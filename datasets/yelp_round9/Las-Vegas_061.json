            "review": "This rating is a combination of two elements, food and service.  Food = 5 stars, Service = 1.5.\n\nFood:\n\nI have dined here twice.  I do not recall what I had on my first visit, but I know I left happy and someone I was with at the time said it was one of the best meals they ever had.  I went again a couple weeks ago and got the Parallels menu.  If you are unfamiliar that menu comes with five courses.  Each course has two distinct dishes with one common ingredient.  I have never seen anything like this and loved the concept.  Everything was cooked to perfection and I really enjoyed every course.  One of the people I was with ordered the salmon and was not happy with the the dish, not the way it was cooked (overdone).\n\nService:\n\nThe service was done in a team of two.  The first server was very nice, gave us our menus answered any quick questions and then disappeared forever.  Too bad.  Our second server was terrible.  Horrible at answering our questions on the menu, always in a huge hurry, and didn't seem to care at all about the service.  Although I did not buy the wine, I will add this from the person who did:  The electronic menu SUCKS! and our sommelier was great and very helpful.  A restaurant of this caliber has to excel in all areas and sadly Aureole nailed the food 75% and completely blew the service."

            "review": "Finally ate here for restaurant week a couple of days ago.  \n\nI was just surprised by the size of this restaurant hiding in Mandalay.  Staff was great period. \n\nKnown for their outrageous wine selection and of course a very creative way of getting your bottle.  I watched a lady employee strapped to some cables and just riding it up and down, but didn't get a bottle that day.  It was pretty cool.  \n Aureole-Dinner $50.10\nAddress: 3950 Las Vegas Blvd South Las Vegas, NV 89119\nPhone: 702 632-7401\nWebsite: Link to Website\nReservations: Click for Reservations\nDonor Level:  Dinner: Gold Plate\nDinner\n\n-- $50.10 --\n\n\nFirst Course\nFrisee Salad \"Gourmande\" \nFoie gras torchon, poached egg, black mission figs\n\nOr\n\nBraised Octopus and Maine Lobster Salad \nWarm pewee potato, tarragon vinaigrette\n\n\nSecond Course\nCrispy Duck Leg Confit \nLyonnaise potatoes, wilted greens, ice wine reduction\n\nOr\n\nBeef Short Rib and Togarashi dusted Ahi Tuna Loin \nBroccoli puree, saut\u00e9ed porcini mushrooms, hand rolled potato gnocchi\n\n\nThird Course\nLate Summer Peach Brown Butter Tart \nPeach buttermilk sherbet, amaretto anglaise\n\nOr\n\nDark Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar \nCandied peanuts, honey caramel sauce\n\n These were the choices!  My bf and I usually wont' get the same stuff so we can pick at each other's yummy food.\n\nThe 1st course was good because it was just so...so.so..I don't know how to describe it.  DIFFERENT? lol. It was honestly good.  Well for my taste buds. I had the 1st choice and never had poached eggs on a salad before.  Luckily I love eggs so I was down.  Just so many different flavors.  The only thing I didn't like was my dessert.  The peach brown butter tart was okay. I got tired of it after a little while.  It seemed \"bready\"?  The sherbert was a little tart.  I had to close my eyes when I put it in my mouth.  hahahahha.\n\nOther than that I would love love to go back to Aureole!\n\nOH P.S.  They had awesome BAR FOOD!!!!  When we walked in there were hella people at the bar.  They called it \"small plates\".  We tried the pulled pork sliders.  So good."

            "review": "This review is mainly for the bar. We ate in the restaurant on Christmas Day a few years ago (Swan Court) & had an excellent tasting menu dinner. But it is the bar we consistently return to time and time again.\n\nFirst off, the bartenders are terrific - friendly and knowledgeable. We always sit at the bar (rather one of the tables) as we enjoy chatting with the bartenders. We look forward to seeing Dave each Christmas visit (we miss his fellow bartender David, who moved out of state).\n\nThe bar menu is delicious - sliders and French Onion soup (made with four gras) are highlights, but we usually order a few items off the dining room a la carte menu as well.\n\nDrinks are always stellar, and often when chatting with the bartenders about various liquors, we are offered a free taste or two of this or that. I'll never forget the taste of 1972 Pedro Jimenez that we were given a few years ago - a rarity that is now nearly impossible to find.\n\nThis isn't one of those raucous Vegas nightclubs, but a nice cozy bar where you can relax and enjoy good drinks, good food, and good conversation."

            "review": "Before heading to the JAY Z concert, my BFF Lily and I wanted to grab drinks (aperitif). With so many options near the Mandalay Bay Events Center, it was difficult to make an immediate decision. Also, since Lily is visting, I told her to choose and I am very happy she chose Aureole!\n\nWe walked up to the host stand and informed the hostess that we were in search of their bar, so we were directed in via elevator or stairs. We happily took the stairs to admire the vast wine collection. I had heard of Aureole's monstrous wine collection (for the record, it is a four-story stainless steel tower of over 50,000 wines including the \"Millennium Collection\" that features the first Bordeaux growth from the 1900 vintage - HOLY MOLY) and flying \"wine angels,\" but didn't take the time to appreciate it. It is quite the sight.\n\nOnce you get to the dining room, there is another host stand when you exit the stairs and we were graciously directed to the bar behind the stars (it's under and on the side of the stairs). Fortunately, the were two seats at the end and we were greeted immediately with menus. We arrived just minutes before the end of their Happy Hour (7pm) and without even having to ask, we were given Happy Hour menus without restrictions of not being able to order. That was refreshing!\n\nI ordered the Enlightenment (Citron Vodka, St Germain Elderflower Liqueur, Lemon, Moscato d'Asti float) cocktail for a very cool $6. It was delicious and not overly sweet and most importantly, it contains all my favorite things! Lily had The Mountie (Canadian Club Whiskey, Peach Cordial, Lemon) cocktail and it was also delicious ($6). Both were only available on the Happy Hour menu.\n\nSince I was hungry and we were in no hurry, I decided to peruse the menu. Both the Small Plates and A La Carte Dinner menus offer the \"Artisanal Cheese\" dish ($18) and I confirmed with the bartender that it is indeed the same offering even though each menu has different names and descriptions. This cheese plate is beautiful and really, really delicious. It featured six cheeses: Big Rock Blue cheese from California, Nerina goat cheese from Italy, MouCo Pepper Camembert from Colorado, Brillat Savarin cheese from France (triple cream Brie), Goat Blue Log from Massachusetts, and Beecher's Flagship Reserve from Washington (semi-hard cow's milk cheese; aged cheddar). They served it with lightly toasted brioche and white chocolate batard, candied pecans, caramelized red onion marmalade, and wine-reconstituted golden raisins. Phenomenal. If you like blue cheese, the two offerings were great. The cheeses that really stood out for me were the Nerina, MouCo, and Brillat Savarin. They all happen to be creamy cheeses, but the flavors were just amazing.  I would absolutely order it again and hopefully when they still have these particular cheeses! I will be on a mission to purchase those favorites.\n\nI have to devote a paragraph to our lovely bartenders David and Dave. They were amazing. The pinnacle of excellent service and craft. They were charismatic, helpful, and very humorous. Dave (or David, I honestly can't remember who is who since they had the same name) was even kind enough to supply all the cheese information so that I wouldn't forget the delicious cheeses we devoured. When I return, there is no question that I will go to the bar!"

Didnt eat dinner though, just drinking wine in the lounge area and eating dessert.  They have those cool electronic menus when you pick your wine.  They only give it to you if you buy a bottle though, so if you want to plan with one, you gotta buy a bottle. From $38 half bottles up to $ hundreds"

            "review": "Sighhhhhh.  My wife has been wanting to dine at Aureole for quite some time so I finally obliged her and made a reservation.  Sadly for the restaurant, I'm not sure we even needed the res, and it was a Friday night.\n\nBread - 3 options, Rosemary, Pretzel, and (i forget the third, didn't try it).  The Rosemary was warm, fluffy, and worth a second go around.  If you've dined out at all in the last 12-18 months you probably have noticed that pretzel bread is all the rage and can be found almost anywhere.  Unfortunately, it really misses the mark here.  Maybe we were just unlucky, but the bread was room temp and fairly dry.\n\nApps - Here is where a little disappointment grew.  If you attempt to check out Aureole online, you will find a much different menu than what you will find in person.  I had my heart set on a shrimp scampi app prior to coming but soon found it was not available.  I was torn between two options and went with the French Onion Soup based on the waiters recommendation.  I'd say it was average, better than what you might get at a chain restaurant but not the best I've had.  My wife went with the crab risotto which was more pricey but also hearty and rich.  I would recommend it as an app to split because I think like my wife, most women would give up on the dish before finishing it.\n\nEntrees - If you don't have an extra large appetite, the ahi tuna and scallop entree is a good option.  The tuna was high quality and cooked rare.  The scallops were also cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the spice level of the dish.  However, the portion is not very large so if your stomach is growling, you might feel like this entree is more like an appetizer.  My wife went with a lamb chop special which was nice.  The chops were fairly large in size and cooked perfectly.  Overall, she was happy with her selection and it was plenty of food for her.\n\nDessert - We went with the chocolate trio which is nice because it is like 3 desserts in one and is perfect for two people to split.  The fondue was my favorite of the three but the donut was not as good as a similar option we always get at Scarpetta.  Also, I forget what the middle option was called but it came with some coated bacon strips.  I think added a salty element (especially bacon) is also a very \"in\" think to do with desserts now, but the bacon here just amount to a hassle.  After only one bite it just stuck to all my teeth and was pretty annoying.\n\nLastly, our service wasn't bad or slow but Jerry Seinfeld might describe our waiter as a \"low talker.\"  Eventually I just gave up listening to his recommendations because I couldn't hear a word he was saying.\n\nAll in all Aureole was okay, but nothing struck me as unique or superior to the many similar options in Vegas, so I can't say I would prefer to come back versus trying somewhere new."

            "review": "The food was just a-ok, but what really makes me mad about wasting my very precious time was being herded through our dining experience like unwanted in-laws.\n\nWe are all about the bar food - looked forward to hanging out in the Tower Lounge and watching the wine angels float up to the top to get that coveted bottle of wine.\n\nSo we get there at 9:15pm and were prompted seated in the Tower Lounge bar. Ordering wine is not the easiest thing to do in this place. With over 50,000 bottles or whatever they have, it's hard to figure out what to get. Plus, in our price range, I had no idea what would be better - the unoaked Chardonnay from Australia or the Sauvignon Blanc from Chile.\n\nThe waiter/maitre d' guy was no help so he sent over someone pretending to be a sommolier. When I asked what he thought of the unoaked Chardonnay, he replied \"Well, it's good. It's an unoaked Chardonnay so it will be less oaky.\" WTF? \n\nWhatever, I ordered a bottle and we decided on a couple appetizers to start. But get this - the appetizers arrived before the wine did.\n\nAnd I was barely finished eating when the busboy/annoying ahole picked the plate off the table. I am ALL for clearing the table after dinner, but come on...\n\nThe waiter dude didn't even ask if we enjoyed the wine or the food.\n\nThen - at 9:50p, he drops the bill on our table and thanks us for coming. Really? We were in and out within 35 minutes? You have GOT to be KIDDING.\n\nWished I would have gone elsewhere. That was not the dining out experience we had hoped for."

            "review": "Aureole is serious about it's wine, and to emphasize this fact, guests are greeted by a 42-foot high glass-encased tower housing part of it's wine collection. Wines are listed in and ordered from wireless electronic wine tablets (with accompanying guides). Kind of gadgety, but fun nonetheless. Wines are then retrieved by wine angels suspended by wires from the ceiling a la Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible...it's quite a show. If only the food were able to match this spectacle. That's not to say it was bad, but it was rather uneven. The meal got off to a good start with the Hawaiian Ahi Tuna Trio, a refreshingly light treatment of impeccable tuna. Slow Braised Beef Shank and Foie Gras Ravioli was unfortunately stringy and not tender though it did have good flavor. Olive Oil Poached Oregon Petrale Sole seemed to have been poached at too high a temperature and was tough as well. Modesto County Pan-Seared Rabbit was nicely done with good earthy flavors, but the Duo of Beef Tenderloin and Flat Iron again disappointed with overdone meat. We concluded with a nice cheese course with brioche (how about a bit more fruit for this??) and concluded with a delicious Meyer Lemon Parfait with Lemoncello Sorbet. At a restaurant of this stature, things such as overdone meats should never happen...it makes the kitchen seem amateurish. Which is really too bad since we enjoyed the rest of our evening. This makes me wish Charlie Palmer would try to lure Michael (or Bryan) Voltaggio back to his group in partnership to kickstart this place."

Why do you hostesses do this? Besides that unsettling comment, it was perfect. Bountiful breads, wonderful cavier, except it saddened me that they didn't offer Champagne by the glass to pair with it. I wouldn't really expect them to, but it would have been nice to have since I wasn't going to order a bottle for just myself! I settled for the only appropriate sparkling wine they offered by the glass instead. The service was simply outstanding and the staff was very attentive and extremely accomadating with special requests, as they should be. The salad (caprese style) melted in my mouth, and the salmon was perfection. The little mini desserts were the icing on the cake."

            "review": "What a shame.  A friend and I, both self-proclaimed foodies, came here for dinner last week, and it started off great.  The restaurant is beautiful, the towering wine cellar is amazing, and everything on the menu sounded great.  In addition, the prices were quite reasonable!\n\nWe each ordered an appetizer and an entree.  My friend also ordered a side dish, spinach gratin, to go with his entree.\n\nThe service unfortunately was a bit slow.  Bread took a while to come out.  Drinks were not refilled.  Slight annoyance, but I forgot about that after I tasted the food, which was fantastic.  I had a yellowtail crudo which was out of this world good, and my friend had a seared foie gras with strawberries, which was interesting and delicious!\n\nOur entrees arrived (a halibut in Japanese broth, and a mediterranean-style escolar, both very well prepared), but my friend's side dish was nowhere to be found.  We assumed that the waiter would deliver that separately after dropping off our entrees.  But unfortunately, the waiter never came back.  He did not even come back to ask if the meal was ok.\n\nWe did flag him down eventually and ask about the gratin.  He said \"Oh yes!\", and quickly walked away.  No doubt he forgot about it.  We continued on with our delicious meal.\n\nAs we took our last bites, the side dish still had not arrived.  We decided to cancel the gratin, but by the time we found our waiter, he was already bringing out the gratin.  There were no apologies about the delay, no excuses made, nothing.  He dropped it off like it was nothing.  My friend (knowing how sharp tongued he can be) was already holding back and very nicely hinted to the waiter that we were already done with our meal.  Our waiter said \"Well, this is still good, it's still hot\" and walked away.\n\nTrying to not let this incident ruin our meal, we let it go.  However, it quickly became apparent to us that this spinach gratin was quickly thrown together in a hurry.  The spinach was watery and there were no signs of this being a \"gratin\", in that the cheese on top was barely melted, there was no crust, no browned cheese... it was just a mess.  It was disgusting to the point where I would not even expect to eat this at El Pollo Loco or Koo Koo Roo.\n\nOur waiter asked how the gratin was, and we told him it was not done very well.  He said \"Ok, I'll let the kitchen know.\"  His attitude by this point was he felt we were just bothering him and wish we would leave.  My friend finally said, \"No, we were already done with our meal, this side dish came late, and on top of that, it was gross.\"\n\nThe waiter said annoyingly, \"Ok, I'll take that off your bill, oh geez.\"\n\nMind you, this is a high-end restaurant in Las Vegas.  I was very surprised and disappointed in this attitude.\n\nIf it weren't for the service, I would give this place 4 or 5 stars.  But the service ruined the experience and for that, this place gets 3 stars."

We all ordered a-la-carte (not pri-fixe), and the food was pretty fantastic.\n\n- bread: the pretzel bread was strange - too salty. rather than butter, it needed some wetzel's pretzels dipping cheese!\n- Pineapple Mojito: their specialty drink. It was a good mojito, but I couldn't taste the pineapple!\n- Porcini ravioli with a goat cheese foam and kale: excellent and filling dish. The bitterness of the kale balanced out the creamy, soft texture of the ravioli. Porcini was aplenty\n- Salmon Entree: delicious, but to me, slightly overcooked and dry in the middle\n- Roasted Chicken: juicy and excellent\n- Tenderloin w/ Crab and Sweet POtato Mash: perfectly cooked and soft meat. The crab complimented it very well\n- Pork Chops: cooked well, but tasted a bit too gamey for me.\n\nOne of my friends found a white \"hair\" in her dish and told the server. He apologized, and later the owner/manager returned and explained it was a brush bristle. He assured us that the dish would be taken off the tab, and gave her a NICE bag of gourmet truffles. Now THAT's service.\n\nI give this place 4 stars because prices are pretty up there, and I think the dishes could have been seasoned with a bit more risk/flavor. This is definitely a place to try at least once - you will not be disappointed."

From the moment you see the wine cellar, which is obviously the centerpiece of this amazing restaurant, to your interaction with the hostess, to the walk down past all of the wine bottles, to the comfortable, relaxed ambiance of this restaurant, you get the sense that you have been transported somewhere, far away from the incessant noise of the slot machines, drunk bar patrons, and crying children that exist not 100 feet away.  \n\nThe wait staff is Johnny-on-the-spot without being overly intrusive, which is sometimes a hard thing to balance.  The were all very helpful and ready with suggestions, including one that actually saved us money by telling us about an option we weren't aware of.  \n\nNaturally, we had wine. I assume you'd be tossed out and not invited back if you didn't, given the effort they put into the cellar.  The wines were marked up the typical amount for restaurants of this caliber, and we found one that we'd enjoyed before at a reasonable price (reasonable for Vegas, not for Total Wine). We watched the wine angel grab it and bring it down, which is always an interesting experience, given its uniqueness.  \n\nThe steaks were easily some of the best I've had in Vegas, easily comparable with the best steakhouses I've tried, and I have visited nearly every casino's offerings.  The wife (M) and I went with friends this time, and all of us raved about this dinner for weeks afterwards.  I asked M if she wanted to hit Aureole when we go back to Vegas this month, and got an immediate \"Hell Yes!\" so I'm not sure you can get a better recommendation than that.\n\nThanks for a great experience, Aureole, and I can't wait to eat there again."

But, in the case of Aureole...I wish we had known better.\n\nThis restaurant is beautiful.  We were seated at a table with our own private outdoor area.  Our table was inside, and we had french doors that opened up to our private patio with another table that was right next to a pool that had swans swimming back and forth.  It was so romantic and beautiful.  We went outside once or twice to smoke a cigarette (since the dinner experience was 3 hours long) and to have dessert out there.  The swans swimming 2 feet next to us was a nice touch...although they didn't seem people-friendly.  It was a dining experience I'll never forget...sitting out there in the warm desert night with swans surrounding us.\n\nThe thing I didn't really like about Aureole was that we had to choose from either a $120 pre fix menu or a more expensive pre fix menu option (I think it was $200 but I cant remember).  So, with wine and tip we ended up paying more than expected.  I would have appreciated if we were allowed to choose our items a la cart, instead of being forced to have a tasting menu.  The food was a solid 3.  It was good, but not memorable.  \n\nOne really cool thing was the touch screen computer/tablet they gave us as their wine list.  It was an actual laptop.  Pretty high tech.\n\nBe prepared to drop BANK here, but you wont have a bad experience.  Just an expensive one."

For dinner, we had the prefixed 3 course entree.  They were very good, but definitely not the best in Vegas.

At the end, they brought out extra glasses of wine and desserts (you might laugh, but their sorbet was THE BEST), offered us to meet the chef and tour the kitchen- we were too stuffed for that type of activity.

I love that but it could have used a bit more - no worries, a shot of sriracha did the trick table side.  Main entree was a swordfish steak with a pepper coulis - delish.  People that like desserts would love this - I had 5 minis in front of me when I only picked 1 from the prix fixe.  Bonus!"

The wine menu large and greatly varied! Some disappointing items, the dessert menu! A true let down for such a wonderful menu. Also the bread a big disappointment. The staff just some of them. I asked about a dress code and was told shorts and a polo were good. So when we arrived the host down stairs in the main dinning room gave myself and my guests the up and down look and stare like \"why are you eating here you clearly should not be here\", and the burger joint is down the hallway of the casino! However the waiter was great, knowledgeable and helpful! Some of the other staff were treating us as if we did not belong as well. This being said myself and my friend both have hospitality degrees in food and beverage and hotel management! Also my friend is a high end slots manager! We know what to look for."

If you don't want to read the rest, simply know that going to this place provides an exceptional dining experience.\n\nOur group was about eight people, and we were seated in a nice corner near the rear windows. Every staff person from the person who took our reservation out front to the head waiter was like your own personal servant. Our primary waiter was just like Nathan Lane, in appearance, comedic demeanor, and professionalism that exudes high-class even if he is sharing a joke with a kid in jeans and a T-shirt (which is basically what I was wearing).\n\nWe ordered from across the dinner and drinks menu and everything tasted wonderful and was cooked perfectly. They also had some special set meal choices that are an excellent deal for the price. I particularly liked their cheese and honeycomb appetizers. Their desserts are rich and flavorful, and taste much better than the same sort of desserts at other restaurants.\n\nIf you're going to pick a fancy restaurant to dine at in Las Vegas, I recommend this restaurant. There are other restaurants that are similar in price but provide no where near the quality of atmosphere, staff, and food as Aureole."

It was a nice oasis from the crowds flooding the rest of Mandalay Bay.\n\nThe wine tower they have is definitely worth a look.  It's a pretty neat system where the wine stewards get in a harness and have to zip up the side of the tower to get the bottles high up.  The tablet PC wine menu also gets them points for the fun factor for gadget geeks like me.\n\nWe had a very good Australian grenache, and a few of their desserts.  Both the wine and food were excellent.\n\nI will say that the wine was EXPENSIVE.  There are not many bottles on their list that I would consider good deals (or even truly affordable for that matter) but the ambiance and service still merit this establishment five stars."

So of course I selected Aureole because of it's legendary wine list.  Because it's all about their wine.\n\nWalking into the restaurant, the stairwell winds around the famous wine pillar.  Your decent into the eatery gives you a close-up view of the Plexiglas, temperature controlled behemoth. I thought I would get a close up view of the \"Wine Angels\" zipping up and down, but unfortunately, there was no action in the tower, despite the fairly full restaurant.  It was a little like walking through the local wine shop.  A lot of wine, but no pretty women zipping around on cables.  Obviously, Aureole isn't focused on the \"Wine Angels\"; it's all about their wine.\n\nI was a little surprised when we sat down with our menus, but were not automatically presented with the wine list.  As an aspiring wine snob, I know that I need to view both menu and wine list simultaneously to pair the best wine with the food I'm going to eat.  That's when I realized the catch to Aureole; They offer -almost push- the fixed price dining with wine parings. Therefore, all the wines being paired that night will not be in the big tower, but someplace far more convenient for the staff.  It makes sense, but I wanted to see girls swinging from cables.   So I asked for the wine list, with the intent of ordering a bottle from the top of the pillar.  It may be all about theie wine, but I can't pass up a good show, regardless of the cost.\n\nI got the wine list - a computer tablet that is so vast, it's practically useless.  You can narrow selections by country, region, and varietal, but not by something more useful to me, like flavor notes, or tower location.  So now I have a list that allows me to select from seemingly every wine in the world, and now I have to narrow it down to one or two.  And I want it to be high up on the wine tower, on the side I can see from my table.  This is clearly not the objective of Aureole.  They want to give you a great meal with a wine they have already selected.  They even charge you an extra $10 per meal if you sit in the swan court, out of the view of the wine tower.  It's all about *their* wine.\n\nNext the sommelier came over to help us with our wine selection.  He was only 15-30 seconds behind the wine list, so clearly we were not expected to actually peruse all 9,865 bottles.  It's more like, \"ok, here's the list you twit, now let me tell you what you want.\"  They probably carry your favorite wine, but it's all about THEIR wine.\n\nWe intended to spend the evening here, so I figure I'll start with a cheese course (steering clear of the prix fixe menu) and the sommelier unwittingly insults me by saying most people go straight to the reds, since that's what I did in my first 15 seconds with the tablet.  In reality, I was looking up a pricey wine that I am familiar with - so I could ballpark what their price mark-up is.  Now all bets are off.  I tell him I want a bottle from the top of the pillar, so we can see the girls zipping around.  Once we know what that wine is going to be, then we can build our meals around that.  He talks into his lapel like a secret service agent and ZING!  A Wine Angel zips to the top, left and right and back down again in a little flying demonstration.  My mission was a success, and I didn't have to actually get a $2000 bottle of wine.  I was off the hook, quite cheaply, and Aureole maintains their goal of keeping it all about their wine.\n\nAs for everything else, we ordered and the food was great.  The sommelier selected wines by the glass for us (that were also the same wines that they were serving with their fixed price meals) and it was all very good.  And we got out cheaper than we would of if we got the 3 course fixed price dinner.  It was a 4 star dinner, and a 5 star sommelier, but his inferring that I was a commoner will cost them a 5 star rating. I am a commoner, but he shouldn't treat me as such.  The atmosphere was also pretty poor - too many tables, and the wait staff was stretched too thin, a real 3 star effort in the dining room.  But as critical as I can be, Aureole earns 4 stars for the excellent wines served with our dinner, because...\n\nWell, you know."

Depending on how you view it, it can work for as a great date place or a good business dinner. \n\nFood: The food was good but not amazing. The portions were pretty generous though. And I don't know if it was by mistake or because they had too much food but we ended up getting more dishes than we ordered--on the house. It was a nice gesture but I was completely stuffed before our entrees even came out.\n\nSpicy coconut lemon grass broth - I'm not a fan of spicy but it was a light way to start the meal. \nSpinach composition of ahi tuna and alaskan crab - yummy! But I'm a big fan of seafood and tartar so this was going to be delicious to me by default. \nSeared foie gras - I love foie gras and while this one tasted good, I've had better. But still good nonetheless\nHoused cured salmon - Another light way to start the meal, delicious. \nHand cut fettuccine de mare - Good but a bit on the heavy side for an appetizer. Who starts with pasta as an appetizer? This is probably what made me full--not to mention they gave us huge portions of this. \nBeef wellington - A LOT of meat to eat. Either I was too full by this point or I just wasn't feeling it. \nPancetta wrapped monkfish - This was good too but another heavy entree. This probably could have filled me up all on its own. The fish was cooked nice though. \nChocolate raspberry bar - A slightly heavier way to finish off the meal (by this point, I was ready to throw up because I was so full)\n\nThey also gave complimentary chocolate bars courtesy of.....some dessert chef. Truffle chocolates were delicious. \n\nService: A little slow but it was Valentine's and it was crowded. Our reservation wasn't until 9PM so I was surprised at how long our meal took (we ended up leaving right before midnight) but everyone working was hustling that night so I'm just going to assume there were way too many people that night."

It's good - particularly the food, but it's impossible for me to overlook several missteps. For starters, our hostess was actually having a conversation on a Bluetooth as she seated us. Although we had reservations and it was so early that we were one of the first tables seated, we were not given a seating option with our table (maybe it would have been impossible without interrupting our hostess). We ended up in the Swan Court, which is nice, but it kills any chance to see the restaurant's famous \"wine angels\" in action. The waiter appeared shortly thereafter to take cocktail orders. I asked for a Hendrick's martini. He comes back in 15 seconds to say they have no Hendrick's... and suggests Absolut or Grey Goose as an alternative. Um, Forbes Four Diamond and the server doesn't know a proper martini is made with gin? Call me a snob, but that's bad. Once we sort out what a martini involves, lo and behold we find that they do have Hendrick's. The drink came out perfectly, but then the wine list showed up. Aureole cleverly puts their very impressive list on an iPad. The good part of that is the lack of pressure and ease of exploration. The bad part for us was the utter lack of attention from our server - he didn't ask what we liked to drink or planned to eat; in fact, he said nothing. Just the thunk of the iPad on the table. I suppose I expected a bit more, but we agreed upon a bottle and it was fine. Between the waiter and the hostess, I was starting to worry about the food, but the bread service started to allay those concerns. It was excellent, fresh and creative, which typified the rest of our meal. The service evened out and became passable, and w enjoyed a very reasonable prix fixe menu that was very well executed and satisfying. It was far from a perfect evening, however. If only the service matched the cuisine."

The bar staff really needs a lot of work here...\n\nThe whole bar staff was clearly fake. You feel like you are the centerpiece of a southern belle dinner. The tone of their conversation to you, and the stupid jokes they drop could pass very well if you were on the croquet court hanging with the Docker's models all with pink sweaters worn over your shoulders. They were like airline stewardesses with plastic smiles chiseled into their faces. (Hopefully, one of those analogies rang a bell with you...). This whole environment made me feel ultra-uncomfortable, which of course made me very nitpicky... \n\nI sat down at the bar since I was dining alone, and the bartender asked me what I wanted to drink. I told him that I really liked traditional drinks, and wondered if he had something awesome in his back pocket that he could mix up. He told me that they made \"award winning\" appletinis, cosmos, and some other glammed up sugar bullshit. Seriously, this is the best you could think of?? minus 1. \n\nSo, I asked him for a gin martini, and wanted to know what gin he had on the bar. He could only list the boring shit off the top of his head (tanq, bombay, etc.), he had to go sift through the bar to figure out the interesting kinds of gin he had. He then asked if I wanted a twist. This seems to be a major problem with Vegas since I got asked it at more than one classy place...martinis have olives. *ALWAYS*. If you ask if I want olives or a twist, then you clearly don't know how to make a martini. Minus another 1.\n\nHe then makes my martini and gives me the check. No mention of food or anything. At this point, I'm convinced that he was trying to kick me out of the place. Like, to the point where I started looking around at how other people were dressed. I also thought about trying to find a mirror to see if I had a giant booger stuck to my chin. I nearly walked out after paying for my drink, but the bartender did notice *after I had finished the whole drink* that maybe I would want some food, and asked if I wanted a menu. I decided to give the food a spin, and was treated to a fantastic swordfish. Like I mentioned before, kudos to the chef...its sad that his great meal was really hurt by bad service.\n\nWith the exception of the cool wine tower/cellar thing in the middle of the room, the bar decor sucked...it might as well have been a wall street bank. I dunno, maybe it would be cool if you were here for a business dinner, or if you wanted to shag your significant other. I couldn't think of any other party that may feel less out of place here."

In my experiences of highly rated, high class restaurants they usually tell you what is on the plate. Here, they did not do that. The food we had was quite good. \nIm only giving this place a 1 star because I have to. The Sommelier was extremely friendly and very helpful. The food was really good but with such low quality of service it really left a bad taste in my mouth. (yes, that is what she said) \nI was so excited to try this place but I will never go back."

It's just an overpriced poser of a restaurant catering to small town tourists who wouldn't know good food if it bit them on the neck.  And it says it has a one star Mechelin review?  It does NOT deserve it.  Most of the service was fairly good, but the Sommelier was a standoffish snob.  Once I showed him I knew a lot about wine (I'm a Somm myself), he gave me several tastes so I could select a wine that paired well with my meal, but his constant eye rolling and side-handed smirks really detracted from the service and cast a cloud over the overall experience.  The food was overcooked, soggy, not fresh, underwhelming, under-flavored, and flaccid.  In summary, overpriced, underwhelming, and not worth your time, your money, and definitely not a Michelin star."

Every person at the restaurant bent over backward to make sure the event was perfect. We had tons of help setting up the room, and the manager personally brought me a martini to sip at while we worked.\n\nThe room was understated elegance with lots of orchids & candles on the table. The food, from passed hors d'ouevres to the AMAZING French onion soup, steak and desserts was fantastic. \n\nI would not hesitate to plan another event at Aureole. The atmosphere and food were too notch and the service was above and beyond.\n\nThank you for a wonderful event, Aureole!"

The first couse for me was foie gras which was served with a pear tarte tatin followed by pork tenderloin and pork belly with mashed sweet potatoes.  The pork was very tasty, but I wouild have liked a little more heat (temperature).  My friend wanted a classic meal and ordered Caesar salad followed by Filet Oscar.  She was very happy. \n\nA nice bottle of Laetitia Pinot Noir was recommended and enjoyed.\n\nAmbience is comfortable, the wine tower is impressive.  I highly recommend."

I started in the bar with a tangerine mojito, which was one of those drinks that tasted delicicous and benign to boot, until I reached the bottom and realized, um, there might have been a little rum in that wee glass. Oopsie.\n\nCracking on, since our party was pretty large we had a set menu in a private dining room. While I was disappointed not to be able to watch the wine angels scurry up and down, it was probably best that we had our own space to yammer away in.\n\nAm I allowed to rave about bread in this day and age? Aureole serves these petite, warm, dark rolls that taste exactly like hot pretzels. It's possible I had 2. Cue sound of Atkins turning in grave.\n\nI'm ashamed to say that my first course was a beet salad - SHOCKER - one of my favorite places to start. This one was tasty, though not especially memorable, possibly since by then I was already on my second glass of '99 Brunello. If you're an oenophile, by the way, arrive 20 minutes before your rezzo and ask for the wine last, an electronic tablet which allows you to scrolls through their deep, expensive but fantastic wine list. \n\nOut came the mains, and my plate featured salmon with pancetta, cooked to perfection. But wow, that brunello was really kicking in by now so don't ask me to reel off side items. All I recall is it that it was extremely tasty.\n\nFor dessert, I bucked the trend of my table and had a meyer lemon tart. Should have gone with the chocolate souffle. It was fine enough but reminded me of the lemon curd my granny used to offer me to put on my toast.\n\nBetween the salmon, the wine, the company, and that surreally good bread, I had a pretty splendid meal. The app and dessert were fine, though nothing outstanding. I'd go again to sit outside in the main restaurant - especially if someone else was paying."

This is comprised of seven courses, the first five small, the sixth being a main meal although still not a large proportion, and dessert. The portions were just right in order to be able to feel full in the end. The cost is $145. We did not choose the wine pairing which would have cost another $95 on top of the $145 and instead just ordered one glass of Pinot Noir which was delicious.\nIt started with a very nice beef carpaccio, followed by an absolutely delicious scallop,  followed by fois gras with waffle and strawberry, leading to an incredibly delicious Seabass and then one had a choice between the duck or lamb and I chose the lamb which was delicious. The dessert was a delicious pannacotta that was just too beautiful to look at. Overall, it was a good meal. I was not crazy about the fois gras and have had better yet otherwise it was lovely. The service was outstanding, the ambience relaxing, and the restaurant is beautiful. I would have given this 4 1/2 stars but it lost half a star because of the meal that I mentioned that wasn't as good. For the amount of money paid, I would've expected each part of the meal to be outstanding. Regardless, would easily go back as absolutely delicious."

We were sat in a booth looking out the back of the restaurant at two swans and a beautifully lit little pond.\n\nOur server was super nice.  We were first offered the price fixe menus which are a bit pricey, but when I asked for the a la carte menu and small plates menus, it was gladly accepted.  We ordered four different items.\n\nThe first dish was a smoked salmon dish which I thought was ok, but a bit tangy/spicy.\n\nThe next dish was buttered asparagus.  Although it was simply prepared, the asparagus was delish.  There were about 20 sticks of asparagus.  Yum...\n\nThe next dish was a ravioli dish with peas and crab I think.  It was a nice dish with lots of butter also.\n\nThe best dish was the black cod.  It was so tender.  I just wish that the piece was a bit bigger.  It was only about 3 inches long and an inch high.  \n\nWe were offered four different types of bread.  Sourdough, pretzel, focaccio and wheat?  \n\nWe had two nice glasses of wine, a reisling and a tempranillo.\n\nThe total was $138 with tip.  We didn't finish all of the food or wine but walked away very satisfied."

I was so taken away by all the great things that night that I've had a hard time describing it, and even now would I not be able to truly explain my experience. I will say this: both my and my date's plates were left clean, without a single piece of food left. Every glass of wine was beautifully paired up with each course. All was cooked to perfection, and the grape sorbet was so amazing I nearly cried. The atmosphere was intimate and they even had live music. All the people that served me, including the woman at the reservations desk were genuine, helpful, and eager to please. We even had the opportunity to see the chef in person, as he visited the adjacent table. I know this is not my strongest review, and perhaps I will update next time I visit, but it was truly the highlight of my trip."

It was restaurant week, so I'll give them that they were probably a bit busier than usual.  We were a bit of a larger table, so I will say that might have been tough.  The first misstep was when we were in the bar grabbing drinks before and we were scolded by the server for walking up to the bar to get our drinks...after we gave our drink order to the server we never saw our drinks.  We were seated and had to reorder drinks.  So that was a weird start to the evening.  The rest of service was great so it was odd that they had this large miscommunication to start things off.  \n\n\nMost people at the table got the restaurant week menu.  The first course was a choice of a salad which was frisee, poached egg, foie gras torchon and bacon lardons or a mussel soup.  Most people got the salad, I think they were impressed that they had foie gras on a restaurant week menu.  But it is restaurant week, it was pretty hard to find the foie gras the pieces were so small.  They said it was good though.  I ordered the foie gras appetizer for my first course.  It was a large piece so they definitely didn't skimp on that.  However it wasn't fully cooked through, there were veins that hadn't melted yet in the piece of foie and had to be sawed through with a knife.  Odd.  It was still tasty and maybe it was just a rare misstep.  My boyfriend got the french onion soup and he said it was delicious, it is served with a puff pastry top that is pretty and tasty.  \n\nEntrees we all ordered from the restaurant week menu.  There were two options.  One was a duck leg confit with lyonnaise potatoes and wilted greens.  The other option was braised beef short ribs and seared ahi tuna with kimchee brussel sprouts.  I had the play on \"surf and turf.\"  It was the best part of the meal for me.  I was kind of curious what a braised beef and rare tuna dish would be like, but it was just amazing.  The textures and flavors were all just stunning.  It was a hit.  The Duck confit looked good, everyone liked it. \n\nDessert options for the restaurant week menu didn't include any chocolate.  I basically don't waste calories on dessert unless it's a chocolate dessert.  I ordered from the regular dessert menu, it was a chocolate tea creme brulee.  It was ridiculous :)  Desserts seemed to go over very well.\n\nI would rate our experience a solid b+  service was actually great after the odd start to things.  Our server was very accommodating and it was nice to be able to kind of mix and match our meals.  The food was good to very good.  I have a lot of restaurants to go to in Las Vegas but I can see bringing some out of towners to impress them at Aureole."

The restaurant setting is great, even though the wine angels weren't working.  Service was really good... our waters were never empty, the bread guy came around twice to give us more pretzel bread, etc.\n\nI had the swordfish and my girlfriend had the sea bass.  We enjoyed her dish a little more, but both were unique offerings and were pretty good.  We're not big eaters, so the two main courses were plenty to get us stuffed, but they had a big dessert menu we really, really wanted to order from.\n\nBonus points to the sommelier for taking care of us.  We inquired why there wasn't a wine flight like on the restaurant.com menu, and he told me they don't do that anymore since nobody ordered it.  But he offered to put one together for us.  When I told him that was OK, he ended up letting us sample a white wine he recommended, and he didn't charge us for it.\n\nNeedless to say I left a generous tip.

So on a Tuesday night, we just showed up there hoping to get in for dinner around 6pm, no reservations. And oh yeah, my hubby who usually dresses appropriately, was only wearing a collared golf shirt and shorts and sandals. Presentable but a little under dressed for this place (he felt a little uncomfortable though :). However, they did not say anything and we had no issues getting in! It is a little complicated, they seem to take your name up in the entry way, but then you walk down to the maitre d' and they ask you again the same questions and if you have reservations...we said no, but I guess checking in at the front door counted at having reservations? We were confused...Then they mentioned something about seating on some side area, outdoors or what...we thought they meant this b/c my hubby was under dressed, that that's the only place they would seat us? After much confusion, we figured out that we can sit 'anywhere' we like, and eat a la carte (they had prix fixed which they seemed to push a lot, but my hubby and I eat different things so the prix fix didnt cover both our 'tastes'). \n\nSo, after the confusing entry, we finally decided to be seated in the lounge area by the bar, right next to the glass tower where the wines are stored..It was very comfy sitting there, felt private too (dining room area was getting fuller as the night went on). \n\nThe food was great! I was worried about portion sizes being too small, but it was more than enough. I had halibut, and got a really big piece of it! Double of what I was expecting. My husband had some red meat (steak) he said it was good. The side dish of risotto would've been wonderful except it was VERY al dente...I mean crunchy still..so that was a bit disappointing...We also tried some cheeses for appetizers, they were amazing! We both loved those, had some huckleberries on the plate too! As for wine, we ordered a bottle of Derbes Pinot Noir ($90 or so, later we found out they 'only' double the price, not tripled like we thought they probably did). But I have to say, when you are at this place, you just have to buy a whole bottle :) \n\nDessert...was amazing! My hubby had 'cocoa infused creme brulee', which tasted superb! I had some dark chocolate dessert with 'pistachio olive oil' ice cream and was heaven! On the side they also brought us some small dessert treats, so that was real nice too. \n\nOverall, great place to try at least once...I would definitely go there for the cheese, wine and dessert... :)"

For my entree, I got the sea bass and I thought the texture was soft and buttery but lacking a bit in flavor. My bf got the bone in rib eye and it was much better. We got asparagus, mushrooms, mac and cheese and corn for sides. The corn was the best because it had a smoky flavor to it. \n\nLast course was dessert and i chose the dessert sampler- it came with nutella creme brulee, cheesecake, chocolate cake, and this light cake thing with blueberry creme on top which was my favorite. They gave us extra sorbet and extra little desserts. All in all the food was ok to me but the decor was one of the most beautiful I have seen."

The food, though, didn't really measure up.  It was okay, but I expected brilliance to match the price and setting.  (I almost want to rate this a 2 out of disappointment.)  I have to admit that the portions were excellent sizes -- no skimping on the appetizers or entrees.  'Entertainment'-wise, I was a bit sad that throughout my leisurely dinner I only saw the wine angels do their thing twice, and once was because a high roller specifically asked to see it.  I understand that it's not a guaranteed thing, of course -- it's not a show -- but as one of the restaurant's main showpieces, I just expected the tower to be more utilized.\n\nWould I return?  Probably not.  It was only okay and there are plenty of other nice restaurants in Vegas."

So why would a restaurant that rated as one of the best wine destinations by Wine Enthusiast magazine only get four stars from me? Because the downstairs bathroom floor was chipped and disgusting and because it took over THREE hours for two people to eat dinner here.  My suggestion: when the waiter asks if you are seeing a show later that you need to keep dinner short, just say, \"Yes.\"  Unfortunately, I can't abide by restaurants that don't keep their bathrooms in decent shape and have slower service then if I had made the food myself and cleaned it all up, too."

I also sell to and meet with tech companies in Las Vegas.  So, I've had over 50 business trips to Vegas in my career and on each visit try a mixture of new places, old standbys and places recommended by friends that live in Vegas.  I'm a foodie and cook that lives in Marin County, so know a little about food, wine and cooking.  And on my business travels I've been fortunate to dine at some of the best establishments in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, New York, L.A., Chicago, Dallas - all around the country and internationally.\n\nOver the past five years our sales team has dined at every restaurant in the Mandalay Bay where Interop is held and have enjoyed each.  We finally decided to splurge and try Aureole.  Overall I'll say that, for the price and the hype, Aureole was mediocre.  Everyone on our team agreed.\n\nFrom reading other reviews it seems the pre fixe and tasting menus are the safe bets.  We all chose to order a la carte. \n\nTwo of us had the New York steak and the cut was overcooked and fatty.  Our VP's octopus was overcooked and chewy.  One person had scallops that were under-seasoned and flavorless.  The creme-brulee was bland.  It's OK to pay these prices for excellent food.  It's disappointing to pay these prices for lackluster preparation.\n\nThe wine list is quite expensive even by Las Vegas standards.  The minimum buy-in for bottles of mid-level Cabernet was $110, with only one or two choices at this price-point.    For comparison, the next night we had a far superior bottles of Cab at Fix in the Bellagio for $80.  \n\nIf you're willing to pay a huge premium to show that you can then this is your restaurant.   If you're ordering the tasting or pre fixe menus, perhaps you'll have a better experience than the a la carte choices.\n\nI'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and perhaps they had an \"off\" night.  However, when a major tech trade show is held on your property I would assume an establishment such as this would be on their A Game.  For our large party we experienced a very expensive C."

Under the blazing summer scorching sun. No doubt we took the taxi back HAHA.\n\nWhen we arrived to our 6pm reservation, we were shown to the lower level where the whole entire restaurant sits! Trippy!! We drank tons of water and then presented our $50 GC from restaurant.com. They gladly took the coupon. There was no snobbish service, but we were not shown the fancy electronic menu many people talked about :'(. They had already assumed that we weren't going to purchase wine from that menu -____-;. Well, fine. We won't order it then. HMPH.\nWe'll just order from our cheap-o Wine Menu then. WHICH wasn't bad anyway because my BF enjoyed his wine a lot..... (GO CHEAP!!!)\n\nWe ordered the seasonal prix fixe. $65/person. 3 Courses.\nSince there were the two of us, and the menu allowed only one person to choose ONE of the two. We were able to try everything on this menu.\n\nHere's my noobish review on the food:\n\nBread: Got the Baguette and Bacon Foccacia. BACON FOCCACIA FOR THE WIN!!!!! NOMS!!!! Too bad it wasn't warm :T\n\nArugula Salad on Crispy Miche Tartine, rhubarb compote, shaved parmesan cheese\n-I thought this was very refreshing, especially after a looooong hot walk. But the arugula started tasting really bitter after many bites. This is a pretty decent sized dish for the first course. The itty bitty extras on this dish complemented the salad well (like the strawberries and the florals) but still I couldn't handle the herby bitterness of it. So my BF happily devoured it, in fact, he actually loved the salad.\n\nChilled Spring Pea Soup, rosemary roasted ham croque-monsieur\n- Honestly, we didn't enjoy this one as much. It's good at first, but then there was so much of it (big bowl) and we got sick of it. This soup is only for pea lovers, I'd say. My dad would hate this because he hates peas with a passion, it's quite funny. The croque-monsieur did save this dish a little bit because it was warm, toasty and yummy and complemented the soup well... but not the entire soup itself. We only ate half of it-at most.\n\nGrilled Cajun Prime Hangar Steak creamy bacon sweet corn, roasted green chilie aioli\n-Holy moly, this was probably the best dish here or in fact the BEST dish of mine and my BF's entire weekend in Vegas!! We ate a lot of good food this weekend too! Jeez the steak was SOOO tender and the flavor was just right!! You get the kick from the cajun seasoning so that was cool. And it sits on a bed of corn... and mashed potatoes?? I don't know what it was, but this dish was freakin' delicious!! I'd definitely order this one if it's still on the menu.\n\nOven Roasted Wild Northwest Halibut preserved lemon and parsley risotto / lobster\n- This one was also VERY good. Didn't wow me like the steak, but this was so flavorful and the Halibut was so meaty delicious! You can definitely taste the lobster flavor and if you're lucky, there's a teeny lobster piece for you to enjoy too! What I liked is that there were a few veggie pieces in this dish. I wish they added more bc I love vegetables!! but the fish was REALLY good. Won't be disappointed.\n\nBananas Foster Tiramisu Parfait, banana cardomom ice cream\nI LOOOOOOOVED THIS DESSERT!!!! I loved the spices and the ice cream was so soothing after a big meal. NOM NOM NOMS!!! This was the BFs but I just stole it from him hehehehe.\n\nDark Chocolate Spearmint Bar, vanilla ice cream\nI ordered this one and MY IS IT CHOCOLATEY! No doubt, it was very good but I think this could only be ordered by absolute-chocolate-lovers and actually finished by them too.\n\nPetit Fours:\nMadeleine, Meringue, Shortbread type of cookie, chocolate, etc\nDelicious :)\n\nOverall it was a very good dinner. I don't mind coming back here again :)"

There are two seating choices, the main dining room and the Swan Court.  We chose the Swan Court which was more private, quiet, and romantic.  The room overlooks a pond that has curious swans swimming about that seemed interested in checking us out.  The only downside to the Swan Court is that there is no view of the Wine Angels flying about in the wine tower to retrieve your special bottle of Vino.\n \nMenu - 4:  You have two options for the menu: 1. A fixed \"Parallel\" menu with two selections for each course.  The Parallel menu is a tasting menu where the selections aren't choices, but both course items are served together, in parallel.  This option can only be selected if the entire table is willing to go with this choice.  2. Select from a traditional style menu with a variety of appetizers, main courses, and sides.  We went with the fixed menu because we loved being able to sample a wide variety of dishes. Either option offered diverse selections.\n\nService - 5:  The is a Four Diamond restaurant so our expectations were fairly high, but Aureole did not disappoint.  Service was fantastic from the moment we entered right up until we left.  My wife has some food allergies and the staff did a phenomenal job accommodating her and modifying some of the dish preparations.\n  \nFood - 5:  Outstanding!  Everything was prepared to perfection.  The dishes were creative both from a culinary and visual perspective.\n\nWine List - 5:  In a word, WOW!  The wine list is on a tablet computer that you can search, sort,  and filter on various criteria (region, vintage, type etc.) to find what suits you.  It's a good thing too, because they have an unbelievable selection.  It's obvious why they have won the Wine Spectator Grand Award every year since 1999.  The sommelier knew the collection very well and and helped us pick out some amazing bottles.  I was blown away.\n \nOverall - 5"

For appetizers there was onion soup, pork belly, cheese platter, seafood platter, and more. The onion soup was underwhelming. The pork. Belly was kind of gross (I love pork belly normally) as it was undercooked. The ravioli it was on top of was good. The cheese platter tries to give a few too many flavors of cheese that you barely get a bite of each. I felt like they should raise price or give smaller selection. This is also how I felt about the seafood platter which was more like a giant bowl of ice. Better to charge a la carte for what was on it so you can make as large as you like. Oh, and the selection of breads they offered seemed old. \n\nMain course I must admit I had a very good bone in rib eye. My cousin got surf and turf, and while the steak was good the lobster tail was not. Very mixed reviews on everything else so general consensus was to stick to steaks. Side selection was tiny and not good. Deserts were average at best. \n\nSorry, just not that great a place."

We were not offered a menu for the 3-course prix fixe ($55 before 7:00, on the sign outside) but offered a $95 4-course. We asked for the 3-course and a new menu arrived (shouldn't have to ask). On this menu the same 4-course on the other menu was now $85 (hmmm). Then our bill came and we were charged $65 (after 7:00 price). That was awkward/unprofessional. A patron shouldn't feel like they're haggling to get the dinner that is offered or at the price it should be.\n\nOtherwise, a must-visit."

The wine collection itself was very impressive, and the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, but the food and service did not live up to my expectation.\n\nWe were seated promptly upon our arrival, and my friend and I were happy to have been able to get a reservation before the Keith Urban concert at Mandalay Bay. I started with the petite greens salad with pears, dried cranberries, and a yummy pear viniagrette. My friend had the onion soup, and it was delicious and decadent with a little foie gras inside. \n\nOur server convinced me to try the monkfish dish on special, and I readily agreed as a love fish, especially monkfish. I was looking forward to the treat. The dish was so creamy it was almost soupy. I generally don't mix cream with fish, not that it can't be done, I just don't generally eat creamy fish dishes. My stomach was more than a little upset after eating half the dish, so I said no to dessert. My friend had the bone-in filet, and it looked and smelled fantastic; however, my stomach was not feeling up to trying a bite. \n\nI felt fine througout the concert, but felt very sick as we arrived back at our rooms at the Bellagio. I didn't feel well all night, and woke up still feeling off. I  can't necessarily attribute my sickness directly to the food at Aureole, but something I ate there did not agree with me. Everything seemed properly cooked, but I guess I will never know for sure. In the least, that monkfish dish should not have been slathered in soupy cream. For this reason, I probably won't be back. I have many other favorites in Vegas that never disappoint.\n\nPerhaps it's worth a try for the ambience and experience of the 4 story wine collection and the \"wine angels,\" but I would go for happy hour and save your pennies for delicious food that can be found elsewhere."

The a la carte menu looked reasonable, but we both opted for the $65 Prix Fixe Menu:\n\nFIRST: \"Argugula Salad\" or \"Chilled Spring Pea Soup\"...soup was very good and came with a ham n cheese melt to supplement, but the wife's salad was better and quite large.   \n\nSECOND: \"Cajun Hanger Steak\"...best steak I've ever had! Juicy, tender, just the right amount of spice, and mouthwatering. If you normally order medium-rare, I would go with medium as it was still pretty bloody...\"Roasted Halibut\" was also fantastic and cooked perfectly, but we both agreed the steak was better.  \n\nTHIRD: \"Chocolate Spearmint Bar\" or \"Bananas Foster Parfait\"...you can't go wrong with either.  They also give you complimentary \"Petite Fours\", nice touch.  They also gave us 4th dessert, for free, which was a tasting of 6 mini scoops of sorbet.  Foooood Cooooommmaaaa...\n\nDon't judge by the outside, the inside is quite huge, elegant, and beautiful.  Service was excellent; it felt like we had 2-3 waiters.  Wine Tower was spiffy, but the cheapest glass of red was $13, white $11...*Sad Frowney Face*.  \n\nThanks to Yelpers and restaurant.com for the $50 Gift Cert that cost me only $6!

We waited for about 10 minutes with another party for someone to show up and greet us.\n\nWe got sat down at the swan court I requested for more a more private feel. We waited another 5 to 10 minutes for our server to come over and greet us. We weren't ready to order our drinks yet so we asked for a couple minutes, he didn't come back for another 15 minutes. The restaurant was probably at a 30% capacity. The busser, however, noticed that we were looking around and provided us with waters without us having to ask.\n\nThe cocktails we ordered weren't that great, at a fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas, you can get much better quality drinks for the same price point. The bread service is also very weak, with a cheap looking slice of french or ciabatta bread. Again, Las Vegas has many other restaurants where you pay over $100 that provide better bread service, and service overall.\n\nWe decided to go with the summer tasting menu, in order to get a little bit of everything. However, for $115, the portions are TOO little. How is the main entree going to be a mere 3 slices of duck breast, or one lamb lollipop? The scallop dish had ONE scallop. The two dishes we enjoyed was the foie gras and the panna cotta. It's way overpriced for what you get, and we left unsatisfied. I'd rather spend an extra $15 per person to dine at Michael Mina in the Bellagio again.\n\nI feel that this restaurant is outdated, as with many of the restaurants at Mandalay Bay when you compare it to the newer places in the center strip. As an MLife gold member, I don't think I'll ever return to this restaurant. Seems like a waste of $330 for two people."

Overall the food and service were good, but not particularly memorable.\n\nI'll admit that we came here to see the wine angels, and when we didn't see any going up we ordered a bottle of wine.  This isn't necessary, by the way, they offered to do a demo for us without making us buy anything.  \n\nWe were seated promptly when we arrived, and while the restaurant was relatively empty initially it filled up pretty quickly.  The first thing they do is present you with a chunky tablet with their wine list; it is an overwhelming list that will just confuse you unless you're a sommellier or have really specific tastes in wine.  It's fun to play with it for 30 seconds and see what they have, but you're better off just asking for the sommellier to come by.  We did that and the sommellier came by, asked us a few questions, and picked out a list of 7-8 wines for us to choose from.  He did a good job, selecting 4-5 wines according to what we described and what we planned on ordering, and a couple other wines that he thought we might like.  \n\nOur waiter was attentive and prompt, but not as knowledgable about the menu as we like.  He didn't know what various markings on the menu were about which was kind of concerning, as an asterisk next to a description of cured meat seems like it would be important.  He didn't know what was in a few dishes as well.  Despite this, once we ordered he struck a good balance of checking on us without getting in our faces too much.\n\nMy wife ordered the cheese plate as an appetizer and I got their take on a french onion soup.  For entrees my wife had the pork chop and I had one of the steaks.  Herein lies the problem with this restaurant; I remember that I had the french onion soup and a steak, and they were good, but I can't remember much else about them other than that the portions were huge.  I remember enjoying it and thinking it was a good steak, but I really can't tell you much about it.  I'd go back if a friend wanted to go, but odds are on my next visit to Vegas this restaurant won't jump to mind.\n\nThat said, the food and service were good.  My only complaint, which most people probably won't share, is that the portions were too big.  I couldn't finish all my food and didn't have room for desert, and walked away feeling really heavy.  I like to get through three courses and not feel like I just ate an entire cow, so this was a bit disappointing.  But this is just a personal preference, and I actually give the restaurant kudos for being generous.  \n\nIf you're in Mandalay Bay anyway, you wouldn't go wrong having dinner here.  But I wouldn't go out of the way to come here."

The wine tower in the middle of the restaurant is a four story temperature controlled wine tower, with flying wine angels. \nFor a restaurant that has been recognized as a AAA Four Diamond Restaurant and epicurious.com top restaurants from 1995 to 2010 , I was extremely disappointed with the service. Our waiter never introduced his name nor came back in a timely manner to see if we would like to start on any appetizers before our main entree. By the time our waiter ,by, the name of Abdaljalil ( asked for his name from another server walking by) came by to take my drink order.. i was ready to order my whole meal for the evening. \n\nI ordered a glass of wine to enjoy with my sirloin sliders with guacamole and chipotle sauce and a plate of artisaal cheese and house accompaniments, sliders were perfectly cooked and prepared. \n\nFor the main entree I ordered 2 bone in rib eye with the garlic firecracker and classic bearnaise sauce accompany with some Parmesan fries and buttered asparagus. \n\nWhen ordering our main entree, I asked our waiter Abdaljalil if he could slice the rib eye in pieces for us, he responded No. So i left it as that. \n\nAs our servers Dario and Ricardo were extremely tentative with refilling our water and constantly asking us what was needed, they even offered if i would like the bone in rib eye sliced in the back to make it easier for sharing. First, I already asked our waiter prior to ordering, so i was a bit confused with they offered to take it back to the kitchen. Our waiter Abdaljalil pulled Dario and Ricardo behind our booth and was saying something for quite a while, somehow Dario and Ricardo made my request happen! \n\nOur bone in rib eye was cooked to perfection, our sides was good but nothing to rave about. \n\nIn all honesty, i was disappointed with our Waiter.If we didn't have good servers like Dario and Ricardo, i would have rated this a 1. \n\nThe waiter did not even bring us our check,our servers did!!!!!!! \n\nI have dine at the Charlie Palmer in Orange County a lot, and that restaurant has never let me down. I was expecting the same type of service when dining at Aureole. \n\nI would probably attempt to dine at Aureole again and request for a different waiter, and hopefully get the same servers and better experience.Hopefully i can revised this review when i revisit the restaurant for a second chance."

We got to meet the wine angel that pulled our wine for us, which was a treat for the guys at our table.\n\nThe food was uneven.  Some of the dishes were stellar, worthy of lots of praise and just wonderful to eat. Others were just okay.  Nothing was bad, per se.  The bread options were amazing, and if you aren't Kosher, you MUST try to bacon roll.  We did the tasting menu, as one of the people in our group had a good night at the tables.  Note: you may need a good night at the tables to pay for it, but if you love food and the pomp around food, it may be worth it for you.  We were a fairly chatty crew, and we did not feel out of place, but a quiet elegant dinner would be equally possible there as well.\n\nWhy isn't it 5 stars? The uneven-ness of quality of food definitely was a detractor. I also find it odd to have different prices for the same meal depending upon where you sit in the building.  Finally, the prices were quite steep, though I give massive kudos for the wine list, which could serve just about any budget."

I loved the exterior decor and what little I could peek into the interior. Five years in the making and finally I got to eat here.\n\nSigh. Maybe I hyped it too much myself? It was, after all, a one Michelin star recipient. What went wrong? \n\nWell, for the most part although my meal didn't taste bad, it didn't taste particularly great. It wasn't fantastic. For the prices, it was only alright and not something I'd pay for next time. Most of their dishes were un-inspired and lacked the glistening luster of a one Michelin star place. The service was too casual to be consistent in my book and what kind of decent restaurant like this as DRY limes? \n\nThey also don't ask you before re-filling your sparkling water, what if I didn't want to pay for another bottle?\n\nThe only dish that saved this meal from a complete lackluster of goodness was their daily inspirational preparation of foie gras. It was truly delicious with the sweet pudding bread that they paired it with. My chicken liver pate was almost tasteless which was very unexpected of pate, and my salmon dish was overcooked, dry and lacked any salmon flavor whatsoever. I even offered it to the rest of the table to share and they all agreed that it didn't taste like salmon at all. Their black cod was alright but then again ... cod as a fish is delicious and difficult to mess up to begin with. I was especially disappointed that although they had a fantastic wine selection that some top names other restaurants had were non-existent in their vast towering cellar of wines. What's the point if you're just going to stock it with 100 bottles of the same wine with no room for others?\n\nOverall, it wasn't worth the money and I don't see how it was worth the Michelin star."

It is no wonder why, with every one of my visits to Las Vegas, NV, I make it a point to visit Aureole. \n\nMr. Mainini's staff didn't just make sure we had a great dinner, they were constantly (in a kind, professional - not overbearing manner) making sure that an experience was taking place. \n\nI've visited this establishment for business and pleasure dining and each time, my expectations have been met and exceeded.\n\nThe staff's timing between courses, the freedom and comfort of quietly checking in without interrupting conversation, the artistic presentation of the chef's delicious preparations will not only impress, but will keep you looking forward to more.\n\nHere's a neat tip: ask for a tour of the establishment. The staff will be elated to walk you through. There are some neat facts to learn about the place hat you'll remember. It was nicely and thoughtfully designed and knowing the details will give you a greater appreciation for what goes on behind the scenes.\n\nDinner with swans? The swan lake feature is regal and relaxing. Step outside with your drink and take it in between courses. Look up to the top left of that area at night to see the brilliant MANDALAY BAY moniker on the building's edge. It's a pretty sight adding to the experience.\n\nEven the details inside the elevator (the decor)... you won't pay much attention to it on he way in. When departing, after you've slowed the Las Vegas adrenaline pace with a pleasurable experience at Aureole, you will literally stop  & \"smell the rose\" that is on display. \n\nAureole is a must have experience. Try it and you will be back when you stroll into Vegas next time."

He was very enthusiastic about allowing our table of 3 taste any wine we desired. And the \"taste\" was more like a glass too. i got to try wines from Argentina, California, Austria, Spain... It was great!\nHe warned me that the entrees are not the best deal here, so instead I got 3 appetizers: the tuna canneloni, the louis salad, and the rock shrimp ravioli. All were executed PERFECTLY, both in taste and presentation.\nI originally ordered the squab on risotto, which was not at all what i expected. It was very rare, VERY gamey tasting, and had no skin. I sent it back with no problem and got the louis salad instead, which was 80% crab - YUM, my kind of salad.\nI got the opportunity to meet the chef and see the kitchen here, who was very gracious, even though I had criticized his squab. Seeing the kitchen was AWESOME. It is huge and there is staff everywhere. Very clean too.\nI would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking to have a memorable experience, especially if you love wine as much as I do! The restaurant is beautiful, the wine tower is impressive, and the service is impeccable. It was the BEST SERVICE I had in Vegas all week, and I went to a lot of other high end restaurants. However, be prepared to spend some money here! Including a generous tip, 3 appetizers and a glass of wine was $90."

Can' think of any reason not coming here.\n\nThe only complaint I have is our wait staff took us straight to the \"downstairs\" seats, which requires to order from their set menu (it's $20 more than the upstairs seats). When I found out about it, I requested to be seated at the \"upstairs\" table (which allows me to order from regular menu or set menu for $20 less). Our stupid server wouldn't want us to leave his table, and I believe it's most likely because he didn't want to lose his chance for making tips. Yikes. I had to ask 3 times, and finally kinda yelled at him to make him give up on us and take us to the regular seating area. It's unfortunate for a Michelin starred restaurant."

We didn't need table service for that, so we headed into the lounge and, as directed, chose our own seating.\n\nGrabbing a high top along the wall, we took our seats and looked around, having enjoyed the walk down around the wine tower, and generally getting our bearings on the ambiance and decor.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes, we finally got some eye contact and some menus. The waiter all but dropped them and walked away had my sis not asked immediately for water glasses.\n\nAfter almost 10 minutes, we flagged someone else down, explained that our waiter had not been back in some time, reiterated our request for water, and asked to place our order. While waiting, we saw a dessert sampler served to the table next to us and decided to give it a go.\n\nThe fizzy stuff came out in good time, we had a toast, and we waited, chatted, and lamented the fact that we would, in all probability, explode before the evening was out (see previous review of STRIPSTEAK ;)).\n\nThe dessert came out and we were not disappointed (nor did we care about our impending food-induced doomsday). The molten lava cake was melt-in-your-mouth perfect, the brownie and mousse had a bit of a spicy kick to it and was, overall, amazing. The strawberry shortcake was bland and a bit on the dry side, and the creme brulee was too soft (probably a result of too small a serving, the crisping of the crust alone would melt the tiny bit of creme in the dish).\n\nThe original waiter came by and asked if we were finished. We assured him we were, he nodded, and then... he left. He left everything on the table and just left. When he returned (almost 10 minutes later?) he asked again if we were finished and if we'd like the check. We again answered in the affirmative and he disappeared only to return with the bill; someone else finally came and cleared the table.\n\n$40 for a dessert sampler and two glasses of bubbly enjoyed in the bar/lounge. That didn't bother me as much as the inattentive, slow, and inefficient service. \n\nI am hoping a dinner experience will change my mind about this place, but I am in no real hurry to return after that."

You got the brunello?  Great. Yeah, can you turn around and wave please?\" She does.  How cool is that???  How many places can they do that in?  Not many.  Only at Aureole.

Me and my GFs came here for a special occassion dinner and majority of people left disappointed and probably still slightly hungry. \n\nWe started with bread which was not warm and seemed a little stale. For the price point and quality that this place is supposed to be at, I expect fresh baked bread. \n\nNext were appetizers which was a 50/50 hit and miss. French onion soup was good, it had little pieces of foie in the broth, they do like a puff pastry crust and the cheese is on top of the pastry so it's more like a cheese shell, you don't get the melty gooey cheese in the soup. Seared foie gras was very good, it was two nicely portioned pieces of foie. Octopus salad was not good. It has no flavor at all, not on the octopus or the accompaniments that came with the dish. Not even enough olive oil to hide the dryness of the octopus. My friend ended up sending hers back, I really wanted to send mine back too but since I was sharing with another person we did eat a good amount of it already so decided to just pay for that poor appetizer choice.\n\nMy entree ws pretty good. I got the branzino. It's skin was crisped nicely and the fish perfectly cooked and seasoned. I felt bad for the rest of the table because I don't think anyone else liked their entree. This was definitely a downer. Also our waiter didn't seem to care too much when we said the octopus was not to our liking. He did take it back, but reluctantly. \n\nConsidering how disappointing the food was and the service was just OK, I would not come back."

Not only do you have a view of the fountain with swans swimming in it (I was skeptical that they were real, but they were!), but you have access to a private patio. While waiting for your meal you can enjoy your drinks comfortably outside or even lounge for a few cocktails after you meal. That is the absolutely perfect dining experience in my opinion. \n\nAs mentioned, I am not a food critic by any means so I'm not even going to try to tackle describing what we ate - it's that good. Please, just take my word for it, you will have an amazing experience and an amazing meal here. Aureole does not disappoint.\n\nOn a side note, my father-in-law must eat gluten free.

And, usually, I am not disappointed with the offerings the many celebrity chefs have put such great effort to create.  However, after being disappointed on numerous occasions when visiting this restaurant, I feel compelled to write about it. This last experience was just last night.  After a concert at HOB, three friends walked by Aureole's and saw a sign on an easel that read something like:  Happy Hour (hours) Try our Sommelier selections of wine, and our specialty drinks.\"  So, we descend to the bar level and ask about the sommelier selections available for Happy Hour.  The waiter brings a bottle of Pinot Noir from \"California.\"  Not Napa, Sonoma, Paso, Santa Barbara, or Watts, for that matter.  It was simply from \"California.\"  We look it up on our smartphones and find that sells for $6.99.  We turn it down and instead, I order a glass of sparkling.  My friend orders a scotch and water.  The sparkling tasted like it was left in a cooler with a plate of cold cuts and cheeses.  It smelled awful and tasted awful.  My friend, who ordered a scotch and water got a tall glass of water that tasted like ... water.  It was so watered down.  It seems to me that a \"sommelier selection\" should do more than leave a bad taste in one's mouth.  Was this guy passing off a bad decision to buy a bad wine on his guests as a Happy Hour?  And, any bartender who serves a scotch and water the way this was served should be horsewhipped!  Used to be that restaurant specials were meant to highlight the wonderful capabilities of the chef and staff..  Nowadays, it seems specials are simply used to clear out the fridge of bad decisions. And, after having written this review, I have to say that Charlie Palmer is a great chef.  He has proven it time and time again.  However, there is a theory that states:  \"The whole is only as good as the sum of it's parts.\"  This theory fits my experience at Aureole's.  There are too many negatives to call this restaurant a positive."

Of course, our food was great, delicious and beautifully plated as one would expect, but what really made this meal was the exceptional service we received from everyone we encountered.\n\nI drink my fair share of good wine, but I'll admit to being a little intimidated by the concept of \"sommelier.\" I got over this quickly after meeting Adam, our sommelier for the evening.  His friendliness, affability, and unpretentiousness really added to our enjoyment of the evening.  It didn't hurt that he was pouring exceptionally good wines by the glass, and kept us tasting wines that we never would have ordered on our own and really ended up enjoying.  Even if you don't order a bottle, make sure to check out the extensive wine list, presented on a tablet PC and sortable by varietal, region, vintage, etc.  Very cool.\n\nI started with a Caesar salad and my wife with a baby fields greens salad.  Both were excellent, although I'd have to say that mine was a bit prettier.  I ordered a loup de mer and my wife had a dish featuring smoked sturgeon and scallops.  I'd say she was the winner of the entree contest, with mine being slightly overcooked.  I was happy nonetheless, as the accompanying flavors and the terrific wine more than balanced any deficiencies in the dish's preparation.\n\nWe finished with a dynamite warm lava mocha cake and some small complementary truffles.  And of course a nice ice wine for our liquid desert.\n\nBernard, the dining room manager, has brought his years of experience at Spago to Aureole, and it shows.  Nice work, everyone!

PLEASE open back up for Sundays!!! Very unfortunate. There were no signs or postings anywhere about this closure. Meanwhile in the 45 minutes we were in this area of the hotel, there was about 50 people who walked up to the restaurant to see if it was open and some actually waited for a host to come out to seat them...unfortunately no one ever came to the front for the customers. My fiance eventually went to another restaurant asking what is going on and they explained to us Aureole was closed Sundays now because of slow business.  Will be sending family and friends to other hotels for fine dining until we find out it is open on Sundays again."

When I think of impeccable tableside service, ambiance, and food quality, it's difficult to beat what happened at Aureole. Continue reading about my magical adventure below...\n\n8:15pm, Saturday night, dinner reservations for 6. We're seated immediately next to our own personal patio with lounge chairs, a fountain, and a swan. Yes, a mother f-ing swan. Alfredo was our attentive waiter for the evening, and we also had a great sommelier. They explained the courses and specials very well and made sure we had enough time to decide and continue our fine dining experience. This man was a professional. Sure, the bottles of Fiji water were $9/bottle, and our drinks were pricey ($8 - $whatever/bottle of beer or wine), but never were we ever wanting for anything, and Alfredo always knew how to time our plates with conversation, extra bread, or exceptional information. Appetizers included the crudo, octopus salad (tender, succulent grilled seafood here), and special-of-the-night gnocchi. Soft pillows of dough and perfectly cooked vegetables awaited me, alongside a thick, but no heavy white sauce. Perfectly seared ahi tuna steaks and divers scallops came next, and a wonderfully light, but perfectly burnt creme brulee finished off the night. Did I mention there is a gigantic wine tower at the front for you to gaze at while you walk down the stairs to your seats?\n\nPoints to note - the aged steak is fantastic (you will not get a poorly timed or cooked meal here), the sauteed mushrooms and pommes puree are absolutely a combo you must put together as two sides, and adding a lobster tail to your meal never hurts. If you are going for the 38oz house-special steak, you should definitely split it with someone else. The fact that they cut off the bone and leave it for you on the side is just ridiculous attention to detail. Even when you walk away (and move to your amazing personal patio), people will quickly come around to change your dishes and cutlery and refold your table napkin. This is true fine dining. Remember to make it worth it and dress to the nines!"

However, we did not order wine, but the huge wine tower was cool. The lovely ladies of Aureole would be hoisted up by some sort of pulley system to reach the wines. \n\nWe got there around 6:30PM and were told by the hostess that the next available table would be open at 8:30PM! So be aware, make reservations if you want to eat here. However, they did have open bar seating which you could order off the whole menu, so we went there instead.\nWe ended up sitting at a booth and there happened to be happy hour (even on a Saturday!) until 7PM that night. I tried the Watermelon Gazpacho, sliders, and a fish dish (I can no longer recall... because... Vegas).\n\nThe sliders were very cute and delicious, but I was not a fan of the Watermelon Gazpacho. Perhaps it's because I'm not a fan of watermelon in general, but I just thought it was too cold and hard to eat (it came with one giant cracker). \n\nI believe I ate some kind of Ahi Tuna dish which was pretty delicious, the fish was seared rare and of good quality. \n\nI really liked the environment of the restaurant, I think you have to dress business casual for this place, but it was hard to tell given that I went the weekend before Halloween\n.  \nAs expected of Vegas, this place is not cheap. However, I cannot exactly recall the prices because... Vegas... Let's just say I had a couple of cocktails during (ok and before) dinner. Perhaps this was not my most cognizant review, but I had an overall impression of the restaurant and it was good!"

I made a reservation on OpenTable and in the comments I requested seating in the Swan Court.  When I arrived, there was a large group near that area.  I was seated in the main dining room with a wonderful view of the wine tower.\n\nShortly after being seated, the assistant general manager came over and apologized for the inability to seat me in the Swan Court as they were having several groups that evening.  I asked him about getting some photos of the outside, and he took me then while there was still some good daylight.  He unlocked the door and we went to the patio and I got some shots.  On the way back to the table, he gave me his business card for future reservations or help, and he had a liter bottle of S. Pellegrino brought to my table.  \n\nOn to the food.  I got the Parallel Tasting menu.  I'm going to use the descriptions from the menu because I could not have typed them all into my iPhone without being there for hours.\n\nCourse One was called the tomato course.  One plate had Textures of Tomato, light seared langoustine, and Ajo Blanco.  The parallel plate had Tesroa Tomato Confit, basil pearls, and aged balsamic brittle.\n\nCourse Two was the corn course.  One plate had summer corn Agnolotti, velout\u00e9, orels and fava beans, and popcorn shoots.  The parallel plate had Ruby Red Corn culantro, a Diver scallop, and Guanciale. \n\nCourse Three was the veal course.  One plate had veal tenderloin, Australian winter truffles, porcini lasagna, and truffle vinaigrette. The parallel plate had veal sweet breads, curried cauliflower and champagne grape slices, and Budha hand citrus.\n\nCourse Four was the coconut course.  One plate had coconut scented cheesecake, Malibu rum caramel, and Lychee sorbet.  The parallel plate had coconut rice pudding, mango sorbet, and fennel crisp.  With the coconut course, I was brought a small plate with four petit fours or mignardises.  When I polished all of that off, my server brought me 3 hand made chocolate truffles.  \n\nThe food was great!  I really enjoyed the idea of the parallel plates with two takes on a given food.  Corn two ways, coconut a couple of ways, tomato, and of course the wonderful veal.\n\nService was exemplary.  My server, Russell, was always nearby for anything I needed without hovering.  We found out that we live not too far from each other and I showed him on Yelp the new location he can buy Bon Breads in our neighborhood.  Yea, Yelp!  The numerous bus people were all quite efficient at clearing dishes, refilling my water glass, or whatever was needed.  The staff passed my twisted artificial sweetener pack test with flying colors.  It was removed in about 8 seconds.\n\nI really like the layout of the restaurant and if I couldn't sit in the Swan Court, I was glad to be where I was.  I am fascinated by that wine tower and I watched one of the wine angels ascend several times to get wine for a table.  This was a memorable dining experience and I will be back.  Hold the swans--I'll be there.\n\nEdit:  I have to add that the staff let me \"play\" with one of their iPads from which you can order wines or cocktails.  I sent myself an email from the iPad describing the cocktail I didn't have but I just tried it out.  It's a neat way of remembering the wine you had without having to use your memory if you email yourself.  Too bad it's a dedicated iPad.  I think I could have hidden it under my jacket.  ;-)"

You really can't go wrong with sitting by the four story wine rack to watch the wine angels, but choosing a table at the back to watch the fountains is fantastic as well.  The service here was top notch, and so was the food. I ordered the main lobster and fettuccine pasta and it was incredible. My boyfriend had the 8 oz. filet which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We are from Kansas City, so it can be hard to impress us with a steak anywhere else, but this place accomplished it! For sides, we order potato noisette and brussel sprouts and shared them both, they both were delicious and well done. The wine list here is extensive, so you may want to go with at least an idea of what kind of wine you would like to order for the evening. The ice cream and sorbet dessert assortment was fresh, unique and well put together. Overall, this is a place we will likely visit each time we come to Vegas. If you are on the fence, give it a try-you won't be disappointed!"

The restaurant sits inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel which is one of the more classy of the LV Strip Hotels and the quality of the restaurant lives up to the hotels reputation. \n\nYou enter from the Casino floor but to get to the restaurant area needs an elevator ride to a lower floor. However, from the top of the elevator you get to see the Wine Tower which the restaurant is famed for. More of that later.\n\nI went for the Christmas Menu paired with wines which came in at about $160 so this isn't cheap but you are paying for what you get which is quality food and quality service. Everything was just right with the waiters not being too intrusive but close enough so you knew exactly what was being served and what the wines were.\n\nDuring the meal we had asked if the waiter could tell us when the Wine Angels would be flying and he reassured us that as we were leaving we would get to see a demo flight. The wall of wine that encompasses two floors is reached by the wine angel by hoisting her high into the sky to obtain your chosen bottle - it's a sight to be seen!\n\nIf the rest of the strip seems a little cheap and tacky then head into Aureole and experience the finest of fine dining."

Totally out of character for a fine restaurant IMHO.  Felt much more Applebees than what you'd expect from a Charlie Palmer restaurant.\n\nDrinks and appetizers were excellent, as well as service--at the beginning.  More later.  My date ordered a tasting menu, and I ordered the Niman Ranch pork chop.\n\nMy pork chop was disappointing.  It arrived sliced on a bed of chard and deep fried pig ears.  (I'm not grossed out by the pig ear concept, but their crunchiness annoyed me more than accent the flavor or texture of the chard.)  My chop was terribly dry near the bone and at the other end.  I simply can't figure out how they cooked it to have shoe leather quality meat at each end and appropriate juiciness in the center.  That said--even for the center--the meat had too much fat for a chop.  I prefer a solid, juicy, whole chop--not this presentation.\n\nMy date's main course had to be returned....with me eating in solitude....due to the kitchen ignoring allergy warnings.  The restaurant promptly addressed it, but this definitely takes the shine off a special occasion dinner.\n\nService:  A large party was seated nearby during our meal, and our waiter tended to them.  The problem this created was a LONG delay in my date's final course from the tasting menu.  So, the cadence was noticeably off.\n\nI was finally offered a dessert menu whose pages were stained in several places from drink spills, etc.  This is off-putting and not projecting the image I'd suspect Mr. Palmer would want.  One of the stained pages was an advertisement to buy Charlie's books.  The irony wasn't lost on me."

I called down earlier in the day, explained our 'family situation'...and they gave us a little table off to the side, away from the other guests.  So my wife was able to nurse the little guy without making a 'scene' in the restaurant.  Big props to them for that!!\n\nAnd the waiters were magnificent.  I'm sure it's a tough business to be in, especially in this down economy...but they were just the right amount 'friendly' while still leaving you to enjoy your nice dinner.  They even brought us out some extra dessert for our anniversary.  Another big props for that as well!\n\nWe decided to both go with the 3-course Prix Fixe meals @ $65/person.  We both got different items so we could sample the foods.  Overall, the food was great.  But sets of Appetizers and Desserts were simply wonderful.  And my beef sirloin was absolutely perfect as well.  The one 'weak' link of the 7 items we tried was the halibut main course dish.  It was certainly not bad...but it didn't really grab you like a main course of a $65 3-course meal should.  Perhaps we were still thinking about the halibut we had at Rick Moonen's RM place that same day for lunch, which simply had more interesting flavors to go with it AND at a significantly cheaper price tag.\n\nThe Gin and Tonic was as good as I've had in a long time!!  Very nice.\n\nIf it weren't for that one halibut dish, I could easily give Aureole all 5-stars....because everything else was just about perfect.  The bottom line is that when I pay $65 for a 3-course meal, my level of expectation is very high.  No room for error!  And unfortunately for us, the halibut just wasn't quite up to snuff.\n\nTIP:  Aureole is one of the few Michelin-rated restaurants that will let you bring Restaurant.com coupons.  Considering our total bill was $170 before tip, it was nice to buy a $50 voucher for $4 through Restaurant.com....for a net savings of about 25% of our total bill."

It's located right by the restaurant row of the Mandalay Bay, right across the Japanese Restaurant Kumi.\n\nIt's in the lower level so either you need to take the elevator or walk down by the two-story glass enclosed wine cellar which the harness mounted wine tenders go up and down to get your bottle while tourists take photos.\n\nMenu is somewhat similar to the New York location with a good choice of seafood and meat dishes. No matter what your liking us you will find a dish but somewhat on the pricey side. \n\nThere are bar seating, main dining room and also outdoor seating if you feel like it.\n\nWine list seems a lot more approachable than the New York location. Wines by the bottle from low $50s to four digits, if you have been winning big at the casino floor.\n\nService was excellent for our party of nine people with strict restrictions.\n\nEnjoy!"

But, since we were in Vegas, and didn't feel like dining with the masses from Des Moines, we thought we'd have some fun and have a nice dinner to celebrate a great 2006. The PC tablet for the wine list is great in theory, but also sort of gimmicky, and we felt that ultimately the 10,000+ bottle wine selection was a bit overwhelming. Although the sommelier was helpful in narrowing down the choices, it definitely helped to have some knowledge of wine going in.  As for the meal itself, again, good, but not great. Nothing really jumps out at me as being a standout, and I can't even recall what I ate at this point. Contrast this to some of my 5-star restaurant experiences, and I can remember every last detail. Finally, but service seemed a bit schizo... we had at least three different waiters, all of whom would show up randomly throughout the meal. So... to sum it up, if you're looking for a unique dining experience in Vegas and love wine, then definitely try Aureole. Just make sure you kick ass at the tables beforehand, otherwise it's kind of a waste of $$."

I was there on business but my husband joined me to combine a little bit of pleasure with the business.  I was really looking forward to Aureole after hearing so much about it.  I will start by saying our food was fabulous and that is of course the most important aspect of any restaurant experience.  Service was also very good.  My pomegranate martini was one of the best that I have ever had.  What was a little disappointing was the stark nature of the restaurant.  I think one problem is that  due to the 3 hour time difference from the east coast, we were there early by Vegas standards, around 6 pm  Wall are all white with no artwork or anything to speak of.  Maybe when it is dark the wine tower takes center stage but in the bright light it was really not as impressive as others have stated and we really only saw one flight up the tower during our entire meal.  I was also a bit shocked to see what appeared to be a curtained area used for waiters etc to serve from.  It just appeared kind of flimsy, like something you would see at a large banquet hall.  It was one of those rare dining experiences where the lack of ambiance took away from an otherwise great meal and if anything I had expected the opposite situation."

Let me get this straight; I get INVITED to dinner because of a bad experience previously where I paid full price. Graciously, I accept. We are offered a domestic Champagne when we are seated which we refuse. Their wine list is so over inflated that,though we are limited to what we can order, we get a very good wine, Egelhoff (never heard of it either) cabernet. It's priced @ $150. Rest of the meal we order as we always do,same as the wine. I figure the meal costs about @250-350 with the wine. Thus, $100 is a  30 to 40% tip. I thought it was a good tip. How about you. Trouble with this place, with its excellent chef is it has absolutely no class. Imagine turning a customer off after trying to win him back.\n\nOh yes; the reason for this review is that I wrote twice to thank the manager I was never favored with a reply."

We had 12 and a baby and crammed into a round table. The wait staff were constantly reaching over us to fill water or bread. Very tacky when trying to eat and constantly having an arm in your face. That was only the beginning of the nightmare. \n\nLet's get to the food I had the seared scallops which were delicious the petite filet mignon which was cooked to perfection accompanied by the blue cheese sauce. My wife had the sea bass which was blissful with every bite. Dessert was one of the most amazing creme brulee I've ever had. Now back to the nightmare which was my 40th birthday celebration. Prior to ordering we asked for seperate checks, we were told no problem. We also informed the waiter we had a wine paring coupon he said that once we ordered someone would help with the pairing. Then the manager came over and said this would not be happening and to just order wine and they would subtract the price of our vouchers. Not what I paid for but ok. \n\nHere is where it gets really bad. Check comes not separated. So we ask for seperate checks again. They are brought out one by one. At this point we've spent 4 hours in this place one and a half of that time was waiting for checks. I'm last to get my check and it is wrong. Then they could not figure out how to take off my pairing which was really not a pairing. So here I am trying to celebrate and these people couldn't figure their stuff out. Then they were claiming someone didn't pay and could we track them down since not everyone wanted to sit at a cramped table any longer. Finally had to write everything down by hand of what we had and they rang us up and checked us out. Worst experience ever. \n\nOh and the wine fairies they were cool."

Everybody must see these \"wine angels\" retrieve wine (they sway around and up/down on a spelunking cord!).  This is a good place to go to when you're in Vegas just to say you did something fancy.  My bf and I were in town for his b-day.  There is a PC tablet that you order wine bottles from, which I thought was unnecessary to go electronic versus a paper menu, but it does make sorting wine by type and price, fast.  Just for fun, we wanted to see what the highest priced wine bottle was, and I believe it was in the $thousands!  The service was great; perhaps a little too overbearing, as the waiter was constantly checking up on us every 5 minutes, it felt like.  My bf and I ordered from the $75 3-course prix-fixe menu (I believe there is a $95 7-course menu too), and the water gave us an extra dessert with a candle for his b-day.  Food portions were average.  My main entree was the salmon, and my bf's was one of the steaks, and his steak totally trumped my salmon.  It has an overall romantic and classy atmosphere.  You will feel underdressed in anything less than a skirt or slacks."

My standards for a 5 star dining place are really high - I expect the best when I'm shelling out big bucks! \n\nWe were drawn to Aureole by a $50 GC from restaurant.com and an $85 valentines day weekend 5 course menu. The menu *sounded* good and we'd never tried Aureole so figured it was a great time to give it a go. \n\nI think I read the word \"Corporate\" in someone else's review in describing the atmosphere. It was pretty, but it felt like a nice hotel in Sweden or something to me. It was cold, austere, modern, but not in a \"cool\" sense. Just kinda blah.\n\nThe wine angel and wine tablet were freaking cool. I was however disappointed by their insane prices (only 3 red wines in the entire book under $50 that I could find!) and every wine I wanted to drink (favorites from Napa/Italy) weren't in there. So much for their huge wine list. We did try a $60 or so bottle from Italy and were happy, however.\n\nAnyways, if you're still with me.. here's the food!\n\n*Caviar/Smoked Salmon: So incredibly blah and boring. I love smoked salmon but this fell flat. I had a better smoked salmon appetizer at a wedding I was at recently - sad.\n\n*Short Rib Ravioli with Foie Gras - This was divine and saved the meal from being one of the most boring meals I've had in a long time.\n\n*Dover Sole - bland and tasteless. I took 2 bites and quit eating it. \n\n*Beef Wellington - I do love me some Beef Wellington but this was one of the worst I've had. Not particularly flavorful and didn't compare to Chef's Palette in Henderson. \n\n*Dessert - lots of sorbet, some raspberry parfait thing, some icky coffee flavored \"tart\". Nothing to write home about. \n\nOverall I was pretty disappointed by this pricey dinner. None of the food was awful, but it was so freaking boring and bland I felt like I was eating cruise line food or catered food. There weren't those special touches you get at Alex (amuse bouche platter, special desserts,etc) and for $40 more per person I wish I had spent my money there instead! \n\nFor the record I also was pretty disappointed by Charlie Palmer Steak in the Four Seasons. Maybe his NYC outposts are good, but his Vegas restaurants could really use some work!"

Each dish was so unique, beautifully presented and tasty beyond belief. \n\nOn our most recent trip to Vegas we wanted to eat at as many great places as possible. I love to plan out all my culinary stops and make reservations weeks before.  On this particular night we were seeing the AFI show (my favorite punk rock turned slightly sell out band) so we had some issues with time. Besides Aureole having the earliest opening time, they were conveniently located near the House of Blues (AFI) at Mandalay.  So, in hopes of another fabulous meal...\n\nThis time hubby and I ordered a la carte (time constraints). We shared a couple of tapas style small bites and then ordered entrees. We skipped dessert. Everything was very good but nothing was as stand out as the tasting menu enjoyed prior to this visit. Everything was still far better than our dinner the prior evening at Michael Mina (hubby will disagree with me there). \n\nAureole's wine list is excellent. It could take you half the evening to make a selection if you didn't know what you were looking for or didn't ask for help. The service is really good. The restaurant itself is beautiful. With the wine cellar as the focal point, the main dining area is wide open with high ceilings. The decor is contemporary but the lighting is dim and very romantic.  I wish they had more bathrooms (they have a one-person ladies room) without having to leave the restaurant itself. \n\nMy only real complaint echoes a fellow yelper's review. I think having a photographer make the rounds and take pictures of guests is kind of uncool, unclassy and commercial feeling. I felt interrupted and obliged to have my picture taken. The results I would liken to a slightly fuzzy prom picture.  It brought the ambiance of the place down and maybe if enough people yelp about it management will put an end to it. \n\nIn all, a good evening. We will be back in the future but without a doubt we will take the time to do the tasting menu."

The restaurant was barely 1/2 full when we arrived.  We were presented with only the Restaurant Week menu and we had to mention the wine paring option.  Loved the way the server told us that he would honor it because we knew about it.  First he denied it and then he would honor it.  Whatever!  The food was good but a bit too much going on.  I had the braised octopus and lobster salad.  There were fingerling potatoes, a toasted piece of bread, eggplant, hearts of palm, the octopus, lobster, and some greens on this thing.  Pick it apart and it was excellent.  Everything tasted great.  Put it all together and you have a huge bite going on but it was too much!   Same thing with the entree.  I had the short rib with ahi tuna.  There was a gnochhi pieces (very good!!) and pureed broccolli on the plate too.  Again, each thing by itself was amazing!  Then I had the peach tart for dessert.  I was expecting more of a flaky crust.  This was more of a bread crust.  Good, but I prefer flaky crust.  My friend had the chocolate dessert and it was very rich.  Rich but very good, I just can't imagine finishing the whole thing by myself.  I would go into chocolate overload!!  Wine parings were good but the dessert wine was a bit much for my taste.  \n\nService was okay...kinda snooty."

From the awesome wine tower that requires a circus act to reach many of the bottles, to the ambiance, and of course the fabulous food - most amazing.\n\nWe were lucky to be in Vegas during Restaurant Week so every dining establishment offered special prix fixe menus for $50 so we took advantage of that. The appetizer selection said \"choose two per person\" but we figured, no way ... but indeed, it was true. They weren't small plates either -- the appetizers alone (we had the hoisin-style calamari, ceviche, steak and naan, and artichoke dip) filled us up with goodness. But we had to get through two regular-sized main entrees (I had the porcini and artichoke ravioli with a goat cheese foam and kale) and totally forgot they came with sides until those were set a few minutes later -- yeesh. \n\nOh, and a quartet of desserts to end with -- what can I say? Top it off with impeccable service, and you have quite the winner. \n\nThe only \"complaint\" I have (and I don't know if it even falls as one) is that the waiter assured us these plates were small since, after all, it is a tasting menu -- and as I said, if those were tasting plates, they must've been from Green Giant land. I get full thinking about this meal."

The price structure is a gimmick. I have no problem paying for great food. But the prices are set flat per person for three courses. Which means for $85 you can get the lobster ravioli, followed by the filet, followed Chocolate cake. And for the same $85 price your partner can get the ceasar salad, followed by chicken, followed by carrot cake. No matter how  you plate it or where you get your romaine/chicken/carrpts from the prices should be significantly different based on the ingredients. So if you want a menu that you can pick what you want and have the price reflect what you got, go somewhere else. However, if everyone in your party plans on having a really heavy meal than check this place out because the atmosphere and food was awesome. \n\nwould have been 5 stars if the price structure made sense."

The shared plate arrived with the appetizers (bad!) but the rest of the service was smooth. Our captain sent along a sorbet plate and after dinner sweets. \nWhile we were offered drinks quickly, we passed for a nice bottle of wine. It took ages before we were able to get menus to see what we wanted to complement. The sommelier was friendly and gave a demo of the tablet pc listings but we made our own choice and only saw him one more time.\nFor the chef I'd say forget the oscar part of the tenderloin (4 little pieces of crab and 3 long slices of asparagus) - it added nothing to one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. The peppered lamb with the red pepper coulis was great with the wine. The foie gras was ok - the table beside us had a tasting menu and got a better portion of it than I did as an a la carte diner. Also it was a bit overcooked and the veins hadn't been removed.\nI wouldn't hurry back but I would go again. \n(We had a reservation and arrived on time but were directed to sit opposite the entry. It wasn't crowded and there were staff around who could have seated us immediately. Do they think waiting leads you to think it's a better restaurant?)"

Given that it was dark outside, this felt like a particularly stupid feature.\n\nI asked if it was possible to split a wine pairing, and was quickly rebuked.  I've asked for that and had no problems in many other places.  Oh well.\n\nThe dinner started with a trio of amuses.  One of them was a bacon-wrapped scallop that was okay.  I don't remember the others.  The bacon they served with the beef was the most amazing I've ever had.  Incredibly crisp, but not overcooked.  The server was happy to explain the vast effort they go to make it, curing it themselves, cooking it low and slow between sheets of some absorbing paper that gets rid of the grease.  The duo of beef had some flat-iron that was dry and completely over-done, which was odd.\n\nDessert was okay; they brought a trio of sorbets and asked us to guess what they were.  We got two of them, but unsurprisingly pomegranate-cherry was a hard one.\n\nWe left feeling overly full but with none of the wonder we had when leaving L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, which was more expensive, but SO much better.  I won't come back here, and would suggest other places over this.  My brother came here a while ago and absolutely loved it, as he said service was great, which I definitely didn't get."

In general, the food is very good. I did the pre-fixe menu the 1st visit, and it was a while ago, so I don't remember what I had, but I remember liking it enough to come back. At that time, the server even brought me some extra goodies for free, so that was nice. \n\nThey are also on restaurant.com, so you can get a pretty good discount here. On my recent visit, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with duck confit. This was a very nice mix of flavors. The foie gras was also good, but I actually had better foie gras the night before at Stripsteak next door.  The cheese plate was good. I also had the salmon, which was good but not great. I definitely enjoyed the pre fixe menu I ordered on my 1st visit better than the choices I made on my most recent visit. So the take home message here is not to trust myself to know how to order properly :)  \n\nAlso, they bring an assortment of four breads at the beginning (including pretzel bread), but they are all served cold, which is not pleasing. Who likes cold bread better than warm bread? Plus, they seem very excited about their wine list and the \"wine angels\" on harnesses who go get your wines for you. I have a better idea... why not charge admission and strap the guest into the harness and he/she can go get his/her own wine. Dinner and a ride! \n\nI want to give them 3 stars for the most recent visit, but 4 stars for the initial visit. I guess I rounded up. The overall average rating of 3.5 stars is very accurate."

The menu itself did not have adequate description on what was really in the dish so it was up to our waiter to tell us. \n\nPrice: It was over priced for the food we actually got. I have had much better food and I personally feel I could probably cook better than what I actually got. The sauteed clams I got as an appetizer was actually pretty good. \n\nService: So this is my biggest annoyance about the place. I mean am I not paying the same as the person as the next person. \n\n1) I get the menu and couldn't decide between the Salmon and Ranch Raised Chicken. The server comes to me and I ask what he would suggest? his response \"everything on the menu is fresh and everything is good. The chicken is a ranch raised chicken.\" Really is that why on the menu it said RANCH RAISED and I would hope everything is fresh at the prices I am paying but that was not my question now was it? That is all he said so I just said well i guess I will go with the chicken. Still keeping a positive attitude. \n\n2) The food comes (not sure the name of this server but it was the bald guy) He did not say one word at all he threw the plate down in front of me and my husband. Grabbed my husbands empty beer bottle and was about to walk away. I said umm did you want another one to my husband? Still not saying a word he looked at my husband. So my husband says yes i will have another.. Ok at this point you would think he would actually SPEAK to us. Nope instead of asking me if I wanted anything he POINTED at me.. What the hell? WHy the hell do I want a persons finger in my face?! I said NO Thanks and laughed in his face because of his rudeness. As soon as he walked away my husband said what the HELL was that? who points at a person and is this person MUTE? \n\n3) You would think at some point someone would come fill my empty water glass because the person at the next table had their water filled and it was still half full. Nope my husband actually had to flag them down to get more water. Yes we had to flag them down because they did not bother to come over and at least ask how our meal was. \n\n4) As stated above they did not come over to even ask how I meal was. We finished our meal the waiter comes over and just says \"I see you are done with your meal want any dessert\" I ask for the dessert menu but honestly at that point I just wanted to get the hell out of there. \n\nWe still gave them at 20% tip because we always give at least 20%. Hey imagine what they would've got if they were actually nice to us? \n\nI am not sure if the reason they treated us different than the others was because we LOOKED young. Yes I said LOOKED because we are NOT young we are both just very lucky to still get carded. Or was it the fact that I was not drinking. Sorry i am not allowed to drink but you would think they would still treat you the same? I asked for a virgin pina colada but they do not make frozen drinks the only nonalcoholic drink they could offer me was OJ mixed with Pineapple juice.. NO thanks!"

You can request one of the booths near the back windows and it's like you're in the restaurant all by yourself! \n\nThe food is incredible and well worth the price. I'd highly recommend the meat - we had the lamb and the fillet mignon and both were incredible. We ordered a few sides: broccoli and rice and both were delicious and well sized to share. We shared the dessert sampler plate which was one of the best desserts I've ever had. We had a mix of chocolate and fruit and hot and cold dishes - all very yummy!\n\nThe wine list is the BEST PART. You get an ipad and you can read about your wine selections on the application the restaurant uses. If you really care about your wine sourcing, you can also go and watch the \"angels\" (women strung up to the ceiling of the vertical wine cellar) hand-pick your wine. Very cool.

Cutting to the end of the service, as he presented the bill he finally decided to smile and converse with us. Too late, buddy.\nMaybe it had something to do with the fact that we decided to order multiple appetizers rather than one main course each in order to sample as much of the fair as possible...who knows.\n\nThe food was ok but not stellar.

Frankly, I really don't remember what I ate.  Each plate was very well decorated with small portion.  The rack of lamb came in four or five slices of precut meat.  Some of the dishes were so well decorated that you can't tell what is the food you're eating.  The other reason is that lighting was too dark.  I like the French Onion soup the most.

I'm a big fan of Charlie Palmer family of restaurants; personally I think it's way better than Michael Mina. Since we had such a great experience at Aureole in New York City, I thought we should give it a second try for the real thing: dinner extravaganza. \n\nThe one thing that my bf pointed out to me while we're walking down to the reception area was that the restaurant has a \"wine angel\" who \"flies\" up and down the massive wine cellar. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the wine angel since we were seated in the area facing the swan pool (yes, there were swans and they were vicious). \n\nTwo things that really stood out during this 3-hour dining experience: our single super chatty and super nice sommelier from Santa Fee (let's call her \"Bertha\" because I don't remember her name; yes, I chose the name \"Bertha\" for a reason) and the incredible food. For those of you who know me, I don't drink alcohol except dessert wine in particular Muscato D'asti. Well, Miss Bertha here introduced me to my new favorite wine: Brochetta D'acqui. I was so digging the wine; I had two glasses (gasp!). At the end of dinner, she gave us two beautiful roses and two bags of the most delicious chocolate powder covered almonds you will have ever in your life. I certainly hope she finds a boyfriend soon because she really seemed like a great gal; lose a few pounds, a little make over (ok, a lot), and some M.A.C. touchup girlfriend can be quite a catch. Let's face it: physical attraction always starts with outer beauty. \n\nOk got a little sidetracked on Bertha. We had a five-course tasting dinner menu, and the one thing that really stuck in my head (to this day) was the beef wellington. It is THE BEST single dish I have ever had so far. The foie gras on top of the filet mignon wrapped in puffy pastry was literally heaven on earth. Unfortunately, this dish is not a permanent menu item. But if the restaurant happens to offer it, order it. You will want more; shoot, order two dishes and take one home. \n\nI give this restaurant a 5-star because overall it was probably the best dining experience I've ever had. Each course was presented beautifully and tasted amazing. The service was very attentive without being overbearing. We were able to take a break between courses, walk around the swan pool and feed the hungry and aggressive swans. One thing about all Charlie Palmer locations: awesome bread selection and you can totally stuff your face with as much carbs as you want. But even without the unlimited bread, Aureole will not let you down. It is a culinary journey that is worthy of your presence (and deep pocket)."

This was the big disappointment of the weekend. \n\nThe flavors were bland and not well presented, the waitstaff quiet or downright rude, the wait between courses up to 25 minutes and ... did I mention really mediocre food? I'd be ok with this food as airline food, but not a $95 a plate prix menu at supposedly one of the best restaurants in vegas. Blah. I sent an email to the manager... and surprise, didn't hear anything back. Whatever. All I can do is tell you to avoid this place.\n\nI probably eat out at a nice restaurant at least twice a month, possibly more.  I love food, and can forgive all the service mistakes and ambience issues you can throw at me, if I get good food.  \n\nI didn't get good food.  Sorely disappointed."

I kind of dug the pc wine tablet, but the battery died on our first one and wiped out our selections (making our NY sales rep rather cranky).  They quickly brought us another, but with all the options, we couldn't remember what we'd originally ordered.  The sommelier was quick to help us make new choices, and we were off!\n\nAmuse Bouche:  Sunchoke Soup - Delicious, but I thought it was kind of odd that they would bring a non veggie item for everyone to taste without announcing the vast amounts of bacon in it...  what if one of us had been a vegetarian??\n\nMy Choices:  To Start  - French onion soup with foie gras and truffles AND puff pastry top....  ummm...  yummy!!!  Verrrrrry rich.  Honestly, I could have stopped there.  Main - Roasted rack of lamb (med/rare...leaning more towards rare) with nicoise olives, preserved tomato and braised flageolet beans... very happy with my dinner.  I love it when a dish comes to the table perfectly seasoned!\n\nJ:  To Start  - Scallop trio which consisted of a truffle encrusted scallop, a scallop wonton, and scallop ceviche.  He snarfed it all down in record time (unlike his wine...which I was all too happy to help him with...  LIGHTWEIGHT)!  Main - Surf and Turf:  Braised short ribs and butter poached lobster.  He ate all of the ribs and lobster, but there was a little dish of some sort of seafood mousse that he did not enjoy at all.\n\nSales rep:  To Start - Ahi Tuna Duo:  He said it was delicious.  There was tuna tartare over Comice pear chutney, and seared tuna with ginger and cilantro.  Main - Surf and Turf:  same result as J.\n\nThe rep insisted on ordering a dessert while J continued to struggle with the 3 large glasses of wine he had accumulated...  Lydia to the rescue!!!  Unfortunately, this led to me being just drunk enough to let our equally inebriated sales rep spoon feed me some of the chocolate souffle.  Hmmmm...  only slightly humiliating!  Oops!\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my meal, and the service was excellent."

I need to start this review by saying we experienced exceptional service. The service alone was so amazing that it could make me come back. This was an extravagant meal so I don't say that lightly. Warm, friendly, knowledgable staff that were perfect over several hours. There is also a Lego model design of the wine tower that was completely charming. I thought it was all very lovely but sadly the food did not live up to the rest of the experience. My duck was so over cooked, I was shocked. I've never once received a well done duck breast in a restaurant and I certainly didn't think I'd see it here. It was very chewy and under seasoned and unfortunately my husband had the same experience with his steak. It was marginal, the highlight of his meal was his side of mashed potatoes. I did taste them and they were great, the mushrooms were also fantastic, I'd recommend them both. While my duck breast was a huge disappointment my confit was great, again, drier than I'd expect but it was wrapped in a nice buttery pastry that balanced that very well. My salad was nothing to really mention, neither good nor bad. Honestly the highlight of the meal for me was the sorbet. It was a fun little assortment of nine different flavors. I wanted to love this place, but the food was average at best."

Unfortunately, the $120 bottle we ordered wasn't enough to warrant any Wine Angel time. :)\n\nWe came here rather late and decided to crash at the seating near the bar area.  Along with our wine we ordered off of the appetizer menu, but the food was quite good.  The rest of the menu looked a lot more expensive, but we were quite satisfied with the bar menu and walked out only $200 poorer including wine, tax, and tip."

The wine list was really cool to peruse through, clicking on options to see their available wines. We definitely spent some time playing around before we selected our choice for the evening. We were able to watch one of the girls climb up to get our wine, which happened to be at the very top. The whole experience was great and I would recommend Aurole to anyone looking for a great dining experience.

First the hostesses were very friendly. They greet you immediately and aren't distracted. Our waiter was very nice and made us laugh throughout the night. You get an iPad at your table to make it easier for you to browse through the drink offerings. I selected a moscato di Asti and it was great. We were headed to watch MJ One so took advantage of the Prix Fixe menu. WOW. Every dish here is just an explosion of flavor. We started off with arugula, burratta, crostini and ham, it also had tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and pesto, the combination sounded strange but the flavors went well together. Next was the prime hanger steak and rock shrimp scampi. With the word scampi I am naive and expected noodles, no noodles here this was the most amazing dish ever. The steak was so tender and exploded with flavor on every bite. The shrimp was amazing. It all sat upon this corn succotash which I am determined to learn to make it was that good! Just when I thought it couldn't get any better they bring out dessert. A German Chocolate lava cake. That was heavenly. It was a lava cake with coconut ice cream. It was one of those dishes  that is so good it transports you to another place and just makes you want to smile. With dessert they serve an espresso infused vodka and brandy cocktail. It was like tiramisu in a glass. 3 courses plus a cocktail all for $58 In Vegas to me is a bargain and I didn't mind paying that much for a meal because it was the best meal I have ever had. The other thing is they don't overfill your plate so you don't leave feeling uncomfortable, just satisfied. Great food, great service, reasonable prices earns them 5 stars."

This was surprising because when we arrived, the place was half-empty.  Our waiter could barely be understood; I didn't catch his name.  Nor could he describe the dishes well or offer meaningful dining suggestions.  He was essentially a scribe,and not very good at that. The drink tablet (one per table in a group this big?) was silly and cumbersome and tedious for all of us to pass around.  The drinks... unremarkable, but not bad.   Our dinner order was a bit mixed up (i.e, part of it wrong) upon arrival.  Our food good but underwhelming (we just ordered a la carte)--maybe the tasting menu could be more special? And to end our night--silliness  with the bill, minor and ultimately addressed. \n\nWe had a great time and nothing catastrophic happened, but as I reread this review, it's summarizes an experience I would expect from TGI Friday's, not reportedly fine dining."

            "review": "I'd like to start off by saying that we have been wanting to try Aureole for years... Their wine lounge is this wino's idea of AWESOME! Unfortunately, with so many great restaurants in Vegas, and typically staying in hotels more north on the strip (Palazzo, Wynn, Bellagio, etc...), we hadn't had the opportunity to. But, on this trip... we decided to stay at Mandalay Bay and so, Aureole was absolutely in our game plan. \n\nOriginally, we'd planned to dine in the Swan Court section of Aureole on the last night in town (we already had plans with friends, every other night of our 7 day trip), but I couldn't wait. After perusing Yelp for awhile, I discovered they had a wine lounge... a bar area... right underneath, basically, the famed wine tower. We could go on night one for a drink and maybe an app or two, prior to meeting up for dinner with our friends. SCORE! \n\nWe come down the beautiful staircase, my eyes fixed on the wine tower, and there it was. A table for us, right in the lounge! We were psyched  to get to experience it and so excited about it. \n\nOur server, Renaldo, asked what we wanted to drink and we asked for a wine list, naturally. He brought us a tablet with a digital wine list (certainly not cutting edge, but pretty cool). We wanted some time to enjoy looking through the massive amount of offerings. Since we're just having pre-dinner bites, we opted to try their wine flights. So far, so good.... \n\nAnd then it all went downhill.... \n\nRenaldo came back with our flights (we selected different ones) and headed off to check on another table. I started with a California Cabernet (my fave) and upon smelling it, knew it wasn't \"right\". It had clearly turned. When Renaldo returned, I informed him of this and he got defensive and said that it most certainly had not. It was a new bottle, he'd opened it himself. I said, well.... then it's a bad bottle. This is a spoiled wine, I'm pretty into wine, so I know when it's rotten. He went over to the bartender (and we watched the entire transaction with him), he asked the bartender for the bottle of Cab, the bartender shows it to him and it's got, maybe enough for a 3oz pour. Hardly a \"just opened\" bottle. He'd lied to me. He didn't open it. It had been sitting, for who knows how long, and turned. Clearly. \n\nRenaldo came back to the table with a fresh bottle, clearly annoyed with me, and poured my glass. And THAT is a how a Cab should taste. But why the drama? I wasn't rude, in the least... I just simply had a bad glass of wine and asked for a new one. A perfectly reasonable request, by anyone's standards... and most certainly in a fine dining establishment that has such a big \"wine\" presence. \n\nNext, my hubs and I decided on two apps to share... the seared foie gras (our fave) and a lobster \"special\". After ordering the lobster special, my husband inquired about the other lobster dish on their main menu. Renaldo said it was very good but we probably wouldn't want it because it \"cost more\"... really? We just ordered a $29 appetizer... the 3rd most expensive on your menu (trumped only by a seafood platter and caviar), clearly we weren't price sensitive. \n\nI am sure people come in and order a fabulous bottle of wine and enjoy the tasting menu and probably spend more than we were planning to that night... but we had plans to come back to do JUST THAT! We just couldn't wait and wanted a sample. Never judge a book by it's cover buddy... isn't that fine dining 101? \n\nAfter much debate... because I almost NEVER ask to speak with a manager at a restaurant... I did, I asked for one. I explained my experience and I explained that I wasn't talking to her because I wanted something comped. My husband and I have more than enough money to pay for our meal. She offered anyway, and I declined. I even still left 18% gratuity, because the food was fabulous and once the wine situation was settled, that was great too. I didn't want the people that share in those tips to be short changed. I do want to note- I typically leave 25-30% tips. So 18% is a big deal... to me that indicates terrible service. I give 20, for just meeting basic expecations. \n\nI spoke with, Rebecca, who kept saying that my complaint seemed strange because Renaldo is \"one of the best captains\"... and that may very well be true, but I didn't really find it very professional. It was as though she too was questioning my experience. She offered me her card. \n\nThe following day, I sent an email to Steve Mainini, the GM. He promptly responded to my email and offered to help ensure we have the kind of experience we'd hoped for. He said \"Please know your observation is well founded and I am \ncertain we can make your next visit an exceptionally positive one\"... I let Steve know that we wouldn't be able to on this trip, but will touch base on our next. \n\nI'm going to give Aureole another chance, via Steve. I want, so badly, to leave loving this Charlie Palmer creation. \n\nUntil then..."

This actually turned out to be a strong point as the entire staff was had great knowledge of the food and the culinary cooking process.  We really enjoyed talking to each and every one of the staff from the server to the captain.  The food was all spot on -- My wife ordered butternut squash ravioli and a tai snapper while I went with the foie gras over a pork bread with a berry sorbet on top and the scallops over pork belly for my main.  Very different and it is evident the executive chef carries out charlie palmers vision of top quality pork dishes.  They bought us an incredible dessert sampler along with a plate of petit fours for the conclusion of the meal.

So much for that - looking for a romantic night, we were seated next to a European couple who were clearly drunk and fighting with each other their whole meal.  And the restaurant was about 25% full yet we were seated next to the drama squad.  Eek.\n\nWe both had the 9 course menu with wine pairings and every single dish needed editing.  A sublime seared diver scallop with beurre blanc was lost under a mess of pea shoots that negated the gentle flavor of the seafood.  Kobe beef came with about 3 too many garnishes that proved distracting from the main event.  After about four courses that I'd call no less than a hot mess on a plate, I was tired.  And I mean exhausted.  I kind of just wanted to leave, take a nap, and then figure out something to eat for dinner.\n\nMaybe I was asking for too much in expecting to be wowed, but when a chef takes the time and energy to plan out nine courses with intricate wine pairings, you should feel excited and envigorated with the presentation of each course.  Instead, it was more like the staff came out almost mechanically, trying to get us through each course and then get us on our way.  I felt the lack of love at every turn, and I was so hoping that this place would be on my list of favorite dining experiences of all time.  Not by a long shot."

My only complaints would be the limited selection of wines by the glass (wife doesn't drink and I can't possibly drink a bottle with dinner) and the close seating for couples along a bench. I didn't get enough time to scope the place out to try and pick a better spot. But it was a minor thing until a loud couple started snuggling side by side on the bench next to us. Gag. And I did get a fine glass of wine, just not the satisfaction of going through pages and pages of wine so that I could agonize over the decision.\n\nAnyway... I ordered the Parallel Tasting menu. Four courses, 2 dishes side by side in each course. Everything was drop dead gorgeous and delicious. There was beef, there was crab, there was salmon. I should have taken notes... Anyway, it was great.\n\nShe ordered a soft shell crab appetizer that was quite good and the Bleu Cheese Crusted Filet that even I, a Bleu Cheese denier, found tasty.\n\nHaving seen on our Open Table reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary, they brought us a complimentary dessert. Nevermind that we had both ordered dessert, it was really nice - a sextet of sorbet balls in 3 flavors. Yum.\n\nFinally, Restaurant.com had a $50 coupon for $4. That was processed with zero fuss and made the evening that much nicer when the bill came. All in all, a wonderful evening."

First off we werent terribly hungry going in because we had eaten a late lunch around 5, so we just wanted to order a small entree each and have a couple of drinks, but then we found out that there is a set meal 95 bucks per person. The waiter was nice enough to let us order entrees only though. My friend got the surf n turf and i got the halibut. Both were dissapointing. My halibut was not seasoned at all and was a bit fishy but my potatoes and asparagus were both pretty good. Her  surf and turf was a veal and ahi tuna, except they were covered in a marinara sauce that was not so great, and the marinara was not so complimentary to the ahi. At least they were able to redeem themselves with a fantastic dessert! We had sorbet and bananas foster. Im not so much into sorbet, but it was so so so good, and even better was her bananas foster. Every bite was fantastic, so kudos to the pastry chef.  It wasn't a horrible experience- i just wouldnt go back unless it was for dessert!"

Sadly, I didnt get to see anyone go up for wine. My bf even suggest they let us go up for fun! Haha\n\nAt first we were a little skeptical with service. From the moment we sat, we waited a good 5 mins for our menu. My bf asked for the menu, momentarily, we saw our waiter walking past our table and then disappears for another 2 mins then he comes back with our menu! PECUILAR much?! Our Bottled water and bread came before our menu, very strange we thought!\n\nShortly after we ordered, this young photographer comes by and started mumbling something to us, some how we ended up taking pictures. STRANGE? i thought so! LOL she made us pose as if it's a prom picture! HILARIOUS!\n\nThey have the coolest wine menu, it's almost like an ipad, but an older version and much heavier! Their wine list is phenomenal, i mean they are the only restaurant with such huge selection of wine! It's quite impressive! My Bf didn't have wine and there wasn't any wine by glass at my interest, so i went with a cocktail. Blood orange maritini! OMG it's so weird, but so good!  I love blood orange! Oh what's weird about this drink is, it had Jalapeno!  Sounds weird Right? But it tasted like fruit punch with a little bit of spiciness. Even my bf enjoyed it! \n\nSo with Appetizers and entrees, we didnt want the prie fixe menu since we've had so many bad experience. \n\nAppetizers\n\nCaviar - served with little miniture pancake that tasted very much like green onion pancake, the chinese kind of course. Toppings such as egg whites, egg yolks, purple onion, cream cheese, and chives were available. mMmMm it was a party in my mouth! It was so orgasmic; im in heaven! \n\nFrench onion soup - it's very tastey and rich. Bf said it's the best he ever had! One can find truffles and foie gras pieces in it :)\n\nSeared foie gras  over toasted brioche and strawberry sorbet! Reminded me so much of the foie gras I had in palazo! AHHHH another orgasmic dish! Huge pieces of foie gras seared to perfection, unforgettable! :) \n\nSamosa curry salad - looked like little pot stickers! The curry itself was very good, but i thought it was gonna be a real salad, and it wasnt! \n\nPull pork sliders - it wasn't dry, but it wasnt to my liking. Still good though better than RN74\n\nAs for entree, we had the Seared Seabass - GROSS, very dry! over cooked, we barely touched it. \n\nLastly, we had the warm mocha chocolate cake. It didn't taste like mocha, it tasted like a every other chocolate lava cake. It wasnt warm, it was cooled off already.  They also sent us sorbet which i enjoyed a lot. It tasted very unique and different than what I am accustomed to.\n\nGreat service, my bf and I hate waiting forever for our food, so we usually let our server know that we would like everything to be fired at once! My oh my was I impressed, Aureole is the only restaurant who brought everything out all at once in a short amount of time! The waiter also took the sea bass off of our bill! :) Great service, will definitely return for the caviar, seared foie gras, and blood orange martini :)"

One of my friends was celebrating her birthday so we asked the host to have some dessert sent out. They sent out a complementary gelato plate for the whole table! I also had a phone conversation with the Assistant Manager, Aaron, who was fantastic as well.

Two for one small plates, wine and cocktails are pretty amazing.  And those sirloin sliders are unbelievable (the two stars are for those...and the happy hour).  But I have to say, the dinner experience was just weird and offensive.\n\nTo start, I walked in and spoke to the host stand to let them know that our party would have one more for dinner.  It was then told that they did not have my reservation.  That was strange, I'd booked with Open Table and had mysteriously already received the points.  Turns out they found my reservation and told me that my party was already seated.  I guess I looked at them funny and they pointed at the table.  Turns out \"I\" was sitting with four people I had never seen before.  So they gave my table away.  No big deal, they weren't that busy, but it was weird that they argued with me that I'd already been seated when I was standing in front of them.\n\nSo they said they'd prepare another table while we waited patiently in the bar.  After 30 minutes, no one came to get us so we checked in again...and finally got our table.  You know it's a bad sign when the first thing out of your server's mouth is a giant sigh.  Then he said, \"cocktails, wine?\"  No greeting, no smile, no nothing.  We asked for the wine list and he stared blankly at us.  We replied that we had no menus but that didn't seem to matter either.  So much for that Wine Spectator award.  They have a lot of great wines but you wouldn't know it, the servers have no clue about them or no desire to talk about them.  After being pressured into ordering beverages, we finally got menus.\n\nThe menus are pretty simple and don't go into a lot of detail.  When the server came back he asked if we would like for him to talk about the menu.  We said yes and he proceeded to explain that they had a tasting menu and an a la carte.  And that was it.  When we asked for suggestions, he muttered something about being really busy.  Then he asked where we were from in a condescending tone.  Ummm...really?  WTF difference does it make?!  You'd think we'd walked in with fanny packs covered in condoms and suckers from a bachelorette party.  \n\nAfter answering no questions, another server came by and asked if we were ready.  When we asked him to talk about the menu, he went into the same spiel about there being a tasting menu and an a la carte.  Yes, we can read, but what about the things ON the menu???  They kept asking if we were ready but wouldn't answer any questions.  At that point, the bread guy was looking like he'd be a more promising server.  It was seriously like pulling teeth.  One even made a snide remark while walking away.  Most places love to talk about the menu, not this place.\n\nI'd reached a point where I really wanted to walk out.  I'm in Vegas for business quite a bit more than I'd like and I know that almost anywhere else would provide better service.  My friends ultimately decided we would stay and we placed our orders.\n\nLong story short-er, my octopus and hearts of palm salad had two slivers of hearts of palm and fishy, chewy octopus (I actually asked my friends what was supposed to come with the octopus because I could not remember and the only other main ingredients on the plate were cherry tomatoes & fingerling potatoes.  What is with this place and fingerling potatoes anyway?  They're in everything, but anyway).  My veal loin was overcooked despite my ordering it prepared as the chef saw fit and it was lukewarm.  The only good part of the meal is that this place seems to always send over comp desserts.\n\nI know everyone's so amazed by the wine angels, but I would have had a better experience watching the rock climbing wall at the gym.\n\nI now hate this place.  We were treated like an inconvenience rather than valued guests.  I miss Fleur de Lys, I really hope they reopen it.  If they don't and you absolutely must go to this place, only go for happy hour, otherwise you will end up leaving pissed and sorry you wasted your time."

I would actually tell them you want to see their bottle list just so you can play with the tablet.  Also, their dessert wines by the glass aren't listed on the paper menu, so if you are looking for a dessert wine, ask for the tablet.\n\nI was surprised that the bar area was so quiet on a Friday evening.  It worked fine for me as I wanted a quiet place to chill before dinner.  Service was okay and the bartender even game me a sample of a great prosecco after he discovered that I like sweeter wines.\n\nOverall, I liked trying this place out.

Let me start by saying that the food, the wine pairings and service were all above expectations.\n\n The tasting menu was enjoyed at a slow pace at our request so we could savor the wines and many courses.   While everything was good, there were a couple star / stand out courses - fois gras - we eat a lot of foie gras and this one was easily in our top few in terms of quality and interesting preparation and wine pairing.    The scallop was also a true stand out.   One of us enjoyed the duck and the other enjoyed the lamb.   Both are good so I would advise if you like duck (crisp outside and rare inside) go for the duck as you don't see it often...   Otherwise the lamb does not disappoint and the pur\u00e9e served with it really makes it pop.\n\nThe wine pairings were probably one of the top pairings we have seen done.    Candidly we are generally let down when we go out to a restaurant and order the wine pairings.  Ordering the wine pairing was definitely worth doing here!   And the pours were substantial - particularly given the 8ish courses!   Also a special shout out to our captain / server - Eric - who was very attentive, handled our food allergy issues well and was generally super knowledgable and \"Johnny on the spot\" whenever you needed anything.   The once or twice we needed something I needed only look up - as he noticed the eye contact and immediately came over to check in."

You need a gimmik to make it noteworthy and to stand apart from the competition. Chef Charlie Palme's Aureole has chosen wine as their over the top signature statement.\n\nI could talk about the food, but I would have to say it's about par with the rest of the Vegas scene. Good juicy steaks, etc. I was dining on a prix fixe menu, as I was with a large group. My options were typical (an ahi appetizer, a filet, and a nice dessert). So my knowledge of the menu is limited, but I was very happy with what they offered, and my meal.\n\nNow, let's jump to the fun part - their take on wine.\n\nAureole decided not to bury their 10,000 + bottles of wine selections in a basement or cellar. Instead, they opted to encase it in an acrylic tower that spans four stories (42 feet) through the center of the restaurant. When you enter the restaurant, you pass by this absolutely amazing tower of wine, displayed for all to see - from all four sides. \n\nYes, it's cool to look at. But even MORE COOL? How they retrieve the wine. A beautiful woman, dressed in a sleek black leotard is hoisted up like a trapeze artist for every bottle. She is referred to as the \"Wine Angel\" and she's absolutely delightful to watch. Every time a bottle of wine is ordered, it's retrieved by the Wine Angel. She's a mesmerizing acrobat as she flies up within the encased tower, plucking your order out of her acrylic Heavens.\n\nYou can also ask for the \"wine tablet\" which is an electronic wine menu. It sounds cooler than it is - as it had a bad user interface. I'd prefer to tip the wine angel $20.00 & tell her to reach for something tasty!\n\nOverall - review? Do go to Aureole once - or at least walk in to see it. The wine angel is something we've all dreamed about!!"

The restaurant is elegant, as many Las Vegas establishments are, with a soft ambiance. \n\nService was, for the most part, quick and attentive. We had a very cheerful waiter who took noticeable care with handling our orders. Our wine waiter was, however, a bit cold and emotionless in explaining how the wine selection worked. They give you an electronic tablet with an extensive wine list, allowing you to filter by many categories. \n\nThe food is amazing. I started with the Peruvian ceviche, onion soup, oysters, and ahi tuna tartar. The ceviche was one of the best I've ever had,  with a nice tang. I loved the tuna tartar and the oysters, but wasn't crazy about the onion soup. For our entrees, we had grilled swordfish and alaskan halibut with a side of mashed potatoes with garlic. My swordfish was delicious, but her halibut was a bit salty. The potatoes was very good. Since we were stuffed, we declined dessert other than tea, but they rewarded us with a complimentary little dessert platter with assorted cakes. \n\nOverall, we loved this place and will definitely come back the next time we visit Vegas."

I've eaten at French Laundry, Gary Denko, etc, and I wasn't expecting that here, but honestly the food wasn't - even - close.  It was extremely underwhelming.  Have a look at my photos if you don't believe me, do most of those items look appetizing?\n\nI also suspect the kitchen was running slow, as the food wasn't as hot (temperature) as it should be.  \n\nService - We had a large party, but if you can't serve us right then don't take the reservation.  For example:  \n\nSimple cocktails shouldn't take 10-15 minutes to make.   \nIf we're celebrating three birthdays, make sure you bring three desserts. \nDon't bring food to the table without knowing where it's supposed to go.  Asking \"who is having steak tonight?\" is acceptable at Chili's.  Not here. \n\n\nWine service, on the other hand, met expectations.  \n\nOVERALL - I expect better food AND service from a restaurant like this."

For the most part I tend to spot many flaws.  Last night I did not spot one flaw!! From the smell of the rug, to the well pressed linen, phenom lighting, attentive staff, polished silverware, fresh roses, great lead sommelier, and overall exceptional hospitality, this restaurant hit the mark! Upon being seated we wanted something more private and I literally pointed at a table and in 45 seconds it was ready to go!! You definitely get what you pay for!!!! \n\nThe food was AMAZING!! amazing ingredients.  Our start was a bottle of Pinot noir from Santa Barbara, with a sweet pea puree/wild mushrooms/duck prosciutto Amazing! next,  the Exec. Chef made a special rack of lamb for me which was absolutely amazing and cooked to perfection med rare!  Our waiter personally brought me into the kitchen and let me thank him personally! \n\nOverall: Great Experience!"

We don't go to Michelin-ranked restaurants (not more than once a year anyway), so needless to say the food was amazing.  I had the prix-fixe, and the fish was perfect (I think it was snapper, perfectly complemented with the sauce and the flavors). My boyfriend had the cod.   You would also never think that a side dish of asparagus could also be so amazing, and the dessert was a burst of raspberry and creme.  We went to Fleur de Lys the next night, and although the ambiance and service there was flawless I appreciated how gracious and patient the waiters were in helping us make wine and food choices.  And the food is something I won't forget - for another year at least."

I could have played with that all day but then... I'm a wine dork.  Service was helpful, if a little pretentious...   they did get us out in time to catch our show, though, which was appreciated.  The sommelier we had (a vivacious blonde woman) seemed to enjoy her job and was helpful ... not snotty at all.    I liked her.\n\nThey have a three course and a seven course menu.  We had the three course with a Champagne cocktail to start (I had the Champagne Negroni) which were quite good, even if they were totally overpriced at $21 a glass.  \n\nUnfortunately, the food was not up to par.   \n\nI had the Scallop Trio appetizer.  The scallop wonton was good but nothing special,  the truffle encrusted scallop was not at all encrusted... just a seared scallop sitting in a mysterious bland sauce... I tasted no truffle at all.   Finally, the ceviche spring roll was covered in some sort of creamy green sauce that didn't taste like much of anything.  Not spicy, not sweet, not savory.. just kind of nothingness.  Disappointing.   I would have liked the two hot items to have actually been hot, as well.  Meh.\n\nMy friends Black Mission Fig and Roquefort Tart w/Serrano Ham was good.  I love that kind of combination of sweet, salty and rich.   However, I felt like it too could have been warmer.   \n\nFor my main, I had the Organic Roast Chicken with Fricassee of Fingerling Potato and Pearl Onion, Truffle Infused Jus...   \nSounds great huh..?  But no, not so much.  Just your average roast chicken...  I've had better elsewhere and again, I didn't taste any truffle.   Portion size was quite large and I ended up leaving more than half.   I guess some folks would appreciate that but I hate wasting food so it just made me sad.\n\nMy friend had the Surf and Turf (braised beef short rib, butter poached Maine lobster, spinach mousseline) and while the short rib was rich, delicious and fall apart tender, she was disappointed by the beefy sauce that covered entire dish, including the lobster and hence, the lobster flavor. \n\nHer husbands Kobe beef special was also just okay, IMO.  I've had far better Kobe at Sent Sovi in Saratoga and the foie at Picasso was superior as well.  Not worth the extra price tag, IMO.\n\nDessert was the cheese plate for me, which was good but featured nothing that I hadn't had before.  Some hard to find artisan cheeses would be nice.   My armagnac was great though.  A first for me, and now I'm corrupted forever. \n\nMy friends lemon verbena creme brulee was very good.  Light in flavor and texture with a thin crust.  Really nice.  \n\nOverall I would go back for the entertainment value of the wine list but only if someone else was paying.  There's simply just better food to be had elsewhere in Vegas.  Sad to say."

But what makes this place unique is their center column wine rack and the wine angels that retrieve the bottles. About 5 years ago when we came by, the angels were scantily clad Vegas girls. Now, they're fully clothed servers. Eh, I guess they felt the attire to be more appropriate. Whatever. \n\nFood was excellent, as expected. The wife had the parallel tasting menu. Due to some food specificity, we requested that some components be substituted. The chef had no problems doing so. \n\nPreparation was impeccable and tastes were truly deserving of praise. The only disappointment was the 2nd course on the parallel menu of salmon prepared 2-ways. Neither were truly impressive.\n\nService was my biggest complaint. The server(s) were extremely polite, friendly, and present. However, the speed of the meal was painfully slow. Typically, 2 hours is my max allotment. 3 hours really tests my patience. Perhaps the kitchen was backed up. Maybe they just expect you to dine and converse for 3 hours. If so, this is not my type of dining experience.\n\nNevertheless, this was a very pleasant experience.

Before dinner, we had drinks at Red Square next door which has an amazing vodka selection.  If you're really crazy, you can go into the ice room where you have to wear parkas and shoe covers.  My wife wasn't down for that because she was wearing fancy shoes for Aureole.\n\nAureole appears to no longer have long tasting menus and instead has a four-course (which is really 8 courses) \"parallel\" tasting menu.  Each course is brought out on a plate with 2 halves to eat side by side.  Basically, we loved everything they put in front of us.  The beet sald and the duck were particular highlights for me.  The wine pairings were excellent and they provided VERY generous pours (something I consider a hallmark of a great tasing menu).  The quality of wines were outstanding (Inniskillin for desert, all right).\n\nWe had a blast at Aureole.  The servers and food were great and we'll definitely go again sometime.  The only negative thing I can say is not once (not even once) did I seen any of the wine fairies go up the tower.  My wife said she saw one when we were first walking in but I missed it.

I had NO idea what to expect from this place. We were in Vegas this weekend to meet up with my fiance's mom, aunt, step sister & two sisters who were all visiting from various states. (mostly back East) His two sisters decided to book our Sat night dinner at Aureole. The restaurant itself is quite impressive with it's high ceilings and monstrous wine tower. They friggin have wine stewards PROPELLING up & down to get your wine! Like wine rock climbing! It's crazy.....anyway, we started off with our $17 cocktails which were good, but c'mon now....$17?! Whateva...then we were served our amuse bouche (yup, I learned that from Top Chef..haha) that was absolutely amazing. I can't remember what everything was, but it was all great. Then we were given our choice of the Chef's Tasting Menu (like 7 courses...forget how much it was) or your choice of First, Main & Dessert courses ($85). We all opted for the later of the two. Personally, I couldn't handle 7 courses. \n\nFor my first course I ordered the butternut squash raviolis in brown butter sage sauce.............ohhhh good lawd, really, it was pure ecstasy in my mouf. (I'm salivating right now thinking of it) For my main course I chose the Mediterranean sea bass w/blood oranges. It was really good, but I think I prefer Chilean sea bass. It just tastes better when it's endangered.....I kid, I kid. No really, I do prefer Chilean sea bass tho. Anyhoo, for my dessert I chose the Caramel/Chocolate souffle w/banana & Bailey's ice cream. I'm no chocolate fiend, but this shit was tasty. \n\nThe service was great....until the end when we waited FO'EVA for our check, but eh, whatever. Bill came to about $110 per person (7 of us) which wasn't too bad. The best thing was my fiance's mom & aunt picked up the bill!!

A few of the dishes we ordered, on the a la carte menu, two (the ricotta ravioli appetizer and the veal shank) were two of the best dishes we've ever encountered.  And we've eaten at the French Laundry, Joel Robuchon, etc.  They served a steak knife with my veal, but I didn't need it.  The brazed meat fell apart with the touch of my fork, and the warm spices, beans, and strong salty prosciutto tortellini melded in a symphony of fall flavor.  My wife's salmon ricotta ravioli is one of the best to or three things we've ever eaten.  The creamy texture of the cheese supported the decadent salmon and vegetables perfectly.  It's simply indiscribable and a must-order.  The waiter recognized as much (he asked my wife if she'd ever been there before, as she had ordered two of the best things on the menu.)\n\nThe service was almost top-notch (the interaction with the sommelier and the waiter was a bit awkward, and the table next to us didn't get their coffee with their dessert). The electronic wine tablet is a great idea, though I couldn't get it to work (and I'm a technie).  I couldn't scroll through the varietal menu without first selecting one of the grapes at the top of the alphabetical list (so to scroll to granache, you'd have to click on cabernet, and all that would come up is cabernets...).  Since we were interested in \"c\" wines, that was fine with me.  Others have commented on servers forgetting a table, bringing things out incorrectly, or simply being rude.  Other than what I listed above, and a slightly too fast pace for dinner, none of that here--everyone was professional, friendly and attentive.  And we were there on a Sunday night at 6:30.\n\n The sommelier's recommendation for a cab franc was good, and the wine was tasty, but not out of this world.  But, I guess that's what you get for a $68 bottle of French wine at a place like this.\n\nA few recent reviews commented on the small portions.  We found that to be just the opposite.  For a fine dining restaurant, the portions were HUGE! My wife and I could not finish our entrees and could barely get to the huge selection of sorbets.  It's not the Sizzler or an all you can eat buffet, but the portions certainly didn't leave you wanting more -- they left you wanting to clean your plate.\n\nAnd, of course, the giant wine tower, with its gathering angels, was a sight to behold.\n\nMaybe it's not the most inventive cuisine now, but Aureole does not disappoint.  4.5/5, rounded up to 5 because of the ravioli and veal."

The other half of the course was salmon nicely with a red wine reduction.\n\nDessert was a baklava stack with concord grapes and ice cream in the middle.

After all the rudeness and check delivered, we were charged for dessert after several servers advised it was part of the prix fix menu. We didn't even want dessert and then they tried to charge us for it. It was really strange. Last, we needed to split our bill and had 3 cards- for their convenience we wrote down each amount for each card, making it easy as pie.  But then the great check debacle happened and they decided no- we're going to do it our way and split it evenly 3 ways leaving our one friend being charged double what she should have paid.\n\nI've never experienced such poor service and I feel bad for giving such a bad review, but I want other visitors to this restaurant to be forewarned.

So I asked him to find our what type of red they were offering, he walks over to the bar, comes back and says \"Australian\". Seriously. It's a WINE bar and this dude could not have known less about wine. I took a chance and ended up with a decent (not great) Syrah blend. We also ordered several apps, including the Oysters of the day, the Serrano ham, the cheese board, and based on the server's recommendation, the sliders. He failed to mention the oysters were cooked (Rockefeller) and they were terrible. The cheese board literally came with two pieces of cheese about 2 inches square, 4 giant crackers, a blob of honey and two pecans. The Serrano ham was a decent portion, but nothing special. The sliders were indeed the best item on the list - the meat and the truffle aioli were fantastic. \n\nI assume they must at least step up the service level (if not the food) for dinner, but I would probably not come back here and definitely wouldn't recommend it for happy hour. Oh, and those famous flying wine angels? Not there for happy hour either."

For dinner, the ambiance is open and pleasant. Service was very good. I would say the food is a 8.5 out of 10. There are better places to eat, but this is among the top. If you love wine, this is the place to go. Amazing wine selection - they even give you a digital computer pad to select from because their wine list is so extensive. \n\nThey have a sampling menu complete with wine pairings for a very good price - $85 dinner only/add $55 with wine pairings.\n\nThe only thing we did not like was that they had some girl offering to take your photo when we were there. Totally not a fit with the atmosphere. Maybe she was the owner's daughter??"

It goes from the ceiling all the way down to the bottom of this restaurant since you have you have to go downstairs for the dining area.  It looked very cool when the waitresses got the wine in the cellar because it looked like they were on air and the walls of the cellar are all glass.  We didn't have reservations but we were lucky enough to get a table for 2 that friday night.  \n\nThe staff is very attentive.  I loved the selection of bread. I kept asking for more. I felt bad but hey!  good bread at a restaurant always gets to me. can't get enough of it!  It was nice of the chef cook to give us complimentary dishes and desserts too.  The layout of every dish were fantastic, very classy, and clean.  \n\nDefinitely a good definition of fine dining in vegas!"

The staff was weary from the weekend, perhaps.  We lost 3 of 4 staff before our entrees arrived.  They were out of the halibut. The bread was chilled. Not just room temperature, chilled.  Service was slow.  Which would not have been a problem, except I was brought the wrong steak, and was then pressured to accept it, because the one I ordered was inferior anyway.  I was assured I would not be charged the difference in price, but I ordered the steak I ordered intentionally, because it was the one I wanted.  Meanwhile the steak wasn't cooked to order anyway.  It was rarer than I requested.  A lot.  So I think it was a truly stray steak.  Or the staff didn't want to say they were out of the halibut and the New York steak.  We poured our own wine half the time.  Our last remaining server invested in the group next to us, to the point of offering club-going advice and comp options, but blew us off once he blew my order.  It was sad to see a giant nearly whole bone-in filet get sprinkled with the crumbs off our table without a question whether we wanted to take it and our nearly whole side of quinoa to go.  Aside from the swan court venue, a terrible experience.  I recommend N9ne if you need a perfect steak, or Craftsteak, or SW or Sage or Nob Hill or Botero or the Wynn buffet / Cosmopolitan buffet before I would eat here.   Unless you are forced to eat here for a business dinner or you are fully comped, then I would eat the risotto or onion soup, and that's it.  The wine list is impressive, but not worth the bad food drama."

Was a little disappointed w/this particular Charlie Palmer location. Maybe Dry Creek won't disappoint the next time I go to Wine Country..\n\nAlso, there was a rather pushy photographer moving from table to table offering to take pictures of people, and then interrupting your dinner with a sales pitch.

Make a note to not sit in the swan room next time.\n\nI made reservations for 2 at 9.30 on Saturday. They close their kitchen at 10.30. The Server pulled out my chair and and put on my napkin. Good signs.\n\nI opted for the 4-course 8 dishes, $95 parallel prix fixe menu, and my bf got the $85 3-course. spring pea and ricotta ravioli for appetiser, grilled N.Y. strip loin with a side of rustic smashed potato.\n\nMy dungeness crab and ahi tuna mille feauille was was delectable, perfectly accompanied by the coconut kefir lime froth. It was a refreshing cold dish, layered with avocado. The crab was definitely very fresh.\n\nThe parallel was the seared dungeness grab cake, bedded with papaya. It was bursting with flavours, and as a hater of red pepper? I devoured it all.\n\nSecond course came the olive oil poached wild king salmon. one of the most tender salmon i've had, with a hint of citrus that accompanied the fish very nicely.\n\nthe parallel was the house made salmon angelotti in tomato dressing. The Angelotti was very al dente, I wasn't that big of a fan of this dish. it was slightly bland for my taste. I think the salmon was overpowered by the angelotti.\n\nNext up came the Wagyu beef strip loin bedded with an abalone mushroom. The beef was very tender, the meat was full of original flavour. i did not like the abalone mushroom, the mushroom taste was overwhelming! i am normally a fan of mushroom too.\n\nThe parallel was the sea diver scallop surrounded by gnocci, morel mushroom and fava beans. O.M.G. the best scallop i've ever had. the freshness oozed out of every bite i tried to savour. It was cooked to perfection. The Gnocci was a little bland. The beans and mushroom completed the dish.\n\nMy boyfriend's spring pea and ricotta ravioli was delicious. al dente and i quote \"the best ravioli i've ever had\" For spring pea, it was full of flavour and scrumptious.\nHis NY strip loin was pretty good, but not the best. it was still slightly hard in medium rare. it was huge though!\n\nDessert was the cherry on top. My BF was stuffed and didn't want any dessert, but they still gave us a plate of 6 assorted sorbets on the house! one or two of them was a little sour, but everything else was very fruity that flawlessly melts in your mouth.  I was stuffed at this point. I finished the lemon mascarpone semifreddo, that had whole blueberries inside, YUM! Everything was melt in your mouth delicious! However, i didn't manage to finish the blueberry meyer lemon financier as I was too full. I had a couple bites and it was just too filling for me. it tasted like cake but denser, still very good. Maybe I should've packed it!  The blueberry lemon verbena sorbet was too sour for my liking. \n\nAs we exited, rows and echoes of goodbyes and thank yous was said to us from all the servers around, including those that didn't serve us. What a way to end a special night!\n\nTip: Tasting menu is the way to go! only $10 more anyways! you will get full! Don't eat too much bread because you can get full from your 8 course!\n\nFavourites: fresh, delicious and delicately cooked. great service\n\nDo not want: pricey i guess? not too much. lack of choices\n\nLast words: A perfect dining experience!"

We loved the concept of the \"wine Angels\" and thought we'd be treated to an amazing meal with a warm atmosphere given the other reviews on Yelp. \n\nBoy were we wrong. \n\nAfter being seated at our table my husband pointed at the wine vault. I turned around to attempt to see and noticed the glass divider behind me was frosted. I was unable to view anything going on with the wine vault. Also, the tables are not centered around it as we both assumed they'd be (and we all know what happens when one assumes....) \n\nOkay, so it wasn't centered around gravity defying, wine grabbing ladies. No biggie. They must have a great selection of wine, right?! That they do BUT they present it in an iPad from 2004 judging from its weight. Okay...progressive people, I'm cool with that! Except the list is broken down into such minute categories with no way to view them all at once. Want a wine from France? Better know what region it comes from! You also better be prepared to sift through eight regions broken down by grape TYPE. \n\nAfter being greeted by the sommelier who did nothing to help us (\"oh, it's hard to browse the menu? Take a few more minutes then to decide. I'm not going to offer any suggestions cause that's not my job\" *leaves table*) we were greeted by our (what I can only assume was our arrogant waiter) who read the menu to us and then (literally) tossed the menu back in front of me and walked off. No suggestions, no asking if we needed anything...nada. Dude walked off like he had just done us a favor. Cause we can't read. Ugh. \n\nThe only redeeming thing that night was the very nice GM who asked us our opinion of the new wine menu. We actually booked a reservation at Veranda at the Four Seasons while sitting here. After leaving before ordering (something I have never done!) we had an AMAZING meal at Veranda!!"

The service (or shall I say server) was mainly the issue. From start to finish, our server was pushy toward our large group and left in the blink of an eye after he said everything he wanted to say without giving anyone a chance to really respond or say anything back. He got the wrong order, neglected to bring some order, and bragged to us about how he didn't charge for the dessert that came out since it was a birthday celebration. I thought restaurants didn't really charge for a birthday dessert in the first place?\nIt was very hard to speak up at the time because our parents were wanting to have a good time and keep the spirits up and not be downers. We were all definitely boiling inside, but to be considerate to the establishment, we didn't really speak our frustrations until after the dining experience had ended. The interesting thing to note was that when we did go to the manager to share our experience that night, she didn't really do anything to help the situation except told us that \"next time, we should speak up during the dining\".

On this particular occasion, we chose Aureole at Mandalay.\n\nAs they showed us to our table, I reminded them that I had requested side by side seating in our reservation.  At that point, she asked if we wouldn't mind a booth and showed us to a lovely booth in the Swan's Court overlooking the swan pond.  This was actually nicer than sitting in the main dining room.\n\nWe knew we wanted to do one of their prix fixe menus, and they had two on this particular evening.  We decided on the Parallel Tasting Menu ($85 per person).  We didn't realize that this meant we would both get everything on the menu, which we actually found to our benefit.\n\nFirst Course:\n* Dungeness Crab and Ahi Tuna Mille Feuille, Coconut Kefir Lime Froth - Just as the waiter was about to present this to us, he realized that perhaps I could not eat the ahi tuna since I was preggos.  He immediately whisked it back to the kitchen and said he would take care of it.  We thought that was really sweet that he even remembered!  When it did arrive, only the Husband got it on his plate and I did not.  Nicely presented with a pretty foam, he wasn't as impressed with it as the crab cakes. \n* Seared Dungeness Crab Cake, Papaya Salsa, Yuzu Aioli - The Husband received only one of these while I received three (since I didn't get the crab and tuna mille feuille).  I thought it was so good, especially with the aioli.  The salsa added a nice sweetness and it was just licking it all up!\n\nSecond Course:\n*Olive Oil Poached Wild King Salmon, Citrus Braised Fennel, Sambal Buerre Blanc - I'm not the biggest fan of cooked fish, but the poached salmon was okay although not extraordinary.\n* House made Salmon Angelotti, Wilted Pea Tendrils, Olive Tomato Emulsion - The agnolotti pasta was a bit tough and doughy, and looked more like bone marrow covered in red sauce when it was presented.\n\nThird Course:\n* Japanese Pepper, Wagyu Beef Strip Loin, Grilled Abalone Mushroom, Sweet Potatoes Fries - My biggest fault in ordering this dish was having it medium well, which isn't exactly how I would usually have my beef (rare, please).  I think this played a factor as to why my meat was tough and not as enjoyable as it could have been.\n* Seared Diver Sea Scallop, Yukon Gold Morel Mushroom and Fava Beans, Potato Gnocchi - Who doesn't like a perfectly cooked diver sea scallop?  Yum yum yum.  And with mushrooms?  Even better! \n\nFourth Course: \n* Blueberry Meyer Lemon Financier \n* Lemon Mascarpone Semifreddo\n* Blueberry Lemon Verbena Sorbet\nAll the desserts, including the complimentary trio of sorbets, were just wonderful.  (I think the flavors were coconut, tangerine, and watermelon.)  We enjoyed every bit of our trio of desserts and could have kept on going.  They definitely do their sorbets very well here too.\n\nService was fabulous.  The waiter was attentive without being overbearing and our beverage glasses were refilled in almost a timely manner.  The one thing that isn't so great is the house photographer.  They offer to take your picture at the beginning of the meal and have you pose in certain ways too, and then show you various packages you can buy at the end.  It's pretty expensive for a few pictures and ultimately, you just don't want it.  It can put a damper on your evening when you just want to dine, and not worry about buying silly pictures.\n\nOverall, Aureole was a good experience.  It wasn't super fabulous and we weren't there to watch the Wine Fairies, but it was a good meal overall.  Of course, it helped that we had a restaurant.com coupon too."

Nothing to write home about and after entering it in to my Vivino app and learning that this $65 bottle is sold for $17, it explained it.  I expect a mark up, but feel like we were directed to a bigger money maker than the others would have been.  My husband chose the Lamb, it was good, but not $55 good.  A little on the dry side, which I find hard at medium rare.  The sausage side that was served beside it was the best thing on his plate.  I had the duck, and loved the sides it was served with and the portion size of the duck was good too, but the duck itself was very dry and almost tasteless.  We ordered additonal sides of the Duck Fat Fries and the Tuffle Rissoto.  We LOVED both of the those.  Really wished by the end of the night that we would have just spent $30 on the sides and saved ourselves the $200 bill for a disappointing meal.  The service was very attentive and the atmosphere light and quiet (that might have been because of the time of night we were there).  I'm guessing we hit them on an off night or maybe at the end of their shifts based on the great reviews and longevity of this resturant, but we will not be back to test that theory."

They have one of the largest wine selections I have ever seen....why else would they need to give you a separate wine tablet to take your wine order.\n\nWe enjoyed a prix fixe menu, but keep in mind this was almost 2 years ago, so I'm not going to bore you with food that may not even be on the menu anymore.\n\nI do remember being dazzled by the decor and ambiance of Aureole.   This restaurant makes for a perfect romantic evening with that special someone!"

My friends own a restaurant in Chicago - so they called ahead to let the staff know a table full of chefs were coming in for a b-day.  You know right there that we received an amazing menu, and top-notch service.  12 courses of completely phenomenal food - attention to detail was ridiculous, catering to my food allergies and my  friend's vegetarian lifestyle (which is expected at a place like Aureole, but they were above and beyond my expectations).  This was a 5-star visit - everything was absolutely PERFECT.\nSecond visit:\nOne year later.  I had my birthday dinner at Fleur de Lys (posted a review for that, as well).  The next night, my boyfriend and I decided to visit Aureole for dessert and wine.  It was not quite 10 pm when we arrived and were told unceremoniously by the hostess (before she even said hello) that they were closed.  I could see people still on beginning courses of their meals - so I knew that at least the pastry chef was still around.  We asked if we might sit at the bar and just have a dessert wine, she huffed and said \"Fine.\"  The bar area was full but not crowded or hectic.  We were simply ignored by the bartender for several minutes - he finally came over and we asked what dessert wines, ports, etc. were available.  He said \"just one\" and poured 2 glasses, then left us alone again [he was not in the weeds, nor even close to busy enough to justify such treatment].  One dessert wine???  In all of Aureole?  Come on.  We caught his attention again and asked if we could still order dessert, he seemed surprised that we thought we couldn't (thanks hostess).  Dessert was fine, not spectacular, and we sat and watched every other bar patron receive better service than us.  I was so disappointed, we left quickly, wishing we had tried dessert somewhere else.\nPerfect example of why NOT to dismiss a young, well-dressed couple - we love food, I have worked in restaurants for years, and generally know what type of service/food I should get for my dollar.  This was a total disappointment, and I have told everyone I know to try other Vegas restaurants instead - this one has turned the corner from \"perfect\" to \"pretentious\"."

Reception is more efficient than welcoming and you are soon escorted to your table.  For such an apparently sophisticated locale dress is remarkably casual.  My coat and tie were in the minority, as was my touch of gray hair.  We have been there twice and both times the clientele was predominantly 20 and 30-somethings and in shirt sleeves and fashionable jeans.  Ask for a table in the back near the waterfall and swan pond.\n\nThe wine list is indeed impressive, but is presented on what must be the original pad computer.  It requires a stylus, is balky and is as non-intuitive as can be.  Come with an idea of what wine you want and insist the sommelier operate the damn thing for you before she slips away.   Service overall was excellent though it was Valentine's Day evening and the place was packed.\n\nWe both ordered fish, perhaps not the specialties of the house.  The swordfish in citrus with vegetables was beautifully presented.  The root vegetables were partially peeled with the skins tied into butterfly wings.  The fish was only good by comparison.  The red snapper, characterized by our waiter as flaky, was under cooked and flavorless.  It was presented on a bacon infused bed of vegetables that were much better than the fish.  The side of root vegetables was uniquely spiced and delicious.\n\nThe star of the meal was the onion soup, presented under a pastry shell the waiter cut open.  Excellent.  For such a highly rated restaurant the evening was disappointing."

Besides maybe New York there is no other city in the county that can rival Las Vegas in this regard. So, it figures that when it comes to going big in the arena of wine Las Vegas should know how to take care of business! And that is exactly what they have done with Aureole at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino.\nA Charlie Palmer restaurant, Aureole is second to none in the \"Go Big\" with wine category. After all, the first thing you notice when walking across the elevated catwalk and down the stairs just to get into the restaurant is the four story high wine tower! This skyscraper-like structure measures 14 feet square and holds approximately 9,865 bottles. And just to throw in a little Vegas theatrics they hoist \"wine angels\" up and down the tower plucking bottles of wine out of the sky for the enjoyment of their dinner guests.\nAnd if the larger than life wine tower weren't enough to catch your eye, then the digital wine list is sure to keep you captivated for hours on end. Search threw thousands of bottles within minutes by making a few quick taps to the screen on one of many Tablet PC's turned wine list floating around the dining room. Feel free to place your order digitally or maybe drop an email to the house. This compact machine is loaded with all kinds of techno-wine wizardry that could only be found in one place - Las Vegas baby!"

He brought extra ice for the drinks when he saw us running low, filled our glasses with sparkling water (on the house) when he knew we did not need another whole bottle and comped us dessert.  I hope this guy ends up running the place because without him it was one star only!\n\nONE ran late because of technical difficulties so we arrived 15 minutes late for our 8:45 reservation.  We waited another 15 minutes for them to \"set up\" a table despite the fact that there were easily a dozen available tables.\n\nThey brought out the wrong wine and then told us that the one we ordered (from their high-tech ipad wine inventory) was sold out.   So we re-ordered and, of course, the food was out well before we had a glass of wine poured.\n\nThe salmon tartare was bland - needed salt.  The steak tartare was equally uninspiring and the fried bone marrow was just gross.    The second course consisted of a perfectly cooked scallop, but unfortunately paired with an oily piece of Chilean sea bass.\n\nThe third course Veal Scallopini looked (and did not taste much better) than a McDonald's hash brown.   To make matters worse, I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir (recommended with the dish) that they brought out in a plain Chardonnay glass.   The table next to us had a Cabernet in proper glasses.  I had to ask for the right glass and they appeared with a proper Pinot Noir glass.  Why not the first time?\n\nDesserts did not delight either.   The white chocolate cheesecake was hard; the (comped at least) sorbets were even a bit too mild.  The macaroon was tasteless.  At least the small piece of meringue was lovely.\n\nApparently this place is used to having tourists as customers and do NOT care to prepare them the finest food nor to serve them with the care that might be taken care with a regular.  \n\nWe ate at the \"Culinary Dropout\" at the Hard Rock Casino for lunch.   The service was great, the cocktails fresh and the food competently prepared.   Go there anytime compared with Aureole."

I came here with two other girls and we all ordered off of the Michael Jackson experience dining menu (this was in the summer). Every course was superb. It was cooked to perfection and had me savoring every bite. I was in food heaven.\n\nWhat was truly spectacular, though, was that we were fortunate enough to be invited back to the kitchen and meet all of the chefs. It was a slower night, so we were able to get a peek behind the scenes. Needless to say, some of the nicest people I've ever met AND fantastic at their jobs.

I had the parallel tasting menu, which included shrimp two ways (ceviche with avocado, crispy with chili sauce), roasted sea bass, rabbit with truffles and fettuccine, beef loin, sweetbreads, and macaron and creme brulee for dessert. The rabbit and the desserts were the main standouts for me. My friend had the wine pairing along with it, but he said the pairings were not all that great.\n\nThe other highlights food-wise were the onion soup served in puff pastry, and the dessert sampler. \n\nOkay. Now for the rest. I hope you're not going anywhere.\n\nThe service here was ATROCIOUS. Call me crazy, but if I'm dining at a one Michelin star restaurant with a group of people whose tab is over $1100 bucks, am I wrong to expect service that's better than my local Chili's? I guess so.\n\nWe were seated by one waiter/captain and ordered drinks. My friend's wife ordered a glass of wine, and another person ordered a cocktail (amaretto sour). We then proceeded to order dinner. About half the table wanted the tasting menu, while the other half wanted to go ala carte. The waiter said that would be just fine. We also indicated that we were going to be paying separately...also told that would be fine.\n\nFood service began. Those that ordered the tasting menu got their food first. The head waiter/captain (different guy now) failed to describe all of the courses after they were served. He totally flubbed the dessert course...basically seemed like he had no idea what they were serving. The half of the table that ordered the tasting menu got almost all of their food before the other half got theirs, so half of our party just sat there twiddling their thumbs while the others ate.\n\nFinally the other food came out. Several people ordered steaks. None of them were asked if their steak was cooked to their preference. My friend's wife that ordered one glass of wine? She was brought two, for some reason. She also ordered a side dish that was never served. \n\nThroughout the meal, no water glasses were refilled. I had to ask each time for more water. Empty cocktail glasses sat unbussed. Breadcrumbs were never swept away. Empty sweetener packets were left on the table. \n\nAfter everyone had eaten, they brought out dessert menus. We looked but opted not to order anything. For some reason, two desserts were brought to our table. We thought that since no one ordered anything, these must have been given to us gratis. Nope! They showed up on our bill.\n\nSpeaking of the bill. Like I said earlier, we had indicated that we were going to be paying separately. The waiter told us that he couldn't split it for us, but if we wanted to personally divide up the check he could put it on multiple cards. We gave in and did it. As we're tallying up the tab for everyone, head waiter dude comes back and basically chastises us, saying \"you know, if you would have told me at the beginning of the meal that you wanted the check separated, I could have done it then. But now it's too late.\" Really dude? Fuck you.\n\nThe last straw was when we finally had our bill sorted, everyone paid and signed. As we're leaving, dipshit waiter guy runs up to us claiming that one of us (me) hasn't paid. Bullshit. I said my bill is on the table. He says no, I never saw it. So I walk back to the table, and it's under a fucking napkin. Good job Einstein. Never thought to look there?\n\nThe service at this restaurant is honestly one of the worst service experiences I've ever had. I almost feel like because we were a party of nine, and gratuity was automatically included, that they just said \"fuck you we're getting tipped no matter what.\" If I'm dropping that much coin I expect things to run much more smoothly. It's a shame, because the food here isn't bad. But then again I've had much better for much cheaper. I can't imagine any reason I would ever come back here, especially with the multitude of other fine dining options available in Las Vegas.\n\nAnd if I ever see that worthless waiter again I'm gonna punch him in the balls."

Happy Hour is limited to the Lounge area with seating choices of bar chairs, high top tables and leather booths. Lounge seating offers a good view of the wine tower.\nThe wait staff is first class, friendly, helpful and attentive. The Happy Hour menu is listed as small plates. In comparison to off strip places the Happy Hours portions are truly small. \nThe Caprese Salad with Heirloom Tomatoes was an excellent starter. \nThe Sirloin Sliders are juicy and served with Guacamole and Chipotle sauces on the side. The Onion Soup is not traditional in that it is covered with Puff Pastry. It has great flavor due to the Foie Gras, Truffles and Gruyere Cheese. \nHere is a Tip - Aureole advertises that Happy Hour begins at 5 PM however food service does not  begin until  5:30 PM."

In fact i think at times people fool themselves into thinking their $50 scallop is amazing just because the portion is so small and it's expensive.  As a frequent eater all over the place, I've learned to be much more critical. \n\nI've seen this restaurant featured so many times on the Food Network, Style Network and more.  The center of attention is this GRAND scale wine center, where their \"wine angel\" is harnessed and suspends inside selecting your wine for you.  For the price point of the restaurant, some of the dishes were better than others.  The sliders were mediocre, but the Venison in this apple puree was so good that everyone thought it tasted like lamb, there was no gamey flavor at all.  Though I didn't try it, I was told that the clams were quite delish. Not sure if I'll go back, but it was definitely a nice place.  I wonder how such a large restaurant only has ONE mens bathroom stall."

The rest of the meal - service and food - was very bad.  The server was a nearly incoherent older man who ignored us most of the time. We said we wanted to have a cocktail and when he returned after some very long interval...he pushed right into 'what are you going to eat.' He was not gracious in any way...questioning my guests choices, chastising us for asking questions.  I really couldn't believe it!  He was like a caricature of a grumpy French waiter in a staid old NY restaurant. The service throughout the entire meal never got better...not better timing and definitely not better table manners. My guests had a special steak that looked good but was nearly cold by the time it was carved and hit the table.  The sides were average. I had some special gnocchi that was tasteless.  Very disappointing. By comparison, the previous night we ate at Stripsteak across from this restaurant and it was incredible and beat this experience hands-down in every way."

My girlfriend and I decided to try this restaurant because we wanted to go to a nice restaurant for our anniversary, and because we are both wine lovers. When we were seated at our table our server came over and started speaking in Spanish to us. Neither of us are very fluent in Spanish, so we kindly asked him if he could speak to us in English. His reply was \"NO! You should know the language, so you must try\". First of all, I realize that I should know a second language, but a fine dining restaurant is not the venue in which I'd like to buff up on my Spanish skills. \n\nNext came the wine . That was delicious, and the highlight of our experience. \n\nWhen our entrees arrived, the server did not leave. He asked us about the wine in Spanish, and made us try to reply to him in Spanish. He said \"I'm not leaving until you say it correctly\". Then he asked us where we were from and we replied \"San Diego\". He wanted to know how long the drive was. Then then went on to say \"The reason I'm asking is because the girl that I was dating lived in San Diego, and we used to meet in Barstow or Victorville, get a hotel room, and then drive back our separate ways. Do you two think that I did the majority of the driving? It doesn't matter now though, she broke up with me...but whatever\" First of all, yes...you did do the majority of the driving. Second of all, I don't want to hear about your sexual escapades while I'm trying to eat my dinner (which by the way was a terrible overcooked piece of pork). Not worth the money. \n\nGot back to the hotel after dinner, and about 4 hours later we were both very sick from the food and spent the rest of the night running to and from the bathroom. Take your money, and spend it elsewhere!"

            "review": "I've walked by Aureole many times, but had heard wide varying experiences from fellow diners about them.  I remember thinking their wine tower sure is impressive looking and that's probably why I've never been tempted to try them.  Similar to my experiences of a hotel that has an opulent impressive lobby, but outdated and junky rooms, I have imparted this feeling of caution to restaurants like Aureole.  Nevertheless a group Vegas trip to celebrate multiple bdays was enough for me to just go along with the flow.  Unfortunately, this time my prior hesitations were confirmed.  It's a good thing I was with good company, bc otherwise the dinner would have been without merit.  Completely not worth it and I whole heartedly recommend you stay away from here.\n\nI always start good things first, but this is gonna be very short.  It's clean and quiet environment.  If you think Vegas is just way too loud and you look for respite from the ding ding ding's of slot machines, you won't notice it here.  They have a nice area at the back of the restaurant with a window overlooking a fountain in a small lake, which I would suggest you request to be seated in if you are dining here.  They have a few private rooms available, but be forewarned that the prix fixe meals you order from are the same menus you can order in the main dining room, just $30 more per person.  (What?!)  \n\nIt's a total disappointment.  Even though the wine tower does make a dramatic introduction the poorly lit staircase which spirals down around it destroys it.  There's a very slow elevator, but I decided to walk down this monument to Aureole's \"greatness\" in order to experience the full effect.  As I arrived at the bottom, I thought, \"meh.\"  The ambiance here can be nice or boring depending on your situation.  An intimate dinner for two to revel in each others' eyes and hold hands, you'll probably enjoy it.  To me it was boring.  Quiet, stuffy, and unless you're seated at the rear of the restaurant (which has a nice window looking out to a fountain/lake) it's a total drag.  Even though there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant, our large party was seated right at the foot of the wine tower in the front of the restaurant.  It was very distracting to hear the loud descending footsteps of later arriving diners during our meal.  People in our party ordered a couple bottles of wine, but because we were seated at the bottom of the wine tower, we never got to see them retrieve it.  I'm not certain that they even did have to retrieve the bottles from the wine tower.  Similar to dining at an over-rated on the beach restaurant way after the sun has set and darkness envelopes you, I felt we missed the best part for putting up with inflated prices and mediocre food.  Restrooms are ridiculous.  An \"open concept\" gone extremely wrong.  there is no door to the powder room on the woman's side or the men's side, both which have a communal circular trough with only one water dispenser to wash your hands as well as a mirror.  So ladies, don't expect any privacy or space if you're going to touch yourself up.  There is also only one toilet room on each side too (which fortunately does have a door), but everyone else has to wait outside the powder areas and watch each side wash their hands.  It's truly an idiotic design. Service was also abysmal considering this is supposedly a top notch restaurant in Vegas. From start to finish, things took a a long time and with none of the polish of a top restaurant.  Drinks took forever to get to our table, food arrived without a known destination and a diner-like question from the server of \"fish?\", and the fastest most efficient service was in delivery and collecting the check.  I hate restaurants are incompetent until they want you to pay up and get the hell out.  Food was also sadly poor.  Although there were several prix fixe meals to choose from, only the most expensive sounded appetizing.  And since things were on such an impressive start, I decided to save myself some money and order their cheapest and least appealing prix fixe meal.  I won't go into detail in what I had since they rotate the menu frequently and others more than likely won't be able to order anything I had, but everything was just ho-hum.  Is it my fault I was disappointed with my meal?  Maybe, but I feel I wasn't missing out on anything based on the reactions of my fellow diners who had ordered more extravagantly and had saved myself some money to lose at the tables.  = )  Finally the worst part of the meal was dessert.  Multiple bdays meant multiple free desserts which at first seemed delightful since they came out with a large assortment of sorbets, cakes, and other items.  But not one of them was tasty.  In fact several of the fruit sorbets were horrible and I couldn't stand more than a small spoonful.  Way to close the meal out on a low note Aureole!  I took the slow elevator ride up and got the hell out of there!\n\nDo I need to say it?  Go somewhere else!"

And food extremely disappointing..  \nMaybe it was an off night or something, but neither the food nor the service redeemed itself by the end of the night..  \nThe Amuse was not so amusing..  Some cauliflower soup thing that had no wow factor whatsoever..  We both had the foie gras appetizer which had way too much going on and the flavors just did not do it for me..  I mean foie gras is foie gras..  I love it in any preparation, but c'mon now..  \nThen I had the Escolar, which is a fish that a adore!  Every time I have had it, it was so yummy and buttery and this time it was grilled, but completely overcooked and so dry and unseasoned it seemed..  I only had a couple bites and could not even bring myself to eat any more..  Yes, it was that bad..  MM had the Salmon and he let me try a bite of that and I thought 'Eh...'  I make better salmon than that...\n\nAnd what's the deal with that ridiculous electronic wine tablet!?!  \nI mean, what are they paying the Sommelier for?  We tried several times to have them get rid of it and they finally got it out of our way after saying so at least 3x...  So needless to say, the servers were extremely inattentive..\nFor dessert we shared the Artisan Cheese plate and there 7 or 8 different cheeses and they plopped it down in front of us with no explanation of what they were..  We tried to get someone's attention..  Anyone.  Nothin..\nSo we decided to just have a go at it and I tried to guess myself what cheese was what..  It was ridiculous..\nFinally after a long while, we flagged someone down and \nthey were like..  'Your server did not explain your cheeses?'  \n'Uh, no, not at all...  Hello, a little attention here, please!..'\nTo top it off that person, was rude as well..  Not to mention the fact that the servers were too busy cleaning up and putting chairs and tables away, that we felt like 'the door couldn't have hit us faster in the ass on the way out' to boot..\nLuckily the company was great, because the experience at Aureole was a complete disappointment.."

As some people know, this is the establishment with the wine tower in which beautiful women hang from pulley systems while retrieving wines selections for guests. It's ambiance is quite pleasant, and helpful for guests who may be hard of hearing as the noise of the casino floor is deafened once you descend into the restaurant. Swans swim in the fountains outside and apparently for $10,000 you can have the swan for dinner and receive two complimentary down stuffed pillows of said swan if that's your agenda. The food is artful, creative and innovative and diverse tasting menus are also sometimes available. I recommend the lamb shank and the french onion soup and as far as desert and coffee go it's some of the best in the city. The service here is also attentive and professional. Overall this place is a wonderful spot for a lovely date night or a large Christmas party, just bring the wallet because as they say, \"you get what you pay for\"."

Since he was paying, I didn't argue :-) (about $80/person).\n\nIt was fantastic.  Eclectic mix of flavors and things I didn't think about before.  Each course featured a key ingredient, but then prepared in 2 different ways.  It was a great way to sample the Chef at Aureole.  \n\nIt is hard to describe the type of cuisine in this place as based on some of the things they serve you'd argue it is Latin flavored...but it didn't really have a cuisine signature.  Don't let that stop you though...there is something for everyone.\n\nIf you like wine, this is the place with the tower wine rack.  They have the 'wine angels' (which I think should be called Wine Ninjas based on what they wear) who get on wires and pulleys to get your bottle of wine down.\n\nThe one thing I didn't like was the photographer.  Some random lady came to every table taking pictures.  For the type of place this was (and prices) that was unexpected and a bit annoying.  I thought I was in a fine dining place, but then I was temporarily transported to a vegas splash mountain camera experience.  Then she comes back with pressure to sell them.  Again, just odd and out of place for a fine dining experience in my opinion.  Our host was gracious enough to buy the pictures for us, which was nice, but I felt he shouldn't have had to feel that pressure.  Note to Aureole: ditch the photographer and let people enjoy their conversation and dinner."

I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner at Aureole while visiting Las Vegas and the wine vault and the food are nothing short of incredible!!!\n\nDirections: To begin, the restaurant is located in Mandalay Bay. To get there, enter in through the main doors and continue to the left of the casino. Upon entering you'll find a large glass wine storage vault extending 3 floors. Follow the spiral staircase around the wine vault and check in at the front desk.\n\nAmbiance: Really nice but very classy and casual. The wine vault is really amazing and you can watch as a gymnast/ trapeze artist/ waitress ascends and descents hoisted by a wire harness to retrieve your wine.\n\nFood: My group opted to order the 8 course parallel pairing with two bottles of wine. Roughly our bill came out to $120. The meal was... incredible. Dinner was served in 4 courses where each contained a unifying ingredient prepared in two vary different ways. As I expect the menu regularly changes, briefly some highlights were: Corn chowder with a ginger sauce, blood orange salmon gravlax ricotta lobster ravioli, and a grape a goat cheese tart. All were amazing and to be able to taste how a single ingredient could be prepared in such different ways was wonderful. Needless to say, we were all very full upon completing our meals and were very content.\n\nWine: The wine collection is extensive.\n\nHappy Eating my friends. Stay hungry!"

The dining area is nice--it is contemporary and elegant (with white tablecloth) and there are big windows that provide a view of the outside greens.\n\nIn terms of the menu, there are two tasting menus (a seasonal tasting menu and a parallel tasting menu, which presents a primary ingredient in two separate preparations on the same plate).  There is also an a la carte menu (with some nice sounding dishes).\n\nI had the parallel tasting menu because it sounded like an intriguing concept.  There were definitely bright spots, but there were also some average to below average courses (from the concept not being great to begin with or poor cooking of the ingredients and thus not yielding the appropriate flavor/texture).  Here is the rundown on the tasting menu:\n\n(Roasted baby beets, tangerines, herb cheese, bourbon maple syrup) This dish was good.  I really liked the flavorful and juicy beets as well as the creamy and lightly tangy cheese.  The tangerines were just okay (not as vibrant as they could have been).\n\n(Golden beet panna cotta, cured salmon, tangerine lace) The golden beet panna cotta was creamy and did have a mild beet flavor.  The cured salmon was okay in terms of flavor, but I would have preferred more freshness and moistness.\n\n(Diver scallop, white asparagus and scallop terrine, wild mushrooms, asparagus, yuzu froth, trout roe) I thought the scallop was good.  It was very fresh and moist and had a good outside sear (though it was a tad salty).  A lot of times, froths/foams taste of nothing, but the yuzu froth here was surprisingly strong.  With the slight saltiness of the scallop and the strong yuzu flavor, this dish was not as light as it should have been.\n\nThe asparagus terrine was okay--I was not a fan of the gelatin-like texture and I thought it kind of tasted of nothing.  The garnishes of wild mushrooms, roe and asparagus were fine.\n\n(White asparagus, crispy Serrano ham, black peppercorn gastrique) I like how white asparagus pulls apart like green onions and these were a good representation of that (nicely cooked).  The Serrano ham was crispy and salty.  Like the scallops, I felt this dish should have been lighter in flavor.\n\n(Roasted Niman Ranch pork tenderloin, wrinkle potatoes, grilled baby leek, romesco sauce) This was a very below average dish.  The pork tenderloin was visibly overcooked and it was quite dry.  The sides and romesco sauce were not bad (the wrinkle purple potatoes were nice and tender), but they were not great either.\n\n(Pork sausage, crispy rock shrimp, steamed bun, cucumber salad) This dish seemed way too close to its Asian/Vietnamese basis.  The flavors and fragrances were okay, but I think you could get a much more flavorful and fragrant dish at a good Vietnamese restaurant.\n\nThe only element that really stood out was the crispy rock shrimp--very moist but also a light and crispy outside.\n\n(Ginger beignets, poached strawberries, lychee sorbet, lime rind) The ginger beignets were very disappointing.  They were filled with a ginger custard.  And because of this, the kitchen had to probably chill the beignets.  Unfortunately, the beignets were not evenly warm.  They were half cold, which was disappointing (especially when you think beignet, you think something hot, light and fluffy).\n\nThe lychee sorbet was cool and refreshing and I really liked the lime rind (small but very strong in flavor).\n\n(Coconut ginger vacherin, braised pineapple, vanilla Chantilly, meringue) This dessert was okay.  The vacherin was creamy and cool.  It was filled with pineapple and there was more of a pineapple flavor than a ginger flavor.  While I thought the dessert was kind of a standard dessert, I really liked the braised pineapple (sweet and not too tart), which looked like ginger.\n\nThere was also an assortment of below average complimentary bread.\n\nIn terms of service, the food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.  I thought the female servers were more personable and pleasant than my main male server (who was still polite).\n\nFor a fine dining place with a notable chef backing it, the price for their parallel tasting menu was not as high as other similar Vegas spots.  The food was disappointing though and given the lack of quality, it felt overpriced.\n\nAureole may have once been a good fine dining spot, but I am not sure if you can get a great meal here now.  If there was more attention to detail (and better cooking/preparation of the ingredients), you might be able to get at the very least a decent meal here.\n\nAureole is located in Mandalay Bay (free parking structure)."

Unfortunately, our waiter had not tried any of the dishes we were considering and was of little help to us in making choices.  The other staff were far more helpful, and ensured our evening was enjoyable.  The wine list is very extensive but way overpriced.  Look carefully and you can get a few excellent wines that won't kill the bank account (under$100). At first our order came out wrong and was immediately rectified.  The food was good but sparse.  The duck fat fries (we just had to try) were excellent but at $14.00 for a handful of fries way too expensive.  We were comped a free dessert due to mix up earlier and settled on the cheese platter.  Overall it would probably be a 3.5, but gave it a 4 as 3 would have been too harsh.  We enjoyed ourselves and that in the end matter most!"

            "review": "Sadly, I must add to the apathetic reviews after my dinner at Aureole last night. Not because of the service, which was not excellent but also not terrible, nor because of the wine program, which  lived up to its reputation overall, but because in the end the food was just okay, and what is a great restaurant without great food?\n\nService was actually pretty quick, though very \"entitled.\" What do I mean by that? Lots of assumptions were made all night. For instance, just after my first course, I was asked if I wanted any more bread (I had already tried one roll). I replied, \"Not right now,\" which evidently prompted the server to clear my bread plate, knife and butter. It would have been proper (and polite) to ask first. Lots of little details like this all night surprised me, given the (formerly) stellar reputation of this institution.\n\nThe food was good, but not great. I wasn't starving, so I just went for the 3 course menu -- corn chowder, cioppino and cheese. The chowder featured a tiny crab cake in the center of the dish, which tasted very fishy and was dried out from overcooking. I also had to pull some corn gristle out of my mouth, which is always gross. The cioppino had almost no flavor. Seriously. I put salt on it, which helped, but honestly it looked and tasted like someone had poured a thin tomato broth over 4 (count them) clams and a few unidentifiable pieces of fish. I could have gotten better cioppino at any seaside diner in California. The cheese was fine, albeit I received one TINY piece of three cheeses in total. I do mean small, and I do mean only one piece. Very stingy.\n\nThe wine program is obviously very extensive. That's what made this restaurant famous originally, and that's why I wanted to come primarily -- to see the \"wine angels\" make their ascent up the wine tower. Sadly, though many patrons around me ordered bottles, no angels ascended. I can only assume the bottles are stored somewhere else as well? Bummer. \n\nHowever, on the plus side, I did enjoy my wine selection and service. I opted for a 2008 Christian Moreau Chablis 1r Cru Vaillons, which was $90. A lovely Chardonnay, which paired well with the chowder in particular.  One of a few interesting bottles on the long list priced below $100. Wine service was well executed and prompt. My glass was always filled at the right time and with the right amount.\n\nIn the end, a spotty meal with a few highlights. I wonder if Aureole will be retired or re-vamped? One or the other should probably happen soon."

            "review": "Was so excited to visit this restaurant on a recent trip to Vegas and it fell short of all our expectations. The sommelier and the wine was excellent and we loved the appetizers, hence the two star review. However, the service, main entrees, and desserts were horrible and we would never return.\n\nWe went with a party of 8 for an early Friday night dinner (6pm) because we had a show at 9:30 and wanted to savor the wine and food. The restaurant was basically empty and they sat us at a table right next to a room with a large wedding reception going on. I politely asked our waiter to reseat us right before the water was poured since there was no dearth of free tables and he had every excuse in the book for not reseating us (\"Oh, they're just taking their seats, it'll quiet down soon.\" \"We can close the doors a bit.\")\n\nI couldn't hear anyone at opposite side of the table, so I pulled the waiter over again and told him we wanted to be reseated (\"But you have the best table here!\") or else we'd be leaving. On second thought, we should have just left and gone to one of the other restaurants at Mandalay Bay since we basically had a great experience at every one we tried. Finally we were reseated at a much better table. Finally.\n\nWe were appeased by the appetizers and wine. I had four oysters on the half shell that were served with lemon horseradish and tabasco. Yummy. I also had a small plate of a peach and cheese tartlet that was delish. The Caesar salad a dining companion ordered was \"deconstructed\" and looked cool, but tasted bland. But an order of yellowtail served with kiwi and watermelon puree was excellent.\n\nWell, the main star of Aureole was the wine and its computerized wine list (given on an iPad type device) and the \"wine fairies\" that are suspended in a wine tower and retrieve your choices. We enjoyed a peppery Chilean Malbec and a buttery Napa Chardonnay that were delicious and enjoyed by the entire table.\n\nI wish we had just ended the dinner there because the main entrees were a huge disappointment. I ordered the entree of tuna and veal which was stone cold. I sent it back and it was obvious they just microwaved it becuase the tuna (which was ordered rare) was now barely even pink. The sauce it was served in was salty and overpowering I sent it back again and they offered me something else, but by that point, my stomach had turned and I didn't want anything else. Steaks at the table were fine, but not worth the $40-50 pricetag and not as good as The Palm or another high-end chain. Two dinners got the tasting menu and were not impressed either.\n\nDesserts came out and one called \"chocolate decadence\" basically had a little chocolate tart the size of a half dollar coin. We laughed at how ridiculous the dessert was since it barely looked chocolatey and didn't ooze chocolate like you'd expect.\n\nTo their credit, Aureole tried to make it better, though I could tell that the waiter was sullen and pissed off. They gave us $100 off the bill, gave us three plates of ice cream (which was chocolatier than the decadance) and a bottle of pink dessert wine that was unbelieveably good.\n\nSo there you go. If you go, go for apps and wine in the lounge. You'll get the same ambiance, good appetizers, and the same wine list."

It's most recognizable feature is the two story wine tower that is the feature of the entrance way. If you're lucky you'll see one of the servers gliding up and down fetching wines ordered for tables down below (pretty sure out bottle was not one of them). The space is nice and elegant and even smaller than I expected. We were seated at a nice semi circle table with very high backs as to give the sense you're in your own space. I really liked the format of the menu - everything was prix fixe with lots of choices. We each selected a starter, a main course and two sides to share, as well as two desserts. It's a lot of food, well priced and amble choice. The service was top notch and we even selected our bottle of wine from an old school looking tablet (probably one of the first places to use?). At the end of the day we had a very nice meal but my biggest gripe is that the flavors over all were not outstanding or unique. There were a few bites here and there that were great, but if you took away everything else that made it \"vegas\", it would be a pretty ordinary food experience. I would recommend it for a safe bet for a good time with reliable food everyone can enjoy, the special vegas experience, and all at a good value and service. I would not go for an exquisite foodie experience or something extraordinarily different. A nice option to have the quiver.\n\nThey started us with an amuse bouche of three little bites: grilled cheese thing, egg roll and small piece of meat on a stick (I really don't remember the details). Our first course consisted of a yellow fin tuna poke composition and burrata and copa salad. The tuna was nice but hard to compare to the Poke we ate in Hawaii. I liked Erica's burrata salad more than she did because it had a nice kick with the bloody mary granite sauce. We both went with steaks for dinner - mine a NY strip loin with Peruvian smashed potatoes and chimichurri sauce, and Erica had the blue cheese crusted filet. The steaks were cooked well and nicely seasoned, particularly my strip with the exotic flavors of south america. I preferred Erica's more traditional filet preparation and certainly did not need my entire portion. Our sides were garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The potatoes were very creamy, garlicy and tasty but I wished more of those characteristics were found in the spinach. Finally for dessert we each ordered a sampler option with many little tasty treats. Aureole is a fun Vegas dinner that doesn't make or break any rules. Standard food with a great experience at a good value - can't go wrong for a special night out."

It looks like something out of Mission Impossible, but I digress. The decor is very modern, walking in, you hear it's quite loud. Loud as in a formal dinner, not bar loud. So, I began to think, romantic? Was I steered wrong by the 'hounds at Chowhound? As we were greeted, the hostess said, two for the Swan Court, this way. That's when we were whisked into a more remote part of the restaurant. The room was darker (lit by candles on the tables) and alot quieter than the main dining rooms. We also were sat next to the French Doors that open out to the garden where Swans are joyfully swimming near by. Romance factor galore! \n\nFood - We had the chef's tasting menu which was a seven course meal with appetizers, middle and main courses, wine, and dessert. Aureole's menu looks like it changes from time to time. I do remember it was really tasty. It came in courses (small plates), but I was surprised that I even got full (I'm a eater and can eat, so being full from small plates is a plus). The food was really, really good, but it didn't seem to be as enjoyable as Alize. \n\nService - Just like Alize, very attentive, not overbearing.\n\n$235 and some with tax, tip. If you want to be romantic, choose the Swan Court as it is away from the rest of busier (louder) dining rooms."

He seemed annoyed when Blair asked for the other menu, and said he had to tell us about the real one first.  We actually had 2 waiters, and the other one (tall and handsome) was the guy who checked on us, our drinks and our food most of the time.\n\nI ordered the frisee salad with poached egg, foie gras and figs for my first course.  Blair got the braised octopus and Maine lobster salad.  We definitely nibbled at each others.  I was very pleased with this course since it has everything great in it (and frisee is my favorite lettuce!)\n\nNext, I got the crispy duck leg confit with greens, super thin potatoes and ice wine reduction.  Blair ordered the braised short rib and seared togarashi tuna loin with broccoli puree.  We agreed the tuna was blah, but the duck and beef shined.  I also liked the veggies on my plate.\n\nWe ended up both getting the peach brown butter tart for dessert and the peaches were good but the tart a bit dry.  They bring itty bitty petit fours at the end and I tried all of them!  We also tried to get the wine pairing mentioned on threesquare.org.  The waiter taking our orders said the wine pairing was mistakenly put on there but charities do not allow alcohol to be advertised or some BS.  Blair pulled up the web site on her iPhone but he said pairing the wines listed would cost us up to $80 each instead of $10 or $20 extra!\n\nWe ended up getting wine flights for $14-16 each, a better deal and plenty for me.  I had the aromatic white (the RIesling was amazingly fruity but dry) and Blair enjoyed the ripe soft red and especially the Grenache.  I also indulged in enough pretzel rolls for both of us since she is low-carbing it.  After all of this indulgence we went to Wet Your Appetite at Wet Republic!

The menu is interesting and diverse, and I haven't yet had anything that I just didn't like.\n\nAs would be expected, the wine list is expansive, and takes the form of a tablet PC so that diners can make their selections from a live database of inventory and the wine angel can go fetch it if it's not behind the bar.\n\nService is attentive and gracious, with elegantly attired staff swooping in and out delilvering bread, clearing plates, refilling water, etc. You get what you pay for, of course. One doesn't get out of Auroele for less than a Ben Franklin per person, maybe more depending on beverage selections.\n\nAnd be prepared to invest a few hours.

            "review": "Having never visited either of Charlie Palmer's Las Vegas restaurants, but having enjoyed the cooking of Chef John Church at three different venues since becoming a resident, it was with great excitement that I entered Aureole ay Mandalay Bay with a friend to check out a brand new concept, Chef Palmer in attendance throughout the evening but the menu itself very much the work of one of Las Vegas' most respected local talents.\n\nLong considered one of the city's most eye-catching rooms, the expansive dining area spreading out behind an enormous wine-vault where 'angels' rise upward to snag bottles throughout the night, \"Aureole 2.0\" looks to reclaim relevance through renovation in a city where many would simply blow-up the idea and rebuild from scratch, the prices and ideas still 'fine dining,' though the menu format has shifted to a small-and-large-plates format with sections divided into root, surf and ranch.\n\nDining at room's center, the space quiet until approximately eight o'clock when several larger parties were seated almost simultaneously, it was with carte blanche given to Chef Church that the night unfolded, Chef Palmer stopping by each table several times to make sure all were enjoying dinner while the MGM Vice President of Dining Operations was also in attendance throughout the meal.\n\nAdmittedly known to Johnny, both present at the table having enjoyed dinner with him at 35 Steaks + Martinis earlier this year, it was with VIP-treatment that the meal got underway just minutes past 6pm, a bright herbal Cocktail suggested by the server providing a refreshing way to start as course one included housemade Bread service plus two Vegetarian plates, the Mediterranean trio a great choice for sharing given its classic flavors and large portion while the Raclette Fondue is an equally sizable 'must-order' with a creamy pool of Cheese spread beneath crisp Vegetables from the Intuitive Forager.\n\nPresenting two Salads before progressing to 'surf,' the Beet Salad par for the course while a made-to-order Caesar was upgraded from great to exceptional by way of a liberal tableside shaving of Black Truffles, it was at the recommendation of a young female Sommelier that plates five through eight were paired to a crisp yet fruity Riesling, Chef Church's Lion Fish Ceviche making great use of the invasive with light spice and bold aromatics while the raw Kampachi was beautifully painted with Citrus alongside pickled and earthy flavors.\n\nHaving seen a similar Beef and Octopus preparation at The Hard Rock, this version equally good but essentially no different save for the plating, Aureole's Crab Roll was unfortunately in desperate need of some Salt to highlight the mild ingredients, a follow-up trio of Chicken Oysters, a Potato Raviolo and Gruyere-stuffed Meatballs suffering in no such way as both the tender make-shift Peirogi in Tomato Sauce and the IKEA-inspired orbs bested their ethnic counterparts by several degrees.\n\nUnknowingly not yet at the half-way mark, a total of twenty-five menu items sent out during a four hour stay, plates twelve and thirteen offered Palmer's Saffron Risotto chock-full of fresh Seafood alongside a $110 Sea Bass, the mostly-deboned fish presented whole with crispy-Skin up beneath a spritz of Lemon and spoonfuls of piquant green Sauce.\n\nContinually treated to flawless service, drinks promptly filled and plates cleared as finished, heavier Meats found themselves complimented by a glass of 2012 Chateau de Beaucastel, the Sheep Ricotta Tortellini amongst Sin City's best Winter dishes with Duck Confit and Parmesan Emulsion ready to carry the Black Truffle aromatics while the White Asparagus dish does similar with a bit of spiciness and the richness of one of Artisanal Farm's intense yellow Eggs.\n\nPleased by the Ribeye, but wowed by a Christmas Special of fork-tender Veal Wellington and golden Bread Pudding that would be well served to join the menu in full-time form, another stunner from the Root menu was the Vegan-friendly Roasted Spaghetti Squash dotted in Beets, Nuts and Pepitas with a pleasant top-note added by crumbles of non-dairy Truffle 'Cheese.'\n\nAt this point wishing one or two more guests would join the table, a short break and some Espresso thankfully providing a bit of time to digest, Dessert was no less a show than the savories leading up to it, the artisanal Cheese selection or Brie, Cheddar and Blue-Cheesecakes perfectly-tailored to wine-centric patrons - with the latter really quite special - while the Crostata and Tart tended more classic; a Foie Gras Martini referencing Chef Church's time at Andre's as the Coffee Panna Cotta provided the perfect combination of silky texture and mild sweetness at the end of a meal that redefined decadence."

The service was great without being overbearing, the decor was modern but it didn't look very fancy, and the food was pretty good. If you like wine you'll probably like this restaurant.  You order wine off of the electronic wine menu, there's the famous wine tower inside the restaurant, and they have wine pairing with the food. \n\nWe ordered the 3 course and 4 course pre fixe meal.  The 3 course meal was pretty basic: a light salad, beef on top of mashed potatoes, and a banana dessert. What's nice is that the portion size was large and I was full at the end of the meal. The salad and beef were pretty good, but the banana dessert was delicious! I'm not a dessert person and this is the only dessert I can say I ever loved! The 4 course had 2 dishes per course, the presentation was nice (but I didn't try all the courses).  \n\nOne thing to note is that the executive chef does not work on Mondays."

Their wine list is also computerized - they give you something that looks like an iPad rather than a paper menu.  The ambiance is nice and the food is good but nothing wowed me. However, our server Ronaldo, left much to be desired as we found him to be brusque and somewhat rude.\n\nWe came in using a gift certificate from Restaurant.com, so maybe that's why we got shabby treatment.  Obviously the restaurant is in need of new customers, which is they they had the certificate offered on Restaurant.com to begin with.  My friend ordered a glass of wine (Chardonnay - $12) and I drank tap.  After we ordered our entrees, the waiter asked, \"And for your first course?\"  A more diplomatic way he could have asked if we were ordering appetizers could have been, \"Will you be ordering anything else?\"  I found it to be pretty rude and pushy to assume we would be ordering appetizers.  Sorry, but since when is it expected that you order a certain amount when dining out?  I would have tipped him much less than I did, except that we were waited on by various ppl, so I assumed they shared the tip and I did not want to stiff some of the others who were quite nice (the bread man, the man who refilled our glasses).  We were also largely ignored after our entrees came.  No one asked how our dinner was and we had to wait at least 10 minutes after our dishes were cleared to get dessert menus hastily thrown at us.  As a result, we did not order any dessert due to the treatment we got.   I noticed the table next to us did not get serviced very well either, even though the guy ordered a $200 bottle of wine.  However, I did notice that someone asked them if they would like to have their picture taken, and they declined.  No one asked us if we'd like our picture taken!!  \n\nAs far as the food goes, the seafood is fresh but I doubt it's sustainable.  The scallops were succulent and large; my black cod was tender.  The corn succotash was good but not $8 worth.  I think it had like two beans in it - they call that succotash??  I loved the bread!  I got the pretzel bread (my favorite) and some bacon tasting bread, which was also good.  \n\nI won't be back, with or without a coupon.  Aureole should really hire nicer waiters or at least train the ones they have better."

On top of THAT, the options SUCK.  I was so glad to see that the amazing French Onion soup was still on the menu so we ordered just that.\n\nAt $9 for soup, it wasn't even a great deal...I'd have a hard time paying $9 for a small cup of soup anywhere...but I really wanted to love this place still.

The manager who checked on us towards the end of meal was also very friendly.  The sommelier was GREAT and helped us pick a bottle we both really enjoyed from their electronic wine list (which was fun).  We couldn't see if they sent the wine angel up to get it because we weren't seated near the wine tower.\n\nWhich brings me to where we were sitting.  We were seated in the \"Swan Terrace,\" although we did not request this and I wasn't too familiar with the fact that there were different \"areas\" at all.  Now it's kind of cool that there are swans, but the room comes with restrictions on what you can order.  Most importantly they don't even offer you the a la carte menu--you have to order a three course meal. We were both thinking about a tasting menu anyway, so this wasn't a huge deal.  But my guy had seen their advertisement outside the restaurant for the three course \"Harvest Menu,\" which is made with fresh seasonal produce, and he wanted that.  When our server came over, we asked why it wasn't on the menu, and he said it was only served in the \"other\" dining room.  When we looked surprised, he said he'd get it for us, but made it clear he was doing us a favor.  I found this altogether bizarre--if you're going to place restrictions like that, why not warn patrons first?  Why not offer them a table in the \"other\" dining room as well?  The restaurant was not full, so it seemed like they were trying to force us to order from only the two most expensive tasting menus.  Also, afterward, I looked at their web site, and apparently we paid MORE for the exact SAME food just by virtue of our presence in the swan room.  And at no point did we REQUEST swans or even have the swan option explained to us. \n\nNow, having read some reviews, I see that there are supposed to be little swan-based extras, but we didn't see any of that.  I saw other tables getting an amuse bouche, which we were not served.  Also, our actual server kind of put a damper on the whole evening because he was just pretentious.  We're really friendly diners, but he could hardly spare a smile and paid us as little attention as possible. Shouldn't you put your friendliest (or at least, your least snobby) waiter in the special swan room? \n\nNow, the food itself was beautiful and delicious.  Charlie Palmer knows how to put together a menu.  And the quality of the food explains the Michelin Star.  I had some delicious butternut squash ravioli with brown butter and snow crab.  We both had steak dishes.  And the desserts were pretty and yummy.  And we enjoyed the blueberry margarita from the bar as well as the wine.  I did think it was a little weird that they circulated the bread on a tray but didn't bother to heat any of it up.  But because they put bacon INSIDE their focaccia, I won't quibble.  \n\nA few days later, after considering our whole Aureole experience, I don't think we'll be repeat visitors.  It's a very expensive restaurant to begin with, so you want to have a good memory there.  And I just can't help feeling taken advantage of with the whole swan business.  And when your waiter is snotty to you, it doesn't matter how nice everyone else is or how delicious the food is. It really just kills the evening."

The concept of \"wine angels\" sounded really cool and, online, the menu looked really good. While the restaurant is certainly elegant and upscale, the service was terrible. We ordered wine from a massive and confusing electronic list of wines brought to the table by a person believed to be our waiter. However, after waiting about 30 minutes, we still had no wine and had to flag down the bus boy for more water, as well as finding someone to tend to the wine order. The appetizers were good (I ordered a cheese plate); however, they would have been complimented by wine. When our wine finally did arrive, it was brought by a completely different server, and our waiter was no where to be found. \n\nThen our entrees arrived, one of which was not what had been ordered. Once the correct plates arrived, they were delicious, but our experience was already tainted. We were never able to order more wine, and never received more water. In fact, the only person who was attentive was the woman who brought around bread. Although we were given a complimentary dessert (a plate a small cookies), it paled in comparison to the poor service. I've received better quality service in a truck stop. Though the food was good, for the price we paid, the service should be top quality as well. And while the impressive tower of wine is cool, we saw one wine angel the entire night. Totally overrated."

To start the dinner off we had their complimentary artisan breads, my personal favorite being the bacon bread (yummm!!!). I decided that the first courses looked more exciting than the seconds, and as we usually do, just ordered 4 things to share: Onion soup, Lobster Cappuccino, Wild Mushroom Risotto, and Roasted Butternut Squash Ravioli. The first course of soups was perfect. The lobster cappuccino was the front runner (I literally wanted to lick the bowl clean), and the onion soup was good but couldn't compete with the lobster. The wait for our second course was kind of long, which our waiter apologized for- and comped us dessert and espresso's, but after our first bite of both dishes neither of us cared about the wait. Both dishes were magic! The complexity of the flavors was astounding. I think my date and I looked at eachother with disbelief several times. Sadly, even though we shard everything, we couldn't finish it all (which I felt really bad about considering how deelish it all was). The espresso and gelato were great as well, but the two second course dishes will sit in my memory until my next foodgasm :)"

Their sorbets are to die for. Very fresh, delicious, and so many choices!  I went there for a special occasion and they provided excellent service. When they learned of my special event celebration, they even provided additional sorbets for tasting. Love love love the service here. Will definitely recommend :)"

            "review": "This was the most disappointing restaurant my husband and I ate at in Vegas.  First came the bread, which was clearly not fresh (maybe a day old?) and the butter they served with it was cold and hard - straight from the fridge.  For an appetizer we decided to split the fresh king grab leg and red crab fritter.  What came out was two small pieces of crab, it could have been snow crab for all I know, topped with some tobiko and an aoili and two small pieces of basically a mini eggroll of crab.  I tried to be optimistic thinking they'd pack a lot of flavor, incorrect.  In fact, quite flavorless.  Next the entrees - my husband ordered the 24 ounce porterhouse and I ordered the herb crusted lamb.  The porterhouse was chewey - he gave me a few pieces and the new york strip portion was just bubble gum, the filet portion was pretty decent but couldn't compensate for the cheweyness.  He asked for a steak knife, but they said the knife he had was the right knife, he had a lot of trouble cutting it and kept mentioned hands hurt through out the meal because of how tough the steak was to cut.  The herb crust on the lamb was actually pretty good, but other than that it was just average.  Throughout the meal my husband kept noticing they kept putting our silverware in front of us improperly, which seemed strange to us.  I was still hungry after the lamb, so we ordered dessert.  I got the molten cake and my husband ordered the creme brule (the special that day).  These were very good, and the only reason I gave 2 stars, but you can't really screw up dessert - can you?"

Comments you would hear during the meal from each of us include \"This is the single best bite of pasta I have ever had\", \"The octopus is the most expertly cooked octopus I've had in years.\", \"The orange mousse is the most surprisingly good dessert, I can't stop eating it.\"   My personal favorite bites of the night were the lobster ravioli, pork belly pasta, goat cheesecake, and that caramel mousse!\n\nAn absolute 5 start dining experience.

But the crab ravioli. God that was so good. \n\nSquab paired with pan seared froie gras.  God. so good.  The froie gras was so perfect. one of my eating companions had a near orgasm over it, much to the chagrin to the rest of the table.  But inwardly....yes, it was good.\n\nThe filet mignon was seared to near perfection, and with the shepards pie.  yummy!  And with a bottle of nice red, the food kept getting better and better.  the dessert, not too found of. \n\nSort of neat, as the Chef came out to the table and talked a little bit with us.  Nice guy, sort of quiet. Not the personality you would think that a Chef would have.  I've alwasy thought of kitchen industry to be a foul language, rough and tough gang, with tattoos, chemical dependence and possibly a rap sheet......\n\nFood! Great! Would I go again.  Yes.....Damn, vegas has a lot of great places to eat!!! only so little time, and not enough stomach space.  And an added plus, that L'atelier didn't have....a really hot waiter.

This may not be an appropriate way to begin a review for a nice restaurant, but then again Aureole is not a nice restaurant.  The service was about as bad as possible.  From the sneaky upsell to the \"Swan Room\" to the short and non-descriptive descriptions of each course by our waiter to the mind-numbing half hour wait between each of the seven courses, I really cannot decide what was the worst.  Actually, I will tell you what was the worst, that the food was mediocre, for an old person's palate, and made up entirely of low-cost ingredients.  As ridiculous as the entire experience was, I tried to bite my tongue so the birthday people could try to enjoy their night.  But at the end of four hours (we were told the tasting menu would take 2 1/2 hours.  Did I mention there were only seven other groups in the entire restaurant on a Friday night?) We gladly paid the 160-200 each person and got the hell out of there, all of us laughing hysterically that a Restaurant could be so hyped, so over-priced, and so horribly awful.  Well, at least we had a sense of humor about it."

We arrived and we ordered the Valentine's Day special, which was clearly made prior to Vday as it all tasted old, and very below average, especially for $105 a plate. The first course had cashew pur\u00e9e which tasted rotten and sour, as did the vegetables included in it. The second course was risotto and it tasted like cardboard and was over cooked, and hardly even warm, I would feed that to my dog, much less my boyfriend. The third course was a Wellington that was under cooked, the pastry around it was still very raw and doughy and the meat tasted like the smell of dog food- I had one bite and pushed my plate away, as did my boyfriend. When asked by our waiter if everything was ok, my response was \"No, to say this meal was disappointing would be an under statement\". Our waiters response was an odd look, as if he didn't understand, walked away, and returned with our dessert. Our dessert was rock hard frozen, and we couldn't eat it, until we sat there for 20 minutes waiting for it to thaw out- and still wasn't very tasty. After waiting for 30 minutes to get our waiters attention, he finally returned with our $300 bill. WORST experience, a very embarrassing Valentine's Day surprise, and a complete waste of money. And to think the waiter didn't even apologize or requests a manager to attend to us. Don't waste your time or money."

The setting is initially very impressive, but it gets somewhat odd upon further inspection as you can kind of see a hotel employee entrance on the bottom level (not hidden too well).\n\nThe food and service is what you would expect given the prices.

Since we were there we decided to try Aureole for dinner.  \n\nThe GOOD- \n1) The location and scenery were great! The 4-story wine tower is incredible to look at and fun to watch the ladies in their \"Mission Impossible\" suits go to get the wine bottles.\n2) The food- read below for more information\n3) The service was as good as I've had at a fine dining establishment.  From the lady serving bread, to the man who took our order, to the Sommelier who recommended a nice bottle of wine.\n\nThe OK-\n1) The restaurant is a pricy place to eat.  It was over $300 for the two of us.  But I guess you have to expect that in Vegas!\n2) The wine list is quite cumbersome so if you are like us and aren't the smartest when it comes to wine, it's hard to pick one.  We're both fans of the red wines, especially Zinfandel's from the Dry Creek area (Healdsburg, Sonoma County) and they didn't have many wines from that region to choose from on their list.\n\nThe FOOD-\nWe both ordered from the Chef Vincent's Market Menu. The Salt and Pepper Calamari has got to be some of the BEST I've ever had.  It didn't need any dipping sauce and the calamari pieces were perfectly lightly breaded so that you could taste the calamari, not just the breading.  I had the seared Rainbow Trout and it was good.  I wasn't a fan of the skin being served along with the fish, but I ate around it and the fish was really tasty.  The white asparagus was overcooked for my taste, but the whole dish itself was prepared well and seasoned good.  My boyfriend had the American Wagyu Beef Skirt Steak and he LOVED it!  There was nothing left but an empty plate when he was finished.  For dessert I ordered the Salted Caramel Bomb cake and my boyfriend had the Orange Grand Marnier Creme Caramel.  Both desserts were great, but my favorite was the blood orange sorbet served with the Creme Caramel.  It was to die for!!!\n\nWe also ordered a bottle of 2007 Joseph Phelps Cabernet Savignon that was really good! \n\nOverall, our experience at Aureole was awesome.  Hopefully we will be back to enjoy another great dining experience!"

They (we had 2 servers) came out with wine and cocktail menus first (maybe hoping we'd drink too much so that we wouldn't notice how slow the service was).  After finally getting menus and ordering, we were served a nice selection of breads.  When the food came out, everyone got their entrees except me so we nicely asked the waitress to check on the order for us.  When the waiter returned with my swordfish, he said that the reason they didn't bring my dish was because we had switched seats and the servers sent my dish back when they saw food already present at my original seat.  I couldn't decide whether he was just presenting an excuse or being accusatory, but I wasn't sure why they didn't just ask me if that extra entree was mine since I didn't have any food in front of me.  After I started to eat my fish, I was very impressed with the way it was seasoned.  However as I started to get to the middle of the filet, I noticed that it wasn't fully cooked.  So I asked the waitress if this type of fish was supposed to be served this way and she claimed that it was how the chef liked to prepare it, but if I wanted to she could take it back (hubby and foodie then tells me that swordfish is supposed to be fully cooked).  So after getting my fish back, I was only able to eat the outside parts because the middle was still not cooked.  At that point, I was full on the mini vegetables so I didn't ask for them to try again.  I was thinking that they would get a 1 star rating from me, but sadly I must confess that I can be easily bribed with desserts.  The waitress had seen my disappointment (and uneaten fish) and said she would send out some sorbet that is made in house.  She ended up sending out sorbet and ice cream and I found them very light and flavorful!  Voila!  They gain back a star!  \n\nSo, the final say is...If you're a wine drinker (which I'm not), you would probably want to try it for that reason because their selection is pretty vast.  Not to mention the gimmicky wine faeries are fun to watch as they fetch your order.  Otherwise, save the $120-200 for the slots because who knows, you could get to spin on the wheel of fortune machines or win Megabucks! ;)"

            "review": "Dined here a couple of nights ago. Was in town for a conference and restaurant was recommended. We had a 915 reservation. Of course when you have a wine collection as expansive as this one it is quite the spectacle. The decor and ambiance is very nice as well. But for me, that is where the fine dining experience stopped. \n\nThe entire night was thrown off starting with before dinner cocktails. The table ordered two manhattans that came and were so far from manhattans they could have been called San Diego's. I make a very good Manhattan and have no issue 1) telling you what's wrong with yours and 2) how to make it the right way. I asked the waiter to ask the bartender what they did because it was so far off and the answer was far from what I tasted the difference was. At any point they did not charge us for the drink that I would not take more than half a sip from and then made a much closer to regular Manhattan that clearly showed the first drink was made without focus. Although, the second was closer, it was weak and so small it was ridiculous. \n\nThe restaurant mgr (at least I think that's who he was) came to take our order. He was wearing a suit where our waiter wore a vest and tie I believe, was in my opinion rude. He rushed our appetizer order. Rushed our food order and at no point was capable of providing a pleasant experience.  For example, there were four people in our party and his recommendation for an appetizer was three small ravioli. Which our waiter told us would not be good for us and provided another suggestion which we had him change to. \n\nOur waiter was nice, although his knowledge of the menu was questionable. He made good recommendations but when we asked what the side car dish was with the steak his answer was \"the chef changes it every couple days, I don't know\". You would think at some point he would ask the chef and answer the question. \n\nHonestly I could go on and on about the food and how mediocre it was. I ordered the bone in rib eye. Don't hate me but I like my steak medium well plus. The waiter said he would order it well but the chef would not dry it out. Well, it was very dry. It was served on these steel type plates/trays. Which was cool BUT. A cold steel tray will make a cold ass steak. A cold ass steak becomes a dry ass steak (and I'm not trying to say aged). We ordered roasted Brussel sprouts that ended up being steamed Brussel sprouts. The mushrooms were meh. I would send a picture of my steak but it wasn't picture worthy. I did take a picture of my friends chicken stuffed with crab. But you'll see there's no chicken and it wasn't finished. The other two dishes were rib eye medium rare which the person loved and the osso bucco which was tender. \n\nThe desserts were okay but not my speed. \n\nI can sum this up best by saying a picture is worth a thousand words. If you look at the pictures from years ago in yelp from this place and anything recent. I feel you will see a drastic difference. Before the food was inspired, now the food is uninspired and tired. Maybe it's time for a change.  Anyone can have a huge wine collection in the Mandalay bay to get people in. But in 2016 in Las Vegas there are too many great experiences for dining to be had to perform the way this place is currently performing. If it wasn't for the ambience and the wine tower (which in this day and age the wine angel thing is played out, it should be automated if you ask me) I would've given it a one. That would be based on food, presentation, service and professionalism."

We had heard several reccomendations for the chefs parallel tasting menu and that was what we went with.  First off, yes its expensive at $85 per person plus an additional $55 for the wine pairing, but its worth every penny. The parallel is a four course tasting that has two dishes per course, so it's almost like an eight course tasting.  Our favorite was the pan-seared diver scallop on a braised short rib with carrot puree and trumpet mushrooms...we would have paid the $300 for just that dish! The wine pairings were exquisite and given that they have 150 pages of wine to select from, if you didn't like what was on the parallel menu, you would be able to find something. \nWe did not sit in the swan court, opting instead to watch the wine angels, which are way cooler than swans, though the atmosphere isn't quite as romantic.  Our wait staff did an outstanding job. They were very attentive, happily answered questions, and were never intrusive.  As long as you know what you're getting into price-wise, aureole wont disappoint."

The somellier with his iPad device of wine to order from and there when needed if you have questions or need to be topped off.  We had a waiter to explain the menu and take orders.

When we checked in upon arriving, the hostess told us that it will be about a 5-10 minute wait. Convention people were in the hotel and so it was a reasonable request. Well the time passed and so I was going to inquire as to the hold up. When I was about to, they gave us an indication that our table may be ready and we were finally going to be seated. Unfortunately they told us to wait longer as there was no table because of the convention. Well, one would assume that restaurants in Vegas would be aware of conventions and anticipate the amount and rush of people each night and manage accordingly, especially one as highly regarded as this restaurant. Again, we were wrong to believe it. \n\nWe saw people being seated before us and they arrived after we checked in for our reservation. I was livid and told their hosts in certain terms that they ruined our special night and we were just going to leave. Another staff member intervened (didn't know if she was the manager because she never said her name nor told us who she was) proceeded to explain that they don't have a table available because of the circumstances. Their excuse made it worse because why set the reservation if they couldn't accommodate and we specifically said in setting this dinner reservation that it was for our anniversary. We could have chosen other fine dining establishments but we chose this restaurant based on the accolades and high ratings. Again we were proven wrong. Finally when we made a decision to just leave, they somehow found another table. BTW the table we requested should have been in the Swan room but we didn't get it. We should have left because further lame attempts and excuses should have warned us.\n\nWell the appetizers we ordered, the glasses of wines, and my main dish were good, however my wife's main entree was not. After being seated and after the 40 minute fiasco, one would think that we will now be given a good experience - once again, we were proven wrong. Overall the service was spotty and the experience left a bad taste and bad memory. Based on our terrible experience and the monies we shelled out to pay for this dinner - be forewarned. I should not give them any star or if I have to, it will be a half-star."

It's a typical higher end steakhouse with pedestrian dishes, not very big portions, and served at higher price which is normal for most any and all Las Vegas Resort Casinos.  \n\nOne thing we noticed is outside the restaurant entrance podium they advertise a 3 course meal for $55.00 but once you are seated inside their is no mention of this special anywhere on the menu nor do the servers mention it when being served.  When we inquired about it we got the feeling the server was not interested because of his response to us was very vague and his body language just says he wasn't interested.  It was pretty funny.  Note to Aureole management:  Take down that 3 course meal advertisement at the entrance podium if your aren't interested in selling it to your patrons once inside. It kind of comes off as a bait and switch tactic if you get my drift.\n\nWhile the service was okay, the ambiance seems a little dated here (late 1990's early 2000).  The wine tower and wine angel is kind of a cool gimmick.  The restaurant wasn't that busy and makes one wonder how long they can stay in business for.  Charlie Palmer closed his South Coast California location last year and gives me the feeling that he is tired and disinterested in keeping his locations and food updated.  Sigh..."

Three really handsome men approached me and asked if they could buy me a drink. \"Each?\" And before I thanked my lucky stars I tried to explain to them I wasn't in the service industry, because they might have had the wrong idea. By the time I finished that song and dance in a way as to not cause embarassment for any of us, their table was ready.

Those three were there for a bachelor party, figuring why not just keep the group small and go really big. I became a mascot.

I had little knowledge of the restaurant, it's cuisine, layout, etc... except that it sat across from the China Grill and that it housed a multi-story wine cage/vault... (basically a large glass encased storage tower you might imagine would hold... government secrets, DNA, or some kind of supercomputer... in a James Bond/Austin Powers/Mission Impossible kind of scenario--- but in this case, it was wine.) We traversed down a seemingly endless set of stairs that wrapped around the cage and arrived at the bottom to be greeted by the host. She offered us seating in either the main floor or the Swan Court. We chose the Swan Court. It was much quieter, more intimate. We sat by a set of double-pane glass doors that looked out onto our own private patio area overlooking a small Swan-filled pond. The interior decor throughout was very simple, but modern-  lots of earthtones, glass, clean-lines and height. We were then handed a PC tablet listing their wine selection (impressive), by servers dressed in full suit & tie attire (odd). Combine the decor with the technology and the server attire, and you can see why it felt as though we were in GATTACA (and feeling slightly underdressed). Nonetheless, the servers were extremely attentive, professional and knowledgable about every aspect of the dining experience... So far we've gone from 2 choices (main room or the Swan Court) to 10,000 choices (wine) back to 2 choices... either the 7-course Chef's selection or a 2 course pre-fixe menu... we chose the 7-course to taste a bit of everything, even after being warned it might take as long as 2 hours to get through the meal. Three hours (and several $$$$$) later, I found myself pleased with the whole experience and highly recommend it for a special occassion or after winning big at the tables."

I am a very patient diner, so that is something that I would almost never do, but that's how bad the service was. \n\nThe place is also laid out weirdly. The best tables do not even have a view of the famous \"wine angels\" so we opted to sit in the main dining room which was nothing special, and we did see 1 wine angel, but she was not as graceful as I would have hoped."

This time we sat in the main dining room which offers a stunning view of the wine tower. We saw a couple angels fetch bottles. But otherwise, I much prefer the intimacy and extra level of service experienced in swan court.\n\nWe all ordered wine by the glass, the husband and I ordered of the menu and BIL chose the market menu.\n\nCombined we started with clam chowder, onion soup and the pear tart with duck proscuitto. While nothing was outstanding, all three whet our appetite and we were ready for more.\n\nThen for the main course we had Waygu skirt steak, the rack of lamb and the scallops. The steak had fantastic flavor, but it was very chewy, likely due to the cut of meat. As good as the flavor was I couldn't help but think it was like beef flavored bubble gum -- tasty while you chew, but you don't want to swallow it. The scallops were huge and nicely prepared, but the vanilla apple compote was simply too sweet for my liking and I thought it completely overwhelmed the dish. The star of the meal was the lamb. Rich and meaty, just plain delicious. I also ordered ratatouille for us to share. It was very good. \n\nThe dinner was good, but it should have been better. We left pretty disappointed."

Their electronic wine menu was interesting to experience once.\n\nWe got free dessert and that was good. Six pieces of bite-size mystery desserts to split among four people. I like their silverware. Couches were VERY comfortable. I got their $4 Illy coffee (a small cup) and it was surprisingly good - better than Starbucks. I would have totally forked over another $4 for another cup.\n\nWould totally recommend for wine affectionados. I'd maybe go back to try their dinner. Just maybe."

The first course and wine selection was actually ok. Not great, but not bad either. It was funny watching the wait staff playing with wine list on the iPad. And the bread was tasty. \n\nThen, the main course happened. Everything arrived cold. The medium steak, the potatoes, the pasta, the cooked purple kale. Cold cold cold. I guess the reason the food took so long was they were waiting for everything to cool off. They offered to microwave everything for us, but that didn't seem right. \n\nSo if you have to come here, just order small plates like cheese or soup and NOT the main entrees."

Maybe, I'm not overly emotional, unreasonably dramatic, or fail to exhibit the cliched passion that comes with the warm fuzzies. Possibly, it's because I'm not googley eyed and in love and have yet to demonstrate the depths of true love. That may have all changed after my exceptional experience at Aureole. I'm in love with Aureole. \n\nI can now rant and rave and become emotionally obsessed with the rich and decadent life that I could lead with Aureole. \n\nEver had a meal so good you think that you're going to faint from the deliciousness? Ever tasted something so good you literally had that elusive foodgasm? Not an easy feat, but damn you Aureole, I'm seriously sprung off of what you have serving up!\n\nFirst, let me just set the scene here. Mom, Susan 1 and I met at Mandalay for dinner. I had just come off my high of beating the house and I was ready to celebrate. We went to Strip Steak first and seeing that they had an hour wait, I remembered that incredible wine tower and boom! Dinner at Aureole was coming to fruition. We walked down the steps that curve along the wine tower-a pretty cool sight-down to the check-in stand. I wasn't in any condition for fancy dining-but it's Vegas-if you got the money, they got the goods. We were seated at a lovely table by the window. The sommelier came by and we ended up with a great bottle of Pinot Noir. Let's jump into our tasty meal.\n\nCavier-Russian Golden Ostera served with toast, finely chopped onions, egg white and yolk and cream. Delicious-salty, briney and heaven with every bite! Let me just say that when I ordered the cavier, our server told us that they were out. Seeing the slight disappointment in my face, he excused himself only to come back a few minutes later and said he was SENDING someone to get my cavier from another restaurant on the property. WHAT?!? \n\nRoasted Butternut Squash with Succotash-Smooth, nutty and just spectacular! The succotash with arugula was so good!\n\nRoasted Chicken-served with black truffle jus-need I say more? The skin was crispy without sacrificing the moistness and flavor!\n\nRoasted Pork Chop with roasted tomatoes-Large portion, filling and well flavored!\n\nDuo beef filet with skirt steak-I like my steak medium rare-it came out the peerrrfect temprature and practically melted, and I mean melted in my mouth!\n\nCreamy Spinach Au Gratin-Susan's favorite! A great side-definitely very rich!\n\nParmesan Fries-and dare I say I tasted some truffle oil in there? \n\nDessert Sampler-Strusel Baked Apple-Yummy. Who doesn't love baked apple? It's the ultimate comfort food. Salted Caramel Bombe-Wow! Salt and sweet definitely go together here! Warm Molten Cake-I'm no chocolate lover, but I was giddy about this! Macaroon Tea Creme Brulee-a very different taste but surprisingly good!\n\nTasting of Pumpkin-Spiced pumpkin cake, chocolate ginger pot de creme, honey caramel lollipop. All amazing!\n\nAs if that wasn't enough-our lovely waiter, Jose brought us a large sampler of their sorbets to wrap up the night. The food was heavenly but it doesn't stop there. I don't hand out 5 star reviews just for anyone....\n\nThe great food is just like great sex. Really satisfying and fun but probably won't keep me coming back unless there is some depth....And, like I said, I'm in love with Aureole...now let me tell you why....\n\nOur waiter, Jose was outstanding! Knowledgeable, warm and inviting! He not only brought us the sorbets but after drinking our bottle of wine-he brought me another glass of Pinot on the house! I told him how amazing our night was and thanked him for the experience. He then offered to give me, Susan and my mom a tour of the kitchen and to meet the chef!\n\nWhat? I didn't even know that things like this happened! My mom is currently in culinary school and the very thought of seeing the inside workings of one of Charlie Palmer's gems was something we could not pass up! Charlie Palmer of course wasn't there but we did get to meet Chef Vincent who was not only very accommodating but welcomed us in his kitchen! He even posed for a few pictures with us. He allowed us to take pictures of his kitchen and we sat and chatted for a bit. He even signed the menu and wrote  a small note for my mom. My mom's excitement was priceless-she is extremely passionate about her culinary studies and the look on her face was worth every single penny I spent at Aureole. \n\nTo sum it up:\n\nFood-5 stars\nWine selection and the\"angels\" that grab the bottles-5 stars\nService-10 stars (it's my review, I can give 10 stars)\nAmbiance and experience-100 stars\n\nThank you to Aureole! I love you! Thanks to Jose and Chef Vincent as well!"

Nice walkway with a long staircase down.  You get to appreciate a glass wine tower on the way down.  People actually get tied in and fly around getting bottles.  Pretty cool.\n\nAfter Bouchon and Olives I was hoping this place was going to rock.\n\nSome reviews have complained about the bread but it was great when I was there.  Clearly fresh.  The focaccia was AMAZING.  I had three pieces.  \n\nWe got the $85 Palmer tasting menu.  First round of duets was crab based.  Both were awesome.  Plenty of flavor.  One reviewer commented on the papaya not being ripe but I think that's the point.  I'm not going to get too detailed on the flavor, but I'll just say both dishes work and are decadent.  Awesome stuff based on my Michelin experiences.\n\nSecond round of duets was salmon based.  I think these rocked too.  Shout outs to the extremely good sauces and great sun dried tomatoes.  They really stood out.  Better than anything I can get in fine grocery stores.\n\nThird round was some wagyu and diver scallop.  Scallop was perfect.  Wagyu was very flavorful and accompanied but some awesome mushrooms.  One reviewer commented it was very tough, but from my experience some of the greatest cuts of beef are very tough.  This isn't filet mignon.  The meat was very flavorful and the sauce was amazing.\n\nDesert was a bunch of different things.  Didn't blow me away.  However the sorbets were interesting.  The cantaloupe one was great.\n\nAll in all I think I'm starting to like Charlie Palmer more and more.  \n\nI would definitely go to this place again.  This joint would survive in NY, which is certainly not true of plenty of Michelin star restaurants out here."

What I do remember was the meat duo I had -- it was a short rib with a piece of filet (I believe) and the sauces were very complimentary, but it wasn't something I'd expect from a restaurant of Aureole's caliber.  The beef duo at Chaya was much much better -- and that's saying something.\n\nAll in all, the atmosphere was great and the service was spectacular (it was also awesome that the wine list came on a tablet), but the food just didn't live up to the standards I had set.

We started in the bar area for happy hour which was the best part of the meal. We both had a drink and one appetizer. We had the french onion soup and the sliders, both were great. After we went to the main dining room where we ordered the pork chops, some sort of seasoned fries (not sure what kind because they never came), and a caesar salad. The caesar salad was very marginal because they tried to make this salad \"fancy\" but it was really just a pain because they just put three lettuce leaves on a plate with a little dressing and some cheese... I just wanted a salad. Like I said, the fries never came out and he didn't even realize so I didn't say anything. The pork chop was a pork chop... nothing to get excited about. For desert we ordered the chocolate sampler which was so weird. It came with a chocolate mouse with popcorn in it which was not good at all, a chocolate cake pop which was so dry we couldn't eat it, and a little churro with chocolate dipping sauce which was good. Also, when we ordered the desert I ordered a coffee which came out after we had already eaten our desert so I sent it back. For as \"fancy\" and over priced this place is I expected a little more... at least try to remember to bring out the food I ordered?"

I love to read/research/pick out restaurants and we chose Aureole because we wanted to try the pre-fixe menu and we both liked the various choices. We arrived about 30 minutes early for our reservation so we spent some time shopping. We arrived at the restaurant promptly and were taken to our table but the hostess didn't ask to take our coats (it was windy that night) or our bag. Once we arrived, we were seated at one of the banquettes and I put my purse next to me along with my coat. The waiter came over and picked up my friends things and put them on the other side of me - totally made me feel hemmed in. Again, I should have asked for coat check but he should have as well. I had the restaurant.com coupon and let the server know we were using it as well as ordering from the theater menu and that we'd like glasses of wine (I like whites, my friend likes reds). That pretty much ended our service from him and his assistant. They took our order but after that, a waiter from a different section took care of us until the time when the bill was presented. We never got the chance to look at the electronic wine menu and our meals were just so-so. They were adequate but nothing spectacular. I've eaten in restaurants with better reputations where they actually make you feel like you more welcome. Maybe it was the waiter, maybe it was the restaurant, maybe it was me, but I know I'll never go back to Aureole.  Utterly disappointing culinary end to a great vacation!"

We sat down and received an overview of the extensive wine list (handily kept on an ipad) and were presented with the four story wine cellar managed by \"wine angels\" who fly up and down to retrieve your selected bottle(s).  It's stunning.  First, don't listen to folks who \"dropped in\" and sat at the bar.  This place deserves the respect of making a reservation and sitting down for the experience.  Get the tasting menu.  It was $85 per person, and had four double courses, each playing off their own theme.  For instance, course one was \"foie gras\" and had a hot and cold prep.  Very non-traditional preps as well, not just seared and terrine.  \n\nLet me back up though... our REAL first course was the foie gras chicken and waffles.  Are you kidding me?  I prefer not to swear in reviews, but WOW, this was f-ing amazing.  Perfectly seared foie over crispy chicken skin, a waffle, and dark meat bits of succulent chicken.  I could have just ordered three more portions of this with a bottle of sauternes and been happy as hell.\n\nAnyway, after the chicken and waffles came the first foie course, which was amazing.  The second course was a play on squash, the third was a play on \"cheek\".  On one side, we hade grade A5 kobe beef cheeks with some tenderloin and on the other side we had cod cheeks.  Remarkable.  The final course was a play on peaches.  A perfect ending.  \n\nWine pairing was $55 in addition to the $85 tasting fee.  You will not leave hungry, and the wines were truly paired very well.  I've been to Vegas over 50 times and always wanted to eat here.  Now it will be on my list each time I go."

The sleek open space is punctuated by the 3 story wine tower, home to nearly 10,000 bottles  (a fifth of their overall inventory).  This version of Aureole is far different from the small, intimate original in Manhattan's Upper East side, but in Vegas, bigger is better.  Visuals are great and all, but how is the food?  Excellent.  Chef Charlie Palmer's \"progressive American\" focuses on dishes of high-quality ingredients simply prepared and presented.  The menu is straightforward, either choose the 3 course prix fixe or the 7 course \"Celebration of Great American Food\" tasting menu.  Selections are mostly seasonal, although consistent on the menu are the \"Peking\" duck and Colorado lamb, both very good.\n\nAureole is home to one of the largest and diverse wine lists one will ever see.  Over 2,000 selections and 50,000 total bottles, the list is presented electronically on a wireless tablet PC.  There is an initial \"wow, this is cool\" upon seeing this, in practice it would be best to have a good ol' analog (paper) wine list.  Although I am usually too proud to ask for help selecting a bottle, there is simply too man options here.  The sommeliers are incredibly knowledgeable, and I suppose they had better be with an inventory such as this.  I would prefer to see a better by-the-glass list.  Unless you get the 7 course meal, with the wine pairings, your single serving options are rather limited."

I know that you can essentially get free alcohol in the casinos, but when you want to enjoy some of the appetizers during happy hour, some alcohol will add to the appeal!\n\nMy friend and I ordered the trio of cheese platter which had brillat savarin, goat blue log, and beecher's flagship reserve from Seattle, WA. It was paired with a honey comb, onion jam, and candied walnuts. They, of course, served it with a platter of toast. Delicious!!! I highly recommend this platter!\n\nWe also ordered the cilantro hummus with pita chips. I liked it, but cilantro was pretty dominant so if you can't stomach the taste, I wouldn't recommend it. Our waiter/bartender was very knowledgeable and nice. We had two servers--an older gentleman and a younger gentleman--the younger gentleman was our server and was very sociable and answered our questions. \n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the happy hour prices and meals that was offered at this place besides the gorgeous wine tower that is on display."

Always wanted to try a Charlie Palmer restaurant, why not here?\n2. Had to see the famous wine tower.  One of the seven wonders of the world, you know.\n3. Had to pick a fancy restaurant that fellow Yelper, Cynthia C. hadn't yet dined at in Vegas (not an easy task, as that girl's done some professional-level eating in this city).\n\nSet a date\nSet a time\nStarve yourself.\n\nThe Mandalay Bay Resort never fails to amuse me.  It's like a benign tumor that just keeps growing and growing.  I hadn't seen it in awhile, but the sheer size of the facility is impressive, even by Vegas standards.  Aureole is nestled in their restaurant row amongst some fairly ornate facades.  \n\n**Aside, walk by Rum Jungle or Red Square and you'll never never be the same again...**\n\nIn stark contrast, the entrance to Aureole seems almost spartan in comparison.  The view changes dramatically once you're inside and staring at the four-story steel and glass phallus they call the wine tower.  It's a pretty impressive beast, and definitely the center of attention.\nThe main dining room softens a bit as you're surrounded in rich, dark hardwoods, white tablecloths, and leather chairs.  This is probably a deliberate attempt to distract diners from that large tumescent mamma-hamma wine tower...\n\nOur table went with the special Riedel Anniversary tasting menu that night.  Wifey and I had to forgo the vino due to alien/parasite problems... but that's another story.\n\nThe food, however, was spectacular.  Highlights of our evening included a hunk o' otoro tuna that was otherworldly, and just about the best bison we've ever sunk our teeth into.  The flavors were almost enough to distract me from that monstrously engorged wine tower of verticality.\n\nConversation at the table was lively and electric.  The ladies looked terrific, but my mind was obviously elsewhere.\n\nWifey: \"It was so sweet of Aureole to make a substitution for one of my dishes, don' t u think, sweetie?\"\nMe: \"Damn, did u see the size of that tower?!?  That's one hella tower!\"\n\nWifey: \"Don't u think Cynthia C's dress is really cute?\"\nMe: \"Yeah.  How many bottles do u think they can fit in that tower?  Shazam!  That thing's huge!!!\n\nIn the end, we had a great time, with delicious food and wonderful company.  My only regret of the evening was not being able to witness  the lovely wine angels glide up and down the shaft of that tower...\n\nYou have a dirty mind."

            "review": "For my 30th birthday, my wife and I decided to check out Aureole. We wanted to go somewhere fancy and just (over)indulge our senses. We chose the Swan room, where diners get the occasional glimpse of swans swimming past the windows. \n\nFrom the moment we arrived, everyone who worked there was extremely welcoming and friendly. We received pre-meal appetizers as we tried a glass of wine, and all of it was delicious. The dining path we chose was the Parallel Tasting menu, and boy were we pleased with our decision.\n\nI tend not to try new foods in restaurants, especially when it's pricey. This night, however, I was determined to expand my culinary horizons and explore these dishes with an open mind. I'm thrilled that I did this.\n\nWhat You Get With the Parallel Tasting:\n\nFirst Course\nYUZU MARINATED LOBSTER TAIL   \nARTICHOKE VEGETABLE SALAD AND BASIL AIOLI\n\n-AND-\n\nLOBSTER AND SWEET CORN FRITTER   \nKUMQUAT CHUTNEY, BEAN SHOOT SALAD\n\nALBARINO, IBERIAN REMIX, CENTRAL COAST 2008\n \nSecond Course\nOVEN ROASTED SEA BASS   \nPUMPKIN RISOTTO, SAGE BUTTER SAUCE\n\n-AND-\n\nSEARED SWEETBREADS, PUMPKIN FIN TART   \nPUMPKIN SEED OIL VINAIGRETTE\n\nPINOT NOIR, AMBULLNEO, SOLOMAN HILLS, SANTA YNEZ 2006\n \nThird Course\nGRILLED WAGYU BEEF STRIP LOIN   \nWILTED TATSOI, MARINATED ENOKI MUSHROOMS\n\n-AND-\n\nBEER BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIB   \nAPPLE-SHALLOT CONFIT, BACON JUS\n\nCABERNET FRANC, ROBERT SINSKEY, VANDAL VINEYARD, CARNEROS 2005\n \nFourth Course\nTOASTED ALMOND TORRONE BOMBE   \nCHOCOLATE CANDIED NUTS\n\n-AND-\n\nCARAMEL ALMOND TART   \nDARK CHOCOLATE ESSENCE\n\nEISWEIN, KRACHER, AUSTRIA 2008\n\nThe food and drink was extremely pleasant, the tablet used for wine ordering was great for us techies, and we saw the swans all night. What truly made the evening, though, was the outstanding service we received. Everything came to the table precisely when we wanted it. Having worked in food service, I can tell you that this takes a very attentive and coordinated server. We were never short on water, the food was always the right temperature and no dirty dishes remained on our table for more than a few minutes after we completed our courses.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend Aureole (and the Swan room) for any couples looking to enjoy a romantic evening filled with mouth-watering food, awesome wines and a relaxing ambiance."

Second you are served a run of the mill bread assortment COLD! I agree with a previous poster, cold bread is a joke in a fine dinning establishment.\n\nOk onto the food. I can make this very short and to the point, UNEDIBLE! We sent back every course except the the white truffles risotto. The rest of the food and I mean all four courses because even the second choices the manager had made for us to try and compensate for the disastrous first course was horrible.  \n\nA total disappointment and nauseating experience. Anybody who rates this as great food has no idea what great food is and no way has eaten at Roubocon or Guy Savoy. \n\nDo not waste your money."

A couple of pushes with the spoon into the delicious foie gras and truffle infused soup and the dish actually seems more like my everyday French Onion Soup, except there were lots of little crunchy pieces of the caved in dome. I finished the last bits of soup off with two of the 5 breads that are offered by the breadboy (I went pretzel bread and cheddar/walnut). Delicious, my coworkers got the romaine lettuce which looked totally underwhelming, but I guess thats what being healthy is all about.\n\nThe Filet was cooked perfectly medium rare, witha  nice and pink center and a good char to the outside. The bleu cheese was very creamy, with just the right amount of delicious chunks to give every bite a kick. I dont know if it was the knife that was so sharp, or the meat was so tender, but it was easier to cut through the steak than it was to cut the butter knife through butter at the table. Each bite was so juicy and delicious...I'm pretty sure this was the better steak of my excursion (beating out the KC Strip I had in Kansas City).\n\nThe desert was an apple turnover with maple iced cream, apple slaw and caramel spirals. SO GOOD! There were 3 small crispy rings of apple goodness which I topped with the apple slaw (basically stringline pieces of apple). The maple ice cream was a great compliment along with the caramel spirals (I crushed these down in order to get little flakes in each bite).\n\nThe bill for 6 people was about $550 including gratuity which doesnt seem unreasonable, considering the meal also included drinks.\n\nIt was also nice noting that this place isnt nearly as loud as many of the other Vegas restaurants I have been to. It's nice being able to converse with people across the table without repeating every sentence.\n\nI'd probably give this place 4 stars if I had paid, but thats because I'm a cheap jew and usually prefer holes in the wall."

Celebrity chef offshoots usually disappoint because the chef is never actually there and attention to detail suffers.  I know Charlie Palmer didn't cook my meal, or even see it, but the details are polished here and it would be hard to leave unhappy.  \n\nThe computerized wine list is so much fun for the oenophile that you should give yourself 30 minutes to find what you want to drink before you order.  Compared to other Vegas fine dining, you are given plenty of great choices/vintages under $100, or you can splurge from your winnings to spend much, much more.\n\nService is swarming, but unintrusive, and you shouldn't be surprised to have 10+ people be involved in your experience in the course of the night.\n\nI wasn't wowed by the food (though it was very good), but I was wowed by the experience.  Everything else was so polished, I would expect the food to be better the next time around.\n\nConsidering Joel Robuchon wants $250 and up for his prix fixe menus, Charlie Palmer's are a veritable bargain, both coming in at under $100.  Yes, it is a splurge night out, but other splurges in Vegas have been more expensive and less impressive."

But, how about some love and pride in your food and in the servers?

Unless you are some kind of snob that needs a private chef to yell at you should truly enjoy your experience."

It took us a good 10 minutes to figure it all out. My husband and I decided to share the prix fixe menu, which includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. We chose the romaine salad (Caesar), the bleu cheese crusted 8oz filet, and the chocolate trio for dessert. The Caesar salad was good but not spectacular. They put an anchovy on the plate which was a little too much for me. I like a hint of anchovy but not the actual fish! The filet was very yummy, especially with the bleu cheese. Sharing it was the perfect thing to do, especially when you get the entire three course meal. The chocolate trio was INCREDIBLE. Churro with chocolate sauce, mini chocolate covered ice cream pops, and a rich chocolate mousse. So good. At 5:30pm on Thursday they were pretty quiet. The best place to sit was in the back where we had a view of both the swans on one side and the wine tower on the other. They also have an awesome happy hour menu!"

There is also an upstairs cocktail area along the hallway inside Mandalay Bay, but we felt more like a bar experience than a people watching one.\n\nThe wine selection was EXCELLENT. I got a red flight and my wife got a white flight. The tempranillo and zinfindel in the red flight were great, and my wife said two out of her three white wines were excellent. \n\nWe also got an ahi tuna appetizer which gets an A+ for presentation and taste, but a B for quantity. They aren't huge or anything, and they come on a specialized plate designated for six pieces but instead give you four with the other two pieces on the plate garnished with avacado. \n\nWe also go the dessert sampler menu which I highly suggest for sugar-lovers out there. Everything from the Creme Brule to the Lava Cake was outstanding, and just enough for two people to share. We were going to pair the dessert with a Sautern, but the Sautern there wasn't very good, so we opted (on recommendation from the bartender) for an Ice Wine instead. The Ice Wine was AMAZING. \n\nThe service was also remarkable. It was pretty busy downstairs but the two men tending the bar were still personable and didn't rush us. We did get their fairly early in the night (about 6:30pm on a Friday), so the rush may not have come yet.\n\nAlso, another cool feature was the Cirque du Soleil-esque wine retriever. They have a four story wine rack that is great to look at and it becomes even more fun when you see a woman in a harness bouncing up and down to get the bottle you want. \n\nAll in all, this place would have been perfect if it wasn't for one thing: The prices. We got two sample flights of wine, an ahi tuna appetizer, a dessert sampler and two glasses of Ice Wine and the price came out to about $115 before the tip. I get that sometimes you are paying for experience, but I know I didn't get $115 in quality of wine.\n\nEverything else was magnificent. I was very impressed and may go back to Aureole again, but I may only get one or two items to keep down on the cost. \n\nExtra Note: While your there, and if you go before 9pm, walk down to the Shark Reef. It was a great experience and they do have discounts for locals. I thought it was going to be a small, crappy aquarium but it was actually pretty good sized and kept us entertained for awhile."

We ordered the Charlie Palmer Parallel Menu which is a 4-course menu but is served as a \"duo\". The tasting menu cost $85/person but we used a restaurant.com coupon for a better deal.\n\nIt made me really sad to see how they served bread here. They precut the bread and left it sitting out for hours. In this arid climate, the bread gets really dry and hard - especially the baguette. \n\nThe duo of crab came first: a crabcake with papaya and a crab/ahi tuna salad with thai curry flavours. The crabcake was okay but the papaya clearly wasn't ripe enough so it lacked sweetness. The crab salad faired better however texturally, it was a bit mushy for my taste.\n\nThe duo of salmon was my least favourite course consisting of a smoked salmon rolled in pasta and salmon on top of fennel with beurre blanc sauce. The pasta came out as a large clump of dough -  a total textural violation. The tomato sauce tasted like bad barbeque sauce. It was not good. Fortunately the salmon with fennel faired better but was definitely underseasoned and overcooked.\n\nThe final savoury course was a duo of scallop and Australian Wagyu skirtsteak. The scallop dish was done well and was well above the best dish of the night. The Wagyu beef however was tougher than some dried out jerky. Not to mention, it was real skimpy on the yummy sauce that came with it.\n\nDessert is usually a redeeming point with me. However there were definitely some timing issues with the preparation. The mocha lava cake, which had great flavour, was overdone and dry. The lemon/blueberry semi-freddo was nice but the bottom part that was supposed to be crunchy, wasn't. The blueberry financier was good but was a little too sweet. The best thing on the plate was the blueberry sorbet.\n\nService was wonderful and engaging. Our server got the wine angel to go up the tower so we could watch without ordering wine. He also comped us the mocha lava cake.\n\nNow if only the food could live up to the service, this place could have been wonderful."

They would not stop asking us if we needed help deciding. Kind of irritating.  We just wanted to read all of it and decide what to eat first. \nI decided on a steak. BIG mistake. It was indelible. I never send food back and this had to go. Especially for the price.  It was the worst steak I've ever had. The Cesear salad and tuna poke was good though. My husband had the chicken pot pie and it was fine. \nOverall there are way too many great restaurants in Vegas to go back there.  It didn't wow me."

Our sides of asparagus and mashed potatos were wonderful too...and the beginner bread basket is great. \n\nThe restaurant is known for its wine selection, so of course we had to try! The list is presented on a tablet that is hard to understand until the server helps you. Once we mastered the tablet and narrowed it down to about 10 Pinot Noirs, the head server Malik helped us select one that was FABULOUS. Since that dinner, we have actually ordered bottles of the same wine so we can always have it on hand!\n\nOverall, wonderful dining experience. The staff is helpful and quick.

We decided to celebrate by dining at Aureole, or the restaurant with the huge tower of wine.\nWe ate in the court in which you can see the swans swimming in the pond.  It's about $95 per person for a four course meal.  \nDinner:  food was ok.  I love food for starters, let me say this.  I love different flavors and such.  However, I wasn't too blown away by what was presented.  Don't get me wrong, the presentation was beautiful.  However, the food was so so.  The highlight was the beef tartare.  I thought that to be very delicious.  I did not care for either veal dish presented.  That was my least favorite.  \nThe dessert was a duo of white chocolate and dark chocolate with mango sorbet.   The white chocolate dessert was delicious however i feel the mango should have been left completely off of the dark chocolate dessert.  I love the bitterness of dark chocolate and felt as though the mango did not pair well at all with this dish.\nService:  I believe service could have been a bit more personable.  Our drinks were constantly refilled, but we barely saw our waiter except when being served our meal.  To his credit he explained each dish and what we were seeing--but I expected that.  What I was looking for we him to ask if everything was ok and if there was anything that could be changed--he only asked during the next to the last course. \nCocktails:  they definitely utilize premium liquor for these cocktails.\nAll in all, it was a lovely dinner that definitely could have been better.  Our anniversary night wasn't ruined however, I did have high expectations for the food and service, especially for the price they charge.  Probably will not come back but at least it was an experience I can say I had."

The french onion soup was quite good. The puffed pastry lightened up the dish instead of topping the soup with unwieldy amounts of gruyere cheese. Unfortunately my steak was overcooked. I ordered medium rare and received a steak that was almost medium well. The risotto was rich and decadent. \n\nThe boyfriend had the hamachi crudo, the filet mignon, and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The \"pudding\" is a light cake and was very flavorful. \n\nThe service at Aureole was the best that we've had on this trip to Las Vegas. (You can check out my other reviews to see the other Las Vegas restaurants we visited). Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and seemed to time everything perfectly. I find it very refreshing to have someone who takes the time to listen to us rather than rushing off to the kitchen or the next table.\n\nI should have ordered a tasting menu. The couple seated next to us had the parallel tasting menu and both of them raved about the dishes. I should have listened to THEM instead of the boyfriend who wanted an a la carte meal that evening. It's the last time I listen to him. Next time we're having the parallel tasting menu with wine pairings AND the sticky toffee pudding. ;)\n\nAs soon as I figure out how to post a picture to this review, I'll post a picture of my steak with the risotto with truffles in the background."

The decor is lovely, though it is on the verge of looking dated. The service, while thorough, was slow as molasses, but as I'd read the Yelp reviews before, I knew to expect this. That said, we never felt rushed, and ultimately got everything we needed. We scanned the menu and decided on the \"chef's harvest menu\" (I think that's what it was called?) which was a 3-course prix fixe menu of seasonal ingredients, costing $65. We weren't that hungry and we asked them if we could split it, and they generously obliged, even going so far as to plate the split portions separately without charging us a penny. We started with the arugula, strawberry, and rhubarb salad, which was delicious. We then had the halibut with risotto and some other delicious sides I can't recall. I thought it was ok, but my boyfriend loved it. My issue was that I had been completely ruined for Halibut by the Black Mountain Grill, who served me the most perfectly cooked piece of Halibut I've had in recent memory last week, so I was tough to impress. We finished with a chocolate spearmint bar topped with housemade whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream, served with a tray of 5 housemade confections that I think comes with every meal. It was tasty, but forgettable. All of this was accompanied by a generously poured $20 glass of Grappa, by far the best Grappa I've ever had, and well worth the price tag. (Though we split this, as neither of us wanted a whole glass). Overall it was a good value - we were stuffed, even having split a meal, and the tab was under $100. This is one of those times where I wish there was a 3.5 star rating on Yelp, because Aureole is better than 3 stars but not quite up to 4. I didn't find it overpriced at all and it was good value for the food, ambiance, plating and service. However, there is certainly better food in Vegas."

My only complaint is that there were several large parties there that night and it was loud and a little chaotic.  The waiter sensed my frustration and asked if they were being too loud.  I said \"no\" because I did not want to spoil their fun and I honestly don't think it was the fault of the party but the way the restaurant is set up.  This was my second time dining at this establishment and the service was much better the first time.  I attribute this largely to the fact that they had two large parties and may have been a little understaffed.  The specialty cocktails here are simply amazing and the desserts are so good that I would have been satisfied making a meal of dessert.  We will dine here every time we are in Vegas.

            "review": "Aureole is a tough review to write.  On the one hand, the food and decor is absolutely fantastic.  A very cool and romantic room to have dinner in.  On the other, unless you've won some serious coin gambling and are just spending your own cash, be prepared to walk out of there with a slightly empty feeling, like - that was really good, but was it several hundred dollars for two good?\r\n\r\nAs soon as you make your way through the casino to the door, you walk down a circular set of stairs around the most amazing collection of wine you will probably ever see.  I won't go on about this because others have mentioned it, but needless to say, it is indeed impressive.  (Guys, there is an elevator there that you should offer to bring your women down in - high heels and this stair case don't go so well together.)  Once we made it down, we were immediately seated. No table in the place seemed bad, although our table was positioned in such a way that one of us ended up sitting on the divider between two cushions, kind of like having to ride bitch in the back seat. Again, small nit, but one would think they would have considered such a thing in a meticulously designed space.\r\n\r\nWe ordered the 7 course tasting menu but selected our own wine (which you order off an HP Tablet PC.)  The staff were helpful and attentive and not snobbish at all.  Even the wine professionals were courteous and un-assuming.  We probably dealt with at least 6 or 7 people throughout the evening, each of whom brought out different courses and explained what they were.  The food itself was fantastic; appropriately cooked, displayed beautifully, and tasteful.  Dessert left much to be desired however; I suppose that's a risk you take when you are at the discretion of the tasting menu instead of being able to pick out your absolute favorite.\r\n\r\nAll in all Aureole was a great place to go and I would go back again, but there was just something missing from this place that won't let me give it 5 stars. The ultra-modern decor? The cushion thing? The dessert that was slightly off?  Having to drop multiple c-notes on a dinner?  I don't know - judge for yourself. It's worth the trip to Mandalay Bay but don't be surprised if you walk away asking yourself if it was really worth it."

            "review": "Food - Amazing. The food is absolutely delightful and this was one of my favorite meals in Vegas. I had the spring rolls which were placed in some sort of peanut sauce. They were tasty. I also had the kale with caramelized onions and bacon - amazing. Really this was one of the best side dishes I've ever had. It was big enough to fill me and tasty enough to finish the entire plate. The finale of this meal was absolutely divine. The chocolate trio. Go there right now and order this. First there is a small cup of chocolate fondue accompanied with fresh strawberries and warm hazelnut doughnuts. Deadly. They're just beyond phenomenal. Then there are chocolate profiteroles in the center surrounded by homemade toasted marshmallows and sitting on a fudge sauce. Heavenly. The third item, to round out the trio, is a chocolate ganache topped with caramel corn. I nearly died - it was just fantastic. \n\nService - Okay so I ate at the bar. Service was not the best - he forgot my first glass of wine so I got it after the reminder but then he never brought the second. The bartender also made me move my seat to accommodate another guest who never ended up arriving. So - very poor service overall. However, the bad service is worth the food :)"

We ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairings - which of course was the expensive thing on the menu.  This came with the best service we have encountered, ever.  Every glass of wine, or food, came with a different waiter.  Everyone catered to our every whim.  The food - however - was hit or miss.  I remember the monkfish being exceptional.  Somethings were strange, though, not to my liking.  Although as a foodie, I loved every minute of it.  The wines were interesting, and the entertainment value of the wine \"angels\" added to the fun aspect of the evening.  Overall, a wonderful experience."

You get to walk out to the courtyard at your leisure and see these beautiful white swans swimming about the pond. We had the dine Las Vegas prefixe and the full Parallel tasting menu. Everything we had was delicious, beautifully plated, and exquisite...the parallel menu items being a little bit better than the prefixe. The desserts and sorbets were to die for...the highlight of the experience were all the sorbets!"

From the tray-passed hor d'ourves to the main course and dessert, all the flavors were spot-on and I had nothing to complain about.\n\nThe food was stellar.

I originally booked for the Stripsteak however they closed earlier than what I expected! After searching the available fine dining options at Mandalay Bay I ran across this place. Booked a 10:15 pm reservation and upon arrival was greeted immediately as well as seated! The ambiance of the place is spectacular! No complaints at all a nice wine tower that greets you as your walking in and just WOW. The winding glass staircase is amazing and you just feel like you're walking into heaven sort a speak. The waiter we had was awesome customer service was great! He had strong recommendations as well as great hospitality! Now on to the food.. No appetiZers or drinks just went straight for the entrees! Colorado rack of lambs ($65) and the 18 oz ribeye ($63) my rack of lamb was excellent and I wanted to try something different but wow for $65 it sure was a baby lamb.. Skip the Mac n cheese for $12 it was AWFUL! I could've made a better batch at home from the velveeta box..The ribeye we ended up sending back because my partner said it was on the level of Outback Steakhouse lol and just the preparation and presentation of it was OFF! We are steak people so we know when a steak is being short changed and this one was terrible! So terrible that we sent it back with an exchange for a filet with a lobster to top it off! Definitely made up for the joke of a ribeye!  All in all not sure if I would return but it was fun to try out.."

Four courses with nice tastings of comparing contrasting delights!   \n\nThe entire experience felt elegant!!!   So glad I was able to experience this with my friends and my husband.   Bon Appetit!"

This is really fine dining at it's best. our server, Alfredo was professional and warm. Actually he was more than that. He really added an extra element of excitement to the dining experience. He was enthusiastic about the food and wine and just so pleasant to be with. Yet he didn't hover or bug us. He anticipated our needs and was on point. \nThe food was spectacular. We had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing. The portions and timing of the service was perfect. \nI usually skip dessert but we were presented with 2 of the most amazing desserts I have ever tasted. The bananas foster creme brulee  and a chocolate duo that I don't remember the name of but will never forget the taste of. Best chocolate ever."

The service was great, very attentive and had a nice demeanor. I had the macadamia nut crusted scallops with beets and my boyfriend had the crab stuffed chicken and we shared a side of mushrooms. The portions were just right for both of us and I loved how the mushrooms came with big chunks of roasted garlic. I had a graham cracker s'more dessert with chocolate and marshmallow spread. I see what people are saying about the \"stuffy\" atmosphere with the type of people I saw dining there but it didn't affect my experience. I was so excited to see the wine Angels go up the tower and being the wine! The wine tower is amazing to look at you get a great view when using the stairs as opposed to the elevator."

However, the food and wine we did have was fabulous, reasonably priced, and well delivered.\n\nThe waiter, with help from the sommelier, recommended a great pairing with my sole, though I forgot to take note of the name of the wine!\n\nFood portions were perfect.  Not too dainty, but not so massive that you cannot finish your entree and your hors d'oeuvre.  My wife had the halibut and I had the sole.  Both were perfectly cooked, came in great sauces and had great side vegetables.\n\nThe restaurant and lounge did seem pretty empty for a Friday night at 8pm, but that was fine by us.

If I had seen that the food and service were so up and down, we wouldn't have paid the price.  \n\nTo start with, they should have a regular written wine list for people who don't care to go through the multiple menus on the I-Pad based wine list they stick you with.  Too much work for that time of night.\n\nWe each had a glass of wine from their by-the-glass menu.  Good, but not great wine.\n\nThey bring by a bread plate, and you can choose what type you want.  We had a roll with cherrys in it.  Tasted like a cinnamon-raisin bagel.  A little stale.  Also some wheat bread.  Meh.\n\nI got the french onion soup to start.  After the first one came out luke-warm and I had to send it back, it actually was amazing.  Instead of a soggy piece of bread and cheese floating in soup like you usually get, they made a pot-pie looking thing with crispy, cheesey top crust that you can break off with your spoon and dip in the soup as you want it.  Really good!\n\nI had the sea bass, and my wife had the pork chop.  The waiter tried to give me the pork chop.  Who can blame him?  No self-respecting guy gets the fish when there's a pork chop to be had.  Woops.  I had to send that back too, because it was bordering on cold.  My wife's pork chop was very good, with a nice smoky flavor, but as we shared it waiting for the fish to come back, we realized that hers was pretty cold too.  It just didn't matter so much with the pork chop. \n\nWhen the fish came (hot this time) I enjoyed it, but there was no WOW moment.  It was good fish on a pretty good rice base.  As we thought about it, the pork chop was pretty much the same.  No Wow.  Good, but nothing special.\n\nThe manager felt bad about our luke-warm food, so he offered us a free desert.  I was stuffed at that point, so I asked for a single scoop of sherbet.  They brought us four deserts!  I guess this was to try to make up for the lack of everything else, but it just gave us a chance to try all the deserts and realize that they didn't measure up either.  \n\nThe fried apple ring thing was pretty tasteless.  The Sherbet was good.  The cookie taster plate was - good, not great.  I can't remember what else they brought.  That should tell you how good it was.\n\nTo sum it up, the whole experience was...good, not great.  But expensive.\n\nI'm not recommending it."
