            "review": "I read some of the previous reviews, and it made my expectation too high, so in the end I was slightly disappointed.\n\nONE STAR DEDUCTION because my boyfriend made a reservation here to watch the Super Bowl, but when we got there, they said there's no reservation under his name, but thank goodness there were enough seats for us at the bar.\n\nI ordered the following (from the Happy Hour Menu) because they seemed to be recommended by previous Yelpers (:\n\n**Ramen in Tonkatsu with Pork Belly ($8+$2 for pork belly)  - Portion is small, didn't satisfy my hunger. In the ramen it contained two slices of pork belly which just tasted like regular lame pork. Soup and noodle was not bad, but I definitely had way better ramen. I probably would not get this again.\n\n**Thai Beef Salad ($10) - I thought it's in regular salad style, but it's actually four \"lettuce cups\" (see uploaded picture) . I would prefer regular salad style so I get more lettuce, but lettuce cups are pretty cool and fun to eat too. I really like the flavorful and juicy beef in the salad, and the dressing goes well with it. I believe the non-happy hour price for this salad is almost $20.\n\n**Kobe Sliders ($10) - 2 sliders with shoe string fries. The sliders and fries are both pretty good, but the portion of the fries is comparable to the size of McDonald's small fries. \n\nThe food was decently good but the portion was small. Our bartender was nice and friendly, and the ambiance/atmosphere was nice and cozy. If I ever come back here again, it would only be for their Happy Hour. The domestic beer is only $3 during Happy Hour!"

            "review": "Wow!  This place was so worth it.  Outside of LA, best ramen I have had, and that was unexpected for Vegas.  Or maybe I'm just going through ramen withdrawal.\n\nAnywho, Moscow Mule from the bar was also really good (considering most places can't make it or it just sucks).  Food was outstanding and service was great.  A little pricey but worth it.\n\nDan, our waiter, was awesome in getting us really good food through recommendations or his thoughts on dishes, great service."

He seemed unpleasant as if he didn't wanna be there or something and he showed that through his service. Secondly, the chicken teriyaki was over cooked. I felt that the place over all was a fun hip cool place to go to but something's need more attention."

            "review": "The service here was excellent!  I forget the young lady's name that waited on us, but she was extremely polite and helpful with the menu.  I would say the only downfall of this restaurant was the appetizers.  I ordered the edamame and although it came 2 different ways, one with sea salt and the other was a more spicy coating, it was just mediocre.  I actually found the soybeans pretty tough to get out of the pod, so I'm thinking maybe they were not cooked enough?  My husband had some sort of peppers for an appetizer.  Again, just ok.  Now...the sushi...fabulous!!!  We ordered 3 rolls and everything was superb!  The angry tuna roll is a must try!  If I were still hungry, I would have ordered more!  It was that good!  We did manage to squeeze in some dessert, which again, was delightful!  Do not remember the name, but it was banana creme-filled mini-rollups that you could dip in either a caramel or chocolate sauce!  Delicious!  The coffee here is very tasty as well.  Whenever I am back in Vegas, this will be a lunch or dinner stop for sure!"

Soft and juicy is all I have to say. Sorry to say, but everything I had was amazing.  Our rep took us out for dinner so it was NO HOLDS BAR and order whatever we desired. YUm YuM and YUM!\n\nASK ABOUT THE SECRET MENU! make sure to check in and see what deals you'll get\n\nFYI - parties  larger 12 you have to select a pre-fix menu for the wednesday \"kudasai\" happy hour. and requires a RSVP and secret code given to you."

Our bartender just gave us a classic cucumber saketini and charge us for a white lotus lycheetini. And gave us the lame excuse that because everyone has been asking for the white lotus she made the mistake to charge us that. Be Smart, check your receipt !!!!!"

Suffice it to say: Excellent - loved the whole experience and inventive dishes.\n\nThere was ad odd smell to the restaurant that really changed the taste of the food - like wet, reused rags to wipe down the tables kind of smell. \n\nWe had a show to get see and they were really helpful in getting some of the more complicated items through the kitchen and onto our table ASAP!!!!\n\nKind of expensive - but hey, Las Vegas has changed a lot in the 30 (or so) years I've been going.\n\nWould I go back? If I had to, otherwise there are so many outstanding options in Vegas. However, if you haven't tried it I'd say DO IT!!!"

            "review": "We had the 10 course omakase style dinner at social house. The food was on the salty side, but was definitely tasty. However, for a $125 omakase dinner, I was expecting a bit more sashimi and sushi. Instead, our meal was pretty heavy with a lot of meats. Half of the meal were cooked dishes, and we only get 3 small portion of sashimi (first three courses) and 4 sushi each (9th course). The sashimi were great, but the sushi was only okay I think. \n\ndinner for six plus 1-2 drinks each, our bill came up to be a bit over $1,000 before tips. There is no doubt that the food tasted great, but it was a little bit too pricy for the items that I got in my opinion."

            "review": "5 stars across the board . . . My 5-star reviews are few and far between these days, particularly because many of the restaurants I've visited in the past few months have missed the mark in some way or another.  Social House provided that rare experience that combines the best of ambiance, food and service. \n\nThe modern restaurant is visually stunning from the moment you first walk into the lounge area and then sashay up to the host table. We had made a last minute Open Table reservation on a Friday night, and we were seated as soon as we came in. I loved the set up of the restaurant. First, they put us in the back area, but it was a little too dark for my taste, so we asked if we could have one of the booths in the front section. They were so accommodating, and said we would love this new table as it gave us a view of everyone who parades by. And it sure did! I am 100 percent sure my husband was the oldest person in the restaurant, and even being 16 years his junior, I am about 80 percent sure that I was the next oldest. But it sure was fun people watching . . . bachelor and bachelorette parties galore with some of the most interestingly dressed and entertaining people gliding by us.\n\nOur server was fabulous! The menu offers so many wonderful options and he helped guide us through the choices, pointing out the fabulous and steering us away from the ordinary. We started with the Yellowtail Jalapeno. Don't be put off thinking it might be too spicy . . . it's not . . . a perfect melding of flavors with the tender Yellowtail and the crunchy jalapeno in a cilantro soy base. Next up . . . the salmon tartare, which was my favorite. The combination of the fresh and silky salmon layered with wasabi cream and drizzled with citrus soy was heavenly . . . so much so that I ordered another just for myself while hubby was licking his chops -- literally -- the tender Kurabuta Pork Ribs smothered in a sweet soy glaze were falling off the bone. We then shared the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups . . . while we loved the dish, we found this a little skimpy for the price with only two pieces. As I was getting quite full, I opted to order only the roasted miso eggplant which put the finishing touches on my great meal.. My hubby with his big appetite ordered the hangar steak with roasted shallots and more of that delectable wasabi cream sauce. From pig heaven to cow heaven!\n\nSocial House is totally a hip place, even for us not-so-hip middle-agers. We had a fantastic meal, conscientious service and \"free\" entertainment. No doubt we will make another trip to Social House on our next trip to LV.\n\nP.S. Unlike some other reviewers, we felt we got great bang for our buck!"

            "review": "My girls + a boy and I went  Social House for a Bachelorette Weekend.  All I can say is they really service you in every which way possible a dining establishment can. Decor check. Charming cute waiter check. Melt in your mouth kobe check. The only thing that possibly made me a little sad was when I saw the bill...my goodness, did those 18 pieces of thin orgasmic meats really cost me nearly 100 bucks?!? That's the most expensive orgasm I've ever had! \n\nWith all naughtiness aside: \n\nAmbiance: Dark brown hues, with manila lights. Made me feel like I was dining in a ritzy cave in a brightly lit crystal city center mall. It was romantic and everything you would stereotype a Vegas upscale joint.  But somehow, I wished that it was a little brighter so that I could actually see the food. When dining, the appeal plays great tricks to the the belly. In the case of social house, I couldn't see the freshness of the yellowtail carpaccio or its brilliant colors until I went home to check out the pics. Did the yellow tail appeal match its freshness? Absolutely! But if maybe they threw in a couple of candles so I could see my food would I have instant gratification instead of going home 3 days later to find out. \n\nService: The waiter was not just your typical waiter. He did whatever he could to serve us in anyway he could. Provided a very charismatic dialogue and never made us feel like we were a bunch of commoners eating in a what could have been a pretentious place. The manager also stopped by to apologize when they had slightly over cooked my dining companions raw steak and was really friendly. In other words, they try to strive per perfection. \n\nFood: \nI've teased you enough, so without much further ado, the food. We started with a toast to the bachelorette with a red champagne, made with a tint of hisbicus. It was sooo yummy and sweet like a kiss. Not for those of you who likes the taste of liquor because there wasn't even a hint of that taste. Deceptive, because the bride to be and I were a little happy afterwards...drank too fast because it was delicious. \n\nAppetizers, we had the yellowtail carpaccio with tempura jalepeno, 5oz of thinly sliced Kobe, and toro tartare. Entree of Kobe hanger steak. The yellow carpaccio was absolutely great. The fish melted and the spice from jalepeno was so subtle, I could barely taste it. It provided the perfect crunch. The tuna tartare, lacked a little flavor at the first taste but then the little rice balls injected flavor and flair to its texture. \n\nThe kobe beef, prepared too ways, was fantastic. The garlic-seared kobe was by far superior over the spicy ponzu. Both melted, but the garlic-seared had a unique flavor to it. The Kobe hanger with yuzu egg was very tasty but didn't melt like the appetizer. None the less, it was very tender.  Also had a yellow tail roll with chimchurri, good but was nothing extraordinary in comparison to the rest of the meal.  \n\nFor dessert, they had complimentary truffle lollipops..yum...\n\nConclusion: Social House, I am impressed. But why must you make my  wallet bleed so hard. Fortunately, I live way too far away for you to become one of my new addictions. Because if I were closer, it'd be an abusive relationship and your kobe beef would be doing the ass smacking."

            "review": "I'd have to say that Social House comes the closest to Nobu in terms of quality and deliciousness out of all the fancy-shmancy Japanese restaurants I've ever been to-this includes: Katsuya, Koi, and Ozumo.  Everything we had here was wonderfully delicious, and the view from the patio made the experience even better.\n\nWe ordered the ahi special, the seared scallops with eggplant, the citrus peel miso cod, edamame, a bottle of sake (forget which one) and some rolls for the table.  All of them were very tasty.  I'd say that scallop dish is up there with the best scallop dishes I've ever had-and I'm a big scallop fan.  The miso cod was the closest to Nobu's cod in terms of quality and taste out of all the miso cods i've tried-although it was a little too sweet.  I'd also like to mention that the edamame was cooked well-something that many upscale Japanese restaurants do not get right!  It came out warm, soft and SALTED.  In addition, our server Jared was down to earth and a pleasure to talk to.\n\nThe ambiance was nice as well-I'd say its better than Nobu's ambiance-they have a large patio that overlooks the strip.  Perfect for taking first timers visiting Vegas.  The crowd is hip and young, but the quality of the food shines through the fluff.  I will definitely be back."

They have a prefix three course lunch menu for $20 that my wife got. It was definitely a good value. She got a cucumber salad, a large bowl of beefy ramen and two rolls (California and spicy tuna). She enjoyed it.\n\nI really wanted some sashimi but that have very limited selections for lunch. The waiter talked me into getting a salmon sashimi dish topped with all the fru fru accompaniments that you would find at a place like Nobu. I just wanted the sashimi. It was $22. Not a bad deal for 5 pieces of salmon...in Vegas. I also ordered an Asahi beer which was $9. That was a very high price for Asahi but hey, I'm in Vegas.\n\nOverall this place was okay. Nothing special. At least for lunch anyways. It's a good value if you stick to the prefix lunch menu."

My overall rating is based on both of my experiences. Here's the breakdown:\n\nService: Fantastic. Our server was there when we needed him, but not there when we didn't. Our order was taken correctly and delivered promptly. \n\nFood: Decent. Really nothing special. Here's what we ordered:\nLunch Prix Fixe:\nSunomono salad- bland. I had to add a ton of soy sauce to it to make it edible. I wish I would have gotten the green salad. \nShrimp Tempura Donburi- just okay. Very small portion of shrimp. \nSalmon Avocado Cut Roll- awful. I have had better sushi off the strip. \n\n*During my previous visit I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen Noodles and they tasted great, but killed my stomach afterwards. This ramen is very oily and it mainly consists of pork belly. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered: \nLunch Prix Fixe\nMiso Soup- he remarked that it was average. It had almost a smoky taste, which he enjoyed, but it wasn't good enough to make him want to go back.\nChicken Teriyaki Donburi- he noted it was a hair over cooked and nothing special.\nSpicy Tuna Cut Roll- he said it was not spicy and not very flavorful. \n\nPrices: The Lunch Prix Fixe is the way to go. It's an okay amount of food for $20. I was still hungry after my meal. I also don't think the quality of the food lives up to the price. I would charge $15 for the portion size and quality of the prix fixe.\n\nAtmosphere: The restaurant itself is really lovely. I love the decor and the vibe. It's a very comfortable and chic setting. \n\nOverall, I am not interested in visiting this place for a third time. I gave it two good tries and am still unimpressed."

            "review": "So far so good! My amazing friend told me about this place and its happy hour from 5-8pm. Working inside a casino -- you start to run out of places to go for lunch and this is a nice gem over at Crystals. \n\nI only tried out 3 things off this HH menu and that's really all I need. They've got ramen -- choice of either tonkotsu or miso. And of course, my personal favorite is tonkatsu. \n\nThe broth is delish! It might possibly be my favorite broth here in Vegas :0). My friend said it was better than the last time she came here, too. \n\nThe noodles were a bit too soft for my liking but still good nonetheless. Maybe next time I can request firm noodles or something. \n\nWe also ordered angry tuna and salmon avocado rolls. Yums. Both are good but I especially love salmon + avocado so that's a winner. They're $8 per order for the rolls. $8 for the ramen as well. \n\nService for food was as expected but the ramen will take awhile to come out. We finished with our rolls and the ramen still wasn't ready. The hostess just gave I'm-stuck-up vibes though but everything else in terms of service was good. I will be back! :0)\n\nTLDR:\nHappy hour 5-8pm\n$8 tonkotsu or miso ramen\n$8 yummy salmon avocado roll\nPricing during HH only"

Someone had ordered for us last time so we had no idea what we had time we were there. The only thing we remembered was the miso cod and kobe beef. The last time I had the miso cod, it was like butter in my mouth. Seriously, I dreamed of that miso cod for months. We got it again this time and it definitely wasn't the same. I don't know if we came on a bad night or if they got a different chef but it was not that great. It was good but not as magical as I remembered. We also got the mixed sashimi which was good. The tempura lobster roll and social house ultimate roll were okay. Nothing amazing. The only thing I really enjoyed was the garlic oil seared kobe sashimi. Basically, it was not worth the money.

Would order another again in a heartbeat.\n\nSpicy Tuna Roll - 5 stars ($13)\nAwesome combinations of flavors!  One of THE best we've ever had.\n\nHamachi Yellowtail NIGIRI - 4 stars ($12)\nVery good.  Super tender, but with solid texture\n\nSake Salmon NIGIRI - 4 stars ($12)\nCreamy texture with good salmon flavor\n\nSalmon Mango Roll- 5  stars ($22)\nWOW!  Wonderful flavors and textures with a sweetness almost akin to dessert.\n\nWe might go back, but there are many so other sushi restaurants to try here in Vegas first."

I looked at the menu and I don't see ramen anywhere, I asked the waiter and he told me they only serve ramen during lunch and HH. Nonetheless, I ordered the angry tuna roll, soft shell crab roll and a miso soup for myself. The deep fried portion is very good, but overall, the rolls are okay compare to other sushi restaurants on the strip. Plus the price is steep for the quality. The decor is dark and roll along the bird nest theme of crystal mall. \n\nTo conclude, I've been to more than 3 Japanese restaurant on the strip with similar price point. there's better choice if you are eating sushi on the strip, it's over priced and not worth it for the taste of experience."

Our server started out by telling us that the sushi was overpriced and that they were not known for  sushi dishes, which was rather confusing since they advertize sushi on their sign.  Our server upsold like crazy, and convinced me into ordering a 45 dollar Kobe Beef \"Hot Stone,\" where you grill the beef yourself.  It sounded great, but when I saw the four  one-ounce slices of Kobe beef for my meal, I was appaled.  Other members of my party also ordered the same, and their reaction was the similar.  We sent our dishes back, and instead ordered Sushi dishes, which were relatively decent, both in price and quality, even though it took another half hour for them to be served.  Pretty much everything our server told us seemed to be wrong, and it appeared he was just trying to bring up the tab for a bigger tip.  Afterwards many of us ended up eating elsewhere as the portions were too tiny for a regular meal."

We were looking for a sushi place, and the sushi restaurant at the Cosmopolitan (where we were staying) wasn't open until 5:30PM, so I searched for another place and Social House came up right across the street, so we figured we would check it out.  I reserved a table for four on open table.com, which was incredibly easy to do from the yelp.com app on my phone.  Once we arrived, we were seated promptly.  We must have arrived at the perfect time, because the chefs were literally just starting to cut up the fish, so everything was SUPER fresh.  The staff was friendly and respectful.  The only set back was that the food took a little while to come out and our food all came out at different times, which may have been because they were still cutting up the fish, but I'm not sure.  Either way, I would definitely visit this place again.  The decor was dim and romantic, but not too \"date-night\" for a group of friends."

The waiter, who was friendly, attentive and gregarious, recommended the spicy peppers as an appetizer (and as an alternative to edamame) and they were delicious. The buttery sauce meshed well with the semi-spicy chilies and made for a light, not-so-filling starter.\n\nWe followed with the BBQ eel (grilled maybe, I forget) and the lobster tempura, both of which had a distinct and delectable taste. In general, I enjoy sushi that has some sort of sauce drizzled over it, and both of these had a spicy one, which I appreciated. \n\nDessert followed, and we went for the lava cake with Kenyan coffee to accompany it. Good combination and a great finish to an outstanding meal. \n\nI also had and would recommend the cachaca drink after dinner, it was somewhat like a White Russian but with the distinct taste that cachaca offers. \n\nOverall, this was an outstanding meal and a great way to splurge in Vegas and not be disappointed. Meal for two with tip cost $180, which was well worth it for the combination of ambiance, service, food and drink."

Definitely lack of communication amongst the staff.\n\nI was exhausted and about 8 Scotches deep and not in a particularly good mode when the food finally came.\n\nAs much as part of me wanted to dislike the food; I couldn't do it!  The sushi was surprisingly good, the sashimi was fresh and the rolls were well balanced and proportioned.\n\nEven the Kobe beef roll (I deducted one star because of this atrocity) was tasty in a weird way.  \n\nThe sake the server recommended was quite good; since I did not pick up the check I have no idea if it was a good value as well.\n\nSocial House is a fusion style Sushi place, which is cool if you like that.  I am sure it appeals to more people who are on vacation.  Being a Sushi purist I don't mind visiting places like this, but they always slightly disappoint.  \n\nIf you are unfortunate enough to be staying at the TI, and you have an expense account, check this place out.  Otherwise, I imagine there has to be more traditional affordably priced sushi somewhere in the area."

Everything was delicious!  Service is really friendly with out being cheesy.  Being Filipinos, of course the Crispy Pata could of used more pork skin on it but oh well, we are in Vegas and not everyone appreciates pork skin like we do.\n\nHonestly, I was stuffed by the end of our meal, no room for desert.

The ambiance was pretty hip, definitely a positive for the restaurant (very surprising considering Social House is located inside a mall!) For an appetizer, we ordered edamame and they had a unique way of serving it because half was salted, but the other half had a delicious chili (non-spicy) sauce. Very nice!\n\nFor our main courses, we ordered these sushi rolls:\n- Angry Tuna \n- Hamachimi roll \n- Tempua Lobster\n- Seared Alabacore\n- Spider roll\n\nThe Angry Tuna was definitely the best and the others were good (not great). For the price points ($20 per roll) I was expecting more. If you're REALLY looking for a cool ambiance and some delicious edamame, this is your place. However I think you can probably find better sushi for WAY less money elsewhere."

We walked around the Aria Hotel which is totally fabulous, we're going to stay there next time we visit, and wandered over into Social House for dinner. The decor is sexy and romantic and the hostess was very friendly.  Their cucumber salad was pretty good but their Kalbi steak was not good - it was missing all the flavor that makes it Kalbi, so it was just plain. Their \"dessert\" are sushi rolls and they're alright. We've definitely had better sushi in California. The waiter was OK - he seemed a little pompous and as we told him it was our first visit, he made some recommendations but seemed really pushy. When we told him we wanted to order our own food he didn't seem happy. Food was 3 star, waiter was 2.5. It wasn't that great, I'd say you go there more for the atmosphere than the service of food. We probably won't go back again."

Other than that, this place is amazingly designed and rather maze-like.  It's nice to get lost somewhere other than between slot machines and chain smokers.\n\nWe sat on the patio in the evening.  It was nice, end of summer night. Unfortunately the Sirens show was cancelled due to high winds (although I'd seen it before and it would definitely ruin the mojo of the restaurant).\n\nI LOVE family style.  Lets me try a whole bunch of new things and not having to eat huge quantities of anything.  Although I'm sure it wasn't so fun for one of my buddies who is a more tentative eater.\n\nThe cocktails were decent -- I got the green tea one.  Never had anything like it.  Had a second one.  It was good, but not mind-blowing.\n\nThe food, however, was right up my alley.\n\nScallops are a weakness of mine.  These were AMAZING.  We also got the jidori chicken breast (very tender), lobster curry salad (light and perfectly done), house salad (decent), sesame noodles, yellowtail sashimi, and some rolls.  If there was a weak point in the meal, it was probably the sushi.  The fish wasn't of mind-blowing quality, and the rolls we got weren't terribly imaginative (spicy tuna with twist, etc).  That said, it was still very good.\n\nThis is the kind of place that is perfect for a group.  I think you would definitely miss the dynamic if you come with just 2.  But that should be pretty obvious.  Check the name."

Dimmed lights, upbeat music and perky girls in high heels greeting you as you walk in. Typical in a swanky Vegas restaurant. \nThey have a Social Hour daily from 5-8. However, the menu is limited and the cocktails are weak. I ordered the pinot grigio which was on the sweeter side. Their rolls are decent, but you can't mess up a classic salmon avocado or tuna roll. Our waitress was sweet, until she interrupted our conversation after we were finishing up on our drinks. Basically she wanted us to GTFO.\nNot worth the money, unless you're looking for ambiance on the strip and don't mind paying the price. Otherwise, try hitting up off-strip sushi places like Raku."

To start - it was Happy Hour - yes Happy Hour on the strip in Las Vegas - WOW! That just happened.  \n\nSo I stroll in and order amazing Sakitini's and followed by cold sake - which was on happy hour for an amazing price.  \n\nLet me first tell you all about the Angry Tuna Roll.  First I hate Las Vegas, and I only go when I have a convention and I always come back sick!  So naturally I am a little angry while being there.  So when I saw Angry Tuna Roll - it became an instant HIT!  The flavor was amazing, tuna prepared perfectly and the avocado was still cold, even though this roll was fried.  The spice from the jalapeno and sweet sauce on top was amazing.  A great mixture of sweet and spice. \n\nThen I ordered some Miso Ramen, which seems simple enough.  They flavored it perfectly, added vegetables and a poached egg, which made the flavor more intense with the yoke.  They really made the poached egg perfectly, which is no easy task. \n\nIn addition to great food, the service was outstanding.  As it turns out a new guy waited on us the first time and he had the most amazing energy and the next day I came back to dine again and to compliment the guy from the previous day.  I found out he was new, and he just had passion and drive.  Something so many restaurants lack on the Strip of Vegas."

Many have recommended the Social House for my family and I, but they also mentioned it was a little expensive comparing to other restaurants, but I thought it should be worth it, and did disagree with them, the prices are fair. They offer rich service, it is not a fast food place, of course it should cost a little more than other places. We were seated by the hostess, very nice first impression, then the waiter came to take our orders, of course he offered us something to drink first and that's when we ordered tea, the tea itself wasn't marvelous, I drink similar or better tea at home, but the way they served it was a signature, very traditional, as if you we served by an Asian family at their house, - which I have been before-. We ordered couple of dishes and few salads to try them, never got the chance to try any soup, but everything was delicious and in the right proportion because I have also been told that they served small not enough proportions. The dessert was my favorite, vanilla ice cream- truffle cake, it was the best dessert I have ever had, and I am absolutely experienced when it comes to good taste of chocolate and ice cream. Overall, a 5 stars restaurants, I would visit everything I have the chance to, recommended for dates."

Although I had made a reservation and specified the balcony, we still had to wait a good 15 minutes before a table was made available for us... so boo to that. One of my friends actually had a very stern chat with the GM since they were acting as if they weren't going to give it to us. Because we were a group of hot girls mostly (my bf at the time was with us) we were seated right next to the window on the balcony to watch the Pirate show. I loved that they did that for us since watching the show was awesome! The boat went right by us and we got to watch the show as we ate. Hot seamen 12 o'clock! For my first time in Vegas being of legal age to drink, this was definitely one of those experiences that left a lasting impression and fun memory.\n\nSocial House itself is very overpriced, if you could not determine that form the menu yourself. Six dollars for a tiny cup of miso soup?! No. Just, no. \n\nI think I was alcohol poisoned by this point in time on my trip because I really couldn't eat anything. My stomach was hurting all throughout with a sharp intense stinging pain and I could barely move the entire weekend. I guess that's what I get for drinking excessive amounts of alcohol for 5 nights straight before heading to Vegas... whoops. Because of this, I only ordered a miso soup and 2 orders of sushi... one being salmon. It was good but not great. Certainly not worth the amount they charged.  If I wasn't paying for it I might have enjoyed it more haha. My friends all enjoyed their meals. I remember that people loved the black miso cod entree so I hope they still have this as an option at their new location at City Center.\n\nSo yes, it was my birthday. I looked good (as you can see in my photo) and besides the small stint in the bathroom where my friend and I refunded our soup in the middle of dinner, I had a great time there. Ok so maybe that was TMI... but deal with it. You've read worse.\n\nI will miss this location.... if only for the TI pirate show and the beautiful gold box wall in the entrance- it was great to take pictures in front of! I look forward to one day trying out Social House at its new home but it will have to be for a special occasion. I don't like dropping money in Vegas for no reason."

Thankfully, a dinner at Social House also became a tradition after our first visit. This last year was our third time, and Social House definitely did not disappoint. \n\nWhile I loved the ambiance at their old location more, their new spot in City Center maintained the delectable flavors we came for. If you've never been, the chef recommends ordering several small dishes and sharing them family style. They're also super flexible about customizing the serving sizes to your group (i.e. we had six on our side, so they let us order one and a half dishes for some things). \n\nHere are some of our picks:\n\n- Hamachi with jalape\u00f1os. Sure it's simple and it's been done elsewhere, but that doesn't make this dish any less delicious. The quality of fish here is superb, and they accompany it with tempura'd jalape\u00f1o slices. Amazing, I just wish it came with more pieces.\n\n- Hamachi tartare. Tried this for the first time this year. Not amazing but it was still tasty.\n\n- Cod bibb lettuce cups. Oh my lord, these were great! The host mentioned that these were a specialty of the chef: slow cooked miso cod wrapped in a bed of lettuce? Do not miss, for sure.\n\n- Kobe sliders. We didn't get them this round (\"They're essentially $5 a bite.\") but these are incredible. \n\n- Tocino ribs. Fall off the bone is an understatement! These were incredibly tender and had a great flavor.\n\n- Angry tuna roll. I'm generally wary when people deep fry rolls, but this was still delicate, flavorful, and definitely had a good kick to it!\n\n- Sake bombs. What the heck? Their new method is an overturned shot glass in a cup of beer. Def not as fun as balancing the sake glass over chopsticks and slamming the table with a resounding KANPAI! Bring those back!\n\nTil next time, Social House!"

I didn't taste the alcohol and they used real ginger (although annoying to find pieces of ginger float into your mouth while drinking, it added that special punch to the drink).  I had two of those and was feeling pretty buzzed quickly. \n\nWe sat outside on the terrace, and from where we sat you can watch the Sirens of Treasure Island show.  All I can say is after enduring one of those shows, you dont want to stick around for the one in the next hour to witness that again.\n\nOnto the food.  I ordered the Tocino BBQ babyback ribs.  When it arrived, I hate to admit, but I was disappointed there was no rice, so I ordered that on the side.  Totally filipino I know.  I was skeptical looking at my ribs because I had a feeling the meat would be stuck to the bone and I'd have to use my hands to eat it.  So i picked at it a little with my fork gauging if it was going to be tough to get it off the bone.  I was definitely wrong.  The meat peeled away with such ease, and when eating it, oh man, it just melts in your mouth!  It was soo good!  There were chunks of something around the ribs, and I wasn't sure what it was.  It looked like mango, but it wasn't.  Turned out they were pickled beets.  Not really my thing, but my friends definitely enjoyed it.  \n\nI also had some of my friends Cod, and that also melted in my mouth, so so good.  OH and the seaweed salad.  That's really stuff that's generally good, but for some reason at Social House it tasted like the best seaweed salad I had ever encountered!  Very good!\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas I think I'll convince my family to dine here once. :)  It's definitely worth a trip back."

It has a bar on the casino floor corner where you wait to be escorted up a very sleek stairwell to the second floor where there is the dinning.  The layout of the restaurant is very unique and echoes that of many high end restaurants in LA... the beautiful thing is that the cost is less then those of similar architecture.  \n\nIf you loathe the pirate show you should not dine here, if you like it and its nostalgic Las vegas feeling as i do it really adds to compliment your evening on this second story dinning experience at the Treasure Island. \n\nThis is a Japanese based restaurant, the food is good to great and the environment is alive and hip... a very unique energy... a lot of buzz with out the pounding annoyance.\n\nGreat location, enjoyable atmosphere, and good food put this joint at 4-5 star rating.  Left rating at 4 star for the all too familiar \"wonderful\" attitudes of the Las Vegas employees..."

Great, attentive service from all the male servers if you're a group of women.  The only thing I regret is not asking for the name of this berry flavored sake I ordered.  I loved it!  It's in a blue bottle with a red label with gold lettering.  Does anyone know what it was called or have any info on it?  I've searched high and low online for it only to come up short so if it's something that is made exclusively for Social House, closed or not, then I guess I can cease my search.  In any case if anyone knows of this sake then any info would be greatly appreciated."

Happy hour is from 5-7pm everyday.  \n\nWe had some time to spare before going out to see a show so we stopped here.  Staff was welcoming and really friendly but I would not describe them as attentive.  No wine on the happy hour menu.  Thumbs down.  We ordered two food items off the HH menu (can't remember exactly what its called and I can't find the HH menu anywhere online).  One of them was the fish sliders.  TINY.  But they were good.  The other thing we ordered was this shredded meat over fries with cheese and other stuff.  This was disgusting.  Super greasy and salty.  I wish I had sent it back and got a refund. \n\nOne star for a friendly staff and a clean, hip setting of the bar area.  Another star for having the NBA playoffs on the TV."

Crystals smells like the Aria casino/hotel to me, like a non-over powering vanilla spray. Social House is across from Stella McCartney.\n\nWe had several rolls, including one of my favs salmon/avocado. The salmon carpaccio (off the happy hour menu) is also delish. The delicate sauce and a little scoop of cavier on top make this dish.\n\nHowever, the winner for me was the ramen! I was surprised to see it on the HH menu. I asked our waiter about it and he said it was one of his favorite dishes, so for $8 (thank you HH!) I decided to try, with a poached egg in it. WOW so delicious! The broth was flavorful, not overly salty. The noodles were a nice texture and the poached egg (be sure to break it up with your spoon) made a very nice addition to the soup. Everyone noticed how quiet I got when I received my ramen...whoops hehe. That's how delicious it is. Definitely try it.\n\nEveryone in our party (of the first timers) commented that they would be back."

Our waitress came over pretty quickly after we sat down but then it just went downhill from there. We had ordered drinks and the waitress brought my friend the wrong beer. We then ordered edamame and a bunch of sushi cut rolls, We were really hungry b/c we had just traveled to Vegas and went straight to dinner from the airport. We ordered the spicy tuna, salmon avocado, shrimp tempura and spicy scallop rolls. It then took about 45 mins. to get our rolls and we were starving! We ate those rolls pretty fast once they got to the table. We were still hungry, so for some reason we thought it would be a good idea to get some more rolls. Bad idea. The next set of sushi rolls took another hour. We almost wanted to cancel the order b/c it was taking so long. We were hungry but also tired and just wanted to get out of there. \n\nAfter we finally got the second set of sushi rolls, we immediately asked for our bill b/c we knew that would take a while, which we were right about. \n\nAfter about another 20 minutes, we were able to pay our bill and leave. \n\nAs far as the sushi goes, it was really good. Our favorite was the shrimp tempura. Our least favorites were the spicy scallop and tuna b/c they were not spicy. \n\nThe whole meal lasted almost 2.5 hours, which is pretty ridiculous. Not sure if I would go back b/c I don't think I have the patience."

Well,  this time you are on the second floor and if you are sitting on the outside beside the window, you will see part of the show.  Our server informs us that the food is served family style.  We ended up order the eel sushi roll, Seaweed salad, and chicken something (not sure of the name).  The eel sushi roll was pretty bad as the eel meat was mushy - yuck.  Even the eel they served on a recent  flight on Japan AIrlines (economy) was 10 times better. The seaweed salad I enjoyed, actually I ate most of this cause it was soooo good.  The chicken really good for her but for me,  it was like any other chicken dish served at Spaghetti factory.  Service was good during our time there.  The names given for the sake were pretentious as I ordered Voices of the Mist. Mist - I hope they didn't add water to my sake cause it was not strong enough for me.  Overall not bad, but if you want to see the SIren show but do not want to wait in the crowd, then this place is your best bet."

We didn't have a reservation and were about to settle for just sitting anywhere when the hostess recommended the patio because the pirate show was going to start in 10 minutes. We thanked her for the tip and were seated outside- and got a front row seat for the show! \n\neverything we ordered was amazing- we were even with a sushi hater who said his terryaki chicken was delish. \n\nwhen we got the bill we were a little taken aback- it was pretty expensive our bill for 3 people + 2 bottles of Saki was about $80- $90 bucks but we all agreed it was worth it. \n\nthe second time we went it was a girlfriends 21st birthday and we had just won $1000 on penny slots so wanted a great dinner to celebrate- knowing the insider tip about the balcony we called ahead and made reservations for 15 min. before showtime. The waiter was so sweet and took multiple pictures for us and gave us passes to these clubs going on and even a free birthday shot for the bday girl. \n\nonce again the food was GREAT. we all ordered something diff and all picked off each others plates. \n\nagain it was expensive but it IS VEGAS so...... \n\n\noh and we are all newly obsessed with sparkling sake thanks to this place- so if you love your rice wine you should try it sparkling\nFantastic!"

Love the music, but as is the rage these days, it was just a bit too loud. Perhaps that was to prevent us from hearing all the obviously interesting conversations around us. I'lll get back to that.\n\nWe arrived early for our 8:30 reservation on a Sun eve but were seated promptly.  Two servers dropped by to introduce themselves and noted they would BOTH be taking care of us; a concept that seemed to work very well throughout the eve as we are checked in on frequently all night.  We asked for suggestions for sake cocktails; we were surprised they offered so few as they are all the rage back in Omaha. But she suggested a sake-a-tini which turned out to be delicious.\n\nThe food is definitely the star here. Others here have raved about the tuna sashimi with the jalpenos.. Yum yum. The kobe beef (you get your choice of domestic or imported!!!!) with creme fraiche was also to die for.  We came for sushi and focused on the rolls... and loved everything! The box roll is excellent.... and the lobster roll with a curry sauce on the side was also a great recommendation from the server. \n\nIf people watching is your thing, Social House sure does have it. We were seated among some very interesting tables.  The older couple on our right was obviously each out for the eve away from the real spouses... she had a very high pitched Betty Boop voice and a rock on her finger the size of Rhode Island. On the other side of us, Borat and his brother were dining with their rent-a-dates and being all creepy and shit... talking to their dates with their puffedout chests, feeding the ladies as they pretended to be alternately repulsed and delighted while spending their drachmas. \n\nAll in all a great Vegas evening.

That being said, we went on Social House's website to view the online menu. My boyfriend LOVES sushi and I do not. I saw something that I could get on their menu (chicken dumplings), so I gave in and we went to Social House. We made reservations at 9:00, but showed up at 9:10 and were told that our table wasn't ready yet. We waited at the bar for about 5 minutes or so, walked into the dining area and there is no one in there. There are tons of empty booths. Why did we have to wait? We were not given menus when we were seated and basically stared at each other for another 5 minutes or so before we got our menus. I look at the menu and just my luck, no chicken dumplings are listed. There is absolutely nothing else I liked on the menu. I'm a picky Italian and I love my pasta and that's about it. My boyfriend was also going to get lambchops along with some sushi. The lambchops also were not listed on the menu either, but were listed on the online menu. The waiter said that they did not have the chicken dumplings, but they had something similar to it. They did have the lambchops. So I ordered the \"similiar\" item and my boyfriend ordered sushi along with lambchops. My \"simiar\" item comes out and it was a big bowl filled with curry and chicken meatballs. It looked disgusting. But I was starving so I tried one. It was worst than it looked. I couldn't even go on to take another bite. My boyfriend's lambchops were also drenched in curry...he did not like this either. Why is curry even in this restaurant? The reason for the two star rating is that their online menu is not the same as their menu at the restaurant. If I had known they didn't have any food I liked, we would have gone to Khoi or Sushi Roku (where we've been before and love). We wanted to go somewhere different this time. They need to update their online menu or put a disclaimer. The waiter didn't charge me for the \"chicken meatballs\" after I complained, so they get a star for that. All in all it was a horrible experience, we will not be going back. We left with our stomachs rumbling and had to end up going to another restaurant instead."

We decided to share plates since we wanted EVERRRRRYTHIIING! The grilled salmon was very tasty. The teriyaki sauce with it was thick, somewhat sweet, and the salmon was beautifully cooked. The miso port short ribs were fantastic. The meat fell off the bone and the Israeli couscous was a nice accompanying grain. The angry tuna roll was everything I hoped it would be. However, I've had similar in \"everyday\" Japanese restaurants before so I wasn't completely won over by this. Nonetheless, it was still tasty. The kobe tacos were fantastic and is great for sharing. The tuna tataki salad was also great. Now, as a Filipino, I HAD to order the crispy pata. I understand I can't expect it to be like the ones I had growing up... Social House's interpretation was solid... but still left me a little disappointed. Perhaps because I know crispy pata shouldn't be $26 (HA!), but also because I think the SoHo pickles didn't suffice as an accompanying side. I wish it had come with some sort of greens instead or paired with an interesting starch that isn't necessarily rice. (Typically, us Filipinos would just douse that pata with vinegar/soy sauce-vinegar and bring on the rice, but I know it's supposed to be an \"elevated\" version of the classic meat so.....) \n\nAnyway, Social House is the place to go if you want a wide array of pan-Asian food, has a \"fun\" crowd of scenesters, and is close to all the action (it's inside Crystals). While I am giving this place 4 stars, however, I think there are other places more worthy of your Vegas culinary travels than Social House. Depends on what you and your mouth are looking for while in the (702)!"

Had a 10 courses prefix menus. Excellent variety. Great food. Price is comparable to other restaurants. We were full. Our main server was very good at keeping our courses serve in a timely  manner,  because we had a show to catch. Very nice and quiet. Not crazily busy. Had a back and front areas. Love it because we don't have to have to talk loud to hear each others. Would come back again. This is not a cheap place. Go to an all you can eat place if you want cheap. I think the price is fair for the quality of food that they serve, and the location that it is in."

            "review": "After reading numerous yelp reviews we decided to try Social House for one of our dinners on a recent trip to Vegas.  I was extremely impressed overall.\n\nAmbiance:\n\nThis place absolutely nailed it when it comes to decor.  From the 15-20 ft wooden door in the entrance way to the dim lounge lighting throughout, it was the perfect retreat from the flashy lights of Vegas.  \n\nService:\n\nOur waiter was extremely helpful.  We first asked for some recommendations for hot/cold sakes to choose from.  He asked what we liked and suggested particular sakes based on our feedback and desired price point.  Both our hot and cold selections were great and paired very well with the food.\n\nFood:\n\nAt the end of the day, what really distinguishes a restaurant is the food they serve.  Some dishese were better than others, but overall, most dishes were had were incredible.  With a group of three we were able to order a pretty good cross section of the menu.  \n\nYellowtail Jalapeno:  This was the BEST creative sashimi I've ever had.  Don't mistake this for traditional sashimi, because it is.  It's a modern take and extremely well done.  The yellowtail melted like butter, the jalapeno chip added the perfect hint of spice while providing a texture contrast, the cilantro provided the ideal freshness and the Calamansi soy provided the citrus to round everything out.  This was extremely balanced explosion of flavors without losing the fish.  Yelp needs a 6th star for this.\n\nTuna Special:  This was also great, but after trying the yellowtail jalapeno first, it became an after thought.  Same great balance of flavors and textures.  4 stars\n\nRock Shrimp Tempura:  The rock shrimp had the lightest tempura batter on the outside while staying tender and succulent.  However, the breading could've used some flavor (a little bit of salt goes a long way).  Of the trio of dipping sauces, the spicy ponzu was by far my favorite.  3 stars\n\nCod Bibb Lettuce Cups:\n\nOur waiter was extremely accomadating as a normal order is 2 pieces.  He suggested adding a 3rd piece without us even bringing it up.  I had high expectations, maybe a little too high after reading various reviews.  The cod itself was cooked to perfection.  However, the whole thing just lacked flavor.  Maybe the addition of a sauce would've elevated this dish.  3 stars.\n\nKobe Sliders:\n\nThe Kobe sliders came on Hawaiian bread.  The burger was flavorful and the shoe string fries were good but lacked creativity.  All the flavors were what you'd expect in a Kobe burger.  3 stars.\n\nKalbi Beef Roll:\n\nGood god this was good.  I love a good kalbi, but so many places over cook the short rib and it becomes stringy.  This is how kalbi should be done!  The texture of the beef was unctuous (in the best possible way) while the flavor was deep and full.  Of all the sushi I've had in my time, this was hands down the best non-traditional sushi roll I've had.  I could've eaten 3 rolls of these and been perfectly content.  Just like the yellowtail, this goes beyond 5 star territory.\n\nSeared Albacore:\n\nThis was also amazing, but like the tuna special sashimi, it was overshadowed by the Kalbi roll.  The flavors and textures all complimented each bite.  4 stars.  \n\nOverall, I'm really glad we were able to stop in.  Prices are expensive but reasonable for Vegas.  Social House provides far more value than some other restaurants on the strip.  This has become a staple in my Vegas restaurant rotation!"

Aside from the fact that the hostess sat a walk-in before us (although we had reservations) and made us wait although the restaurant was not even full, I was very happy with Social House. Our server was very friendly and accommodating-I would describe him as sweet-and the food was AMAZING. I was told portions were more tapas style, but the portions are wwaaayyy bigger than tapas style. Here's what I had:\n\nCitrus Peel Miso Cod: A good 8 ounce portion with awesome flavor and almost marshmallow like in texture. I wish I wasn't so full byt he time this came because I REALLY wanted to finish it.\n\nKobe Tataki Sushi roll: MMmmm...this one made me drool. A Shitake Mushroom roll topped with Med rare slices of Kobe beef. The beef was super tender and the sauce brought out so many flavors.\n\nCold Noodles with a creamy sesame sauce and tempura shrimp. This was hubby's favorite thing ever! Somehow I'm supposed to find out how this is made...\n\nHubby also had an assortment of nigiri and the Lobster Curry roll which looked good, but I didn't taste. He said it was fabu!\n\nCarrot Cardamon Cake. holy shit. can I eat this for every meal the entire time in Vegas? Because I would like to.\n\nThis place is awesome. It definitely redeemed my thoughts of Vegas casino restaurants tackling Asian Fusion but making it good."

New plan - Pre Fixe lunch menu at Social House.\n\nThis is a contemporary, strangely adorned restaurant located in Crystals. The restaurant itself was basically empty when my friend and I entered and were greeted by the hostess. We were sat in the dining room which espouses some kind of odd bordello/bird nest vibe. I say bird nest, because the enormous lighting fixtures above the dining room resembled bird nests made of hair. Take that as you will.\n\nOur waiter (Daniel) arrived and took our drink order. Ice water was ordered and we were delivered room temperature water. Daniel scurried around the restaurant taking care of other tables and disappearing while my friend and I decided upon our Pre Fixe meals. Many minutes later Daniel returned to take our order. \n\nDaniel insisted the Locomoco was \"just hamburger on rice with gravy\". No really, \"it's just hamburger\"; that is after we asked what the entree was and how it tasted. Nice sell, Daniel. Oh and he did beseechingly tell us, \"It's a Hawaiian dish\". Mm hmm. \n\nOrdered -\n\nGreen Tea ($7). Obviously this green tea must have been produced from rainbows from a panda's ass, because never in my life will I ever pay for Green Tea that is $7 ever again. Note to self - ask for drink prices. *face palm*\n\nMiso Soup - decent, perhaps a bit too salty. Very few cubes of tofu and even less green onions.\n\nChicken Teriykai Donburi - Chicken was dry as a bone. As sad as it is to say I felt as though *I* cooked the chicken in this dish because I ALWAYS overcook chicken. The pickled veggies in the dish were lost on me because I don't eat pickled anything.\n\nSalmon Roll - Decent. My favorite part of the whole meal. Wish I'd just gotten sushi for the whole meal. Although the rolls were on the minuscule side (no wonder, this place is in Crystals on the Strip). \n\nFood - Mediocre at best, perhaps dinner is better?\nDecor - Bordello Bird Nest\nService - Hope Daniel enjoyed his tip as much as he enjoyed being our server, as in, not much."

Pretty much started the research once we got into town. Found Social house and made a reservation. Picked a nice time slot, 6pm. We had to be someplace by 7:30 so it worked out. \nWe walked up to the place and there were only a few people in the bar area, at first glance the place looked tiny. The Bar wasn't all that big but looked freaking AWESOME! told the hostess my name and she said we'll be seating in 15min, you're more than welcome to sit at the bar and wait. OK! i forget the times on the happy hour but you cant be a beer for $3 in Vegas! \nAfter waiting our 15min. we were called up to be sat. Walked through some sexy red curtains and BANG right back to the ample seating and awesome decor. We were greeted by our server and told about how the Social House works. I was expecting super small portions but for Vegas and the venue not bad at all! \nWe picked up 3 different rolls, the Sun Dried Tomato Roll, Hamachi Roll and the Shrimp Battera. ALL 3 were ultra delicious and almost the best sushi i have ever had!! This was the first place i have picked different rolls and liked them ALL! We also ordered up some butter potato's which were also pretty dang good. This place is a hit and a must go if you like some sushi and a nice place to chill!"

I cannot say that I tried any other dishes here, as unfortunately on the day I visited they weren't offering the lunch special that's available during the week which includes 2 other courses in addition to the ramen, however, this one bowl was enough for me to lock Social House in as a regular stop when visiting Vegas.\n\nMy service was also exemplary here, which isn't an easy task considering I sat at the bar and only had one item to eat, but Jonah managed to do his best to keep me from dozing off and winding up with noodles on my face at 1 in the afternoon. Yeah, long night watching the sun come up, although thankfully I wasn't stuck out at the Vegas Motor Speedway like my friends who attended that night's EDC event, which was shut down due to wind, trapping everyone in an ecstasy induced frenzy for a few hours. From what I heard though the Steve Aoki protest set was pretty memorable and well worth the headaches. Jonah seemed to know all the blondes who looked like they had just left a \"Peepshow\" audition by name and typical menu orders as they strolled in, so clearly the guy is doing something right.\n\nBut, back to the ramen. It's about $17 for a bowl with pork belly and tonkatsu broth, and I think slightly cheaper if you want the seafood or miso versions...pricey, but what here isn't? I definitely recommend the pork belly though, even if you're vegetarian, because it's Vegas and whatnot, so if you can cheat on your husband you can cheat on your diet (and it might help take your mind off all the meat you had in your face at Thunder Down Under, which you just know your \"best friend\" Orphelium has photos of and will be eagerly awaiting the next time you forget to return her organic sewing kit to accidentally break them out in front of Thadly). The pork in this bowl is quite plentiful (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g?select=nHoa4e7h9Fe8ocEHkMI44w#-PhxZpR8PqXM_IFuzOupXg), and after a minute or two of soaking in the steaming broth it's extremely delicate and easy to dice up with your chop sticks. The broth itself has a good bit of depth as well, but I highly recommend dumping the entire side portion of pepper and spices and crispy garlic in for added flavor. By the time I got to the bottom of the bowl there was a really nice subtle burn going on in my mouth, exactly the thing I needed to get the day started in the right direction.\n\nThe setting here is pretty sexy (it's located inside the super luxurious Crystals mall), in a bold and brooding teahouse sort of way, and while those ideas may seem rather juxtaposed, I promise it works. I would love to return to Social House for a full course dinner meal, if this ramen is any indication, but for the time being I'm content in knowing I found what is likely one of the only places, and quite possibly the best, to offer up one of my favorite post-drinking-night cravings."

Waitors are attentive and we get our drinks and food in a timely fashion. The best seating is outside on the patio.  You can see the Pirates show too.  I've sat inside and that's not too bad, but it's always nice to be outdoors.  Foodwise, I've tried: (they have since changed their menu, but this is what it was called...)\n\nYellowtail Jalapeno (best thing EVER!  even my non-sushi eating boyfriend loves it)\nTuna Ginger (it's something that is not on the menu, but if you like the Yellowtail Jalapeno, this is similar to it)\nShrimp Skewer\nChicken Curry Skewer\nSpicy Tuna Roll\nArtic Charr, Truffle Soy Mirin Reduction (super crispy skin, really good)\n\nFor dessert, the lychee beignets and drunken blueberry.  Both really good.  Yes the portions are not super huge, but it filled my boyfriend and I enough that we were content and satisfied and not overflowing with food.  \n\nMy boyfriend also got a blueberry sake which was good as well.  Sweet and totally delightful to drink.  Now that they have changed their menu, I don't know if everything is the same, but the sushi definitely melted in your mouth and had that coldness that sashimi should definitely have."

It might get a little crowded if you go with a decent sized party (10ish).\n\nThe things that stood out on the menu were some Filipino dishes that you're not used to seeing at any restaurant that serves sushi.  According to the waiter, the head chef is a Filipino guy.  The waiter did a very good job selling the stuff to us, but as a Filipino, I certainly knew better than to pay $18 for six pieces of lumpia, or $20 for some pancit.  I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army.  Most of what we ordered was less than memorable and what really stood out were the steaks.  The filet came out rare and the ribeye came medium rare.  Both were amazing!  I'd go back and order just those.\n\nA couple hundred dollars spent for 6 of us was ok.  A little overpriced for what they sold but hey, that's Vegas."

I lived in Japan for 12 years so I feel comfortable saying that if you want some tasty, very reasonably priced Japanese food Social House is a good choice.  We had wasabi Bloody Mary mix, Miso soup, house salad, chicken teriyaki donburi, loco moco donburi, spicy tuna cut roll, and the avocado salmon cut roll. The chicken breast was plentiful, tender, and tasty. And they did not scrimp on the tuna or salmon either.

            "review": "This review is for their social hour (AKA happy hour) as that is what brought me here in the first place. \n\nSo social hour is daily (including weekends) from 5-8PM but ONLY in the bar area which consists of about 6 tables and the bar itself (10 seats?). It is on a first come first serve basis but if it's full when you arrive, you can have the hostess add you to be next to sit in the bar area. The restaurant is a little hard to find as it's in the Crystals mall on the 2nd floor next to Mastro's huge treehouse looking venue. \n\nSo onto the food:\n\nWatermelon Sake - Strong but with a good watermelon taste. Needless to say though, I did not drink much of that. \n\nTonkotsu ramen with added pork belly - At $11, this is a steal in Las Vegas. The broth was not bland and the pork belly was a huge slice, not just a scrawny piece. Inside was green onions, bamboo, and bean sprouts. Enough to make me full and suck up my alcohol intake for later on in the night. My friend ordered the miso ramen with pork belly and enjoyed his bowl as well. \n\nKobe beef roll - Something new. The beef was crispy which I enjoyed. Don't expect a gigantic roll though.\n\nAngry Tuna Roll - Tempura fried seaweed with fillings of tuna inside the roll. The portion on this roll was more so than the Kobe beef roll but also a more heavy roll in terms of per bite. I prefer the more light taste.\n\nCod Butter lettuce cup - I really liked this and could have ordered 2 more for myself. The It's lettuce cup with chunks of grilled cod (seasoned well) and crispy noodles on top. Definitely suggest trying this. \n\nOverall meal came out to be about $70. Both of us were full. Will be back to try other social hour menu items soon!"

First planned stop was American Fish for happy hour but... closed!  Second planned stop was Sage and... closed!  Bar Masa also closed! Dammit!\n\nWe started to lose faith and I nonchalantly suggested Social House in Crystals because we had never been there.  If the menu didn't appeal, at least we could have a Sapporo at the bar and re-think our strategy.  \n\nI was expecting something akin to Kona Grill... typical sushi but nothing to write home about.  I was so wrong.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  The friendly bartender gave us menus and we discovered that they actually have pretty decent cocktails!\n\nI had the Socialite ($14) which is spiced rum, passion fruit juice, orange juice, and serrano chili.  I didn't really taste the chili, but it was all good because it was yummy!\n\nMy husband had the Cachaca Espuma ($16) which is cachaca (fermented sugar cane), lime, green tea, and a vanilla/coconut foam (referred to as espuma).  The bartender grated a little lime peel on top.  I'm not a big fan of coconut and the smell was pretty strong but my husband made a dent in the foam so I could try the drink below without gagging and it was pretty good!\n\nFor food, we tried the yellowtail with crispy jalapeno, garlic dust, tiny cilantro (just like the microchives that used to be on everything a few years back), and calamansi soy ($22).  I think calamansi is a type of citrus fruit but I didn't ask.  This is excellent!  The crispy jalapeno adds good texture and is different than just having fresh or pickled jalapeno tossed on top.  And the garlic dust!  Everything should be covered in garlic dust!  Awesome idea!\n\nWe also tried the crispy pata which is a crackling pork shank with pickled carrots and garlic served with a chili vinegar on the side ($24).  The vinegar is very strong, and they warned us of that, so you only dip the pork in a little bit.  The pork shank has both crispy skin and tender meat.  Also the bones have some tasty bone marrow inside so get a chopstick and fish it out!  Yummy dish!\n\nThese are smallish portions but high quality food... perfect for a foodie crawl.  The bartender and servers are willing to spend time talking to you about your likes and dislikes and develop a tasting menu on the fly for you, which is pretty cool!  Definitely coming back here for a full meal to try that!"

To add to the intimidation factor, there were bouncer-types standing in front of the doors to the patio, where I suspect famous or very wealthy people were enjoying their meals.  \n\nIt was dark inside and they played club music, so it had that lounge effect.  The waiters were extremely attentive and at one point we had 3 or 4 coming  back and forth to ask us if we needed anything.\n\nI ordered the Kani crab sashimi and miso soup.  Both were perfect.  I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi and a classy, sleek atmosphere."

Loved both of these.  The kalbi was slightly crispy from a quick frying. The vegetarian was filled with a nice bit of cream cheese. Next we tried the Himachi specialty roll and the spicy scallop roll. Again, these were spot on. The spicy scallop came with a yummy sauce that could've been eaten alone!\n\nThe rolls had 6 pieces each. Just enough to fill our tummies and continue on with our night, without feeling too bloated.

No dish is overly delicate and it works perfectly in a social setting with good drinks and great friends.  It is a running theme at social house that you should be social.  Share your food.  Portions are large and with the exception of mains are plated to be shared.\n\nThe cold starters are all very fresh.  Top props to the yellow tail. Each piece topped with a jalapeno slice, micro cilantro, a hint of garlic (garlic dust), and a tart but salty calamansi soy.  The subtle flavor of the fish is quickly lost but its texture is the perfect foil to the bold flavors.  The toro tartar is also worth a try.  Love the texture from the arare (Japanese rice crackers).\n\nThe rock shrimp tempura starts the list of great hot dishes. Sweet shrimp surrounded by a fluffy yet crisp outside and served with a spicy ponzu dipping sauce.  Perfect with any drink.  The citrus peel miso cod in a lettuce cup is phenomenal.  Deeply infused miso flavor and a juicy peace of fish.  Add the sauteed foie to it and the richness will blow your mind.\n\nSushi? The crispy eel, shrimp tempura, avocado, with a spicy aioli and teriyaki unagi sauce make for GREAT eats.\n\nSeveral visits and the food never disappoints.\n\nService is very good and never intrusive.\n\nAlthough there is a good and fairly priced wine list,  its more fun sampling their cocktails and matching it with the food.\n\nNote: Sure you can dine here alone but that wouldn't that be antisocial?\n\nRecommended."

            "review": "I've been here 5 times now over the last 2 years, and even my ex-boss who's a total Nobu snob genuinely enjoyed himself when he joined us for dinner. The atmosphere is posh, lighting and decor is very interesting, clientele are varied and the volume can get loud especially as the night progresses. For me, this is just part of the ambiance and--maybe it's just me--but isn't this restaurant called  \"SOCIAL\" house? If you don't appreciate an atmosphere of socializing, perhaps you're better off elsewhere. ;)\n\nWhen I'm in Vegas for work and want to entertain clients, this is where I take them, and we have never been disappointed. I don't recommend groups larger than 10, though. Nor do I recommend it for a romantic proposal dinner.\n\nThis place is relatively expensive, so you're either aware of that and have a corporate account or, if you insist on dining here and cost is an issue, you need to \"order smart.\" In my experience, if you order a scallop dish in pretty much any decent restaurant in the country, you're going to get 4/5 medium to large scallops. Yes, it sounds skimpy, but this phenomenon isn't exclusive to Social House. As a general rule, my advice is to stay away from scallops, lobster, traditional steak, and anything resembling a California roll. Besides, there are usually much better items on a restaurant menu so don't be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone, especially at Social House. If you pay an extraordinary price, don't order ordinary food and expect to be dazzled.\n\nI will rank our group favorites, starting with the absolute top choices:\n\nYellowtail (hamachi) with jalapenos... this dish alone has converted many clients who claimed to dislike raw fish. Simple but absolutely heavenly. Order it, and don't shy away from the little sliver of jalapeno. It isn't that hot, even for a mild palate.\n\nMiso cod... trust me on this one, this is superb. It is a cooked dish, and both the texture and flavor are truly out of this world. Many people hesitate in trying, and yet they all come back for seconds.\n\nKobe sliders... yup, they are expensive. They are Kobe, after all. And they are really, really tasty.\n\nSeared tuna with ginger... also a very good choice. A classic but it is well done here.\n\nTocino short ribs... not your traditional ribs. The meat comes right off the bones, and the sauce is divine. \n\nSushi/sashimi in general is good, rolls are pretty standard. We always order this stuff last because the items above are so spectacular. Usually we end up wishing we hadn't ordered any rolls at all because we got our fill on everything else and a sushi roll just seems anti-climactic to our now-pleasantly flabbergasted palates.\n\nWarm chocolate cake... probably the best dessert available. We have not been fans of the Blueberry cake and the Lychee beignets were just OK. The mochi are pretty standard, but if you like mochi, go for it.\n\nAs for beverages... they have a few different mojitos that tend to go over very well. Sometimes a little too well. Fresh blueberry and pineapple are among the exotic mojito flavors available (they use real fruit). The cold floral sake was also a hit with most people, although you may wish to consult your waiter about the sake options as there are quite a few available.\n\nHappy socializing!"

So that's why I hang out with so many of them... to reap the benefits, over and over. \n\nSocial House did not disappoint! The evening couldn't have had a better start for our Bachelorette Party escapades. No longer located at Treasure Island, we were able to catch Social House during the first week of it's reopening in the swanky City Center next to Aria. The Manager stopped by our table to congratulate the beautiful bride-to-be and to offer shots for the table since we had the honor of being their first Bachelorette Party in their new location. Whoo! \n\nDonning pink tiaras, pink feather boas, and hoochie dresses, our six-pack of chicks got the party started knocking back choice cocktails and fancy sakes. Our super helpful waiter had tremendous patience explaining the menu to our drunk asses. We choose an assortment of sushi rolls, one of my favorites being the Crispy Kalbi Beef Roll. I was also digging the Sesame Kelp Salad. \n\nThe specialty cocktails were eclectic and worldly, but I think next time I'll stay Asian instead of delving into the South American... their Pisco Sour 2.0 was interesting but I still prefer the traditional version over their take with hibiscus syrup. The Red Champagne was delicious, especially if you like sweet and bubbly. The winner of the night was the sparkling blueberry sake by the name of Star Rabbit. It came in a little blue bottle with a hot pink label... delicious and a perfect fit for the theme of the night. I think we killed about 3 bottles of that stuff. \n\nSince we couldn't bring ourselves to leave, we decided to order dessert as well. The Milk Chocolate Cake was a hit with the table, but the Coco-Nuts a bit too out there for our palates. Also, an arrangement of chocolate truffles was sent out to our party which ensured that we left with full bellies. \n\nAfter passing out \"Hottest Jawline\" and \"Nicest Eyes\" stickers to our waiter, other waiters, the manager, and busboy, we left Social House and continued on elsewhere with our Bachelorette festivities. Not without a quick romp in the fountain outside Aria... watch out for those Star Rabbits!!!"

The service was okay, not super attentive, but my issues fall more with the 'mistakes' that occurred.  My sister-in-law is a celiac and cannot have any gluten products (tempura, soy sauce, etc...).  This was communicated and understood by our server, but when the sushi was delivered all rolls we put on one plate, meaning tempura flakes and soy spreading between the rolls.  Which rendered half of her rolls inedible and we sent some back to be placed on different plates.  My friend also asked for a glass of ice which took two requests over 10 or so minutes to get.\n\nHowever, the only thing that keeps me from making this a 2 star item is that the food was very good.  Strangely, the appetizer type items were stronger than many of the rolls.  The two appetizers we had (Tuna Tataki and the Yellowtail) were both very good.  Of the rolls we ordered I would recommend the salmon mango, but the hamachi was disappointing.\n\nOverall... perhaps better with straight easy orders, but if you have any dietary restrictions or allergies, I would beware."

I've been to so many Japanese restaurants all over the U.S., lived in Japan for some time, but I never came across such overpriced, over-hyped Japanese restaurant in my life. This place might have been a hip place back in the day, often visited by famous celebrities, and known for it's 'social' ambiance, but it must be the over-hype that made this place so highly rated. The interior is very nice, with a beautiful bar and dim lighting. The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable, helping to walk through the menu with you. Then, what is my problem? It's the food! I thought this was a restaurant? All-you-can-eat-sushi $8.99 restaurants can definitely make a better maki and roll than this place. We ordered Seared albacore tuna roll with spicy scallop and tuni maki, but it was bad. It was so bad that I was nearly shocked. We ordered snow crab dynamite as recommended by the waiter, and it was disgusting. It was simply fake crab meat covered with heavy cream and cheese that seemed semi baked. I really didn't know what I was eating. We ordered Jalapeno Hamachis, which were just terribly salted and covered with horrible sauce that tasted like East Asian medicine. I've had ceviches, I've had Japanese Hamachi (Yellowtail) and I clearly know the difference between the good and the bad. But, this was hard to categorize. I just don't know how they managed to make it so bad that it just broke out of my chart. After these dishes, I decided to stop ordering, and asked for the bill. It came out to $95 after taxes. My girlfriend and I are small eaters and I don't think we felt a thing in our stomach. \n\nFood- FAIL\nService- Good\nAmbiance- Good. Modern, hip.\nPrice- Overpriced. \n\nI think you should try this place for the hell of it. It's just so shocking, I almost want to suggest that you try this place. Drink a lot at the bar and sit, maybe you'll get through better. And that's if you don't care about the bill"

Then we ordered the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos, Citrus Peel Miso Cod, Shrimp, Spicy Tuna Battera roll, and a raspberry sorbet with crispy balls for dessert. The yellowtail sashimi and Citrus Peel Miso Cod was absolutely delicious! The sushi roll was typical and lacking flavor. It only looked unique because it was boxed shaped instead of a circle. The dessert was also really good too! The crispy balls had a creamy custard-like thing inside it. So the bill came out to be a total of $113. The atmosphere was nice here and the lighting of the place was a nice dim.

Halfway through ordering another round of drinks, I was lucid enough to question the server about the jalapeno yellowtail being a Nobu signature dish.  Apparently, as he informed me, the executive chef is from Nobu Las Vegas and was also at Nobu Next Door in NYC.  Phew, that made me feel much better!  The food itself was pretty good but for some reason, I remember the yellowtail sashimi being much better at Nobu Next Door, I think it was fresher there.  And the Kobe Beef Burgers sounded like they would be awesome, but they were kinda dry.  But, there was definitely a good selection of martinis that were really good.  Viva Las Vegas!"

Broth was okay, not particularly rich or creamy, but also not too salty (which is more of the traditional Japanese ramen broth style). Noodle was cooked, but still had clumps where it did not separate during the cooking process (sadly disappointing).  I liked the fried garlic pieces, which added to the flavor.  I would not add Sriracha, which they offered automatically, if I wanted it spicy.  (Pretty much the same experience that Candace C had 2 years ago).  Chasu was inconsistent.  One piece was light in color, with decent fat on it and was tender.  The other piece, was clearly darker, as if it had sat out unwrapped, and the exterior was also partly burnt (not just a nice seared, but charred to carbon).  Overall, it was not the Debbie N's ramen experience that I had hoped for. I trust both of these Yelpers' opinions, which are night and day differences, so consistency appears to be an issue.\n\nPrice:  For ramen it is more expensive than the other local ramen option, which we now have a lot.  So mega resort pricing in effect.\n\nI would like to come back and try other items on the menu, especially with 50% off dinner food purchases with their Social House Tomodachi (Friends of Social House) Card.

It was a good sized serving, especially considering all of the other items in the bento lunch, all for only $18! I found it to be a great deal for what it was. We were already inebriated from the gigantic drinks at Fat Tuesday, so we didn't get to sample the libations at Social House, but we WILL be back next time we're in town!"

The sushi rolls, fresh and inventive; the tuna tataki sublime. The menu is pretty extensive, and of course offers more than seafood. Another hit for our party, the delicious Kobe beef sliders.  \n\nThe atmosphere is sleek and I love how they've used what looks like steel drawers on the interior walls. My only complaints are that service was a bit rushed and the sake menu wasn't huge, in comparison to some San Francisco sushi spots."

The first thing we noticed is that the atmosphere in here is awesome: hip but comforting. Nice. We were seated quickly and got our orders in for the lunch special. While we waited for the courses to arrive, I sipped on a sake flight. Three generous pours for $20 is definitely not bad for Vegas, even if one was Ty-Ku. (Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that I can already get that one in Utah.) All the selections were rather pleasant and complimentary. \n\nSalad came first, and mine was the cucumber type while my fiance's was more of the usual type. Definitely a fresh and tasty way to start. But next came the star of our show, big bowls of rich, delicious pork bone broth, generous cuts of pork, tasty noodles, and even some egg (to make it even more decadent). It was accompanied by a bowl of garlic and other spices that we dumped in, and that really kicked it up a notch. I don't have anything to compare it to, but the flavor was just amazing. I was full, but yet I couldn't stop eating. It put me in a happy place. \n\nAfter that, the sushi rolls arrived. Did I mention that I was already full? I got the salmon and avocado roll and my fiance got the spicy tuna roll. We tried a little of each and were impressed by the quality of the fish. Very nice flavors. Unfortunately, it was just too much food and we weren't quite able to finish it. Not bad for $25 a piece. \n\nThe place was pretty empty by the end of our meal (it was a late lunch on a Monday), so we sat and sipped some tea for a bit. They have quite a good selections if you're into that sort of thing. We had one of the oolongs, which had a wonderful aroma and a nice, mellow flavor. \n\nI'll definitely be back here the next time I'm in town. I just wonder how long it'll be before I try something other than the ramen. That's the problem with not having this place closer."

Walking in and glancing at the prices I was a little concerned about budget. When I saw the sake menu I grew more concerned but decided to through caution to the wind and started to order a few items. Edamame to start and \"Star Rabbit\" sake, a fruity one that sounded different, curry rice, and chilled seaweed salad to start, add to that another bottle of sake and some house sushimi special with chili and mint finished with soft shell crab roll. Everything ordered tasted grand and we were not even the least bit upset by the $$$$ we ended spending.  Taste was excellent, very surprised!!!"

I didn't have high hopes since I just came back from Japan recently, but I surprised that the broth was really good. In fact, writing this review reminds me to go back tomorrow. Although, broth was very tasty, the downside was that the egg was not japanese style and seemed like someone through a practically raw egg in (which I don't necessarily mind, but I wanted authentic soy sauce egg).

First impression: hostess is a bitch.  I called for a reservation and the girl on the other end didn't sound particularly happy.  Said, \"Ok, you're all set,\" and just hung up.  I barely even got in a \"kthxbye.\"  We arrive and I'm assuming the hostess is the same girl who I spoke to on the phone.  No smile upon greeting us, and we later see her giving the  same shitty treatment to the party next to us.  A younger girl asked for water for her family on the table and is told coldly \"your server will be right with you.\"  \n\nOur actual server was nice enough.  The ikura & scallop nigiri was pretty good quality.  They were sadly out of uni.  Wouldn't recommend the angry tuna roll- the ponzu onion totally overshadowed the rest of the dish.  I tasted no spicy tuna, only pickled shit.  I guess you could say it made us angry!!  (Har har har)  We also had the garlic oil wagyu sashimi, which was tasty but also very expensive.  The rest of the food we ordered was aight- some vegetable tempura and the shichimi butter poached potatoes.  Oh, I was pleasantly surprised to see the potatoes were a huge portion, but upon further inspection, the bottom of the bowl was full of cabbage instead!  Haha!\n\nUpon leaving, we were thanked by 2 other staff members, but the hostess merely glanced at us and ignored us.  I have no idea why one would put this individual at the front of the house.  She seriously needs to go.  \n\nI wouldn't mind giving this place another chance, but I'd suggest Blue Ribbon for quality sushi nearby.  Their staff were all very friendly even when working on Christmas day!"

If you are looking to try new things and really enjoy what the restaurant has to offer they have a service where the waitress/waiter will ask for your likes, dislikes, allergies, and price range. Then they will custom create a menu for you. There is not picking involved. They bring out what they think are the best dishes according to YOUR taste. Everything is served family style and they bring out a dish about every 10 minutes until you are full. It is a great way to really enjoy the food you are eating and to feel super luxurious. Plus the servers are not overly aggressive. They give you your space and only check in before they bring out another dish to make sure your are still hungry. There were 5 of us and here is an idea of what we got: (not sure about some spelling)\n\nSeaweed Salad\nEdemame\nTuna Titaki\nYellow tail with Tempura Jalapeno\nCurry Lobster Salad\nScallops with Eggplant\nBraised Short Ribs\nTempura Shrimp\nSpecialty Roll\nLarge Dessert Platter \n\nWOW so much food and it was pretty affordable too! We got a mid-range bottle of Sake and tipped generously and it was $90 per person. Not too bad for being right on the strip with a VIP view of the Pirate Fights.\n\nEither way I will be visiting this restaurant EVERY time I am in Vegas and if I had the funds I would fly there just to eat another meal like I had."

Having no expections, we were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was excellent. The menu was a little limited, but it could have been due to the time of night we were dining. If I could I'd give Social House a 3.5 stars, but I can't. So I am giving them the benefit of the doubt. The real question is \"would I go back?\" Answer is \"probably\"."

To start we had the house salad with ginger dressing and seared tuna. That was pretty unremarkable. The tuna tataki and yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno was awesome though. I realllly liked the tempura jalapeno. So good. For entrees, we had kobe burgers (boring), arctic charr (the best dish, i thought), miso cod (the worst dish ... 3 days or whatever the length of marinade was, was far too long ...), and kalbi skewers (don't waste your money on these).  The meal was overall pretty good. The fire alarm went off like a million times, though. That was quite annoying. I wanted to sit on the patio, but we ended up sitting inside. Kim Kardashian and her crew sat next to us, so I guess our seats weren't that bad after all."

The seating is a bit weird because they have a bunch of little rooms and we ended up by this sushi bar and literally two inches from the table next to us. The wait staff was really cool and what is even cooler is that they serve Voss. Oh, how I heart Voss water. They also had a decent cocktail menu. The lycheetini was yummy and so was some green tea cocktail.\nWe started off with two sashimi apps -\nYellowtail with Jalapeno - the jalapenos were deep fried, so it was pretty tasty\nTuna Tataki Spicy Ponzu - nice and garlickey\n\nSushi -\nWe had some nigiri and it was ok.\nShrimp and Spicy Tuna Battera Box - beautifully made and actually quite tasty. I love the crunchy rice balls they had on the bottom of the roll. A very nice addition.\n\nEntrees -\nMiso Cod - It was ok\nPork Belly - Tasted pretty good. Nice and fatty.\nNoodles with Shrimp Tempura - The shrimps were nicely fried.\nThings were a bit pricey, but the food was tasty, the company was great...it was a great way to kick off a fab weekend in Vegas!"

It was very delicious - very fresh fish, real wasabi, and great service. It was so good that we went back for another meal on Sunday evening. This time, it was a completely opposite experience. \n\nWe ordered the sashimi platter again, but this time the fish was not fresh at all. The cut of tuna sashimi that they served was not only not fresh, but also a horrible cut with tendon and very chewy. I had a stomach ache after for an hour or so. \n\nWe also ordered two of the modern sashimi platters - one with Yellowtail and the other with albacore. It was obvious that it was not freshly made as the server brought it out literally 1 minute later, and it tasted like they just took it out of the fridge. Gross. \n\nWhen I asked why the fish was not fresh, the server just gave me some not relevant BS answer about how the fish is flown in from Alaska. Horrible service!\n\nI don't know what happened social house, but I was sorely very disappointed after many positive visits by my friends and I. We will not be back."

One of the things I absolutely hate about eating on the strip is the price. They gouge you on everything. So, I choose to eat elsewhere. Probably why it was bookmarked and I never made it there. Anyway, this place is pretty nice. I doubt I would come for dinner because I'm sure it's insanely expensive, but I really did enjoy my lunch. \nIt's got a nice sexy, cozy vibe when you enter. There is a bar and a seating area which has chairs and love seats. Something about love seats around a table is so cool to me. They have a bigger room in the back for large parties too. We choose to sit in the front area. We ordered the sunomo (cucumber salad) and a house green salad. Both were excellent. The sesame seeds on the sunomo were spot on! Both were delicious and refreshing. Next, we got the shrimp tempura and the seafood ramen. Both were very tasty. I was surprised and impressed that the soup came with 2 extra large shrimp and 6 clams. The tempura came with 3 shrimp and a couple of veggies. Last, we had the spicy tuna roll and the veggie roll. I'm not really into raw fish but the spicy tuna was DELICIOUS!!! The veggie roll was good too, but I think the spicy tuna was better.\nThe service was great too. Our glasses were filled throughout the meal. They came over and cleared out plates pretty quickly, asked how everything was. \nSo, for $20 a person, you cant' beat it. Well, if it was $15 you could, hahaha. \nThey sneak in upgrades on the pre fixe menu where you can order salmon teriyaki and a few other things for an additional $5. I'd rather they just put it on the menu for $20 or take it off. It's sneaky and that's the only thing I didn't like. \nI'd probably come back for the lunch special. It's daily, including Sundays (but that's what daily mean, except to some places that mean Mon-Fri) from 12-3 or 12-5."

The waitress lead us upstairs for a table of two at the  corner. The interior design and ambiance was very nice. A little too dark, that we couldn't see our food clearly. May be because we sat in the corner.\n\nAs soon as we sat down, a waiter came and asked us if we would like some water. We said yes and he asked \"sparkling or plain?\" And I said sparkling. At the end when we got the bill, $7.50 was charged for that bottle of water. I was not happy about that service as he didn't mention sparkling water is not free. As a high-end restaurant like this, this is not a good customer service. So I took out one star for the service.\n\nWe ordered two Social House rolls: shrimp, spicy tuna battera $20 for 6 pcs; and hamachi, chilies cilantro, garlic chips with citrus soy sauce $12 for 6 pcs. Both rolls were just ok, just a decent Japanese roll. For hot dishes, we ordered pan peared sea scallop, nasu miso, curry emulsion $26 for 6 pcs, citrus peel miso cod $22, and searing tuna with Social House ginger dressing $24. All of them were yummy, but the portions were small. \n\nWe also ordered a small bottle of cold sake called \"Rihaku Wandering Poet\" $38, which was the best sake I've ever had so far! Finally, we ordered crispy ice cream $10 for dessert. We substituted with coffee ice cream. The ice cream was wrapped with crunchy sweet corns and taro sweet paste served on the side. Delicious!\n\nIt is a fusion Japanese restaurant, so don't come here for authentic Japanese food. Also I think their hot dishes are much better than the sushi rolls. Unfortunately, I think the food is a bit overpriced. Otherwise, it worth going there again."

I wouldn't say it blew me away, but gauged on food alone, this place would definitely be a 4-star.\n\nThe service was good. No complaints, but nothing exceptional.\n\nThe ambiance inside the restaurant was cozy, up-scale Asian, but most of that falls flat when half the restaurant is an open veranda looking out on a Mall. We sat right by the Mason-Dixon line between upscale, fresh restaurant and Mall sterility and it killed it for me.\n\nThis is gonna be an uncharacteristically short review for me, because while there was nothing majorly wrong with this place (besides the location), there wasn't really that much that put it above, above-average. Vegas these days is a hive of culinary endeavors and you can do better, but don't sweat it if this is your only option."

It is delectable.  Across the entire menu, there is sushi perfection to be discovered.  Light, fresh and flavorful.  This is artisan sushi in a setting that is exotically Asian with a little Vegas ambience.  The big eye Tuna pizza is the reason to come, but the tuna special sashimi style is where you will find bliss.  Their albacore garlic is a tap dance on my tastebuds.

Coming here was a good choice. We ordered the sunrise, salmon and avocado, and spicy tuna rolls and they were all very good. The bf particularly enjoyed the spicy tuna a lot as it was not the normal \"paste\" that sushi restaurants usually incorporate into the rolls, but real spicy tuna pieces. The sunrise roll was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the touch of lemon that was on top. I did, however, think that there was too much mayo inside of the sunrise roll. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the panko-crusted truffle cake, which was deep fried and had a decadent chocolate lava filling inside. I was not expecting that much from the dessert, but it was spectacular. The chocolate tasted a bit dark and the cake itself was yummy, for having panko in it (not used to it being in a dessert). \n\nWe also tried their unfiltered sake (momokawa) and it was pretty good. I'm not a fan of sake and I liked it (:\n\nPrices are high as this restaurant is located in the Crystal shopping mall next to Aria, but service is very friendly and the food is great. Also note that this is a fusion tapas restaurant, which means small portions. The sunrise roll had 8 pieces and the other two had 6 I believe. Sunrise was on the speciality roll list, so it was $22. The other two were cheaper, around $12. Will consider coming back for their prix fixe lunch next time."

I saw a small sushi bar open and asked the hostess how long the wait was, and to my surprise she said they had tables free, all upstairs.  Whoa...they have an upstairs?  Being completely blinded by the glitz and glam of Vegas, i didn't' realize that this was a full blow restaurant.\n\nThe walk up the staircase to the main dining areas makes you feel like you're in a bank, as golden safety deposit boxes surround you.  The Asian decor when you hit the rooms is very subtle in some rooms, and very traditional in others.  The atmosphere is really fitting for the name of the place.  Things get really lively too if you get the outdoor patio seating that overlooks the strip.\n\nThe food is absolutely awesome here.  If you're picky about sushi, get whatever they have that's fresh here.  The ahi and hamachi were fabulous, and the salmon excellent.  Flown in all the way from Japan overnight, we got lucky with our batch of sashimi.  however the hidden gem are the mini-Kobe Beef sliders.  OMG, heaven on a King-Hawaiian roll.  The flavor,the texture, the taste.......ecstasy on the tongue I tell you (OK....that could've been put differently, but let's move on).  \n\nIf you need a buzz and want some exotic tastes in liquid form, they offer so many different types of sakes that you won't find at your regular sushi bar down the street.  There's over fifteen unique ones and if I had more time, I'd have tried them all.\n\nPricey, but very much worth it."

The sashimi was pretty but I could barely pick it up with my chopsticks it was so small. The atmosphere was great but walked away with a bad taste in my mouth as we let the manager know of our less than satisfied experience, and nothing was done in response. He/she didn't even make an appearance at our table for an apology. This restaurant obviously does not take pride in quality and customer satisfaction. Go here if you want to watch your money get wasted on $4 sushi."

It is located inside crystals mall so it is also great for people watching.\n\nIf you want a more upscale dinner then the restaurant is perfect. It is dimly lit and has a sensual vibe.  It is a little on the pricier side but everything is delicious.  Some of my favorites are the yellowtail sashimi, big eye tuna pizza, Maguro tartar, citrus miso cod, and the Kobe gyoza.  The rock shrimp is amazing and is definitely my favorite dish!\n\nAs far as sushi rolls my favorites are: salmon mango roll, seared albacore roll, and the angry tuna roll."

            "review": "4 STARS (rounded down from 4.49 stars)! If it weren't for both the terrible service and drinks it would have been 5 stars.\n\nAfter reading some of the so-so reviews on Yelp, me and my bf didn't have high expectations of Social House, but we were \"WOWED\" by the food. Considering it's an Asian Fusion restaurant, the dishes far surpassed the ones we had at Okada at The Wynn and Sushi Roku at Caesar's Palace...\n\nThis was the first place we hit up after our flight landed on Friday, 12/5. We arrived at 10:30 PM for our reservations and were seated promptly. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor was trendy and upbeat. I would not expect anything less for an upscale LV restaurant. What stood out the most was the wall filled with gold drawers by the staircase, which was reminiscent of the drawers you would find in a Chinese Herb store. The patio overlooks the TI Pirate Show--the perfect place to sit if the weather was hot. The only complaint I had was the tables were too close too each other, so you can hear your neighbor's entire conversation and they can hear yours. \n\nThe restaurant was not busy at this time, but it took about 10-15 minutes, for our server, Danny/Donnie (?) to even show up. But, more on that later.\n\nOn to the food and drinks...\n\nCOCKTAILS: \n*Green Tea Lemonade: Gross, it was very bitter and hard to drink.\n\n*Ginger Saketini: Even worse. It was super sweet and you couldn't taste the alcohol. It was so sweet that it was like drinking syrup.\n\nFOOD:\n*Yellowtail with Crispy Jalape\u00f1os: EXCELLENT; the BEST SASHIMI EVER. The yellowtail was fresh and melted in your mouth. The warm tempura battered jalape\u00f1o was a perfect compliment to the yellowtail. A big thanks to the Yelpers out there who recommended this dish!\n\n*Kobe Sliders: EXCELLENT. Yes, it's expensive ($24) for three white castle sized burgers with tempura battered onion rings, but well worth it. The kobe was tender and melted in your mouth. That in between the slightly sweet toasted bun and ponzu (?) mayo was an AMAZING combination. The onion rings were light and crispy, not too oily. \n\n*Uni with Quail Egg: OMG GOOD! The uni was massive and incredibly fresh. The quail egg on top of that was buttery heaven. I always judge a restaurant by the quality of their Uni. And, Social House's Uni is definitely one of the best we've ever tasted. For about $10/piece, I guess it better be. :)\n\n*Hamachi Roll: Very Good; it was fresh and buttery and paired very well with the garlic chips and citrus soy. It also had a nice kick to it.\n\n*Shrimp Spicy Tuna Battera Roll: Ehh, could have passed on this one. This roll was topped with cooked shrimp and filled with spicy tuna that was NOT spicy. It was very bland.\n\n*Carrot Cardamon Cake with Pistachio Ice Cream: OMFG--One word that best describes this dessert to a \"T\": is ORGASMIC!!! This is ABSOLUTELTY THE BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER HAD. The carrot cake came out warm, crisp on the outside, and was topped with toasted carrots, alongside cream cheese fraiche. Once you cut into it, you find yourself with an incredibly moist, light, and flavorful cake. \n\nOne spoonful of the cake, a little of the cream cheese fraiche and a sprinkle of the toasted carrots with a tiny scoop of the pistachio ice cream carrot=ORGASM in your mouth. The flavors went very well together and the different textures (crunchy, warm, rich) were AMAZING.  The pistachio ice cream was OoOoo La La; this was the richest ice cream I've ever tasted! \n\nSERVICE: \nNeeds a major overhaul. From start to finish, the service was terrible. This should have been an indication when entering Social House, and we were faced with 3 zombie-like hostesses. \n\nMy bf and I are not high maintenance; we order and eat quickly, clean up after ourselves, and leave right afterwards. So, when it comes to service, all I ask is to get nicely greet with a smile, promptly take our orders, and check on us just once. \n\nWe got none of the above from Danny/Donnie (?), our server. He was no where to be found for the first 10-15 minutes (it was not busy at the time). When he did come, Danny/Donnie had  an expression on his face that read: \"F***, it's Friday Night and I don't want to be here. And, since I'm miserable, I might as well let everyone else feel the same way\" look on his face. \n\nC'mon dude, this is you job; I've done retail for 4 years, and the least you can do is \"fake\" it. After he took our orders, we didn't see him for the rest of the night. \n\nApparently, we weren't the only ones who felt this way. The table next to us who also had Danny/Donnie said he was not deserving of any tip. \n\nThe rest of the staff is just like him; young, snooty, and arrogant (except for the bus boys). Geez, people--does it hurt to crack a smile?!?!?! \n\nHopefully, when we come back again in the Summer (and we'll definitely be back for the FOOD), they will have new friendlier staff. If this is the case, and the food is consistent, I'll definitely change my rating to 5 STARS!"

I had one glass of wine, and split 2 rolls, a couple of pieces of sashimi and some waaaaay over-salted vegetable tempura with my friend, and we each had to dish out $45. I mean, that is absolutely insane. For mediocre food and hardly any of it, I was kind of choked. \n\nThe ambiance was ok. Trendy and contemporary.

Light, citrus, elegant. It was so good to start off. Wish the serving was bigger by just one more scallop, it was that good.\n\nSecond course-Salmon Tartare: Scottish Salmon, Ginger Miso, Taro Chip\nIncredible! Our favorite of the night, the sauce put it over the top. Probably our favorite of the night.\n\nThird course- Oyster Trio: Kumamoto Oyster, Yama Imo Dashi, Soho Salsa, Ponzu Gelee\nVery good, could taste the different flavors across 3 fresh oysters in a half shell. The house oyster was very tasty.\n\nFourth Course-Ginger Sweetbreads: Crispy Veal Sweetbreads, Sweet Ginger Scallion Sauce, Fuji Apples, Baby Radish\nOne of my favorites, well seasoned. The sauce put it over the top as a winner. The sweetbreads nicely fried, the sauce was so good!\n\nFifth Course-Citrus & Fennel Toothfish: Chilean Seabass, Blood Orange Vinaigrette, Pear Tomato, Mizuna.\nVery good! The fish melts in your mouth, the sauce delicious and the fennel adds a dash of freshness.\n\nSixth Course-Angus 300 Petite Tenderloin: Angus 300 Tenderloin, Fole Fried Rice, Bacon Wrapped Enoki Mushroom, Soho Steak Sauce\nAlmost perfect! Great piece of beef, excellent sauce, flavorful rice but too much rice, about half the size of the rice would have been perfect. I can see how this might be OK as an entree but for a tasting there was too much rice.\n\nSeventh Course-Cher's Nigiri Sushi: Tai, Kanapachi, Maguro, Aji, Ebi\nGood sushi, the rice was too much after the previous dish. Would have been perfect just as a small serving of sashimi. Still good!\n\nEighth course-Banana cake, Peanut Buter Mousse, Valrhona Chocolate Pearls, Banana Ice Cream, Bacon Chips.\nZING! Such a delicious and well balanced dessert! Moist cake, smooth peanut butter mouses, excellent banana ice cream and perfectly crispy bacon bits. Great way to finish off the tasting menu.\n\nOverall, I'm a big fan, we had a great culinary experience. We'll definitely return here again for some of the chef's special dishes. Nice atmosphere, I think the dance music could have been replaced with something else to create a more elegant atmosphere but there were lots of people just getting rolls and drinks that night on NYE so I guess it fit. The staff is excellent and very helpful."

We were seated immediately, at a table outside with a perfect view for the silly pirate show.  We all decided we would get the Chef's tasting menu, and it couldn't have been a better choice.  \n\nWe had an amazing 8 course meal, whose highlight was a trio of oh-toro tapas that were the second best oh toro I've ever had (the best is at Morimoto's in Philly).  I will say that the sushi course was a little boring and tame in comparison, so maybe thats why everyone is hating on the sushi.  \n\nThe service was great, and I think it's a good thing to be hovered over by your server.  Too many times, I've been to a high priced place and waited for more than 10 minutes to even see my server.  Why would you complain about having 3 servers right there at your beck and call?"

Their social hour menu features deep discounts on drinks and appetizers ($5-9 per plate as opposed to $15-18 normally).  We didn't have a reservation, we were just looking for a place to grab a bite before going to see a show.  \n\nThe location is a little weird - inside the Crystals mall across from Stella McCartney - but that didn't detract from its atmosphere, which is otherwise cool, understated, and fashionable.  I'm not sure why the hostess asked for my first and last name before seating us, because she didn't ask for any contact info afterwards to solicit feedback on our experience... oh well.  \n\nThe service was prompt and multiple waiters were constantly coming to our table to ask if we needed anything else.  Our waiter was also very knowledgable about the menu and components of each dish.  \n\nThere's a moderately sized bar area where a group of women were gathered for the happy hour drink specials... most were dressed in cocktail dresses ready to take on the town, but a few were in yoga pants and fluorescent headbands.  One of the less attractive consequences of a mall location, I guess.  \n\nTried the tonkotsu ramen from the social hour menu, which is a full size bowl for $8 but does not include any of the usual add-ins... you can add pork belly, poached egg, fish, and other things for an additional fee.  It wasn't the BEST ramen I've EVER had (once you've had Underbelly in SD, other ramens just don't compare) but it was definitely palatable.  The Thai beef lettuce wraps appetizer was definitely large enough to share.  Also ordered the salmon tartare (which came with taro chips) and Crispy Pata, very pleased with both."

Perhaps it was their intent that one person be served and complete eating their meal before the second person was served in order to facilitate socializing, but we would have been much happier being served at the same time.\n\nThe green tea brewed too long before it was served, and it was quite bitter.  Refills on water and other beverages were hard to come by.  Miso soup and Bento box were served at the same time with no real explanation for the delay or the inability to serve the soup first, as is customary.\n\nOn the upside? The food tasted great!

This spot is located inside the Crystals Mall just off the sky bridge - so one downside is that you don't get to enjoy the spectacle of the Strip.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the Social House roll and the Lobster Tempura roll.  I also enjoyed the sashimi assortment (but not the scallops).\n\nThe part that I don't get is that this is raw fish wrapped in rice.  Maybe my palette just is not developed enough, but I can't really tell the difference - once wrapped in rice with a sauce on top - between a piece of tuna here and a piece at the takeout sushi joint by my house.  Except for the fact that our party of five spent $250 more for dinner here and only one of us drank.\n\nThat being said, you are not going to find a cheap sushi joint on the Strip, so - if you are in the mood for sushi - Social House will more than satisfy your cravings."

Well, we showed up at 8pm on a Saturday night and there was no reservation in our name - not sure who's fault that is though. So luckily there was a table set up in their bar area and we were able to squeeze our group of 5.\n\nService was a bit random, our waitress was pretty weird and would start a conversation and then just walk away. When asked what she recommended, she didn't have much to say. My friend waited at least 5 minutes to get her attention to get some soy sauce - he had just ordered sushi so it was a bit awkward for him to wait while we started eating.\n\nThe food was pretty solid though - we got the edamame, the potstickers which were good and the tempura veggies, also good. I got the ribeye steak. it was a lot of meat and properly cooked, but I should have noted that it was going to be drenched in teryaki sauce. The shoestring potatoes were just sprinkled over the top (they're not like french fries). The others at my table seemed to enjoy their food as well, getting the short ribs, the miso cod, the tuna pizza and sushi.\n\nThe food was pretty solid, but the service was definitely a bit off."

We're all very avid sushi lovers, we ordered both cut rolls as well as hand rolls, when it came out, quite fast for a large order, about 16 rolls in total the rice was COLD, not lukewarm or even chilled, but so cold that when I ate one my mouth only recognized the chill not the flavor. I ordered the $40 roll with Kobe and sent my entire order back. The other guys were starving so they at theirs but agreed it was Chinese buffet quality. I complained to the manager and they only took my uneaten order off the bill and offered no consolation for anyone else. Our bill was $250 for something you could buy at Harris Teeter market. NOT Happy."

Then you choose from a various of teriyaki chicken and other meat dishes or ramen. Since our group were mostly hungover lol we pretty much all opted for the ramen. And then the third course are consists of a either salmon avocado, spicy tuna or tempura roll. \n\nThe miso soup was so salty and the flavor was just.. a weird indescribable flavor that I can't explain but it just was not good. The ramen wasn't horrible, edible but I wouldn't say it's anything special. It does come with some spice and roasted garlic flakes on the side that's really delicious in the ramen. The spicy tuna roll was eh. Nothing special, but not bad.\n\nDecor is good, pretty fancy and service is good. But food was eh. Price is decent, well for vegas."

Nothing really stood out to me here, and yes, I have had some great renditions of this simple dish :)\n\nTonkotsu Ramen Noodles ($5 add). This was delicious! Much better than I was expecting actually. The Pork was cooked to a crisp on the edges, so it had a nice consistency and flavor, but the insides were a little less tender than others around town.  Solid choice though!\n\nThird Course : Spicy Tuna Roll. This was ok...decent flavor in the roll and fish tasted fresh.  Don't expect anything out of the ordinary here.\n\nAnd to finish, I wasn't sure if I was going to order dessert or just a drink.  But when I saw this choice on the menu, it seemed like a good mix of both :\n\nBlue Yuzu Ice Cream Float ($15): Grey Goose Le Citron, Blue Curacao, Fresh Yuzu Juice, Virgils Cream Soda and Vanilla Ice Cream. This was surprisingly tart from the yuzu juice. It was very overpowering, so if you aren't a fan of yuzu, stay away! If you enjoy yuzu though, it's pretty tasty...just very tart.\n\nOverall, lunch felt a tad spendy at $25+, but considering the location and how good the Ramen was, I would say it was worth it!\n\nGive it a try...esp if you are craving ramen in the area :)\n\nPics:"

Don't fall for it because you can try just a few and still enjoy the experience without being hungry.  We tried:\n\n- A special off-the-menu appetizer the waiter suggested with thinly sliced tuna, green pepper oil, and crispy scallions.  AMAZING!\n- Scallop dish with Japanese eggplant and vanilla foam which was cooked very well, but the sweet foam weirded me out a bit.\n- Kobe Sliders, which normally comes with 3 and some tempura-style onion rings with banana ketchup (normally yuck, but it was very lightly flavored) and some kind of citrus mayonnaise.  This dish ROCKED.\n- A lobster California roll, adobo chicken roll, and a spicy tuna with shrimp roll which were just so-so and not as well-made as I would have expected (not very tightly rolled).  I would actually skip most of the rolls unless there's something really fantastic that you can't live without.\n\nThe hot and cold appetizers are really where it's at.  I can't say much for the raw sushi items because we didn't try any, but the rolls were a bit of a disappointment.  However, it's a great atmosphere and very trendy without being too shi-shi.  It's by no means cheap, but you could probably get away with $50-60 a head and be satisfied.  \n\nP.S.  Make reservations, especially for large groups in advance!"

It would be a great place for an intimate dinner with a significant other. I would not recommend for families or people with children. \n\nThis sushi restaurant was a bit on the pricey end but completely worth every dollar spent!\nImagine my comfort level when our waitress explained she also struggles with a gluten intolerance and was well aware of how to prepare the foods and when to check on items to make sure I was safe. \n\nShe answered all my questions about the menu and made me feel extremely safe about eating there. When I had questions she didn't know the answer, she immediately went back to the kitchen to ask the chef to ensure I was staying gluten free! \n\nI decided to try the most expensive roll in the place - it had gold flakes on it! Kobe beef, king crab and yellow fin were some of the meats in this roll. It tasted like magic. I loved it and every single thing about it was phenomenal. I hadn't spent a lot of money so far on food during the trip so I decided to take a splurge. \n\nWe also had roasted mini potatoes that were seasoned so perfectly and roasted to the greatest crispiness ever that we were all fighting over them at the table. \n\nEveryone at the table enjoyed different sushi rolls that were each equally delicious in their own way. (or so I was informed by the non-celiacs) \n\nIf you are in Las Vegas looking for a unique, delicious dinner and aren't worried about the price tag - I would highly recommend Social House for dinner."

It was perfect - spicy, crispy, chewy, contrasty, yummy with a different note from baby cilantro ad a sliver of jalape\u00f1o.\n\nHamachi with jalapeno was a touch different also, the sliver of pepper deep fried. It was (rather surprisingly) a nice generous portion, and the fish was pristine.\n\nThe shishito peppers were the usual fun tasty game of palette roulette but they had an added element which the menu said was lemon miso. Not sure I got the lemon note, but it was really good.\n\nAnd finally the duck buns, hoison sauced duck on chewy bao buns with pickled cucumbers, are divine. \n\nGood sake list,  some interesting cocktails, and very attentive service round out what was an almost perfect experience.\n\nThe down sides: the salad dressing on the house salad was grotesque - they'd be far better off using bottled ginger dressing.  And the usual Vegas WTF over music - house-trance club music blasting throughout the restaurant with no refuge (maybe under the tables?) - what's up with that? If you're dropping $125+ per head on dinner is it really necessary to try and annoy you so you want to get up and go ASAP (that seems to be the Vegas dining plan). \n\nBut all in all a great place - based on this a notch better than Koi or Nobu."

It was a good portion, (I didn't finish my roll) and the egg was perfectly poached and was a great added flavor and texture to the dish. The pork belly appeared sparing but was actually a perfect sized portion for the bowl. \n\nThe scallop sushi was a disappointment. I wanted a chopped spicy scalloped, and thought that is what I asked for when I ordered and asked the bartender about it but when it arrived it was a scallop split in half over rice with the dab of wasabi on the rice. The scallop was okay, I was expecting it to at least have a sweetness to it but it wasnt. The roll was not worth it's price. For a happy hour i would say the price/portion size was disaapointing. \n\nBest things were the ramen and my $3 blue moon. Atmosphere is nice dark woods and reds, good sized bar and lounge area.

The hours make Social House a great option either pre or post an evening out on the town.  The seating and lighting are tastefully elegant, but understated -- a rare find in Vegas.  The sushi bar is equally well done, and great for those few times you're in the city alone.\n\nThere are two bars in the restaurant, one closest to the north end of the property; which is great for small groups that want to eat/socialize; and one on the other end -- a little louder but a great spot for some drinks afterwards.  Other seating options consist of indoor seating alcoves (small groups of seats,) indoor seating areas with traditional table arrangements; and outdoor seating.  Outdoors is probably a better option for large groups or for folks that don't mind noise, as you will hear the pirate ship show going on outside if you choose to be seated there.\n\nThe staff are very efficient and knowledgeable, and the food competitively priced for a typical upscale, quality experience.  My water glass was never empty -- and my drink wasn't either for that matter!\n\nI've had multiple dishes in this restaurant -- everything from the standard rolls and sashimi fare -- but would highly recommend the Hamachi Jalape\u00f1o dish from the menu.  It's a house specialty, with the Hamachi tastefully cut thin, placed in a sauce, with small chips of jalape\u00f1o on the top that have been flash-fried.  It sounds a bit odd, but the fusion of tastes is amazing -- and a great appetizer for a group.\n\nThe well-stocked bar is not that uncommon for Vegas, but the selection of Saki definitely is -- you'll find what you want (both from a food and beverage perspective) here at this establishment.\n\nSocial House tends to get busy during peak periods, so reservations are suggested based on my experience.

Granted, the sashimi was excellent, slurping down $25 in 30 seconds was a bit ridiculous. On the plus side, the lychee martini ($14) was the best I've ever had. Our total bill (3 drinks, 6 pieces of sashimi, 2 rolls was $103 with tax, before tip."

Decent quality, unique atmosphere, good service ( thanks Frank and Matt ), and a bonus outdoor dining area that directly overlooks the strip.  It's hip, chic, and elegant at the same time.  Whatever they were going for, it works.  I didn't have much time before we had to head to Pam Anderson's party at LAX so we decided to forgo the unique structuring of cold, hot, and sushi courses that they recommended - which was very innovative by the way.  Instead we chopped through kobe tataki rolls (explosive ), mixed sashimi, and curry lobster rolls.  Pairing it with a bottle of the german riesling didn't turn out too bad either.   I'll probably be back here again."

The Social House is located inside the posh Crystals City Center mall on the Strip, and there was more than enough class and sass (and a little bit of poser trash) present during our dinner. The interior was absolutely gorgeous, with creative chandelier fixtures and beautiful wall art. Their dishes are meant to be shared, but I had a couple of dishes that I definitely wanted to keep to myself...they were just that good. First, I had some lovely Classic Cucumber Saketini. It was great; not too sweet, and absolutely refreshing. I chose a couple of small plates, including the salmon tartare, crispy tofu, and kobe sushi. They were all quite delicious, although my absolute favorite was the tartare. It was just so fresh, and well-seasoned, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. There are a lot of upscale dining experiences in Las Vegas, and even more \"bang for your buck\" restaurants that can make one's head explode. This is definitely the former, and a estimable option at that."

There was only 1 other table seated inside and nobody in the lounge.  Also, I thought that it wasn't that easy to find.  Crystals is pretty massive, and the restaurant is on the backside of the 2nd level, near Wolfgang Pucks.\n\nAnyhow, I really like the decor and the lighting.  This would be a great place to go on a date.  The hostess was very friendly and welcoming, and our server approached us immediately.  She was happy to answer any questions the group had and also to make recommendations.  The only down side was being told that the kitchen was making \"last call,\" when we hadn't really had enough time to look over the menu.  We also had to decide if we wanted dessert BEFORE we ordered.  But, I guess that's what happens when you are the last reservation of the night.\n\nI am not a big sushi eater, so there isn't much I can say in that regard.  However, the rest of my group ordered rolls and a sashimi platter and they really liked everything.  Their favorite was the angry tuna.  I had the hamachi tartare, which had a great \"kick\" to it and the garlic dust was an amazing addition.  I also ordered the kobe tacos, which were PHENOMENAL.  I don't know what they do to them, and I feel like an idiot ordering kobe tacos at a Sushi restaurant....But I swear, they were amazing.  The shells were homemade and had a nice crunch to them.  The beef wasn't greasy at all, and the pickled cantaloupe was an awesome addition. I also tried the SH Red Champagne, which was refreshing and delicious.  The hibiscus flower in the bottom is a nice garnish, and edible too.  Although, I thought it tasted like a soggy fruit roll up (not necessarily a bad thing haha).\n\nI thought the prices were pretty typical for a strip sushi restaurant.  Nothing seemed TOO outrageous, IMO.  Also, there was the strangest mix of music playing, I didn't think it matched the restaurant at all.\n\nOverall, I loved the ambiance and the service was great.  I would definitely go back and I will definitely recommend it to friends who visit from out of town."

According to a Yelper this was the best time to order the Omakase, so the chefs could go crazy and get creative. Omakase it was. I told our server that I can't have any thing breaded or with flour because I am gluten intolerant and will get sick. Note this for later in the review and what bumped them down to two stars. \n\nThe first three courses were great, really inventive and good flavor. The 4th course was a very nicely prepared, but very typical miso black cod and not something I would expect on their \"chef's choice creation\" menu. The next dish was a pork dish and the pork was a bit dry. Flavor was a bit bland. Then the \"sushi\" course was truly disappointing. Usually one orders the omakase expecting some inventive stuff. This was just a plate of salmon sushi, yellowtail sushi, tuna sushi, red snapper sushi, and some other fish. No special anything. Just a piece of fish on the rice. \n\nThen came dessert. Tres leches CAKE. With flour. I told the server that I couldn't eat it and they replaced it with a mango pudding. \n\nOur server was super nice, but at times was a bit slow coming by our table, etc. It wasn't even that busy so I can't really let that slide either. \n\nOverall really over priced for the mediocrity that its food was. Service was middle of the road, but a big ding for them by serving me a glutenous dessert."

The guy insisted on ordering for me: sunomono (cucumber) salad (the size of a soy sauce dish) and 1 order of tamago (egg) sushi that he split with me.  No joke!  We sat outside and that was my first view of the siren show, ugh.  After that I tore off to Godiva in Fashion Show and bought myself chocolate.  Good riddance.  Fast forward, Social House left TI, and I forgot about it.  Then I was in Crystals one day walking around and saw an ad for desserts in restaurants there.  The yuzu frangipane called my name.\n\nLast night Eric R. and I attended a really cool event at Social House in Crystals.  It was a sake lesson from a sake sommelier, paired with different bites from the food menu.  First we had junmai premium sake paired with yellowtail sashimi with tempura jalapeno, garlic dust, tiny cilantro, and calamansi soy.  Did someone say tempura jalapeno slices?  Yes indeedy.  Next, we sampled another sake, some higher level, paired with big eye tuna sashimi, sweet chili sauce, crispy shallot, red onion, and negi oil.\n\nThe next dish was amaaaaazing: nasu spicy miso: small delicate roasted Japanese eggplant with spicy miso glaze.  This was truly delicious!!!  Our last dish was a set of rolls: salmon avocado, hama-chimi (hamachi, avocado, jalapeno-cilantro chimichurri, garlic chips), and negi toro (fatty tuna with green onion).  Our final sake was Ty-Ku coconut flavored nigori (unfiltered).  This was actually really delicious.  I have long been a coconut fan but I am on a huge coconut kick lately.  This one is worth purchasing, and I can get it at Total Wine or Lee's according to the sommelier.\n\nThis ended up being a really fun event.  At the end, I ordered the yuzu frangipane, which is made to order because it is a molten cake!  Warm almond cake, molten yuzu cream cheese filling, raspberry sorbet, almond toffee, and fresh raspberries.  It was tasty, more like almond than yuzu.  The idea of it is really good, but I am looking for yuzu to punch my taste buds, so this in the end was not quite yuzu-y enough for me :) and it cost $12.  Anyway, I would come back for some bites here, especially that eggplant!"

Needless to say they really had to iron out the kinks.  I order this kabab sushi roll and was brought this beef kabab instead. I explained it to the person who brought it to me that it wasn't what I ordered. I spoke to the waiter and he said that the roll was coming soon. After 20 min and still no roll. We suposesidly had two different waiters and the communication between the two was terrible.  No one seemed to check on the roll since each one assumed the other was checking already (even though they said they would check...obviously they did not). Finally after 30 min the manager came by to appologize for the mix up.  The two waiter/waitress system just doesn't work!!\n\none star: $5 soda!!!  Big $$$$ for tiny kabab."

            "review": "When I think sushi, I think all different kinds of fish & toppings. The sushi I ordered at social house- salmon roll and spicy tuna roll were like rolls you can go to the local supermarket and buy. (I, personally would never do that) They were good, but they were so plain and boring. For the price of each roll- you think they would have been spectacular, especially since they are on the menu under \"specialty rolls\" when there was nothing special about them. \n\nI got the lunch combo for $20. Salad to start off with, it was good. Dressing was good. Second part was the seafood ramen soup. This was interesting. I am a big seafood fan, so I liked it just fine. It had the weird imitation fish floating flower shaped spongy things in it. Never eat those anyways. It had clams, shrimp, mushrooms, ramen noodles, and they give you a side of two different spices one was red and one was a  yellow black color. Didn't know what either of them were, I just tried them on my finger and then dumped them in. I liked the soup. I would order it again if I got the lunch deal. Lastly I got salmon sushi. Plain. Meh. Have had better in little ol' Redding, CA. I had to order an additional roll because I knew I wouldn't be full from the small portions of the lunch special. However, the soup was not small. It was in a rather large bowl with a lot of noodles. (still ate it all)\n\nHusband ordered the $20 lunch special as well, got a spicy tuna roll, deep fried shrimp/veggie tempura, and miso soup. He also ordered an additional spicy tuna roll. He tried a wasabi bloody mary. THAT was interesting. He loves wasabi, so he liked it. I hate wasabi so no thank you. I think it was a $15 tall skinny cup dinky drink. A little while after drinking it he said it gave him an upset stomach. It was probably 90% tomato juice aka bloody mary mix 5% wasabi & 5% alcohol.. (another guy in our group ordered it and said it gave him an upset stomach as well) :-P yuck, IMO.\n\nThe decor inside was really nice and pleasing to the eyes. The lighting was dark. It was cool and relaxing with music playing low in the background, almost too romantic for our loud group of friends. They were very friendly, didn't take very long for us to get food and the service was good.\n\nWe ended up spending about 86$ between the two of us. Not including tip. We left $100 bill. IMO that was way overpriced for the stomach ache drink and the boring sushi. I don't even recall if I ordered a drink. I wouldn't seek out this restaurant again just because I like colorful, flavorful sushi. I had to ask for a side of Sriracha to go with my sushi because it was boring. It's not that it was bad by any means, but if you like boring sushi or California rolls (basically the same thing), this place could be for you!"

He said because some magazine said it was great, if we didn't like it then it must be us because it couldn't be them. How presumptuous! It was still nasty and he didn't even adjust our bill. We paid over $100 and left hungry because we never got to eat. I will NEVER go there again."

One would be incorrect.\n\nReservations for the patio overlooking the pirate show were easy on a Thursday night and the crowd was a mixed bag of older rich guys with their wives and younger hipsters wearing True Religion.  Like everywhere else in Vegas, however, it isn't as much about how you look as how you spend.  \n\nSeating was prompt and the servers were quick......too quick, IMO, to suggest the most expensive menu items when my buddy asked for recs.  Admittedly, though, he was knowledgable of the menu and knew how to guide my non-sushi-loving friend to some safe choices.\n\nThroughout the course of the meal we selected and sampled the Tempura shrimp with cold udon and sweet sauce, Unagi Avocado Rolls, Kobe Tartare Roll, Jalapeno Hamachi Tartare, Cracklin Scallops with grilled eggplant, Chocolate Lava Cake, and Mochi.  Each dish was delicious and my friend raved the Kobe roll so much I actually ate beef for the first time in 7 years (what happens in Vegas, I guess.)  Particular standouts were the flawless Scallops and the Cherry Blossom Mochi.\n\nAfter the pirate show (from an AWESOME angle directly behind and w/o the crowd) we made our way out to the bar area, and although not particularly my 'scene' had a great time.  The waitress was friendly (not to mention gorgeous,) the drinks were pricey but tasty, especially the espresso Martini, and the crowd was fun.\n\nAll told, for a \"scenester\" sushi club, the place is nice and the fish is much fresher than most places of the like.  If you're looking for a place with a good view of the strip, some dinner time entertainment, a happening scene afterwards, and decent prices (expected Vegas Markup) for the food quality I'd say Social House might fit the bill."

She didn't really even welcome us which only lead to us sitting anywhere near the bar area and waiting for a few minutes before someone noticed that we were there to hand us over a menu and gives us a better welcome. I did notice she was on her phone while at the front as a hostess, not cool if you ask me. She also left a few minutes later so I am assuming she didn't really care being that it might have been the end of her shift. \n\nOk on to the better things about this place. Super cute and cozy, somewhat romantic atmosphere. Our waiter was nice and even helpful when we asked about the drinks. We also happened to show up during their happy hour. Their happy hour menu is pretty decent, 5pm -8pm every day INCLUDING WEEKENDS!!\n\nWe ordered their kokonattsu ($8) coconut flavor, semi strong drink and a Mothra Japanese Bellini ($9) sweet and refreshing, both drinks were easy to drink, enjoy and get a nice little buzz going. We decided to try their Angry Tuna Roll ($10) to share. The Angry Tuna Roll consisted of spicy tuna (duh!), avocado, a little jalapeno that wasn't spicy, and sweet amazu ponzu onion (which was super delicious). The roll is also deep fried. BOMB.COM!! I loved it! We were very tempted after the roll to order some more food such as their salmon tartare, kobe slidders and ramen.. Gosh,  that only means we totally have to go back!! Get a few drinks in, some tasty food and roam the Crystals shopping center. I wonder if I would have gotten a few more drinks in the husband, if I would have had any lucky coming out with a new purse or fancy shoes hahaha. Will definitely come back to Social House."

But we found out they had Ishiyaki on their menu, so that got my dad excited. Ishiyaki is a style of cooking where you cook meats, fish, veggies, etc. on hot stones. \n\nHowever, when the stone came out, it wasn't a stone, it was a ceramic-looking grill plate. So my dad asks suspiciously, \"Is that a stone?\" And the pretty boy waiter smiles and says \"yes,\" but in the way of \"yes, I don't really know anything so please don't ask me any more questions.\" It doesn't look like a stone, so my dad keeps asking. My mom and I wrangle my dad in so we can start eating (we're also there with other people and don't want to make a stink) and tell him \"it's ok, it's a stone\"...as we all look at the grill plate. I later found out on the internet that most ishiyaki nowadays is not done with natural stone but with a man-made stone composed of minerals that can keep the stone hot for a lengthy amount of time. Some of the stones actually look like real stones, but others look like the grill plate we saw. It would have been nice if the waiter could have explained that to us instead of just smiling and looking like he was lying to us (for all he knew, he was).\n\nFood:\n\nWe ordered a couple of meat & veggies and seafood & veggies plates to cook on the \"ishiyaki\", as well as miso soup and rice. Everyone thought the miso soup was pretty good. The rice, according to my mom the rice connoisseur, was not. Of the three dips that came with the Ishiyaki dishes we thought only the miso-based one was ok. The kobe beef that came out was good as were the other grilling foods. Since we did our own cooking, I can't say how the rest of the other menu items are.\n\nWe ordered the mochi ice cream for dessert. One order came with 3 unique flavors. I forget what they are but the lychii was the best one.\n\nService:\n\nService was slow, slightly snotty and only partially attentive. We asked for extra chopsticks after the grill items arrived to use them for cooking (it's a sanitary thing) but our waitstaff forgot about it (and were nowhere to be found) until we were almost done with dinner so everyone one just flipped their chopsticks back and forth for cooking vs. eating. Another thing is that they brought our dessert out as the Treasure Island show was starting. They encouraged us to get up and get closer to watch it, but our desserts were left on the table melting the whole time. It would have been nice if they took it back to the freezer while we were watching the show but they didn't.\n\nVerdict:\n\nWhile I think the people we were with might come back, I'm pretty sure my parents (fusion-haters) would not come back, especially since it wasn't the authentic ishiyaki they were imagining. As for me, I doubt I'd come back either. It's a little too hipsterish a place and I didn't like the vibe or the service enough to return. There's so many restaurants in Las Vegas, I would be more interested in trying a different one instead."

And they make a killer cup of coffee too (although the price will kill your wallet too... $15 YIKES).\n\nAll in all I think its a wonderful ambiance although kind of loud. Good food and their drinks looked good too!"

Odd location (although its inside Crystal Mall, a high end mall, it's still a mall). \n\nA group of us dined here for a bachelorette party.  Our server was extremely attentive, helpful, and very easy on the eyes lol.  As for the food we left 2 of the girls in the party to handle the ordering of the food.  Can't remember what exactly came out, but we had various rolls which were all good, but....the one dish that I remembered the most was the Toro Tartar.  On my own I normally wouldn't bother ordering any sort of tartar, but this was fantastically delicious: cool, creamy, with a bit of texture from the rice puffs(?) used as garnish. \n\nDinner was pricey but expected. I'd come back with the manfriend to try their happy hour in the bar area."

Apparently, the hot thing to do there is to let the waiters bring you food until you're full. Though the food they bring out is good, don't expect it to be cheap. When the bill arrived, I realized that the waiter had done double orders on some of our dishes, especially the expensive ones. Though the Kobe beef was excellent, we would have been sufficient with 6 pieces instead of the 12 that he brought on a single plate. Also, since we didn't order, all of our dishes came sashimi style. Though it accentuated the flavor of the dishes, I left the restaurant still a bit hungry while my wallet was already dry."

We decided to tell the waiter the types of flavors that we enjoyed and he then would bring us what he thought that we might enjoy.  He hit the nail on the head-out of everything we tried there was only one thing that was a little disappointing but that was only because the sauce on the beef roll was weird.  However, there was this beef Sashimi thing that we had that had a tempura jalapeo that was on top of it.  This was the biggest hit in our group, oh yea the scallop roll that we had was also a major hit.  There was this sauce that was on top it that was absolutely to die for.

            "review": "This review is for the ramen.\n\nLocated in the Aria Hotel, Social House is a popular destination for people looking to dine on sushi and ramen.  I've been a few times on various trips, always ordered the tonkotsu ramen w/ chashu, and had the same reaction each time. \n\nThe ramen always takes an unconscionably long time, for whatever reason.  It's always the last dish to be served and is not worth the wait.  At first glance, it's a pretty bowl of ramen topped with crispy minced garlic and spicy seasoning, but that's where the good news ends.  \n\nSocial House's ramen fails on all three of my ramen criteria: broth, noodles, egg. The broth is so thin and watered down and there's none of the distinctive pork flavor that characterizes most tonkotsu broths.  It's definitely bland on the ramen spectrum.  The noodles have been way overcooked on every single visit-- so soft and absolutely no chew.  They don't even seem to be alkaline noodles, but rather, noodles you'd find in a bowl of instant ramen.  Don't even get me started on the egg. Social House serves a POACHED egg, which is confusing at best.  It's nowhere near authentic and the egg retains an unappetizing gelatinous texture in the broth.  What is even happening here?\n\nI wouldn't recommend adding an order of chashu.  The cuts of pork belly are usually skimpy and not tender. Idk, the entire bowl is a strange excuse for tonkotsu ramen.  I think the only people who would enjoy it are those who have zero points of reference. \n\nOn a more positive note, the kobe sliders are pretty great.  The kobe beef is extremely tender and juicy and the hoisin-based sauce makes each bite deliciously sweet.  The buns are pillowy and just the right size. I love sweet+savory flavor combos and everything about the kobe sliders works for me! \n\nIf you don't really care/can't tell the difference, Social House provides a dark/sexy environment to enjoy some mediocre-ish Japanese food. But if you're looking for a great bowl of ramen, you won't find it here."

There was then some trouble and miscommunication with our dinner getting comped, but after everything was settled, we started our meal.  However, I would like to add that the management was very professional and nice at all times.  Usually other places would give you attitude and etc and would make you feel unwelcomed, but this place did no such thing.\n\nWe started off with edamame.  The edamame in chilli sauce was different!  But a good different!  Followed by the salad which was lightly dressed and decent, nothing too out of the normal.  The third dish were these beef tacos.  This was my ABSOLUTE favorite!  It wasn't a normal hard shell, and everything just came together nicely!  Great flavor and texture made it all that much better.  The sushi rolls were forgettable (california roll, tuna roll and salmon roll).  The dessert was pretty good.  The biscotti over the mango pudding was made perfectly and the mochi icecream (well let's just say I had better from a box).  \n\nI just LOVE this place and  will come back for sure next time I'm in Vegas!"

When we entered Crystals, which is a high-end shopping mall, I became very skeptical. \n\nBut I forget. This is Vegas; a place that can truly surprise you at every turn with it's ability to take the seemingly ordinary and make it extravagant. Social House's atmosphere was filled with the swanky lighting, decor, and music that you can find only in Sin City.  \n\nWe decided to go with the chef's menu. Meaning, the 6 of us dining spouted off things we didn't like (cucumber and salmon) and left the rest to the chef. Course after course came out with each one better than the next. The dishes were perfectly cooked (when applicable), dressed in the best of sauces, and presented beautifully. Yellowtail sashimi, kobe beef sliders, edamame (I know, it seems weak, but it was phenomenal), and a ginormous roll platter. There were several other dishes, but I can't even remember everything!

There was also a type of soy sauce put on the third portion of the trio, that is rare in most parts of the world, and was very tasty. \n\nNext was the toro (Blue Fin Tuna)! There were these little cracker balls in the sauce it was served with that made for great texture contrast.  An amazing dish.\n\nNext course was the largest seared sea scallops I've ever seen! Also, we had the striped sea bass, which was probably the climax of the entire meal. The Sous Chef ,Jake (who you may know from Bouchon???) prepared this so perfectly. \nAt this point I was full, but not finished. Jake brought out the ultimate roll and one other roll, that memory fails to recall. The ultimate roll was the goddiest roll ever.

Sous Chef Jake brought a custard type dessert that was very excellent and a bread pudding that I absolutely had to finish!\n\nEven though at the current moment the lightgroup has no accessible menu to view (get on it) do not hesitate to check this place out. One of my top 5 meals in Vegas w/o a doubt, maybe top 3."

BUT, there were misters all around the walls, and even though it was warm out it was WAY too much. Sort of wet and hard to see, even the waiter said he wanted to turn them off but couldn't. (was this a line?) The sushi was good, but I've had good sushi in other places, too. Not inexpensive but what is in Vegas? Oh, and the portions were much smaller than the average sushi bar. The scallop nigiri was good, the rolls were okay. \n\nMaybe if they had turned the misters off earlier in the evening we would have relaxed and enjoyed dinner more..."

We ended up going with a tasting and letting the waiter know what we absolutely didn't want (we had some mushroom haters) and our budget (80/person). Plate after plate of great food. We got to the point where we didn't end up eating any sushi because we were beyond full before then. With dessert and leaving stuffed, we were at (55/person). Not too shabby.\n\nThe only weird thing was that we ended up getting a big table outside the restaurant, in the mall. I thought it was cool but another person in our group joked that they \"had never been to such a fancy Panda Express.\" Did feel kinda food courty because we were sitting in a mall."

Ambiance is nice and I like the variety of soft seating near the front. \n\nOur waiter was excellent, despite having to leave 3-4 times to ask the kitchen questions. My dinner companion was pregnant so she wanted to be careful about what she ordered. \n\nI expected more from the lobster tempura special roll, especially for it being priced at $23-24. It was ok. The spicy tuna hand roll was good- the tuna was an actual chunk of fish with a spicy sauce instead of the mushed up spicy tuna I'm used to from my regular sushi places. The nori was oddly chewy- it was not very pleasant. I noticed it more on the tuna roll than the lobster, but the texture was off."

I have got to say, almost all the Vegas restaurants we visited had fantastic decor.\n\nThe menu is rather typical of a Japanese restaurant, sashimi, sushi, rolls, etc. Since this was our splurge meal of the trip, we opted for the Social House Omakase, at 95 USD per person. The Omakase consists of seven courses, chosen by the chef. The price is rather typical. You would expect a similar price point, give or take 20 dollars, to enjoy an Omakase in a Japanese restaurant in Toronto. Considering we are dining on the Las Vegas Strip, this is really not that bad.\n\nHere are the seven courses, all were good:\n\nFirst course: Yellowtail jalapeno\nSecond course: Albacore Garlic\nThird course: Tuna Special\nFourth course: Citrus Peel Miso Cod\nFifth course: Sea Bass\nSixth course: Five-piece sushi\nSeventh course: Strawberry sorbet\n\nI need to clarify something. We put in the special request of \"No red meat and no dairy\", which was probably the reason behind the two consecutive cooked fish courses (4th and 5th) and the sorbet for dessert. Hey, what else are a non-redmeat-eater supposed to eat, if not more fish? Certainly not their Spicy Ponzu Kobe Sashimi or their Hanger Steak with roasted shallot and Wasabi cream sauce! Sorry for teasing you with delicious sounding dishes.    :P \n\nPlease come and visit my blog, where I have pictures of every course and more ;)\nThanks in advance.\n\nhttp://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/08/social-house-crystals-las-vegas.html"

But it's REALLY GOOD sushi. Oh wait, I did only pay $3 for a Coors Lite during their happy hour!!!\n\nSocial House makes up for \"Vegas prices\" by offering the friendliest staff I've experienced in a long time. And the atmosphere is cool. We sat at the bar to watch the playoffs and the staff was really on point, despite taking care of other tables. Hot hostesses, no wait, tasty fish, cheap happy HR, and great service. Really good stuff other than sushi too.. Best sushi place so far in Vegas in my opinion."

I go to Social House at least twice a week because I love it so much :) and I am no wealthy person so the prices are affordable especially for what your getting! The manager Charlie is the nicest manager I have ever met in a restaurant and so welcoming. She took time to talk to me about the gluten free desserts and what she likes, it is a lot of the reason I like to come because she is a over the top manager! All of the bartenders are AWESOME too and so patient and kind! I order unusual orders and they always make me feel as if it's not complicated at all!

We got seated at a small table by the corner and the tabke right next to us is literally inches away from us. This is one thing I dont really like about this restaurant being seated too close to each other. Other decors inside the restaurant is great. I like the ceiling lighting a lot. It feels like old school janpanese hourses. \n\nFor appetizer, we ordred salmon wasabi which took quite some time to come. It is 7 thin pieces of salmon with crispy shallot and wasabi cream on top. It is a cold plate yet so wonderful. We also ordered spicy tuna to share. Personally I dont think too highly of it. It is good just there is nothing really special about it. \n\nFor main course, we ordered chili seared scallops and hanger steaks. It comes with three large scallops in special sauce. One thing I m very impressed is that the chefs use sliced chinese dry sausages. It gives more flavor to the dish and match perfectly with the freshness of the scallops. The hanger steak is a good dish too, very flavorful and our medium rare is prepared just the way we like it."

When perusing their food menu I noticed they had crispy pata. Crispy pata is an old school filipino dish. It's a deep fried pork knuckle served with soy sauce for dipping. Don't knock it until you try it ! It was staple at our house when my dad and uncles would all drink together. Total comfort food for me. Crispy pata is also known for being hella cheap too.  My wife and I ordered the crispy pata which was cooked perfectly and tasted bomb. The skin was crispy and pork was juicy and not too greasy. It was as good as the hole in the wall filipino places in LA , but damn $28 though? My lola is probably turning over in her grave if she knew how much we paid for that damn savory, juicy, deep fried pork knuckle goodness. Sorry lola! =(\n\n\nThe decor, ambiance and service at Social House is great. Although, the decor did remind me of a more upscale version of PF changs. Not hating. Just keepin it real. Plus I love PF Changs.\n\n3.55 stars, rounding up to 4."

I called up and made reservations for an early dinner at 5pm in the lounge.  I didn't know if we had to order from the happy hour menu and the hostess tells us- nope, you can order from both if you want.  Terrific!!\n\nWe get there and Robert sees us and greets us- how nice to remember us from last time! \n\nWe get seated and we order:\n\n1. Japanese Bellini (from the happy hour menu)\n*YUM!  White peach puree.  A tad different than the original Bellini, but definitely something I really enjoyed and would order again.\n\n2. Salmon Avocado Cut Roll (from the happy hour menu)\n*It was good last time so we decided to get it again!  Fresh and has great flavor!\n\nWe didn't get a chance to meet Michael last time we were in, and Rob brought him over and introduced us.  Both are very nice gentlemen!  They asked if they could try out a new drink they are working on.  Us turn down alcohol?!  NEVER!\n\nIt was a splash of cranberry, lemongrass and ginger cocktail.  It was very light tasting and something that you would totally expect a Japanese restaurant to have.  My mom sucked down the entire thing- she's a fan! :)\n\nWe then decided to go for the gusto and ordered:\n\n3. Social House Ultimate Roll (from the regular dinner menu-$40)\nKing Crab, Seared Kobe Beef Tenderloin, Lobster, Seared Scallop, Spicy Tuna, Avocado, Cucumber, White Truffle Oil\n*OMG!  This roll is fabulous!  It had gold leaf on the top!  It was one of the prettiest sushi rolls I have seen in a long time.  All of the flavors come together in this delicious roll and the crunch of the cucumber in the middle is seriously perfect.  Definitely worth the $40 and it fills you up!\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone and everyone that wants sushi.  I can't wait to go back again!"

            "review": "Social House is part of TI's continuing makeover. It offers a modern take on Japanese food, as well as the obligatory sushi bar. However, Social House is a little more than that. Operated by the same people that run Pure at Caesars Palace, it's designed to be half restaurant and half lounge. At night, the dining tables convert into cocktail tables.\n\nSocial House's chef left Nobu to work here. The overall feel of the menu reflects his Nobu roots, but with some new twists. Choices include Kobe taro chips with peanut sauce, coconut lemon grass soup, citrus peel miso cod, soy mirin kurobuta pork belly, and tamarind short ribs. The sushi bar serves up the usual suspects.\n\nThe feel of the place varies according to where you sit, and when you go. There's a sushi bar, a couple of other bars, indoor seating, and outdoor seating. Late at night, the place turns into a hybrid restaurant/lounge; the high tech tables adjust to become smaller and more lounge like.\n\nDuring early evening hours, Social House feels mostly like a restaurant. I ate in the lounge. It has dark wood floors and dark wood tables. The lighting level is low, provided mostly by small lights hanging in dozens of wooden bird cages suspended from the ceiling. Moderately loud Latin American music, with a heavy beat, is playing. The lounge partly faces the Strip - and TI's pirate show. An interesting twist!\n\nSesame Kelp Salad was a pretty good version of a standard dish. The green seaweed was tender yet crunchy, with sesame seeds and enough sesame oil to give it flavor. It was a very large portion, and would have been a good candidate for sharing.\n\nI followed that up with Orange Peel Miso Cod, plus a bowl of steamed rice. Not so long ago, this would have been deemed exotic; nowadays, it's pretty common. However, that's not to say it wasn't good. Indeed, the fish was soft yet flaky, cooked just right. The sweet-but-not-too-sweet glaze was nicely flavored.\n\nSocial House prides itself on its sake selection. I'm not a sake expert, but it's fun to try different types. This is a good place to experiment. The sake was served in a very attractive bamboo carafe, with matching bamboo cup; a nice touch.\n\n\n\nI'm having some trouble providing an evaluation because I had just one simple meal, and I wasn't around late enough in the evening to see what the place was like as a night spot. As a spot for a light early dinner, I'd say it's pretty good, with reasonable prices."

We ended trying a little of everything from their selected menues (cold, hot, meats, sushi, dessert etc). It was nice, because the dishes were just the right portion for my girlfriend and I to share and not fill up on one course, leaving us room to try the other goodies. Some in particular we loved were the citrus miso cod, yellowtail jalepeno and the kobe slices seared in garlic oil!  At dessert,  we ended up trying their yummy mochi and had siphon coffee.  I'll say straight up, this was one of the best cups of coffee ive ever had.  The machine they brew it on looks like some sort of crazy chemistry set. \n\nOverall, I couldn't have been happier. The service was great; the vibe was sheek, and the food was amazing.  Prices were moderate, so next time we come back, it'll probably be a special occasion or something."

I made the request to sit somewhere else and they put us in a private booth, which was cool.   \n\nThis place is such a rip-off and totally overrated! Do not recommend coming here."

Having a child in tow didn't stop us from venturing into fine dining for the evening.\n\nOur meal started with shrimp & pork lumpia served with sweet chili sauce, the flavors reminiscent to Filipino style home-made lumpia rolls with a heavier price tag. There's no set guidelines to good lumpia making it rather subjective from household to household. In short, it was good lumpia.\n\nThe second dish: Hokkaido Sea Scallops came out salty! Thoroughly disappointed. The texture of scallops was spot on but failed in execution, good grief whoever worked our plate needs to lay off the salt.\n\nThe final plate before we eventually got fed up, the Striped Sea Bass, was tender, not flaky nor overdone, was accompanied by a similar steamed fish sauce prominent in Chinese style preparations (specifically Guangzhou if memory serves me correct). Moreover upon pondering on the closest approximation to its flavor; it would be my sister's Mother-in-Law's fish sauce...(which is absolutely divine & perfected through generations). A recipe I've coveted for a long time now.\n\nThese revelations really bummed us out, when we came to the realization that all that we consumed for the night were mediocre version of comfort food that we were raised on and easily accessible if we just had dinner at home like the rest of the family...\n\nThis is a FML moment."

We tried 8 different items on the happy hour menu. My faves were the seaweed salad and angry tuna roll. Bronzed broccoli was perfectly cooked.

It was nice I was able to share this place with good friends, but there were some misses this time around: \n\n- We were seated at the outside patio. And while the weather was nice and the view of the Palazzo & Wynn/Encore towering over you left you in awe, the stupid 'Sirens of TI' pirate show will happen every hour and a half. And this is the revised pirate show with the slutty pirate ladies and unecessary dancing on the ship. Don't forget about the explosions and fireworks. I can't believe how many people still stop to watch this.\n\nThe show lasts about 20 minutes. It's really loud so conversation with your party will cease and everybody will be focused on the show. It's a good thing food for 9 people came out quick so we avoided the encore.\n\n- Don't get the Sapporo fish and chips. You can find that at the hotel food court. And while the chips are like those Asian shrimp chips you fry up, I wanted fries haha. Should've got the Kobe beef sliders. \n\nMake sure you confirm where you'll be seated at especially for large parties."

The vibe is cool, the bar isn't too loud, and the food was good.  The table was disgusting, our glasses and plates were so stuck to the table we had to literally force them off the surface because they were stuck.  Have these guys heard of windex or other cleaners?  Our server was good for the first 30 minutes then disappeared.  30 minutes later, I motioned to the bartender for the check, he saw me, walked over to the table next to us to help them, ignored us, and walked back to the bar while he was spinning the vinyl credit card/check holder like a basketball on his finger.  Nice trick but douchy.  Liked the happy hour, cool place, but won't go back anytime soon."

Four of us headed out on a Friday night to get some sushi and decided to stop here. We never had the chance to check out Social House when it was located at Treasure Island, but were glad it was able to open elsewhere because the food was amazing.\n\nThere wasn't a bad dish among the ones we tried. Some of the standouts include the yellowtail with crispy jalape\u00f1o, salmon with wasabi creme fraiche, citrus peel miso cod on bibb lettuce cups, the tamarind short ribs, and the seared albacore with spicy tuna, shrimp tempura and avocado specialty roll. If you go, I would highly recommend any or all of those.\n\nIf you're turned off by modern/fusion Japanese cuisine this isn't the place for you. While they do offer traditional nigiri and sashimi, the menu is filled with items and ingredients that have an Indian, Filipino, and southeast Asian spin to them. The executive chef, Joe Elevado, is a former Nobu chef so you can expect that same Nobu level of creativity and execution.\n\nThe location isn't the best -- inside Crystals where there's very little foot traffic. There's no need to make reservations before 8 or 9 because the place was dead. When we got there at 6:30 there was only one or two other tables that were occupied. The interior is long and narrow with a modern and sleek Japanese feel. There are several intimate and cool spots to eat, like the row of booths running down the center of the room that provides a spot to see and be seen (if there were more patrons).\n\nAs with all places on the Strip, expect to pay a premium. Social House may not be outrageously expensive, but it isn't cheap. We spent about $95 a person for 10 dishes, wine, beer, tax and tip."

We wanted to sit outside and this is one of the few sushi places with outdoor seating.  The atmosphere of this place is incredible.  It's very chic, modern, hip, and plays great music.  The outdoor patio overlooking the strip and Venetian (and pirate show) is spectacular.  Social House probably serves THE best spicy tuna rolls I have ever had.  The toasted sesame seeds inside the rolls were a nice touch and the tuna was uber fresh.  The salmon and cream cheese roll was dee-lish as well.  We tried the adobo chicken roll (one of their house rolls) and sent it back.  I guess warm chicken threw us off and we didn't like the taste of it.  In fact, it was weird.  Prices were reasonable and they had a great wine list.  We will definitely go back the next time we are in Vegas.\n\nAs for the service, it was good.  We liked how the waitstaff cleared our 'used' edamame plate frequently and filled our water glasses nonstop.  Our waiter did forget one of our items but hey, everyone forgets things once in a while.  \n\nWe splurged and ordered the chocolate cake for dessert.  With the chocolate cake came Kona coffee ice cream.  It was sinful.  It was seriously THE most delicious ice cream we have ever tasted.  \n\nNow for something really cool:  If you want to make a reservation you can go to their web site, fill out a reservation request form and someone will literally call you within 2 minutes.  That was awesome!"

Unfortunately, I think this tends to be the trend - good for me, bad for them.\n\nThe staff manning the bar and lounge area were nice and friendly enough, as were my closest neighbors along the bar.  Their aptly named Social Hour Menu is offered from 5pm-8pm daily.  It isn't large, and was pretty much meat-centric, but had a decent variety.\n\nI considered my appetite and decided to go with:\n\n.Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups $10 citrus peel miso cod, bibb lettuce cups, 2 pieces\n\n.Ramen Noodles $8 choice of Tonkotsu or Miso, pork belly add on $2\n\nThe cod lettuce cups were pretty tiny in size but completely the opposite on taste.  The miso cod had a richness that reminded me of Chilean sea bass; my favorite (yet sadly endangered) fish.\n\nThe ramen was a bit forgetful.  But then I did just so happen to have enjoyed  Santouka's ramen with its spoon-worthy broth and tender pork but two weeks prior.  Admittedly, not quite a fair fight.  But as a filler, it did well enough.  I could have made a nice light meal of 5 pieces of the cod cups, but I doubt they'd have sold me a half order, and at $25, it would a bit heavy on the wallet.\n\nAnywho, if you are in the area, I do recommend hitting this place up for their Happy Hour."

I also told the hostess that it was my friends birthday, expecting the restaurant to do the whole bday thing for him. They brought over some mochi ice cream (which was pretty good), but charged us for it!

While some may have visited that location due to being able to see the TI Pirate Show -- that was never my reason.  The food, the drinks, and the setup (including that amazing balcony/patio) made Social House THE must-visit place, despite its location inside the otherwise useless Treasure Island Hotel.\n\nBut then they closed.  (Bad!)\nThen I was told they are reopening somewhere else. (Good!)\n\nWell, on this last visit to Vegas, I had told Mr. K that I'd like to visit the new location, and together with a couple of friends, we visited Social House, now located inside the TRULY IMPRESSIVE Crystals City Center (which wasn't even there on my last visit to Sin City).  \n\nWalking in, I noted that they carried over the same modern/hip theme.  The bar/lounge area was just as nice, and very similar in feel.  We took seats at the bar and ordered some appetizers and drinks off of their happy hour menu.  One friend had the sliders, which I didn't try, but I ordered the tempura-like shrimp, which was quite tasty. \n\nThe general manager was kind enough to give us a whole tour of the restaurant, and it was -ALMOST- as nice as the old location.  OK - I'm lying; it was really nice but not really as nice as the old location, where the two floors simply knocked my socks off.  Similar to their old location, they did include a patio dining area, but it's not really a patio when you're just overlooking the rest of the fantastic Crystals City Center (indoors). \n\nBecause we had a fancy dinner planned for that evening, we couldn't sit down and actually have a meal at Social House, which was always SH's selling point in the old location.  But the GM did invite us back to try their \"amazing coffee\", so we promised that we'd be back after dinner for dessert.\n\nDespite having had dessert after an amazing dinner - we promised, and we delivered by running back to Social House for their coffee.  I believe the coffee was $14 (gasp?) but Mr K and I took a seat at the lounge and waited patiently through the brewing process (which was rather fascinating).  A long time ago, I had come to Social House to have their \"dough balls\" which still remain in my mind as one of the best desserts ever.  I was thrilled to find that it was still on the menu, so of course, I had to beg that we have \"one more dessert\"!  I did note that it was now called \"Lychee Dough Balls\"; that should have been my first hint.\n\nThe coffee was spectacular, as promised.  After dinner at SH, you must try their coffee.\nTheir dough balls???  WHAT WAS THAT?\nI had one and could touch no more, but it was dough balls filled with a lychee gel or concoction of some sort -  and it would ooze on the first bite.  While I am a big fan of anything that oozes - - this was just a bad, bad combination.\n\nBring back the old dough balls!  Why mess with perfection???  It used to go perfectly with the coffee!\n\nIn the end, I don't feel like it's equal to the old Social House for several reasons, and have to dock it a star.  But Social House is STILL one of the hippest joints in Las Vegas, and for excellent Japanese fusion, you MUST try this place!"

It was dripping in the ginger dressing. It was tasty, but I wasn't interested in drinking my salad.\n\n+Second course: Tonkotsu ramen, pork broth, a slab of pork, served with a soft-boiled egg and some fried garlic bits. The broth tasted kinda funny, so we added a splash of soy sauce for some flavor, broke open the yolk to add some creaminess, and sprinkled in the fried bits of garlic for some bite. It helped tremendously. I finished the entire bowl. Woo, proud member of the Clean Plate Club!\n\n+Third course: spicy tuna cut roll. Here's where the problem lies: I don't know about you, but I cannot stand it when sushi has creamy ingredients added to it. Save the mayonnaise for sandwiches and the cream cheese for bagels. When I order sushi, I want simplicity; the flavors of the rice, nori, and fish must be able to stand alone, otherwise, I begin to wonder what you're trying to hide with that huge dollop of aioli.

But thanks to Social House's happy hour that landed on my typical dinner hour, I highly recommend this place! If you're here during the happy hour (5-8pm?) get the edamame, ramen, salmon sushi roll, and wine/blue moon. Don't even bother looking at the dinner menu. I tried the toro sashimi ($25/4 pieces), not worth it. I had better toro. As for seared albacore - nothing special about it.\n\nExceptional service - 5 stars!\n\nSocial House, I shall be back!"

We even tacked on some extra food after we made our primary order just to try some other things because we were having such a great time.\n\nIt was my friend's birthday and they came out with a special HUGE dessert for her that we all shared.

Couldn't the entree at least come with a bowl of rice?  The cost would be maybe 50 cents?\n\nDessert - The mochi was SMALL (make a circle with one hand and that's how big it was), but the lychee flavor was good.  My husband ordered the sorbet, and unfortunately the chef's choice of the day was cucumber sorbet.  Have you ever had Korean pickled cucumber?  It tasted like that in sorbet form.

A three-course meal for that price at a Strip restaurant is a bargain, so we welcomed the idea of making Social House our Plan B for lunch.\n\nFOOD\nAs I had mentioned, it's $20 for the prix-fixe menu, but I did notice that certain ramen bowls that are part of the menu cost an additional $5 or $10. \n\nCourse 1: Miso soup. Lots of broth and few cubes of tofu. Soup had that savory miso taste, but there was an odd flavor twist that I couldn't pinpoint. \n\nCourse 2: Vegetable Tempura Bowl. There were seven or so pieces of tempura battered and fried vegetables with a small serving of rice to cushion the bottom of the bowl. Fried tempura anything (well..almost anything) is usually good, but the large piece of broccoli that I ate was bitter. \n\nCourse 3: Shrimp Tempura Roll. Another decent-tasting order, but the pieces were significantly smaller in size to other shrimp tempura rolls I've eaten elsewhere.\n\nSERVICE\nThe service is the primary reason why I've chosen to give Social House 2-Stars. Quick note: The place wasn't busy during lunchtime (12:30 p.m.).\n\nIt took approximately five minutes for our server to arrive to take my friend's drink order. As for my order, he left before I could say anything.\n\nWe requested glasses of ice water; the server returned with a pitcher of water without ice cubes.\n\nTook 10 minutes (too long) for him to return to take our orders. \n\nI wasn't sure what the Locomoco was, but our server gave me the following detailed description: Rice with some hamburger on the side. No special seasonings or sauces? Apparently, no. \n\nOTHER\nThere aren't any descriptions of the food on the prix-fixe menu.\n\nOVERALL\nWeak service and average food. Be social elsewhere."

This rating is for their \"Social Hour,\" which is their happy hour from 5-8. \n\nI'm a huge noodle soup fan, in fact it's one of my favorite foods, and strangely enough, Ramen is not in that group. I've never had a Ramen soup I've really liked, and this includes the famous and much hyped Momofuku Noodle bar in NYC. I've tried Ramen everywhere, and just about gave up when I thought the Ramen at Momofuku blew.  Alas, the \"social\" hour at Social House had great prices and I read great things about their Ramen. So I thought, what do I have to lose, it was a very reasonable price and many others said it was very good. So I went with the pork belly and poached egg, and damn it was the best Ramen I've ever had! It wasn't bland like most Ramen soups, it was very flavorful, and the pork belly was seared just right and had a good amount of meat (unlike most Ramen noodles). The poached egg was also perfectly cooked. While most Ramen is bland, this one had a delicate balance of flavor, meat, noodles, and broth, what supposedly Ramen should be. The harmony created one hell of a noodle soup dish. \n\nEverything else I got was also good, the kobe sliders were good (came with fries too!), angry tuna roll was good, the salmon avocado rolls were good, there was really only one meh item and that was the Kalbi rolls. Everything else was delicious. The reason why I was able to try all of those dishes was because of the happy hour prices, it was very reasonable. I expected it to be little portions, but they were actually big portions and I shared them with my brother. \n\nAnother big plus were the bartenders, big ups to them, they were some of the coolest and friendliest bartenders I have ever met. They were very friendly and talkative, the type that made you feel good on your vacation/trip. Thanks to them for making the experience at Social House even better. I rarely ever, EVER, eat at the same place on two consecutive days, especially on a trip. This place I had to just because of the great food, great prices, and very friendly bartenders. I even recruited some others to go. That's just how great this place is. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this place on The Strip, in Crystal Malls no less, since everything there was very expensive. Even the drinks were at a great price, it was $3 for a blue moon. You can't go wrong at this place, it nails everything you want when you go out to eat which is really rare: great food, great prices, and friendly service."

I know its a small club but everyone was friendly and you could actually move on the dance floor.\n\nGreat way to start an evening out."

Mind you it was my best friends birthday, who is japanese, and it was a friends and family dinner. The waiter passed out the menu and then gave us a 30min lecture on the menu. I was way more confused about the menu after the lecture than I was before he blabbed on about the menu itemsI Also he kept of saying Social House is very non traditional and that all the traditional stuff on the menu is boring and not to order it. Dude half of the people at this table is Japanese and they pretty much took offense to that. In their defense I would have taken offense to it as well if I were Japanese.  Also he was talking to us as if we were trying Japanese food for the first time. He was trying to explain to us that edamame was soybeans. SERIOUSLY!! HE was a very annoying waiter if you can't tell. Totally had to dock a star for that.\n\nOn to a brighter note. The food was delicious. We ordered edamame, yellowtail sashimi, tuna sashini, soft shell crab, popcorn shrimp, kobe tacos, lettuce cups, rolls and the scallops. \n\nSashimi:\nBoth of the sashimis were delicious. I would highly recommend both the yellowtail and the tuna. However I liked the TUNA ALOT!!!!!! The different sauces and flavors were just amazing. I would definitely go back to eat the tuna again. \n\nPopcorn shrimp:\nBOMB!!! Came with these amazing suaces. There was one that was really spciy and delicious. I would highly recommend this as well. \n\nLettuce cups:\nSO GOOD!! A bib lettuce with a piece of miso cod. Filled with so much flavor and deliciousness.\n\nI would highly recommend the three dished above. \n\nThe atmosphere is very trendy. I felt like I was in a Giesha House but in Las Vegas, but with better food. It is definitely worth trying out.\n\ngood eats :)"

The ambiance is really cool and the staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, especially with recommendations.  We went on a Thursday night so it wasn't all that crowded and the food came out relatively quick.  Here's what we ordered:\n\nSesame Kelp Salad - Good, but nothing special.  Not that different from seaweed salads elsewhere.  \n\nYellowtail Sashimi - This was by far the best dish we had that night.  Flavorful and delicate with a nice citrus/soy kick.  The fish was the perfect temperature and it all just melded together brilliantly.\n\nSeared Albacore Roll - Very good as well.  Great blend of flavors but similar to other really good rolls out there.  \n\nSoft Shell Crab Roll - I really liked this one because of the extra crunchiness of the crab.  Maybe they overcooked it slightly because there was also a smokey flavor to the crab, which was really nice.  The contrast of textures really played well together.\n\nOrder of Tuna Nigiri - Quality tuna and very tasty.\n\nOrder of Shrimp Nigiri - Pretty standard but still good.\n\nNot too much food but still really satisfying meal.  I would've given the place 3 stars but the yellowtail sashimi and killer ambiance pushed up to 4.  Definitely a great date place if you have extra cash to burn because it's not cheap, but well worth the experience!"

I like that they know their menus inside and out, can ask the right questions to the guests, and make really good recommendations.  They came across as very patient and understanding.  Even the chef!\n\nI only hung out at the bar/lounge area which came across as an old school yet modern asian inspired lounge.  Of course there's bar seating but there's also a few tables in the lounge area to serve small groups.  If you wanted to, you can order from the full menu here as well....not just from the bar menu. \n\nHighly recommend the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno.   Well balanced flavors from the ginger and jalapeno.  The texture and overall kick was tasty.\n\nBartenders were very attentive to my needs, making sure my glass was never empty.  In fact when they poured my beer from the bottle to a glass, they left the bottle with its remaining beer next to the glass.  Okay yeah not weird....but the cool part was every time they did that, the bartenders consistently made sure the bottle was turned so that the label was facing me.  Yeah at first I thought it was coincidence but then I realized each bar staff did that consistently.  Yes I drank that much to make sure it was consistent each and every time.  Ahh the simple things and details that make me happy!\n\nKevyn and Jonas:  Thanks for the recommendation on Herbs and Rye Cocktail Lounge to checkout.   That was definitely the spot I had in mind!  You were right with recommending Vieux Carre and Blood and Sand!\n\nSide Notes:\n\n-They were playing old school Jackie Chan movies on the TV screens in the lounge!  Cool.\n\n-This place can get a bit pricey, but hey it's on the Strip.....is that really a surprise?   It shouldn't be.\n\n-Its all about the quality of the food....not the quantity....there is plenty of variety on the menu!\n\n-They got Crispy Pata on the menu!  mm mmm good"

Found this place as we were walking in the Crystal Shopping Center and noticed the lunch prix fixe menu. $20 for 3 courses.  In Vegas standards, it was a good deal.  \nThe atmosphere is hip and trendy Asian, but the back room has a comfy feel for lunch.  The service was better than I had anticipated.  Professional, friendly, and right on top of things before and after requests.\n\nWe started with an order of edamame.  It was original on one side and spicy on the other.  Tasted good, but pricey for the order we received (somewhere between $4-5).  For the 3 course lunch, we ordered salad, some standard rolls, and ramen (paying $5 extra for the tonkotsu ramen was not worth it).  All in all, the food was just ok.  Not bad, but not great.  It did satisfy the craving, however, this is not a place I would crave to go back to."

The cocktails (prices can be as high as the Demon Slayer at $31.00) and beer selection was out of this world.  Tried several selections and it ended up costing as much as dinner (gasp).  Also had a Japanese beer (Gingakogen) which came in a beautiful blue bottle, could have drank several of those, but at $18/bottle I settled on one.\n\nEnjoyed the Kobe Sliders at $24.00 and they were fantastic.  Loved the fresh sashimi featured in the tasting menu.\n\nThis place is definitely a splurge, but hey.... life is worth it!  The service and attention to every detail was really a nice experience.

Even though \"family style\" may remind you of Bucca Di Beppo, I assure you this is nothing like that!  \n\nLet's break it down for you... order a plethora of items and dig in! I love when you can trust a server to pick out the best items and just let them go for it!  We just told them a price point per person we wanted to stick with and off he went.  Honestly, for $60 per person, we ended up with A LOT of food.  I was a little nervous, considering Japanese can get pricey, but by the end of the meal I could hardly finish the last dish (although I did:)\n\nI think the marinade for each sashimi we got made each one, topped with the extremely fresh fish made those the stand outs of the evening for me. I thought they were all killer and would recommend any of these:\n\nYellowtail Jalapeno - garlic, cilantro, calamansi Soy with a fried jalapeno to top\nSalmon Wasabi - wasabi cr\u00e8me, lemon Soy, crispy shallot, chives\nFluke Soy Salt - chili Oil, soy salt, citrus\nKobe Sashimi - a play on thinly sliced kobe beef, yumm-o!\n\nWe also ordered the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups. I thought the contrast between the cool lettuce and fried cod was really good.  I know this wasn't a favorite of the table, but I really enjoyed it!\n\nOur last course was the sushi. The angry tuna roll was pretty amazing. I mean, deep fried sushi roll? Who wouldn't love it! The seared albacore was good and so was the yellowtail, but angry tuna, the star of the show, for sushi at least. \n\nI would definitely recommend making a reservation before you get to Vegas, but one thing I will note is that we came in around 7pm and the place was dead, so you may be able to squeeze in last minute.  Ambiance is classy yet hip, so wear your hot cocktail dresses ladies and for dudes... something other than jeans and sneakers will do!"

Well, also the great reviews on Yelp help too. :)\n\nI reserve on Opentable.com for 6pm Saturday. My boyfriend and I arrived 5 minutes earlier and were told to sit in the lounge for our table to be ready but we didn't wait long. As soon as our Hostess lead us upstairs I knew i was going to LOVE Social House. Its fun, hip and chic, Social House Restaurant has a live DJ and interactive sushi bar (kinda reminds me of Blow Fish BUT better). Its fashionable yet relaxed atmosphere ideal for big group or a romantic couple dinner.\n\nOur waiters were very attentive and friendly. I didn't know what to order and our waiter was happy to suggest his favorite dishes. So we finally decided on 1 Cold Dish (Mixed Nigiri Sushi $32), 1 Hot Dish (5 Spice Chicken Wings ($10), 2 Social House Rolls (Adobo Chicken and Caramelized Onions with Soy Vinegar Chicken Reduction $12) & Shrimp and Spicy Tuna Battera (box) Roll $20). I have to say the food was excellent especially the Shrimp and Spicy Tuna Battera. It was TOO die for. $20 for a 6 pieces sushi was worth the price. The roll was a square shaped rather than the normal round roll. The mixed Nigiri plate were fresh. Our whole meal cost about $118 with non-alcoholic drinks. Many people might think the sushi is over price but I thought the prices match the fresh quality, flavor & presentation. You wont find the typical mainstream sushi rolls. \n\nOur waiters kept coming back to see how we were doing and also refilling our drinks without me requesting for a refill (that's a BIG plus). The next time, i am in town i will definitely eat at Social House again. \n\nThank you Social House for making my Vegas trip memorable! :)"

I know, I know -- it's either Vegas or New Orleans, but hey! both cities know how to drink!  Anyway, after several nights of excellent but \"fancy\" food, we were thinking something light and Japanese came to mind.  The problem is, we're staying at the Death Ray -- sorry, the Vdara -- and there are no restaurants per se in the hotel, and the Japanese restaurants nearby in the Bellagio or the Aria don't open until dinner.  BUT . . . there is this place called \"Social Hall\" that opens at 1:00 pm on Friday, so --\n\nNow 1:00 in the afternoon is a DIFFERENT CLIENTELE than a nightclub/bar/restaurant into the evening . . . all we really wanted was some lunch.  So readers would be well advised to a) take this review with a grain of salt, and b) understand it is a review of this establishment for LUNCH, in contrast to the overwhelming number of other reviews in which more sensible Yelpers than I went during the evening hours.\n\nNo complaints about the food.  It wasn't a \"Wow!\" but we sort of weren't expecting it to be.  The kitchen was out of some things -- I guess they weren't expecting people to eat lunch (but then why open for lunch?), as we were repeated told that a particular dish \"isn't ready yet.  It will be ready for dinner.\"  Uh, OK, but why open of lunch?  The Bento box was fine; the sushi was good.  But overall it seemed to lack that certain *spark* that elevates it above the ordinary.  \n\nThe waitress was simply not interested in us or in our needs.  Water glasses went unfilled.  She never asked us if we wanted to order more sake.  And it took forever to get the check.\n\nAnd the pulsating techno music at 1:00 in the afternoon gets tiresome by about 1:10.\n\nHOWEVER . . . in a move that is VERY unusual for Las Vegas, someone in this place truly cares about coffee!  They have a beautiful Hario siphon setup, complete with halogen heaters, plus a La Marzocco 3-group Linea and three Mazzer grinders for espresso.  The Ethipoian Harrar siphon coffee we enjoyed was superb!  Bonus points for that alone!  \n\nIf I were here for dinner, or if I were clubbing, well, I can certainly understand this place getting 4+ stars in reviews.

That was the extent of her concern. \n\nShe never came back to bring napkins for my friend to wipe herself nor the puddle on the table next to her.

The host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet.  My girl friend and I each had a a cocktail while we waited.  Wow! I loved their \"Socialite\" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their \"lycheetini\".  Both drinks were incredible!! This definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have. \n\nWhen it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called \"hana awaka\"....it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we've ever had.  It was a little pricey (then again, what's not pricey in Vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new! \n\nThe food, oh the food was just so incredible.  My favorites were hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups, and uni.  All of the dishes have nice portion since it's meant to be shared, which I thought was a great concept!  The food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  My girl friend and I were definitely in sushi heaven.  \n\nEveryone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.  The manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time.  My water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as I drank some.  For someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so I'm constantly asking for more water, this is a huge plus for me.   \n\nThe ambiance was amazing.  We enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn't hear our own conversation. \n\nOverall, we had an incredible experience dining at social house.  It was such a fantastic meal my girl friend and I were still talking about it half an house after we walked out of the restaurant!  This is definitely one place we have to visit every time we go to Vegas!"

I don't remember seeing anything extraordinary on the menu but everything I've ever tried here, from the rolls, to kobe sliders to the chocolate balls in a bag (dessert) were all at least pretty good. Some were great.\n\nThe service has been kind of spotty.

The decor is modern and trendy, as is to be expected of a place trying to market itself to the young and beautiful. The main room looks a little bit crowded and is very loud, but sitting in one of the smaller side rooms is pleasant and comfortable.\nThe chef worked at Nobu for years, and while his sushi is just slightly above average (nothing bad, but also nothing to write home about), the sake selection and appetizers were by and large very tasty and interesting.\n\nWe sampled a wide variety of appetizers, and the garlic-oil seared fluke, whitefish seviche and scallop and giant clam dynamite were truly delicious. Well balanced flavors, first-grade ingredients and great preparation. The salads were fresh and tasty, but nothing new or awe-inspiring. A noodle dish arrived completely overcooked - not only far away from al dente (as it was described by the server), but complete mush.\n\nThe service is laid back and casual, maybe a bit too casual at times. While every staff member we met was very friendly and enthusiastic about their food, they definitely seemed to have been hired more for their looks than professional experience. Be prepared to meet some handsome, charming, food-loving kids who sometimes fly a bit by the seat of their pants.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable place, but I am giving it only three stars because of the botched dish, the varying quality/creativity of the food and the slight lack of professionalism in the service. For the price, you ought to be able to expect more."

As the happy hour is only available in the bar lounge area, we were seated at a table next to the shuttered windows looking outside (to the mall walkway). \n\nThe happy hour menu consists of cold items, warm items, rolls and beverages. \nI ordered the most expensive happy hour drink... $9 for a sparkling sake Bellini, and it was yum. So easy to drink, I could have easily had 3 of them. \n\nFor food, we had: \n\nRamen with poached egg and pork belly - O.M.G. This is a hidden gem for ramen. The Tonkotsu broth was creamy and rich (thinking about it makes my mouth water). With the poached egg, the broth became even more buttery. Amazing. \nThere were 2 slices pork belly I thought there was a good mixture of fat and meat, but it was perfected with the seared outer layer. You can tell it's a good sear when it's still firm after sitting in broth for a couple minutes. Some of the noodles were stuck together but at least they were all cooked and not al dente. \n\nSalmon tartare with Taro chips - I didn't get a picture of this because it was our first dish and I was bordering hangry, so I devoured it. The taro chips were house made and fresh. The salmon tartare was good but it came with a load of Ikura on top, and I'm not fan. Also, there was a layer of wasabi? cream in the middle which added to the creamy texture of the salmon and gave good color contract but I didn't think it added to the dish. \n\nThai Beef Salad - these were essentially Thai beef butter lettuce cups. The beef was tender and flavorful but this was certainly not spicy and I was expecting spicy. I guess I could have asked for sriracha. \n\nKalbi beef roll - I usually don' like rolls and especially cooked food rolls, but this was not bad. I think this is how they made it.... take a long slice of cooked kalbi (cut out the fat), bread with panko, flash fry, and then roll in sushi rice. Topping each roll was the Korean sweet spicy red sauce. \n\nAll in all, great food, great value. Would definitely come back!"

This is despite knowing  we were interested in their happy hour and wanted to try their bar menu. 8 minutes later, someone comes by and gives us a menu -  not the bar menu but their dinner menu. Finally we get their bar menu to peruse (it wasn't available on the internet because we checked) after we specifically ask for it about 5 minutes later.\n\nWe did notice that there was only one waiter at the time running between rooms and they were understaffed. One of the service staff (not our waiter) did come by and apologize for the service.\n\nWe ordered the pulled beef fries with green onion and wasabi cream ($5), tonkotsu ramen with bamboo shoots, green onion ($8) plus the pork belly ($2, four slices), and a serving of their cod slider ($4).\n\nFirst of all, a package of ramen you get at the Chinese supermarket is markedly superior to what they serve here. It's an insult to call the swill they serve here tonkotsu ramen - it completely lacked the full bodied flavour of pork. The noodles were overdone, the preserved bamboo had an unpleasant rank aroma. It was terrible all the way through. The addition of the anemic bland pork belly did the dish no favors.\n\nThe cod slider fared better but was still very unsatisfying. The fried cod lack crispness while it was definitely overwhelmed by the mayonaise-y tartar sauce. When they listed this as being bar \"bites\", they weren't kidding - the sammy was small. Quite frankly, a filet-o-fish would had been preferable and easier on the wallet.\n\nFinally, the pulled beef fries. The pulled beef short rib was one-note while the wasabi cream... didn't taste at all like wasabi. The gravy was also overly watery which made the so-so fries get soggy too quickly.\n\nGiven how this place performed during their happy hour, I would not consider trying Social House again. This place is barely edible and expensive to boot. Given the plethora of other great places to try on the Strip, this is definitely a pass. 2 stars."

As part of our wedding package, we were given dinner at Social House immediately following our wedding ceremony.\n\nWe arrived at ten pm on a Saturday night only to learn that they had the days mixed up and they had been expecting us the previous night. It wasn't a big deal though, as the restaurant was absolutely dead. There were maybe only two other tables being used. The bar was empty.\n\nWe were expecting something special for our wedding dinner, but the server didn't even mention it. He gave us a sheet with two options for our prix fixe menu. \n\nAgain, we were surprised that the menu didn't even look nice. It was just on a standard sheet of paper, nothing mentioning weddings or special events. It would have been very easy and cheap to make this a little extra nice. The server wasn't even aware of our options and had to look at the menu with us. We could't tell if he was just new or totally indifferent.\n\nWe went with the first option, which was seven courses. I can't remember all of the courses, but it  included a big variety. The sushi was okay and I liked the mixed- green salad. The miso cod was awful. We both took one bite and pushed it aside. I also didn't care for the pork buns, which were a fancy version of a cheap dish that I always get in Chinatown. We liked the pineapple cake for dessert.\n\nOur meal included two small bottles of a floral sake wine for a toast. We ended up ordering more alcohol and with tip, spent close to a hundred dollars. I have no clue what the actual value of our meal was, however, I would have preferred to have been given a dollar amount and ordered off of the regular menu. We would have rather had some sushi of our own choosing. The courses that we ate were really hit and miss. Nothing was outstanding.\n\nBesides the complete lack of acknowledging our special event ( especially since our dinner was arranged through the wedding chapel as part of their package), the service was spotty. At one point, three courses came out at the same time and often our drinks were left unfilled. Our server would disappear and another employee would have to track him down. It happened twice.\n\nThis restaurant was a huge let-down."

It feels like you're in a bank or something. \n\nAnyhow, didn't get to get a great look at the inside of the restaurant since our group was larger and they sat us outdoors ... No complaints since it was a last minute reservation for a large party. The only complaints were that it was really cold and even though they had heating lamps outside, the lamps were placed in no strategic order whatsoever.. Most of my friends were freezing and they told us the lamps were bolted down even though they werent.\n\nAnyways, on to the food... Before we got our food, I ordered a green tea cocktail that was mMmMMMm yummy. Usually with green tea cocktails, you can barely taste the tea, but they really know how to make a green tea cocktail here. You could taste the blend of alchol and also a strong green tea taste... it was delicious. As for the food, my boyfriend and I shared a shrimp tempura roll, Unagi w/Cream cheese, spicy tuna roll, and also Teriyaki Chicken.\n\nSo bottom line about Social House.. Very very good sushi, but also very expensive. But just like Rob T. mentions, if you want to have a good night in a nice restaurant w/good food, then this is for you. Unfortunately, the service we got wasn't so great... Maybe because we were younger, but who knows.\n\nbut let me tell you, it's pretty awesome sitting outdoors and having an amazing view of the strip while eating some good sushi... oh, and also a front row , from the top , seat for the TI SIRENS show...\n\ndefinitely memorable.. not sure if i would return since i can get amazing sushi for a much lower price.. but, this is definitely a great place for ambiance if you're with a group of friends and want to have a nice dinner out before a crazy night out on the strip."

As the bartender said \"they'll rot your brain!\" We were compltely transfixed on the movie within a minute, I don't know what it is about those movies...\n\nThe flavors were amazing and the special menu from your Foursquare check-in is always good and well-priced. \n\nGreat place to go for tasty sushi without making reservations."

First off when we made our reservation we didn't realize the happy hour menu is only available in the bar, no reservation needed. So after sorting that out we ordered the angry tuna roll kelp salad and the wagyu Bibb lettuce cups. All were excellent. We also had a variety of sushi all decent, and topped it off w mochi. Overall this place was decent but not amazing. The regular menu prices were a bit high but w the HH specials I think this place was a good value for a strip sushi joint."

            "review": "Oh man did Social House deliver!!\n\nThis was the perfect place to eat with my 2 friends before hitting the town on a Saturday night.  We loved everything that we ordered, but the 2 stand outs were the yellowtail sashimi w/ tempura jalapenos on top and our chilled watermelon saki drinks.  I'm really not a huge fan of saki, but theirs tasted like fresh squeezed watermelon juice.. of which I AM a fan.  I also liked that they serve it chilled because warm saki kinda grosses me out.  This was also the 1st time I have ever tried yellowtail sashimi, as I usually stick to ahi tuna and salmon sashimi... but Social House has now broken my old sashimi ordering routine for good.  The other items we enjoyed were the miso cod, crab & shrimp fried rice, and lychee beigents.\n\nYes, the food is a bit pricey, but Social House is still 5 stars in my book cuz of the awesome staff who totally HOOKED US UP for the night w/ VIP services at the new Christian Audigier Nightclub below, as well as LAX and PURE.  So really, the price we paid for dinner was totally worth it!  And who doesn't love skipping long lines, no cover, and free drinks?  Go and have a ball... we definitely did!  Oh, and I'd also recommend sitting on the patio for a great view.\n\nThanks Social House!  I'll be back for more!!"

            "review": "After eating at many Japanese restaurants In Southern California, I decided since I was going to Vegas, why not try one of the Japanese restaurants on the strip. So I landed at Social House inside Treasure Island.  \n\nThe look of the place was unique.  When you check in, they escort you to the second level and while walking up there, the walls resembled safety deposit boxes, which I thought was artistic.  \n\nThe service there was great.  The servers there were friendly and courteous, but when they made recommendations, I slightly started to laugh (quietly).  They started to praise certain dishes that are unique, but in reality anybody can whip it up at home.  \n\nNow the food.  It was good, but like I said it was not unique, nor was it fresh.  I have eaten at Kitayama in Costa Mesa, Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills, and you can taste the freshness.  My buddy kept on praising the fish here, saying it is as fresh as it can get.  I took a bite into the uni, sake(salmon), and sashimi dishes.  They were good, but not fresh.  For being high profiled Japanese restaurant, it seems like they concentrated more on the artistic looks of the food than the taste.\n\nIn my opinion, there will never be a great Japanese restaurant in Vegas.  In order for that to happen, California has to sink into the Pacific and then Vegas will have immediate access to the ocean to get fresh seafood.  Even though seafood comes in fresh on a daily basis by air or truck, the quality does go down from being refrigerated for a long period of time.  All in all, the design of the restaurant is interesting, the servers are polite and courteous, but I would recommend another restaurant if you are picky on taste like I am."

Rolls are about $25-30, but what do you expect 1. for sushi and 2. in Vegas?\n\nThe edamame in their sweet chili sauce was really good, and their kelp salad was good too. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.\n\nHowever, the service was really, really slow. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived around 10:30pm, which is late for dinner anyways. There were maybe 4 other tables there but for whatever reason it took soooo long for the food to come out. We were starving!\n\nFor 8 people, our bill was over $300. A bit steep in my opinion for good but average food. In a nutshell, good food but nothing spectacular, nice and friendly servers/ workers but slow service and a bit pricy for the value but a good, enjoyable meal. I wouldn't recommend this place but I also wouldn't recommend against it."

Anyway it was really interesting how they lit stacks of Asian newspapers. But no one really goes to restaurants for the decor - the food was okay.\nThe kobe beef sliders were reminiscent of typical diner fare, of course with a Las Vegas twist. We only stopped in for a bite, so I wish I could have sampled more sushi and sake. Desserts looked grand, from what I saw on the table of the couple next to us, which brings me to another negative point: the table spacing lacked elbow room. I felt like I was all up in the business of the couple next to us. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad at a busier time of day, so I leave it open at 4 stars."

We had the Seared Fluke, Seared Albacore roll and the Citrus Peel Miso Cod. The Seared Fluke was a white fish served sashimi style. It looked really plain when served, but the soy salt was what gave it an interesting flavor because the soy sauce flavor was super concentrated. The seared albacore roll which had spicy tuna, shrimp tempera and avocado, was also tasty. The miso cod was probably our favorite out of the three. The cod itself was pretty light, but it was prepared with the skin still on which gave it flavor and a nice chewy texture.\n\nFood was really good and service was above par but portion-wise I'll have to pass on coming back. Granted, we should have ordered more food for three people but even if I had eaten those three dishes alone, I would have still been hungry. Our bill came out to roughly $90 and I just can't see myself throwing down $90 again to still be hungry afterwards."

The table had quit a few different things and all were extremly happy. We were there for buisiness and made a reservation but when we were there we easily could have walked in, maybe it was early for Vegas becasue as we were leaving it seemed to be getting more packed.

I guess I should expect that since it's Vegas and all, but then be a little more generous with the portions then - K? 6 slices of see-through thin hamachi with a sliver of jalepeno on top? The whitefish appetizer was equally delicious and skimpy.\n\nPut it this way - we spent $$$ and still left hungry, but what we did eat was damn good."
