            "review": "After having to cancel the UYE planned for that Wednesday night we decided to take advantage of the fact that we had a babysitter in place and take the evening to enjoy a small Happy hour hop and what better way to do that then to kick it off at Satay..\n\nI was hoping that Jason would be there so i could introduce him to the wife, since the last time I had enjoyed satay was with the yelp crew at the CMYE.  Even though Jason was not there the staff that was there was super friendly just as i remembered and was more than fast with the drinks and service. \n\nWe decided to order a drink and a few appetizers and of course i had to go with the Singha which was ice cold and amazing, Becky ordered a Malaysian Mai Tia which looked great and got her night off to a great start. I recommended we order the satay along side our lumpia and crab rangoons and to my delight it was just as delicious as the first time. \n\nWe finished up our appetizers and were just about to pay the bill when the server said... Oh, hey how would you like to win a free trip to Thailand?.. I stopped for a second and said WHAT? So he stopped for a moment and explained the Singha corporation loyalty card.  For every Singha you drink you get one entry into the drawing that will take place at the end of the year at Satay which you do not have to be at to win.. Also if you eat lunch there and show your card you get buy one get one lunch specials with your loyalty card.. How sweet is that!!!\n\nI was impressed with Satay from the first time i tried it and i must Satay, I will continue to come here for the great happy hour eats and ice cold Singha!!"

            "review": "Spent the weekend at a conference not too far from here. After the last night, my boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere fun to go for dinner. We'd just had Thai food the night before at Lotus of Siam so we were heading (based on Yelp recommendations) to a tapas place. \n\nWhen we arrived at the shopping center, though, the place looked jam packed. We noticed Satay nearby and made a last-minute decision to have Thai again. I am so glad we did! This experience was far better than the highly rated Lotus. \n\nFirst of all, this place is beautiful. Romantic mood lighting and comfortable booths. We  cuddled up together and ordered a beer and a cucumber martini, which was on their specials board. The bartender came out from behind the bar to ask us how we liked the drink! It was really delicious, muddled with basil, and so aromatic. Our waitress was really lovely as well.\n\nWe started with calamari satay which was yummy, not too chewy, and came with a delicious sauce. Then we had coconut rice (do not miss the opportunity to have this!) and lamb with red curry sauce and beef short ribs. We both loved our respective dishes so much that we were happy not to share, though we did sample the others' dish. My lamb was to die for. The sauce was perfect. Spicy, savory, buttery. And the lamb was falling apart in my mouth tender. The beef ribs were also crazy delicious with a sweet vinegary sauce.\n\nThe prices are super reasonable and we had a wonderful time! Will definitely return."

However, I was pleasantly surprised how well the cooks/chefs made every dish.  It was a pleasant surprise to get good satay along with perfectly cooked lamb chops.\n\nRecommended if you want a a quiet Asian affair."

The noodles tasted fine but there was definitely no extra tofu in it\n\n2. The hubs ordered Nasi Goreng with extra tofu. Again no extra tofu. And this dish was awful. It was SWEET. Nasi Goreng in its traditional form is spicy and salty and there is no hint of sugar. It was actually really bad.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone else enjoyed their dishes very much and our waiter was friendly  and helpful."

Portions were perfect. Not too much, not too little. \n\nWe came in for lunch and the service was attentive and friendly. The restaurant wasn't too busy so it was a nice, chill ambiance. Most of us ordered from the Lunch Special menu. \n\nI enjoyed my L3 Spicy Basil with beef and coconut rice. It was wok-fried with green beans, bell peppers, & basil leaves. Yum! And washed it down with a Thai Iced Coffee. You can choose your level of heat (1-10) on most of the dishes and i enjoyed a level 5 for my dish. I may try a 7 or 8 next time."

We decided to give it a try since we had gone to Firefly the previous night and I've always seen this place and never actually thought to try it. We were a group of 6 and kind of did this family style. Let's try to make this quick:\nRoti Canai - small plate flatbread with curry dip.. very good.. needs more flatbread!\nLumpia - delicious\nCrispy Chow Mein w/ Chicken - by far my favorite dish of the night!\nGreen Curry w/Chicken - Kacey ordered and loved it.... I didn't try\nFragrant Coconut Rice - I didn't care for it but Kacey did\nOrange Chicken - I ordered but thought it was average\nSweet and Sour Chicken - much better than Orange Chicken, good flavor\nThai Garlic Beef - tasty and you get to choose how spicy you would like it\nChicken Satay - chicken on a stick. pretty basic.\n\nStaff was friendly, plenty of seating on a Saturday at dinner time... look forward to another trip to try some more items. Kacey seemed to like much more than I did though."

While I doubt the overall knowledge of the staff about Thai cuisine, their friendliness and professional demeanor make up for this. The lunch special is reasonably priced and definitely a good portion size, considering the relatively inexpensive menu. I've eaten here before but had forgotten how good it really is. I don't know about how the evening experience is, but the mid-afternoon is quite hip and relaxing. If you're in the area, it's a great value! Also note there are Malaysian and Indonesian dishes which are available in addition to, and also fused within, some of the menu items. I will definitely return!"

They didn't skimp on roast duck; not only was it meaty, it was also reasonably priced. The individual satay options are perfect if you're looking for a small snack and don't want to pay too much for it.\n\nThe service here is friendly, but can get slow when it's busy. Another plus is that it's open till 11 on weekdays so you can find my sorry butt working here late."

Upon entering Satay the staff is extremely friendly. All smiles. \n\nThis visit I was pretty hung over when I came in to have dinner. I decided on the Roti As well as the Yellow Curry these are usually my go to dishes for Thai spots fuck it up and well I probably won't be going back. \n\nAnywho I was pretty in out as soon as I sat down I told the host I knew what I wanted and that I could pay immediately. \nIt didn't take long for my food to arrive and when it did it was hot and the portion sizes were good. The Roti Canai  which arrived first was simply delicious as you should expect in a good thai sauce. The same goes for the Yellow curry which I ordered with vegetable no tofu. I'm so used to having watered down curries that drop like water it was good to know that this Thai place knows what theyre doing when it comes to curry.\n\nMy only tiff when it comes to Satay is that considering that when I arrived it was dead I had every single server on site stop by my table. Um... I'm sure I only have one server not 5. But even with that said service was pleasant \n\nAnyway if you're in Vegas stop by sit down and eat. But here's a tip Most places that say they do delivery don't not on the strip anyway. So call beforehand and double check if they'll even stop at your hotel"

We paid an extra $3 for the Eggplant dish and they only added 4-5 shrimps.. but the sauce and eggplant were perfect! The Curry Laksa was really good also. You can order level of spiciness on a scale of 1-10. The 7 wasn't that spicy for me, but I can handle a lot. I would pass on the Roti next time - it was just average."

More for American taste bud as they seem to like sweet a lot more.\n\nChicken Satay - probably the only thing that tasted good. Really thin piece of chicken and the cucumber salad that came with it was drenched in some sort of syrup so it was super sweet. \n\nCalamari - needs to be fried more so it's actually crunchy and more salt added. Most of the pieces we ate had no taste to it.\n\nChicken Wing - was okay but it was fried and drenched in more sweet thick syrup.\n\nThai Tea - beyond sweet. I literally could've poured my cup into 2 different cups, add more water and wala, got myself 2 Thai tea drinks. That's how sweet it is.\n\nTom Kha - nasty stuff. Not fresh and overcooked.\n\nPad Thai - wet, not dry and sweet. \n\nBeef Fried Rice - was okay, not the best flavor. \n\nBeef Pad Se Eew - looked so burnt up. It was so spicy to the point you can't enjoy the food.\n\nAll in all, everything was too sweet. Spice level is not the same. A few of us order with a level 6, some where super spicy and the others didn't taste spicy at all. \n\nService sucked. It was great before we got our food, always refilling our water and what not. Then once the food comes, not even once they came to refill our water or asked if everything was fine.

Taking a tables order who sat before me and haven't even asked for my drink order is plain rude. This has happened on a number of times. Once ok maybe I let slide but a few times after is ridiculous. Also service is slow. There have been occasion when my coworkers and I end up coming back to work late from lunch because they took forever to get our bill and food took longer than needed to come out. For any restaurant food should take average 15 mins to come out unless noted or advised by wait staff.\nNow the food. It's bleh. As I have said before it does not amaze. They have gone through a few menu changes since I've first been here. Sorry but I'd rather drive a little further and get better tasting thai food and better service. ..maybe if you are white they might be more attentive...just saying while observing you can tell  they prefer certain colors better."

The best part is they have a vegetarian menu and all the gluten free options are labeled, and they have a lot to choose from!  The ambiance is nice, clean, and pretty.  The servers are nice and professional.  They refilled our waters and came to check on us in good time.  The window table is drafty though on cold Vegas nights so we moved to a middle table and they were totally fine with that.  Their patio is under renovation but looks like it will be totally cool to chill there when its done.\nI LOVE their Singapore curry vermicelli stir-fry.  It is so addicting good.  It's spicy though so just a warning.  It's gluten free and vegetarian.  The bok choy with garlic stir-fry is delicious, maybe too much garlic for me but yummy (gluten free, vegan).  The summer rolls were pretty good, I wasn't that into the sauce but rolls were good (gluten free, vegetarian).  Momma's curry, a yellow curry was good and nice and warm on cold nights (gluten free, vegetarian).  It has a very nice chill atmosphere and feels refined so its very nice.\nFree parking in the strip mall lot is a big plus!\nThanks for a great meal and the sweet Thai hospitality!"

The location made it convenient (2-3 miles from the airport) and it showed up with a high rating on yelp (something our server took pride in :) ).\n\nOverall the food was quite good, if a touch oily/heavy. Our server was excellent, willing to take last minute adjustments to our food and he knew the menu, was able to make meaningful suggestions without overdoing it. Will totally visit again, next time I'm in Vegas :).\n\n+ Tom Yum Soup : average, nothing out of the ordinary, but not bad either. Had a spicy level of seven, that made us change our minds and alter the rest of your meal for 5s and 6s :). That kinda made me happy, I've seen enough \"americanized\" thai places were even a ten doesnt make you flinch.\n\n+ Fresh Coconut water : both my friends had some. Both liked it, freshly cut and sweet according to them.\n\n+ Green Curry : always the safe choice at most Thai places :), was good. The tofu chunks were nice, the gravy fairly tasty. All that I'd expect from a good Thai green curry, without really blowing me away. \n\n+ Narsi Goreng : good. A little oily and the egg wasnt done well enough.\n\n+ Crispy noodles with Chicken breasts : friend ordered this and was most definitely the best thing we had at our table that day. Very tasty gravy/broth which melded quite well with the crispy noodles. (I hadnt seen this preparation/dish for a long time, and it reminded me of similarly awesome preparation I had back in my home town six or seven years ago. I was grateful for the little gastronomic  trip down memory lane!)\n\n- Slightly pricy I guess : $75 without alcohol for the three of us.\n- The woman refilling the water seemed ridiculously un-interested in getting us any water. It arrived 10-15 mins after we had been seated, despite repeated requests :|\n- Could have done with a little less oil :("

The flavor of the curry laksa wasn't so bad but for some reason, the chicken inside was only room temperature. My husband asked them to make him a fresh one and they insisted that it was fresh and that if they made it again it would be exactly the same. So my husband decided to order a different soup and got the coconut chicken soup instead. Again, the chicken in the soup came out room temperature. We don't know how they've managed to do it twice with two different soups!\n\nI ordered the beef rendang and it was just ok, nothing special about it. The server asked me and I told her honestly what I thought about it but I told her that it was fine. I guess she told her supervisor coz next thing u know, the manager comes to our table. The part that irritated me the most was that he made us seem like we were lying about our complaints on the temp Of our food. To make it worse, the manager then proceeds to tell me that I probably haven't tasted authentic Asian food. I'm Asian and I've tried so many different authentic Asian food. They just managed to make theirs absolutely nothing special and not worth my money.\n\nI'm only giving the second star for our server because she was very nice.\nTo sum this all up, it was a waste of money. Needless to say, my husband and I will not be going back there again."

It has been some time since I have had Laksa ($9.99) and was craving this hodge podge of meats and noodles in a coconut curry soup. I usually like shrimp in mine, but theirs comes with chicken, fried tofu, fish balls, vermicelli noodles, and egg noodles. It was tasty anyways. I liked how they give the chilies and hot sauces on the side so that the spiciness can be adjusted while dining. Their serving size is large. A bowl would put most normal people out of commission, but I downed my meal and ate off my friends plates as well. I am not proud of this fact, but my work schedule plus my obsessive need to go to the gym has magnified my hunger. For now, it has not worked against me. \n\nMy friends got the Korean Short Ribs ($14.99) and the Sweet and Sour Chicken ($12.99). The beef was tough, but the marinade was good. The poultry dish was standard. The option of getting jasmine, brown, or coconut rice is available. We finished with an order of Roti ($5.50) with condense milk and powdered sugar. The fat kid in me always jumps at the chance to eat fried food tossed in sugar, but these were nothing special. \n\nWe had also got the Call A Cab and Red Dragon ($10 each and $5 during HH) specialty drinks. Their drinks are good because they taste like juice. This can go one of two ways; either you can be vomiting in a bathroom stall, or it really is just juice.

It came in a big bowl with fish balls, chicken, tofu and lots of noodles.  The price was quite reasonable for $10 a bowl.  I don't care for too spicy dishes, so this mild version was perfect for me.  My wife had their beef redang which was also very delicious.  The portions are very reasonable.  This place seems to be a local favorite and I am a fan now too.  For anyone who has a taste for Thai, come here and give this place a try."

The service is top notch, and it doesn't matter if a server is assigned to your table or not, they all ensure you have everything you need.  \n\nThe menu is diverse and offers Thai, Malaysian and some Chinese.  They have a broad tapas menu with common offerings such as Buddha fresh vegetable rolls, egg rolls, samosas, gyoza, and more unique items such as grilled lamb chops and Thai tacos. Many of their tapas are on the happy hour menu for as little as  $3. We order about 6 tapas with our entrees and always end up with too much food (which, is not a problem IMHO).\n\nThe food quality is out of this world, and we have yet to have a bad meal here. Honestly, if you're in Vegas, stop here for a meal in their classy but casual restaurant; you will NOT be disappointed!"

The veggies! You're not walking out of this place paying less than $8.50 on yourself for a lunch meal. \nI LOVE their Panang curry. It comes with a protein of your choice and served with bell peppers, salad, and rice for Lunch. Today, I ordered it and I literally got 3 thin slices of bell pepper. \nThis place does have great food and decent service but for the price and what they give you for vegetables, I feel it's over priced, otherwise it'd be a 5* place.\nI go here every now and again. Maybe a few times a year, and it's walking distance from where I work. They need to up their veggie game and I would probably go there more often."

I've been to Asian restaurants where the rice noodles were old and hard, or the food was too salty because someone drowned the dish in soy sauce. The beef char kway teow was none of thise things.  I also ordered a side of coconut rice that did not disappoint. It even came with the hot red sauce that accompanies Singapore chicken rice, and that made the coconut rice more delicious.\n\nI was ultimately very happy with my decision, especially in a city where it seems that most restaurants are serving burgers or steak."

Staff has always been friendly and attentive and some friends and I have watched a few of the NBA play off games there. There is a chill lounge area with low leather couches/tables where they have a projection screen for big games.

We decided that some Asian food sounded good so we stopped by.\n\nWe had two episodes of \"Mad Men\" on Netflix to watch - so we wanted to get in and out of there. We figured out that we wanted to share roti canai, spring rolls, pad see ew, and some rice. We placed the order immediately for the whole thing, and we told the waitress that she could just bring it all out at the same time.\n\nAbout 45 minutes, we got it all at the same time. She was very apologetic, and she complimented my girlfriend for having a \"pretty face\" at least 3 times, so that makes the wait more palatable I suppose!\n\nAs for the food itself, it was not bad. The roti canai was delicious, actually. I definitely recommend this as a great starter to share. The pad see ew was not as good as some other places I have been, but the spring rolls were piping hot and delicious.\n\nAll in all, this place is fine. It's clean, and the food is average or better. The service is lacking, though (it was not crowded when we were there). If you're staying at one of the smaller hotels in the area and want some low key Asian food that is fairly priced, this is a good option. If you're not in the area or want something better, then skip."

I was definitely surprised when my boyfriend took me here (instead of Firefly), and I realized what I'd been missing out on for quite some time.  \n\nWith the exception of anything extremely spicy (definitely can't handle that with my sensitive stomach), I've enjoyed quite a bit of the menu.  I've had the following: \n\nMango Tofu -  Iused to order this a lot until I realized what I was missing when it came to eating BEEF.  Still a pretty tasty alternative, and large enough portions that if you eat this alone, you could probably still manage to take some home \n\nLemongrass Chicken - Pretty tasty and one of my favorites.  The first time I had this dish, I almost finished it all by myself.  Lol.\n\nTeriyaki Chicken - delicious\n\nThai BBQ Pork Spareribs - I snatched one of these from a friend's plate and he almost bit my fingers off.  Haha.  He, on the other hand, demolished the rest of the ribs and seriously kept gnawing at the rest of the meat on the bone, cherishing every bite.\n\nBeef Rendang - Tender, full of flavor, and another favorite dish that I've had from time to time.  I can't say that I've been disappointed whenever I've eaten this dish.  Even though it's marked as spicy on the menu, we were able to have the spice level taken down, thankfully.  \n\nYakitori Chicken Satay - I generally tend to get an order of these each time that I eat here.  The chicken is tender, but I really like the dipping sauce a lot more, in addition to the accompaniments--cucumber and onion.\n\nBlack Pepper Beef - I also like this dish.  Yes, I seem to like a lot of meat dishes, but with pepper and beef, I figured you couldn't really go wrong.  \n\nBrown Rice - standard brown rice\n\nCoconut Rice - Pretty yummy, although I don't really eat rice.  It's different, though--sweet, but still rice.\n\nThai Sticky Rice - This is another dish that I have tried, but is an acquired taste, as I am not really partial to rice.\n\nVegetable Spring Roll - Another basic staple that I order when I eat here.  Even though it's your standard fresh roll, the sauce is delicious, and the freshness is hard to beat.\n\nHar Gow - what you would typically find when going out for dim sum\n\nPad See Ew - LOVE this dish.  Noodles, eggs, broccoli, soy sauce = yummy.  I tend to just grab a tiny bit of this, but usually end up eating half, if not 3/4 of the entire dish. Lol.\n\nHouse Fried Rice - This is one of the few rice dishes that I will willingly eat, especially with some extra Garlic.  YUM.\n\nThai Garlic Chicken - Chicken breast with garlic upon garlic?  Obviously I am a fan. \n\nHainan Chicken - I like this as a healthy alternative, mainly because this is steamed.  I also think that the sesame soy sauce helps bring out the tenderness of the chicken, as well as the full flavor.  Be prepared, though, that this is a HUGE dish.\n\nThai Garlic Beef - Beef, garlic sauce, and garlic?  Again, a fan of this dish. \n\nMango Sticky Rice - my boyfriend's definitely a fan of this dessert, as he loves rice, sweets, and mango.\n\nDelicious, delicious, delicious.  I can't help but talk about how much of this menu I love.\n\nIn addition, the service is great (I've eaten with larger parties of 10 to smaller parties of 2) and they're quite attentive, friendly, and helpful when it comes to suggestions and refills.\n\nMy only problem is that the lot gets packed at night, so plan accordingly (the plaza shares a parking lot with Firefly, Ruth's Chris, and other restaurants/businesses.\n\nI will say, though, that I've enjoyed coming here--whether to grab a bite after going out, enjoying a quick lunch, sitting on the patio and listening to the DJ spin or even just sitting indoors and enjoying the company of friends/family/my significant other--despite the reason.\n\nCan't wait to come back..."

A hip, fun place to hang out but with tasty food and drinks that will keep me coming back. Prices are quite reasonable, particularly for the quality. The Happy Hour has been mentioned a lot on Yelp - and for good reason. A Happy Hour that doesn't end until 8 PM? Freaking SWEET. \n\nWe sampled many of the appetizer-esque foods - satays, wontons, and chicken wings. All were incredibly tasty. I was pleasantly surprised by the chicken wings . Forget BW3 - come here for your chicken wing fix. The sweet glaze with just a touch of heat was perfect.Their namesake satays were also a winner! The glaze on them was perfect and no chewy meat here. \n\nWe were so happy with the appetizers we ordered a half duck ($14) from the menu. We were given a choice of many delish sounding rices (jasmine, coconut, white, brown) and went with the coconut. The duck was perfect - moist with beautiful crisp skin and the coconut rice was amazing. It wasn't  the sticky dessert type rice you get at most places - it was white rice with just a perfect subtle coconut flavor. If only they gave me a bucket of that rice - I might have been able to finish it ! \n\nGreat owner, great beer (who doesn't like drinking beer out of freaking cool towers?), great patio, great food.. definitely recommend it for locals and tourists alike. We're going into patio season - take advantage !"

            "review": "Yes, I used to work here too.  I know, I probably have had more jobs than anyone has ever used the bathroom to pee.  But, I came here with my cousin a few weeks ago and have been meaning to write about it.  That day we went, I was craving for something hot and soupy so that's where we landed.  \n\nWhen I walked in for the first time in a year, I felt a sense of deja-vu.  It felt like I was walking in with my black mini skirt, bustier, FM boots, and heavy make up ready to serve cocktails and shots to customers.  But, I quickly erased that from my mind after seeing my old manager and greeting her hello with a warm hug.  The look of the place is still the same, nothing had changed.  The lighting above the bar is still luminescent with orange and red, and the restaurant laid out with tables and dim lights hanging just above it.  The only thing that was different was the lounge, there used to be a lounge and coffee table by the front door but that had been replaced with a large table for a large party.   What was an addition was a lounge room.  I'm not sure what that is used for.  I remember they said they wanted to make that room in to a pole room with Go-go dancers.  This place used to be very packed on Fridays and Saturdays with B-boys and little school kids who would sneak a beer here and there.  I actually hated how they would let 18 year olds party here.  But, I guess what ever any one can do in order to gain profit.  If kids can get away with it, why not?\n\n\nAfter a small conversation with my ex-boss, I found my cousin and was ready to order.  The appetizers are the best here.  Chicken Satay is normally cooked to perfection but this time it was a little over cooked.  They also have a Roty Canay normally super great but a little too doughy that night.  For a Main Course, I ordered Laksa.  I'm usually skeptical about hot and spicy food because it can't be too spicy.  But after putting a small amount in my mouth, I found it wasn't too spicy and it wasn't too hot in temperature.  That was prepared just perfectly.  The fish balls, chicken, vegetables all combined with the coconut and curry taste soup was just what I needed to warm up after a cold breezy day.  One of my cousins ordered Pad Thai and I wouldn't recommend that.  They don't make great Pad Thai's here.  It had a farty after taste and didn't smell very good.  But then again, I've never had a Pad Thai that didn't smell weird.  I am definitely going back for more Laksa  just coz it's the best food for a cold season."

It frustrates me to no end. \nI've been here more times than I can count and I have only had good service once and that was because the owner herself was taking care of me due to some party. \nToday I went and misjudged my party's size instead of being a three top we became a six top. The girl rolled her eyes and looked pissed that I needed a bigger table. If it was slammed I could understand but we were the only table in the restaurant.\nIt took the two servers over ten minutes to get me a water, my friends had to ask for their drinks three times. On the third time they actually went to the bar and asked for the beers. The shocker in all this we were the only table. Being in the industry myself I could understand beers/waters taking awhile but being the only freaking table in the whole restaurant it's just ridiculous. I'm about at my limit with this restaurant but I'm addicted to their Pad Thai and Panang Curry. \nI just want the service to be better I feel like their servers could care less about their jobs. I just want it fixed so that I can love this place."

The place is packed with people people who needed a good meal after CES. We were seated by an extremely kind hostess who was very personable and warned that it would take a bit to get our food but assured someone would be at our tables soon. Our waiter came in no time to take our order. We started off with curry samosas (YASSSS) which came with a good portion. For our entr\u00e9es we ordered pad Thai with chicken and a panang curry with chicken. I will say the pad Thai was lacking spiciness (I ordered a spicy lvl 5) but my problem was resolved by adding some chilies to it. Both dishes were cooked very well and packed with lots of flavor. I also tried the Thai tea which had the perfect amount of sweetness and not too sweet like I find most Thai teas to be. Our waiter was amazing! With a fully packed restaurant, he was able to keep our glasses full of water and make sure we were doing good while dealing with multiple tables and running around. A+ for the service. The receipt says \"server: M\" which makes it hard to give you a shout out but Mr. M if you're reading this; THANK YOU! :)"

I met my husband here for lunch and came on a very humid day. It was extremely cold inside the restaurant. You have to inhale your meal before the air cools it down. The service is eh. My waiter had bad breathe. The water although I know may be tap, even with a couple of lemon wedges was gross. Next time I'll stick to the Thai restaurants on spring mountain.

There is one simple reason for this - they are the only place I know of in Vegas that serves Laksa.\n\nOK so I've since heard that both Penang Malaysian Cuisine and Noodles also serve this delicious spicy soup. But I have yet to try their renditions. I really should be giving Satay five stars, but I must concede that their Laksa isn't quite as good now as I remember it previously. I think one of the reasons is that they now mix thicker noodles with the more standard vermicelli noodles. Also, for some reason, the broth now appears darker and not as creamy.\n\nStill, for a good bowl of Laksa, I know where I can go; I just have to ask them to exclude the thick noodles."

Myself & another friend did some recon on local Thai restaurants and read some reviews & the menu & decided to check it out.  Wanted something preferrably off the strip, reasonably priced with a menu that was big enough to cater to all of us.\n\nWe stayed at the Flamingo & took a taxi over - about a 10 minute ride.  It was a Tuesday night around 9pm I believe by the time we got there & there were literally 5 or 6 other patrons inside.  Waiter who greeted us was very friendly, younger, fun, just the kind of waiter we needed since we are a loud & crazy group.  \n\nMe & the other friend who decided on this restaurant are semi-knowledgeable on our Thai cuisine - so we knew we would be critical when it came time to eat. Waiter recommended the phuket-tini for a drink = a mojito-style martini.  All 6 of us got one and we could have probably all ordered 3 or 4 more, they were amazing.  We started off with cucumber salad, eggrolls and chicken satay as appetizers.  I ordered the Thai spicy beef salad (which I know as yum nua), others ordered the panang curry, sizzling black pepper beef, pad thai, pad prik and the honey walnut shrimp.  It was so good that we all ended up sharing off of everyone's plate.  There was not one complaint about the food.\n\nBy the time we were done, there was only 1 other couple in there and it was getting late.  The waiter was very prompt and attentive.  We ended up splitting the bill since all of our food was around the same price plus our drink.  We each spent $30 which was drink, appetizer, entree.  It was by far the best meal we had over the entire 3 days we spent in Vegas.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Satay.  It's nice to get out of the hustle & bustle of the strip...and if you're into Thai food they have a great menu at a good price.  Definitely will return if and when I get back to the city!"

We decided To go here vs other places because we had had a good experience and of course because all I want is Thai and one closer to home is well \"less fancy\"\n\nUpon entering we waited to be seated which was quick & I was able to pick where we could sit (a lil bit larger table than one just designed for two people) since we had our 16month old daughter with us. \n\nIt took them a while to get drink orders. I didn't mind because I did notice they were busy. Our waitress arrived right as we got done giving the order for drinks. Drinks arrived promptly. I had ordered garlic basil fries but with (no basil) few other items & Roti Canai. \n\nI had loved roti Canai here before so I knew I would love it again. \n\nOur order took a while again understandable since they were busy. In the mean time my very active bladder called and I when I got to the restroom I realised the bigger of the two stalls had no toilet paper!!!!! Seriously I don't care how busy you guys get keep toilet paper in restroom & clean it for goodness sake.\n\nUpon returning the food had arrived and well the fries had basil on them. Smh. The Roti was undercooked and doughy. Wish I had taken pictures to post!!!!! \n\nOur waitress said she will have them redo the fries and roti. I have a 16 month old who was hard enough to keep still the food going in and out of the kitchen was delaying her eating, & my eating. We had friends we had to meet up with after. Roti Canai went back twice and we just gave up. Fries did finally come but had no garlic nor garlic flavouring. Waitress waited till my drink was empty to refill. It was a disastrous experience  !!!!! I finally asked if they were busy and they said yes the magic convention was in town. Not an excuse for horrible service can't handle a crowd then please shut down!!!!!! We hated the entire experience and I wasn't shy to let them know. I even had to get up myself to go get napkins because of lack of service. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 wondered if they had a manager on duty since no one had come to apologise for food being sent back multiple times. I told him not one person there looked like a manager and I doubt he/she was there. I was right. He/she wasn't. \n\nUpon signing the check and of course I tipped just towards the low end (15%) I was asked was everything good I said NO and we didn't like the food or service. The guy assured me he would pick up our tab next visit....yeah I believed him (not). \n\nSafe to say you guys ruined our Valentine's Day dinner for my daughter, my fianc\u00e9 (who kept apologising for their horrible service to me) and mine. \n\nDO NOT GO HERE IF THEY ARE BUSY, apparently the wait staff and kitchen can't handle it."

We were the only customers, but it made for a nice romantic setting in the dimly lit restaurant. \n\nAfter perusing through the diverse menu, we decided upon the following:\n\nGrilled Calamari: Marinated and served w/ sweet and spicy garlic lime sauce - We both weren't very fond of this, but only because we're so used to having fried calamari, so we were a little taken back by  the texture and flavor \n\nChicken Tom Yum soup: Hot and sour soup w/ lime juice, lemongrass, mushrooms, and chicken - Honestly, I think this was the first time either of us have ordered Tom Yum soup and we were instantly in love. We've ordered Tom Yum about 4 times at other places after having it here and nothing has really compared. They use fresh mushrooms and there is a perfect 50/50 taste of hot and sour. All of the ingredients just go together so perfectly with not a single ingredient standing out more than another, which is the main problem I find at other restaurants. \n\nPad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle): Flat rice noodle, stir-fried Thai style w/ egg, bell pepper, onion, tomato, and basil - Perfectly portioned and served on an oversized plate. We finished the entire dish. The eggs, bell pepper, and basil definitely gave it a nice \"kick.\" The noodles were well cooked, not too hard and not soggy at all, just right. \n\nThai Garlic Beef: Sliced beef stir-fried Thai style in garlic sauce topped with crispy garlic served with crispy cucumbers and a sweet/sour sauce - Whenever we see the world \"Garlic\" on the menu, about 90% of the time we end up ordering the item. This dish was soo flavorful and aromatic. There was a lot of garlic, but it was crispy and enjoyable, not raw and painful like I've experienced with other garlic dishes. It went perfectly with the drunken noodles. \n\nAll in all, I'd love to come back here again. Perfect place for dates and I'm sure it's also perfect for groups during happy hour."

We were greeted as soon as we got into the door and seated immediately.  Our server was so nice and had a great energy about her.  She gave us time to look over the menus and I can honestly say that we had a hard time making a selection since it was so varied.  Definite plus.\nWe ordered the following- Garlic Asparagus, Pad See Ew, and the Steak Salad.  Everything was delicious and on point.  My only regret is not living closer because this would definitely be my go to Thai place.\nWe also had a few drinks which were super yummy and on happy hour too, to top it off.  $5 a drink and some bomb food.

            "review": "This is a \"fusion\" restaurant, so the people looking for a completely authentic meal will be disappointed. That said, the flavors aren't bad here. \n\nI had the roti canai, steak & chicken satay, and the curry laksa. The roti canai was the most disappointing. It is basically identical to the frozen canai/pratha that you can buy from many Asian supermarkets. However, the accompanyin curry was quite good, which redeems it a little. \n\nThe satay was the opposite; the peanut sauce was disappointing (too thick and too sweet), but the meat was quite good. The satay here has that charred flavor that is unique to satay. However, the chicken satay could have used more seasoning, the flavor was definitely on the weak side. Another thing they could do to improve the satay is to use less meat on each skewer and increase the number of skewers in each serving. I bet if they cooked it that way, the flavor of each skewer will improve significantly. \n\nThe curry laksa was also decent. Instead of my preferred choice of short thick rice noodles, they serve the laksa with vermicilli (bee hoon) and egg noodles. My least favorite part was the slices of chicken breast that were in the noodle; they were just very bland. The fish balls were decent, though I'm more familiar with fish cakes in laksa. The fried tofu was the best part of the dish.\n\nOverall, the flavors here are pretty good, just don't expect a completely authentic dining experience."

Misti said 'Asian small plates rock' and I was sold. However I wasn't exactly thrilled about Singha beer, but I was willing to give it a shot anyway. \n\nWhen we first sat down and I saw the sad selection of happy hour apps, and the fact that they only had Singha on special, was almost a deal breaker. But we already drove all the way down there, so we both went for one of the tropical drink specials, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. My Sawa-tea was tasty and what a deal at $5! We finally broke out of our rut here too and ordered something besides the usual papaya salad and massaman curry (the first time that is). The satay was super fresh, the veggies were done perfectly both times. The green bean curry type dish we had the first time was also incredible! I want to know, \"where do they get there beans?\" they are absolutely the best ever! \n\nThis past weekend we had to go again and try out the papaya salad, substituting grilled shrimp for the typical dried shrimps, sounded perfect and it was. Without a doubt this is the best papaya salad I have ever had and I can't wait to go back for another! So overall the food is OUTSTANDING, the service is OK and the only major problem I can find is the Singha beer, where's the Chang? Or at least Tiger? Anything but Singha!"

Light, crunchy and fresh!\n\nTom Kha soup: Simple, fresh, light, delicious!  I added a couple spoonfuls of red curry to make it more of a Tom Kai Gai type soup!  \n\nRed Curry (NOT Panang): Delicious!  Heavy, rich sauce (which is usual), yummy bellpeppers,choice of jasmine, brown or coconut rice! \n\nThough I didn't try anything else due to being full enough to BUST, everyone else was very pleased with their choices!\n\nAlso they have a great beer, alcohol and wine selection..and though we did not go during happy hour, the menu (for happy hour) looked GREAT!!"

It was a happy misfortune on our part.  It is spacious and perfect for out of control loud discussions amongst good friends.\n\nI ordered the Singapore noodles, because I'm also craving curry to go with my beer.  The blended seasoning of tumeric, curry and other spices and herbs successfully imbued that trademark smell and taste upon the noodles.  Super yummy for a super afternoon.\n\nMy GF, ordered the Chicken Satay, which she says is a terrific flavorful and deliciously tender nuggets on the skewer.

We were staying off the strip doing some business and Yelpers helped us find this place when we were very hungry, it was getting late, and we were on the way back to the hotel.  \n\nI had Chicken with Vegetables and Brown Rice.  It was all good and I could return for the same.  The chicken tasted fresh, no aftertaste, like we have encountered in other Thai places.\n\nService was \"matter of fact\" and efficient.\n\nAtmosphere is casual--not really a romantic dating environment--more for friends get together, established couples, or family or dining alone. \n\nPrices are reasonable for the area.\n\nParking is free and easy.\n\nWe would return again next time in the area."

The menu is extensive and there were several items on the lunch specials menu for $7.95-9.95. The prices are good compared to other restaurants in town. \n\nWe ordered a Pad See Ew and the Padang curry with brown rice. Both dish were very flavorful and tasty. The rice noodles were soft and fresh. The tables and floor are clean and so are the bathrooms. Service was efficient, although a bit slow at times. Overall a good experience."

We were fortunate that Firefly was so busy because Satay is a gem.\nWe arrived when Happy Hour was still going on so we ordered some appetizers from the menu at a discount. We got the Thai nachos and the Lumpai--both were excellent. The wife got lamb curry for the entree and loved it. The sauce was flavorful and spicy, the lamb super tender. I got the Malaysian satay with dark chicken meat. It was very juicy and not at all dry. I liked it a lot, one of the best satays I have had. I also had a small house salad and the carrot dressing was excellent. Don't be put off by the  location off the strip, this place is a better value and the food is way better than the corporate chains on the strip. I would return here in a heartbeat."

If ever the customer want to take out something in the ingredients like if they are allergic to shrimp or squid they should have just request for it. There might be a new management or they cut cost, i just want to say to the management in charge you should have put the price up a little bit if you want to do that but dont changed the ingredients that the customers are used to because we just order it now its not the same as we like it.

So in we went.  Dead as a graveyard.  But we were early since it was only 5pm.  We spotted Roti and coconut rice on the menu and knew we had to try it since my fiance likes it.  For the main dish, we asked the the server for his recommendation for a good Malaysian dish and he suggested the Rendeng (Beef Curry) so we said, what the hey...this only one of a a few Malaysian dishes we spotted on the menu.  The food was just fair.  The roti was normal with a runny curry dipping sauce.  The coconut rice was okay, fluffy with coconut flavor.  The beef tasted okay and was tender but looked like a pile of poo.    The prices were a little above average and the service was good but why shouldn't it be if there are no customers.

I definitely recommend this restaurant for their delicious curries, satay, noodle dishes and veggie options.  My staff highly recommends the restaurant, too.

Nice place to bring a date since it is WAY dark inside with a full bar so if all else fails and your date isn't impressed with the food, you can always get her drunk and have your way with her in one of the somewhat secluded booths.\n\nWas not impressed with the food. Roti was served like Chinese scallion pancakes without the scallions. Accompanying curry sauce was flavorless even lil guy wouldn't eat it. Rojak was totally wrong. The sauce had no trace of shrimp paste (belachan) and the ratio of fresh vegs to the fried items was unbalanced. UGH!!! I even told the guy I wanted a heat level of 8/10 but when I tasted it I could not detect any heat in the rojak. Hubby got the curry laksa which was the only thing which my palate recognized though it was missing something. It did have curry leaves so that was a plus. However was not perfect by any means.\n\nService was too much. Every 3mins someone would ask if everything was ok and it would rotate between these 2 servers throughout our meal. Then when it came time to pay it took forever. Go figure.\n\nAuthentic it's not. Nor is it cheap, but I guess you're paying for decor."

Their martinis are delicious and you HAVE to try their garlic basil fries.  They are the best fries in Vegas.  The prices in general are low, which is surprising since they are right off of the Strip.  My husband and I never spend more than $40-$50 including apps, alcohol & entree.\n\nThe staff is always super sweet and they seem to really appreciate their regulars.

Long story short we make it out there but can't seat us because we don't have reservations and the wait for a table is an hour and a half. So we say \"Screw that!...what other spot can we eat!?\" So we just happen to come across Satay Asian Bistro and Bar. And I must say I've become truly enamored with the place. Once we entered we were quickly acknowledged and greeted. There is dim lighting and great decor. Sports was on the TV. The food here is a combination of Malay, Thai, and Singaporean dishes. Service was on point but the most importantly the food was delicious.\n\nWe ordered Thai beer...Singha...never had it before but enjoyed it. \n*Chicken satay stick\n* Pork satay stick\n* Honey glazed bbq pork\n* roast duck\n* steamed rice\n\nPortions were generous and reasonably priced.

Had the grilled calamari appetizer (very good) and the bacon wrapped scallops (typical Happy Hour fare) only average. I had the 1/2 roast duck and it was a huge portion, more than I could finish, the skin was soggy vs crispy, the way I prefer it. My son had the lamb curry, it was not seasoned great and a bit dry. My wife had the red curry tofu which was the best dish of the bunch. Maybe living in Northern CA I am spoiled, but I think it was average to just above average Thai food."

I would recommend it to all who would like to try something Ethnic and different, yet not very risque and not pricey at all.\n\nGirlfriend and I went to this place on a whim, and it was a pleasant surprise. It looks nice from the outside, but interior decor is rather run-of-the-mill with limited ethnic flavor to it, but not without reason. This place serves a mixture of Thai, Chinese and other Asian and Island flavors. You can be very tame and order a well known Chinese dish or try a more risque Malaysian dish, either way the food is cooked just right and the servers are very friendly and knowledgeable in recommending cuisine.\n\nThe place is large and is good for group meetings. The parking is pretty good for the location. The deserts are a bit lacking, but the ones that are present are good. The food is prepared quick and in good flavor, all is done right, albeit not spectacular. However, when the price tag is considered, this place is top notch! Lunch specials make it even better.\n\nDon't forget to visit this place next time you are in the \"Chinatown\" area of Las Vegas, you should be happy with the value for the money and your tummy will be satisfied as well."

            "review": "We were inside the restaurant on a Friday night. All the action was on the patio, with girls screaming every several minutes or so over the loud beats. The interior was dead when we arrived, save for 2-3 guys hanging out at the bar. We ordered thai iced coffee to start, which was good, but not phenomenal. \n\nThe interior is nice, with brick walls and well executed decorations. The bar is off the side from the main dining area, with the exit to the patio and bathrooms located on the opposite end from where we were seated. The party outside was really loud, and the music was even louder. They were playing largely hip hop and my boyfriend really didn't enjoy listening to it while trying to eat.\n\nFor food, we ordered the Buddha fresh spring roll, an order of the combo satay and the spicy red curry to finish. Our appetizers came out quickly, but not long after that that point another large group came in and they dominated the restaurant's attentions for the remainder of the evening. \n\nOur curry took at least 15, if not 20, minutes to come out while we sat and finished our coffees, our appetizers, and just sat there trying in vain to communicate over the really loud music. Our waitress had time to count her tips and chat with one of the other waitresses before everyone was distracted for the next 20 minutes. We ordered a Singha, which was forgotten, so after waiting a while we got it from another server who was rushing around.  We watched as a table of \"invisible customers\" a few seats down from us was filled with multiple different steaming plates of food while we were waiting on our curry. Eventually 2 people sat there, one who looked like they were probably the owner and the other his friend. The owner-looking fellow talked to the other group in the room & the waitstaff while ignoring us as we sat there unhappy.  \n\nThe Food:\nThe Buddha Fresh Spring roll was medicore. Small bites of shrimp with tons and tons of cabbage. No real texture interest, no real flavor of any kind- just lots of raw cabbage and chewy rice paper. Served with a really sticky, peanut-laced sauce. \n\nThe Satay were better. Several skewers of different types of meat, they were still tender and slid off the sticks easily enough to avoid puncturing yourself.\n\nAfter waiting so long, the curry didn't really satisfy us. It was definitely spicy, but didn't have much going on in the background. It was all heat in the beginning and wimper at the end. I liked the vibrant red color of it and the fresh herbs, but otherwise it was just OK. There wasn't a strong coconut flavor to it, which disappointed J quite a bit. We had been expecting more of a traditional thai style curry, while I'm guessing this may have been more Malaysian. I ate mine because I was hungry but J left his unfinished. \nWe had it with the coconut rice, which helped bring some coconut flavor to the picture, but not a ton. It was moist rice, but a small portion- roughly an upturned bowl for us to share. It was definitely not enough for the entire bowl and all the sauce.  \n\nWhen we were about to go, we asked to have all of our food boxed up. Our waitress disappeared with the food and then returned to go chat with the other customers. We stood around waiting until she was finished, but when that took too long, we asked another server where our food was. She'd thrown it away. Oh, thanks! It was easily half the meal still. I'm assuming she couldn't hear me because the music was SO loud!  We got another batch made up quickly, which made up for it- but also made us wonder why it took so long the first time. \n\nI don't like yelling over the music while trying to enjoy a nice meal out, nor do I enjoy being blatantly ignored or given biased treatment while out to eat. It's understandable to me that there's more motivation to kiss up to the large groups because of the higher chance of a good tip, but you never know in this town who'll be the best tipper. \n\nOverall- you're paying for atmosphere. Go at happy hour, grub out and drink some tasty sounding drinks. Don't go after midnight for food unless you're going to be partying on the patio or with a large enough group for them to really care."

I really enjoyed the peanut sauce that accompanied the chicken skewers. Also with it came cucumbers and onions in a sweet chili sauce, which was delightful. After grabbing a cold Singha, we got the Roti with a Thai curry dipping sauce. This dish reminded me of the street vendors in Chiang Mai. The roti bread seemed a little heavy, and the dipping sauce could have been thicker. However, it was still a good side as the curry flavor makes up for it. For our entree, we ordered Singapore noodles with chicken. These are thin vermacelli noodles. After we added some red Thai chillies the dish had the kick we desired. Over all a satisfying dinner, and the service was great! We would come back for happy hour."

There didn't seem like too much technique or preparation went into the dish.  It was tasty, meaty, and less than $15 for a half duck, which is considerably cheaper than most places, but the quality was not on par with an amazing duck experience that one would hope for.  I wouldn't mind coming back here as they have a few Malaysian menu items that most Thai places don't venture towards that seemed worth a try, but if you're strictly looking for Thai or an exceptionally well-made duck, then I would try China Town or more east in Las Vegas."

I went with the best sounding option they had which was the Rad Na, large flat noodles with vegetables. It didn't seem like it was going to be very exciting and it really wasn't. It didn't have any special flavor; however, it was very salty. I didn't even finish it, which is rare, because I'm a big eater who generally finishes things, especially when it's Thai food.

Laksa is unlike any curry you've ever tasted, its not as spicy and lemongrassy as a thai curry, its not a sour sort of acquired taste that is a japanese curry, its delicate, its buttery, and absolutely freaking delicious. \n\nThe Laksa here is hands down the tastiest Laksa I've ever had. It ruined me,  I cant eat it at any of the other local places I used to go to. \n\nYou can feel confident ordering from either the thai or malaysian side of the menu. I'm incredibly picky about my thai food; gratefully this place never dissapoints. My favorites aside from the Laksa are, the Roti with curry dipping sauce. The Roti is buttery and flaky like some kind of perfect biscuit/pancake hybrid, the dipping sauce is the same curry thats used in the laksa which I've already told you is delicious. The Thai Omelet with chicken is thin, crispy and never greasy, add a little sriracha and its just the way I like it! I also love their pad ki mao and the beef rendang; the sauce on the rendang will make your lips tingle just enough to make you sure you want more. When they ask what kind of rice you want make sure you say \"coconut\" and then make sure your friends do too, some fool always tries to order the brown rice and then ends up eating all your coconut rice.     \n\nThey have a full bar, a large lounge area, and patio outside for the smoking diners."

The price is cheaper as well to reflect this and to be completely honest, I think the portions are perfect for lunch size. The regular entree portion always equals leftovers for me.\n\n- Pad Thai 9/10\nI love the pad thai here. This is also offered as a lunch special, yay! Not much to say other than this restaurant's pad thai does not suck.\n\n\n- Pad See Ew 9/10\nAlso a great dish if you're a fan of flat rice noodles. This comes cooked w/ Chinese broccolli and your choice of meat. Not offered as a lunch special.\n\n\n- House salad 5/10\nNot a huge fan tbh. Sauce is okay and I like the touch with the egg, but I'm just not a huge fan of it. I do eat it all when I get it as a side with my lunch special but I would not order it. They offer this in a small and large size and honestly the small is a good portion.\n\n- Nasi Goreng 10/10\nI would consider this my absolute favorite dish from Satay! It's a fried rice dish -- which says a lot since I'm not a huge fan of fried rice -- with shrimp, squid, tofu with fried egg. Not sure what it is about this dish but I am a fan and would not hesitate to try it again! They only offer this as a dinner portion so it's fairly large.\n\nOverall, price point is a teeny bit higher than other local Thai restaurants, but their food does not disappoint!"

            "review": "I came here on one serendipitous evening when a group of us just finished watching some boxing at The Joint in the Hard Rock Casino and our hunger would not allow us to wait 45 minutes outside of Firefly.  Therefore we decided to walk across the street to check out Satay Thai.   Upon perusing the menu, I was a bit skeptical since there was a hodgepodge of pan-asian selections ranging from the standards (thai curries, chinese stir-frys, and malaysian/indonesian classics such as beef rendang and mee goreng) to the bizarre such as thai nachos (shrimp chips topped with ceviche) and \"chinese\" chicken which reminded me of  the Barenaked Ladies' song \"One Week\" (chickity china the chinese chicken?!) \n\nHowever, what jumped out at me since I almost never see it offered anywhere was the Curry Laksa.  If you have ever been to Singapore or seen a show devoted to the food hawkers there, you will no doubt recognize this is the dish to try and there are heated rivalries as to who makes the best version.  Essentially this is a fusion noodle soup from Chinese/Malay cuisine consisting of either thick egg noodles or thin vermicelli rice noodles in a spicy curry coconut broth simmered with chicken, seafood such as minced fish meatballs, and fried tofu.  Here they give you the best of both noodles so I didn't mind the juxtaposition in texture and flavors although they didn't necessarily add the sambal belechan chili paste made from chilis and dried shrimps giving it that trademark grittiness derived from it's namesake (Laksa in chinese means \"spicy sand\").  \n\nNonetheless on a cold wintery evening,  this rich, creamy, and spicy soup (they allow you to order the spice level from 1-10, I think 7 struck the perfect balance) gives you that cozy warm soup belly and the constant variation in flavors from all the individual components keeps every bite interesting down to the part where you are fishing for any final tasty remnants with your spoon.  The portion is substantial at a reasonable price ($9.95) and my parting advice is to be careful what you wear as you are slurping away.  At the end of my meal, I noticed a Jackson Pollock of curry on my dress shirt and I had to take it to the cleaners through two rounds to remove the stains, but it was worth the trouble since I would have otherwise missed out on this chance discovery."

We were starving so instead of driving somewhere else we decided to check out Satay, which is in the same plaza. It was kind of funny seeing how different Satay was compared to Firefly. Firefly was packed with people with plenty of others hoping and waiting to get seated. But over at Satay, we strolled right in and got seated immediately on the patio.\n\nThe siu mai ($4.95) was decent but forgettable. The roast duck appetizer ($8.95) was the best thing we ate. The skin was crispy and the meat was plentiful and savory. For my entree, I went with the honey BBQ pork ($12.95) which was a large mound of meat piled on top of some veggies. Most of the meat was tender, succulent and sweet, but if you get this plan on eating family style and sharing. It's pork overload, for sure.\n\nService was decent. Food was pretty good. I still would have preferred eating at Firefly if we could have gotten in, but Satay was a nice alternative."

Also, the eating area was very quiet, if your kid screams or fusses, everyone will literally turn their heads and the music will stop. \n\nOverall, I don't recommend this place for anyone taking their kids here.

I had one of those Satay skewer sticks with peanut sauce with their $2 side coconut rice. Yum. Pad thai was full of flavor! Not one that tastes more noodlish than flavorish. It had the good peanut taste with less of the noodle flavor. Also had the ragoons. And the thai flatbread with curry sauce for appetizer. If you're into appetizers that is plain bread with dipping sauce and you like the curry taste then I'd suggest to try it. It's pretty good I mean for $3 in happy hour not bad. But if you don't like plain tastes then I suggest you pass on it."

Their websites all had beautiful pictures of its many food items and I must admit I was hesitant at first to take any of the pictures seriously. Though I must say I was overly satisfied with everything this establishment had to offer.\n\nMost Thai restaurants in Las Vegas have beautiful d\u00e9cor which is always a pleasant sight when enjoying one's meal, and this restaurant was no exception. The restaurant was also connected to a Huka lounge and by the looks of it they play live music on certain nights.\n\nAs for the food it was decently priced, especially when you consider the marvelous food presentation, and exceptional natural taste of the foods. It felt and tasted as if every ingredient was naturally produced! Every item we ordered not only looked beautiful, but tasted just as great if not better. If you ever wanted a superb tasting strawberry lemonade, well try theirs you wont regret it!\n\nI don't quite remember my servers name but she was very sweet and so were the rest of the servers. It was also great to get a good night greeting from a man who i believe was the owner. Two thumbs up for that. It's been a long while since I've last been to a restaurant where I can honestly say I was already making plans in my head as to when I'd be returning. But Satay Thai managed that and more."

The name satay will always be synonymous with my parent's Indonesian heritage of go to dishes that's served along their killer bumbu satay (peanut sauce). So this place had a lot to live up to for me yet I will tread lightly as this is the only Malyasian establishment I know of in Vegas.\nThe setting is very modern and clean with ample seating. We were greeted & seated promptly by our friendly waitress.\nWe ordered appetizers to share and definitely wanted to try the roti canai which is a flatbread (similar to naan but greasier) and served with a curry dipping sauce. You must like curry to have this as the flavor is very intense. We enjoyed it but wish it was served with a little bit more of the flatbread to enjoy more than just a small portion of the strong curry sauce.\nNext was the Korean beef jerky which was ok. The beef had good marinated bbq flavor but was a bit more chewy and not as thinly sliced as I would have liked. It came with a tangy sauce I couldn't quite figure out. The Thai sticky rice was disappointing because we expected a more glutinous sticky rice to come out. The chicken satay was pretty good and well marinated. The peanut sauce did not taste like peanut sauce as the flavor was masked in something else. It was interesting. \nWe would come back to try some of the main dishes on the menu but my fear is that from my childhood going to another Indonesian family's house for dinner and it not measuring up to my mom's cooking...which I miss dearly.\nAt least you are doing it Satay Thai Bistro!"

The texture of the chicken is so pristine; it's crunchy with every bite you take. The chili sauce adds to the chicken to give it an immaculate taste.

I ordered their traditional won ton soup, but received their wor won ton soup (which includes lots of veggies, chicken, pork and shrimp in addition to the won ton). Broth was weak and flavorless, but the fresh veggies, shrimp, and won ton were very fresh tasting. Wish the carrots had been cooked just a bit more though. I am not a big fan of crunchy veggies in my soup. The won tons were wrapped separately, so I initially thought they forgot them entirely.  My mellow was harshed temporarily until my meal mate uncovered the m.i.a. wontons in a separate container, and my world was filled with sunshine once again.  Satay's wontons are wonderful!\n\nThe other entree we selected was the combination chow mein with fried noodles. Now these fried noodles are not your standard Chinese fast-food hard and pasty flavorless sticks ... These fried noodles are light as a feather, flavorful all by themselves, and added a wonderful texture dimension to the generous amounts of chicken, pork, shrimp and veggies.  A little on the dry side, as a noodle entree goes, but a dollop of my soup broth incorporated the ingredients well and resulted in a happy diner.\n\nMy favorite thing on their menu, thus far, is still their coconut rice. Delicately infused with coconut essence ... this rice makes an excellent side, and would go well with everything else on your plate. TRY THE COCONUT RICE!\n\nStill pricey at $40 for a large soup, combination chow mein, coconut rice, delivery fee and tip.  And not even a fortune cookie at the bottom of the bag. :("

The first time I went in with the hubby and five year old for Sunday afternoon lunch.  We were the only ones in there which I thought was a shame.  For all 3 of us, the bill was around $50, and we ate a ton and had adult beverages as well.  What a deal!  The weekend happy hour is extended...noon to six I think.  This beats an uptight brunch any day!  So, we had laksa, sweet chili chicken wings, roti, pork satay, and crispy duck...all good.  I wouldn't say the duck was actually crispy though, but it was still really good.  The satay was so flavorful and tender.  The wings were sweet, sticky, spicy, and wonderously crispy.  Roti was buttery and served with curry broth.  And the laksa, which I've been wanting to try, was a meal in itself (for 3).  I think it would make a great hangover remedy...warm and comforting and spicy.   I brought the girls here the following week.  We ordered all of the same stuff, plus calamari satay which was the best, extra orders of roti, and large amounts of wine. We sat on the patio even though it was over 100 degrees outside, but with the misters, it felt great.  It was a little busier this time around so the service was not quite up to par with the first visit.  They screwed up our bill a little bit and charged full price on some happy hour items, but it was all worked out in the end."

We ordered the Mongolian Beef, Lemongrass Chicken, chicken & shrimp fried rice, spring egg rolls, firecracker shrimp, bacon wrapped scallops, and seafood Tom Yum. Everything was delicious. But the highlight was definitely the seafood tom yum. Never had it or heard of it before, and it was delicious. We will definitely be fitting Satay into our next Vegas trip just for the Tom Yum."

And, I even heard another customer calling to place an order. Good phone etiquette is a sure sign of good service and it was. \n\nMy food was tasty, hot, and on time. Price was reasonable. Courteous service. Clean. Spacious. Plenty of parking. Can't ask for much more. \n\nI don't like to review the food specifically. My taste is unique from most. So, what I might say might be misunderstood. But, I can assure you that when everything is good like I explained that mostly whatever interests you will also be good. \n\nFurthermore, what might be good one day may not be good another. This is a business review, not a class on being a food judge. I have an extensive culinary background. I could pick apart the difference in how a raw tomato tastes. I'm not here to grade in detail about food. I'll let you be the judge in that. If I told you what to eat and you don't like it, I could jeopardize my reputation on the restaurants mistake.

Overall the food was very good and the service excellent.

I took a few bites before setting it aside. \n\nWhen my Pad Thai came out, it looked delicious! Unfortunately, it didn't taste as good as it looked. It was pretty dry and hard to chew, so I ended up adding in a few spoonfuls of my Tom Yum soup to break apart the noodles and make it easier to eat. Sad to say, I didn't finish this either nor take it home. \n\nThe server we had was nice though! He was both working at the bar and serving tables.

When our waiter approached us, he looked us and then his eyes widened as he spoke like either the light by the window was super bright or he was on something. That was a bit awkward. I've never had that reaction before. At least he was normal later on...\n\nI got the Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) with veggies and tofu and my cousin got the beef rendang. I tried a bit of his and thought it was alright. The portions for my Pad Kee Mao were huge and they had a nice wok heat, but I've never had tomatoes in that dish before and while I like tomatoes, I'm not sure I liked it in that dish. The tofu was overfried as it was brown and there weren't too many pieces. I've had better.\n\nI love how they have a huge selection of Malaysian, Singapore, and Thai food and nice pictures on their menu. Their menu was actually really nicely formatted, but otherwise, I am hesitant to rate this 4 stars. It was clean and quiet with good presentation and alright taste, but I didn't think it was the best. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could."

The waiter did not check on us after the food was served.  I believe his name was Daniel.  The checks got delivered without asking if we needed anything else.  It seemed that the waiter's phone required more attention.  We had to get the manager's attention to pick up the checks and bring a to-go container because we had to get back to the office.  For a lunch period, the speed of service is key.  I will need to think of this place twice as a lunch option."

            "review": "We decided to try the place out during restaurant week. A five course meal seemed like a good value, I love Thai food and it was for a good cause. It was a good decision.\n\nThe interior is somewhat appealing and the servers are polite. \nThe first course was the satay, one piece beef and one chicken. It was juicy sweet and not overcooked -- some of the best I've had outside of Thailand. \nNext was the papaya salad with shrimp. Even at a setting of 7/ 10 it was incredibly spicy-- exactly what I wanted. I ended up eating both of them because my girlfriend found hers too spicy. It was crunchy and had enough vegetables in it to stay interesting. \nThen came the tom yum kai -- a spicy sour red soup with chicken-- well known to any Thai food fan. The chicken was plentiful but the soup was a bit saltier than it should have been and the broth seemed a tad too thin. Still good but not up to the standards of the rest of the food. \nThen came the curry and rice. The rice was infused with coconut and was heavenly even when eaten plain. The curry was a thick classic red with duck. It was my first time trying duck in Thai curry and it wasn't bad at all. The meat was extra juicy and the spices in the curry more than adequate. \nAround that time came the pad thai-- which was honestly the best I've had outside Thailand. It had plenty of crumbled nuts tofu and vegetables and diced eggs in it to make it quite a memorable dish. Sweet with just the right amount of spicy. \nLastly of course was dessert-- fried banana garnished with vanilla ice cream. Quite a hit with my girlfriend. I left feeling pretty satisfied about the meal and its cost. It's hard to stand out in such a saturated market but this place is worth trying for Thai fans in Vegas."

You could taste the basil and if you like spice, dip your fries in the chili sauce. The vegan egg rolls were nice and crispy as well and not mushy. You could readily identify every vegetable in the roll and it also paired well with either the sauce it came with or the chili sauce. Although I do not eat meat, my friends got the chili chicken wings and they smelled amazing.\n\nOn my second visit, I tried the curry samosas and the flavor was a savory blend of curry, potatoes, onions, and carrots. I am not sure what the chutney dip was that's served with this, but it was sweet and I definitely used all of it. I also shared the Pad Woon Sen with my friend and we had it made with tofu and it was just the right amount if you are sharing and getting an appetizer. The best part of the entire meal was the dessert! I am normally not a big fan of mango any other way than freshly sliced...until I tried the mango sticky rice. The mango, sauce, and sticky rice was delicious and was a light finish to a great meal."

But the waitress are so nice, she said that she will stay open for another 30 minutes if I want to eat there. My fiancee want to eat there.\n\nI hate being a last customer in the restaurant, seriously, I know how sucks it is.

Anyway, we ordered laksa and char gway teow. OMG. Those item are to die for. I absolutely clean the plates although I dont clear the soup cos its too much curry and fat. But the dish are delicious and we get in and out in 20 minutes. \n\nThank you satay thai bistro for staying open for us and for providing good service. WE are forever your loyal patron.

Although the beginning of our experience was poor, the food really made up for it.  \n\nMy friend and I stopped in for dinner a little later than  the normal dinner rush hours and to our delight the place was relatively quiet and had quite a few open tables.  The host said we would be seated in just a few minutes but it took at least 10. I didn't really understand why because there were plenty of available tables and we were the only ones waiting.  They seemed to be a little understaffed so that may have had something to do with it.  Regardless we were finally seated. \n\nThe experience continued to go downhill as the server took forever to take our drink order and forever to bring our drinks.  And yes,  also forever to take our food order and bring our food. \n\nNormally this would automatically mean a 2 or 3 star review from me,  as service really makes an experience,  but their food is so delicious I'm letting it slide.  We had strawberry lemonade,  which isn't lemonade at all in the sense of having lemons or lemon flavor in it. It was that they used strawberries as the ingredient instead of lemons and made a drink from that.  It was delicious and came with a big straw to get the chunks of fresh strawberry out. \n\nAs far as food,  i had the glass noodle stir fry with chicken and my friend had the Thai fried rice with beef. Both dishes were seriously A+,  some of the best Thai I've ever had.  Really huge portions and a superb price point,  especially for Vegas. \n\nI'll be back...

We also enjoyed Singha beer towers (those things are enormous!)  I had to rely on Bobby's beer \"pouring\" skills for a full glass.  I also tried an Asian pear/sake cocktail with a cucumber (delicious).  Misti Y. named a cocktail the \"Yelpish Red\" and it was enjoyed by all.\n\nSatay really set us up with a good deal - their happy hour is $3 appetizers, $3 house wines, $5 martinis and tropical cocktails/Yelpish Red Special drink, $24 beer towers, etc.  Our bartender was awesome and he set up Santana on a giant sound system outside.  Jay-son who I believe owns/manages Satay checked on us, mingled, and gave us all coupons for our next visit.\n\nI had a great time and definitely would return to check out the rest of the menu.

The sauce is perfect. The tofu is at a perfect consistency and the fried outside is super flavorful. I would prefer if they threw in more tofu though. We went there last night and I think they put in a total of 3 small tofu pieces. Really?\n\n2) Curry Laksa--So yummy! So decadent! This is a must-try! We always feel guilty eating it though, 'cause all that flavor and deliciousness can't possibly be good for us. Guilty pleasure :)\n\n3) Roti Canai--The curry that comes with it is phenomenal. I would prefer the roti bread less oily and thinner/crispier. Tastes great nonetheless!\n\nWe have tried other dishes as well, but I can't remember what they were. I just remember we've never had a mediocre experience there. Consistency is very important to us. I'll be sure to update this review if we order anything else on our next visit.\n\nWe usually split an order of 1 entree, a side dish, and a bowl of rice. They have good-sized portions so that's perfect for us. Our total bill comes out between $25-$30, including tip/tax. \n\nTIP: If you like spicy, ask for their tray of assorted spicy chilis!

I love the Singapore fried noodles. Probably because they're vermicelli noodles and that's my fave. Chicken satay is great. Papaya salad is good, can be a too spicy for some. Panang curry was tasty. Pretty standard thai food menu. Pad prik khing has good flavor but they cut the lemon grass into small pieces but they were still too big to take down. I would ask them to hold the lemon grass next time  \n\nMy absolute favorite is the crab Rangoon. Omg fried imitation crab and cream cheese. So good. So bad for your thighs. But so worth it. \n\nThey have a frequent diner card. I've already scored $10 towards my bill."

Amazing creaminess and spice that doesn't burn you but just heats you up the right way.  Also a great happy hour from either 4 or 430 to 7 with good beer, wine, and cocktail discounts (specialty drinks are down from $9 to like $5).  Five stars all the way from me."

Very tender and you didn't have to wrestle them off the skewers. Very tasty and tender, great seasoning and you can't do wrong with peanut sauce. The roti, as recommended by my bartender-server, was also tasty with the curry sauce dip (but also great with the peanut sauce from the satay). I've had roti before and loved it. Its almost pastry-like, crisply multi-layered like greek phyllo but more stretchy. This particular one was more greasy than I would like. I'll ask for that adjustment next time and it should be perfect. Its almost like the Malay version of chips and salsa. I caught the chef spying on me from the kitchen to make sure I liked his food. That was pretty cute. Haha. \n\nLooks like they have a cool lounge scene for evenings, too. Comphy modern low couches set up in a very social layout. Totally chill-worthy. \n\nI'll be back for sure.

There were 3 cucumbers that provided some palate-cleansing between bites of meatiness, but it didn't last long. He said they're mostly for garnishment and this is how Beef Rendang is traditionally.

This place was a pleasant 10 min walk from our hotel. When I was reading the reviews here on Yelp, I was a bit annoyed when people described this place as Thai as it was obvious from the menu choices that it was a fusion between Thai and Malaysian (sorry I'm a proud Malaysian foodie). \n\nAs described by many people, this place was really quiet when we walked in with only 1 other older couple. But I was happy that more people came after us. There was a family and a couple that came in (obviously regulars) because they already knew what they wanted. \n\nOverall service was good but I felt one of the servers wasn't genuinely nice. She seemed a bit impatient with us but was super friendly to the family. \n\nThe food.... Oh my! DELICIOUS! And the portions were generous. I ordered the Curry Laksa which I'm happy to note is authentically Malaysian and my husband ordered a Thai glass noodles. I forgot the name. His dish was yummy too! Just thinking about the food right now is making my mouth water. The curry was thick and packs a punch flavour-wise. And the best surprise of all, they had sambal belacan (a sort of chili salsa). All the flavours  of home.... If we had found this place earlier, I would've come here every day!\n\nOur 2 dishes plus tips came to USD 25. So the prices were reasonable too. So worth it."

Aforementioned, the service and its perception has declined and we have been the recipients of the outcome.\n\nAfter giving proper chances and observations, It is not a habit to patronize such businesses that continue to fail us as very \"easy\" customers.  One might ask how easy a customer I (we) are/am when I write such reviews.  \n\nA review is the recapping of an event in the perception of the one reviewer.  You in your reply did question my accuracy which is your right.  It is our right to avoid businesses that excuse with image-saving tactics rather than in two sentences express regret and ask how to fix the issue. \n\nYour wish to invite us for diner on you is appreciated and will be considered.\n\nIn response; 8/18/2016 , one star for your rhetorical response.\n\nYou question my review and its accuracy?  To question a quantitative and qualitative researcher is absurd.  To question a once loyal customer is out of the question.  I believe you and a female worker were eating dinner at the table towards the front door that evening this happened.\n\nYour service has declined severely since we started patronizing you.  Two of your staff know my family well as we always order the same thing.  Needless to write, you were given several chances and that night was the last straw.\n\nThat party was not at the bar and received full meals.  The appetizer excuse works on the unaware.  Next, the other couple came in way after us but received service (food) first.  \n\nThe problem is, When a person or business is asked to be responsible, they shift responsibility so I thank places like Yelp that give a voice to those like myself and my wife who are international.  \n\nThe food there is good and my vegan friends began enjoying your cuisine however, they follow our recommendations.  \n\nInstead of letting us walk out that night because you were made aware of our wait, you should have apologized, and made it right."

However, it did enter my radar when browsing through restaurants participating in restaurant week.  I was intrigued by the prix fixe five course menu priced at $30.11 per person.  \n\nWe arrived on Tuesday night around 8:30PM.  The restaurant was at about 40% capacity, not too busy.  We were greeted right away and seated.  Our waitress greeted us with a smile.  I have to say she was very sweet.  We decided to order from their regular menu as opposed to the prix fixe menu which would have cost $30/pp.  \n\nNow on to the food!  We started off with the Thai nachos.  These are fried shrimp chips topped with a mango and shrimp ceviche.  The flavor was awesome.  The ceviche was a mix of bell peppers, mango, and shrimp.  All of these ingredients were very fresh.  I have to say, though, that there was not enough shrimp.  The amount of bell pepper and mango far outweighed the amount of shrimp.  I wish there was more shrimp!  It would have been a five star dish. \n\nNext we had chicken and steak satay.  This is basically meat on a skewer.  It came with 2 chicken skewers and 2 steak skewers, which was perfect for two people.  The peanut dipping sauce was a bit sweet which went well with the salty meat.  We also ordered the thai duck curry with coconut rice.  First of all, I love that they give a choice in rice.  They offer jasmine, brown, or coconut rice.  Love it!  The coconut rice was really good too.  I don't usually order duck, but we were feeling adventurous.  To be honest, I wish I would have ordered chicken.  It wasn't bad, but I know now that I'm not a fan of duck.  The main reason this isn't a five star review is because of the spice level in the curry.  We ordered a six on a scale of 1-10 and it was more like a two.  It wasn't spicy at all, and that was disappointing.  This will not deter me from coming back, though.  Next time I'll just specify that this white girl needs a bit of heat!\n\nFinally we had 2 orders of coconut sorbet priced at $3 each.  This was a refreshing way to end the meal.  The sorbet was creamy and flavorful.  It was a generous serving too.  Me and the girlfriend could have easily shared one and been satisfied.  I'm glad we didn't though!\n\nAll of this food plus a Thai iced tea and the bill came to around $40.00.  I was full and happy and it didn't break the bank too much.  I really really like this place.  They have a lot of variety on the menu for food and drink, the service is friendly, and it's fairly priced.  I'm a fan!"

The place has a cool, laid-back vibe to it, and the service/people were really welcoming and friendly... we even learned a little bit of Thai while waiting for our food. The place seems to draw a steady group of regulars, but we (the tourists) didn't feel out-of-place.\n\nPlenty of outdoor/indoor seating with a cool little lounge area on the back wall, as well as a large bar. This would be a great spot for a large group of friends or a little party - and the menu definitely has something for everyone. The happy hour specials were a great deal - with higher-end cocktails topping out the price list at $5 . On a hot afternoon, the \"sawa-tea\" is really smooth and refreshing (but still packs a punch). I also saw they had a ton of non-alcoholic drinks, too... just didn't really sample those. \n\nWe ordered the roti canai, the crab rangoon, the beef rendang, and the mee goreng. Our waiter, Noel, recommended 3/4 of the above and we couldn't have been more satisfied with our order. The beef was savory and delicious, with a nice balance of spices, and the mee goreng was just a little bit spicy and sweet without being too sugary/saccarine  - I recommend getting the chicken/shrimp add-on, if that's your thing - but even if it isn't, the dish comes with perfectly pan-fried tofu glazed in the dish's signature sauce. All the accompanying sauces were really really good (especially the sauce that comes with the roti canai... I could literally drink this stuff, but I recommend pouring it on the rice!).\n\nEven though we were both starving, we had plenty of food to take home with us at the end of the meal.\n\nWe'll definitely be back next time we're in Vegas for happy hour/lunch/dinner."

Two of the times they messed up on the heat but that's ok because I'm not a fan of spicy food. I came here 3 times and each time I got the pad see ew. So delicious. My kids got the pad Thai and another noodle dish that I can't remember the name and they were both just as delicious. I also order the lettuce wrap. The lettuce was on the small side and made it hard to eat but the meat itself was good. Staff is super friendly and service was excellent."

They make an actual mojito that they make right, not like you'll find on the main part of the strip. I started off with scallops wrapped in bacon. Crispy bacon, with the chewy scallop after taste, can't go wrong with this appetizer. Main course I ordered red curry, which was as good as i ever had it. Mango w/ sticky rice to top it off, overall nothing short of amazing. Have you try this place"

It attracts lots of different types of people, young and older, dimly lit, and they even have a lounge area with a TV.\n\nThey serve hookah during the evenings and it's pretty decent priced. I think around $15. However, during the weekends it gets extremely busy (I waited an hour for a group of 3 people). They did not have a waiting system established either. \n\nNow the food is really good and their menu is extensive. I believe they mix-in Chinese food options, but do not quote me on this. They also give you options of Tofu & Veggie, Chicken, Beef, Pork for each menu item (how amazing is that!). They also have white rice, coconut rice, and brown rice options. Here are my favorites menu items:\n\nSingapore fried noodles with Tofu: slightly crispy, thin version of Chow Mien. Delicious!\nPad Prik Khing (any meat, I have yet to try the Tofu version): Crispy green beans in a oily-spicy sauce with your choice of meat!\nThai Style Rice: Extremely sticky patty of rice, very good when served warm (it stays soft for a bit).\nVeggie Delight: Mixed vegetables and tofu in a light soy sauce gravy. Add a little Sriracha and there is no sacrifice for choosing the healthy option!"

We should've taken it as a sign to go somewhere else, but I insisted as reviews on Yelp were good...\n\nWe had wanted to get the veggie tofu soup in a hot pot, but the waitress refused saying they only have the hot pot for the Thai hot and sour soup, not accommodating at all. \n\nDRINKS: The Thai iced tea is way too syrupy sweet as previous Yelper had mentioned.  Coconut juice was not very fresh and a tad sour. \n\nAPPETIZERS: For a restaurant named Satay, the chicken satay is extremely DISAPPOINTING as the chicken was DRY and BURNT. The cucumbers looked like they have been pickled too long and turned color. When I mentioned that chicken satay was dry, waitress says it's because they use white meat. I've had white meat chicken before, and it's definitely not dry if you know how to cook it. The only good dish was the Roti bread, but you can also get a tasty one at Big Wong. \n\nENTREES: Chicken Laksa was not very flavorful just spicy. The chicken in there was also extremely tough and dry. Waitress again said it's because it's white meat and that our taste must be different since we are from LA! What kind of excuse is that?! \n\nAll the chicken were way too dry and chef special eggplants was oily and served lukewarm. The coconut rice is just ok nothing amazing. Something must've changed at this place because it is definitely NOT a 4 stars rating. \n\nI had wanted to like this family restaurant, but the food is mediocre at best, and the staff does not care enough about customer satisfaction. Even though staff was courteous and brought water when needed, the repetitive excuses for bad tasting food says a lot about this restaurant in a strip mall."

Our large group was seated immediately.  \n\nWe were all very impressed by the menu.  They have a TON of options, and lots of pictures to see what many of the dishes look like.  I ordered a taro root boba smoothie, and a green curry with coconut rice.  Their spicy-meter goes from 1-10, and our server told us that it starts to get very spicy at 7.  My dish was spicy, but I like a lot of spice, so our server brought some additional sauces for us, which some of us did end up using.  My smoothie was delicious - nice and smooth with great flavor.  My curry dish was also excellent, and I really like the cocount rice.  I am not used to seeing that on menus, but it was recommended by our server.\n\nAll in all, everyone at our table was happy with their meals.  The portion size was perfect.  We were all staying at a hotel, so we didn't want leftovers.  The portion size was good and filling, without excess.\n\nThis place is definitely worth a visit, and I would go back the next time I'm visiting Vegas."

Extremely disappointed, as they were the item I was most excited about. They weren't even decent fries, they were overly greasy, limp, and unseasoned.\nFRESH BUDDHA ROLLS are giant spring rolls wrapped in rice paper, good value at $5, add shrimp for a dollar more otherwise this is a pointless order.  Majority of filling is browning iceberg lettuce with some basil. Confused about why the order comes with such a miniscule amount of peanut sauce- the cup was literally less than a third full. Not worth getting without adding the shrimp\nSALT AND PEPPER SHRIMP: Shrimp did not seem the freshest, no salt and pepper present in the order. Shrimp seemed leftover and reheated with mushy breading, a few sliced fresh jalapenos were thrown on top. \n\nTossed 2 of the 3 items I ordered. Probably would not come back. I suggest going during HH if you simply have to try it out for yourself."

It's a blessing that it showed up on the search results because I have also been looking for a decent place near my home that sells good curry. Satay met all those criteria.\n\nAs far as food goes, their menu is extensive. They serve Malaysian, Chinese, and Thai dishes. The menu has pictures of each dish and details whether dishes are vegetarian or gluten free. The drink selection is also great. \n\nI ordered the yellow curry with chicken breast and a side of jasmine rice. Everything was served hot and fresh. The curry was sweet with a tinge of spiciness: just the way I like it. My husband ordered the curry laksa: noodles, chicken, fish, and veggies in a spicy curry broth. He enjoyed it, but it was on the spicier side. His stomach bothered him for a little while after dinner. I personally recommend getting a side of rice with the curry laksa to tone done the spiciness. For an appetizer, we ordered garlic basil fries. Delicious. My husband and I both agree that the food here is different than we can get anywhere in our proximity and everything tasted excellent. If you're looking for something new, go here!\n\nI also wanted to make a note about the atmosphere of this restaurant. They had an active fire pit outside that is warm and welcoming. It was unexpected. The warm and welcoming feeling extends to the inside with the dim lights and music selection. This place is great for families and dates alike. The service was also fast and friendly. The staff was really on top of filling our drinks and checking up on us. That's always a plus.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with Satay.

The food was mediocre as a whole. The bacon scallops came 2 on each skewer and there were 6 total for $9. The bacon wasn't cooked enough in my opinion and the scallops were small and definitely frozen.  My curry was kind of the same story. For Thai, I felt it was a bit bland and didn't have much of a strong curry flavor even though it looked and had the consistency of a typical thai curry dish.  Neither of these dishs were good enough for me to order again, so I won't be coming back.

It has a slightly sweet flavor goes well as an appetizer or paired with the combination fried rice.\n\nBacon Wrapped Scallops - Bacon. Scallops.  BACON!!!!\n\nBeef Rendang - Its a curried type beef, but what makes it amazing is that it's short rib. Short rib, marinaded and slow cooked with tons of flavor.  Apparently you can order it spicy, but I hate all things spice (I'm convinced spicy things undermine my taste-bud's ability to appreciate beef).\n\nCombination Fried Rice - Chicken, bbq pork, shrimp, egg.  Perfect balance of saltiness with flavors.  \n\nLemongrass Chicken - I believe it's roasted chicken. Lemongrass with a slight sweetness\n\nGarlic Green Beans - Garlic, green beans, butter, garlic.\n\nOn a gluttony day, I order all of the above and make 1.5 meals out of it."

The location is just near Caesars Palace and MGM were we stayed. \n\nAfter walking in there is a nice bar towards the back and plenty of open seating areas. It's definitely above average. The waiter was nice and service was good. \n\nI ordered the Laksa noodles, small plates of duck and Thai beef jerky. My son had the lemongrass grilled chicken. Everything was excellent. This is by far my second favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. It's my favorite for serving Laksa. The beef jerky was great too.  It wasn't hard and chewy but just soft and lean with a little crisp. The dipping sauce was very good. The lemongrass chicken dish was very good too. Nice marinade and grill to it. \n\nWhen and if in Vegas again I will return to this place for some awesome Laksa."

I was able to revisit Satay for my CM \"coming out,\" but this update is strictly about the yummy Asian happy hour treats I ingested. Singha beer: delicious, and the beer towers are quite effective at keeping that stuff cold, especially when you have stellar servers bringing out the cold mugs. Some of those new stars definitely reflect my joy at being able to order a  beer tower! As for the happy hour food, at $3 a plate, this is one good deal. I could feed a whole Yelp battalion for that price, and I did. The spring rolls, samosa bites and edamame were my favorites: delicious and served piping hot. Now, the chicken wings are not on the happy hour menu, but I definitely recommend getting them. They are fat little things fried-up perfectly and served with a finger-licking sweet and spicy sauce. Whoever they have on the fryer has mastered it quite well. Oh, and the satay are yum-azing. Sometimes satay skewers are dry and stubbornly cling to the stick, but not these. They are juicy and come right off. \n\nAdd all of this up and serve it on a patio, and you have a new must-try happy hour spot. I know it is tempting to just roll up to Firefly, but isn't it time you tried something new?"

Being adventurous, we asked for recommendations from the waitress.  \n\nShe ordered for us the Nasi Lemak Satay Special which came with 2 chicken satay (which were tasty), a beef item (good), a pile of dried/deep fried small fish, and fried bananas (the batter was a bit much).  She also got us a Mee Goreng noodle dish which I thought was very tasty.  Loved the Malaysian Chicken Curry.

Christmas dinner is usually a pain in the ass and requires lots of calling around to see what poor people are working on christmas. Usually we get Chinese or pizza but since we were in vegas we decided to call a few more places than we normally do. \n\nSatay happened to be open and allowed us to reserve a seat. The waitress was the best and funny and engaging. We got: chicken breast pad thai, pork pad see ew, chicken satay, half a roasted duck, and thai basil beef. \n\nChicken Satay- the whole family loves peanut sauce so the thing was gone in seconds. The portion was a little small though for the price. \n\nChicken pad thai- the best dish we ordered. It was just the perfect amount of everything. They use these huge bowls that make it look like there isn't much food but it's more than enough. My dad who doesn't usually like pad thai ended up really digging the dish. \n\nPork pad see ew- this was yummy as well and i'm glad I was able to convince my mom to get it. I'm glad it wasn't my main dish though since I don't like chinese broccoli\n\nHalf a roasted duck- huge portion for just $15! I don't like duck but my sister really enjoyed it. The coconut flavored jasmine rice that came with it was pretty good as well. \n\nThai basil beef- this was the most disappointing dish. We had pretty high hopes for it but there just wasn't enough umph to it.  It was just salty and the taste of the basil didn't come through. \n\nFor desert we got mango sticky rice because both my sister and mom had never had it before. The coconut sauce they used was a little bit salty but it made it even more delicious. I really need to work on perfecting my own recipe because I feel really guilty every time I spend $8 for some rice and mangos. \n\nAll in all we had a wonderful time. They are doing a promotion on their gift cards where if you bought $50 worth of gift cards you got an additional $15 for free. If we were in Vegas for longer than 2 days we would've bought them and gone one again but there are too many other things to eat!"

Initially we were going to the tapas restaurant across the parking lot, but that place was packed so we decided to go for Thai (which was fine because we're all Thai food lovers). When we got here there was a party of about 20 that had just been seated. After waiting forty five minutes for a table (when the place was not even packed) we seated ourselves because the staff were too busy to seat us? We sat at a dirty table that had not been bused so I asked the buser to bus the table. He was very polite and customer oriented. \nOur waitress then came over and took our order. After that we did not see or hear from our server for litteraly ONE HOUR. After growing impatient, I finally got the attention of our busser, and explained to him that I knew that he was not our server and I have worked in a restaurant before, so I was wondering why we haven't been served in over an hour, and he politely got the manager. The manager came over and said that \"it was busy\" when there were only 3 other tables there, and one had a party of 20, but still... customer service was really lacking.. If they were that busy back there, they should have made up with good customer service, which they definitly lacked! There were 5 of us at our dinner, and we each ordered our own dish, yet each dish came out litterally 30 minutes apart from each other.... It was really odd.. Anyway at the end of all this, the manager obviously knew that he was at fault so he offered us a free dessert (for all five of us to share). He did not offer to give a discount on the food. \nWe were litteraly in the restaurant for 3 and a half hours. Waiting. It was ridiculous. \nThe food was great, but it was definitly not worth the wait or the horrible customer service. \n\nMy thoughts: should've just waited at the tapas restauraunt"

The tom yum soup was lacking in flavor.  I added lime to it and still didn't amount to much.  The pad thai was nothing to write about...so that is all she wrote.  \n\nOk, there's more.  The wait to get my check took awhile.  I gave them my credit card.  They said sorry but our machine is down, can you pay cash? I said no, I didn't have cash on me.  They said ok we will imprint it the old-school way.  Fine, do what you need.  The imprinted receipt came back to me.  They pointed to where I can put in the tip.  Hmmm...\n\nOf course I tipped!  But to point that out...really??"

They try to do Malaysian, Thai, and Chinese, but it just makes everything strange. The BBQ pork I ordered last time was super sweet, I didn't even need a dessert after. Also, I think everything is overpriced. You can get better food for lower price somewhere else."

Thank you for making our last meal in Vegas for this trip so excellent!  I will be back next time I'm in town."

            "review": "Came for the lunch special today, 1pm 2 Mar 2016.  Ambiance was good nice and casual and not crowded the usual hipster music.\n-Drink, Strawberry Smoothie w/ boba great enough said.\n-Salad was crisp with a good dressing.  Negatives, it had a single brown leaf so happens and a little too much dressing but still tasty.\n-Honey BBQ pork, thinly sliced pork with grill marks and slight burnt edges so a true grilled delight.  The sauce was good.  Negatives, slightly dry and a little fatty but still good.\n-Pad Pak Ruam (veggie delight) w/Chicken, two kinds of mushrooms, chilli peppers, carrots, cabbage, celery, zucchini, broccoli and leaks.  I got the 4 spicy so it had a decent kick but not over powering.  Definitely taste the garlic which I like.  \n-Negatives, The veggies were not cooked evenly so broccoli was ala dente but leaks/cabbage was over cooked.  Chicken was dry so had to use the sauce and drink to help it down.  \n\n-Overall this is a good lunch destination for a quick bite to eat and not feel rushed.  I would come back just not an everyday venue.  FYI they do a military discount 10% for those staying close by.  The BBQ pork was the best so far."

            "review": "I've eaten here several times, but my spouse has lunch here at least once a week. When we eat at Satay, my spouse knows what I like so I never have to place the order myself. Weirdly enough, I like that. Even though they are in English, Asian restaurant menus seem a bit foreign to me. I like trying new things so every time I come, I have a new experience on my plate. \n\nMy favorite things about this restaurant is that I've never had a bad meal and you can identify the owner. She knows her regulars, interacts with the customers and aims to please... and that makes a big difference."
