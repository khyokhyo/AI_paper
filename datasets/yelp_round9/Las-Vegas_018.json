A bit underwhelming for being an Emeril restaurant, but an accessible option that can easily accommodate large groups.\n\nFriend really enjoyed her Colorado filet mignon, which came out beautifully, paired with spinach and potato puree, served with a red wine sauce. \n\nWasn't impressed with the kobe beef shortrib - beef was semi-grade and surprisingly tough. Served with sauteed spring vegetables and potato puree. \n\nService was friendly enough and attentive. Restaurant was surprisingly empty on a Thursday evening."

I've eaten at his places in New Orleans and loved them so I had high hopes.\n\nOverall, they were pretty much met.  I really enjoyed the chicken and sausage gumbo. I miss those flavors.  I had the tuna with brussel sprouts dish which was really unlike some other dishes I've had. My only issue is that the temperature of the dish seemed lukewarm. I get that the fish is only seared but the temperature seemed off to me. However, I warmly acknowledge that could be me and it didn't stop me from nearly licking my plate clean.\n\nMy dining companions enjoyed everything that had as well. We got some nice happy hour drinks to compliment things and they got us out super quick (which is what we asked). Service was professional if a bit distant.  Prices are typical for vegas without it being outrageous. \n\nIn any event, would come back here again."

It was absolutely incredible)\n-lobster rolls (they were okay....not typical lobster rolls but they tasted good)\n-lobster gnocci. The description was a little deceptive. It's regular gnocci with loster bits sprinkled in at the bottom of the plate. To be fair, the lobster pieces were pretty large and it tasted rich and hearty.\n\nWe would try it again but I'd probably opt for Grimaldi's next door. It's a quicker bite and it's more affordable"

            "review": "Not sure why all the negative reviews, Table 10 was so good we actually booked it for a second night. Our initial dinner was with our team from the tradeshow. We made reservations ahead of time and were seated right upon arrival. Service was great, food was really good, and the prices are totally reasonable for Vegas standards. Pretty much the same results for our second dinner with clients. Between the two visits, I tried the steak frites, the bone marrow, the squid, and the fish entree. Each and everyone was delicious with the steak frites being possibly one of the best I have ever had. Just thinking about the juicy fries sitting under the steak is making me hungry now!"

Party of 6 - we sat at a round table, better than long table because everyone can talk to each other and see everyone.  This restaurant also had a deal at tix4tonight booths so even though this place was pricy it came out very reasonable!  The food was amazing- everyone must try the truffle mac and cheese!  The portions are large, great place for having family style if you are with close friends.  We ordered the  bone marrow because of the rave reviews here and my boyfriend raved about it.  I tried it for the sake of trying something new, but I wouldn't order it again just because I felt like I was eating a heart attack.  It had a fatty, buttery texture that I was not used to.  I would definitely come back."

I recommend the bacon appetizer, though I think it's changed in the last year and was not as big/hick as I recall.  Still has great flavor.  Steaks are very good.  Service was accomplished by a number of people which made things go smoothly.  Prices are decent for a celebrity chef in a nicer strip hotel."

Hubs says this is his favorite beef filet ever and if we ever go back to Vegas he doesn't know if he could do another steak place!!!\n\nNot sure if the chef tasting menu changes, but our waiter gave us great wine pairing recommendations.  If you have the banana cream pie, I WOULD opt for the extra cost wine pairing for that one!  If you have the carrot cake, it so sweet it doesn't need the dessert wine!!  Our waiter recommended accordingly, but the hubs an i were sharing the desserts so we got to test this out!!  :)"

They nicely seated us right away even though we were late for our reservation. Thanks to FourSquare (and this app too) we each earned a free red or while Sangria. It was missing the usual glass full of fruit, but it tasted like a Sangria. I got the crab salad to start. I've had lots of crab meals around town but this one tasted a bit fishy. It was good though and about a cup of it came in the serving. My entree however was amazing. I ordered a filet (8oz) medium well. It came butterflied and was cooked perfectly in all portions. The taste of the wood fire was wonderful! Good service and l really loved that steak."

I would come back to try the other dishes when I can. \nThe restaurant is located in the Palazzo Hotel, on the 2nd floor."

            "review": "Our party of 10 dined at Table 10 at the Palazzo Hotel this past Saturday night.\n\nFirst of all, the food was excellent.  Everyone at the table ordered something different, and we all got to sample each other's dishes.  Fish entrees were cooked perfectly, not dry at all, even including the lean halibut.  I ordered the rotisserie-grilled duck and not only was it delicious, the portion was surprisingly big (thigh and leg).  Highly recommended.\n\nWhy this restaurant ended up with 2 stars from me, however, was because of the service and other little things.  Let's start with the terrible service.  It started off fine, but unfortunately, after the waitress took our order and brought us our drinks, she disappeared for a solid 20 minutes.  She did come by after that to bring steak knives and take away salad forks and spoons as she \"prepared us for the food.\"\n\nHowever another 10 minutes passed, and now everyone's wondering where our food was.  One of our diners asked the waitress politely if our food was coming out soon, she told him rudely \"it's only been 30 minutes.\"  Sorry for wondering where our food was.  The restaurant was almost empty.  I think we saw maybe 2 other tables that were seated and waiting for food.\n\nOur food didn't come out for another 10 minutes.  This timeline is by my best estimation.  Let's put it this way.  We were seated at 8pm, and we didn't receive our food until 9:15pm.  \n\nLike I said, the food was delicious, though certainly not worth the wait.\n\nOur drinks went un-refilled.  We had to flag our waitress down to ask for refills.  She also did not bother to come back and check on us.  Our waitress's attitude stunk, to say the least, and ruined the dining experience.  What did we do wrong other than to ask where our food was after 30 minutes by her own admission.  There were no apologies, no \"thank you for waiting\", nothing.\n\nAnother criticism is the bread.  We were handed out dinner rolls that looked out of place at a higher-end restaurant.  Dinner rolls?  Really?  And they didn't look/taste like they were freshly baked.  They looked like supermarket-bought rolls.  Very disappointing.\n\nIt's a shame that such a great restaurant is ruined by poor service."

            "review": "Table 10 was definitely \"OK.\"  We wouldn't go there again, but don't regret going there once.\n\n(Do not go to this restaurant with the expectation that \"It's Emeril so it must be great.\"  Emeril isn't actually the one cooking.  Unfortunately.)\n\nService and ambiance were good.\n\nMy wife and I each ordered the Pick-4.  For the first course, I ordered the BBQ shrimp, which were undercooked and had an unpleasant taint to the flavor.  (Sort of a gritty, dirty taste.)  My wife had the tomato salad.  She liked it.\n\nFor the second course, I had the gumbo, which was quite good.  It made me happy I tried it, but didn't make me want to get it again in the future.  My wife had the candied bacon.  It was excellent.  But then again, it was bacon.  How could it not be excellent?  Even still, you should definitely get the bacon if you come here.\n\nFor the third course, I had the chicken.  It was a bit overcooked and dry, but was otherwise fine chicken. My wife had the filet, which she had ordered medium and which came out rare.  The crust was overly charred.  Between the excess char and the rare inside, my wife only ate about half her steak.  (I tried a bite, and I probably would have sent it back.  My wife was more forgiving.)\n\nDessert was very good.  I had the banana cream pie, which was outstanding.  My wife had the dense chocolate cake, which she liked.  But she did end up eating more of my banana cream pie than her chocolate cake, and she's a chocolate freak, so that tells you something.\n\nOverall, it was a nice dinner, and the price was fine for two solid four-course meals.  A couple elements were spectacular, several were fine, and a couple were quite disappointing.  If your expectations aren't too high, you'll have a pleasant dinner at Table 10."

            "review": "I was in Las Vegas for a company trip (haha, pretty awesome) and decided to go to Palazzo to check out what they had going on since I had not been. After walking about a bit my friends and I got a bit hungry. We decided to consult the Palazzo directory and spotted Emeril's Table 10 restaurant. We just couldn't pass up this opportunity. We got that and were seated immediately, it was a Thursday around 11am, people are probably still passed out from the night before from partying.\n\nHere's what we got:\n\nSpicy Sesame Pork Dumplings: I thought, potsticker or soupy dumplings, but they turn out being Char Siu Bao (BBQ pork bun, baked) looking items. Biting into one was like biting into a slightly denser puff pastry and then you are greeted with the spicy pork filing. The word dumplings and look made me think chinese style, but its more of a fusion between french and chinese styles. A good one worth trying.\n\nNew Orleans Fried Shrimp Po-Boy with natural cut fries: If you like shrimp, this one is a must. The shrimp are a good size and are lightly battered and fried to golden. I don't usually talk about fries but they thicker cut fries here must be double fried because they aren't soft like at most places. They are crispy on the outside and smooth and fluffy on the inside, and so good.\n\nSlow Cooked Pork Po-Boy: Nice sweet molasses BBQ sauce in a freshly baked bread, with those great natural fries like above. The pulled pork was good but not stellar, the bread is what set it apart from others.\n\nEmeril's Banana Cream Pie: When the plate arrives, you are greeted by a 4-5 inch towering slice of banana cream pie with chocolate shavings, caramel sauce and whipped cream. The pie is made well, since it does not sag in any direction. I ran my fork into it easily piercing through the whipped cream, chocolate shavings and caramel, but when my fork met the banana cream, it slowed to a crawl as my fork made its way through the velvety cream and breaking up the pieces of banana. The final layer was the graham cracker crust which require me to exert a bit of sharp force and with a crunch, my fork made it through. I places the forkful of pie in my mouth and my senses were immediately bombarded with a rush of banana taste and aroma. The banana cream was velvety and just sweet enough. The mouth feel was off the charts because of the crunchy graham cracker crust, mixed with the banana cream, sweet slices of banana, whipped cream and nuggets of sweetness from the chocolate shaving and and caramel sauce. I was sharing this and I seriously wanted to order another slice because it was that good, but then I remembered I was stuffed and really shouldn't eat anymore.\n\nThe major highlight of this meal was definitely the dessert. The Banana Cream Pie here redefined Banana Cream Pies for me. NOT TO BE MISSED, you will be sorry if you do.    \n\nI make a very good banana cream pie, so I always try to taste test banana cream pies where ever I go and nothing ever beats the one I make. But this one! Hats off to Emeril, that man knows his banana cream pie."

            "review": "My experience of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants is that they are generally of a high caliber.  Unlike other celebrity chefs, I do not get the impression that Lagasse is content to rest on his laurels, instead he gives the same quality attention to the menu and quality food that made him famous.  Table 10 does not disappoint.  \n\nWe wanted to go to one nicer restaurant while we were in town and this was the consensus choice after perusing menus and prices.  It certainly is a little more on the pricey side, but it is not unreasonable given the quality of the food and service.  I will begin with that: the service was tremendous.  Our waiter was vigilant and took good care of us.  He even honored our check-in deal of a free glass of sangria even though it was slightly after the check in time.  Needless to say, he got a good sized tip.  \n\nMy friend and I had the tasting menu which was incredibly reasonable for the price of $45 dollars.  For my first course I had the bacon.  It was perfectly cooked and not too crispy at all.  It was cured but not dripping with sugar as has happened at other places.  Given the sauce it had a bit of a bite which was quite pleasant.  For dinner I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked with a rich and creamy flavor.  They literally melted in your mouth.  I would recommend it as a main course for anyone; even if you aren't a huge fan of scallops these are well worth it.  Finally, for dessert I had ice cream which was delicious but not necessarily anything to write home about.  \n\nIf you're looking for a good meal on the Strip, this place is well worth it."

I was alone (quite possibly one of my first times ever eating alone in a sit-down restaurant!) so I had time to peruse over the menu and establishment. I sat at the bar hoping maybe I'll run into someone else waiting for their plane flight to come up. Well, she never spoke to me if she did make it to that bar.\n\nOnto the Happy Hour! Ordered:\n\nBeef Satay - No lie, I thought this dish was going to be horrible. I had it set out in my mind that I was going to hate it. However, I really enjoyed the grilled satay beef skewers. The lowest cut of beef they seemed to have use was chuck, the beef was flavorful and melt in your mouth tender. I normally don't like sriracha but the light satay sauce that came with it blended nicely with the sriracha sauce.\n\n3 oysters: I don't have a thing for raw oysters and while they were not the best that I've ever had, I did not find them unenjoyable. Plus they come with three different types of dipping sauces? Yes, please!\n\nCheese Plate (3 different kinds of cheeses): I wish there was a description as to what sort of cheese I was given but alas, they were nowhere to be found. Each cheese came with a small pairing piece by it (jam or honey) and complemented the cheeses very well. Something I can sit and slowly enjoy. I was given a piece with the entire rind on the underside, which bothered me because I don't really like the wax. When I pointed it out to my bartender/server, they immediately rectified the issue and brought me a new slice.\n\nNo Happy Hour is complete without drinks, of course!  Ordered the house pinot grigio, house pinot noir, aqua fresca and vodka tonic. House wines were surprisingly not as bad as I thought it would be. Aqua Fresca and vodka tonic were perfectly refreshing.\n\nThe damage? Less than $50! I ordered so much stuff, the SO thought I went with someone else!\n\nHappy Hour is daily (sat and sun included!) from 4-6PM.\n\nOh, and yes, service was attentive. My water stayed filled and I was consistently checked up on.\n\nEnjoy!"

I had jambalaya, which the server gushed about, but it was made with soggy orzo instead of rice which, being Asian, seems just sacrilegious to me.  My husband had the roast chicken, which was just okay, and he was peeved about having to order asparagus on the side.  Someone else at the table ordered a duck dish that had a nice, round flavor to it.  My cocktail was kind of gross--some monstrosity with big slogs of ginger chunks in it.  I like ginger but I don't like it that much, kids.\n\nThe best thing about the meal were the appetizers.  I remember the crispy shrimp toast one which was delicious.  If I had to come here again (not by choice, probably), I would like to just get a bunch of appetizers to share.\n\nThis restaurant made me feel ripped off.

We arrived and waited a few minutes before our table was ready. \n\nWe sat down and our waiter handed us menus and took drink orders. We settled in and ordered our food. I ordered oyster appetizers and the smoky mushroom pasta. My wife ordered the truffle mac and cheese with a side of grilled chicken on top. Others in our party also placed their orders. \n\n\nThe appetizers quickly came out and we thought thinks would be good but things slowly went downhill from there. The oysters were delicious but a few were not shucked properly and I had to pick out broken shell pieces from my mouth. \n\nAfter the appetizers, we waited and waited for our main course. People at the table were starving from walking around all morning and started to fill up on bread because they were hungry. \n\nWe looked around for our waiter to get refills on our water and drinks but could not find him. \n\nFinally after about 40 minutes our main course came out.  I must admit the smoky mushroom pasta was creamy and delicious. The mac and cheese was also on point but partway through eating the mac and cheese, we found a rare piece of chicken. We told a passing waitress about the rare chicken and she just said \"oh, want a replacement?\"  We declined a replacement as my wife had lost her appetite at this point. They did however take the mac and cheese off the bill. \n\nOverall I would not recommend coming to this restaurant again. We noticed other tables came in after us, who ordered the same items as us receive their meals sooner and faster. We noticed the people serving us were more interested in chitchatting with each other then checking in with their table. \n\nAlso serving rare chicken in a restaurant that is $$$ signs is not acceptable. The kitchen should have checked better before sending out rare chicken which could have made us sick."

She was raving about the Banana Cream Pie.  Hmmm, not exactly my favorite, but sure, let's give it a try.\n\nWe both ordered the quiche, wow, huge portion and we could have (should have) shared.     \n\nDrumroll: That Banana Cream Pie was absolutely delicious!

            "review": "Being a Massachusetts native and having eaten at Emeril's other restaurants in Orlando, Vegas and New Orleans(Commanders Palace when he was there), I wanted to like this place, really I did.  Emeril despite his attempts at upscale dining makes food I usually really like.  His Cajun/Creole offerings are very good, not Paul Prudhomme good, but close.\n\nSo we showed up at this place around 9:30pm on a Fri night, place is half empty.  Oh oh, bad sign.  I read the Yelp reviews and understood what I was in for, or at least I thought so.  Another dumb hostess, seriously do they breed these airheads on a sub off the coast?  She says there is a 20 min wait, umm check again we have a reservation and I can see 6 empty tables?!?  So we sit down to wait, 5 mins go by and now she is ready to seat us, at one of the 6 empty tables...nooo.  She marches us into the area in front of the kitchen door, no lie and points to the table.  I don't think so!  I tell bubble brain I don't want to sit in front of the kitchen door and point to the 6 empty tables, requesting one of them.  \"We aren't using them tonight, we don't have a waiter for that section\"...wtf?\n\nSo great, now we are in the traffic pattern. Its too late to go anywhere else on a Fri night except this dump and eat before 11.  Should have gone to Beijing Noodle #9, better food, hotter hostess, no damn kitchen to sit in front of.\n\nWaiter shows up, along with bread, water boy etc and we order.  Wedge salad for me, carppacio for my dining companion.  Both were good, salad slightly over dressed.  I ordered linguine with clams and counterpart ordered diver scallops.  Here's where it falls apart.  Linguine is over cooked, can't anyone in this town cook pasta?  It is a solid ball of gunk, put my fork in it and pick it all up.  I signal the waiter who comes over and I demo.  He looks at me and says I kid you not, \"Is there a problem\"?  Seriously, he had no idea.  I tell the wunderkind that it is over cooked and he says \"Oh\".  I would have laughed if I wasn't so incredulous.  So he goes and gets the manager, who at least understands its overcooked.  So back it goes, I eat bread and wait and wait and seriously it takes 7 mins to cook pasta, less if its fresh are they farming new clams?\nAbout 15 mins later I get another dish of linguine and clams, but get this, they used the same clams.  Including the one that didnt open the first time they cooked it!  The diver scallops were ok, nothing great.  Dessert was a weird flourless chocolate cake that I have had before elsewhere, but this one was tasteless.  Not a hint of chocolate, kept thinking nah its got to be me, but dining companion agreed.  How do you make a chocolate cake that is tasteless??"

Luckily, there is a \"Taste of Table 10\" option which is a 4 course meal which offers 20+ options of what you can try. So, between my wife and I we were able to try many items including the truffle Mac N cheese that I ordered extra.  \n\nWithout getting into details of every item I will say that everything we tried was excellent including several wine selections by the glass.  Nothing average here.  However, the Filet steak was incredible.  If you read my reviews you will find I have eaten (often) at many of the top steak houses in the country and I can't recall a better tasting steak, ever.  This steak was so full of flavor, cooked exactly to order and tender it was remarkable.  \n\nThe service was super from start to finish and at no time was my water glass much less than 1/2 full and we were checked on frequently despite the restaurant being very busy.  I should also note that our appetizer came out within 3 or 4 minutes of ordering and the second course was just minutes after we finished the first course.  Perfect timing.  \n\nIf you want a great dining experience in Vegas, stop in at Table 10.  Whether you are going for a lunch, a special anniversary dinner or to impress a customer to close a major deal, you won't be disappointed.  \n\nEnjoy!"

My husband got the candied bacon which is barely legal I think - amazing. We had mac n cheese, also delish. I had the braised short ribs and my husband had the filet. Could've died. So good. All the desserts were also amazing - banana pie with layers of banana slices stacked thick with cream, the chocolate flourless cake was rich and amazing, and the donut holes (they call them something else but that's what they are) which were filled with some kind of goodness. It was all so much food - the portions were all quite large. The $45 price of the 4-course dinner was super reasonable. We had an amazing double-date with great friends and great food and could not have been happier with the experience. Highly recommend."

The peach chicken was juicy & flavorful like dark meat but was a meaty breast -- I never order chicken for a nice dinner out, but this was really good and would recommend. \n\nDid I mention the roasted bacon appetizer? They use thick and lean cuts, apply brown sugar and cayenne pepper then roast. Served with a maple dipping sauce - really unique and so good. Was a tad on the spicy side but worked for me. \n\nIf there was anything that wasn't a '10', I'd say the skirt steak. It was very good and lean and flavorful but I've had that elsewhere. Since it was 'only' an 8, it really underscored how great the rest of the dishes were. \n\nFinished with chocolate mousse which was also very good - wife had lemon bar which she said was top notch. \n\nWe may not stay at Venetian next visit to Las Vegas, but we will absolutely come for dinner at Table 10 -- it was great.

So I was especially excited to try out his new venture at the Palazzo hotel. I was staying at the Wynn, so this was conveniently located \"next door\" and just a quick 10 min walk. \n\nTo begin they have these fabulous warm fluffy and surprisingly slightly salty dinner rolls. Yes, salty. I loved this combination. The roll is served warm and buttery and has a light sprinkling of sea salt on top of the roll. Partnered with a small spread of butter it was a great way to begin the dining experience :)\n\nMy friend and I started our meal with one of the daily specials, suggested by our server, Crab Cakes. Now I'll admit that these were pretty small. It's a serving of three cakes about 2-3 bites each. However, they were light on filler and and filled with crab. Though given their size I would've been incredibly disappointed had they been mostly bread crumbs. \n\nFor dinner I had the Grilled Salmon. It was SOOOO good! Served atop a homemade chorizo and tortilla hash, with corn and a tomatillo relish. The Salmon had a great outer crust and was flaky and moist on the inside. The tortilla hash threw me a bit but was a great accompaniment to the fish. The tortillas were just tender (not crispy chips) and the chorizo was fairly lean and slightly spicy.  This \"hash\" would've been a great dish by itself! To share, my friend and I split the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese. WOW O WOW!!!! This truly is a meal in itself and at $17 it could be! This was not your everyday mac 'n' cheese. It was cheesy, creamy, warm, filled with large lobster meat bits and topped with a crusty baked crumb top. HEAVEN! It was soooo good! It  warmed your insides (even though it was 100 degrees outside!) and is simply comforting comfort food :)\n\nThe service was prompt, friendly and courteous. Our server was warm and funny and a good sport. \n\nAn overall GREAT experience, I'm just sad that we were too full to sample any desserts....there's always next time!"

As I was rollin dice at Palazzo I saw a sign for a special 4 course tasting menu at Table 10 for $45.  I know a good deal when I see one so I made a reservation for later that evening.  \n\nI have to admit that a 4 course tasting menu can sometimes not be too filling but I was pleasantly surprised at how large all of the portions were.  I started out with the candied bacon.  Not that I would ever complain about bacon but its kind of like a maple bacon you might get at a lot of places.  The wife got a crab salad which was excellent and had a surprisingly large portion of crab.  For 2nd course, I got a Boston Salad which tasted....... just like a Boston Salad.  The wife went with a beef carpacio.  The carpacio was sliced soooooo thin yet packed such a large amount of flavor..... genius!  For main course I got the Kurobota Pork rack.  It was a huge piece of pork and after I was done I was completely full.  Cooked perfectly as pork can get very dry if overdone.  The wife got scallops which was tasty but maybe the only dish that wasn't a heaping plate of food.  After we were both completely stuffed the waiter asked us what we wanted for desert.  I managed to stuff down maybe half of the banana cream pie I ordered.  Excellent pie and full of banana chunks.  The wife ordered a trio of sorbet and unlike the vast majority of restaurants that give you 2 tiny teaspoons of sorbet Emeril gave us 3 large ice cream scoopers of sorbet!  \n\nVery impressed by this joint.  Would highly recommend.  But I think the 4 course tasting menu was a summer special so it might not be around much longer."

Crab legs were meaty.  Lobster mac and cheese is worth the price with big pieces of lobster, rich.  Malsadas werent great but tiramisu was amazing.  6 people with 5 drinks was over $400.  The food was good but not really fine dining with dirty bathrooms and slow service.  We saw what seemed to be the manager but not personable at all.  Didn't check up on us as I would think for a special Christmas dinner.  It's in the Palazzo shopping center."

Emeril has been a favorite of ours for a long time, so we were excited to try Table 10.  We wanted to stay on-property for our first night in town.\n\nWe were seated next to a half-dressed morning-after bachelorette party, which put a damper on the meal from the start.  We waited 5-10 minutes for menus while the party next to us had speakerphone conversations.  Our waiter ignored us most of the visit in order to placate their requests.\n\nI'm sure the inside of the restaurant might be nice, but we were seated in what can nicely be described as \"mall ambiance\", between the retail stores and the escalator.\n\nThe waiter's assistant brought us a plain flat biscuit (looked like it was from a can) and some water, and appeared to be the only one doing anything.  Very slow return service on water, and no bread refill.\n\nWe chose to share the Crab Hush Puppies (4) as an appetizer.  Paired with the essence mayo sauce that came with it, these were tasty.  Definitely needed the sauce though, and they were a little undercooked.\n\nMy wife chose the Croque Madame, which was a ham and Swiss sandwich with a sunny-side up egg on top, with fried potato wedges and a small balsamic salad. The ham in this was excellent, and she was happy with the sides.  I chose the Lobster Rolls, which came with a small side of cole slaw. The lobster rolls were lobster + mayo on Hawaiian rolls, and they were fine, but since this was Emeril's restaurant, I expected them to be spicy or at least seasoned with Emeril's essence or ANY seasoning.  They could and should have been so much better!  There is an expectation (by me, anyway) that a lobster roll at an Emeril restaurant should be above and beyond what I could get at Lobster Me in Venetian, and it definitely was not.  The cole slaw was overkill on mayo.\n\nWe also ordered the Truffle Mac & Cheese to share as a side.  We were really hoping this would be great, but it definitely was not.  It was not cheesy at all, and had very little flavor.  There was no taste of truffle at all, so it failed on every level to live up to its name except that it did have macaroni in it.\n\nOur excitement to eat at celebrity chef restaurants has been lowered.  Our expectation was that food quality and presentation at a celebrity chef location would be better than average and I do not think that is setting the bar too high.  We have eaten in restaurants bordering the Grand Canal Shoppes that had way less mall-type distractions.  Most of the food was average, but we left half of the truffle macaroni & cheese on the table, which is not the norm for us.   Very disappointing.   I don't think we will be back."

It is not over the top or grandiose, but always enjoyable.\n\nWe came here for Fall Restaurant Week 2013. I was not expecting to be as full as I was, but left stuffed. I started my meal with the BBQ shrimp. Three beautiful pieces in a Creole spice based sauce. Each one cooked to a perfect consistency. The rosemary biscuit was flaky, but on the salty side. With the seasoning and the shrimp, it got to be too much. Next came the scallops. They had the perfect sear on them. I loved the pairing with grapes, almonds and a parsnip puree that enhanced the natural sweetness of the shellfish. To finish off, we got to choose any one of their desserts. I got to taste the tiramisu, his famous banana cream pie, and the almond cake. The latter was definitely the winner of the night. It was light, spongy and soaked up all the flavors well. I could have eaten this for all three courses."

I could have avoided this restaurant and hopefully would have countless others.  \n\nTable 10 gets two stars only thanks to very good service and would receive one star merely on food.  We spent about $100 per head and would have preferred that we had just eaten sushi next door.  \n\nThe disappointments, in order, were were dry, old biscuits that should have been thrown out; a wedge salad that was swimming in watery dressing; sterile gumbo that Emeril's mother would smack him for serving; blackened mahi mahi that had very little flavor served over bland, soggy polenta; and finally cinnamon-sugar doughnuts (Malassadas) that were unfortunately recommended and had less taste and appeal than two-day old Dunkin Doughnut holes (ok, they may actually have been that old). \n\nThere were only two bright spots from the food, the fried calamari had a light but flavorful batter and a soft texture and the lobster pot pie was fully of generous claw meat and crispy vegetables (the only crispy ones that were served).  My other compliment goes to the well trained staff who were friendly, attentive, and helpful.  If the dishes they recommended were this bad, I can only imagine what we missed.  \n\nWhat is to be done with Table 10?  I hope close it down and send more business to the well-run establishments like Delmonicos and Fish House in Las Vegas.  I love NOLA (the hickory roasted duck may be the best in the country, better than Gary Danko here in SF) and Emeril's in New Orleans and know that there is a something there I can, or could, trust for well-seasoned, exciting, and fresh food with signature BAM! \n\nIn one word: Avoid"

            "review": "For our last night in Vegas, we decided to try another Lagasse restaurant and being that it was in our hotel, it seemed like a worthy choice in sea of delicious options. I've dined at Emerils' Delmonico's Steak and that was impressively delicious, but figured that Table 10 would be a nice yet casual option. \n\nThe environment is very nice, very chic decor with a warmth to it that was pleasant upon arrival. We had a reservation but the restaurant wasn't very busy so it wasn't really needed for some reason. Maybe because it was Labor Day weekend? Not sure. It was oddly not busy considering other places in Vegas were for the most part full, so that kind of struck me a bit. \n\nWe ordered some cocktails which were good, nothing really special jumped out at us, but that was okay since we were there for the food. And the food did NOT disappoint! The menu is marked with a few of Emerils Signature dishes that made him famous early on, so we went with a few for starters. I had the crab hush puppies which were in a marmalade that was heavenly. My boyfriend had Emeril's New Orleans BBQ Shrimp, also a HIT for the palate! Then we both decided on the nightly dinner special of Waygu Skirt Steak with Shrimp, Asparagus and Lyonaise potatoes with Blue Cheese. We pretty much cleaned our plates because it was so good. We shared for dessert the White Chocolate Malassadas with Raspberry Sauce which are like tiny beignets filled with white chocolate and covered in cinnamon sugar. Great finish to the meal!\n\nThe service was good for the most part. Two waiters handled our table and were always around to fill glasses and replace drinks. The hostess was pleasant and helpful at the door.\n\nNow you may be wondering why I only gave this restaurant 3 stars? For me it was a small thing but significant. Our dining room was somewhat empty. Maybe 4 tables full at 8:30 at night. And two tables over I see a customer drinking from a long plastic yard arm bottle filled with liquor from another place like Fat Tuesdays and her companion wearing a baseball cap. Considering I'm spending $48 for my entree alone, I found it totally inappropriate to allow customers to bring in alcohol from other places and not be dressed for dinner. Kinda felt like I was at a TGI Fridays. In that regard, Table 10 should readjust because it cheapened the vibe of the restaurant and Emerils' amazing cuisine."

Started out great with the BBQ shrimps, they were delicious, but the main course , steak frites, did not represent what you would expect from an Emeril restaurant. The steak had far too much fat, almost half the steak, and there were no frites but just some fried potatoes. Maybe this is Emerils interpretation of frites, but I was really disappointed. And for the cappuccino or latte the milk was frothed for about a minute and all that was left from the milk is a burned hot white liquid. Quite pricey and unfortunately not what I expected."

Casual dress.\n\nNow that we have the warnings out of the way, let's get to the review! I decided on the 1/2 chicken because I did not see any other reviews on here about it. \n\nThe overall ambience of this restaurant was pleasurable to say the least. It has a modern vibe, but rustic look. Much like the chicken I had. \n\nThe first item delivered to my table after my ice water was two bread rolls. These rolls had a sweet aroma, and right away my mouth began to water. I was getting sweet rolls! Very good, but not the best. The butter was cold, so it was a bit difficult to spread. \n\nOnto the main meal. A beautiful looking chicken was bestowed upon a bed of potatoes surrounded by a molasses looking goo around the plate. The smell was pleasant. When I cut into the chicken I could tell that the it had been cooked well. But when I started eating I was getting any flavor. I was quite disappointed by this. But the chicken was a good quality bird, so that makes up for the lack of flavor within the skin. The potatoes were ok, but they could have done more with this dish.\n\nIn review: This is just a sub par celebrity chef restaurant. Go spend your winnings somewhere else!"

I wish I had trusted the Yelpers that left 2-3 stars at this place.\n\nThere'e a reason why you can find such a good deal on a meal here, and there's a reason why I never saw it full in the 4 days I was at the Venetian. While the atmosphere is lovely, the food is generic in flavor, mediocre in preparation, and inconsistent otherwise. Everything was either incredibly bland or so oversalted that I didn't want to eat it.\n\n- Host stand - Nice greeting and very welcoming.\n- Service - Good, though our server had no personality. When I asked her to pass onto the kitchen that they need to fix their crappy house bread, she was indifferent and clearly had no pride or concern about what the restaurant serves. \"No big deal, just here to collect a paycheck...\"\n\n- Bread - The worst house bread I've had on the strip. So bad I'm writing an entire paragraph on it. When the server puts it on your plate, you can hear it drop like a rock because it's so dense. Flavorless. (The biscuit for the BBQ shrimp is equally hard and dry.) Emeril, please just save your money and stop producing a house bread, or ask the staff to run down to Delmonico and produce double batches on behalf of Table 10.\n- 4 for $45 Bibb salad- Wow. Not good \"wow,\" but bad \"wow.\" This is the most flavorless salad I've had in recent years. Burned bacon, under-seasoned buttermilk dressing (tastes like nothing), 3 baby tomatoes, and lettuce.\n- 4 for $45 BBQ shrimp- these were good. Keep in mind that the BBQ sauce is not the normal barbecue sauce you are thinking of. I can't really describe it, except it's savory and has rosemary. Avoid biscuit on this plate at all costs.\n- Bone-in filet- Share food if you get this! It is at least 12 ounces and comes with carrots and onions. Tasted nice, but super salty dish.\n- Au gratin potatoes- these were miserably salty. After one bite we left them alone.\n- Truffled lobster mac and cheese- kind of disappointing. The portion is good, and there is plenty of lobster, but you can't taste the truffle even when you can see it.\n- 4 for $45 skirt steak- this was cooked nicely and tasted great, though too salty. Served with the same carrots and onions as the filet.\n- Banana cream pie- This is my second time eating Emeril's banana cream pie, first time having been in NOLA. Honestly, it's good, but it's not great. \n\nWe were at Delmonico a few days prior, and that was a delicious restaurant. I would not come back to Table 10 because of how inconsistent the food was. You never knew if you would enjoy what was coming out of the kitchen next, and I'd rather gamble on blackjack than on eating here again."

Special butternut squash ravioli had very little taste.  Pasta part was very nice but the rest of the dish was just plain bland. All other foods are very spicy hot as was the bacon.   I expected food that was  prepared with more of a flare. This was like eating at some cheesy pseudo gourmet.   We started with one waiter and mid meal another waiter took over while the first was still in the restaurant....a little different?   I won't be back."

            "review": "Reviews look to be a bit all over the place for this establishment and I'm probably not about to convince the masses one way or the other being that three of us happened upon this place on accident and then ordered an appetizer and sandwiches, hardly running the gauntlet that the menu provides. But even with that chance encounter, that slight sampling of the items offered and the fact that we were in and out of here within an hour, Table 10 is still a hidden gem in a crowded pavilion of \"me too!\" eateries that do not give you as much flavor and freedom from the touristy masses.\n\nAdmittedly, our luck in Vegas seemed to be solely related to food as it was blind chance that took us here: we were shopping around The Venetian and The Palazzo, and because these centers seem like they were designed with the sole purpose of disorienting you despite you being completely sober, it was not long at all before we ended up at one end of the boutique shops and found this place sitting before us. It rests near the end of one side of The Palazzo storefronts and is kind of ordinary looking: a hostess desk outside (but still indoors) sits alongside a brief patio to the right, as well as in front of a theatre-in-the-round bar that has this spiral staircase in the center of it that is either a great decoration or ascends into the Batcave.\n\nWe were seated in a small dining room to the right adorned with metal fence work on the wall, and within minutes our waiter greeted us and took our drink order. This guy seemed to be fielding every table in every dining room, as it was not unusual to see him through the open windows tending to other guests on the patio. And yet, despite walking more miles in the hour we were there than most people walk in a week, the man kept the pace up and the satisfaction of all his tables equally high. He really did a stellar job with being attentive but not suffocating like an ex when it came to refills and when to order food.\n\nAnd the food... I was still nursing the huge breakfast I had prior to this, so I opted for an appetizer of beef skewers. Sounds lame, maybe, but when those six skewers arrived, they smelled heavenly and tasted probably akin to what the gods are used to gorging on after a day of smiting. My folks went the sandwich route, going for the pork po boy (with molasses BBQ sauce!!!) and the \"perfect '10' BLT.\" Dad had the po boy devoured, citing it as among the best he has ever had. The fries that came with it were decent, but really, when french fries are the least memorable part of your meal, that's a problem along the lines of not driving your third Ferrari because the color of the leather seats clashes with your sunglasses. What I'm saying is the po boy would have been the best item any of us ate if not for Mom's BLT.\n\nBy now, anyone over the age of 14 is sick of the Internet culture adopting bacon and ruining it by repeatedly bringing it up, much like zombies, cats and zombies playing with cats. But trust me when I say this bacon is worth the price of admission alone. Mom was gracious enough to spare a slab for both Dad and myself and I'm pretty sure I lost track of time and space while eating mine, like I was having an out-of-body experience without leaving the table. I guess the rest of the sandwich was good but hey, bacon that good is a tough act to follow.\n\nLike I said, we were here for just an hour and had an appetizer and sandwiches. Not really the full Table 10 experience but in no way indicative of some of the disparaging reviews I see below mine. Give Table 10 a shot - it stands out by not trying to stand out, and that's worth a minimum of five stars in my book."

My company took us here, so I didn't have to pay, but had I paid, I'd want my money back. \n\nWe had a prix fixe menu, so part of it is the lack of choice, but even so, if I am at a high end restaraunt, I expect that the chef will take pride in every dish, so nothing should be substandard, and this meal definitely was.\n\nI had the vegetarian menu. Problem 1 was that they didn't give us a veggie first course at all. So there's a dozen people, eating a crab salad course around us, and the vegetarians are just sitting there waiting. Absolutely not ok. How hard is it to make the same salad and just skip the crabmeat. \n\nThe second course for meat eaters were spicy shrimp that people seemed happy with and smelled pretty good. For veggies the course was creamy risotto with vegetables. Great idea in theory, but undercooked (and I do not mean al dente, I really mean undercooked) and oversalted. And I love salt, so that takes effort.\n\nThird course. Vegetarians got pasta. A second starch. Really? We just had risotto. The meat eaters got halibut and gnocchi. I do eat fish, so my boyfriend traded with me and ate my pasta and I had his food. I did enjoy this course. It was also a bit salty, but well cooked and I really liked the veggies mix with it. The gnocchi was just ok.\n\nNext, the main course. Everyone received a steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Time went by. An uncomfortable amount of time. Some people were almost done with their steak. Then the vegetarian food came. Surprise! They seemed to be fresh out of ideas because the meal was mashed potatoes and a side of asparagus, and a couple slivers of mushroom. As in, they just skipped the steak, piled on extra potatoes, and called that a main course. That's not a main course. That's a side, and after 2 other starch dishes, not even a creative one. Sigh. I had asparagus. The potatoes were good potatoes, but really not what you want as your main course. How hard would it have been to grill a whole portabello? My friend wasn't crazy about his steak either, and he loves steak.\n\nLast but not least, dessert was cheesecake. It had a a berry sauce. The berry sauce was cook, the cheesecake completely average. You can't really have bad cheesecake, but I expected great cheesecake, not something equal to the stuff you get at Safeway. So I saved the calories instead, since there was a Bouchon Bakery downstairs that was infinitely better, and life is too damn short to eat average dessert.\n\nOne positive side - they carry a good selection of top shelf vodka, and my drink was great, which is what pushed my review to 2 stars. The sauvignon blanc was also good.\n\nSo the overall point is, I got this meal free, I'm thankful to my work for taking us out, but if I am ever given the choice to go again I will be passing on it."

Could barely taste the alcohol, but knew it was there because I could feel it a few sips in.   \n\nFor our main course, she had the Cordon Blue pasta, which was surprisingly good.  I had the Special, which was a petit filet mignon, small lobster tail, and included mashed potates with a light wine sauce with pieces of chorizo sausage.

We all ordered different items, including a couple of the specials. The seafood items were ok and the lobster pot pie had some whole pieces of claw meat. The rotisserie and beef entrees were good, as were the sides. \n\nThe desserts were nice, but there was no bam to be found. Emeril's wines were surprisingly good. The rhone red blend was decent, the chardonnay much better. \n\nThe service itself was hit or miss. Everyone was very friendly and our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. The wine and starters all came out without a problem. Then we moved to our entrees. They were brought under those room service lids and placed on a tray next to our table. Where they sat for several minutes as 4 servers had to be rounded up to simultaneously place the dishes. And they didn't even need 4 because 2 servers gave us the mains while the other 2 gave us the sides - and there were only 2 side dishes. My dish probably wasn't piping hot as it was, but the extra wait basically made everything on my plate lukewarm. \n\nBeing so close to the opening, I guess they're still working out some of the kinks. Having reservations on OT makes it somewhat more likely that I'll go back to see if they've worked things out."

Our table was actually outside on the indoor \"terrace\" meaning we got a chance to people watch people walking through the casino.  Although the tables inside were made of wood, our table outside was made of copper and I could smell copper throughout our whole dinner experience so that did put a damper on the dining experience (I would recommend a seat inside the restaurant).\n\nFood: The food is upscale big easy Louisiana inspired seafood. We had a sampling of pretty much the entire menu: creole mahi mahi, seafood jambalaya, halibut, lobster pot pie, calamari, lobster mac & cheese, and crab beignets.  The food was o.k., nothing to rave about on the car ride back to Los Angeles that's for sure and I love Cajon/Creole food. The lobster mac & cheese sounded so good (I'm a huge fan of cheese) but it was actually a little too cheesy and salty.

My one and only dining experience for this season's RW, unfortunately. We arrived shortly after they opened and were seated in the empty front dining area. Our server was prompt and courteous, continually checking on us throughout the meal and our drinks were topped off consistently.\n\nMy mother and I both started off with the Boston Salad that came with big, leafy greens, giant tomatoes, big chunks of bacon, and buttermilk ranch dressing with fresh cracked black pepper. Phenomenal! I could have this salad just as an entree and be fine. The quality of the lettuce was exceptional and each bite was crisp and enjoyable.\n\nNext, my mother chose the peach roasted chicken and I wish I had gotten it too! It was flavorful, tender, and juicy, with a crispy skin, and spiced perfectly. It came with a savory bread pudding and grilled mushrooms. \n\nI opted for the lobster ravioli which was disappointing. While the raviolis themselves were well cooked and stuffed nicely with lobster the tomato butter it was served in was terribly off-putting for me and I really disliked the Cajun flavor to it (I know, Emeril's cooking style IS Cajun!), but still just not great in my opinion and very lackluster. It came topped with cuts of asparagus and not even they could pick the dish up.\n\nLastly, dessert was delish. I had the Chocolate Mousse Cake, which was so so decadent, but fluffy and sinfully sweet. My mother opted for the very famous banana cream pie (which I have had before), and she said it was exquisite. \n\nOverall the disappointment in my main entree was balanced by the good service, salad, and dessert. I am sure this miss with the entree is an exception, not a consistency."

For $45 you get four courses.  You can add the optional wine pairing for an additional $28. (Um...No brainer.)  \n\n1st course - Boston Lettuce Salad (windrose farms head lettuce - bacon - chive - buttermilk dressing - heirloom tomatoes) paired with the Banfi Chianti Classico\n \n2nd course - SQUASH Gnudi - pecan - sage butter - romano cheese (a very well put together dish so much lighter than gnocchi that paired well with the pinot) Talbott \"Logan\" Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir.\n\n3rd course - WAGYU SKIRT STEAK with potato pur\u00e9e - spinach - red wine sauce paired with a Don Miguel Gascon Malbec.  (This dish was so luscious and melted in your mouth)\n\n4th course - EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE\nwith chocolate shavings, caramel sauce and whipped cream and that was paired with (I believe) a late harvest Chardonnay.\n\nWith tip and some additional wine it came out to be less than $110 per person.  As you know in Vegas this is a steal when everywhere else we had gone on the strip was much more expensive with nowhere the quality and service we received.  I'll be back next trip.  Well done!"

When compare to a handful of other fantastic choices of restaurant, Table 10 does not stand out at all.\n\nNice and polite service, however not too personable.  The interior and ambiance is nice but not extraordinary.  I've heard not to order any of their house salad, so I started with a Tomato Bisque, which was wonderful.  The whole showing of synchronizing the serving of dishes, and pouring the soup from the pot to your plate in front out you, appears to be a bit sloppy.  I prefer having the soup serve to me hot and simple.  Thank you. \n\nThe lamb and foie gras appetizer cost $22, and was only alright.  Foie Gras was burnt on purpose which was weird.  Then I was surprised by the Mediterranean Sea Bass marinated with tomato, etc.  It was very very fishy... and it's at $37.  Obviously mediterranean sea bass is very different from the Chilean sea bass.  \n\nOne of the person in our party had requested a Vegetarian dish, and even though it wasn't on the menu, they had been graceful and helpful about our special request.\n\nGiven with the vast amount of other great choices in Las Vegas, I probably will not go back.  This restaurant is mediocre and doesn't worth a special trip to visit."

The waitstaff was very professional and attentive. \n\nA review of the entrees - \n\nThe scallops, which we ordered as an appetizer, were well-cooked and -seasoned, with some fantastic charring and garnishes surrounding a velvety interior. Although the pieces were large, at nearly $10/scallop this felt overpriced.\n\nFor the main, I had the small striped bass, a whole, deboned/deheaded poached in olive oil . The texture was fantastic, the sauce was light and complementary to the fish, and the portion was massive - well worth the $32. Three at the table ordered the salmon, which they seemed to enjoy. The jambalaya and ribeye seemed to be mediocre.\n\nThe side of creamed spinach was huge - easily enough for two.\n\nThe malassadas (donut holes) weren't very pleasant and the sorbets were unmemorable. Our bill came out to 650 for six largely due to wine and multiple orders of scallops. \n\nWith some menu previewing, a small group could have a great experience here. Pricing disparities are counterbalanced by generous portions and good-quality food.\n\nAs an aside - I noticed on my last day that the Venetian/Palazzo was offering 20% off coupons to Table 10 for hotel guests. It might be something worth checking out at the front desk before heading over."

It was just some craminis with wine. I've made the same dish home plenty of time. A spring of fresh thyme does not a fancy dish make.\n\nSalmon: This was pretty unique and I liked it a lot. It was a grilled salmon on top of what I can only describe as a tortilla bed. Kinda different, good!\n\nLamb: Cooked to perfection\n\nCoffee Cake: This was a great dessert, but it was the doughnut things that shined.\n\nDoughnuts: I can only describe these as white chocolate filled chorro flavored doughnut holes with a icing.

Thick bacon, syrup to add if you want it a little sweeter, spicy after-burn. The entree was the filet mignon, I had the chicken.  Both were excellent.  Tender steaks.  For desert we had the berry cobbler which I liked  but a few at the table didn't because it was not crispy on top.  I do prefer the crispy topping, but it was still great.

I ordered the gumbo to start with and I must say that I was really disappointed. After watching Emeril's show - I expected his recipes to be a lot better.

I always loved watching Emeril on television, and Table 10 was my ticket to actually taste his food. BAM!\n\nFirst of all, if you have any children two years old or younger that can't sit still, avoid bringing them to Table 10. While the prices, in my opinion, aren't that steep, this is a celebrity restaurant, dude! Would you bring a mentally unstable baboon to a fancy Jewish wedding? Please note : I'm not calling anyone's child (including my own) a mentally unstable baboon, and my child is not going to a fancy Jewish wedding.\n\nThe service was great (very attentive and properly mannered staff), the joint was spotless, and the food was borderline bodacious. My party of three went for lunch on a Friday, and we had no wait and a near empty dining room waiting for us. For just under 45 dollars (not including tip) we got a few complimentary bread rolls, a small pizza, pork po' boy with fries, and a Prosciutto Panini with a side salad. The six glasses of tap water I had were exceptional as well. Unlike the water they have on tap in New Orleans. \n\nI have not done the research, but even though Table 10 bears Emeril's name, I wouldn't doubt if the man himself hasn't even broken wind in his own restaurant. Hell, I'm just guessing, but Emeril Lagasse probably didn't even create the menu. Hey.... LEAVE THE GUY ALONE! HE'S A BUSY MAN CHOWING DOWN LOTS OF TASTY EATS AND SELLING FOOD ACCESSORIES ON TV! \n\nEven if Emeril had little to do with Table 10, I am proud to say that I ate at one of my favorite celebrity chef's restaurants. With the exception of an odd tasting pizza for an appetizer, Table 10 was a pleasant experience. When I go to Mc Donalds tomorrow (and three times a week for the rest of my life. I'm not proud of that.), I'm going to pretend my Mc Double is a Slow Cooked Pork Po' Boy from Table 10."

We came right around 5pm, when dinner starts, so it was really slow and empty so our service was outstanding.  We chose to sit outside in the patio, which wasn't as dimmed as it was inside the restaurant.  We got the Taste of Table 10, four courses for $48 for dinner.  I ordered the Caesar salad for my first course, New Orleans BBQ shrimp for second, filet mignon for third and the raspberry panna cotta for fourth course/dessert.  I liked the Caesar, came with whole leafs of lettuce and a crostini, which was quite chewy and dry.  My friend got the gumbo, which I got a bite of, taste was okay, had the right amount of spices but no flavor. The second course had big jumbo shrimp with a sweet and light BBQ sauce drenched over it.  Only thing I didn't like was the biscuit, quite dry and cold when served.  Next, was the filet mignon, which was a lot more than I thought but no complaints there, served with a bunch of pearl onions and glazed carrots and was really tender and soft and cooked to my liking.

Soon after one of the chefs came up to our table and introduced himself. Really friendly person named Wesley. He gave us horderves that were compliments of the house. They were delicious.\nThe bacon they served us came with a side of syrup that carmalized as soon as it touched the bacon. Very decadent. \nLater he came back with some turkey for us to try. Which was also amazing.\nMy filet mignon was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life.\nThe timing between the courses was perfect I believe they were watching us and making sure we had finished the course we were working on before bring is the next course. So we were not rushed at all. Whenever my glass was low they refilled my drink right away. I cannot speak highly enough about the service I received at Table 10. I would like to thank them and Wesley for making our 8th Anniversary dinner one to remember. I will be coming back any time I'm in Las Vegas. I will also be recommending this place to my friends and family. Five stars. I would give 6 stars if I could. This place went above and beyond for us."

I ordered the tasting menu, broccoli cheese soup, crab cake, filet ($5 extra charge) and banana cream pie.  Broccoli cheese soup was well seasoned and flavorful, and had tempura broccoli in the middle for extra flavor and a little crunch. Crab cake was well cooked and flavorful with a sweet aioli. The real star was the filet. Perfect char on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside, and bursting with flavor. My husband ordered the golden seared scallops (which were also very good) and wished he had ordered the filet. My only disappointment (and the reason I took away half a star) was the dessert. We took the server's recommendation and ordered the banana cream pie. The bananas were definitely not fresh,  and were browned and squishy. The dessert had obviously been in the fridge for a few days. If it truly is the best dessert, as the server stated, it doesn't speak well for the other desserts. Service was very efficient, although not particularly friendly. We never lacked for anything. I would definitely return for the delicious food."

It was slightly watered down but overall sweet and refreshing. I got the bbq shrimp for my appetizer and it was really good. Very flavorful, a good portion, and I loved the rosemary biscuit. For my entree I had the mac and cheese and that was unfortunately a bit disappointing. In my opinion it didn't have enough of a good crust at the top and I wish it had been stronger in the truffle flavor. My husband got the pork po boy and it was only okay. Overall good, but we expected a bit more being an Emeril restaurant."

The sauce served with the escargot had great and different flavors, and the bread that comes with it made the dish so yummy altogether.

Table 10, an Emril Lagasse restaurant, was fairly empty and so seating was simple. This restaurant has pretty nice d\u00e9cor with dark grain woods but a bit dim where we were seated.\n\nThe cuisine here is American with a Cajun flare. We all opted for a four course dinner for $48 that comes with a soup or salad, appetizer, entr\u00e9e, and dessert.  \n\nOur dinner started it some cocktails which were pretty good and strong. For our soup/salad option, we all chose the chicken andouille gumbo which was very tasty. For appetizers, we share the candied maple bacon, New Orleans bbq shrimp, and mushroom puffs. The bacon was utterly delicious as so was the bbq shrimp that came with Cajun bbq glaze and rosemary biscuit. Mushroom puff was just okay. For or entr\u00e9e, we all chose the 6oz filet migon in a red wine sauce. Pretty good but wished I ordered the pork chop. \n\nOur last options included dessert which is the most important part of dinner. We chose the infamous banana cream pie, spiced carrot cake, and milk chocolate mousse smores. The banana cream pie was good. I've had it before so it didn't wow me. Came with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. The milk chocolate mousse smores was a bit too sweet for me. Spiced carrot cake with candied pecans and orange bourbon sauce was my favorite. One of the better carrot cakes I've had in the longest time. \n\nService was great here and very attentive making sure our table was clean after each course. \nFood was good, not great but a bargain. We left full so we were content. Oink!!"

It was my birthday dinner, and I had spent a lot of time researching for the place I wanted to go.  \nMy boyfriend and I arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation and I was glad to be seated despite our premature arrival.  We were seated near the back of the restaurant with a view of what I assume is the chef's table and the kitchen.  I was pretty stoked, since I consider that a pretty cool view.  \nI think our waitresses name was Elizabeth.  We got our menus and I was very excited about the Parmesan cheese crusted pan seared scallops on portabello mushrooms with risotto and micro basil and a port wine butter.  WHAT? yes.  Probably one of the most delicious things I've eaten ever.  Seriously.  \nThe appetizer helped me decide that I should get the salmon for dinner, it had artichoke hearts, spinach, tomatoes, and wild mushrooms.  I asked Elizabeth if I should get the Riesling or Pinot grigio , and she suggested the latter because the fish was not spicy.  Boy, was she under exaggerating.  The cast iron pan seared salmon was completely unseasoned. And, to my utter dismay, our pepper grinder was not working.  It took until they reset the table next to us to get a functional one, and by that time I was nearly done with my bland and over-cooked salmon (I ordered it medium and it was very well done) anyway, and I was pretty over it.  However the wine did go very well and the two helped enhance each other.  It was a good recommendation.\nMy boyfriend had the lemon herb chicken and got mashed potatoes because he didn't want sour cream."

Reservations are made for a reason (especially on a Saturday night), so that we have a table as soon as we get there.When I asked the seating hostess about our table, she just looked so annoyed and told me it would be ready soon. When we finally did sit down, it was a table all the way in the corner when there were plenty of other open ones. Out waitress was very sweet at first and immediately took our order with no problems. My friend and I both opted for the Piri Piri seafood pasta (one of Emiril's CLASSICS), but then decided that since we both wanted it, we'd just share it. We asked our waitress if she could split it for us and said it wouldn't be a problem. The bread and appitizer salads came out very quickly, but nobody came to clear the plates away when we were or refill our water (likely because we were at the table all the way in the corner).  When the food finally came,  30 mintues later, the waitress put down the pasta in front of me and a side dish for sharing. This is a pasta dish with seafood. You can't just hand me a side bread plate and then say split the pasta yourself. So I proceeded to ask the waitress if perhaps the chefs in the kitchen could split it for us in 2 seperate bowls(like I'd originally asked), especially since my friend and I were at opposite ends of the table. She looked at me like I'd asked her to do something unheard of and took the plate back to the kitchen. She returned with 2 seperate bowls 5 minutes later and angrily dropped them in front of us and walked away. When I thanked her, she just walked away. We were really disappointed with the service. We then told the manager what had happened and she offered us a free dessert which we did not want, so the agreed to comp the pasta dish. While that was very nice of the manager to do, we were still very disappointed with the service and ended up being late to our next engagement that evening. \n\nDespite the terrible service, we couldn't help but be impressed by how good the food was!"

I'm thinking Emeril's going to create a wonderful dish since his background is New Orleans. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The roux really lack any real crawfish flavor. It was kind of like a bland red sauce and the roux itself was close to becoming paste. And those of you who understand the nature of roux know that it should be somewhat of a medium to thick gravy, but not a paste. His was perilously close to paste. \n\nWe have a food truck here that does southern, and for $10 I get a great crawfish etouffee, and I don't have to leave a tip. I think for those of use who really enjoy New Orleans style cuisine, do your research if you go to Table 10. I think you might even ask to get a taste of the roux before you order the main entree.\n\nBy the way, there were freshly cut pieces of tomatoes dropped in the roux. NO, NO, NO! You cook the tomatoes along with the trinity in the roux. I can't recommend the etouffee. \n\n2.5 stars for the etouffee, a half more for the restaurant's ambiance."

We were tired and suffering from the time change early in our week at the Palazzo and hit Table 10 for a quick dinner.  Candied North Country Farm Bacon is to die for - real wow factor.  Everything else was good and well executed.  Wine corkage fee was reasonable and no hassle about bringing our own wine."

We had trouble finding breakfast in the morning so after walking around the Venetian & the Palazzo for a place to eat so we ran into Table 10, which we found was an Emeril Lagasse restaurant. We went in just after 11 AM and were quickly seated. We started with the gumbo appetizer. Very nice. Well spiced with large pieces of chicken & andouille sausage in it. Good start. For lunch I had the Angus beef burger. Wow this was a massive burger. Perfectly cooked although the onion marmalade was a bit jarring because of the sweetness. My companion had the quiche souffle, a warm & soft pastry loaded with cheese and large bacon pieces. Outstanding. I know we were there early but the service was excellent. Super attentive and my water glass (one of the ways I use to judge service) was constantly filled. I highly recommend Table 10."

This is a bar that faces the kitchen where you can watch all of the food being prepared. The person cooking right in front of you will talk to you and explain what he is making if you ask.\n\nThe food here is pretty good. Everything is above average in quality and the portions are large.\n\nI've had the chili chicken wings, gumbo, Brussel sprouts, duck, sweet potato gnocchi, calamari, and tried a few other random things.\n\nOf all the things I have had, I think the gumbo is probably the best. It's slightly spicy and not too overwhelming on any ingredient.\n\nOne thing I really like is how they split plates. If you order something to share, they will give each person their own plate with a smaller portion.\n\nI can't really say I've had an \"Oh my God!\" moment here. Everything has been pretty good though and I will eat here again."

Table 10 was offering a three course lunch for $20 which is a great deal.\n\nThe restaurant is located in The Grand Canal Shop area near some of the higher end stores like Kate Spade and Michael Kors. The restaurant seating is partly inside and part is in front of the restaurant where the halls are for the shops. The seating in front would be a good option for those that enjoy people watching since Vegas has plenty of gems to see.\n\nBefore we ordered we were served warm yeast rolls that were very good. I love fresh made bread. I started with the Beet Salad which was the best part of my meal. It had fresh roasted beets, goat cheese, and a pistachio butter. The pistachio butter was so good and definitely added something to the salad. My husband had the Chicken & Andouille Gumbo which he said was good, but not the best he's ever had.\n\nFor the second course we both had the New Orleans Shrimp Po Boy. The shrimp inside was nicely seasoned and there was a nice amount of shrimp. The sandwich was more than enough food for one. Overall, the sandwich was pretty good. I really liked the crispy, thick fries served with the po boy.\n\nDessert was a win for both of us. My husband had the Banana Cream Pie which he loved and the slice was a very generous slice. I had the White Chocolate Malasadas. I decided to order them even though I had no idea what malasadas are, but it was a good choice because they were so yummy. The malasadas are delicious and light fried dough with white chocolate in the middle and sugar on the outside. I loved this dessert and thought it was unique to the dessert options I see at other restaurants.\n\nThe service was not horrible, but could have been better. Our waitress was friendly and checked in on us, but we went long periods without seeing anyone. Our lunch was almost two hours long for a pre-fixe menu. We started out okay with bread and starters coming out without much wait, but then everything went to snail pace after that. Our po boys took a long time to arrive at the table. Dessert wasn't a long wait, but then we had to wait a long time to get the check. I actually started to wonder if the waitress had left for the day because she wasn't even walking around and nobody else was even passing by to ask for our waitress. Eventually she came back, but the slow service kind of soured the experience.\n\nThe dinner menu looks interesting and I liked the feel of the restaurant so I would consider coming here again. Our lunch was pretty good and hopefully the slow service was a one off."

A 5 star restaurant that was also quiet, elegant and reasonably priced.  \n\nMy wife and I visit vegas quite often (5-10 times per year) mainly to enjoy the shows, restaurants and shopping. While there are many fine restaurants by some of the world's top chefs - few also offer this rare combination of a quiet dining experience (in Vegas!) plus world-class food, reasonably priced, AND with reasonable portions.  \n\nOn a Saturday night, my wife and I went to look for a nice restaurant for a quiet dinner.  We saw a few small signs for Table-10, and found it in a rather discrete location  (away from the concentration of restaurants and shops, pleasantly perched on the second floor)).   When we got there, we were pleasantly surprised by several things:\n\n1. there was no wait!  (for such a restaurant on a saturday night - this was astounding).\n2. the restaurant was not crowded, and it was quiet enough for us to enjoy and have a conversation.\n3. they had a $45 dinner special - 4 courses - with a variety of choices that were memorable and delicious.\n\nOne notable part of the meal experience ...  the portions.  One of my main complaints about Vegas restaurants (and about everything in vegas) is stressing Quantity over Quality.  Most restaurants cater to the tourist who wants value (quantity) for their money, and thus they pile on the portions to the point where you really cannot appreciate the meal.  Table-10 ... the portions were just perfect:  Satisfying but just enough to truly appreciate the cooking and to look forward to the next course.\n\nLast - I will echo some of the other recommendations here - the Banana Cream \"cake\" - was amazing  (while I expected the entrees from an Emeril restaurant to be 5-star, the deserts were also memorable)-   \n\nHighly recommended!   But keep it a secret so we can get another quiet table next time!"

Possibly because of that, the service was excellent - attentive refilling of water, second offering of warm fluffy rolls, and  refolding of napkins during bathroom breaks.  These little things are nice when unexpected.\n\nMy friends got filet mignons (~$40), which were delicious for their carnivore delights.  I opted to double up on appetizers for the same price (~$15 each).  The half rack of Kuronuta baby back ribs were very tender with the right amount of slightly spicy sauce, and the pickled corn on top actually pair welled with the ribs.  The mushroom fettuccine (I think it was fettuccine?) was delicious - the cream sauce was light, although some might think there were too many mushrooms (which I like).\n\nThe Frangelico cr\u00e8me brulee was AMAZING.  The custard filling was just the right consistency and not too sweet.  This was balanced by the rich caramel burnt-crust goodness.  We were surprised to find a layer of baked hazelnut chocolate at the bottom, which was unnecessary and a bit too dark chocolately for my taste.  The birthday girl also got free coconut ice cream, which was good but merely an understudy to the spectacular cr\u00e8me brulee.\n\nAs evidenced by the young couple who came just for dessert, Table 10 is definitely a place to impress a date with good service, delicious food, and amazing desserts.... or merely to impress you and your stomach."

The service was excellent - the bartender was very busy covering all of the bar patrons as well as the people at the lounge tables eating dinner, and he still managed to be very attentive and made sure I was taken care of. \n\nThe major disappointment, however, was the food. I had the hush puppies, which were good, but I did not care for the tomato chutney they came with. The corn chowder was delicious, and that was definitely the saving grace of the meal. I ordered a salad from the specials that had mixed greens, tomato, crab, and some kind of cheese. It was not good. The dressing tasted like plain mayonnaise, and the lettuce did not taste fresh. The crab was also poached, which I didn't remember reading in the menu, because I probably would not have ordered it. Luckily the chowder filled me up, because I honestly could not eat more than a handful of bites of this salad. How do you mess up a salad??\n\nThe bartender noticed that I did not eat much of my salad, and when I told him I hadn't enjoyed it, he took it off my bill! That was awesome and totally unexpected. \n\nI spent a good amount of time trying to decide where to eat since I'm only in Vegas for a few days, so I was disappointed that I didn't have the tasty meal I was hoping for.

Its name is fitting because it Deserves a 10 on almost every level.  It is pricey but I had a twenty percent off voucher which helped to keep the dollar amount reasonable. We started with drinks and this was really the only part of the meal that could have been improved on. Simone had a Lychee martini and I went with a mojito. They were good but probably not much better then I could find at any bar anywhere at half the price.  For the meal itself Simone and I decided that we would share everything. When I let the server know this he was more then happy to bring us extra plates with each food item. While we waited for our first food items we enjoyed some great fluffy, buttery flaky dinner rolls. Then the appetizers arrived. First was the Grissini Bread sticks wrapped with Pancetta and glazed with Truffle butter. These were as amazing as they sounded. They were handmade in the kitchen and were thin crispy, salty and rich and highly addictive. Next up were grilled salt and pepper Pea pods. Slightly charred and salty sweet, they were drizzled with Olive Oil and Lemon Juice. Upscale finger food at its best, the only small issue I had was that some of the peas were more tender then others but the taste was spot on. Our last appetizer was the Candied Bacon. Hand cut thick strips of smoked pork belly with a sugary caramelized amber crust. These melted instantly in your mouth and were taken up another notch when drizzled with the maple butter then came along with them. For our shared entree we choose the Beer Glazed Duck Breast with Creole seasoned house sausage, hush puppies and lightly steamed Green Beans.  The meal came out on two plates already cut into two equal portions for us. I thought this was a real nice gesture from the kitchen and it was much appreciated as many restaurants don't like people sharing plates but Table 10 actually seems to encourage it.  The duck was the most tender I have ever had and it was cooked perfectly medium as I requested. The glaze was slightly sweet but not overpowering and the sides were equally as good especially when dragged through the glaze. Because we split our meals, we had plenty of room for dessert and so we had two. One was an Almond cake and the Other a Chocolate Mousse cake. The Chocolate cake was dark chocolate so it was not to sweet but was topped with raspberry sauce that made up for it and balanced it out. I enjoyed it, but my favorite was the Almond Cake. It was super moist and rich but was topped with a very light and refreshing homemade Basil sorbet to cut through the deep flavor of the almond.   This was a terrific end to a top notch foodie experience. This will be one of my Vegas Favorites for many years to come."

We basically had the place to ourselves. The service was impeccable but having worked for years as a server I expect nothing less on a slow night. We started out with wine and appetizers. It's hard to go wrong with wine when my stepdad picks(and is buying for that matter). Calamari and escargot were nothing to write home about. The calamari had a weird texture almost like it wasn't quite done and the aioli was bland. I was even more disappointed with the escargot. Hardly any flavor to it at all. My filet on the other hand was cooked to perfection. Although as long as you don't overcook it filet is good without any help. The smashed potatoes were the best I've ever had. No dessert. Didn't see one that stood out to me which shouldn't be that hard to do. The ambiance was great except for the the way the bar was set up. Every time the bartender set the bar down behind him it was so loud it made me jump. I also loved all the open kitchen and the spice shelves (emeril needs more than a rack apparently) although I thought the Costco size tub of Zatarains seasoning was weird(yes I know he's from New Orleans). One of these things is not like the other.... I would go back but would not be at the top of my list. I just felt a little let down by this famous food network guy."

            "review": "Went here for an event dinner with a set 5 course meal. I was expecting a lot since it is Emeril Lagassi's restaurant.\n\nOverall the food was VERY rich. Dishes you can really enjoy in small quantities. So I was happy to have 5 courses of different flavors. \n\nAppetizers - Mushroom dumplings were actually really really good. Made out of similar wraps they use at chinese restaurants. Other appetizers included shrimp. All I have to say is I've never seen such a big juicy shrimp! man! delicious!\n\nCourse 1 was a \"organic\" salad - nothing special\nCourse 2 was a serving of 2 big ravioli's filled with shredded bbq pork. It was SO sweet. The first bite was good, but I really hesitated in finishing the 2nd ravioli. The entire thing was drenched in teriyaki sauce. I did appreciate the chesse among the beef, it had a bitter kick to the sweetness. I could see a lot of people appreciating the saltiness of the beef with the sweetness of the sauce.. but I was not a fan.\nCourse 3 was Mahi Mahi. It was supposed to be seared, but definately cooked all the way through.  This was my favorite dish of the night. I could tell the work and effort it took to make all the flavors in this dish come together. The fish was on top of a corn puree with tortilla chips. Almost like a gourmet fish/mexican dish! You really had to taste each individual sauce and component to decipher what it was. But when put together, it worked so well! Fish was DELICIOUSLY cooked!\nCourse 4 - prime rib! Huge portion and i had 2 bites and left the rest of the plate. The meat was on top of mash potatos and asparagus. Most of the prime rib came out medium to rare and made a bunch of us a little queezy. I thought it was delicious, but was too full by this point. \n\nDessert - creme brulee. I was expecting.. crunch on top, light cream in the middle. NO. We got the thickest pudding/fudge chocolate... I took one bite and left the rest there also. But I did hear that their desserts are excellent here. \n\nOverall, the food was all very different. Semething you definately can't find most places - especially the combination of ingredients!  Felt like all the dishes were well thought out and put together. And of course - the service was excellent!"

This place was still on the lunch menu so we were happy.\n\nThe prosciutto sandwich was horrible.  We both ordered it.  It was vinegar SOAKED... the bread was falling apart, they put the prosciutto (AKA salt cured ham that is NOT cooked) into the panini maker they clearly used... and the entire plate was just a mess.  My salad had brown lettuce and mostly the SEEDS of tomatoes.\n\nI ordered a sangria (white).  I should have known better.  It tasted like water, and had an ugly smooshed cherry on top and a tattered looking orange slice.\n\nWait staff?  What wait staff?  We waited up front so long for someone (over two minutes) we thought we seated ourselves.  I said I wanted NO water (we were at a small table and I don't like tap water, why waste the space?) and I was promptly delivered a glass.\n\nShe came back right after the food arrived and we never saw her again until the, \"Shall I bring you a dessert menu?\" conversation.\n\nI get having 8 people do 8 different jobs... but one to seat us, one to bring us water we don't want, one to deliver menus, one to take an order, two to bring the food... is ridiculous.  Spend all that money on a better chef and I will wait longer for a refill.\n\nD-, Emeril.  Very disappointed."

Service was fair at best for a place like this and the pacing SUCKED.  Also how stupid are you to not be able to bring out the correct desserts to a party of 8...\n\nwhat really bothered me is a saw a chef chilling at the bar.  just staring out into the entrance.  how about you get back in the kitchen and do your job.  if the meal was good/great then fine lurk around.  NOPE\n\nfor 50 a head i would go somewhere else.  honestly this is just an upgrade from your standard higher end chains.  nothing blew me away except maybe the shrimp and the filet.

My friend had the beef short rib and could not stop raving.  I also have to mention that my friend is the farthest thing from a foodie.  He could care less about what hes having and rarely comments on the quality.  \n\nOne of the highlights was the bread served prior to the meal.  Apparently it is bread from the Parker Brothers Bakery in Boston?  I have never heard of them but again for such a simple ingredient it added a great element to the meal and experience.\n\nOur server(s) were extremely polite and helpful.

Our server Kasey, immediately attended the table and introduced herself and her support staff. I started with a gin martini that came as ordered and with three olives! My companions studied the wine list that had a wide and varied selection.\n\nAfter much debate, for appetizers, my two dining mates shared a calamari starter; the calamari had a light batter, was crisp and tender and came with two delectable sauces. I opted for the gumbo. This was worth the visit alone. A bigger portion and this could have sufficed for a main course.\n\nFor the main course one of my companions selected the lobster pot pie. This was an interesting concoction with lobster claws and vegetables in a light cream gravy. While tasty and unique, my companion didn't like the inordinate amount of corn in the pie. My other companion and I both ordered the grilled lamb. This was a \"deconstructed\" meal meaning that it was a la carte and sides were separate. The lamb looked and smelled delicious but the eating the meal had overtones of completing a decathlon. The meat was laced with fat and gristle throughout and the sinewy texture made it near impossible to chew thoroughly. When a tender piece was found it was delicious immersed in the accompanying red wine sauce.  the three of us shared two side dishes - the asparagus and a \"to die for\" lobster macaroni and cheese, though pricey at $17.50. \n\nWe each had a glass of house wine and had no room for dessert. Certainly, for two of us we had no energy in our jaws to eat or chew further. \n\nWe approached Kasey, our server and detailed the difficulties with our main course. She promptly approached the Manager who quickly and without fuss deducted the price of both lamb dishes from the bill. Without the deduction, the bill was $183. \n\nOverall, considering the ambiance, high quality of service and high quality of food, despite our run in with the lamb, we will return on another visit to Las Vegas. The management at Table 10 obviously believe in customer service."

It worked awesome with the cocktail.\n\nFor appetizers we tried the Seafood Creole Bouillabaisse and another appetizer which was on a special menu for the day. Both tasted fabulous.\nMain entrees: we tried the Grilled Rib-eye steak with lobster scampi, Carnitas Po-boy, Creole Crawfish \"boil\" Pasta, and i gotta say, it was blown away by the taste and the food quality. The steak has to be one of the best steaks Ive ever tried! It went perfectly with the lobster and the lemony dressing.  The pasta had some jumbo prawns and house made sausage just took Pasta to another level. Carnitas po-boy had a really tasty marination and lil pieces of fried zucinni on the side. YUM!\n\nThis place really earned its way into one of my favorite restaurants! Rite on!"

This truffled mac and cheese has rivaled some of the best, from NY to LA. I thought the best one I had was at Cafeteria in NY, but this place for some reason tastes better, maybe they use more truffle or perhaps the cheese just tastes better.\n\nAnytime I am craving mac and cheese in vegas, I think of this place. The decor is nice and all of emerils signed chef's outfits are on display. Great job Emeril!"

From the inflexibility of the tasting menu, to the utter inedible quality of some of the food we got, this place was the most uninspired and underwhelming I've had in Vegas.  Sure my expectations are high, but no doubt Emeril would be appalled by the quality of the food we had.  I won't ramble on about it,  but the bright lighting, the bad radio music playing in the room clashing with the mall music playing in the mall of Treasure Island, this place needs to go away and start again."

And the atmosphere is friendly and inviting; upscale American bistro.\n\nAs a grinder, the Venetian poker room is a second home.  That said, there is a limit to the amount of food court food I can take.  Table 10 offers an unpretentious (poker players dress code is jeans, tshirts, and hoody), well priced, delicious dining alternative.\n\nFor starters, the roasted bone marrow is outstanding.  Creamy and melt in your mouth delicious.  Perfect on the toasted brioche.  The braised beef cheeks; fork tender, deep flavor throughout and so perfect with the wild mushrooms and fava beans.\n\nToo \"Silence of the Lambs\"?  For lunch, the rotisserie rib eye sandwich is hard to pass up.  One of the best steak sandwiches anywhere.  Thin slices of delicious rib eye topped with grilled portobello mushrooms, horseradish aioli and fresh peppery arugula.\n\nFinally, the roasted suckling pig porchetta is to die for.  Suckling succulence!  Moist, delicious fattiness surrounded by a garlic sauce that packs huge garlic flavor bringing out the incredible sweetness of the pork.\n\nService is very good (can be extremely efficient if you let them know you are under a time constraint like a dinner break in a tourney).\n\nWine list is well chosen.  Prices are fair by Vegas standards.\n\nRecommended."

I came here with my family of 14 on Sunday to celebrate my niece's birthday. The place wasn't crowded at all but they had to wait until everyone showed up before seating us. \nWhen I looked at the menu, nothing really stood out to me that I really wanted. Since I had a very late lunch I wasn't all that hungry anyways. I ordered the roasted butternut squash. I tried to request to omit the better, but the waiter told me that it was pre roasted, which means by the time I ate it, it was either microwaved or reheated. However, it was good, but something I could have made at home and save $10.\nMy husband ordered calamari and it was something he could have got at the Cheesecake Factory for 1/2 the price. The rest of the family order some other dishes (too much to list). My sister didn't enjoy the food at all. Asteria in Burglingame,CA was better. \nSo we left very disappointed. In fact, one of my sister and nephew had to order room service a couple of hours later due to hunger.\nI will try my best not to go to another Emeril;'s resturant again. Both time I spent a lot of money and left very disappointed.\n\nPROS:\n-clean place\n\nCONS:\n-service was slow considering the resturant wasn't busy. We kept on having to ask for more water. Our food nearly took an hour to arrive. We almost got up and left.\n-food didn't worth the price\n-DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT order the truffle mac n cheese. It was disgusting. It tasted like throw-up.\n-The cream of spinach was lacking flavor."

Everything was perfect from the hostess, to the waiters to the food.  \n\nCame here with my husband for our anniversry dinner.  Upon being seared we were given two bruschetta toasts as a gift from the chef for our anniversarym. They were cery good.  Both of us opted for the Taste of Table 10 4 Coursw menu for $48 each.  I choose the Boston lettuce salad, mushroom gnocchi, skate wing and warm chocolate malassadas (little donuts). I loved each dish ore than the next.  The gnocchi were so good and the mushroom sauce with it was divine.  The skate wing was a new item for me and I really liked it!  salad was crisp and fresh with a great dressing.  The malassadas were superb!\n\nMy husband opted for the chicken and andouille gumbo, bbq shrimp, wild salmon and banana cream pie.  The gumbo was to die for and the best that I have ever tasted.  I would expect nothing less from an Emeril restaurant.  BBQ shrimp were perfect as was the salmon and banana cream pie.  \n\nThe restaurant is immaculate and waiters and eager to please and made us feel welcomed.  I will definitely visit here again!!"

There was no wait for a table and the menu looked relatively good so we decided to give it a try.\n\nWhen we went to ask for a table the hostess was looking down and did not acknowledge me standing there until I said \"Hello\" then she looked up from the screen and greeted us. We were seated immediately which was nice and our server immediately came over and took our drink orders. We had our drinks with in a few minutes which was nice and fast.\n\nThe menu looked great everything looked so good I just wanted to try it all. I ended up choosing the smokey mushroom pasta while my one of my other friends ordered the Chicken breast sandwich. There were more people in my group I just cannot remember what they all ordered. We were a group of 7 all together. Our food took longer then expected to receive considering there were not many other people in the restaurant and no other group larger than three were in there. It took 28 minutes to receive our orders. \n\nThe food itself presentation wise was great. Flavor wise it was good, not great nothing to rave about. I have had some better mushroom pasta back where I am from at an Italian restaurant in Long Beach CA. My friends were satisfied with their meals but again, nothing to rave about.\n\nThe servers were nice and friendly but lacked attentiveness. On a couple occasions we ran out of water, waited for a few minutes (about 8 to 10) for a server to check in on us so I could ask but that never happened. I ended up just walking back over to the hostess and asked her to relay it to our server. She apologized for it and immediately went to the back to get us our server. \n\nThe decor in the restaurant is really nice and appealing the overall ascetic of it is welcoming. \nIn the end I probably would not return due to the fact that the food was nothing to brag about but I am happy we gave it a try and would say it's worth trying out if you don't mind spending a little bit more on a meal."

The ambiance is dark and sultry.  It was nice to be seated at a table that could have easily fit 2 more people.  We actually 2 people servicing our table for the entire dinner and they were fantastic and on the ball!!  To start I ordered a spinach salad with goat cheese which was served with a whole bulb of roasted garlic. 3 words:  UH-MAAAAAAHHH-ZING!! loved the garlic it was served with.  The table also ended up splitting Lobster mac n cheese which was to die for!!  i don't even like lobster but it wasn't too sweet and the mac n cheese was extremely creamy and the dish wasn't too rich.  For my main course I had the linguine with clams and bacon...SUPER DELISH!!  it was a thick cut bacon with a white wine sauce that had just the right texture and consistency.  Sometimes they can be watery but not this one!!  We had a trio of desserts including coconut cheesecake, bananas foster and some kind of donuts filled with cream.  I don't even like coconut but the cheesecake was DE-LISH-SHUS and those donuts were ON POINT!!  Was not a huge fan of the bananas foster which is usually NOT the case but the other desserts made up for it!!\n\nI WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT based off of my experience.

Likewise, the bbq shrimp were very delicious as well. They only come with three though, so don't expect to be sharing these. The bbq sauce was almost like a mole sauce. A little dark and caramel colored. Maybe a hint of peanut butter. Not sure, I'm just guessing. It was good though. Nothing bad to say about the fillet. It was perfectly cooked to my liking. Pretty much rare. I had the chicken corn chowder and thought it was pretty good. And for dessert, I had the banana cream pie. That was excellent. Loads of bananas. One recommendation I would say is I wish they had given us a plastic fork in our to-go box. Sadly at 3AM when you want to eat the leftover lobster mac-n-cheese, hotel rooms don't really have forks available. I almost called room service, but I didn't want to be \"that guy\" who called room service for a fork at 3AM."

Table 10 is located in the shop area of the Palazzo and I really wanted to try it. Luckily, my girlfriend and her family indulged me with this little request and we did.\n\nOur waiter was a little off, but I'm giving him a pass because the rest of the experience was great. Maybe he had a tough night or something, but we were there for lunch and not sure he wanted to be. That being said, onto the food.\n\nWe decided to go family style and ordered a few of the New Orleans Fried Shrimp po'Boy's ($16). They were quite tasty the shrimp was fried to perfection, with a wonderful Creole mayonnaise, very similar to Lagasse's Stadium, but even better. They were also served with tasty, fresh cut fries that were devoured quite quickly.\n\nWe also got the La Quercia Prosciutto Panino ($15). It contained mozzarella, roasted heirloom tomatoes, balsamic vinaigrette and a garden green salad. It was a very tasty sandwich, think high caliber grilled cheese with tomatoes. It would've been nice if the tomatoes were chopped as I felt it needed a little more consistency throughout the sandwich. Quite tasty though. The salad was extremely fresh and tasty. \n\nThe last shared item was the Kurobuta Baby Back Rotisserie Ribs with a pickled corn salad ($25). There was enough for the whole table to eat. It was a huge portion. The ribs had a great sweetness to them that worked perfectly. It was a whole rack, and the meat just fell off the bone. I've been a little over ribs for a while now, but this brought me back for at least another try.\n\nIf you want a great restaurant with great food done with Louisiana love, this is the place."

            "review": "Visiting Las Vegas from the Gulf Coast for a convention, my companion and I bee-lined to the first sit down restaurant we could find.  It just happened to be Table 10.  I was slightly disappointed when we were seated and I realized that this was one of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants though - not because I have anything against him or his food, but because I didn't come from the Gulf Coast to Vegas to eat more Gulf Coast fare.  But at least Emeril always puts a unique spin on his dishes.\n\nMy friend and I walked in without looking at the menu or the prices, and I for one was a bit put off by how much the food costs - at least $30 per entr\u00e9e.  I think my friend was too, because we ended up just getting a bunch of appetizers (a more reasonable $8-15 per plate) and sharing tapas style.  \n\nWe got the mussels, calamari, bacon, and their special snack of the day, potato chips.  The chips were just kettle chips with Parmesan on them.  The calamari was underwhelming.  The mussels were delicious.  But the hands down best (and surprisingly cheapest) dish was the bacon.  \n\nThe bacon was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  It came with a brown sugar dipping sauce.  Perfectly fried, crispy, crunchy, chewy in all the right ways... and for the price you get surprisingly a lot of it.  \n\nIt should come as no surprise that one of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants ranks high for fine dining.  Just be aware that you're paying for the brand name just as much as the quality of the food.  While the price may be arguably worth it, when you're in Vegas, there are many more ways to blow your money than on food."

I had the Boston  salad which said it came with Boston lettuce, bacon, chive buttermilk ranch dressing and heirloom radishes. I got excited because I love radishes and had never heard of \"heirloom\" radishes alas it was misprint on menu because salad came with tomato instead of radishes! Lol salad was good and way too big. \nFor my entree had the gnocchi which was excellent. The mushrooms were the best I ever had. I asked waiter what kind they were because on menu it just said spring.   \nWaiter looked at my plate and said \"well looks like maybe a portobello. The chef just throws in whatever is fresh.\" So I guess I will never know what the best mushrooms I have ever had truly are! Lol"

I mean...really...overpriced.\n\nThe ambiance is a tad dark and romantic on the interior with a pretty cool glass partitioned room filled with wine dividing two dining areas.  I think if I were to eat here again, i'd request a seat inside.  We sat out on the patio...if you can call it that...more of a gated off section in the mall area of the Palazzo.  It was bright, loud, but great for people watching...I give it that!\n\nThe service is FANTASTIC...they give you three servers per table and when the food comes out, it ALL comes out...in one swoop.  So no waiting for your honey's plate to come out while yours sits there in front of you cooling off...THAT, I like!\n\nAs for the food, have to say, quite impressive but not for the cost.  We started with the escargot which was served up inside what appeared to be fried potato skins with a wine demi-glaze of sorts.  Divine flavor...the perfect blend of sweet and sultry.\n\nEntrees...mom had the sea scallops which, if you like scallops, were pretty good.  They were served up in a bowl in some sort of corn and sweet tomato sauce.  I had the filet with the add-on of lump crab and chive butter and my honey had the lamb atop mashed potatoes. And funny thing, looking at the menu from their site now...NONE of the things we ate are even on there aside of the snails!  What the?  Most of the items I see on their online menu are less expensive than what we ate...\n\nMy filet alone (thanks mom for paying for dinner by the way!  whew...) was $38...for JUST the steak!  The crab add-on was another $15!!  And no veggie.  Just the beef and shellfish...$53.  Like I said...OVERPRICED.  Excellent but not worth the cost...The lamb on the menu is listed as $27 but when we had it...$38.  You would think in a recession that they'd LOWER, not RAISE the cost.\n\nFor desert...we had a trio of dishes.  I had the blueberry bread pudding with lemon and caramel sauce, mom had the chocolate malted creme brulet, and the honey had these little donut thingies which were essentially balls of white chocolate wrapped up in a donut hole and then deep fried.  Yuuuuuuum.\n\nOverall...lovely meal but I won't be hitting up the place any time soon seeing as i'm unemployed. :(  I'd suggest saving up and splurging here or just taking your business to another establishment where you might get a little more for your $."

In the mid-90's, I can recall sitting down at my television set, waiting enthusiastically for your television show to come on.  I watched it religiously and learned much about cooking--good cooking--from your show.  \n\nSo, when I recently visited Las Vegas and was looking for a final lunch before heading to the airport, I was pleased to have stumbled upon Table 10, and was even more pleased to learn the restaurant served lunch.  I was thrilled--really thrilled.  I sat down at the bar and asked the friendly bartender about his favorites on the menu.  The first thing out of his mouth was the chicken sandwich.  I said, \"Sure, let's do it.\" I ordered a tasty cocktail and waited anxiously for the meal/lunch to arrive.  \n\nWhat did the sandwich look like upon arrival?  Great.  Stunning!  The visual presentation was spot on.\n\nWith mouth watering and a smile on my face, I picked up half of the sandwich and leaned in for the first bite.  \n\nThe result?  Simply put, the texture of the bread was wonderful.  It was a pillowy ciabatta.  I then caught the taste of the chicken as I continued my bite.  It was perfectly seasoned, with just the right amount of salt and spices.  For a split second, I was in heaven.  \n\nThen, I hit the chicken.  Or should I say my teeth hit the chicken.  Initially, I thought I had bitten into a toothpick or some other hard object.  I was stunned to learn I had not.  It was the texture of the chicken!  Tough, leathery--almost jerky-like--I had to grind through each bite of the chicken pieces until I finished the sandwich.  \n\nShould I have gone no further than bite one and just simply sent it back? I suppose I could have done that, but it's not my job to demand that I be served a quality sandwich.  Rather, it's the kitchen's job to nail it on the first try.  \n\nThe kitchen served me the sandwich I got.  I ate it.  It was truly disappointing, as I've admired your work as a culinary giant for many years.  It was almost a great sandwich, but for the chicken.  \n\nRegards, Tom D."

For the first course, I went with the chicken and Andouille sausage gumbo.  This is Emeril's place so why go with a salad.  The gumbo also had steamed rice in it and my server added freshly ground pepper to my liking.  When I first tasted the gumbo, I thought that it needed something more to kick it up a notch.  I almost asked for some hot sauce but I thought that might be like asking for a salt shaker at Jo\u00ebl Robuchon.  As I ate the gumbo, the spiciness started to kick in.  The spice was there.  It showed itself fully as you ate more of the gumbo.\n\nFor the main course, I chose the the pea tortellini.  This menu describes it as sweet pea tortellini with handmade pasta, pea shoots, Romano cheese, mascarpone and lemon oil.  It was really a flavorful dish and just the right amount for lunch considering dessert was yet to come.\n\nFor dessert, you can choose any of the desserts on the menu.  I went with the specialty of the house, the banana cream pie.  It was excellent.  A tall slice of goodness with layers of large, whole chucks of banana with seams of cream.  It's like a block wall of banana with cream holding the blocks in place.  It was excellent!\n\nService was good.  There weren't a whole lot of people here, but it appeared like one server was covering the lunch crowd except for the people sitting at the bar.\n\nA solid Restaurant Week selection!"

We definitely had no complaints on service whatsoever.\n\nMy husband ordered the Jambalaya and loved it.  I ordered lemon & herb marinated free range chicken.  The chicken had a wonderfully fresh lemon flavor.  My only complaint was that as I got to the end of my meal, I noticed that part of the chicken was undercooked.  I was full, and didn't really want to eat anymore so I didn't bother to send it back.\n\nI would go back and would recommend this place, but I would definitely not order chicken again."

Love when you can see into the kitchen and the wine rack is HUGE!\nWe started off with red and white sangria. Both were VERY tasty! I couldn't resist and ordered 2!\n\nFor food we ordered lobster mac & cheese, bbq shrimp, popcorn shrimp, a andouille link platter, and Emeril's gumbo! \nThe dish that stood out the most was most definitely the lobster mac! My, my, my!!!! We were supposed to be sharing it but I couldn't resist hogging it like my own lol! Full of lobster chunks and delicious cheesy penne noodles! Crazy thing is I didn't even order it lol! I ordered the least favorable dish, the gumbo! I was kinda surprised it wasn't better but it wasn't bad either. I expected a bit more flavor and maybe a little kick in the spice department.\n\nThe popcorn shrimp were actually a good size. Crispy, fried shrimp, served with a delicious mustard! There was more than enough to share amongst 3 people but I ended up scarfing that down as well lol! \nThe bbq shrimp were tasty but not knock your socks off amazing. They were 3 large battered shrimp in a semi sweet bbq sauce.\n\nThe andouille platter surprised me! Im not a huge fan of sausage on its own but this was delicious! It was accompanied by a creole mustard, bread, and SUPER tangy/sweet pickles. Definitely worth $9 to try!\n\nThe appetizer portions are worth the money, drinks are delicious, and service was great! I can't wait to return to Vegas!"

Table 10 and Delmonico's are two of our favorite in Las Vegas. \n\nWe tried the fixed price menu, which was an excellent choice because they provide several great choices for each course. 1st course - we tried the salad and the chicken & andouille sausage gumbo. The gumbo was off the charts. Good thing it was a smaller portion or would have filled up on it. 2nd course - we both tried the candied bacon. Oh my was this good. Several thick cut pieces of farm raised bacon with maple syrup- must try. 3rd course - we both tried the 6 oz. Filet Mignon that were cooked to perfection and very tender and tasty. 4th course - raspberry panna cotta was great as well. \n\nAll for under $50 per person, which is great in LV for dinner."

This was our first visit to Table 10.\n\nLocation: \nOne of Emeril's restaurants... this one is upstairs in the shopping area of The Palazzo next to Sushi Samba.\n\nAmbiance: 3.5 stars better than 'OK' but not super great\nDark woods, low lighting, modern, but not kitchy. What I thought was a bit odd... not that their patrons look up much and stare at the ceiling... was that the ceiling was a wire/mesh where you could see through it to the pipes and ducts and stuff that run through the ceiling.  I thought it seemed a little too industrial in that respect.  But it did not detract from the meal or enjoying an evening out.\n\nBar Area: 4 stars for looking nice\nCircular with tall, high-backed stools.  Looked like a cool place to hang out.  There were a few TVs so if you were in the mood to watch a game and chill.\n\nWine Menu: 4 stars for selection\nExtensive.... Good selection of California, French and some Australian and South American wines.  Some are quite expensive and others are not so bad.  Figure 2x to 3x retail.\nWe enjoyed the Nickel and Nickel Truchard Vineyard Carneros Chardonnay.\n\nService: 4 stars\nAttentive and nice, but nothing special.  They refilled our water and wine glasses without us asking.  \n\nBread: 3 stars\nThey serve each person one warm roll.... (not a basket)... so that was good so that you don't fill up on bread.  (I think you can ask for more... I did not.)  The roll was pretty good... but I would have preferred it a bit crustier on the outside... with the inside nice and soft just like it was.\n\nAppetizer: 3 stars\nArtichoke - crispy/fried... good ... not super spectacular but it was a nice appetizer to start off ... portion was good for 2 people.\n\nSalad: 4 stars\nI ordered the Spinach salad which came with goat cheese, roasted head of garlic, marinated red onion slices and a crostini.  I thought this was Excellent.  The spinach was super fresh and green... not wilted or brown.  The dressing was light and not too much.  The roasted garlic was messy to deal with because you had to pick the cloves out of the head... but I managed.  The red onion slices were on the sweet and tasty (and I don't like onions and normally don't even eat them).\nThe husband ordered the caprese salad which was presented very nicely.  I didn't try it but he said it was very good.\n\nMain Entr\u00e9e: 3 stars\nI ordered the Diver Sea Scallops.  The description said it was served with a chimichurri sauce and that's why I ordered it.  Honestly... it was all butter..I didn't taste any chimichurri.  If you like butter... you'll love this dish.  To me, it was dripping in butter and everything tasted like butter.  I thought the scallops were well prepared and were moist and tender...not gritty at all like they sometimes can be.\n\nThe husband ordered the Fish of the Day - Salmon.  It was supposed to be served Med Rare... it came out more Med-Med Well.  I got a taste.... It was good but not something we'd order again.\n\nDessert: 2 stars\nBananas Foster - big disappointment.  \nThe server recommended this item saying it was the best thing on the menu... if that was the best... YIKES! Not only did they NOT do this table side .... The bananas weren't carmelized like I expected them to be.  And the rum sauce they poured over the bananas and ice cream was straight rum and sugar... way too sweet and overpowering. I personally like the BF at Ruth's Chris much better.... They do it table side and it's AWESOME there.\n\nOverall:\nI'll probably go back to have a drink and hang at the bar if I'm in the area... not sure that I'd go back for dinner again. Too many places in town to try."

I usually have a glass of very reasonably priced white wine, the scallop special (whatever it may be) and gumbo, but I've tried many things on the menu.\n\nI think this place has the best scallops ever, and I'm not even a big scallop fan. They're perfectly cooked and always amazing. The bread is to die for, and I really like the mosaic tables and the overall sultry vibe of the place. \n\nService is great and the crowd is diverse. I tried the lobster dome thing, but think it is overpriced and overhyped. The pastas are so-so for me as well, but everything else that I've had is great. Try the s'mores dessert!, oh and did I mention the scallops!?"

You're essentially sitting in a mall, whether you're sitting in the \"outdoor\" indoor space, or \"inside the gates\".\n\nThe service was attentive and friendly.\n\nThe boston lettuce salad with chive buttermilk dressing was good -- although, ironically (for all the bitching Emeril does on Top Chef about lack of seasoning) there was virtually no seasoning in the dressing or on the salad.  After adding salt and pepper, it was a lovely salad with heirloom radishes and bacon ... although there could have been more of both.\n\nMy husband very much enjoyed his margarita pizza.  Great crust and flavorful and fresh tomato sauce with quality cheese.\n\nThe chicken and andouille sausage gumbo was the best I've had (I have not been to NOLA).  The rice was perfectly cooked and a perfect amount of it.  The \"gravy\" was dark brown, spicy, and had a perfect medium body texture to it.  Yum ... I'd eat that every day!\n\nI'd say to skip the banana cream pie -- too many thick sliced bananas, cream was too thick, and whipped cream on top was flavorless.  Can't hold a candle to Tom Douglas's coconut cream pie ... now, THAT is a cream pie!"

Unfortunately, the pork po boy was very pedestrian, which was a huge disappointment from an Emeril restaurant. The sandwich really lacked flavor altogether. And fries that came with it were just fries...perhaps my expectations were a bit high, but for a $30+ for an app & a sandwich (no booze), the bang for the buck was low.  Although, the beef cheeks alone were 5 stars, but the po boy & price really zapped the overall rating. Service was great."

Wine selection by the glass was minimal, but at least there was some international flavor. \n\nI had the beef tartar to start which was garnished on the side with tasteless capers, dry egg, onion and chives. Served with baguette cracker from out of a box you could get at the supermarket - I was not overwhelmed. \n\nFollowed this I had the pasta in a nice tasting sauce, fired corn, spring onions, a few crawfish tails, spicy andouille sausage and with 4 decent shrimp that was overall just slightly above average, with the shrimp stealing the show.\n\nOverall way over priced for what you get but that seems to be the theme in Vegas.

After getting the call and heading back to be seated - I was ignored from the same host and manager-like guy in a suit. Finally had to ask if they were ready for me or not, the host tells me to hold on and continues to seat 2 parties behind me. At this point, I'm getting frustrated and finally ask the manager-like guy to be seated, he brushes off my frustration and seats me closest to the front entrance - not the best spot for sure... seriously.\n\nMy server and her partner were pleasant and attentive, which made me reconsider staying versus leaving for a different restaurant. I order the \"Tasting Menu\", not a bad price for the options and portion sizes.  I ordered the Halibut, which is nicely presented on fennel spiced veggies - BUT half way into the filet... I smell an extremely strong ammonia odor. The first few bites were fine, maybe because the fennel spices are a bit powerful. But once I got to the thickest part of the fish, I had to stop dead in my tracks. Horrible!!!!\n\nThe manager-like guys comes over to check in on me and I tell him about the fish. He asks if I'd like to replace it and I tell him that I really wanted the fish - but was worried that the next filet might have the same ammonia smell. He says \"we don't treat the fish, so maybe it will\". WOW... Really? He offers another entr\u00e9e and I settle for the Short Rib... it was pretty good.\n\nNow I'm interested in why my dinner smelled like Windex, so while waiting for the Short Rib... I Google it. And I find that the smell of ammonia is an indicator of decaying, rotting fish. No way!!! I just ate half of a rotted piece of Halibut. After 2 bites of the Short Rib, I'm totally done with Table 10.\n\nThe overall service, quality of food and experience - not really worth it. There are tons of other options in Restaurant Row... better service and food for sure."

The good news is that most people eat dinner super late on the strip, so we had no trouble getting a table at a normal dinner hour (around 6:00 P.M.).\n\nService was a bit slow at first but then got better.  They were not busy, so I'm not sure what the problem was.  I'd say we waited a good ten minutes to order drinks.  After that there was a dramatic improvement.\n\nI have mixed reviews to offer on the food.  I expected a better cocktail sauce to be served with the oysters.  In fact, we had much better oysters at a more reasonable price the next day at the Palace (right off the strip).  My husband's salmon was out of this world excellent--the best I've ever tasted.  On the other hand, my gumbo was nothing special.  That disappointed me, because of Emeri'ls BAM thing.  My gumbo definitely lacked the BAM factor.  Thankfully, I was saved by dessert.  We ordered and scarfed down the White Chocolate Malassadas, which are little donuts with white chocolate on the inside and cinnamon sprinkled on the outside.  Oh . . . my . . .God!!!!  Yes, they were THAT good."

            "review": "Okay, my last lunch at Table 10 was probably 4 stars rather than 5.  But my 5 star rating is sort of a lifetime achievement award, based on many meals at Emeril's restaurants in New Orleans and Las Vegas.  In addition to his winning personality on TV, Emeril Lagasse is one hell of a restauranteur.  If you eat at any of Emeril's restaurants, you can count on a first class meal; and the prices are not too bad for a high end restaurant.\n\nI think it's fair to judge Table 10 based on my overall affection for Emeril, because it is an overall showcase for his New Orleans cuisine.  At restaurants like this, I like to order several appetizers and small plates, rather than an entree.  I mean, look, a great steak is a great steak, and there are a lot of places to get one.  But if you want to enjoy Emeril's special talents, try a few things that you can't get at the steakhouse down the street.\n\nFor my last lunch I started with the bacon wrapped dates.  This seems to be a new in-fashion thing, as I just had the same dish down the street at Giada's.  The dates were great at both places, but I don't remember seeing dates on many menus over the last several years.  Plus ca change...  \n\nNext I had the chicken and sausage gumbo.  Not astounding, but quite good.  Same for the lobster mac & cheese (which is a side dish).  My wife enjoyed her shrimp po' boy - a hefty sandwich which she could not finish at one sitting.\n\nOne bad point - Table 10 is buried in the maze of the \"canal\" shopping center between the \nVenetian and the Palazzo hotels.  As a place to wander and shop, the canal is pretty cool.  I remember liking it the first time I was there.  But if you are headed for a destination in there, it is a bit of a pain in the butt.  The place is designed to walk you past as many high-end stores as possible.  I'm not certain if there is a minotaur wandering around in there (it wouldn't surprise me), but the mythical labyrinth has nothing on the trek from the parking lot to Table 10, and has the advantage of avoiding the crowds.\n\nOnce you get to Table 10, though, the restaurant is comfortable and the service is friendly and attentive.  Except for the nagging thought that you are going to have to find your way back to the parking lot, with multiple wrong turns and elevator rides along the way, I think you will really enjoy your meal."

Dark, sexy, mosaic tables in patterns that matched the backs of the bench lining the walls - and 10 of Emeril's chef jackets on display, and a bar in the middle. I can see how this would be great dining alone, which I enjoy.\nThe bread was I think the most delicious part of our meal. It was like a brioche with a salt herb crust line across, served warm.\nThe gumbo was tasty and rich, and they let us split it.\nI ordered the scallops as an entree - it was very good. T hated his crawfish boil pasta - which was ok - but underwhelming for what we thought an Emeril dish should taste like. He's a dude and not a foodie and he didn't think much of it. He didn't even eat half of it. The truffle mac and cheese was meh - maybe it was the penne when we expected macaroni - shape matters. If you call it mac - it should be mac. We didn't eat half of that either and didn't take it to go. We skipped dessert.\nThe service was great.\nI would come back again maybe to try the dinner menu which might be more sexy. 3.25"

Oh Mr. Emeril, you would have been sad to have tasted what your kitchen pulled together for our Thanksgiving dinner.  \n\nAppetizers were strong!  My daughter ordered the Candied North Country Bacon which were addicting.  My husband had the tried and true Chicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo and I started with a very refreshing, well-balanced Beet Salad.  We also really enjoyed the Sriracha Wings, nicely spiced and well prepared.\n\nThen....the entrees came....with disappointment!!!\nMy daughter ordered the Smokey Mushroom Pasta from the hot appetizer menu because that is more than a small child will eat. She only ate a little bit of ham bits which came on the dish. She told me that the pasta was plain, tasteless and oily. The pasta was overcooked and someone must have forgotten to season the water!  We also got the pork chop which had a mole sauce that went all over the caramelized sweet potato. The sweet potato would have tasted better if it had been served in a separate dish on the side.  The mole sauce though delicious with the pork chop, is not good with the sweet potato!  The roasted chicken should be removed from the menu because that was really gross and dry! The sauce & the mushroom tasted a bit stale and strange...\n\nWe loved eating at Delmonico's and had high hopes for Table 10.  If you have to eat here, save a whole lot of money and avoid the entrees!  Stick to some smaller plates and enjoy their fresh rolls with butter."

It's not a Vegas burger joint.  The set menu is a fantastic deal. My steak was perfection.  Candied bacon is great as were bacon wrapped dates. The location in the north part of the building means it sees less foot traffic than it could but it is worth the walk and SUBSTANTIALLY better than most other places you will eat at on the strip.

Over the summer I was able to attend a bachelorette in Vegas and the beautiful bride to be, some pretty ladies and myself had reservations here for dinner before going out to get into some trouble, I mean, have some fun. I decided to share my plate with one of the maids of honors. We ordered the:\n\n-Sake Braised Beef Short Ribs $35\nThe meat was tender and cooked to perfection. The short ribs were soooo tender that they were fall off the fork soft. The glaze over the short ribs was delicious and very savory. The plate comes with sweet potato puree which surprisingly wasn't too sweet for my taste and it had a few roasted garlics on the side which we all truly loved and didn't regret eating when we got to the club haha. The plate was big enough for myself and another girl to share without feeling too full or still hungry after the meal. I swear, the roasted garlic here is truly delicious and one of the best I've had. \n\n-Truffle mac and cheese $11\nThe truffle was good, I wish it was a bit more truffle-y though. The mac and cheese was still good though. Creamy, cheesy and a perfect side dish to add to the short ribs. You must try it.\n\nOur waiter was really nice and even brought the bride to be a dessert to congratulate her on her future marriage. He made us laugh a few times when we were joking about the check and was really sweet when making sure we all were satisfied with our meals. Needless to say, it was a great experience and a great way to start a celebration that weekend."

The candied bacon was a great novelty and I would recommend it. Beet salad was light and fresh.... not off the hook, but good. Loved the pistachios. Butternut squash lacked flavor and was rather doughy. Short Ribs were very good with a nice sauce and what appeared to be a sweet potato pur\u00e9e. The salmon with couscous was bland and undercooked. Trust me, we love sashimi and sushi. The entire dish lacked any flavor. My wife ate about a fourth of it. Believing that a restaurant can only improve if you are honest when they ask you how the food is, we let our server know when she asked. She offered to bring something else, we declined. Taking it off of the bill would have been the right move. The puff pastry filled with white chocolate and a wonderful dipping sauce, was great. All in all, come here for the bacon and the desert. I think these celebrity chefs open too many restaurants and they lose control over the quality. BAM! Once here was enough."

            "review": "(3.5 stars)\n\nTable 10 is located in The Palazzo and it is one of Emeril Lagasse's Las Vegas restaurants.  The restaurant sits in a little shopping/restaurant area of The Palazzo that is a good distance away from the casino.\n\nThe decor is eclectic but not over the top.  It is a dark space with mostly dark browns (hardwood floor, high bar stools, half booths, walls, etc.).  There are splashes of color though as well as prominent but not ghastly decoration.  The overhead light fixtures are modern and alternate in color (blues and yellows).  Lots of design throughout the room with patterns in the bar seat cushions and the backs of the booths.  Also, the table tops are decorated in multi-colored tiles.  Some metal decoration too including a wrought iron spiral staircase at the center of the bar, which I think heads to nowhere.\n\nThe complimentary bread was a brioche roll, which was pretty good.  The crust was not much of a crust--kind of like the crust of a normal dinner roll.  There was a pretty good soft and flavorful brioche center that went well with butter.\n\nI started with the Seared Maine Sea Scallops With Crispy Fried Leeks, Lobster Tail And Salsa Provencal.  Las Vegas restaurants tend to be very overpriced, but I felt they actually could have charged more for this dish.  For the price, there was a generous portion of seafood (scallops and lobster).  The quality was great too.  The scallops had a nice caramelized sear with a tender and moist inside (though the scallops were a little gritty).  The lobster was tender and sweet. \n\nThe fried leeks went great with the seafood.  They were very crisp, but they were not oily or greasy.  Good onion flavor.  The sauce was the base of the plate and it consisted of oil, tomato and olives (the olive flavor was very strong).  The sauce had a little bit of spice to it.  The sauce was not bad though not the best flavor and I did not think it complimented the dish (the seafood stood out fine by itself).\n\nMy entree was seared tuna on a crispy corn cake over a tomato confit base.  The tuna portion was small (though it was a lunch dish).  The tuna was good.  Nice sear on the outside with a rare center.  The crispy corn cake had a crunchy outside and a sweet corn center.  The tomato confit base was kind of like a warmed up salsa and I was not a big fan of it (the sauce really reminded me of a tomato sauce I had at Xiomara Melrose so maybe this cuisine/style is just not for me).  While the tuna was good and everything was cooked properly, the resulting flavors did not really go together that well.\n\nI think my disappointment with both sauces/flavors had a lot to due with how each dish had a flavor/ingredient that stood out too much--olive for the starter and tomato for the entree (and not necessarily the best flavor/representation of those ingredients).  It could just be a matter of preference.  They did use very good quality seafood ingredients so I could see how these dishes might appeal more to others.\n\nService was good.  The waiter was soft-spoken, polite and attentive.  Food came out at a good pace.\n\nI have never been to an Emeril Lagasse restaurant before so I do not know how this one stacks up to his other locations.  For lunch, the ingredients they use here are better than some of the other Vegas restaurants serving lunch in the same price range.  There are definitely some positives here and it might be worth trying if you are a fan of Emeril Lagasse (or are curious about his food).\n\nI walked here, but I imagine The Palazzo has complimentary valet and self-parking like other major Las Vegas hotels/casinos."

Upon arriving the restaurant was sort of empty but we decided to give it a shot anyway. First things first, FREE sangrias for checking in! A great start to a fabulous dinner. They were delicious and did the job.\n\nEverything on the menu sounded delicious but was pricey so I decided to get the cheapest meat item on the menu, The Stuffed, Whole Rodgers Farm Young Chicken for $26..which wasn't a problem because I love chicken. Group dinners are great because everyone orders something different and you get to sneak a taste off every plate.\n\nWe ordered 1 appetizer and 1 side: Sriracha Chicken Wings for $13 and Lobster Mac-N-Cheese for $19. Despite the fact that I can't handle spicy food the wings were a complete hit! They had a flavorful kick with just enough spice for me to enjoy it. Just as the menu says, sweet + heat, cucumber buttermilk, and pickled vegetables. Seriously finger licking good! The lobster mac-n-cheese was nice & creamy. I loved the crumbs on top, it gave the dish texture. Our only wish was that there was more lobster.\n\n3 men with a dish in each hand arrived to our table together and knelt and presented our food. It was very impressive. To my surprise my chicken was very delicious. The skin was thin and flavorful (I hate fatty skin) and the meat was juicy and just perfect. I loved that it was stuffed with potatoes and veggies.\n\nEveryone else ordered the following:\nKurobuta Baby Back Rotisserie Ribs $13 (2 orders, since it is considered an appetizer on the dinner menu)\nLinguine + Clams for $27\nFetticcini Portuguesa for $26\nWild Salmon for $32\nGreat Lakes Whitefish for $35\nAnd LOVED it!\n\nWe were so stuffed and satisfied by the time the dessert menu arrived we all shared the White Chocolate Malassadas which was a perfect ending to our night.\n\nThe service was as great as it gets! Our water was always refilled. Our waiter shared stories with us and had us laughing!\n\nMy aunt & uncle always stay at The Palazzo when in Vegas & were suprised they've never been here before but they said they'd definitely be back and same goes for me!!"

I hope the chefs in that restaurant (if not Emeril Lagasse himself) would do something about this for their customer's sake. \nI walked in at 7pm on Sat and the place is almost empty (should had taken that as a red flag).  The waitress was nice, but not with an enthusiastic personality you would expect from a celebrity chef's restaurant.  My friends and I pick a few dishes to share.  First disappointment, my friend's lobster bisque soup was lukewarm and watery.  Next the prosciutto pizza (I believe, from the daily special) is quite mediocre and was soaked with oil.  The deal killer, a white fish dish (I forgot what it was, also from the daily special), was completely overcooked as if it sat under a heat lamp for hours.  That dish makes me write this review as I have never seen such poorly executed dish at any restaurant let alone from a big-name restaurant like this.  I surprise the restaurant's kitchen manager even let that dish get out of the kitchen.  To me, if you server a very badly badly overcooked white fish in such restaurant, the kitchen manager might as well go work in a fast food restaurant.  Our last dish, braised veal cheeks, while more flavorful than previous dishes, was so salty that none of us could take a second bite.  \nOverall, I was quite pissed off by the fact that Emeril lets this kind of quality control issue happening in his restaurant."

The food is great of course and even more surprising to me were how amazing and creative the appetizers were. I got some varieties of cold crab on a small dish, with a great aioli sauce.

The fillet steaks we got were cooked to perfection and beautifully prepared in a large, clean, kinda open aired kitchen where you can watch the chefs do their magic. Definitely worth a try if your in Vegas."

The spinach salad was great, as were the bbq shrimp, but 4 average size shrimp for $20?  Probably the worst value on the strip, yeah they were awesome with a great bbq sauce but way overpriced for just 4.  \nThe seabass was very good as was the lamb shank.  Coming with sides included made it a fair value. The blueberry cobbler for desert was great!  \nWill probably come back, maybe for lunch this time."

We arrived 15 minutes or so past our reservation but it was no problem. We were seated immediately to our table. \n\nThe ambiance was light and calming. Their menu had a great selection and I had no problem selecting my entree. I ordered the Boneless Beef Short Ribs (sweet potato puree - cabbage au caramel - roasted garlic). The meat was so tender and cooked perfectly. I loved the sweet potato puree that the short ribs sat on top of. It was the perfect combination!\n\nWe also started with the Sriracha Chicken Wings. It came with a cucumber buttermilk sauce, which was kind of refreshing when dipped on the chicken wings. I would definitely order this appetizer again. \n\nOne of my friends ordered the Kurobuta Pork Rack (rotisserie roasted rack - Weiser Farm carrots - roasted garlic sauce - Anson Mills grits). When the waitress said it was HUGE, she was not lying. It can definitely feed 2. The pork was also tender and went perfectly with the accompanied sauce. \n\nI normally love to order Linguine + Clams (manila clams - NCF bacon - broccolini - chili flakes - garlic - white wine sauce) but I knew I wanted a meat dish. My sister ordered this but she couldn't even finish it. The white wine sauce was a great pairing and it was not overwhelming. \n\nI would definitely come back to try the other entrees, and I love that they have generous portions. Would love to try the desserts next time :)"

The bartender advised me that both are served during meals for well over double the $5 Happy Hour price.  He also let me sample both wines before pouring my glass (standard procedure here), which was a great surprise.  \n\nFor food, I indulged in the cheese plate and bucket of shrimp.  The cheese plate was devine!  The shrimp was delicious, but the cornmeal crust fell off when I dipped it in the cocktail sauce.  \n\nThe bartender was attentive and helpful.

My Bf had two bbq shrimp which were good, but really 2? Then the main was beef short ribs for him, and scallops for me. The chef who cooked on Sat March 5th should go on Hell's Kitchen to be yelled at by Ramsay... The scallops were rubber. \nThe desert- mine was a cream banana pie which was good, but my bf had a hair baked right into the torte.\nWhen he told the manager about: the manager responds: it happens we don't have robots working back there LOL. If you eat here, enjoy the hair you get as an appy. VERY DISAPPOINTED, the manager really should be fired.....  If the manager responded with a bit more class this review would not have been that bad.... I do not recommend this place."

Our server gave us real options based off the most popular dishes and his favorites. \n\nWe started with the candied bacon - so delicious. There's an amazing sweet bourbon sauce that they drizzle on the bacon that makes it sweet and savory at the same time. \n\nBEST beef short rib around. Fall of the fork tenderness and a rich sauce to pair. We also got the pork chop with roasted garlic sauce and buttery carrots. The size portion was such a great bang for your buck. THEN best part was the truffle mac and cheese. SUCH a lingering taste in your mouth hours afterward. So delicious. \n\nPlease go to Table 10. Great customer service, AMAZING FOOD. Thank you, Emeril Lagasse! BAM!!"

I've even been lucky enough to have him fix me something special when he was at Commander's Palace. That was a treat. Back to Table 10.\nWalking in, I felt like I was back in N'awlins. The decor is clean, classy and welcoming.\nService is spectacular! Attentive, polite, knowledgable, friendly. It doesn't get much better.\nOn to the food.\nRoasted Beef Marrow Bones were decadent, luxurious, mouth watering. Perfection.\nChicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo was awesome! An authentic Big Easy soup.\nEmeril's NOLA BBQ Shrimp were okay. A bit over cooked. \nCroque Madame was fantastic. Flavorful ham, eggs cooked perfectly. No brown edges, yolks thick and rich. So good... My mouth is watering.\nPork PoBoy was really tender, juicy, flavorful.\nTruffle Mac N Cheese was really good. A bit watery, but that didn't stop me!\n\nMy biggest thrill was the fact they serve Abita Beer and had Crystal Hot Sauce!!!!\n\nOnly thing missing was Bread Pudding. Com'on Emeril, It's a New Orleans based restaurant. Where  da bread puddin at?\n\nIf they would have had it, five stars."

We had the tasting menu since there were so many choices that sounded delicious and this was the best way to try more dishes.  It was a four course meal for $48/person which was a good price for a tasting menu.  \n\nSince we had a party of two, we both got different dishes and just shared everything so we got to eat 8 things on the menu.   Started with the bbq shrimp and tuna tartare, both were good but bbq shrimp is definitely the winner.  Next we had the candied bacon and the gumbo.  Wow to both!!!  I can just order this and be satisfied.   For the main entree we got the scallops and the braised short ribs, braised short ribs are the way to go, no knife needed just a quick movement of the fork and the meat just shreds apart and the sauce just the right amount of sweetness.  We were stuffed by dessert but ordered the banana cream pie and the white chocolate malassadas.   Not sure if I was just too full or it was just alright.  \n\nGreat service, awesome food and the mojito was excellent."

Since the main entrees were a little pricey, we opted to share some of the appetizers so that we could get a better taste of more dishes... for the 2 of us, we ended up ordering the gumbo, crab salad, margharita pizza, lobster Mac n cheese and BBQ ribs. My favorite was the Mac and cheese cooked to just the best temperature, cheesy heaven more lobster would have been good but overall satisfying! The ribs with pickled corn was also very good! Not too fatty or oily meat fell off the bone easily. Thecrab sale was also very fresh although it wasn't tossed well because some parts were extra salty.  The gumbo was ok had much better elsewhere.. The pizza was the worst, it was jusT WAY too oily, it was drenched in oil and the cheese was just barely melted, not browned. it was so oily i could only take a few bites :( wouldn't get that again .  The service was fine, ambience was great. Ncie and quiet."

Also, there were way too many people waiting on us than necessary. That said, I was really worried that the food might be crappy because we were on a rushed schedule. I was wrong! \n\nAppetizers: We ordered crab cakes and calamari. The calamari was good, but we were wondering where the sauce was till the waitress noticed, and brought it. By then we were ready for our main course and they were about 2 min away. The crab cakes were good, but you have to avoid the cream sauce surrounding it. The sauce just made the crab cake too heavy. \n\nMain course: Everyone loved their food. It was a table for 11, so we got a little of everything. I'll try to rehash what I can remember. \n\nWhen the food came out, I thought they looked a little small, but I didn't even finish my food! I had the Creole Spiced Mahi Mahi. Sooo good. The chorizo was a little too spicy, and I usually have a pretty good tolerance. Another girl at the table ordered the lobster dome, and it was good, but the cream tends to become too much after a while. Scallops were fantastic, no complaints there. The bone-in strip was cooked perfectly. The lemon & herb chicken was really good and the gnocci was delicious with the sweet corn. The duckling was huge, and fantastic. Slightly sweet but played off the marinade. The butternut squash reminded me of sweet potato fries. \n\nOh also, we got in just in time for the end of happy hour. Everyone loved the mojitos. Can't taste the rum, and the mint wasn't over powering. Some of us (ok, me) were double fisting. \n\nWe really enjoyed our meal and everyone agreed this was our best meal all weekend."

Plates are about $40-50 a person and sides come out to be around $10-20. We ordered the salt and pepper sea bass, lamb shank with pumpkin risotto, and dry aged rib eye. For a side, we went with the lobster mac and cheese.\n\nThere was a mixup in the kitchen, and the manager came to apologize for the long wait. To make up for it, he offered a couple of appetizers to keep our stomachs happy: a dungeness crab salad and grissini wrapped with prosciutto. Both were above my expectations and very delicious. I would order both the next time i'm here.\n\nWhen our entrees did make the table, we shared a bite of each dish and all agreed that the lamb shank was definitely the favorite. The meat fell off the bone easily like butter and the roasted garlic on the side intensified the flavors. The sea bass and brocolini were delicious as well. Being a steak-fan, there was nothing memorable about the rib-eye. However it was cooked perfectly and there was a nice crispy and butterfly crust. The lobster mac and cheese put a smile on all our faces as we tasted it. It came baked with a baked crust with large pieces of lobster floating in the creamy sauce.\n\nOverall I would come back again. The service is great, the people are friendly and the food was affordable and delicious. Though the food did come out late, the service made up for it with a smile, nice conversation and a couple of free appetizers. Definitely pleased when we left."

This review is strictly regarding dinner. \n\nMade reservations for 8 and arrived at 7:45, no problem, immediately seated. The bar area was about 40% filled and the dining area was 60% filled. We were immediately met by our server who took our water order and left us to decide on our cocktail order (easy for me-Sapphire martini, up extra dry with a twist!). The only hitch in the drink orders were mine arrived with olives (eww) and my girlfriend's pinot grigo took about 10 minutes to arrive. \n\nWe were given the \"chef's compliments\" small appetizer and munched on the wonderful bread and butter that was brought out. I could have just had the bread and been happy!\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Creole Spiced & Seared Hawaiian Mahi Mahi\nClams, Baja Shrimp, Chorizo Sausage & Lobster tossed in Piri Piri with Toasted Garlic Bread. In a word-amazing. The layer after layer of different flavors was incredible. Just as incredible was my Slow Roasted Prime Seaboard Farms Pork Tenderloin Fired Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Spiced Pecans and a Tart Cherry Reduction.\n\nWe ordered the grilled asparagus and the bacon & blue cheese Yukon potatoes. OMG...enough said there. \n\nAnd understand, these are LARGE portions. My girlfriend couldn't finish hers and I left a little on my plate also. We didn't have an appetizer because the desserts looked so good, but we simply didn't have room for any more.  \n\nThe prices: Her wine was $14 for a glass. My martinis (I had two) were $15.50 each. The meals were $33 and $34 respectively. So for around $130 we had great drinks, amazing food, outstanding service in a welcoming setting. What more could you ask for, right?"

            "review": "I don't like throwing down a FIVE star on a restaurant after just a single visit, but this visit was SO spectacular that I'm breaking my rule.  Oh, Emeril, I think I just fell in love with you.  Okay, maybe not you... but Table 10 is my new love in Vegas and I will be going back at first opportunity!\n\nHere's how it all happened.  My dad is a Grazie gold member at the Venetian and they offered him dinner for two at Table 10 as a part of his offer this week.  He could care less about food so he sent my mom and I to dine like queens in his stead.  THANK YOU DAD!!!!  Apparently, this offer is for a specific menu and I believe that this menu is available to order from otherwise, too, because it said at the top $75 for two people.  It's your standard Prix Fixe with three choices for each: appetizer, entree, and dessert, but I'm kicking myself because I don't remember all of the options on it, just what I selected!\n\nMy mom and I both made the same selections and we started with a tomato and burrata salad - what is not to like?  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  They also brought out pillowy soft dinner rolls that were so warm and delicious!  Our entree was tournedos of beef served over a potato puree with broccoli.  The beef was cooked PERFECTLY.  I asked for horseradish because I love horseradish with my steak and it was spicy and delicious.  The broccoli was crisp and fresh and the potato puree silky and tasty. We were also brought more rolls, oh YUM! But, the star of the night?  The pistachio cheesecake.  This is literally one of the best desserts I've had.  EVER.   The cheesecake was pistachio flavored on a chocolate crust with  whole pistachios on the plate.  It was served with vanilla ice cream.  It was the PERFECT combination of sweet and salty, crunchy and creamy.  I'm actually in love with a dessert!\n\nWe also ordered glasses of pinot grigio.  It was nice.  My only complaint is that I didn't check in on Yelp until we left and that was when I found out I could have gotten a free glass of sangria from my Yelp check in, if I would have checked in right when we got there since we had arrived just before happy hour ended at 7!  Ah, next time.\n\nOur server, whose name I do not recall - sorry, was awesome.  He was professional and attentive, but unobtrusive.  I felt well taken care of even though they knew we were there receiving the free dinner. Our water glasses were kept full and plates removed at the appropriate time and there were no lags between requests, deliveries, and clearing.  The service was outstanding.\n\nLiterally, I have NO complaints.  They even have their own restroom in the restaurant, which is unusual for a casino restaurant.  This was one of the nicest dinners I have enjoyed and I will highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who asks where they should eat in Las Vegas."

Flavor was good but for $4/shrimp, I expected a bit more BAM! \n\nAlso had the Truffle mushroom soup which was very rich. Couldn't finish the bowl because of how rich it was.\n\nHalibut with shrimp is a must. Perfectly cooked, flaky and full of flavor. Side of truffle mac and cheese was taste worthy but not a must have.\n\nWe went for dinner at 7 pm and only 2 other tables were seated. Good time to go on a Friday night. We didn't appreciate how close the tables were to each other. I could hear everything both parties were saying on either side of our table. It would have improved the atmosphere a lot more if we were a bit more spaced out.\n\nService was great. Never had an empty glass and our server's recommendations were right on. Thank you, Josh."

The truffle mac & cheese was what enticed me to make a reservation here, but it ended up being a let down.\n\nBut let me cover the good stuff first. Very friendly staff greeted us and were happy to seat us immediately, even though we were a little bit earlier than our reservation. The abundance of empty tables probably should have been a warning sign, but the sweet siren call of mac & cheese was blinding me.\n\nOur waiter was very prompt and attentive, and even the gentleman refilling water was kind and personable. The delivered fresh baked rolls which were nothing special. My friend got caught in the mac & cheese trap, too, but he ordered the version with lobster.\n\nWe were both totally underwhelmed. It was just some penne noodles in a cream based sauce, with some breadcrumbs trying to dress it up. I could see bits of truffle, but it added nothing to the taste. I had to pepper the crap out of it trying to make it taste like much of anything.\n\nSo three stars, based primarily on good service. Food alone would be a solid two star."

The guy next to us also had it and said it was perfect so we could have just had the one messed up rib eye... who knows. Also you have to pay for the sides and they are rather pricey... The rib eye came with just a few mushrooms, no potato or anything. Nothing really left of Emeril's famed Cajun food."

Made a reservations for a party of 8 Saturday afternoon for the same night and was able to get a table at 7:30pm, which led me to think this place is not crowded. Arrived at the restaurant and seated us outside the restaurant by the shopping area, which was nice. \n\nSince I can only speak for the dished I ordered, I'll rate my dishes only.  I started off with the Sauteed Escargot. The escargots were shelled and sauteed over some sort of garlic sauce, I was surprised how many escargots were there and the texture was slightly chewy, which they should be. It was good but not great maybe because there wasn't enough gaaaaarlic. Then I ordered the special of the day, Monkfish with sauteed Main Lobster, this dish was very good. The monkfish was very simple and tender and the lobster has a buttery flavor, however there were only like 4-5 little pieces of lobster meat. I did not order any dessert but i had a taste of my friends Kahlua creme brulee, it had a very strong espresso flavor and was very smooth.\n\nOverall, the service was subpar, food was good, price was a bit on the high side but expected, very friendly ambiance, and most of all I had a good meal with my friends."

Went to the bar and was promptly ignored for awhile.  Finally when opportunity arrived we each ordered red sangria ($6 each) and an order of fried eggplant and squash with oregano aioli. ($6 also). \n\n   Despite the most unfriendly waiter on the planet, we enjoyed our experience.  Sangria was refreshing...they take a couple ounces of red wine in a wine glass, then add a pre-soaked mixture that's at the bar to it.  The red is full of orange which I love.  The white one if you want that has a ton of pineapple in it.  \n   Our fried appetizer was simple and good.  Fried well.  Oregano aioli was good, but didn't taste like oregano.  (not necessarily a bad thing).\n   The only time our waiter smiled was when he handed us the bill.\n    I was soooooo excited to finally try Table 10.  During our time there we saw some folks eat great-looking chicken wings.  We also saw the same folks send back a raw looking burger.  (we saw several burgers come out but they weren't on either the regular dinner menu nor the happy hour menu that we looked at).\n   Glad to have had even a minimal experience here.  However, it was not enough to entice us to go back and spend lots of money."

I wanted to give Emeril another try - but I wasn't prepared to spend Delmonico money again.\n\nSo for lunch, we went to Table 10 on a Saturday.  The food was average or below average.  We enjoyed the rolls and butter. For a starter we shared the Gumbo which we both really liked. Mr. R had the Shrimp Po Boy and liked it - nothing too spicy and it was a good sized sandwich with lots of shrimp.  The fries appeared to be the same ones served at Red Robin - which is nice since we like Red Robin fries - but this food wasn't Red Robin prices!  I got a special of Risotto with watercress, lemon, and shrimp (3).  I am not a risotto expert, and I probably do overcook it at home - but the risotto was so undercooked and crunchy. I was biting down on hard little risotto nuggets all during lunch.  Ew.  \n\nThe service was disappointing.  We got what we needed and we were served our food, but our server was clearly grouchy and did not smile.  This guy did not like his job, did not like us, and possibly kicks puppies. I felt like we really inconvenienced him by eating lunch in his section.\n\nBlah - just not a good experience and not sure if Emeril and I can overcome this."

Just park at the Palazzo and take the elevators to the Canal Shoppes level to avoid the casino crowds. Take a short walk to Table 10 near the escalators to the casino floor. There's a greeter who will seat you. But my favorite thing to do is sit at the bar. Hopefully, Pedro will be at the bar. He knows his business. Because Emeril is a big fan of whiskey, specifically bourbon, there is a vast menu of whiskey, including scotch, rye, bourbon from around the world. Lagasse has New Orleans Fish House, Delmonico Steakhouse, Table 10 and Lagasse's Stadium in Las Vegas. If you want a fancy feel, quality food and mixology, without having to dress up, this place is for you. When shopping, gambling, or catching a show, Table 10 is a place that's easy to stop in and have delicious food. \n\nHaving tasted much of the lunch fare, I really enjoy the specialty drinks, whiskey exploring, and excellent sandwiches. Service has always been great. If anything is amiss, they'll fix it. The cheese plate, bacon wrapped dates, crab cakes, calamari, lamb gyro, BLT, Po' Boy, angus burger, and lobster roll have all been delicious. The french fries, lobster mac 'n cheese, and green bean fries are all good. We were given a slice of complimentary banana cream pie that was delicious and fresh."

This past weekend, I went to Las Vegas and after a show was debating where to go for dinner. It was down to Table 10 or the sushi place across the way, and the gf and I decided to go with the Nola flavor (and shorter wait) of an Emril establishment. It was the right choice. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice, very understated in comparison to the casino downstairs or the bright spectacle of some of the other celeb-chef places, and the music was low-key enough so that you could carry on a conversation with your table without yelling. The gf ordered the scallops and I ordered the beef special, and we both split a bottle of wine. The main dishes were good, though I also ordered a side of the truffle mac and cheese which stole the show. While good, we both agreed that we probably would've ordered a few of the more traditional small plates to split and consulted on the bottle of wine before ordering, but those are minor quibbles about what was a very pleasant experience."

The reception greeted us and said happy anniversary, and so were the two main waiters who served us.  That by itself, is very important.  They also gave us a few bite-size appetizer and lighted a candle on our dessert, it's all those details that made the experience special.\n\nWe also enjoyed the food very much.  We ordered the cream corn potato soup, it's very creamy and smooth, but what I liked was that it's not too rich.  Although I would prefer it to have a little bit more salt and maybe stronger bacon taste.\n\nWe also got the escargots as appetizer.  Wow, this was REALLY good!  Cooked pretty differently as well, with some kind of white sauce.  The mushroom was very tasty.  The overall dish was just very pronounced and special.  Loved it.  But again, could have used a little bit more salt.\n\nBefore I forgot, I also want to mention we loved the bread.  It's very different, a little bit sour, but so warm and so soft, it was heavenly!  If we really have to pick on it, it would be the fact that they serve the bread one by one.  So you will have to keep asking them for more.  \n\nFor entree, my wife got the salmon with vegetable.  Because she's pregnant she decided to get the salmon medium well, but they did recommend medium.  It came out a bit dry as expected (no choice), but the sauce was very good.  My wife still enjoyed the dish a lot and said if she got the medium, it would have been perfect.\n\nI got the buffalo with red wine glaze dish together with potato gratin.  They recommended medium or medium-rare and i opted for medium rare.  Thank god I did that.  The meat is so lean, anything more than medium rare I think is too dry already.  Very very different dish, it's not for everyone coz' it has very strong smell (much stronger than lamb), but it was great experience.  The red wine glaze was very good, works very well with the buffalo.  The potato gratin was perfect.\n\nFor dessert, we got the chocolate cake with raspberry sorbet, we both loved it.  The sorbet was some of the better ones we have had, not over powering, and together with the sweetness of the chocolate cake, they paired up very well!\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was very nice, we got seated in a pretty quiet area, but with some open seating, you can have big parties and still work very well.\n\nOverall we enjoyed our anniversary dinner very much, and given how diversified their dishes are, I am not surprised if we will come back soon again!"

This place got average reviews compared to the places around but I still gave it a chance.  \n\nTable for One. You'd think they'd sit me somewhere inside so I'd be comfortable.  No, they sit me outside against the fence so that everyone around can see I'm dining alone. I honestly don't mind dining alone but the positioning is so questionable.  \n\nI ordered the Seared Tuna over roasted brussel sprouts and butternut squash puree and miso honey sauce.  It was ok.  This wasn't the best seared tuna I've ever had.  Not even in top 10. The brussel sprouts were good but they were salty.  The butternut squash and miso honey sauce should've complemented it but they were sparse on the plate.  I like light dressing to dip the tuna in, but this was too light.  \n\nOverall, the yelp reviews are right on the target this time.  This place is just ok."

Don't bother buying the discounted voucher from tix4tonight because it doesn't work on this special and you will end up paying the same price for one entree as the 4 course special. Since I did buy the voucher, my fiance and I shared the 4 course meal and I also got a salad and truffle mac n cheese. The pre-fixe meal is honestly more than enough for 2 people so I recommend sharing if you're with one other person. The candied bacon, barbecue shrimp and filet mignon were incredible. The spinach salad was also delicious, but I've had beet truffle mac n cheese. Of course, you must try the banana cream pie, it's AMAZING! Even my fiance loved it and he doesn't like bananas.

We wanted somewhere nice but not exorbitant, and this place seemed like a good fit.\n\nI think all of us enjoyed our food, but none of us were blown away. I had the chicken, which was well-seasoned but a tiny bit on the dry side. Also ordered were the seafood stew (not as spicy as advertised), the salmon special, and the main pork entree (something stuffed with something else, if I remember correctly). We had a vegan in the group and the kitchen did their best to accommodate him with some fresh vegetable sides. The portions were all appropriate but not cartoonish--just the right amount, I'd say. We also all ordered salads. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese salad, which was very tasty. I especially loved the crostini that came with it--I wanted about 10 more of those. I also tried a bite of the beet salad, which was good.\n\nThe wine selection is excellent, and the wines by the glass are reasonable (10-14 or so). I had a delightful sauvignon blanc--really one of the better glasses of wine I've had in a restaurant.  I think everyone at our table had either wine or beer (they have an OK beer selection, but nothing fancy, and only bottles).\n\nNo desserts, so I can't comment on that.\n\nThe ambience is lovely, though I was surprised that there was no music playing. Eerily quiet. It also wasn't particularly crowded, and we were there on a Saturday between about 6 and 8.\n\nThe service was inconsistent--fast in the beginning, then slow before the entrees, and then slow again to pick up the check. \n\nThe whole thing came to something like $450 including tax and tip, which I viewed as pretty good for Vegas. Still, I'd try another place before I'd go back."

My lady had the Shrimp Po' Boy and that too looked great and filling.  Also enjoyed their Truffle Mac N Cheese.. Good flavor but a bit on the runny side.. still good. Only gripe was my lobster rolls. They came in looking like sliders.. 3 of them, almost in the same bread as they give in the beginning with about a tablespoon of lobster in each, so it gives the impression that you were shorted on the lobster. It was still good, just wish it had more lobster in it (Boy, do I miss their shrimp toast! That was Yum-ME!!).\n\nOverall, the experience there has always been good.

Unlike many tasting menus not everyone in the group has to do it (though we all it).

A taste of New Orleans, so pure with the right mild spices.   Did you eat your hot roll already? Don't worry just ask for another so you can wipe the bowl clean.\n\nMy second course was the Bbq shrimp.  The beautiful shrimp with a homemade Rosemary biscuit.  I recommend cutting/breaking up the biscuit so that as you eat the shrimp (savor each succulent bite) you can use the biscuit to sop up the bbq sauce on the plate.  Still sauce left...ask for another hot roll to leave a white plate.\n\nThird course...the entree: the Short ribs-these were so tender they melted in my mouth. On a bed of saut\u00e9ed kale and a beet and horseradish smeer.  The beet and horseradish with the short rib was the perfect complement.  The kale was a little moe challenging for me.  Was more like spinach and colored green sort of.  The first couple bites I was unsure but something was intriguing and I kept eating.  By the end I eat it all and could say I enjoyed it.  Was an earned win.\n\nDesert my folks had Emeril's famous banana pie.  They loved it.  Not really my thing so I had the Malassadas.  Kind of like a benign filled with melted white chocolate, rolled in cinnamon and sugar with a raspberry sauce.  This should not be legal.

A couple more pieces of vegetable and some type of pur\u00e9e would have added to the dish. \n\nMy mom had the crab cakes and the piri piri; the crab cakes had a nice taste to them but fell apart - I expected a bit more out of a restaurant quality crab cake.

We should've known then to run the other way. Our server had a helper working with her on this evening. We rarely ever saw either of them. Except when they were attending to a larger table next to us. And even then they wouldn't ask how things were. I asked for a recommendation and she said hands down the suckling pig. Was some of the driest flavorless pork I've ever eaten. I'm not a fan of adding salt or pepper to anything, especially when at a restaurant of this caliber. But it was needed just to try and get some flavor out of it. And you would think taking a half eaten plate away would prompt one to ask of the meal was satisfactory. Nothing! Not even when she brought the check did she ask if we enjoyed our meal. If you're in Vegas I suggest you choose one of the other fabulous choices in town."

We loved our meal, the food was fantastic.\nThe only reason they got 4 stars, instead of 5 is because they did not treat us as an anniversary couple.  Normally, top restaurants, when they find out it is someones anniversary or birthday, they will send out  a nicely decorated dessert plate.  Not Table 10, they took our drink order and came out shortly after with a one biter, caprese on a toothpick... not exactley worthy of a 5 star rating.  The overall meal was perfectly executed, kitchen was beautifully sparkley and well kept."

This is what we concluded:\n\nPros: \n-The initial bread they give you (my boyfriend liked it, but I did not).  They serve you one piece of bread that tasted no different than a warmed up croissant. Not bad, nothing special.\n- Casual ambiance and impressive wine cellar.\n\nCons:\n-Food was cheap quality and unimpressive.  (I ordered the cheese plate...it came with 3 different cheeses, brie, manchango, and gouda I think it was, some honey, raspberries, and water crackers.  I am ALMOST positive they purchased all of these things from trader joes.  Ive seen all of these things at trader joes, and it tasted identical.  Not bad, but I should have just gone to trader joes to save money...)\n-Quality of food did not match what you had to pay for it.\n-Service was subpar.  We saw our server once or twice...and I felt bad for the guy.  He looked like he was scared to talk to us :(  It made for an awkward evening.\n- Flavor was so so.\n\nOverall:\nAll in all, not a terrible meal, but I was expecting better quality especially with how much you pay.  The service was also very disappointing since the atmosphere is so fun, and the server was virtually mute.  I would personally not go back."

Reading it sounds flavorful not so much the chicken cooked prefect no flavor bland no salt could not find honey thyme sauce. Potatoes not all cooked. Peas where great nice and sweet even though they come frozen they tasted like fresh. For dessert had to try four : Banana Cream Pie, Tiramisu, Carrot Cake, White Chocolate Malassadas with raspberry sauce. The Banana Cream Pie was suppose to have cream was full of banana's little cream not balanced. Tiramisu the lady fingers where not soaked long enough the lady fingers where hard. The mascarpone tasted the same as the cream cheese on the carrot cake.  \nI will try this again in the future.   \n."

The ambiance is nice, it was on the quiet side, but then we ate \"early\" for Vegas to leave plenty of time to get to the show. Our server was a bit spacey about the menu and telling us about the cocktails that were delicious but only offered during happy hour. She finally got her act together and made some excellent recommendations; or confirmed that what I wanted would not disappoint. The Dungenous Crab Salad was very good, however I can't stop thinking about the Scallop Crudo, that was my favorite and I want to go back and have more - the pickled watermelon rind is a bit like pickled onion and strong, but the juices on the scallop were perfect. The baby back ribs were also great, falling off the bone. I now know how to eat ribs with a fork and knife, since this is a classy joint, but there was no speck of meat left on the bones :) My b/f's stuffed chicken was also yummy. It was all good, even the bread. We didn't enjoy any wine, but they have a fun glass cellar in the center of the restaurant."

The first 3 courses are slightly smaller than the regular plates, but the dessert is in regular size. There were definitely more than enough food. We were so stuffed. \n\nFor the 1st course, I had lady apple salad. It was ok. Just tons of apples, some arugula and a slice of cheese. My husband got the CHICKEN & ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE GUMBO. Intense flavors. It was pretty good. \n\nFor 2nd course, I got MUSHROOM RAVIOLI. Earthy, umami and creamy. That sauce was so delicious. My husband had EMERIL'S NEW ORLEANS BBQ SHRIMP. It was the BEST dish of the night. Perfectly cooked shrimps. So flavorful! We soaked up all the BBQ sauce with the biscuit and bread rolls. Highly recommended! \n\nI ordered the ANGUS SHORT RIB for main course. Unlike most braised short rib. This one was very juicy. I love that charred cauliflower puree too. Amazing. Husband got the bolognese pasta. It was fine. Light. The pasta was al dente which I like. But it is still a bolognese pasta after all. \n\nDessert! Berry Cobbler & EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. The cobbler was light and tasty. We like it. But nothing can stand close to the banana cream pie! Flaky crust, tons of banana, sweet caramel sauce and chocolate shaving. Great combination. Delicious! \n\nNo doubt we will back when we are in town. Emeril, you didn't disappoint! I love your food!"

Not a basket where the bread will get cold, but one. =)\n\nCrispy Calamari (appetizer): it came with 2 dipping sauces.

My bf was surprised that I liked it because I tend to like food with rich flavors like with sauces and what not. \n\nPasta Jambalaya (bf's entree): bf wasn't too happy with his jambalaya because he thought the flavor was too \"fishy\" probably from the shrimp. And he's very sensitive to that. I didn't taste it though because I couldn't even finish my own food!\n\nFruit on the Bottom Lemon Creme Brulee (dessert): we are such creme brulee lovers and wow. This one was spectacular. I really like lemons too so the combination was great. I think the lemon flavor brought out the lightness of the creme brulee. On the bottom were blueberries. They were really sweet so combined it was a light yet fruity sweet (not sugar sweet) tasting creme brulee. mMmMMmm bf said that the creme brulee was the highlight of the meal for him. =)\n\nWhat made this experience even better that the service was excellent. My bf had ordered a half size wine bottle and they would constantly come and fill his cup to a certain amount after he takes like one sip. Our glasses of water were constantly refilled as well. And I like how they make a big deal out of presenting the entrees to the table at once so that we both get our food in front of us at the same exact time. They were very friendly and attentive. Great service!\n\nLink to restaurant: http://www.palazzolasvegas.com/table10.aspx"

Then we had the Ahi tuna which was probably the nicest piece of ahi I have had other than a sushi bar! Great job!! And they get cooked raw!! I could have had 2 dinners this was so good!!! Super nice staff and they even have awesome bourbons (Ask for the Pappy!)   We also had a couple of wonderful salads but can't remember which one we had sorry!

We started with ESCARGO. We didn't regret our PASTA JUMBALYA and the LAMB SHANK it was great.  Especially the shank, cooked perfectly, it was so tender, just falling off the bone. Would highly recommend it. We also had some side orders of LOBSTER TAIL and MACRONI & chesse. Only complaint would be the mac, it was a bit too garlicly for my taste. For both of us actually, it was the only thing we didn't finish. To finish we had the BANANA FOSTER BREAD PUDDING. Doesn't really stick out in my mind, I had to look up the menu to remember what we had, so it was probably alright? OVERALL the experience was great, service and food exceptional and the bill wasn't bad, around $200. We didn't partake in any wine, maybe that's why. Would definetly recommend Table Ten if you like to eat food. Especially good food."

We were seated immediately without a reservation.\n\nFor drinks I ordered a well-made sazerac cocktail (this wasn't on the cocktail menu but is a New Orleans classic), and she had a glass of sauvignon blanc (don't remember the brand, but she said it was good).\n\nWe split the hush puppies for an appetizer. The tomato currant chutney they come with was tasty, though I didn't think it worked particularly well with the hush puppies (she thought it did), which were delicious on their own.\n\nFor entrees, she had the pasta jambalaya and I had the pork tenderloin. The pork tenderloin was very tender and paired nicely with the sweet potatoes. The mole and glaze were welcome accompaniments. She liked the jambalaya very much. I had a few bites and agreed.\n\nWe typically don't order dessert unless there's something unique, and the wait staff strongly recommended the white chocolate malassadas. These are essentially mini beignets or donut holes filled with white chocolate that you can dip in a fantastic vanilla bean cr\u00e8me anglaise. You must order these. So, we unintentionally began and ended the meal with fried balls of dough.\n\nOverall, the meal was a pretty good value--not cheap of course, but we were prepared for that. The atmosphere is classy but casual enough that it's not stuffy. In other words, all the good of fine dining and none of the bad."

I wouldn't have even known about this place if I hadn't seen a poster advertising their 4 courses for $48 deal in the Venetian elevator. It's a good price for a lot of food, most of it quite good. \n\nFIRST COURSE\nFLAME-ROASTED MARROW BONES: $11 for three giant bones. This was a great start t our meal, with the gelatinous gold spread onto baguette slices and sprinkled with sea salt. (Not part of the 4/$48)\nROASTED PUMPKIN SOUP: I assume it's seasonal, and it is damn good. Get it while you can. This soup is surprisingly thick (like potato) yet smooth, with a light, rich flavor. The toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin oil added just the right bit of \"extra\" to keep it from being too simple.\nCHICKEN + ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE GUMBO: it's not my favorite version, but a passable one for the Strip location. Slightly spicy, surprisingly meaty, and served over soft white rice.\n\nSECOND COURSE\nEMERIL'S BBQ SHRIMP: Overcooked shrimp seemed like it had been sitting out, the NewOrleans barbecue glaze wasn't well-received by others at the table, and the rosemary biscuit had nice flavors but was hard and dry.\nSMOKEY MUSHROOM PASTA: A surprise hit! Fresh, perfectly al-dente pasta with tasso ham, smoked mushrooms, and parmesan cheese, with a zesty Cajun sauce. I could have done without the ham, and expected slightly more mushrooms given the name of the dish, but was pleasantly surprised by this dish.\n\nTHIRD COURSE (MAINS)\nEMERIL'S PORK CHOP: served with caramelized sweet potatoes, which paired perfectly and went perfectly with the colder fall season. This was one of the best pork chops I've had, tender and juicy with plenty of flavor and a great seasoning/glaze. The menu description also mentions a \"green chile mole\" that I either didn't receive or that simply wasn't distinct from the other flavors on the plate.\nCARAMELIZED SEA SCALLOPS: Got this over the short rib at the suggestion of our server, and ended up really enjoying it. Light flavors and portion, consisting of 3 large scallops served on a smear (there really should have been more!) of a great cauliflower puree, with a sea of brown butter sauce, accented with raisins, marcona almonds, and capers. This was surprisingly well-balanced, I liked that the capers didn't overpower the other, milder ingredients. I do wish the scallops had a better sear, though.\n\nFOURTH COURSE (DESSERTS)\nBANANAS FOSTER BREAD PUDDING: A decent bread pudding, topped with two lonely slices of banana, with a caramel glaze and more whipped cream and chocolate shavings. A less successful banana-based dessert.\nEMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE: Heavenly. A homemade crust topped with tons of fresh banana, a blanket of smoothly sweet banana cream, and decorated with chocolate curls, caramel sauce, and whipped cream. I would come back for this.\n\nOur server, Diana, was great at making suggestions and checking on us without being overbearing. Interior seating is dark and quiet with a date-night atmosphere. Large bar area offers a limited \"bar bites\" menu, and there is a HH available, but by far the best deal is their 4 course dinner."

For the price of the meal, something should have really jumped out.\n\nAs a beginning course, I had a salad with \"Salt Roasted Beets.\"  The salad was arugula, feta cheese, pistachios and the aforementioned beets, with a barely discernible vinaigrette.  While there was nothing wrong with the salad, as I said in the opening, it did not wow me in any way...just a solid preparation of a decent salad.\n\nThe entree was a Braised Lamb Shank with Pumpkin Risotto.  The lamb shank was done well, but it could have used a bit more seasoning, as I had to add salt and pepper to bring out the flavors.  The risotto was prepared well, but there was no pumpkin flavor to it.\n\nService, as expected, was quite good."

What a huge huge disappointment.\n\nMy friend and I had a reservation at 7 and it was dead, so we at least figured the service would be great. Wrong. At times it seemed like our server was actually avoiding us on purpose. She was rude and condescending, especially to her assistant server (who was actually nice).\n\nI started with the poached egg/frisee salad. The dressing was extremely salty, but the egg balanced it out a bit. My friend ordered the famous gumbo which looked and tasted very much like it came out of a Campbell's can.\nFor my main I had the special of the day, a blue cheese encrusted steak, with grilled shrimp. I asked for my steak to be medium rare and it came out beyond well done. The shrimp were rancid. Yuck!!!! When the floor manager came over to ask how my food was and I told him he didn't even offer to get me something else! Just took my plate away and brought me back a bread plate and a basket of bread. WTF??\n\nI hate to be one of those picky diners but the whole dinner was really a nightmare. And I could not help but notice how many other tables around me (as the restaurant filled up) were sending back their dinners too.\n\nDessert was probably the best part of the whole meal. My friend had a delicious Frangelico creme brulee, and I had the white chocolate malasadas. Though I was more than surprised when we didn't get at least one of those comped.\n\nDo not waste your time going to this restaurant!!"

Paired excellently with a half dozen oysters to start.

Jumbo shrimp soaked in a sauce of butter, cream, bbq base, various pepper spices. Different spin on a sauce that im used to , but job well done. Very rich, flavor packed punch. Much of that in what id expect in a new saucy experiment.\n\nLastly, Pork Poudin Blanc. Breaded and lightly deep fried donut hole sized ball of pork and rice. Served with a smpe sweet and sour sauce.

We started with the Boston salad,  the dressing was very bland, as was the salad overall.  Perhaps beefing up the dressing flavor and adding some Gorgonzola crumbles would help. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered a Ribeye which turned out to be 80% inedible because there was so much fat.  He also had potato fritters, which again, were definitely lacking in flavor on the inside. \n\nMy filet mignon was ok, but definitely not the best I've ever had, especially at that price point.  Honestly, my fiance grills filets from Costco on our gas grill at home that taste way better and have a much more palatable texture than what I paid nearly $50 for. \n\nLastly, the Sangiovese should be taken off the \"by the glass\" wine list and replaced with something else,  it tastes and smells dirty. \n\nWe did mention something to the Manager about the amount of fat in the Ribeye when he was doing his rounds to check on us.  He felt very badly and ended up comping one of our $16 glasses of wine, which we were fine with.\n\nI'm sure they have great food, we just failed to order any of it.  Oh and the Cabernet on the \"by the glass\" menu was pretty good,  I'd say maybe a 7 out of 10, but stay away from that Sangio, yuk :)"

I must say overall, I was surprised by the value for the amount of food.  Is this the best food on the strip? No, but we had 4 courses for $45.  The ambiance has a bar/lounge feel. They have some large tables facing the casino, that allowed for two strollers to fit.  So overall, I would say if you want a nice meal and want to bring young kids, this is an option.  To start with, they bring a complimentary amuse-bouche, a bacon wrapped date with an almond inside with blue cheese.  This was really tasty and a nice surprise.  The bread is also a warm croissant hybrid accompanied by soft butter.  For the first course, I had the chicken-andouille sausage gumbo.  I think most people would be disappointed by the spice level, but I prefer things mild.  It had more of a peppery taste than a spicy kick.  This was probably my least favorite item out of all the courses.  However, it sounded better than the salads.  Second course, I had the maple bacon.  I also tried a bite of the bbq shrimp and the mushroom vol au vent.  The bacon was thick, salty, sweet....great combination of flavors.  The bbq shrimp was also very tasty.  The mushroom was good but ranked last.  For the main course, everyone ended up ordering the wagyu strip steak...it was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the meat tasted almost buttery.  By the time dessert came around, I was stuffed.  I ended up trying the banana cream pie, since so many people were raving about it.  However, I found the banana to be a little overwhelming in flavor.  My favorite dessert was the apple pie crumble with ice cream.   The apple pie comes warm and definitely a good way to end a meal."

            "review": "One of the WORST dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas, and this restaurant gives Emeril Lagasse a bad name. Hopefully things have improved since I dined here over 9 months ago (June 2014). My friend made reservations a few weeks ahead of time for her Bachelorette Party dinner (6:30pm on a Friday), and our table was ready upon arrival. The restaurant wasn't that busy at that time, but they ended up seating another large party at the table right next to ours, so it got pretty loud and difficult to talk. Also, our food took forever to come, and even though the other table sat down after us, they got their main dishes first. We had to follow up with our servers a couple of times to ask where our food was, which was super annoying. We tried:\n\n-Complimentary Roll (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg&select=lOFU-u16Qf-At8sFyb-c7w): Good, especially with extra butter.\n-Candied North Country Farm Bacon ($10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/table-10-las-vegas?select=aABRFwUVibxfko3LsCuPug#aABRFwUVibxfko3LsCuPug): Yum, this was probably my favorite dish of the night, and a must order for any bacon lover.\n-Truffle + Lobster Mac-n-Cheese (Trio of Cheeses, Real Truffle, Lobster, $19, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/table-10-las-vegas?select=aABRFwUVibxfko3LsCuPug#QtqUtF_UXKbrH7-6ZcINRA): Just ok- I was definitely disappointed since this is supposed to be one of their \"signature\" dishes. The mac n cheese was bland, and although you could see the pieces of lobster, you couldn't taste it. Skip!\n-Sriracha Chicken Wings (Cucumber Buttermilk-Pickled Vegetables, $13, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/table-10-las-vegas?select=aABRFwUVibxfko3LsCuPug#2H8xRZiBNIxFBqub3UbYqQ): The flavor was ok, but some pieces were straight up RAW in the middle. Since we had to leave at a certain time and our food took so long to arrive, I ended up just cancelling this order. We barely got a apology (the server didn't even seem concerned) but at least they took it off our bill. Skip!\n-Emeril's Banana Cream Pie (w/Chocolate Shavings, Caramel Sauce, Whipped Cream, $10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/table-10-las-vegas?select=_WXrRH36kqd_URMZIKVJPA#_WXrRH36kqd_URMZIKVJPA): Pretty good. This was a big portion, and you got a good amount of bananas, but I wished there was a bit more whipped cream.\n\nOverall, the food was way below par of the other Emeril restaurant I've been to (Delmonico's in New Orleans), as was the service. The servers were all flocking to the other table with the large party next to ours, and we were sure it was because they were ordering a lot of alcohol than our table. I think the manager came by at one point to talk to the other table and chomp it up (I saw his title on his nametag) and our table just got a short \"Hope you're having a good meal\" sorta thing. I hope they improve their food quality and service soon, since there are plenty of other nice restaurants in Las Vegas to dine at. I will definitely NOT be back here again, and hope other people see this review and think twice about dining here also."

They didn't make faces when we asked for seconds with the dinner buns.  The food presentation was great.  We ordered the Hush Puppies which came with a yummy vinigrette tomato sauce.  I can drink that sauce.  I had two starters:  Gumbo w/rice and Fish Tacos w/coleslaw.  My friend loved her Asparagus salad.  The dressing was wonderful.  The trout was nicely done.  I wish I could have taken a picture of how they roasted the fish in this artsy rotisserie just for the fish.  The BBQ ribs was tender."

Given the huge choice of fancy restaurants in Vegas, and the presence of an in-n-out burger, I see no reason to eat here.  Portions weren't huge, and my pasta jambalaya was bland and generally lacking in meat.

The decor was great- just intimate enough, but still casual enough for lunch. This may be weird, but one of my favorite parts was the bathroom design and decor- I like the layout, and I love the floor tile. \n\nWe decided to order a bunch of small plates and mostly share, instead of each ordering an entree. We also had some wine. \n\nWe tried the Caesar salad, the gumbo, the stuffed red peppers, the flatbread, the salumi plate, and lobster ravioli, and the gnocci (there were four of us). Everything was great! The gnocci was delicious- moist, light, and pillowy. The peppers, stuffed with goat cheese, were fantastic, and the flatbread was very good. I didn't try the caesar salad, the gumbo or the lobster ravioli, but all three looked good (and I was told they were). The salumi plate didn't stand out as anything extra special, but it was good, and came with an interesting mustard. \nI did order an espresso after our meal, and that was tasty. It was bold but smooth, and came with the customary piece of lemon peel. Everyone else ordered a dessert, including an ice cream dish, a banana cream pie, and tiramisu. I tried a bite of the banana cream pie, and it was really fresh-tasting. Pictures of everything are uploaded! \nOverall, this was a much better experience than I was hoping for based on other reviews. I would absolutely return, and try additional menu items."

Based on this dish alone I would have given the place 5 stars. However, I have been back multiple times and they have taken it off the menu and The food has been good but not great since then. I've had really good dishes and some pretty mediocre dishes. That being said whenever I've had an issue with a dish I was well taken care of. Don't get me wrong, the food is good and the prices are definitely reasonable considering you are in the Palazzo but they set the bar really high on my first trip in and have yet to hit the bar again food wise.\n\nWhere Table 10 really shines is during happy hour with their app and drink specials. You can get a signature cocktail designed by master mixologist Max Solano for a really good price and if you check in on foursquare or yelp you get a free sangria. Actually if it were not for Max's drinks prepared perfectly by Hagan and Pedro I would probably have given table 10 three stars instead of 4. The bartenders take really good care of their customer and in my experiences here, they are better servers than the servers are. Hagan, who I have worked with most, is always on top of things and will make sure you have a good dining experience and Pedro saved the day one time when I had an issue with the bone marrow. One of the three servings was rock hard and my server told me that when it came to bone marrow that you just get what you get. Pedro happened to overhear that and he immediately came over, took my plate and walked back to the kitchen. Soon after I was presented with a replacement. \n\nIn the end, I usually start my evening here since most conventions I go to are in the Sands and this is just a short walk from there and they are open early. I start my evenings here more often than not and it's a great atmosphere. I hope that eventually I will hit the jackpot again as I did on my first visit for dinner but in the meantime I am content with their generous happy hour offerings and great bar service."

The seasonings didn't match very well with the fish, and there were too many other ingredients in the dish. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate all the shrimp, lobster, clams, and sausage in there, but it just becomes chaotic with all the different textures. Also, the \"kicked up\" garlic bread was just garlic bread.\n\nThe others liked their dishes though, and they tasted pretty good (especially the crawfish pasta) and the calamari was exceptional. However, there seemed to be a consensus that the truffle mac n cheese was nothing special. I wish I got the pork tenderloin, cause I'm sure Emeril knows how to make a great pork dish. Oh well, maybe next time.\n\nWould come again to try some of the other dishes since the prices are reasonable for Vegas hotels and the service is great."

So, I fully understand that my review may be a bit biased, since we received excellent service and a few creations directly from Sean - he's trying some new things out on the menu, which is a clear indicator to me that Table Ten is supportive of good-intentioned progress. A great sign for any restaurant, indeed. Sean spoke with us and explained his commitment to local, organic food sources - and how he's incorporating some of these items into the new menu.\n\nWe started out with an incredible array of appetizers - the knockout being a gumbo-style dish. The flavors were completely punch-you-in-the-face delicious and the shrimp was prepared perfectly. \n\nWe also tried the pork dumplings (my husband's fave, he's never met a potsticker he didn't like), which were wonderful.\n\nOrganic Kentor Farm Spinach Salad - AMAZING. Perfect combination of flavors, Sean! I could've had this as a meal.\n\nI know we had a couple other things, too - all of which were delectable. But of course, Sean treated us to my favorite dessert of all time (how did he know?!) - Bananas Foster.\n\nAY CHEE WAH-WAH!\n\nIt was truly one of the best desserts I've ever had. The combination of warm bananas, ice-cold vanilla ice cream, and caramelized sauce is out-of-control luscious. It was elegant in its simplicity. YUM. \n\nI'd highly recommend this place - Sean is doing some great things here, and it will be great to see the changes he implements take hold. I'm sure there's a bit of an adjustment period taking place at Table Ten, but if our meal was any indication, everything is headed in a great direction.\n\nOne of our best dining experiences in Vegas."

This was my second visit here, and I continue to love this place.  Being a soup person, I love the country gumbo with steamed rice.  I had some great starters: jalapeno & corn hush puppies, adobe rubbed baby back ribs, and the truffle mac n cheese.  My entree was a wonderful dish: Seared Maine Scallops, jumbo lump crab, lima bean and tomato succotash, creole tomato glaze, and parmesan cheese.  I added a deshelled Maine lobster tail and some grilled baja shrimp to make a meal of Homeric proportions.  It was truly worthy of the name Emeril Lagasse.  For dessert I had one of my favorites: Emeril's: White chocolate malassadas rolled in cinnamon sugar with vanilla creme Anglase.  It is perhaps my favorite light dessert, unlike Emeril's banana creme pie at Emeril's fish house.  Table Ten is truly a hidden gem in the same Palazzo casino as his more heralded Delmonico, and Lagasse Stadium restaurants.  The next time I am in New Orleans I must pay homage to Table #10 in Emeril's original restaurant.  BAM!!!"

My husband and i dine out often yet we're always disappointed about something when we go out. My view on going out to eat is it should be worth the money and you should always feel satisfied when we walk in as well as when you leave. My husband and I will for sure be going back whenever we have date night. Also their food was so good. Everything had great flavor and i have zero complaints about this place.

He ordered the Seared Scallops and took his time eating it, in tiny little bites because otherwise he would have been done eating in 3 minutes and watch me while I eat the rest of mine. I ordered the Creole Roasted duck, I expected it to have a Louisiana twist since it's a 'creole', but it wasn't. Nevertheless the flavor was good. There were three good size pieces of duck, a sausage, green beans, a fried ball of something, maybe a cornbread? So mine was filling, and not bad at all. The Blood Orange margarita was pretty good but I added a little water because it's a little too sour and  I'm such a lightweight. Overall, we had a nice experience."

I ordered the sea scallops and a side of sauteed lobster, both of which were excellent. I did not order a side and regretted that since I feasted on seafood alone. The presentation of the scallops was excellent. \n\nMy fiance got the chicken. It did not look appetizing at all. It looked like an underfed chicken sprawled across veggies. He did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed mine. I guess that may be what you get for ordering \"chicken\" but I think chicken at chain restaurants is more appetizing so I would expect more from this establishment. \n\nFor dessert, I had the milk chocolate mousse cake. It was rich and divine!\n\nThis restaurant is very good, but if you are new to Vegas, I might recommend another option for more bang for your buck."

            "review": "So we were going to Las Vegas and so we could eat some higher quality food.  I chose this Emeril restaurant specifically out of his other three restaurants in Vegas because it was the only one that listed Bananas Foster's as a dessert on his menu.  I love his Cajun recipes on Food Network so I figure this should be good.  I also read that this was an offshoot of his original restaurant in New Orleans- which I really want to try, so I came in with high expectations.   \n\nTo start, my husband ordered the bone marrow and brioche, and also the braised veal cheeks.  We got three bone marrow bones, but 1/3 was barely filled.  He said the bone marrow was good... but very very rich and he said he couldn't eat a lot of it because it was so heavy.   It was salty, but edible... but funny enough, they gave an additional container of sea salt?  I had the braised veal cheeks with some carrots and mushrooms.  It was good- still salty, but I liked it and probably enjoyed the sauce and mushrooms more than the actual meat.  \n\nFor our main entrees, husband ordered the suckling pig and a side of truffle mac and cheese.  I ordered the seasonal monkfish with a tartar sauce and fried vegetables.  The monkfish was just saut\u00e9ed, but it was so incredibly salty that it was inedible.  Even tried to mellow it out with the tartar sauce, but it was still too salty that it numbed my tounge.  The vegetables were coated in tempura but it was so over fried it just tasted like salty popcorn.  Any taste and nutrients were fried out of the vegetables.  Husband said the pork was good... mildly salty but not anything to write home about.  He had to send back the truffle mac and cheese.  The macaroni was so overcooked it was like mush and grease.  There was no cheese, was flavorless, and it was like the macaroni was just tossed in truffle oil alone.  The breadcrumbs were just sprinkled on at the end, and were not baked.  \n\nFinally, I got my long awaited bananas foster, which I was waiting for.  They brought out a plate with a scoop of ice-cream and 2 fried bananas split lengthwise.  The server poured the sauce on top, tableside.  The sauce was completely separated.  The liquid was as dark as soy sauce and sank to the bottom.  There was a clear liquid sitting on top (presumably straight liquor), at least  1/2 an inch deep.  I took one scoop out of it and it was so incredibly bitter.  The fluid was watery. It was as if the liquid hadn't been flamb\u00e9ed at all.  It should have been a caramel color and it should have thickened slightly because it was combined with sugar.  I guess I could have just eaten the ice cream alone but what was the point?  I wanted bananas and sauce.  To give the waiter some credit, he did waive the items we did not like, but I expected more.  So in summary, I had high expectations of Emeril, but was really disappointed and let down.  Everything was excessively salty.  I guess it's down to the actual chef executing it on the night of, but Emeril really needs to go in there and spend some time QA'ing the dishes that have his name on it.\n\nP.S. I would have given a 2 because the service was alright, but the following days, my husband's stomach was not right and he was sick for days after the excessive amounts of grease from the bone marrow."

There were only four pieces of jumbo shrimp though. Uh oh...still hungry? Fortunately, the appetizer was the beef carpaccio, which was served with truffle toast. That was good. The bread brought to our table was deliciously soft and squishy with butter. That helped a bit too.\n\nService was good and the prices are reasonable for Vegas.

            "review": "Good food and great service; the Taste of Table 10 special is probably the best bang-for-the-buck we encountered during our recent family vacation to Las Vegas (4 courses for $48).\n\nMy first course was the beet salad which was excellent. There was a nice combination of different beets (including pickled), as well as a generous dollop of goat cheese. But what really took this dish to the next level was the smear of pistachio butter on the plate - it was definitely a unique combination of flavor that put a huge smile on my face. The sweet corn soup was also very good. \n\nNext was the candied bacon - again, it was amazing. 3 generous, thick-cut slices of bacon with a maple syrup glaze. This dish doesn't need any more explanation, it was simply phenomenal and probably the highlight of my meal. \n\nFor my third course I ordered the pork chop which was served on the bone over yams/sweet potatoes in a green-chili sauce. Although the entree was good, it simply doesn't stand up to the other courses. The thick pork, cooked mid-well, was a little too tough for my taste (hence the deduction of 1 star). The yams were delicious with a mild sweetness, and the sauce tied the dish together beautifully. Don't worry, it wasn't spicy. Other highlights include the beef short rib and filet mignon.\n\nFinally came the carrot cake which far exceeded my expectations. The cake and cream cheese frosting had a nice, firm texture, but it wasn't overly dense or heavy. It came topped with pecans which delivered a satisfying crunchy texture. The banana cream pie, bread pudding, and chocolate torte were also very good. \n\nService was also great - our waitress was eager to give us suggestions, and extra bread (excellent) was promptly brought out upon request. \n\nEveryone enjoyed their meal and there were absolutely no left-overs despite nicely-size portions."

(PS - if you think having a celebrity chef name would make the food somehow taste better... Think twice on whether you want good tasting or just subpar food because of the brand...) \n\nMake A Reservation - I can't emphasize this enough because I saw lots of families with small children waiting for table(s)... Probably passing their dinner time!)\n\nWe were a party of 6 and only 2 dishes were memorable... Amongst multiple starters/6 entrees/side veggies...  That says a lot about ones eating experience.\n\nOur server recommended a \"seafood stew pasta\" dish for me.. It was terrible... Overly seasoned with salt & pepper, very heavy sauce and nothing special about this \"creole\" style dish.  Others had a variation of fish/chicken/porkchop/risotto dish...  \n\nThe pork chop was probably the only edible dish, thick cut and moist.  I think the risotto was the other decent dish... But I was so disappointed with the seafood stew that basically left me thirsting for gulps of water... To tame the acid eroding my palate that I couldn't bother sampling it... Thankfully I had a bite of the pork chop before diving on mine.  The calamari salad, as a starter was the best... (Watch out for the chili peppers!)\n\nService was excellent, attentive at a good pace, not rushed.  Drinks were good (we sat at the bar first and had wine before being seated at our table).  Overall a \"meh, we've had better meals especially in Vegas, no shortage of fine dining... \"  experience.  \n\nHappy hunting & good luck Yelpers!"

I had the beef cheeks and they were tender.. but not really flavorful.  \n2.  Also tried their supposedly amazing truffle mac and cheese.  It is pretty flavorless in my opinion.\n3.  Heard the gumbo was nothing to write home about... and this is a standard Southern dish.\n4.  Scallops were actually quite good... there were only three.  I didn't really care for the creamy sauce that was on the plate but it tasted delicious.  \n\nMy friends said they enjoyed their steak dinners but then again, there are a dozen steak places (like Cut which may be a tad more pricey) in the area.\n\nI would say this is a notch slight about Pinot Brasserie.. but not by much."

I had veggie sides as the only vegetarian options were risotto or pasta, which were the same options at all of my meeting functions. So I opted for grilled asparagus, sauteed mushrooms and some potatoes. I wish I'd gone for the creamed spinach because the asparagus didn't come with anything in terms of a sauce, or even a lemon wedge. Two of my companions had steak and both said they could do it better at home. The appetizers were fair but not outstanding (bruschetta and the jalapeno hushpuppies). The bread was good but I think the breads at Spago are honestly better. Go somewhere else."

The two waiters that served us were Devin and Matt, and they were both wonderful. They were both very knowledgeable about the menu, food pairings, and gave us excellent recommendations. My husband doesn't often comment on service when we go out, but even he was impressed at their level of attentiveness. \n\nNow to the food...\n\nThere was not one thing we ordered that I didn't absolutely love.  Vic got the 4 course option, and I considered it, but didn't want to be stuffed, so I opted for having just an entree (since I'd have some bites of his anyway). His 1st course was a spinach salad with strawberries, pickled  rhubarb, feta, candied nuts, and a balsamic vinegarette. So so good! Who knew pickled rhubarb would be so delicious?! 2nd course was the best bacon I've ever had in my life. Bacon is always awesome, but this was on a whole nother level. Vic's main course was the filet mignon. I don't even like steak, but I really enjoyed this one. I had the salmon with corn and grits, and that too, was perfectly cooked. I don't know how we had room, but we both got dessert too. We shared the banana cream pie and the white chocolate malasadas, both equally awesome. \n\nNo morsel, crumb, or bit of sauce was left on either of any of our plates. It was truly an wonderful dining experience from the moment we walked in, until we waddled our over-filled bellies out of there."

Sometimes at fancy restaurants, service gets snooty if you dont order wine, etc.  But they were completely respectful of our choices.\n\nFood: They start off with bread rolls.  At first they looked like normal bread rolls and I felt disappointed but then i tried it!  It was warm, sweet, and salty at the same time.  DELISH.  We had 2 orders of calamari (the waitress told us the plates were small but actually it was big!  So 1 order should be enough).  \n\nAs for the main dishes:  nice big portions.  Mmm.  3 of us ordered Creole Spiced & Seared Mahi Mahi.  The mahi mahi was perfect and to have all the other seafood accompany the dish... mmm.  1 of my friend ordered the salmon and she loved it.  Another one ordered the Creole Crawfish \"Boil\" Pasta.  SO MUCH FOOD.  He can eat a lot but with this dish, he looked like he barely touched it.  Another friend ordered the buffalo.

The order is huge for an appetizer and was quite reasonably priced.  The smelt were fried perfectly.  Unfortunately, there was way too much salt sprinkled all over the smelt after they were fried.  Takes a lot for me to say that as I like big taste.  Also, tried the beef cheek appetizer.  This was tender and excellent with plenty of vegetables.  The Gumbo was rather mild and needed a Tabasco sauce kick.  I chose the suckling pig \"porchetta\" entree and was underwhelmed.  Bland meat with pretty bland sauce.\n\nThe mixed cocktails were delicious.  Mango and spice was the right combination of sweet and spicy and the agave fresco was very refreshing.

I know they are similiar to croissants but they were just the perfect bite! \n\nWe had dinner for 4 I only tasted a couple of the items so I will only rate those which I tasted. \n\nRoasted Beef Marrow Bones - I know that bone marrow is always rich but the one at Table 10 is extremely rich I believe because it comes with toasted brioche which is also buttered I think the combination of both just makes it a tad overwhelming for me. I have had it at other places before such as Charlie Palmer in Costa Mesa and it didn't taste overwhelming like that at all. The sea salt does cut the richness but this dish isn't for everyone that is for sure. Proceed with caution. \n\nDungeness Crab Salad - This dish is basically a ramekin of crab meat with some greens on top and vinaigrette surrounding it. They do give you a good amount of crab meat which is always good. It was a tad over salted and I am a sodium monster so if it's salty for me then I have a feeling it is over salted. \n\nPorchetta - I must say this dish is good. The pork is very tender and the veggies that it comes with are beyond tender I had to look twice and see they were baby carrots! I would definitely recommend this dish. \n\nLobster Mac - n- Cheese - must order. very good!\n\nDessert :\n\ncreme brulee - very good really enjoyed the hazelnut crust underneath pleasant surprise.\n\nflourless chocolate cake - was okay.. tasted like a brownie more than anything. I have tasted better. \n\nThere was also an Ice cream cookie selection - it was good but VERY rich and decadent proceed with caution for sure! covered in chocolate syrup! \n\n\noverall the service was good and the food was good - it was a decent experience for my first time at an Emeril restaurant."

The thing is, I had read about this place in Frommer's and this was a place they highly recommended, due to its reasonable (for Vegas) prices and high quality Emeril fare.  Vegas, as a whole, is incredibly high-priced and if you're not ready to routinely spend about 100 dollars a meal, I wouldn't go.  Unless you buffet it (and even though, that can get pricey).  OK, so I know that's not entirely true, but that's how it felt at least, not wanting to eat food court fare.  Perhaps I'm just spoiled.\n\nIn any case, we were excited about Table 10, and we ordered a calamari starter, the pork tenderloin and scallops.  All were delicious, although ultimately I believe it gave me food poisoning.  The pork was so tender, and thinking back on it, probably undercooked.  I did, after all, spend the entire next day reversing my fortune.\n\nIt was good food though, and pretty reasonably priced for Vegas.  If I'm going to go all out next time though, I might just head for the Wynn or Bellagio, I kind of wanted to try out the restaurant Picasso."
