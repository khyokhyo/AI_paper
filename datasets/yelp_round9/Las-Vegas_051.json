            "review": "Chose to eat at Stack last night based on Yelp reviews. I was a little skeptical because I never like to spend $50+ on an entree and was worried that I'd end up disappointed with a poorly cooked steak. I love that I was completely proven wrong.\n\nCharlie, our waiter, was amazing. Not only did he bring us the free house shots before we even had time to check in, but he gave his honest opinion on the menu items - not the typical sales pitch to get you to spend more money. I split the Brooklyn filet with my boyfriend and we ordered 3 sides (whipped potatoes, asparagus and Mac and cheese), all of which were well prepared, flavorful and completely satisfying.\n\nOur food came out to order, the drinks were good (not too strong) and the service was amazing. The steak here is delicious; definitely a must try restaurant while in Vegas!\n\nAnd get the dessert sampler - all of the desserts are super tasty!"

            "review": "Came here for a fancy dinner during a bachelorette party weekend. Had reservations for 12 ppl on a Saturday.  The interior is very inviting. The wall decor is unique. I can tell a lot of money was invested.  The menu was preset, so that was good that I didn't have to think of what to order.\n\nShared appetizers:\n\n Hot rock slices of beef app was interesting. You cook thin slices of meat on this 600 degree rock.  Novelty at best.  \n\nTuna tartare? on a cracker was good.\n\nMini lamb gyros, delicious. But they brought out 8 pcs total. Uh...there are 12 of us?\n\nEntree:\n\nFilet mignon. It was better than your average steak, but not filet mignon status.  Had a pat of butter melting atop when served. \n\nSide dishes:\n\nAlthough tasty, here's where it gets ugly. 1 SMALL bowl each of mashed potatoes, broccolini and green beans, and french fries.  Really? There are 12 of us at this table!  We each got like 1 tablespoon potatoes, 3 strands of green beans and/or broccolini, and a few fries.  Ridiculous.\n\nDesserts:\n\nMini key lime cheesecakes.  Very good\n\nRasberry filled donut holes? with dipping sauce.  Also good. A plus that they were warm.\n\nI think our bill came out to $850.  Overpriced, but an overall nice experience.  I think we would've been better off at Ruth's Chris or the like."

For dinner we both had the filet...so tender and full of flavor...I added the jumbo shrimp and my brother had the lobster tail!   we had the boston cream pie dessert...it was one of the nightly specials....the ginger ale sorbet that came with it was awesome and like nothing I have ever had!   The meal was wonderful and the service was top notch!  Don't forget to check in on Yelp....they give you a complementary shot from the bar when you do!"

            "review": "The stars all aligned last week over a random Monday night into Wednesday. A quick jaunt to Vegas studded with a comp room at The Orleans (because $10 Blackjack tables *cough*), tickets to the SEMA Expo and a totally random chance to meet the seller of our home and take her out to a fancy dinner. Why? Because escrow has been an absolute nightmare and she's been exceedingly patient. And for that we're grateful. And it's an excuse to baller-dine. \n\nI made that term up. You can use it. #BD\n\nWhen boyfriend and I began discussing where we'd like to take her he gave me a side glance and said \"I'm almost tempted to...\" At which point I cut him off with \"Go back to Stack?\" \n\nHELL YES, GO BACK TO STACK. I furrowed my brow and scolded myself because I never reviewed Stack after our spectacular freshman visit last March. Shame, shame, Yelp Elite.\n\nBygones. I easily booked via Open Table and we met up with our seller on Tuesday evening for dinner. After letting us know she wasn't a seafood person, we ordered the Hot Rocks sirloin appetizer (so delicious, had it the first visit) and the short rib meatballs. Also fantastic. \n\nB and I split the dish that inspired our return to Stack in the first place, the Stuffed Maine Lobster, which was as mouthwatering as the first time we had it. Our seller had the Petite Filet, which looked to be perfectly med-rare, as ordered. She raved about it. \n\nTwo sides were shared by the table, the Tater Tots and the Mac & Cheese. Both of these are good, but I feel as though they could be elevated with some culinary thought. Tater Tots with truffle dipping sauce would tip this over the edge...ketchup really falls flat. The mac and cheese, well....it's pretty standard mac and cheese. *shrug*\n\nService at Stack on both visits has been on point. No complaints there! The restaurant is swanky yet relaxed, romantic in a casual \"Hey, I just met you and this is crazy, but here's my number, Stack, reserve a table for me, maybe\"\n\nFour solid stars. I teeter on five based on the sides. XO we'll return either way for that lobster!\n\nOh, and I have to give props to our little Vizsla, because when prompted to explain what about our buyer letter prompted the seller to choose our offer over an all cash investor...\n\nWithout hesitation, her reply \"It was Honey.\" Her Huntington Dog Beach picture clinched our new home. Who woulda guessed. \n\nI guess I owe another steak to you-know-who with the paws. *wink*"

            "review": "The 4 star rating is for the food and service during dinner. It would have been a 5 star meal if the level pretentiousness was dialed down a bit from our server during Happy Hour and the Hostess staff.\n\nWe had a 7pm reservation but arrived at 6 for appetizers and a couple of drinks during Happy Hour at Stack.  We had the yellow tail, steak and lettuce wraps along with a couple of beers to start off with.  The Happy Hour special beer was limited to Bud / Bud Light - we went for Chimay and paid $14/glass - ouch!  The appetizers were good, the yellow tail sashimi was fantastic.  Great sauce and very good cuts of fish.  The steak on the sizzling rocks - good, but I think people may be impressed more by the presentation.  The lettuce wraps were also very good - nice blend of flavors.  The only downside was that the waitress could have cared less about paying attention to us - she was more concerned with talking with the bartender.\n\nFor dinner, we enjoyed items from the $40 Prix Fix menu - probably the best deal we could find.  This included an appetizer (all of us had the lobster tacos), a main course (steak, chicken or pasta), and dessert (either the mini doughnuts or the banana bon bon).  The food was very good - although the lobster taco appetizer was quite small, the accompanying guacamole sauce was excellent.  I had the chicken and grean beans for my main course and it was perfectly done.  Juicy and well prepared.  Our waiter was attentive, but not overbearing for dinner.\n\nI'd recommend Stack for a very good dinner - and with the set menu that is offered, it's a good deal for Las Vegas dining!"

            "review": "going through the menus of the places to choose form in the Mirage was not that hard to narrow down to Stack, it seemed to have some of our favorites and from what we could tell the food was well prepared and the place had decent ratings. We had Tickets to Beatles Love that night so we made reservations for 7:30 PM and when we arrived we walked right in. \n\nThe decor of this place is pretty cool it is very modern, the lighting is kept dark which I'm sure is in an attempt to keep the mood intimate. Now for the important stuff, the food. We were having a date night so we went a little above the normal, we started off with the lobster taco appetizer ($21) this was delicious but definitely small, for our entree we ordered the surf and turf for 2 ($159) which was Huge and super delicious it came with 42oz of prime meat and a 2lb stuffed lobster that was stuffed with King crab and a Ritz cracker mixture, all I can say is wow.. The two sides ordered where the Adult tater tots which are an experience all in itself and then the ultimate let down that was ordered was the baked mac and cheese. Unlike most other steakhouses in Vegas that normally have a Truffle mac and cheese this was just very plain and dry and seemed like they really just threw some noodles in a dish and sprinkled some cheese on top and threw it in the oven. We also ordered the banana cream pie bites for dessert, those I have to add were absolutely amazing. With all of this our dinner ended up running about $300 and the question was, \" was it worth it?\" I would say yes in this case. \n\nThe servers had a great handle on everything, our drinks never went empty, All of the questions we had were answered and I not one time got that overwhelming pretentious feel you sometimes get at some of the high end steakhouses here in town. Will I go back? Sure, would I do anything different? Yes, I would go for a seafood stack appetizer and stay away from the small bites appetizers since they definitely pay the bills with those."

            "review": "My friend wanted to try this spot for a bachelorette party. We made reservations WELL in advance. Once we checked in with the hostesses - they were rude and unwelcoming. Even after having a reservation, we were told that the wait would be 30 minutes. Having a reservation for over a month at this spot, our table should be ready when we check in. Typically 30 minutes isn't a long time and I would bite my tongue and just wait, but we had 10 girls and plans immediately after. One of my girlfriends went up to the hostesses about 15 minutes after we were told to wait (I have no idea what she said, but we were seated very quickly after that) \n\nMy friend made a reservation they gave us the option of having a prefix menu because it's easier for a large group. We didn't want the prefix menu so we chose to order what we wanted at a $40 minimum. She even had to sign a ridiculous contract in order to set this reservation. Once we were seated, the waiter gave us the prefix menu and we told him that we had prior reservations for ordering anything on the menu but having a $40 minimum per person. The waiter was EXTREMELY rude and pretty much didn't want to serve us (probably because the prefix menu is an easy tip for him - lazy)\n\nBESIDES the fact that their entire staff is incompetent and lazy, the food was actually pretty good. \n\n-Me and my friend decided to split the seafood tower (the middle tier that was 80$) and it came with 2 lobster tails, 4 huge shrimps, 3 pieces of crab leg, and 8 oysters. \n-The tater tots were really good as well although I don't think I would ever spend $11 bucks on these again. I mean... they're tater tots. \n-I tried a piece of my friends Tomahawk bone in rib eye and THAT WAS AMAZING. It was huge too. I wish I would have ordered this\n\nThe drinks were average. The bartender made us \"special shots\" (that probably had spit in them) but they were called \"white gummy bears.\" (it's pretty much raspberry vodka with peach schnapps and sprite) nothing special or amazing. \n\nThe two stars is for the food. Everything else gets zero stars - sorry stack - you shouldn't have customers jump through ridiculous hoops to make a reservation."

The ambiance is chill, there was good music playing but not so loud you couldn't talk, and I kept reminding myself we were in the heart of a Vegas casino....  \n\nwe ordered cocktails, the seafood platter as a starter (excellent), split a Caesar salad (good), and one entree of sea bass over lobster risotto (excellent), and one petite filet (cooked perfectly, and one of the best I've had in ages), with a side of asparagus. and a nice bottle of Malbec.  everything we ordered was cooked perfectly, and we were actually surprised at the quality of the food. The menu is on the pricey side, but so was everything else in Vegas, so we got over that early and enjoyed the excellent dinner and service."

            "review": "I visited Stack as part of a 10 person party during a recent vacation in Vegas. We went late, after the early showing of \"Love\" (highly, highly recommended, BTW). They got off to a good start when a request for an extra spicy bloody mary with no celery delivered in solid fashion. Then, we had appetizers for the table:\n\nHot rock beef: Quite nice, thinly sliced and great with a cooking time of, oh, about 1.5 seconds per side :) \nYellowtail sashimi: Fresh taste but not up to par with a top sushi restaurant. \nChili cheese fries: An upscale twist on an everyday dish. The chili was fantastic; a bowl of it would make a great meal. \nAdult tater tots: Very large tots stuffed with bleu cheese (I believe); very, very tasty and generous portion. A little shy on cheese, though, as someone else noted. \nLobster tacos: Tasty and full of tender lobster, but a but small. \nPigs in a blanket: Interesting shape, but not otherwise remarkable\n\nFor my entree, I chose the bone-out sirloin, medium rare. It was cooked to perfection, very flavorful and juicy. A definite winner. My wife and step-daughter had the surf and turf which looked small on the plate, but was huge on taste and tummy-filling satisfaction. \n\nFinally, the jelly filled donut holes for dessert were plentiful and heavenly in taste and texture. \n\nSince nobody in our party drank more than one drink and we shared a lot, we just split the bill ten ways. The total per person, including tip and tax, was $90. I commented at the time that a similar meal back in Dallas, outside of the luxury hotel markup, would have probably cost $75-80, so not a bad premium. \n\nPlease be advised that I'm pretty stingy on the five star ratings; this particular restaurant missed it because of some of the appetizers, limited menu and lack of an absolutely killer entree among the ones we ordered."

For a steakhouse that positions itself as high end, their customer service is zero stars.  If you are going to spend close to $100 per person for a meal here, your expectations are high.\n\nFirst problem: the restaurant wasn't busy at all and the waiters would be talking with each other about the NBA finals, which club they went to last night, etc.  During this time, I finished my steak and was waiting for someone to take my plate.  After waiting, I had to flag someone down before.\n\nSecond problem: when I left, the hostesses were talking with each other when I walked by, totally ignoring me like I was invisible.\n\nBTW, the steak was great, but the bad customer service experience tainted the whole meal."

We ordered enough food (three apps) to get a sense of this portion of the menu but can't speak for the full dinner experience.\n\nThere are five of us here in Vegas for the weekend - two couples and an exchange student (high school). We had tickets for Love and needed a place to grab a quick bite before the show. We had dinner reservations elsewhere after the show. We jut needed a quick something to tide us over.\n\nWhen we arrived the first thing we noticed was that the hostess was kind of a bitch. Despite that fact we stuck around since it was close to the theater. It's also a beautiful space. We ordered drinks (a diet with lemon, glass of wine and two extra dirty martinis, straight up, with blue cheese stuffed olives) and three apps (yellowtail sashimi, hot rocks, pigs in blankets*). The drinks took a while to arrive but the martinis were well-worth the wait. Wow. With the extra time it took to bring the drinks one would think the lemon would have arrived with them but no such luck. The waitress remembered when handing them out and said, \"lemon\" but still had to be reminded when the food came. Eh.\n\nThe sashimi brought in decent reviews from the fish eaters in our crowd. The presentation was beautiful but the portion was a little small - perfect for two or three, though. Keep that in mind if going in for snacks. The hot rocks are pure kitsch but seriously lack flavor. This may be because we got it gluten free so it was missing soy sauce but even so, steakums on a rock? Eh. The aforementioned, difficult to pluralize pigs in blankets were really good.\n\nService was spotty, all the waitresses look exactly the same and if the attitude is part of the vibe Stack is going for they should reconsider. I don't need my waitress to be my friend but she should smile once in a while and check in. For a quick bite it'll do but my next trip to the Mirage will include trying another place. \n\n-----\n*Anyone know the proper way to pluralize this?"

Definitely recommend the \"hot rocks\" (kobe beef that you cook yourself on these steamed stones)....MMMM it practically melted in my mouth. The seabass was tasty with it's shellfish broth and lobster risotto. I'd definitely recommend paying a visit to Stack the next time you're in Sin City."

I know he could have fit at least 5 in his hand. My friend had ordered her steak medium well and they brought it out medium rare. My friends had told the host and server multiple times that it was my birthday and if I could get a desert, they forgot to bring the desert so when we asked for a 3rd time we waited for 15 minutes and I finally gave up on the desert and left.

I went to dinner here right before seeing the Beatles' LOVE show (which I will review later) and managed to get seated sans a reservation on a busy Saturday night (I was here for CES but the Adult Entertainment Conference was also in town).  \n\nFirst impressions are very big to me when it comes to my first dining experience and so I was glad to be greeted by some smokin' hot waitresses.  Usually a sign of something exciting, though sometimes a sign that they're trying to compensate for something.  But I'm all about giving restaurants the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe ambiance is super trendy, which also equals very loud!  I felt like I was in a club!  Not to mention, it was so dark in there I could hardly read the menus and you get seated so close to the table next to you, it's almost a requirement that you make new friends.  \n\nThe food was alright but according to my price-to-tastiness ratio, this place gets a C.   I had the house special risotto with black truffles which was actually an appetizer but came in an itty bitty bowl - very simple but way too greasy for my taste.  My coworker had a few of their American style appetizers (tater tots, etc) which were, not surprisingly, mediocre.  The service, on the other hand, was excellent - everything I'd expect from a nice restaurant - the waiters were very attentive without making us feel rushed, the napkins were always folded when we left, and the bathroom attendant was adorably nice!  Even though I didn't pay, the price-to-tastiness ratio weighs heavily on my stars and stacked up to the rest, three stars is all I can give you."

If it wern't for that I'd give this place 4, maybe 5 stars.  I digg the atmosphere they created and the music is loud if that bothers you.

We sat on two different evenings in the bar area, which gives a wonderful view of the diners, the casino, and the bar itself.  Beautiful, hot staff lol.  But you can't eat them.  So onto the food:\n\nMy favorites were the mains:  Sea Bass on lobster risoto with a sublime broth, and a salmon w/rock shrimp etoufee and spinach.  Had both.  Loved them.  For starters I liked the tuna tartar with my Riesling.  And the house Riesling is AWESOME.\n\nI was less enamored with the Oysters Rockefeller and Lobster Rolls.  And other apps that we had, well...I just can't recall them anymore.  Look, if you're at the Mirage, you could do worse.  And you could also pay more.  I WOULD GO BACK.

To start, the menu has a great selection of appetizers, courses, and sides that are easy to mix and match. \n\nAppetizers:\n\nHot Rock: Thinly sliced layers of beef that you cook on a 600 degree rock. We actually ordered a second round, because the beef literally melts in your mouth. The rock also adds an element of danger, which we found quite exciting.\n\nYellowtail Crunch: I'm not a raw fish person at all, and I loved this. \n\nRock Shrimp: Not my favorite dish of the night, but the thai chili sauce was fantastic.\n\nDinner:\n\nGarbage Salad: For my gluten free friend, we ordered the garbage salad. You could tell a lot of love went into this salad. Everything was chopped up and mixed to perfection. I was eyeing the hearts of palm and blue cheese crumbles.\n\n2 lb Maine Lobster: Yes, this was definitely my order. This could have been my last meal on earth and I would have been happy. The lobster was stuffed with a ritz cracker stuffing and had fresh drawn butter. I might even cry just remembering that part of the meal.\n\nSide Dishes:\n\nAdult Tator Tats: The cutest presentation. It came on one of those petite cast iron dishes with a mason type jar of ketchup. The tots were filled with bacon and brie. Amazing.\n\nWhipped Potatoes & Baked Mac & Cheese: The Mac and Cheese won this round. I would go back to Stack just for the Mac & Cheese. It had smoked ham, peas, and a crunchy topping. Adult junk food at its finest.\n\nDessert:\n\nWe were so full at this point, but I refused to leave without trying something, so we settled on the Banana Cream Pies with malted chocolate ice cream. Everything tasted homemade, and it rivaled even my favorite banana pudding at Magnolia's in New York. I wish we could have tried the jelly doughnuts or molten chocolate cake, but that gives us a good reason to go back."

I dined here for my mother's birthday and had the best experience from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with luxurious African mahogany tables and wooden pannels tiered in a way that reminds me of the Antelope Canyon in Arizona. The lighting is dim and the music was up beat creating a fun yet intimate atmosphere. \n             To start off, the ladies at the door were very friendly and welcoming. Before we had time to approach the host stand we were already greeted with smiles. We were sat right away without waiting and the hostess wished my mom a Happy Birthday which was a very nice gesture that made her happy.\n        Our servers, Zach and Manny were very attentive and had menus ready to go for us as soon as we sat down. My mother was unable to eat meat that night so she ordered the Seabass that comes with a delicious Lobster Risotto that literally melts in your mouth. Being a steak lover I ordered the Petite Filet with a side of Truffle Mashed Potatoes that have a unique taste unlike the regular mashed potatoes. For appetizers we shared the infamous Hot Rocks which are thin slices of sirloin beef in a spicy zesty ponzu sauce. Not only were they delicious but it was also fun to get to fry the meat on a hot rock at the table. My mother and I also ordered the Pigs in a Blanket and the Yellowtail Sashimi; they were equally delicious as everything else. Zach, our server made suggestions for our wines and we did not regret it. Since my mother had the Seabass a cold glass of Sauvignon Blanc was a perfect wine to top it off and I had the Prisoner red blend that went perfect with my steak. \n           The manager sent out a dessert for us that said Happy Birthday on the plate. That was very kind of him and made my mother very happy! It was a delicious Warm Chocholate Cake with a scoop of ice cream. It was the perfect size because after such a heavenly dinner we barely had room for anything else. \n           Overall experience was one of the best I've had as a diner. Everyone was attentive, approachable, and welcoming. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting or living in Vegas. Stack is the place to be!"

While the decor fit the restaurant theme- dim mood lighting and dark, rich wood walls- the menu was a bit more \"fun\" than your average steakhouse. \n\nWe started with the following apps:\nPigs in a blanket- FUN! Who has pigs in a blanket on the menu. Great lil smoky sausages wrapped in buttery flaky pastry served with a small carafe of BBQ sauce. Good stuff.\nYellowtail Crunch- Mini \"tostadas\" of fresh diced yellowtail, mixed with a slightly spicy sauce and served a top a crispy won ton disk. Yum!\nAdult Tater Tots- Now I'm not a fan of Brie, but fry it up and mix it up with bacon, oh yeah, everything is better with bacon :) Great!!\nPan Seared Dumplings- Steamed, pillowy soft clouds of a chicken/pork/veggie mix. Great crisp \"crust\" on the base from the sear served with a zingy soy dipping sauce. \n\nFor my main dish, I chose the Petite Filet Mignon. A 9oz filet, tender and simply seasoned. Mm, mmm!\nWe also got a few sides for our main courses:\nCrunchy Steakhouse Fries- Crispy, thick cut potatoes with truffle oil and parmesan. Yum!\nBaked Mac 'n' Cheese- This looked good, but truth be told as someone who doesn't do well with too much cheese, I passed on this one. \nGreen Bean- we needed at least some green! Simply crisp steamed green beans. \n\nBecause we hadn't indulged enough...we had to have dessert!\nBanana Cream Pie Bites- Petite mini bites of a smooth banana cream pie. \nMunchkin Jelly Donuts- Sugar coated puffs of jelly filled donuts.\n\nService was prompt, friendly and efficient. Food came out well timed but quick. Refills provided and plates cleared promptly. \n\nA bit more of a casual steakhouse, with some fun, yummy offerings not normally found in other steakhouses. \n\nI really enjoyed my meal and the service was great. I would definitely return!"

We'll go simple with Pros/Cons.\n\nPros: Incredible steaks - truly, one of the best steaks I have ever had anywhere (filet mignon and my husband's new york strip were perfectly cooked).  The mac and cheese is to die for.  I was jealous I didn't order this myself after tasting it.  Huge side portions for a nice steakhouse.\n\nCons: There really isn't anywhere to sit while waiting to be seated, except on the casino floor - kind of awkward.  Also, the music is way too loud.  I know I always sound like an old lady when I say that - but there were 8 of us here for dinner at a roundtable in the center of the restaurant and I could not hear what anyone said except for the people seated immediately to either side of me.\n\nConclusion: if you are trendier than I am, don't want to talk to your friends for an hour or so, but enjoy a great steak - you'll want to give this a go"

She originally picked this place based on a martini she wanted on the menu.  We sat down, they said they no longer made that particular martini and for some reason the $50 steak we said we'd get for dinner was no longer what she wanted for dinner.  I told HER to tell our server we were leaving...she just didn't want to eat there.  Since then I HAVE wanted to go back because I always like a GOOD meal for my final night while visiting Vegas and I go every year.\n\nFast forward to 2014, last week to be specific.  I already told my friends about my previous experience of not eating here and they were down for whatever.  I don't know how Stack compares to the other higher end restaurants in the Mirage but I was determined to eat here regardless.\n\nFor starters, I was super impressed with the wine, drink, and dessert menu on an ipad...fancy schmancy!  Being my last night in Vegas I figured I had to split payment (cash/charge) for this meal and asked if we could get separate checks.  I must have asked our waiter too many questions because he kept his cool though I sensed I was getting a bit annoying...I did compensate him with a tip larger than 20% on my portion of the bill.\n\nI ordered the petite filet, adult tater tots, and a glass of cab.  YUM-O!!!! They were all amazing!!! Yes, expensive but you get what you pay for with good quality restaurants.  My friends loved their meals as well - one ordered steak and the other ordered salmon I believe...I'm not sure, I was too into my own meal throughout dinner.\n\nWe couldn't decide on one thing for dessert so we got the dessert sampler and everything that came on there was amazing as well.\n\nGo here...really, just go!!!!!!!! \n...and stay for your meal, too! :)"

Management really needs to look into retraining their staff starting with the hostess and working their way down through servers.  \n\nArrived at 5:52pm for a 6pm reservation on a Monday night to a relatively deserted restaurant and were told we had to wait 8 minutes to be seated- and would have to wait at the end of the ramp since we had 2 children with us and they weren't allowed in the bar.  (note:  the bar part isn't the problem, we wouldn't bring kids into the bar, but really..... sending us 10ft from the hostess stand to wait exactly 8 minutes was rude)\n\nSeated:  Drinks were slow to arrive and the bar was completely empty.  Two bartenders literally standing around doing nothing.  Appetizers took almost 30 minutes.  Food runners had to circle around waiting for someone to clear the apps for entrees.  Had to continually flag someone down for drink refills, check on our food, get our check, check on dessert, clear the plates.  Just ridiculous and disappointing.\n\nOn a happy note, the tuna tartare and scallops were amazing which saved it from getting 1 star.  With so many restaurants to choose from with much better service, I hope they step their game up because the food is delicious, just not worth the headache."

The ambience is great. The service is exceptional. The food is delicious but there is VERY LITTLE of it for the exorbitant prices they charge. A $21 shrimp cocktail contained 4 shrimp. You get a singe small crab cake for $22. The drink prices were even worse. TWENTY FIVE dollars for a margarita that was pretty light on liquor despite the small bottle of Grand Marnier that accompanies it. You'll leave hungry and around $130 lighter if you come here for drinks/appetizers."

First off tho, I do feel like the seafood platter is not anything special than if you were to buy fresh seafood at home and eat it that way..so SKIP it.  Save the money for their actual food.  \n\nHot Rocks - Yummy..but pricey as hell!  $21 for 5 slices of thinly sliced beef (and not even like waygu beef) that you grill on a..well..HOT ROCK..with sauce on the side.  It's good but so pricey for what it is.   If i end up winning money in vegas, I would probably order it again \n\nBlack Cod Tacos - I'm not even sure if they have this anymore.  Their current menu shows crab.  But this was the BEST dish we ordered.   We initlally ordered the seafood platter, Hot Rocks and something else that probably didn't wow me cuz i forgot.  Might have been seabass.  Anyhoo,  during the end, I decided i was not full at all so i wanted to order these tacos and SO glad i did, they were SOO good.  The best of everything we ordered. \n\nThe bill came out pretty steep for 2 ppl. I'd say after tips, it was about $180 (and again, i was not filled).  To sum it up, the hot rocks was good but way too pricey so booooo.   The best thing we ordered were the tacos (compared to 4 items we ordered).  If they put my black cod tacos back on the menu), i might come back..but after I give other restaurants on the strip a shot."

After making a reservation for 6 people at 5:30pm, and being asked if we were attending any shows or had any time restrictions, I didn't think we had much to worry about, since we sat for dinner, in an empty restaurant at precisely 5:30pm.\n\nThe hostess was pleasant and confirmed the showtime as we were being sat, and I was sure to reiterate this time with the person who I originally thought was our server.  We had expected to enjoy the prix fixe show special menu for $30, but was not offered that menu.  When the server came back to finally take a drink order after a 10 minute wait (while he stood talking in the side station with other staff members, well within our view), we asked about the special menu.  He walked away without a word, picked up 'one' special menu and casually dropped it into the center of the table and walked away.\n\nWhen he came back with drinks and to take our order (he never asked if we had any questions, nor did he offer to explain any highlights or specials), half of our party attempted to order the special menu, and the other half wanted to order a la carte.  The server informed us that it wasn't possible, and that the entire table had to order the special menu.  It is unfortunate that this wasn't mentioned on the phone, because we were all on a budget, and had to go back to the regular menu to choose another meal.\n\nTo add insult to injury, I ended up ordering 2 appetizers (spicy crab and black cod), which ended up costing more than the 3 course prix fixe.  For $17, the spicy crab appetizer was the equivalent of 4 tiny 1.5\" square bites, and the black cod (almost identical to the signature NOBU dish, which is phenomenally more delicious & original), was only 3 butter lettuce cups with aprox. 1oz of fish in each one.\n\nLastly, the $12-$14 cocktails took almost as long as the food to reach the table (again, I reiterate that we were now 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant).  After we ordered coffee, and one dessert (the coffees were spilled all over the saucers and table, and no one ever attempted to apologize or clean up), I reminded the person delivering the coffee to tell my server (for the 3rd time) that we had to leave in 10 minutes to attend the show, and that we would like our check.  After 5 more minutes, I had to walk around looking for the server, only to have to ask him yet again.  The check was finally dropped at 5 minutes to 7:00pm, at which time we had to get up and bring the check to the server for processing, (who was now leaning in the front of the restaurant, joking and laughing with co-workers, within eye-shot of the manager, who had also been leaning on a bar table talking during our entire dinner).\n\nWe ended up being 10 min late for the show and had to wait outside the doors to be seated.  All in all and overwhelmingly terrible and embarrassing experience.  I can see why this restaurant was so empty..."

I was a little disappointed about their service because the restaurant was so empty, I would be much more understanding if the place was packed but it wasn't at all!\n\nThe food was okay, my favorite was the hot rocks appetizer because the citrus ponzu sauce was delicious, but the serving size is so tiny.

It was so incredibly flavorful that I didn't want to use any of the sauces it came with. Everyone seemed happy with their meals: sea bass with lobster risotto, roasted chicken, spaghetti & meatballs. The whipped potatos & Mac & cheese with ham & peas were delicious sides.

Luckily I was able to make a reservation for the same day as the Love show. \n\nWe started off with pigs in a blanket and the spicy Japanese crab, The pigs in a blanket were just like the ones you would get at any cocktail party - amazing! The spicy Japanese crab was just okay - I did not think it was bad per say, it was just not my taste. It was shredded crab on top of rice and lightly covered with a citrus soy sauce. \n\nFor dinner I had the stacked Kobe beef burger with grown up tater tots. The Kobe beef burger was really good, but I didn't not care for the tater tots. They were stuffed with brie cheese and bacon. I think the bacon is what threw me off, I would have liked them if they were just filled with potato and brie cheese. \n\nI then had to have the jelly donut munchkins with vanilla dipping sauce for dessert. OMG!!!! They were amazing. When I bit into these I thought  I was in heaven. Just thinking about them makes my mouth water. \n\nOther than the food, the staff was outstanding, the decor is chic and the food presentation is very clever. For example when the jelly donuts came out, they were stacked in a mini cardboard box that said stack all over it (it looked like a DD munchkin box). \n\nI am so glad I was able to come here. I will defiantly be coming back the next time I am in Vegas!"

They have large round tables which made it much more fun to talk to people. \n\nReally cool ambiance- the decor is simple but beautiful- swanky, elegant with a sort of earthy feel with the carved interior walls. The drink menu looked fabulous. The food menu was also great- I highly recommend the halibut and the steak on a rock (or whatever they call it).  The prices were a little high, but seemed on par with most other places on the strip. \n\nLimited menu, I would not recommend this for gluten-free, vegetarian or vegans. Although, everything our party tried was delicious. \n\nGreat service, overall great experience. I would recommend this to those looking for a gourmet treat without the super-foody snobbery."

The wood paneling on the ceilings reminds you of the Grand Canyon, but the seating is much more comfortable.\n\nThe starter was basically a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup. Which is for me the ultimate comfort food. But I have to say it was the best grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup I ever had and I still cannot recreate the thing at home. The steak was amazing, I ordered medium and it was exactly right. And the homemade doughnut holes. I laughed about it till I tried them in the dipping sauce. It was like drinking a flan it was so good. I will never laugh at doughnut holes again. \n\nBest of all, the service was so fast I had no problem making my show, but it wasn't so fast that they were rushing me out. It was very obvious that they were really expert at getting people in and out for the show efficiently. And it was just enough food not to make me uncomfortable sitting in a theater for 90 minutes. \n\nOne day when I get back to Vegas I'll have to try the full menu, considering how their \"fast food\" came out, it's got to be awesome. Great job everyone."

And there's a DJ?\n\n\nThe food:\nShared the Hot Rocks, which sounded and looked way cooler than the dish ended up being. It's like trying to be a cool version of KBBQ, where you cook your own sliver of beef on a lava rock? But the beef was mediocre at best, and for $21 it was not worth it. \n\nThey try to sell this place as a steak house... but that pic you see up at the top of the page with the steak and melted butter + asparagus? LIES. The petit filet was dry, and when it came out the butter was definitely still cold and not half melted. \n($49)\n\nI ordered the \"Stack\" burger - which was overall a good burger. Nice thick patty (Kobe beef, which made it nice and juicy) and bibb lettuce and tomatoes etc were all fresh. I ordered it medium, and it was pink in the middle. BUT it came with the WORST seasoned fries I've ever tried. I don't think I've ever come across a french fry I didn't like, until now :(  How do you screw up french fries? They were hard, cold, but yet spicy. Oh, and it came with a \"dipping sauce\"...aka ketchup  -___-;; \n($34)\n\nMy friend ordered the Salmon, which came with this crispy fried waif of a rice cracker, which was just really really bland. And the spinach was probably the healthiest spinach I've ever tried....straight up just boiled. \n($38)\n\nOverall, the for what it cost, the food was grossly disappointing. Also, very limited vegetarian options. \n\nThe Service: \nI hate to rag on wait staff, I do. And I get that it was a busy Fri night. But this place was like \"amateur hour\". Our waiter was a little rude, did not know anything about the menu, never refilled my soda, and it took close to 1.5 hours to finally get our food (reservation at 8:30, we did not get our food until after 10pm). Seriously, this is the 2nd slowest restaurant in LV! \n\nDefinitely won't be back."

I had the bone in dry aged sirloin and my colleague has the bone in filet.   We both agreed it was one of the best (if not the best) steaks we have had eating out.    The adult tater tots are incredible with a gooey Brie and bacon center.  I think the ketchup has a smokey flavor to it as well.  The baked mac and cheese was completely finished.  Very cheesy and crunchy with the Panko.   However the finishing touch was the jelly doughnuts.  That sweet sugary dough was perfect after the grilled steaks and savory dishes.   I normally just pop into Stack for the tater tots and a glass of Jordan but we went all out tonight."

We got there at 9pm and they made us wait 5 mins - they were probably  expecting us that we order drinks first before they showed us our table in the half empty restaurant.  I looked at the menu and yes being that it is dark, I had to put the candle in  front of my menu to read.  I was not interested with anything on the menu because I am not a seafood or steak eater.  Yes, they had lamb and chicken on the menu but neither of them sounded good.  Started with the rock - 6 thinly sliced sirlon on a hot rock.  okay, we were very  hungry at this point. The thinly slice is correct as we were told to put the meat for 3-5 secs for medium.   I ended up with a Kobe burger well done and Tater tots.  FYI - the burger comes with fries as this was not mentioned in the menu so in my case I ended up with fries and tater tots.   The girl had chicken with a side order of onion rings.  We were both afraid that our meals will disappoint us as what we ordered shouldn't be $40 per person.   Boy we were wrong.  My Kobe burger was the best I have eaten and do not bother to bite the burger with your hands. Use the fork as it was quite tall.   The tater tots with cheese was really good - I mean first time ever feeling good.   Her chicken plate was also very good as the meat was cooked to perfection for her.  The onion rings were a tad over cooked and the skin of the onion was difficult to chew -overcooked? We were stuffed that we did not order dessert.  Our bill came to $114 with drinks (non alcohol). A bit on the high side, but we felt it was worth it.  The atmosphere though dark felt earthy with a modern trendy touch.  Service was excellent as we had two servers and they were making sure we were taken care of.  The two hosts were very professional and greeted us when we entered and exited."

Then she answered the phone, got off the phone & asked my name. After telling her, she said \"yes, for 6:00\". Uh... what just happened? We were seated early, the restaurant was at about 1/4 capacity yet we were stuck in some awkward corner table, like we were in timeout. Being tall women in heels & our proximity to eachother, the table was quite uncomfortable. Already, my best friend is annoyed. Drink order taken & received with no problem, at which time we placed our food order: lobster rolls, lamb gyros, shortrib meatballs & gratin potatoes. Our waiter insisted we keep a menu, in case we wanted to order anything else. A retrospective quote from my best friend \"make sure you hang on to a menu, because I won't be back!\" Food came, food was delish. Although the lobster roll was fresh & flavorful, it's embarrassing what a ripoff it is. If I recall, it was $23. I'm all about paying for excellent food but there was maybe a tablespoon of the lobster mix. It was worth $7, at most. Our empty plates sat at our table for 20min. No drink refills ever, no check-up ever, no offer for a dessert menu (our most favorite part of dining somewhere we've never been before), no offer for our bill. Now, we're running close on time, because the Boyz II Men show that brought us to the Mirage starts at 7:30 & is on the other side of the casino. So, we're visually stalking the man who appears to be a manager, hoping we can get his attention & let him know about how badly we were neglected. But, his head was down at all times... straightening napkin rolls at empty tables. To the point where it became comical. Here's an idea, apply that attention to detail to the patrons! It was so bad that I actually told my friend that we should just walk out because nobody would notice. Finally, someone came to ask if we wanted dessert. I told him we were now running late & that we needed the bill asap. He brought it right away &, to be honest, we struggled with the tip. Generally 20-30% tippers, we barely were enthused about 15% but we were hoping that the ONE person who did pay us attention- the water boy- would get a cut. On the way out, I grabbed both managers' cards so I can send them an email about how the sh!tty service completely undermines the good grub. The ambiance is cool, the menu has the perfect variety of food & it's worth going back for. Unfortunately, though, we won't be."

The other I had was a chocolate martini which was pretty standard.  The atmosphere was nice but the place was way too busy.  We couldn't find a table.  I'd reccomend making reservations if you want to eat here, otherwise be prepared to come and rub elbows with randoms while you enjoy your drinks.

Hot Rocks came first and then the Caesar Salad. These two items are pricey for what they are. Don't get me wrong, they were great to try, but I don't believe they were worth 30$. \n\nAt the time we ate here, I was more of a fish fan, so I was not sure how that would go since it's more known for the steak. My Sea Bass was wonderful! Probably top three sea bass entrees I have had. When brought out, it was in some kind of soup/ broth. I don't usually finish my meals, and I was able to finish this one. My boyfriend's cowboy steak tasted great. I was able to try some, and it was very juicy.

I could't hear anyone. \n\nOverall, this place is loud and pricey, but the food is worth it."

We had two orders of the Hot Rocks appetizer.  Basically thinly sliced beef that you cook on these very hot rocks.  Sooooo good!!\n\nBut...the main reason for my 5 stars.....i had the best sea bass i've ever had...and i've had a lot.  Sea Bass on top of perfectly cooked lobster risotto.  It was literally heavenly.\n\nService was great....my friend is gluten challenged and she had lots of questions which the server was great with and had no problem asking the kitchen.  \n\n$250 bucks for 3 of us before tip, but that was with 2 appetizers and a bottle of wine.  If i could eat like this every week my life would be infinitely better.\n\nHighly, highly recommend!"

The flavour of the meat was simple but all the other dishes tasted amazing. I would say the side dishes are my favourite, and the steak for two was enough for three of us to share.\n\nService was great, very friendly, but that's to be expected from a Vegas restaurant. When we went, they also gave us free strawberry shots for checking in on Yelp. :)"

After chatting a bit, she directed us towards their margarita - which is $25 - BUT the thing is a DOUBLE and comes with your own private mini bottle of Gran Marnier so you can doctor your drink the way you like it. One of those and we made the glorious mistake of getting a second one. The uber back to our hotel was a blur....\n\nWe decided that -hey, we're in Vegas- and went for the Filet Mignon with a side of shrimp scampi. Incredible. Highly HIGHLY recommend. Thank you to the chef, because the meat was like butter in it's texture and the balsamic butter that they garnish it with is delicious. The shrimp was perfect in it's balance of garlic. LOVED it. And we're from NorCal, so we have a large selection of places to eat that are amazing - Stack is one of the two places that came close to what we expect. \n\nDo yourself a favor - if you're into fine dining, absolutely hit this place up.

Lots of seating and the servers are great. No complaints, they tended to us properly at dinner. They provided me with a complimentary cake because it was my birthday which was nice.

Of course, sin city IS the most expensive place in the US to eat, now.  Regardless, we were seated at a very low-top table next to the casino floor which we liked.\n\nNow, have you seen the episode of Seinfeld where Elaine threatens the diner owner for all of his waitresses being \"similar\"?  Yeah, same concept here.  All looked to be Eastern European with black hair, tanned, and smokin' hot bodies.  Not that I'm complaining, but pretty odd.  Top that all off with the personality of a troll.  I'm sure it was due to the fact that we were there for a drink or two and apps, but if you want a tip, then do your damn job.  We waited about 10 minutes after our drinks came just to see a menu.  Finally ordered.  Two guys got the fries and wings, and I got the fries and lettuce cups.  Their food came out first, and she brought me the wrong french fry item.  I sent them back since I didn't want to pay $15 for some steak fries and some orange looking goo.  By the time they attempted to bring us three orders of lettuce cups (we ordered one), most everyone was done with their meal.  \n\nThe 4th in our party actually ordered a non-happy hour item:  Mini lobster tacos.  Mini is such an overstatement with regards to these.  I think Micro is more suitable.  Anyway, we're talking $5 a BITE.  They were literally the size of my thumb, and he got 4 on his order.  Livid sums up how he felt after this.\n\nAnywway, is the food good?  Yes, what we ordered was good.  Was it worth even coming for happy hour or for the shit service we got?  Not even close.

Spicy tuna roll (SO GOOD), buffalo wings, pigs in a blanket,  scallop lettuce cups, bread sticks, raw meat with hot rocks, and mini shrimp tacos.

The experience was improved somewhat by the Hot Rocks small plate which included thinly sliced sirloin placed upon a heated rock to cook the meat.  Unfortunately the restaurant only provided a minimal amount of meat with the hot rock and as a growing Monkey a few slices clearly was not enough.  The 9 oz Petite Filet was uninspired at best.  If you are looking for steaks in Las Vegas then do not come here.  Mr Massie and the Light Group will need to improve this restaurant or they will continue their slide."

Darn near an hour later still no food, we asked for bread and the waiter comes and says he forgot to put in our order. Nothing else, didn't offer anything on the house or much of an apology. We were mad and complained to the manager and he turned it around. He apologized and offered our food and anything else we wanted from the menu. He reseated us and gave us new waiters and the service was outstanding. Best I ever had in fact. I really appreciate the turnaround because it means this place really cares about the customer which for those prices means a lot. \nOk, now to the dining experience. The music is cool/top 40. The ambience is dark and sexy. The drinks are the best I have ever had (I had an old fashioned). For appetizers we had the wings and sliced beef on hot stones. Both two thumbs up. For food I had the chicken and green beans and adult tater tots. I was so stuffed I didn't want to stop eating it was just that good (and I couldn't take it back to the hotel). But atlas I had to call it quits. My friends had the steak with spinach (very good they said) and the salmon and mashed potatoes (darn near cleaned the plate and they raved about the mashed potatoes which looked like cool whip they were whipped so perfectly). \nThen we got a dessert sampling and their donuty things. Everything was heavenly. I'd recommend everything on the menu. \nTo top it off they offered us a shot and coffee. This was a yummy recipe for sleepiness. This is not a meal you eat and then get \"turnt up\". It was so rich and flavorful it will send you right to dream land. \nYes it is pricey but the food was so good I wouldn't complain if we had paid. (we did tip generously for the free meal, the later service made us feel like queens- they really know how to right things!)"

Their staff is amazing and extremely personable.  Their recommendations have never missed, and the wine pairing suggestions are spot on. \n \nHowever, what is #1 by far (and believe me, the food is fantastic on its own), is the people.  No matter how busy they are, or celebs they're hosting in the backroom, they always take the time to make YOU feel like you are most important guest there that night.  I've had the opportunity this past weekend to speak with Griffin Schaffer, their General Manager, and the CLASS ACT starts at the top, and is felt all the way down through hostess, servers, chefs, etc.  You know when someone \"get's it\" -- and Griffin clearly gets it.  \n \nI not only recommend this place, but I'll see you there next time I am in Vegas."

We thought about going to Heritage but I heard this place was more lively. We got there around 6:30 to have a couple drinks before 7. The hostess was so lovely, she greeted us with a warm smile and didn't rush to seat us. We seat in the lounge at first in one of the circle tables in the front that overlooks the casino floor, the perfect spot for people-watching. A tall brunette waitress came over with a Ipad to show us the specialty cocktails. I tend to like vodka and sweet drinks so the cocktail witness suggested the raspberry sin which came with real cotton candy!!! We enjoyed our drinks and even took shots with the table of guys next to us! After finishing a round of drinks, we moved into the intricate dinning room which featured breathe-taking architecture. The room is lightly-dimmed and the walls look layered rocks. Our server was so delightful, he was very knowledgeable about the menu. We had a couple starters. They had a quirky appetizer where you cook raw meat on a hot stone right at the table! The yellowtail sashimi was fresh and light. I loved it so much,  I wish I ordered two. For my entree I got a petit filet was came out seasoned perfectly. I usually order my steak med-rare, more on the rare side but restaurants can never give me that. Stack actually listened to what I wanted and I loved it, made me feel extra special since it was my birthday. For the table, we ordered a number of sides which include mac and cheese and tator tots which both rocked. For dessert, we had these adorable banana creampies. I'll definitely make Stack a spot each vegas trip. Overall, the experience was quiet memorable. From the hostess to our server, I can't wait to come back. Hot spot for sure, I'll recommend it to anyone who is willing to listen to me lol"

These are just a few words that describe our recent visit to STACK.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have been coming to STACK for the last 6 years to celebrate our anniversary. Every time we come we have never left disappointed.\n\nOur waiter for the night was Scott. It was an absolute pleasure to meet him. He greeted us immediately and asked if we had been there before. Once we told him our story, he smiled and asked if we minded if he went through the menu with us or if we would like to browse for ourselves. We appreciated him asking so much that we told him to \"Go for it!\" He discussed everything with finesse and sparked our interest on a few items. He was also kind enough to let us know that portions (depending on the dish) did run larger and could be split between two people.\n\nFor our starter we ordered the caesar salad (to split). WOW! The fresh brioche crouton paired very nice with the housemade ceasar dressing. The lettuce was crisp and the freshly cracked pepper just topped it all off.\n\nFor our Entree's we enjoyed the 14oz Brooklyn filet and the, what we like to call, \"Flinstone\" tomahawke Steak. The giant bone makes it looks prehistoric. It's presentation is stunning. My Brooklyn filet just melted in my mouth with each bite. Both steaks are the best we have ever had and we've been to some pretty nice steak restaurants; Mastros, Sulivans, LG's Steak house just to name a few. And don't forget to ask for EXTRA peppercorn sauce. The steaks don't need it BUT this stuff is absolute HEAVEN. \n\nOur sides were the adult tater totes. They had the perfect amount of Brie cheese and bacon in them. We also had Mac-N-Cheese. The jumbo shells used made sure you got pieces of ham, peas and cheese sauce in every bite. Note: You can share each side between two people.\n\nOur Desert used to be the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e but they stopped making it. It was seriously the best and if you're reading this STACK please bring it back. One of the most unique Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9es we've ever eaten. \n\nAll in all this place is the best and we make it one the places we at no matter what when we are visiting Vegas. \n\nIt also doesn't hurt that my fianc\u00e9 proposed there either but that's another story for another time. ;-P"

She sexily seduced (okay, she goaded us) into taking jager shots with her.  She had one of my boys wrapped around her little finger just by saying he's the cutest one out of us (he's so not).  Because of that, he went back to the bar and bought drinks from her TWICE throughout out meal.  Chumps you say?  Maybe.  But it was FUN.\n\nI must admit that I had VERY low expectations from this place.  I mean, it's not celebrity chef endorsed, never seen it on any Food Channel or Travel Channel shows, never even HEARD of this place until we decided to eat here.  Stack blew my expectations out of the water!\n\nFood:  30oz steak advertised in front for $60 for 2 people.  Some of us got that.  Some of us (ok, me) got the 24oz cowboy steak which was just a smaller version of the special.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  The two types of sauces (peppercorn and red wine) was insanely flavorful.  Adult tater tots were good.  But the highlight for me was the kobe chili that came with the chili cheese fries.  I think I must have had half of that by myself.  One guy got the sea bass and risotto dish and loved it.  Everyone else got meat and enjoyed it.\n\nService during dinner was prompt and polite.  Everything came together (as it should) and piping hot.  And since they are owned by the same people, our waiter brought us line passes and VIP entry cards to Jet, the club at Mirage.  \n\nOverall, the food was classic with modern twist done right, service impeccable, and priced decently for what you get."

I think there was a mix up in the beginning because we got some appetizers that wasn't supposed to be included. \n\nChampagne: It was a bit dry but not bad. I'm pretty sure it's nothing fancy though. \n\nShared Appetizers: \n\nLobster Tacos: They were tiny but they were cute!!! It was a bit on the salty side but it was tasty. I don't recall tasting the grilled mango though. \n\nMiso Black Cod: Pretty good. I noticed that the pieces of fish were not size consistent though. It wasn't fishy at all. \n\nHot Rocks: Very tasty and fun! You get to cook you own piece of meat on hot rocks. Everyone at the table was having a blast with this. \n\nPigs in a blanket: The weakest of all the appetizers. I could make better at home. \n\nThe following 2 appetizers I believe were given to us by mistake. For a party of 7, we got 2 each of the 4 appetizers listed above. We only got 1 each for the below. I didn't think much of it at that time since I couldn't remember what was on the prix fixe menu. \n\nYellowtail Sashimi: Yum! I wish I could trade in both orders of pigs in a blanket for one more order of this. \n\nMiso Hibachi Skewers: I only had a piece of the chicken and it was delicious. The others had nice things to say about the beef and pork. \n\nEntree: \n\n9 ounce Petite Filet: My filet wasn't cooked medium. It was more on the medium rare side. A few others weren't cooked to specification either. The filet was tender and flavorful and although the creamy peppercorn and red wine shallot sauces weren't needed, it helped to cover up some of the redness in the meat LOL! I could eat it but I just didn't want to see it! \n\nSides: \n\nBaby vegetables: I love vegetables but omg, it was so salty. I got one serving and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. Either someone in the kitchen got salt happy or just hates the natural flavor of vegetables. \n\nFrench Fries: They had a nice kick of spice to it but too bad, they were also too salty. \n\nWhipped Potatoes: Not better than mom's, or my sister's....they lacked texture and flavor. \n\nDessert: \n\nJelly Doughnuts: I wasn't too impressed. It was too doughy and the vanilla sauce that came with it wasn't too impressive either. \n\nMini Key Lime Cheesecakes: Not bad, but nothing unique. \n\nMini Blueberry Cheesecakes: I prefer this one over the key lime. \n\nSuch a nice start to dinner with a great variety of creative appetizers (except for the pigs in a blanket) and a nice entree but the sides and dessert just couldn't keep up. I would give Stack a higher rating if they work on their sides and if they provided stronger or more creative desserts."

They were there when we needed them, and came by once to refill drinks.\n\nI have to say I was SUPER disappointed that no bread was brought out to the table. I can't think of one \"Fine-dining\" experience where I haven't had something small set at the table prior to ordering - heck, even Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden, and Lucille's smokehouse bring out something.\n\nShellfish Stack looked fantastic.  If any restaurant wins for presentation, Stack should definitely be recognized as a nominee.  Great-looking food served uniquely.   It wasn't the best seafood I've had, but can't complain.\n\nSteak was tasty, but I've had better (Gallagher's at NYNY has some great meat!).\n\nI thought for sure that the Adult Tater Tots would taste fantastic according to reviews and the server's suggestion, but to my surprise they tasted a bit undercooked and as though they'd been sitting out for too long before being served.  But the baked mac & cheese was yummy!\n\nDessert was also okay... and not too pricey.\n\n\nOVERALL - If you want to experience a restaurant with different presentation, try this.  If you want good food at a good price, try another restaurant.  Our bill was about $160 bucks (with only two mixed beverages).... even Morton's - which me and my date agreed is much better - isn't this expensive."

We were absolutely not disappointed.  It's expensive, $200 for just the two of us, but who cared.\n\nWe started with Hot Rocks appetizer which is fun if nothing else.  Several slices of paper thin steak which has been marinated and then you cook it yourself on the super hot rocks they deliver to your table.  Tastes good, doesn't fill you up and has the fun factor on it's side.\n\nWe split a salad, don't make the mistake of trying to eat an entire one yourself if you want to finish your meal.  Hubby had a steak which he said was so tender you could almost cut it with a fork and a side of whipped garlic potatoes.  I had sea bass which was amazing but the real star of the dish was the risotto under it.  Lobster risotto which was creamy and so good with chunks of lobster.\n\nThen of course we had to have dessert even though by this time I could hardly move.  They have a sampler to share which has bites of everything.  While we couldn't finish it, was fun to try.\n\nThey've changed the menu, made it smaller and taken off a couple of my favorites but if they keep the sea bass, I'm good."

The chefs in the back definitely have a heavy hand and a desire for putting truffle oil on everything (which after three or four bites becomes nauseating).  The pigs in a blanket were gleaming from the massive amount of butter, my surf and turf too salty, the fries loaded with pepper and mac and cheese tasted like cardboard soaked in truffle oil. I think the draw to this beehive styled Restaurant is the celebrity sightings. I saw a couple of D-listers and two LA Lakers basketball players during my visit. If you're into that I guess you can get past the bad food by hanging out at the bar and looking out into the dark dining room. It'll achieve your wish and save you from the sickening food."

We ate the rest in the morning to cure the hangover and it was just as good. That's when you know you have quality beef...when you can eat it hours later and it's still as tender when served. Comes with potato gratin which is awesome but like other reviewers you must try the pigs in a blanket appetizer, or if you don't want an appetizer, go for the jelly filled donuts for dessert.

I sat at the bar. I ordered the Surf and Turf from the full menu. The Surf was the size of my left forefinger and I do not have large fingers. It was way over cooked and was flavorless. The Turf was a hockey puck sized piece of beef, more like 5 oz. at best, tough and gristly with no discernible beef taste. I had the Adult Tater Tots on the side, which were regular Tater Tots with some cheese infused into them. Oh, there was some other thing on the plate which might have contained some potato product. \n\nThe bill for this \"feast\" came to $74. I had one bottle of Stella Artois. I left a $10 tip only because this gorgeous lady bartender was so nice. \n\nThe place WAS packed! The kitchen may have been overwhelmed, but that is no excuse for serving up a lousy meal.

I read on Yelp to ask for them, because they don't automatically give them to you. So we asked for them, and the mgr (?) said sure - it's not something that they bring out normally, but there's no charge. Well they look good, but boy, I could have used them as doorstops. Ours were extremely over baked, dry and hard. We picked them apart and only ate the insides and left a crusty massacre in the basket; they probably thought, why did they ask for it if they weren't going to eat it ? Oh well that's okay, we had enough in our stomachs anyway.

It was served with two different steak sauces, one was peppercorn based, the other was based on a red wine reduction.  I preceded the main course with an EXCELLENT mixed green salad, and I had the steak accompanied with their whipped potatoes.\n\nMy ONLY complaint is a minor one.  Although I do expect to pay dearly at a premium steak house (and Stack qualifies as a premium steak house in my estimation), I do miss the days where one could eat economically in Las Vegas. On this trip I've learned that those days are LONG gone.  I guess the casinos are no longer bringing in the money the way they used to, and they have to make money SOME how.\n\nIn any event, I do highly recommend Stack.

I think next time, I will pay the cab fare, go off the strip and save way more than the cost of the cab ride for an equally good dinner elsewhere."

The appetizer came with three small gyros (we had a group of three so it worked out perfectly). Hands down the best gyro I've ever had. My only complaint would be portion size. For $19, you'd think you'd be getting more.\n\nSeabass: Delicious! Came with a lobster risotto with actual chunks of lobster. I did have one problem with the seabass: it was a tad undercooked so I had the chef throw it back on the grill. They re-plated my dish and threw in extra lobster. Minus the mishap, the dish was great. \n\nCountry Potato Gratin: My friends and I split this. I'd say it was pretty standard but still yummy.\n\nWarm Chocolate Cake: Good! Not particularly memorable but we enjoyed it.\n\nMy friends ordered the Petite Filet and the Pan Roasted Chicken. They both loved their dishes especially my friend who ordered the steak. We also ordered a bottle of white wine. \n\nAs you'd expect at a place like this, service was fantastic. The atmosphere was cool too.\n\nI think our total bill totaled $315 after tax and tip. Normally we wouldn't spend that much on one dinner but when in Vegas... Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to eat, I'd definitely suggest checking out Stack."

I'm guessing they don't care because it's a one time tourist kind of place, BUT, I definately wouldn't go back.  It's sad too because the place is really gorgeous and the food was good, not incredible, but good and substantial.  The attitude thrown by some of the service staff, especially one named Jeff was unbelievable.  I find it funny that someone who is serving me is throwing 'tude.  Either that or the guy is just dummer than my pet rock.  One of the other servers was nice enough, but they work in \"teams\" as they call it so it's someone different every step of the way and you keep having to remind them of what you ordered, what special request you had, that you have a open bottle of wine that you'd really like to drink but they took somewhere, etc. etc. etc. That said, there are so many nice places in Vegas to dine, I'd skip this one.....NEXT!"

The catch was that everyone would have a pre-fixed menu - a set price of $65 and no one could be late. I even had to sign a contract, choose the menu that I wanted and was told that 'Stephanie's Bachelorette Party!' would be at the top of every menu. \n\nWe rushed across the strip to make it in early, paid a lot of money on transportation. When we arrive, we were treated like every other guest. Considering that we had such a large party and that all 16 of us were going to pay $65+, shouldn't we have been treated better? $65.00 x 16 = $1,040.00 and that doesn't include tax, gratuity and alcoholic drinks. \n\nWe were sat at a table in the very front, a table that every guest has to pass to get to their seat - ANNOYING!\n\nWe began to review the menus. Every menu was different! None of which had my name of it. Anyways, no one came to take our order, no one refilled our water. It was terrible. \n\nWe finally ordered - nothing was happening. After an hour of sitting there, we decided to get up and find our server (who was MIA). FINALLY - they brought us a salad, an hour later. \n\nAfter the salad, still no action going on, no drinks, nothing. We asked for the Manager, the manager was MIA. It took us 20 minutes to locate him and when we did, we just decided that it was so ridiculous, we needed to leave. \n\nWe ended up going to bar and having some pretty good burgers that we received in 8 minutes. \n\nDon't go here, if you want to have a fun and fast experience with a group of friends."

We were shown to a table and started off with an appetizer. The Hot Rock! I've been to places where you have table side preparation but nothing quite like this, it was amazing! Literally a huge hot stone and thinly marinated slices of sirloin which sear on both sides for 2 seconds! Simply Amazing! Great Steak too, I ordered the 20 oz bone in Tomahawk Steak! From the Preparation to the Sides absolutely delicious. great atmosphere, stunning decor, light new age appetizers, and mouth watering steaks. Great experience!"

I enjoyed a heavenly egg white omelette at Stack along with a soy latte (soy milk is a rare find in Vegas). The potatoes/home fries were prepared brilliantly; seasoned to perfection and not at all greasy or overwhelming. The cheese was delicately melt atop the omelette which I've never seen before. It made for the perfect distribution of cheese taste. \n\nThe bartender/waiter (we had to sit at the bar) was attentive and thoughtful. He went in the back to dig up soy milk for me and provided us with to-go cups of ice water to withstand the rigors of our shopping trip in Ceasar's Forum. (He offered, we didn't ask).  \n\nOverall, it was a wonderful non-gourmet experience and by far superior to any other fast, American style restaurant we tried while in Vegas. Highly recommended!"

Written by our server.  To thank us for coming.  WOW.\n\nThe customer service here was amazing.  We had two servers at our table and a number of other people waiting on our table.  They brought out the food quickly, cleaned things up quickly, and changed our plates/utensils for the new dishes.  \n\nWe came here without a reservation so the wait was 45 minutes on a Saturday night.  We spent the time walking around and playing a few things before going in so the wait really wasn't a big deal.  I had a prosecco at the bar which was not bad and my boyfriend had Black on THE ROCKS...like literally all rocks.  Not a big deal either.  \n\nStack's menu is relatively simple and easy to navigate.  I liked that each dish was small so my boyfriend and I shared everything.  First we had the Hot Rocks which was amazing!!!!  They bring this hot black rock to your table and I think 7-8 slices of thinly sliced sirloin.  You're supposed to cook the sirloin just 1 minute on each side.  That might be overdoing it a bit too so it's really quick.  THen we had the Grilled Meat Ball Pizza.  Not your average pizza.  The bottom was a herby cracker and it had a sliver of meatball on each piece.  Not bad though.  This came with 8 pieces.  We had the lobster main plate which was quite delicious.  The lobster was a smaller lobster but it was cooked just right and very tender.  We had the adult tater tots which were amazing!!!!!!  They were hollow with bacon and melted brie inside.  I think there were 6 of these.  For veggies, we had the sauteed spinach which was nothing special but complimented the meal well.  \n\nOur meal was $120 but it was quite a significant tip for to thank them for the service.  I definitely want to come back here and I recommend it.  \n\nThe food is probably a 4 I would say."

I don't think we would be eating here if we couldn't afford an iPad. Anyway...\n\nWe were able to place reservations with this restaurant same day and they were very prompt in seating us on a Saturday evening. The place was not packed. They took into consideration the fact that we had a concert to go to later that evening and served our food quickly. \n\nWe skipped appetizers and got the Berrylicious cocktail, the braised Atlantic salmon, adult tater tots, mac & cheese, and the ultimate Kobe burger. All of it was good. The adult tater tots were unique and delicious. The salmon was perfectly cooked. Order the Kobe beef burger medium. I didn't get to try dessert, but their dessert menu had over 6+ items and were browsable through that iPad I mentioned earlier, you know, the one we were \"trying\" to steal.\n\nI think I would definitely come back here for a special occasion. It is somewhat pricey, with the Atlantic salmon be $39, but it was definitely good. Our bill totaled approximately $145 including tip. Hopefully, they don't think we are thieves next time!"

Such as when a server spilled pasta with truffle oil all over my brand new silk dress and instead of offering to have it dry cleaned, told me to go the Mirage gift shop for a Tide Stick. Wasn't even my pasta. Didn't even apologize. And of course this came after we left a 25% tip! Then when I contacted customer service to see if they would reimburse my dry cleaning expenses (had to have it cleaned three times to get the stain out), I got no response. On top of all this, I was hosting a big (& expensive) dinner event and nothing that was pre-arranged with the restaurant came into fruition. In other words, they dropped the ball (or the pasta) again and again. \n\nIn terms of food, they are okay to good, but mostly mediocre given the quality and prices. The best items are the cheesy buttery ones, and what doesn't taste good with lots of cheese and butter? Needless to say, Stack does not stack up."

From the start, Steve was a disappointment, after being seated in a awkward booth directly across another party.  For a romantic dinner, you don't want to be looking at the adjacent table.  After asking Steve for a side by side table he said those were reserved for parties of 4.  The entire time we were there (7:00 pm to 9:00 pm)the restaurant was 20% occupied.  So basically we could have been accommodated.  Not sure if it was because we were a same sex couple or if Steve was being a jerk.\n\nFinally, we had great service from Kyle who made the night salvageable.

The food was oh so delicious. This place has become my new favorite place in Vegas! Crabmeat tacos are a must try for anyone dining here- they are unbelievably delicious!!\nCame here for husband's birthday several days ago and we're still talking about how good everything was. The interior is unlike any other steakhouse and the presentation took our breaths away. Some of the reviews here say, overpriced, but look- this is a STEAKHOUSE. It's not a sterile, stuffy kind of steakhouse, it is trendy and fun. And it's not overpriced when compared to other steakhouses in vegas.\nFor starts we ordered drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. After being seated we ordered cucumber martinis ($19) and the crab tacos for appetizer ($19). The crab tacos are wonderful but small so don't think it'll be enough for your meal. For the meal, I ordered the Pan Roasted Chicken ($28) with baby veggies instead of green beans which they were more than happy to change for me and my husband ordered the 24oz Tomahawk Rib Eye ($54) with a side of the Bacon and Brie Tator Tots ($10). The food Wowed us, everything that was brought out made me want to take a picture of it. The server Deena was super nice and the place couldn't have been more perfect plus they had real candles on the table which was the cherry on top. I highly recommend this for anyone celebrating a birthday or who just wants to have a great time at a superior steakhouse."

The jelly doughnut and mocha pudding thing were super yummy and so was the Swiss jelly roll. The bread pudding was not good. At all. And I love bread pudding.\n\nWe also had cocktails. My husband had some hot martini (I 4get what it was called but it was served with 2 big red peppers attached to the martini glass). He said it was OK but it did have some heat to it.

Without reservations and only part of our party ordering dinner, we were allowed to sit anywhere in the bar area.  This worked out well with a few large tables that sit about six that were available for everyone.\n\nThe BF was starving and the Prix Fixe special (5 pm to 6 pm) was looking rather appetizing.  They offered two appetizers to choose from, and he went for the Hot Rocks ($17), which is advertised as \"Thinly Sliced Sirloin, Tableside Preparation.\"  The waiter comes by with a plate of hot rocks, and then another plate of about six slices of marinated sirloin.  You're then supposed to place the meat on the hot rock for a few moments to cook it.  The meat tasted so good that we barely seared it as the meat was pretty flavorful on the rear end!\n\nOf the two entrees, he chose the 9 oz. Petite Filet Bone-Out ($40), medium rare.  It looked rather small when it arrived, which a single potato chip on top of it.  But we realized with its thickness, that it was actually a hearty piece.  It came with two sauces, both which were very tasty.\n\nOf the two dessert choices, he went for the highly recommended Jelly Doughnut \"Munchkin\" Holes...mmmmmm jelly ($8).  It came with about four doughnut holes filled with red jelly and a vanilla bean dipping sauce.  The BF would have loved it if the vanilla bean sauce was already inside the doughnut holes!\n\nOur friend and I decided to try drinks from their Cocktail Menu.  She went for the Impeared ($12), \"Grey Goose Poire, Fresh Pear Nectar, Muddled Pear & Sage.\"  It was complimented with an Asian pear slice and was really tasty.  (She actually ordered it again, but the second one was stronger and not as sweet.)  I ordered the Bellini ($12), \"Absolut Peach, Fresh White Peach Puree & Sparkling Wine.\"  Really good stuff!  It made me want to buy some of this stuff and make it at home all the time.  What a treat!  \n\nWe shared the Mixed Greens Salad ($12), \"Teardrop Tomatoes, Avocado, Shallot Vinaigrette.\"  When I told the waitress we were going to share it, I was surprised to see two plates of salad to arrive.  The waitress confirmed that it was indeed one order split in two.  What  a generous portion of salad!  We were all surprised and it was quite good too!  The salad was dressed perfectly, not too little and not too much. And the avocado, tomatoes, and cucumbers all complimented it so perfectly.  (If we had each ordered our own salad, I think we wouldn't have made it to dessert then!)\n\nFor dessert, we also ordered the Mini Key Lime Pies ($8) with \"Margarita\" Sorbet.  However, our friend only saw the \"sorbet\" part and didn't even realize she ordered the pies!  It came with three miniature pies with a meringue topping that was pretty good.  The yummy sorbet sat on sweet pineapple bits that complimented the dessert perfectly!  The sweet crispy thing on top tasted great as well! \n\nOverall, we were pretty impressed with the food.  I have eaten at FIX over at The Bellagio, and recalled there were some memorable bites from their menu too.\n\nService was pretty good. The waitresses were attentive and 'stacked.'  I think they were training a new waitress, so there was an extra set of hands available.  I would definitely return to STACK again, whether it's to enjoy a couple of their cocktails, grab a quick bite, or split a dessert.\n\nSidenote: There's a yellow lighting issue at this restaurant, which makes everything you order look yellow.  After taking pictures of the food with a flash, then you can really see how great everything looks!  (And of course I posted the pics of the food in the business profile!)"

Second, the food quality here matches the price and actually is a good value compared to other places.

My wife enjoyed the lobster but she did mention that the king crab was a little too overwhelming. Service was good but I felt that the servers were very busy that they had empty plates every time they'd check on our table. I would recommend this place if you've already tried 2-3 other similar steakhouses. Overall, it was a mediocre dining experience."

I had the cowboy steak (great texas, fatty deep flavor), a buddy had a petit filet (a less fatty more refined and restrained flavor) and a few other guys had a Brooklyn cut, lamb shanks etc.  Great meat, cooked really dead on. \n\nThey offer a few sauces (wine reduction and I forgot the other one), not only did I mow through the meat, it tasted so great, not one sauce touched it until the very last pieces were going to be eaten.\n\nWe had some great sides, spinach, the crunchy truffle fries, halibut sashimi, fries with cheese and a beefy chili on the side.  All very tasty and we all shared them family style. Plus their wine selection was on par and my friends who did drink put down two bottles and really enjoyed it.\n\nThe service was very attentive and although they were short staffed as a bunch of new tables came in towards the end of the meal, we totally understood as our bill was slightly delayed.\n\nDefinitely on my list of places to come back to when I head back to Vegas."

Overhyped app because of the sizzling rocks. Sashimi tacos were amazing with crispy wonton 'tortilla.' Wedge salad was crunchy, cold and delicious! The burrata appetizer had a great presentation in a glass jar with crostini toast, ahi poke served with crispy rice crackers were all so good. The cesar salad was crisp and cold and perfect. I ordered scallops, with crispy rice and bok choy - all served under each scallop, making for a perfectly tasty bite. Everyone raved about their dishes. I tasted the sea bass with lobster risotto and it tasted fresh and rich. Lots of wine and cocktails- we went through a few bottles.

It was also LV Restaurant Week so most of us decided to do the special menu.\n\nHubby got the Hot Rocks appetizer, which are thin slices of beef that you cook at the table on a hot stone. It was fun to watch hubby try to cook with chop sticks! Regardless, he seemed to love it. My dad and I both got the Buffalo Rock Shrimp. They were breaded shrimp with buffalo sauce and blue cheese dip. I love all things buffalo so I gobbled them up!\n\nFor dinner, hubby got lamb with potato gnocchi, mom got sea bass, and dad and I got short ribs with polenta. My short ribs were tender and delicious. The polenta was also delicious. Mom's sea bass was HUGE- she gave me a bite and it was perfectly cooked. The smartest person in our party, though, was hubby. His lamb was falling off of the bone and the gnocchi was amazing. His dish also had tons of mushrooms in it, which I LOVE. I was definitely jealous of hubby's dinner!\n\nFor dessert, we had peanut butter and jelly chipwiches. They were peanut butter cookie ice cream sandwiches with peanut butter chips, jelly sauce, and chocolate sauce. I would eat these every day if possible!\n\nThe ambience is really cool, although the music was a little too loud for my parents.

Couple more notches down, the restaurant will be practically pitch black! I have no problem with this whatsoever, but my parents weren't a fan of. SOOO.....just an FYI.\n\nService was tentative throughout the night. Our waiter was very accommodating. The SEABASS entr\u00e9e is what he recommended but my dad already had his heart set on that. That dish was freaking amazing!!! Sea bass was tender, sauce was full of flavor, had a few lobster bits with risotto. Yum!!\n\nMommy ordered a petite filet, medium rare. It was cooked to her liking. She also got a side of baby vegetables. The vegetables were fresh and it wasn't soggy. Nothing is worse than soggy ol vegetables.\n\nI ordered the Lobster Curry with rice. Curry was not spicy at all; it was more sweet, if anything. It came with lots of big lobster chunks......they definitely do not skim you on your lobster meat! Also came with cucumbers, carrots and mushrooms. (see pic attached.) I wouldn't mind getting this entr\u00e9e again.\n\nPrices weren't too bad here. For 3 entrees and 1 side, our total came out to about $165. Give or take with tax + tips. Yes, I know there are plenty of other restaurants to choose from on The Strip, but if for whatever reason you're stuck at the Mirage, Stack Restaurant is a safe bet. Their appetizers looked good too.

It's dim, but we had no problem reading the menu or seeing our food -- if you do struggle, I suggest going to an optometrist. It also isn't nearly as overcrowded as reviews led me to expect ... yes, the tables are relatively close together, but it is absolutely NOT like dining with the people at the table next to you, or anything like that.  I felt the dimness and the layout made it actually kind of cozy.  The music was nice and not too loud, but not yawn-inducing either.\n\nThe cocktails were delicious and nicely strong. \n\nThe food was delicious!  We had hot rocks as the appetizer, and despite my klutziness trying to get the little pieces of steak onto the rock with my chopsticks, we had a lot of fun, and it was also really, really tasty steak with the marinade.

The steaks and the sauces they come with are amazing, and the tater tots were really delicious (bacon and brie in tater tots is a brilliant idea!).  For dessert, we had the jelly donut holes.

And the red wine reduction they gave us to pour on top, I didn't want to stop. \n\nAnd finally, a good meal is not complete without thanking the amazing dude who suggested it all: Vince. This server was AMAZING. With my husband and I working in customer service, this guy and his level of service was unparalleled. I really hope if you eat here you get a chance to have him as your server, you will not be disappointed!!"

The food was wonderful gastropub fare such as kobe chili cheese fries as well as normal steakhouse favorites like the 9 oz petit filet an a half lobster tail surf & turf. Of course, in true Vegas style, the prices are ridiculously high for any other market but pretty average in Sin City.\nThe service was absolutely atrocious though and made the  entire experience unpalatable. When asked about sides, our server only said it was a la carte and the sides were enough for two people to share. After ordering almost $100 in sides, we soon found out that many of the entrees came with at least side. Drink refills were non-existent. We were trying to get to a club and, three hours into our meal, I practically had to beg for my check. Overall, the food and atmosphere would be worth the trip if the service wasn't the worst I've had in a very long time!"

I added the shrimp scampi for $25.  Although you only get 3 large shrimp, they were delish in a wonderful parmesan/alfredo-like sauce.  Our appetizers were fantastic!  The oysters had a delicious layer of pesto-like seasoning on top.  The two lobster rolls were just the right size and served with seasoned chips (although I would have eaten many more if the plate came with more).  The whipped potatoes are \"better than your mother's,\"  and did come close to being better than my mom's!!  Try the creme brulee for dessert - you will be satisfied!"

The atmosphere and vibe are premium, and the interior is beautiful, \nOur waiter said it was made out of African Mahogany, which he said is an endangered wood species. Insane.\nAll the food we ordered was amazing. For the main course we had a 24oz steak and some chicken which came with 'Whipped Potatoes' (much better than mashed!) This was more than enough to share with 4 people, but to go all out we ordered some appetizers and a desert. \nThe Adult Tater tots were probably my favorite appetizer out of the three we ordered (meatballs, mac and cheese) but all three were delicious. \nFor desert we wanted something on the lighter side because we were all very full, so our waiter recommend the strawberry shortcake type desert. It was very fancy as there were small marshmallows individually toasted to a golden brown on top of a perfect ball of vanilla ice cream. Totally worth it!\nThe service is also great, as everyone makes sure you don't have any dirty plates or silverware laying on your table. \nThe only thing holding this back from a 10/10 experience was that I checked in with our waiter on Yelp to receive two shots on the house towards the beginning of our meal, which he seemed to forgot about it as we had to flag someone down to remind them. It wasn't too much of an issue as the drink in the end was delicious, and was sweet enough to be a desert drink. \n9.7/10, would come back."

Yellowtail Crunch and the Hot Rocks(sirloin you cook yourself) are a fantastic start. The Pan Seared Dumplings are good as well. If they have the crab sticks( i believe that was the name) order them! Amazing!!  Now to the salads. Love their garbage salad, very unique combinations of different favors. Their Caesar is good as well...VEry pricey on both $15-18 !  Now to the main course:  The ultimate steak for 2 is 40oz of incredible meat!! It comes with delicious Potatoes and 2 amazing sauces. Its a whopping $94. Their filet is very good! The Seabass has a very tasty broth over it and the Kobe Burger with Onion Rings is excellent as well. For dessert I have only tried the key lime pie and it was very good. In conclusion, the service is always excellent at Stack with attention to every detail. For large parties they have a curtained area in the back that can seat 20 or so. The prices are very expensive but the food is excellent and those steak sauces!!! mmmmmmmm!!  \n\\"

Now I don't expect a free sundae like it's an Applebees or anything, but not a single person acknowledged the birthday.  We were sent to the bar after not getting seated for our 8pm reservation. It took them 15 minutes (up until the time we were seated) to get drinks. Then, there was a confusing 5 min conversation about transferring the charges to our table. My guess is they found 4 of the most attractive women they could find that never worked a day in food service, and hired 2 as hostesses and the other 2 as bartenders.  The service staff at the table was ok, but when the bill is $300 for 3 people, I expected more.

You will get several thinly sliced pieces of meat, marinated in a DELCIOUS sauce. You are served a scorching hot rock in a basket, and you cook this little mini-steaks yourself. Delectable. The Miso Black Cod Lettuce cups are crisp and refreshing, and the Japanese Spicy Crab are to die for! Little cubes of flavorful spicy crab are served on a crispy rice-crouton square, served with a pleasantly spicy/tangy sauce. If lobster is your thing, the Lobster Taco's are amazing.\n\nI have ordered the Petit Filet three times so far. Always tender, served with two of their signature steak sauces. So. Good.  As an entree choice. they also serve a delicious Penne dish with parmesan, proscuitto and black truffle. SO decadent and satisfying. More than enough to share with a pal.\n\nTry the Seabass in Lobster Risotto. Ohmygoodness. That's all I can say. One of the most amazing seabass dishes I have ever been served. \n\nAs a side, I have tried the XL Twice Baked potato. SPLIT THIS with someone, it is much too much for one person. Seriously. The Sautteed Spinach is also quiet delicious.\n\nDessert:\nYou can't leave with out trying the Jelly Doughnut \"Munchkins\". Warm jelly filled doughnut holes with a creamy sweet dipping sauce. Trust me, you will want to rub these all over your body. The warm chocolate cake is very good, as well as the cherry creme brulee."

I do love the dark wood all over decor. \n\nThe mister and I came here for happy hour right before the Beatles love show. We were in the mood for drinking and small bites. I was a bit daring with a vodka double on the rocks and the mister got a red wine. Of course, a lightweight like myself can't handle a double vodka even though it's priced half off. So I drank most of the red wine. There was a mini menu of appetizers to choose for happy hour. It wasn't much of a selection but we choose the hot wings and fish tacos. It claims that the prices for these appetizers were at half priced. I was like, it is really at $8 -$10 for these appetizers. But the mister assured me that those are the happy hour prices. A bit pricey in my book. The hot wings were very miniature and spicy and the fish tacos were grilled fish fillets served in lettuce leaves. They were both delish that we ordered them again! \n\nThe waitress that served us was really great. To my surprise, the waitresses were dressed in sexy LBD (Little black dress). A times, they looked like that they were there to party instead of serving food. I like the atmosphere, where it feel like pre-party before the PARTY. I like the Stack bar but do not like to be squished so look for a little breathing space."

I've never eaten at Kokomos, but after eating at Stack, I'm happy with our decision.\n\nWhen we made the reservation we asked how long a typical dining experience is, as we had show tickets.  We were told an hour and a half, which is fine with me, I enjoy a leisurely meal.\n\nI ordered a glass of Prosecco, which the BF upgraded to a bottle and shared with me.  We had the spicy crab appetizer, which was we both really enjoyed, the textures, temperatures, and flavors were all perfect.\n\nThe showpiece of our meal was definitely the \"steak for two,\" a 40oz porterhouse, served with whipped potatoes and two sauces.  We figured, if we were both going to order a steak, it would be more cost effective to order the one.  We were right.  And it was delicious.  It came sliced, so we could grab one piece at a time instead of trying to share off of the same plate while cutting from the bone.  The sauces were both great, the BF thought the peppercorn sauce was good, but too sweet to be called peppercorn. \n\nWe skipped dessert, even though the selections were all delicious looking.\n\nMy only complaint about Stack is the seating.  We were sat in a corner booth, and I was looking directly at the table next to us, which was seated so close that we could hear their conversation.\n\nAll in all, it was a delicious experience."

This time she planned a big shindig in LAS. She wanted to go here to Stack. One of her top 5 restaurants. So, of course, I agreed. I've never been here. But it made her top 5 so...\n\nWhat an amazing place!!! The decor was beautiful. Dark woods and a very romantic ambiance. Candle lit tables and a very attentive wait staff. Our waiter, Manny, was amazing. Helpful and knowledgeable of his menu.  \n\nWe had the meatballs to start. Get them!  I'm not going to describe. Just get. We then had the Caesar salad.   Which was totally \"homemade\". You could actually taste the anchovies!  Amazing.  \n\nMy girl had the sea bass on a bed of lobster risotto. My word. So delicious. Sea bass cooked to perfection. Flaky and juicy. But the risotto? Wow. I mean wow. Chunks of lobster with every bite.  I mean my girl said she'll dream about this dish until she has it again. \n\nI had the 14oz Brooklyn filet with whipped, not mashed, potatoes. Filet cooked to a medium. Which in retrospect I'll get medium rare next time. Not that this wasn't good medium. It was great!  Juicy and tender. On the bone no less. Which just adds to the flavor!!!  Served with a red wine reduction and peppercorn barenaise sauce. This truly enhanced the flavor. Didn't take away or overpower the meat. The whipped potatoes you ask?  Truly wonderful. I asked my girl to make these next time we have steak and potatoes. She said yes. Of course she did. She loved them as much as I did. \n\nAfter all this we were spent. Then Manny brought out our Birthday desserts. Vanilla ice cream with \"happy birthday \" written in chocolate. Truly a simple but heartfelt gesture on the part of the Stack staff. Meant so much to us. \n\nAll in all. Go!  Go and enjoy Stack. The staff wonderful. The food to die for!!!"

Evidently, if you order from the prix fixe menu, there is no bread service.  I didn't notice this until I was almost finished with my steak, so I didn't bother to ask then.  The steak came with two thin waffle potato chips.  That's it--no side of any kind, not a carrot slice, one broccoli floret, nothing!  I found it amazing when the server suggested I might want to order a side so I had enough to eat.  I did order a side of mashed potatoes at $8.  That sort of negates the prix fixe of early dining.\n\nWhen I first arrived the waitress brought me a \"new\" prix fixe menu at $59.99 that I should consider as it would entail more food.  This is not on the Mirage website.  I did notice there was more food served including sides.  It seems to be a bait and switch scheme, but maybe no.\n\nI considered giving Stack a 2 rating but the food was all so good, I just couldn't.  I do know I won't be returning here.\n\nEdit:  You know, I have to give it a 2 star rating.  This just doesn't deserve 3 stars.  One star deleted."

But the service was horrible. Juan had an assistant, so we expected good service. By the time we ordered our food, we never saw Juan or his assistant again. My boyfriend's drink was gone before he received his steak and he was never offered another drink-- probably because we never saw Juan again! My boyfriend ordered his steak medium, I ordered mine Medium rare, and his was cooked less than mine! It was definitely rare. We couldn't say anything because like I said, we never saw our server! I was a server for 5 years thru college, so I know the two bite-two minute rule. I am honestly appalled that nobody checked up on us or asked how our food was; especially since our steaks were $50+. I want servers to work for their tip; they can't just expect it... Too bad Juan didn't work harder.  And it's not like it was too busy and he was apologetic; that'd be a different story. Would like to return to enjoy the food again (mine was cooked deliciously) but the service is a huge part to the dining experience. Oh yea, the guy next to us had to send his steak back three times; so obviously one of the chefs needs to get his stuff together."

Why did we even make reservations if we didnt get seated for 30 minutes - finally seated at 8:35pm... we had to rush through our dinner to make it to the show on time\naside from that - the food was really delicious and our server was super friendly (the only saving graces)"

On the weekend nights there is also a DJ in the restaurant.  It's considered casual but the price tag is more upscale. Expect to spend $50 + depending on drinks and appetizers you order.\n\nAs far as appetizers go,the rock shrimp are delicious! For show get the hot rocks where you can cook thin slices of sirloin at the top. Pretty tasty too! The ahi tuna tartar is also very tasty.\n\nAs far as entrees 2 of my favorites are the sea bass and the Kobe burger.  If you really want to go all out get the filet Oscar style! The lump crab is delicious.\n\nThis is a great place to eat for birthday parties, bachelor/bachelorette parties or any big parties where you are celebrating an event and looking to have fun."

            "review": "Came to Stack for dinner with a bunch of friends.  Stack is an upscale New American/Steakhouse restaurant located inside the MGM.  The two things I've noticed right off the back is that Stack is very stylish and also very dark.  Everyone at our table was complaining about how dark the place Stack is. \n\nWe didn't have reservations but was still able to walk in on a Saturday Night at 8PM.  As mentioned before Stack is New American Cuisine with several steak options too.  Soe we are talking about Kobe Beef Burgers, Lobster Tacos, Steak Fries with Truffles, and Tater tots with Brie and bacon and the prices here reflect the high end items too.  Prices start at around $15 for most of their menu options and if you're looking for a steak here they start at $40.  Also, everything here is served ala carte, so you're going to have to pay extra for sides. \n\nLooking over the menu decided to get Grilled Meatball Pizza and other people got the Pork Chops, the Sirloin Steak, and the Kobe Beef Burger along with Mac & Cheese, Wings, Tater Tots, and Steak Fries as sides.  When we got the food, it came out in a reasonable amount of time and everything came out at once. \n\nMy Pizza wasn't anything I expected.  It was a super thin crust pizza (we're talking about the thickness of a cracker) cut into about 8 2 inch squares with just one meatball (about the size of a sweedish meatball) in the center of each \"slice\".  The portion size was decent, the sauce had a nice bit of spice too, the kobe beef meatball was good and decently flavored, but I still can't get over the cracker they used as a crust.  Just not my thing and was thinking more of \"pizza\" crust than a Ritz Cracker crust. \n\nI tried all of the appetizers and by far the best was Steak Fries.  It wasn't the fries itself, but the sauce that came with it was excellent.  It was almost like a chipotle/mayo taste to it and was excellent.  The wings were good, but very small.  They were more like wing lollipops than your traditional wings.  The seasoning they used was good.  The mac and cheese was good, nothing mind blowing but good.  And finally the tater tots, to be honest they reminded me too much of what I had from the school cafeteria and while you did get hints of the brie and bacon, I just thought they were just ok. \n\nComments from the table pretty much ranged in the just OK area whether it was the Burger, Sirloin, or even the other guy that ordered the Pizza.  The guy who ordered the Pork, didn't like it and thought it was overcooked and tough to eat. \n\nThe service here is professional indifferent.  The waiter did spill water on me when trying to refill a glass and just kind of blew off as no big deal and of course on a scale of 1 - 10 I would rank it as a 4.  Yeah annoyed, but not pissed, probably would have been a two if the waiter wasn't so indifferent.  Also I noticed we didn't get bread and several other tables did, so not sure if you had to pay for it, or again the waiter being indifferent about it. \n\nMy share of the food came out to be about $40.  I'm sure I put in more than others, but WTF.  As to recommendation, to be honest the food was good, but I was hardly blown away especially at the prices you pay at.  I guess I feel the same way about Stack as the waiter felt about us, indifferent.  You could do better, but you could also do worst in Vegas, take it or leave it and from a meh feeling, Stack gets a 3 star rating."

We ate here because we had tickets to see the Beatles Love show & wanted to eat somewhere in the same hotel. We made a reservation beforehand but still had to wait 15 minutes. Normally I wouldn't mind, cause it's Vegas & you have to wait everywhere. But our reservation was for 5p, right when they opened for dinner service, & the restaurant was empty. Literally. We could see the entire place. \n\nThe service was mediocre at best. We told our waitress we needed a few more minutes to look over the menu, & she didn't return for 25. Same thing when we asked for the check. We were almost late for our show. All that being said, the spaghetti & meatballs were pretty tasty, & the portion was large. I won't be back though; I can pay the same amount for much better service elsewhere."

These were a tad spicier than they had to be. I like hot spicy wings as much as the next guy, but these seemed to go a little over the top to the point where they weren't that flavorful. They did come off the bone nicely though. Just be aware that these are more than medium hotness. My wife had the Brooklyn Filet (basically a bone-in filet mignon) which she thought was very tasty and cooked to her liking (she's not usually easy to please with steaks). I had the seabass on the lobster risotto, which was done well and tasty. It combines three of my favorite things. We also had the \"Adult Tater Tots\" which have a bacon flavor and have some brie inside. Maybe its just me, but the taste didn't quite add up to how good it sounded (or maybe the hot wings had killed my sense of taste by that point). Overall I would recommend it. It ranks slightly below some of my other favorite upscale Las Vegas Strip restaurants thus giving only 4 stars, but is still very solid and has a wide enough variety on the menu."

To begin with, the wine list had the wrong year for the wine we ordered. Second, I ordered the bone-in Ribeye; but about a half hour after getting our starters, the waiter said that they ran out of them. He said that a group of 18 guys, who came in after us, all ordered them, and the restaurant ran out. Then, when our entrees eventually came out, they brought three at a time, and about 5 minutes apart. The first three in our group were almost done with their entrees, when the side dishes eventually made their way to the table. The evening was a huge disappointment. To make things worse, they automatically tacked on a 18% gratuity since we had 9 in our party."

            "review": "I DON'T GET IT!!!!\n\nI know that this review is crazy long, but if I'm only going to give it one star, I want to explain why. \n\nMy husband and I are in our 40's, full time RVers, and have traveled to 41 of the lower 48 states. We've literally eaten almost everywhere, and eaten all different kinds of food, at all different price points, all across the nation. Prior to the RV thing, we lived in AZ, so two of our best friends from AZ came up to join us for the weekend. My girlfriend wanted to go to Giada, but they were booked, so I checked Yelp - SINCE I TRUST YOU GUYS - to find another option. Adult Tater Tots got my husband's attention, so I made a reservation. \n\nMy friends decided that what they really wanted was everything on the appetizer menu, so we just decided to get a bunch of those, and share everything, instead of doing real courses. Here's what we ordered:\n\n3 Manhattans: $19.00 each\nIced Tea: $4.00\nBottle of Zin $69.00\nWater: $7.00\nCrab Tacos: $23.00\nWings: $21.00\nOysters Rockefeller: $21.00\nAhi Tuna Tartare: $19.00\nAdult Tater Tots: $11.00\nPigs in Blankets: $17.00\nKobe Burger and Fries: $34.00\nDessert Sampler: $18.00\n\nPlus tax = $325.38\n\nManhattan: One of my husbands favorite drinks, and one of the best he's ever had. I know this, because I don't actually like them, but this one was fantastic. Worth $19? I'm not really sure.\n\nIced Tea:  it was tea. That's it. No interesting flavors or anything, and they couldn't seem to keep it filled. I was driving, so I wasn't drinking, and I know that this is the cheapest thing on the menu, but c'mon guys, somebody had to drive.\n\nZinfandel: can't really tell you about this one - my friends ordered the bottle and didn't mention anything about it. I didn't taste it, because I don't care for red wine. \n\nFiji Bottled Water:  we had to order this because (I don't know if you know this) Las Vegas is in the desert. Water is essential. The water glasses were about 6 ounces each, and when my husband asked if we could have a carafe at the table, we were told that they couldn't leave one. So he ordered a bottle. They couldn't keep my tea filled, and it was even worse with the water. \n\nFOOD: Presentation on EVERYTHING was beautiful, it all LOOKED great!\n\nCrab Tacos: 4 to an order, and they were teeny! Approximately 2 - 2 1/2\" long each. Maybe an inch and a half high. They were tasty, but completely unseasoned. It was crab, in a crispy taco shell, with a thin slice of jalape\u00f1o and a sprig of cilantro on top of each. Served with a side of salsa, which did not seem house made, but may have been. \n\nWings: Served \"lollipop style\" which means that I think that they were from the part of the wing with the two bones in it, but with only one bone and the meat pushed to the \"top\" - they looked like the \"drumstick\" ones, but tiny, once again. They were perfectly cooked, not dried out, which is impressive, considering their size. There were about a dozen, with two pieces each of celery and carrot and a side of blue cheese. They were buffalo wings, about medium spiciness. Again, nothing special. If you're looking for wings, Buffalo Wild Wings does a better, meatier job. \n\nOysters:  fine, but 5 small oysters, served with one tiny bottle of Tabasco and one lemon wedge. No crackers. \n\nAhi Tuna: in my opinion, the BEST THING we ate, and the most reasonable portion for the money. A bowl of cubed ahi (maybe about 3-4 ounces) atop cubed avocado, served with shrimp chips and soy sauce. \n\nTater Tots:  considering that everything we ate was so small, these were ginormous by comparison! 6 to an order, and about 2-3 times the size of an average tater tot. Yes, they were flavored with Brie and bacon, but I couldn't actually see either. There wasn't enough in there. Served with ketchup on the side. No house made dipping sauce or remoulade or anything, just plain ketchup. \n\nPigs in Blankets:  unfortunately, exactly what you're thinking. About a dozen Hillshire Farms tiny dogs wrapped in a small amount of puff pastry, served with French's mustard and Heinz ketchup. For $17.00. (If you're wondering what I was expecting, one of my favorite restaurants in the world is Odd Duck in Austin TX. There, they make a \"breakfast corn dog\" with house made chorizo and a Dijon mustard foam that's to die for. And I don't even like chorizo.)\n\nAfter that, the boys were still hungry, so they split the Kobe burger. The meat was amazing, and cooked to perfection (I did take a bite of my husband's half) but, at $34, it just came with plain old normal fries and ketchup. Not even garlic or anything on the fries to make them interesting. \n\nDessert sampler: buffet of tiny desserts. Fruit ones were good. \n\nMy husband asked why I only gave the restaurant one star. Here's the thing: the food was fine. Everything was cooked fine. But at these prices, the food was minuscule. And there was nothing spectacular about ANY component of anything. Which was a real bummer."

There were next to zero variables from this place that dissatisfied me. For what I was looking for, a cool delicious and upscale place to celebrate a birthday, I found what worked well. It is a very hip atmosphere, dim amber lighting a contemporary canyon motif radiating with electronic music from a house DJ. The food, expensive as a given, was very good. Just prepare to spend a lot of money on what is definitely worth it for how special a place it really is. Service is also top-notch, we didn't have to ask for a thing and the waiter certainly earned his generous tip. (Plus the tender behind the bar mixing drinks was adept.)\n\nif I had one observation it would be that it wasn't very crowded, given we ate on a Tuesday night at 9:15. If you are looking for a very lively bar scene you might wanna find many of the thousands of hip bars in Vegas. However it was quiet and intimate which allowed me to focus on my party members.\n\nEat here, you won't leave disapointed"

We decided to indulge.\n\nNow granted, I was definitely under the influence of alcohol by our 8 p.m. reservation, but the large filet I consumed was literally the best streak I've ever eaten. Grilled to a perfect medium-rare, super tender and with a tasty, but faint sauce that really allowed the meat to shine.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it was fucking expensive. But it's Vegas, go big or go home."

Even though the decor is very far from the typical pub with nice wood panels (stacks of wood, hence the name), menu is deliberately dominated by pub-like items like buffalo wings, onion rings and pigs in a blanket. Sharing is encouraged. They also offer steaks and other hearty main courses.\n\nThey have an original appetizer called Hot Rock which is a carpaccio style piece of seasoned and oiled beef which the patron cooks on err... an hot rock. Great taste and original. However, the chef should really reconsider the practice of serving Heinz ketchup and yellow mustard to go along the finger food. At least home made laternatives should be proposed. Wine list is decent."

Outstanding appetizer. Yes they really do lovingly massage every leaf with lemon juice. I had the salmon and my buddy the steak. Someone back there knows their way around a grill. \n\nWhat I liked most about this place, other than the food, the music was not blaring or intrusive.

Our bartenders (Justin if I recall), were great and very attentive.  \n\nWe got a dozen Kushi oysters ($4 each) and most were clean and was quite tasty.  The star of the appetizers was the hot rocks.  The beef is cut sashimi style and you lay it on the hot rock for 2-3 seconds each side and it is done.  Was it worth $22?  It sure was fun. \n\nI've stayed at Mirage many times and this was the first time here.  Mirage has many sit down restaurants (been to Pantry, Carnegie Deli, BLT Burger, Heritage Stack, and their buffet). Glad I stopped by here this time around.

She thought she married a man. Not a boy who weeps with each delicious bite. \nTheir wine list is fantastic too. And their desert. Oh, and it's at the Mirage, which is great for some after-dinner blackjack. You can hear the excited casino cheering from the restaurant. \nGo here."

I think it's more fun to come and order a few of their small things, such as the lobster tacos, brie and bacon tater tots, lettuce wraps, to just share with a large group. It was tons of fun to just get all the things and sample them all. I think its better for appetizers and what not rather then a full meal.\n\nMy only complaint was the service. When they neglected to bring us one of the things we order, we asked about it and still never received it. After we realized we had plenty of food we forgot about it. It was still on the bill and we reminded them kindly that it never came out and could they take it off the bill. Our waitress rudely stated that she would have to talk to her manager about it, and would let us know. what?????? Why would we pay for something we never received. Other then that the rest of our waiters were kind and very helpful!"

I tried to call to talk to the restaurant and they transferred me to their credit card dispute department, and I was on hold for 31 minutes during their stated business hours.  I never got to speak with anyone, but took a photo of my hold time total because I couldn't believe how long I was waiting and I wasn't confident anyone would ever pick up.  I decided to email them and I received an automated response that they would get back to me in 7-10 business days.  It is day 11, and I haven't received any response.  I finally had to dispute it with my credit card company.  I was shocked at the lack of response and unavailability of the credit card disputes department.  This type of thing has never happened to me before.  You would think management would take theft pretty seriously, but from the lack of response they seem ok with it.\n\nBasically, I am saying - don't go here because someone on the wait staff steals.  If you go, make sure you pay cash.  I don't like writing bad reviews, but this type of behavior just isn't right and I felt the need to warn others to be careful."

We had a couple of signature drinks (a bit pricey, but to be expected on the Strip) and ordered the chicken wings, along with the adult tater tots.  The chicken wings were delicious, I love that they are served \"lollipop\" style. This makes them very easy to eat and not messy at all.  I love tater tots of all kinds, but these were outrageously amazing! First of all, they are HUGE and there are chives (I believe) baked into the potato. Once you take a bite, warm cheese fills the center.  They were absolutely the best tater tots I have ever had.  I like the decor of the restaurant, it is covered in all wood paneling, but is way too similar to it's sister property, Fix at Bellagio.  The service is decent, nothing to write home about.  I recommend this place to everyone based off of the tots alone!"

The decor is fabulous consisting of perfect dim lighting with a curvy wood design on the walls. This place makes you feel like you're eating where the big name celebs would eat....it's top notch and fancy.  The service is excellent. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and honest.  Since I am still in search of the best steak in Vegas I chose the Tomahawk rib eye and I had to try the Adult tater tots just for their name. I broke out into laughter when they brought the Tomahawk to the table because there was a foot long bone sticking out of the 18 oz rib eye ( the bone is about 6oz by itself). It was pretty amazing. The steak was melt in your mouth tender with every bite fully marbleized. Portion sizes were designed more for a welterweight than a heavyweight......Sugar Ray not Tyson. Ok...maybe I'm dating myself with that one. So, I left feeling comfortable,not stuffed. I definitely had room for dessert and that's a good thing. Stack is definitely on my radar now and it should be on everyone else's too."

So we spared my aunt and uncle the expense of taking us out to another meal that we probably wouldn't like and went to STACK instead.\n\nSTACK is a pretty strange place.  Not what you'd expect from the typical Vegas steakhouse.  The atmosphere is dark, very dark.  Interior design is modern and warm.  And the music.... oh the music.  Where else can you get a gigantic steak while listening to Prince and the Revolution (yeah, that's right, old school).  STACK is like a dance party waiting to happen, except you likely won't be able to move after you're done eating.\n\nI'm a ribeye fan.  And let me tell you that the cowboy cut here was absolutely perfect.  Not only was it enormous (24 oz), but cooked to perfection.  And seasoned with little more than salt and pepper.\n\nMy sister ordered the kobe burger, and it too was amazing (I couldn't pass up a bite of a burger.... come on).  \n\nBut the single best thing we ate was the 'adult tator tots' stuffed with brie and bacon.  Perfect cylindrical potato morsels that just melt in your mouth.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun menu that doesn't go too over the edge, this is your place.  Unfortunately, like most Vegas restaurants, you can expect to pay for the quality."

Incredible char with a bone that will interfere with those in close proximity. While we expected to pay quite a bit for the meal, we didn't count on a single Margarita being $25. A few things of note: the darkness makes it incredibly difficult to tell if your steak is done to your liking (I prefer medium, and mine was quite rare - thanks phone flashlight for coming to the rescue). Additionally, we wanted a little privacy and got a secluded booth in the back... Until they sat a party of 2 adults and 4 children (under 10) next to us. \n  In any case, it was a great meal. Expect to pay quite a bit (especially if you're drinking or like sides with your meal)."

Too many times cucumber drinks just don't taste right - this one you could really taste the cucumber in it and it didn't taste artificial either.

This place operates similar to a club, where all attention is directed to the cash money millionaires and the wads of paper flowing out of their Prada suits - homeboy at the adjacent table was practically having his feet licked by the wait staff.  Our waiter disappeared after our food was served and a busser served us dessert without spoons which took a good 10 minutes for them to correct, and by that time the ice cream had melted.\n\nSTACK: very trendy place with great food and sucky service."

The cavernous effect does have a downside, however.  Noise. We knew the table 3 rows away was from St. Louis just from being able to hear their convo.  \n\nLets first say that we are not 20somethings living on mommy & daddy's dime and don't go places to be seen which is the vibe we both got from here.  I understand the Light group marketing concept which is have a bunch of hot chicks around and the men with money will show up.  Gotcha.  Makes for great people watching too.  \n\nAnyway, we just wanted to have some tapas like appetizers so we had the bacon/brie adult tater tots -- perfect except we needed 2 orders of them since we were fighting over the 3rd one.  Parm/chicken pops.  melt in the mouth delicious. And the main reason we went, the cooked on the hot rocks thin marinated stacked steaks.  Yum.  \n\nAs our \"main\" course we had grilled cheese and tomato soup.  equally yum.  \n\nSo why only 3 *** if the food was good.  \n\nThe service is terrible.  Even with reservations we had to wait 20 minutes.  There is no separate area for the ongoing bachelorette party of 8 giggle girls at 1 table and 6 at another.  \n\nOnce seated, we became invisible to the point where my dinner companion had to go hunt down someone to take our drink order after waiting at the table another 30 minutes.  If the 4 guys at the table next to us hadn't been so enthralling amusing trying to pick up at least 1 of the girls from table #2 of swingles, you can bet we'd of left.  \n\nThe over all time from arrival to check signing was 1.9 hours.  For simple tapas & soup..way too long.  Even on a holiday weekend.  Coupled with the fact that 3 tables seated after us were gone by the time our main course came, didn't help my mood.  \n\nWe even accounted for the fact that it was a holiday weekend and apparently since the economic downturn, Vegas waitstaff has lost it's ability to hustle.  \n\nWe will try it again if for nothing else the tater tots and hot rock steak alone.

It is kind of like the concept of korean bbq, but a little bit more fancier. That meal costed $21 and was not fulfilling at all, but enough to eat something before a night of drinking and not feeling too full.

We narrowed it down to somewhere in the mirage to help save time and this sounded the best to our husbands. Even upon our first step inside we were plesantly surprised. Very cool vibe and decor. Excellent reception, friendly attentive service from the very get go. The place was totally packed, loud but not annoyingly so. We had a few appetizers and it's been too long to remember all the details but they were all good. I remember nothing was healthy - but whatever we were celelbrating. The steaks were good, sauces yummy and drinks were strong. We had a very lovely evening which was cool because we honestly didn't have high, or even medium expectations for the place. Then a week later we got a hand written thank you note in the mail thanking us for our business. Very nice touch and nice way to bring back a reminder of a fun little weekend trip to vegas. If it was just a few percent cheaper I think it'd be perfect. We'd eaten and MIX the night before which is extremely elegant and amazing and no offense to STACK -but way out of their league and our bills were almost the same. But, that's vegas so we also weren't surprised. If I ever find myself back in the mirage"

Apparently before Eric R. and I got here, our party (his relatives) had to argue with management for 20 minutes to get a round table in the middle of the restaurant (reserved for parties of 6 or more I guess?) - we didn't want a corner tiny table and we needed the round table for the food we got, glad that worked out.\n\nToo many servers...the waiter who took our appetizers was not the one who took entree orders.  Confusing!  We got hot rock with sirloin (barely any meat for the cost, tasty but not worth it), tuna tartare (good), Asian lettuce wraps (these come with pork, beef, and chicken skewers. None of us eat pork.  We asked for a sub.  Waiter says \"We cannot compromise on this - no subs\" - how hard is it to give us chicken skewer instead of pork?  We asked them to leave it off and they wouldn't hahahah)\n\nDrinks - I got a bellini...yummy.  Pellegrino for half table, flat water for other.  Glad I wasn't paying! We asked 2nd waiter for side of onion rings to be an appetizer.  Instead of agreeing and doing so, he goes and looks for first waiter, comes back and tells us we did not order onion rings as appetizer with first waiter...uh duh, we just did with you.  So he asks if we are sure...yes we are...oy!!\n\nEric's relatives ordered the 40 oz steak for 2 and asked for spinach instead of 2nd mashed potatoes...that did not get computed and they got 2 potatoes, 2 spinaches....Eric ordered Brooklyn filet with scampi - asked for it medium, got it rare.  Had to send back but it was better the 2nd time.\n\nI got small shellfish stack - small lobster tail (gave to Eric), big crab legs that came out of shell nicely, 4 oysters, 2 tiger prawns, baby tabasco sauce, mignonette, on ice...pretty good and filling, nice presentation.  We were too full for dessert.\n\nOverall, relatively okay service but a little flighty and bizarre on the ordering, food was okay, atmosphere was too loud and too bachelorette-y, and I don't see a reason to return.  However, the food was tasty enough for 3 stars."

We had three waiters, but some how drinks were not brought to the table until after dinner. When one of the girls told him they no longer wanted the drink because we were leaving dinner he still brought it out and charged us for it. LARGE GROUPS BEWARE they will NOT SPLIT CHECKS, which is a little awkward for the end of dinner when everyone has to pool together to pay. \n\nThe food was alright. Not bad but not great. Two of the girls had to send back their steaks because they were WAY over cooked. It took the entire rest of the meal to get them back (they wanted rare steaks). And like I said for the price you are paying for these steaks they should be done correctly. The veggies were overcooked and not all that enjoyable. The Adult tater tots, mack and cheese, and mashed potatoes were good (they have the carbs down). \nFind another steak house if you want steak, I would even venture to say Ruth's Chris Steak out in Charlotte has better steaks."

We were staying at the Mirage. We are VIP guests at the hotel.  We got to the lobby a bit early so we decided to get a drink at the bar. We asked the bartender if we are allowed to take our drinks to the restaurant and he said yes, for sure. The hostess at the restaurant rudely asked for our drinks .\nWe stepped out of the restaurant to finish the drinks and went back to the hostess desk. She again asked  to have our glasses in a unfriendly approach. I was with my husband and 10 year old son. It took time for the waiter to come to the table. The waiters and bus boys were running back and forth without attending to us for about 10 minutes. The atmosphere made us uptight instead of feeling a relaxed\natmosphere. \nWe asked for bread and the only bread was with ham. We don't eat pork , So we passed. Then I started by ordering the Mac and cheese for my son and that too had ham.  The waiter said that he can whip up some pasta and butter for him. I ordered chicken and my husband ordered an Cesar's salad and a couple of appetizers. my husband asked to speak with the mgr. We explained the situation and experience we are having. He understood and apologized and asked if he can get us some plain bread from the other restaurant, and we said yes. The mgr said he was going to comp my glass of wine, I thanked him. The check arrived,i review'd the charges, they comped the drink and the two appetizers, (which I thought was very nice considering the experience). I saw they charged $33.00 for the pasta. That was suppose to replace the Mac and cheese at $14.00 and I questioned that with the waiter and he snapped at me and said \"we comped your appetizers\". So what that meant is they needed to make it up with an overcharge on the small plate of pasta and butter. I paid cash and will NEVER go back to the place to eat again. We were very disappointed .. \nFYI , it was my sons Birthday and I made everyone aware. The waiter didn't acknowledge him in anyway, which is soo unprofessional. I will spend my money elsewhere where they appreciate the customers."

The staff from bussers to manager changed out all our drinks and cleaned the glass around our table swiftly.  Nice response by all.  We had the pigs in a blanket for an app.  Nothing fancy but just the right size and surprisingly tasty.  The sea bass with lobster risotto and shellfish broth was excellent according to my better half.  I'm not a fish guy but had a taste and it was very good.  I hit up the special which was Bbq spare ribs with potato salad, okra, and corn bread.  Fell completely off the bone.  Excellent smokey flavor.  So good I didn't even want to use any of the extra bbq sauce provided.  But it was quite good in its own right.  Forced ourselves to split a dessert and glad we did.  Had the raspberry donut holes with vanilla sauce.  So good and a nice sweet finish to such a savory meal.

Definitely use the wine sauces provided.  The chicken was on the saltier side, but not too shabby.  Their mint ice cream brownie dessert was delicious and different.  Instead of the artificial mint taste it had more of a mint taste that was similar to Thai basil.  Ambiance was typical for a steakhouse - easy to have a conversation and intimate.  Would definitely try again."

Food has wonderful taste, great service, & nice clean vibes. Calamari is crunchy. Buffalo chicken is okay. Jalapeno king crab tacos taste fresh. Hot rocks are tasty and fun. The stack burger is juicy and filling. Appetizers are very small portions but hey, they're appetizers & fancy places are always small portions. I recommend sharing a couple appetizers. I'll definitely be back! Come thirsty, looking pretty, & you got a nice date!"

Most recently, my date and I had the porterhouse steak for two ($105 for 40oz) which was tender and cooked to perfection, with great flavoring.  The steak for two also came with whipped potatoes, delicious.\n\nWe ordered the jalapeno crab tacos ($24 for four tiny little tacos) to start.  They were alright but I'd probably skip them if I ever dined here again, the meat and potatoes were more than enough food. The signature cocktails are about $20 each, which just sounds ridiculous. I'd skip that too.\n\nThe service was good, though I find the vibe to be douchey and the prices are just a little more than I feel bliss about spending."

Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned.\nThe NY strip was cooked to,perfection (medium rare plus) and was well set off by the herb butter on top.  Spectacular!\nThe grilled asparagus with hollandaise was expertly prepared and was delicious.\n\nFor dessert, even though we were stuffed, we split the jelly doughnut holes.  Again, outstanding.\n\nDid I mention the bread that came with the meal?  Again, awesome.\n\nGreat service, great setting, great food.  The best!"

The Lobster Taco were small, but delicious. I assume the regular appetizer comes with 4 tacos and I highly recommend them. The Skirt Steak was cook nicely at medium rare, and it is quite flavorful, but a little too overpowering by itself. Side orders must be ordered a la carte, and I had my steak with potato wedge French fries. Perhaps something lighter like mashed potatoes would have paired better with the steak. The Jelly Donut Munchkins Holes are super sweet, but too sweet for my liking.\n\nAtmosphere is nice, it's not too dark and not too loud. The servers were great, our food did take awhile to come out (about 45 minutes until the entree came out), but after asking if they could hurry up because we needed to go see a show, they were really helpful in speeding up the process. I would eat here again.\n\nTip: Happy Hour is 7 days a week from 5-7 p.m. with a good selection of appetizers, but you have to eat in the bar/lounge area, not the dinner restaurant area."

Bobby got the fig salad and wasnt as impressed with his. for the next course he got the butter poached lobster rissoto and i got the beef carpachio with salted popcorn... before you make that disgusted scrunchy face hear me out.. sounds odd but it was DELICIOUS!! the crunch and saltyness of the popcorn balanced the raw beef perfectly and i would have eaten 10 of those for my meal and been happy. the risotto was also delicious with huge chunks of lobster on top. we both got the kobe beef for dinner and it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. the menu advertised mashed potatos but we got french fries which were good but we were kind of french- fryd out by the end of the trip\n\noverall it was a delicious meal, service was quick and attentive and the price was reasonable."

The reservationist politely informed me of the dress code (business casual) and that my reservation would be held for a maximum of 15 minutes if I didn't show up (standard.) We showed up at the restaurant fifteen minutes prior and waited a few moments in the lounge area while they set up our table. The seats they gave us were in the back corner, very private and it really set the mood for the evening--it made me feel like an important guest of the restaurant rather than just another Vegas visitor. \n\nI ordered the bone-in ribeye--which was amazing. The portion was huge, but it was so delicious. It came with a choice of two dipping sauces as well, but the steak was juicy enough on its own to where it didn't really need it. My girlfriend and I shared the spicy crab and rice appetizer (amazing--it's kind of like a spicy crab roll but the rice was deep fried-ish.) She also got the seared tuna with ponzu sauce as her entree, which was also very generous in portion.\n\nAll in all, it was a great dining experience and I would definitely go back.

The cantaloupe mojito was tasty, but it fell short on the alcohol content.  I did like the atmosphere (it was warm and relaxing), but overall, if you go with moderate expectations you'll enjoy yourself."

But ah, the food was great. and service went smoothly too. Ambience is dark, sleek, and intimate. So it makes for a pleasant dining experience. The dj is in the back drop playing various types of music. Nothing super loud.\n\nStarted with the the dumplings appetizer. Main course was the 9 oz filet. With a baked potato side. Ended with chocolate lava cake dessert. No bread was offered, as others have stated. But no harm done. \n\nIts a legit restaurant. And I'd come back. I'd recomend a reservation just in case."

However, we stopped in here before going to see Love, and I was pleasantly surprised by Stack. They run a happy hour Monday to Friday from 5-7 with $4 beers, $4 skyy cocktails (NOT including red bull of course), and half price appetizers (bonus star!). Even with half price, the appetizers still run $8-12, but I think they're pretty good. The chili cheese fries are very unique in a \"gourmet\" way, the lobster tacos were great, and I am a sucker for the \"hot rock.\" Pigs in a blanket were pretty standard, as was the shrimp cocktail. The funny thing about the lobster tacos was they are tiny. I don't mean small, like a street-food style taco, I mean tiny like what you would make with a play-do play set as a kid. Or maybe the size of a gummy candy you get in the shape of a taco. Literally, they are each about 1.5\" long. I would have really been pissed if I had to pay the $21 full price for them!\nIt does get pretty noisy in here since it's open to the casino and it has a very bar/lounge-y vibe. Service was good and at 5:30, we were able to walk right in to a bar table without reservations. Again, it's inside a casino on the strip, so you have a varied crowd inside, from bachelorette parties to older couples. \nOverall, the food is good, ambiance is killer, and happy hour prices are awesome. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Stack, but if you ever find yourself inside the Mirage on a week night, go for it."

What has been consistently poor, is the service.  The servers in all three visits were unfriendly and dismissive.  I strongly suspect it is because we had entrees with a couple sides to share, and each a couple of martinis.  The servers want a larger tab.  We also told the young man waiting on us on our last trip, that we were in Vegas celebrating my mom's 60th birthday, to which he shrugged and flatly replied he would bring a birthday dessert.  I, myself, work in fine dining so I was a bit disgusted my his demeanor.  Our bill was $350, sorry that isn't good enough for you, dude.  He was still tipped 20%, though he didn't deserve it with his attitude.  My recommendation is this: Go to Tender Steak & Seafood in the Luxor.  Go elsewhere, Vegas is loaded with plenty of fine dining, high quality steakhouses that don't snub you.  The two stars are for the food.  After the last visit, I will not be back."

The cuts of meat were good, and the sides were nice (the mac and cheese side was great) but I just wanted the guy to know that it seemed a little odd that FOUR of NINE MAINS were wrecked by the chef who doesn't seem to have a real handle on his grill.\n\nI was thinking we'd get one main comped, or SOMETHING, but the bill came and absolutely nothing was done about it. I called over the manager and he offered to buy us a couple glasses of wine - we're settling up, we've got our coats on, that seems a little trite. It kind of pissed me off and I stuck to my guns, said \"we heard great things about this place, your man in the back destroyed 4 meals, there's got to be something you can do\". He finally relented and comped us the lamb and bought us a couple shooters, which I appreciated, but it took a WHOLE LOT of discussion. \n\nI'd give this place a pass if you're in a big group - I don't know how 9 meals at the same time (when 6 of them were steaks!) possible overwhelmed the chef - the place was only half full - but be wary, whomever runs the grill here doesn't seem to fully comprehend its power."

We had stopped by on a Monday night so not busy at all and me and my girlfriend were seated right away. We were told by the waiter that the hot rocks appetizer was a customer favorite, very underwhelmed by the flavor and quality of meat especially for the $21 price tag. Now the entrees and sides were a different story I tried the Brooklyn filet with sides of adult tater tots and spinach everything was above average. The seasoning on the steak was subtle but that's how a great piece of meat should be. The star of the steak was the meat! The adult tater tots were recommended and definitely lived up to the hype spinach was average nothing special. As far as the customer service, it was great our waiter checked in on us every now and again and the ambiance was perfect. One thing I can complain about besides the price tag and taste of the hot rocks was that they charged for every refill of soda which is unheard of for a high end restaurant were our bill was $150+. I mean even McDonald's gives free refills! Would I go out of my way to return definitely not... But as a last minute dinner and if I had some comps for food  perhaps."

The fillet was perfect (more on the smaller side- so you may want to prepare a few sides if your really hungry-lol) the cr\u00e8me Brule was fabulous except it had some weird prune things in between. Everything was very well seasoned and the house sauces were very yummy! The lighting and ambiance was perfect. The disappointing note to our first visit was that it seemed like they were rushing us. Maybe they needed the table(?) The second time, there was a great DJ playing, the food was still good but tried other sides and everything seemed smaller, or just less of a portion we have had anywhere else. Not that we eat A LOT or that we NEED loads of food, but in comparison to surrounding restaurants, everything seemed in smaller quantities. I don't recall any details about the visits in between so they were probably ok. But This last visit... Was pretty awful. We ordered the steak meal for 2, a few sides and a salad. The salad and dressing was extremely bitter-it was like they poured straight vinegar (when we ordered blue cheese) and not to mention we like vinegar lol... but we left it all. Our food took almost an hour and a few minutes to come. Finally the steak came and was pretty much all fat and cartilage. the asparagus were miniscule! and the b\u00e9arnaise sauce was flavorless. The waiter offered to give us dessert for free but we didn't have time or really were in the mood anymore. We were hungry and ended up having Mc'D's after paying approx. $200 for a meal we left behind. I guess its hit or miss! :("

We arrived on time and were escorted to a requested quiet, romantic booth. Our server, Juan introduced himself and said that our co-server, Heidi, would also be assisting. We were given paper menus for the food, which were difficult to read with the dim lighting and our 50+ eyes, and tablet with the drink menu, which was interesting. We ordered martinis (very pricey) and asked for a sample of an \"unfiltered\" Belvedere Vodka, which Juan was happy to accommodate. We ordered a simple Caesar Salad (all salads serve 2 - thus the seemingly outrageous price), I had the King Crab Cocktail and hubby had the Swordfish Steak. The food was delicious and was well prepared and seasoned! The only complaint is that halfway through the meal Heidi showed up and introduced herself and that was the only time we saw her. We had already told Juan that we were going to the show and hoped that he would time everything appropriately. Evidently, he didn't communicate that to Heidi and there a scramble at the end to get the check and pay in order to make the show. All in all, we would return and would love to try some of the other selections on the menu."

Said they were running late when we arrived and continued to seat other groups that probably didnt even have reservations in front of our group.\n\nWaiter was weird.  Think he was on something.\n\nFood took FOREVER to come out.\n\nOur side dishes were good but our Tomahawk Rib-Eye looked like it was sliced with a butter knife.  Asked for medium rare and it was pretty damn rare.   \n\nAll in all, this place is OK but there are just too many restaurants to choose from on the strip (or even within The Mirage) that are much much better.\n\nI think this restaurant is owned or managed by the same company as Fix at the Bellagio.  The menu and decor are very similar.  We really enjoyed our dinner at Fix on our last trip to Vegas.  Go there."

We waited a few minutes for our reservations and eventually were seated at a long table. We did have 2 split tables so about 10 at each one (the benefit of this was when the bill came).\n\nEverything on the menu looked good, but I knew I wanted to the crab and Jalapeno tacos. My friend and I decided to share 2 appetizers and a salad.\n\nSo, about 10-15 minutes later one of our appetizers arrives! We look around our table and make sure it's ours and then start devouring it. About another 15 minutes later our 2nd appetizer arrives (which should be the tacos), but our appetizer is definitely not tacos.\n\nWe tell the waiter that we should have recieved the tacos and he insists that we are the ones that are incorrect (how dare we accuse him for bringing the wrong appetizer). He says we probably ate the wrong 1st appetizer. He leaves for a few minutes and then says, yea you ate his food and he ate yours. Hmmm that's werid, because you guys put that food in front of US and not our friend who is 2-3 seats down. Both of the appetizers that we ordered had tuna, so had no idea we were eating the wrong appetizer. \n\nThe only attempt at rectifying the situation was, \"so would you like me to order you something else\", no I'd rather not spend another $19 on appetizer that I should have been given, thanks anyway.\n\nWhat was even more crushing was the tacos were the one thing on the menu I was looking forward to eating. :(\n\nAnyway, despite the horrible server, I thought the food was good. We got the garbage salad and the portion was good enough the share and I thought it was delicious. Both of our tuna appetizers were also tasty, and I snuck half of a friends Tater tots and liked those!\n\nOh make sure you order the popovers! And hopefully you get seated in a different area as we did...and if you didn't know this dining rule now you do: It is your responsibility to make sure you are eating the correct appetizer."

The two restaurants are similar in food and style - trendy American best describes it.\n\nLike FIX, the menu concentrates on trendy or inventive variations of standard American fare. A specialty is Hot Rocks: thinly sliced raw sirloin, cooked table side on a hot rock. You can also get Kobe chili cheese dogs, or a more traditional steak or lobster.\n\nThe atmosphere? It's noisy, dark, with candles and spot lights on tables, plus a few accent lights. Servers were dressed a little more conservatively than at FIX. Otherwise, they were similar: young, all in black.\n\nI had a Kobe burger, which comes with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and an onion ring, all on a bun. Tall is the theme at this place. It was decent. Fries are served on the side. I also tried the adult tater tots, which include mild brie and bacon flavors. Also decent.\n\nBased on one meal, I'd say you shouldn't come here for the food, but if you're here already, the food is better than you might expect at a trendy bar. It isn't as good as FIX, but it also isn't as expensive."

Once we were seated, the service was incredibly (unforgivably) slow. We ordered 3 course prix fixe meals, and there was still 45 minutes between when we finished our appetizer and when we received our entree. The entire dining experience took over 3 hours. We complained about the long wait, and they offered to knock the wine (a cheap bottle) off the bill. If you ask me, though, an extra hour or two of prime time in Vegas (10pm-ish) during vacation is worth more than $40 bottle of wine. \n\nThe only reason this place gets two stars as opposed to one is that I went there more recently for the happy hour, and the service was better. Then again, it was empty during the Monday happy hour, maybe that's why it was so quick."

We were thrilled to find one of our favorite wines by the glass, and their entire list and drink menu were great. Thanks to suggestions mentioned by previous reviews we ordered all the right things. Started with the caeser salad that our server split for us. My husband always says he can judge a restaurant by its caeser salad. He was not disappointed. We had to give the Hot Rock a try and it was not only fun but so delicous. We followed that with the Spicy Crab which wasnt too spicy. I found it a little salty but he didnt think so. The highlight was the Miso Black Cod lettuce cups. I still can't stop thinking about them. I have to find the recipe to the sauce so I can duplicate this at home. This is a must try! We then got the adult tator tots which have brie and bacon in them. They were like fried potato skins only better. We also had the kobe beef chili cheese fries. So amazing I could eat an entire bowl. We ended with the jelly donut holes that you dip into a cream anglaise sauce. The perfect finish. We left stuffed and satisifed. Our server Vince was superb, a polished professional that attended to our needs but did not hover. I would most definitely return and recommend to family and friends."

STACK's solution to that challenge is to hire the most beautiful hostesses and bartenders in the city (really, these young women are gorgeous) and then not train for a single hour in their jobs. Me and my friend went here for a late-ish dinner after seeing LOVE at the Mirage on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was far from full. It has a very modern, minimalist, dimly lighted decor reminiscent of several of Vegas's new line of \"chic\" steak joins such as BOA and N9NE. The problem was that it took the hostesses almost 20 minutes to find us a table, a problem that was compounded when they didn't know how to transfer our drinks from the bar to the restaurant bill. Also the drinks here are overpriced, even by Vegas standards ($18-19 each) and the bartenders, albeit friendly and pretty, are far from noted mixologists. My friend's martini was made so sweet that it was undrinkable while mine was just flat and supremely forgettable. The best part of the menu are the appetizers; the Pigs in a Blanket are a fun dish not often found in similar venues and I enjoyed the adult tater odds. Me and my friend split the Chateubrand steak for 2 with whipped potatoes on the side and thought that it was a nice cut of meat but not in the same class as Delmenico's, PRIME, CUT, or the dearly departed Nero's. Yet you will be well fed and probably too full to try out desert. The restaurant seems to have a prix-fixe that goes for around 50-60 which I've heard good things about but the restaurant does a bad job advertising it.\n\n Finally, STACK wins the award for most unnecessary bathroom attendant on the Strip. A bathroom as clausterophic and cramped as STACK's is no place for a man in a tux to stand behind the door (and essentially sneak up on you when you try to wash your hands)."

Service was good.\n\nThe fact that I'm in the wine business leads to this bitch: no burgundy glasses.  That's right, an upscale place that doesn't have the correct glassware for Pinot Noir.  Just a giant frickin minus right there.  Even a mid tier restaurant in Seattle has got that covered.  The sommelier was apologetic, as she apparently has been banging the drum to the manager to get some ordered.  I might have to drop an email......"

We got  the crispy fires and the adult tater tots as sides with the molten chocolate cake as desert. \n\nThe steaks were delicious and I don't think anyone could ever mess up fresh lobster. \n\nThe sides were inventive and tasty.  I enjoyed my tater tots with white truffle sauce meant for the fries.  The sides accompanied our meals very well and the food came out in a refreshing amount of time.  \n\nThe ambiance and music selections brought a smile to our faces and the wait staff was always beaming whenever we encountered them.\n\nI would like to try their dinner for two if I find myself back in the Mirage again."

Their steaks are all so tender that there's really no need to even order the Filet, you can order any of the cuts and get more flavor and the same tenderness.  \n\nThe decor is steakhouse-ish, with it's low lights and dark tones, but the crowd is lively, they have an excellent bar, and the music keeps things pumping.  It's also got one wall open to the casino that allows the crowd outside to add to the vibe.\n\nThe appetizers give you some balance to all that protein and you won't find a better appetizer in any restaurant than their Crunchy Tuna Tacos.  \n\nIf you want some post-Stack entertainment, you can always go to the side bar near registration and hang out with the hookers.  Great steaks and free entertainment!"

            "review": "Ugh, what a disappointment. We researched Yelp, read tons of reviews an ultimately chose Stack over the other two places in Mirage. What a mistake. \n\nThe atmosphere was great, a neat place with an intricate design of woods and mood lighting make up the walls and ceiling. Very beautiful. Menu was good, good selection. Drink menu was via an iPad app. I have an iPad and love Apple but I just think this is stupid. Just give me a regular menu. The drinks were very good looking, but SUPER pricey. Specialty cocktails were around $18-$20. Mojito was $19... What a joke. Wine by the glass was $20 and up. I mean seriously, does it need to be that much? We had two beers, both were $8, still expensive but we got two drinks for under $20 (what a bargain). \n\nWe shared the kale salad, bacon and brie tater tots and ahi tartare. First off, the kale salad didn't list red onions as an ingredient and it came with them all over. Had to send it back. Once fixed, the salad was super salty but pretty tasty and very filling. Bacon and brie tater tots were good as well, but expensive for what small amount you got. The Ahi Tartare... Oh I wish this was better. It was served marinated, cut chunk style in a bowl on top of avocado. On the side were what they called shrimp chips. Like round puffed air scoops that smelled and tasted fishy. The ahi was fishy. I order this dish all the time everywhere- including the Cheesecake Factory (where its excellent) and here it was terrible. From the amount, to the texture, to the taste, just awful. \n\nIm sure if we ordered the $170 surf and turf (lobster and steak) we would have loved it. We spent near $80 and it was sick. I felt like this was just a status restaurant, take someone here to impress them with the prices. Go elsewhere to eat tasty food that might not set your mortgage to shame."

We went to Beatles Love earlier in the night and decided to hit Stack at 10 before we continued on for the evening.  The vibe in this place was one of the best I have experienced in LV.  It's nothing over the top, just really cool design and fun.  You can tell when you get there, that this place is going to serve good booze and good food.  My wife and I split 3 small plates (Lobster Tacos, Spicy Hamachi, Lamb Sliders) and the waiter through in some Adult tater tots.  Each of the plates was amazing.  We felt the server at this restaurant did such a better job than our guy the night before.  The food is not as high end as some of the places on the strip, but for 1/3 of the cost, my wife and I had just as good of a time.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone stopping by the Mirage!!"

The buffalo wings were tender and fell right off the bone. Crab tacos were also amazing. The server was very well-informed about food allergies and told me which ones were safe and unsafe. The only complaint I had was taking my food home. The fridge in our room was so small, a box would not fit. I asked for a piece of foil to wrap my meat in and they told me there was no foil in the kitchen (yeah right) but they would bring me something else. 15 minutes later, I asked a second waiter if I could get foil for my meat. 15 minutes later I had to ask the manager, and he IMMEDIATELY returned with foil for me.

            "review": "I stay at the Mirage about twice year and have done so for about 4 years now.  You think in all that time I'd have tried STACK a few times.  Nope.  Let me explain why.\n\nIf like me you frequent the Mirage, there are two perimeter choices that make more sense.  KOKOMOS is also a steak house, but with a nicer setting and ambiance.  KOKs is in the casino by the waterfalls and flora, which makes it feel 'outside' somehow, whereas STACK is one of the 'holes' in the resort's restaurant row.  So why pay through the eyeballs for steak at STACK where KOK's offers the same in a nicer spot?  Not that rolling wooden interior of STACK isn't pretty, but it could use windows above or on the sides or both to the real world.  Also, if you just want a beef fix, BLT BURGER offers burgers in a more informal open air location by the RHUMBAR and is FAR less expensive.\n\nThis all sounds so critical, and yet you plainly see five stars.  Please be patient.  Give me time to explain my partner in crime is vegetarian and we needed quick eats.  So spying the menu we saw a tomato soup, a tuna tartar, and other quick munchies.  Were they quick?  Yes, but that's because we asked for speed and we were oh so early.  Were they inexpensive or even reasonable?  Umm... no.. but let me explain.\n\nFirstly, we ate in the bar area.  Our wait persons were lovely ladies.  They even bussed.  Think about that for a moment.  Models in those Vegas Baby short skirts... bussing the table.  Didn't expect that, right?  And they weren't sleazy party babes but classy young women.  This had an impact on the meal, since we were feeling... spoiled.\n\nOut comes this silly tomato soup and an extra bowl.  In that bowl is a butter (homemade?) and perhaps some seasoning (?).  The soup is poured in from a tiny metal pot the size of a coffee mug,  We stir, we swirl, we taste.  Ambrosia.  Perfect temperature to work slowly on but in minutes no hesitation was needed.  \n\nBeside these soups were two of the smallest grilled cheese fingerfood sandwiches ever.  Even the bread crust was removed.  And so you feel angry you must ration out bites between your sips of soup.  But it turns you don't have to.  The cheese is goat cheese and each bite is so rich it's like a slice of cheesecake.  Heaven. \n\nMy tuna tartar seemed small but was so flavorfu; that it and the soup filled me.  (That's a healthy 'meal' for $30.)   My partner had a blue cheese wedge.  Not a merciless stiff chunk of iceberg but a butter lettuce bouguet anointed with cheese and nuts that was so beautiful we took a picture of it.  Really.\n\nWhat we realized just between three plates it that we've missed a fabulous restaurant hiding right before our eyes for years.  I've never seen a soul in the nearby Chinese restaurant, the Ondo is a pass , Kokomos should be a Houstons, and so it's TOO EASY to ignore STACK.  Don't.\n\nDon't ignore STACK.  We WILL return for an actual meal, even if that means eating in the dim but elegant dungeon within.  It's a romantic looking spot but I get a little claustraphobie without windows.\n\nTWO MAJOR CRITICISMS:  this place should either be open for lunch or willing to deliver affordable eats right to the pool.  Also:  no beer on tap?  Are you kidding?  That's what falls out of the back of a bull.  Make a deal with New Belgium beers and only serve their amazing brews.  Please."

As I walked up the warm wood curved ramp to the maitre d, I noticed the similar treatment that was done on the walls and ceilings. A warm and inviting yet mature setting that is elevated but not too serious. Even in the presentation of the food, they used mini cast iron casserole dishes for their side dishes and appetizers. Service was perfectly timed and excellently professional.\n\nAppetizers: Lobster Fries w/ truffle sauce, Pigs in a Blanket, Lobster Tacos w/ lime cream sauce\nEntree: Seabass w/ Lobster Risotto\nSides: Truffle Fries, Adult Tater Tots, Sauteed Spinach\nDessert: Sugar coated raspberry donut holes with vanilla bean sauce\n\nEverything we ordered was AMAZING. There wasn't anything that we ordered that tasted badly and I highly recommend everything I've listed in our list of ordered food. The main star of the evening though was the Sea Bass. I have never tasted such a perfectly cooked piece of great quality fish in my life. Paired with the lobster risotto (which was heavy on the lobster.... not a bad thing), the dish was definitely devoured in whole. The perfect way to end such a great meal thus far was when we ordered the raspberry jelly filled donut holes. They were warm, slightly crispy on the outside, but oh so good. They were like the fattier American style of French Beignets.\n\nBottom-line: Amazing, amazing, amazing, and impressive food that surprised me and my taste buds of American classics."

I highly recommend the yellowtail appetizer and the petite filet was cooked to perfection.\n\nTheir menu has something for everyone, even those with dietary restrictions. I told the waiter that I needed gluten & dairy free options and he actually took the time to go thru the menu and point out everything that naturally fit my requirements or could be adjusted to.  He even went through all the sauces I needed to avoid and which menu items they came on.

He even brought over a very nice bottle of champagne (not sparkling wine) for the birthday girl.\n\nThis was, without question, one of the best dining experiences I have had in Vegas.

However, there's literally a cut of butter on top of the steak so maybe that's what that reference is for. It's a fatty steak so you'll cut a bit off but thats common for this cut. We also had the kale salad and the seabass, both of which were also really delish. We had no problems with wait time as some others mentioned. We told our server ahead of time we were going to the Boyz II Men concert in the casino and they brought the food out surprisingly fast. It's not cheap but most good things in Vegas are not.

Melt in your mouth beef with a pat of herbed butter and two sauces: green peppercorn demi and a red wine reduction were a perfect match! I got the brie tater tots, but they were a bit on the rubbery side. I'd have preferred a crunchier texture, but the taste was very good. I also had the hamachi sashimi app, but that's not really worth talking about, tasted good, but very boring. I'd cut it from the menu if it were my place. It just doesn't match the rest of the menu very well and you can get a much better taste of hamachi at a sushi restaurant."

The waitresses,  while attractive, fell very short when asked questions about the menu and wine list. They also seemed to lack communication with the kitchen staff as there was general confusion about when our orders were going to be coming out. I would come back with a crew of buddies to dine before we roll out to the clubs."

So we ordered our two drinks from the bartender which she gave us about half her attention because she could not repeat back both our orders. She listened to the second order and said ok so two vodka martinis ...no..... then when she came back to deliver the drinks she flashed attitude.  Then she wanted to hold our credit card while we kept the tab open.  Should I continue??  This is not the service level I would expect from The Mirage. Then a few male cowboys arrived and the bartender made a bee line for these guys to hang all over them.  Not exactly what I would expect  from this caliber of hotel.  Oh and did I mention 2 drinks were $38?  Are you kidding me???\n\nNow the food was delicious! We had a few appetizers and enjoyed everything.  So maybe just get a table and give them a try but don't be shy.. this place is far from. Fair on their pricing.  \n\nNow all that being said the hostesses were so kind and helpful and super sweet!

The wings were cooked perfect with the right amount of heat and the blue cheese sauce was perfect.  My sweets isn't a fan of blue cheese and he still loved it.  We ordered the ultimate surf and turf which was a 2lb stuffed Maine lobster, a 40oz Porterhouse and two sides. Both the steak and lobster did not disappoint. They were both cooked perfect and the presentation was nice. Everything was pre sliced so it made it easy to dive right in and enjoy.  We ordered the country potato gratin and the baby vegetables and they were both delish.  I think this will be our new go to steakhouse while in Vegas just turn down the horrible club music and play a little ambient already hahahaha!"

The lamb gyros were good and we had the burger for a main course. The burger was outstanding - but $34? Daniel Boulud has a $35 burger in NYC that is stuffed with Fois Gras - this was just a burger. Ambiance is awesome. Overall it is glorified, expensive bar food in a nice setting."

Then, there are others that were once good, but those days have come and gone. I'm sad to say this happened with Stack at Mirage. Eight years ago it opened with Brian Massie at the helm. The space was beautiful, service was exceptional and the food was everything good ole American comfort food should be, and the playful twists made it fun. Over the years, we've dined at Stack more than any other fine dining restaurant. We loved the relaxed vibe, the stacked waitresses and the classic tunes. The hot rocks, pork chop and lamb shank were outstanding. The bacon cheddar bread? Oh my goodness, we couldn't get enough. We'd return for that alone. \n\nOver time, they no longer offered the bread. The classic rock was replaced by club beats and the prices climbed while quality sank. We noticed a decline about a year ago, and it was confirmed a few months back when we took my husband's cousin out for her birthday. My brother joined us, too, he was eager to try the lamb shank he's heard so much about. I even called beforehand to confirm it was still be served. You can imagine our disappointment when we couldn't locate it on the menu. We waived down our waiter and sure enough, it's been eliminated. This was likely the sign to leave, but we ignored it. We've always been pleased with the steak selection and everyone but me opted to go that route. I chose the halibut ($42). \n\nWe started with hot rocks ($21) they were still excellent. The Spicy Crab ($21) was a new item and it didn't pack any punch. It left us pretty underwhelmed. \n\nWe've enjoyed the porterhouse for two at Brand. We expected the same quality here at Stack but it fell a bit flat ($96). It was plenty for two to share, but it wasn't as flavorful or tender as we know it could be. We also shared tater tots ($11) and roasted mushrooms ($9). The tots used to have pieces of rich smoky bacon and cheese would ooze when you'd bite into eat tot. That's not the case anymore. \n\nThis was my brother's first fine dining experience. he went all out and ordered the porterhouse ($62). I wish I could say he was able to reap the perks and find the value of a quality piece of meat. It was very average at best. He was disappointed and I was bummed for him.\n\nMy halibut was the best dish of the evening, the exception being the hot rocks. The halibut was nicely prepared with a hard sear and it was very fresh.\n\nAfter finishing that meal, the warm comforting mahogany walls suddenly felt somber. A longtime favorite had faded. We knew we wouldn't be back. We suspect it would soon shutter. I didn't see it surviving long after the opening of Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak. I haven't heard any news of it closing, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised if it did."

The music is loud, so it's a good place for amping up for your night out.  The ambiance is a bit frenetic if you're looking for a romantic spot.\n\nThis is a good place for small plates and sharing.  \n\nThings to order:  hot rocks (order the hot rocks!), shellfish tier (awesome sauces), steak fries, cucumber martini.  They used to have AWESOME kobe beef chili cheese fries but they took that off the menu.  Boo!  \n\nThis is always a safe bet.  Sometimes, that's exactly what you need in Vegas."

Along with the stunning d\u00e9cor, service and food was top-notch. \n\nOur server, Kyle, effused an easy-going friendliness yet attentive professionalism throughout the evening. We perused the cocktail and wine list as Kyle suggested several beverage recommendations. Upon checking in on Yelp, we accepted the FREE offer for a House Shot then ordered a couple of Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPAs. We each received a House Shot of raspberry vodka.  \n\nMeanwhile, we were deciding on our dinner selections and chose to split our meals because we were still sort of full from our lunch. Kyle accommodated us by having the kitchen split our fresh made Caesar salad and 24 oz. Tomahawk ribeye steak. He also recommended the Adult Tater Tots which were deep fried GB&D and stuffed with bacon and Brie cheese.  The Caesar salad was refreshing and the croutons, which I don't normally eat, were light and toasted crisp. The ribeye steak was AMAZING...tender, juicy, grilled-to-perfection and flavorful. It was huge and we were glad to share it between ourselves. Our Adult Tater Tots were large marshmallow sized hash brown \"plugs\". It's exterior was crisp fried golden brown while its interior was a bacon and Brie stuffed potato.  We were content and satiated from our fine steak when Kyle presented us with the Dessert Menu. Oh, our knees went weak when we noticed their Signature Mint Chocolate Bonbons served with Bailey's Irish Cream dip. Those \"bites\" into the bonbons were scrumptious and a chocolate-mint lover's dream!\n\nOnce in a while, we get cravings for beef.

Trendy appetizers? Yes, but Stack is one of the few places that offers all of these things on one menu, and it is all CONSISTENTLY good.  The bottom line: I've never had anything less than an exception meal from the 6 or 7 meals I've had at Stack. The menu is always being tweaked and added to, and seasonal, price-fixed, and event based menus are commonly available (such as for the rodeo), and can be very enticing if you catch a special menu that interests you.  \n\nAll of the food I've had here is great and would recommend everything I've had.  The appetizers are wonderful, specificially the hibachi lettuce cups, the steaks are simple but executed perfectly, and the desserts are light and a perfect way to end the meal (I would suggest the mini donut holes).  \n\nThe service is not the best here, but it always good - my only complains would be that 1) even with a reservation, I typically find myself waiting in the bar for up to 20 minutes waiting on a table, and 2) this place gets LOUD during peak hours on Friday and Saturday nights.  If you are looking for a nice, quiet, intimate meal with a lot of conversation, you might want to look elsewhere."

Stack was one of those overpriced, trendy joints that you can find throughout hot spot cities.\n\nWithout reservations at 10pm, we were subjected to a 20-minute wait, which allowed us some time at the tables.  Of course, we waited a little more when we returned and by that time I was starving.  When they seated us, there were no complimentary bread baskets.  Negative points.\n\nI didn't want to spend a lot of money on the entrees so I got a roasted tomato soup and pigs in a blanket.  The soup came with a side of mini grilled cheese sandwiches, which, I'm sad to report, were the best parts of my meal.  The cheese was mild and the crust was taken off, which was fine by me.  I wish they used a different cheese though.  The soup itself was very acidic and a much bigger portion than I had expected.  The pigs in a blanket were 11 small bites served in a bowl with ketchup and mustard on the side.  They were extremely salty and I could have very easily done without this dish.\n\nI don't mind spending two hours or more for dinner -- if it were some Michelin-star restaurant, which definitely wasn't the case at Stack.  Our waitress was insufferably slow and didn't seem too concerned about our table.   Take your money elsewhere."

            "review": "Nice atmosphere and the waitstaff were pleasant and timely. We ordered the hot rocks which is kinda fun but pretty much an overpriced gimic - you get maybe an ounce of meat for $18. For entrees we both ordered the tomahawk ribeye and two sides to share.  They brought one of the wrong sides.  The steaks were ordered medium rare minus and medium well - both were a flat medium. So they cleared the table and brought everything fresh. Apparently the chef didn't like criticism because the steaks were now very rare and very well done. For the price ($200+ for a couple), there is far, far better. Can't say we'd return or recommend it to others.\n\nUPDATE:\nSecond time around was a much better experience. We had mini lamb gyros and crunch shrimp calabrian for appetizers. The \"gyros\" were like mini Greek tacos and were delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the shrimp but hubby liked it. We tried a special salad they had that night. It was pretty good. The description included maple glazed bacon but it was more like pieces of pork belly, which I'm not a fan of but overall the salad was decent. We both had tomahawk ribeyes and this time they were perfectly cooked. The atmosphere is modern and lively. Overall an enjoyable dinner experience."

For checking in, they gave a free shot that was perfect because it was her birthday. We shared the Hot Rocks appetizer, which is NY cut thinly sliced that you cook (interactive) on hot stones (600 degrees). \nThe place is known for their steaks and Tater tot side dish, but we decided to go the seafood route. She had Sea Bass with Lobster risotto and I had Seafood Risotto. The fish was fabulous...fresh and flaky. Both risottos were on point - rich, creamy with fresh pieces of lobster in both, and mind had shrimp and calamari as well. Must have the Brussel sprouts - crispy, sweet and salty with balsamic and walnuts...the best I've ever had. I could've easily just eaten those all night. Drinks at the bar were pretty pricey - but it's Vegas. Music was going but not too loud to have conversations. Prices were moderate and it was Definitely a lively place. highly recommend for couples or groups."

We were going to have a low-key (read: inexpensive) dinner at The Pantry (24-hour restaurant at Mirage), but upon being seated, we decided the atmosphere just wasn't for us (too clangy-noisy, unappetizing menu, low-end ambience, etc.). \n\nInstead we went to Stack which is an upscale restaurant with a beautiful, wavy sculpted wood interior, and a dimly lit and warm atmosphere. Although the music was a bit too loud (they should reduce the volume when the restaurant has fewer patrons to absorb the sound), the sound quality was good where it doesn't wear on you. \n\nOur server Zach personified the definition of hospitality. He is super friendly, accommodating, professional and one of those servers who actually enhances your dining experience! We welcomed that after having inhospitable servers at Otto and Mon Ami Gabi who should have been relegated to the back kitchen. Zach advised us on entree and wine selections, was attentive throughout the evening and made our dinner relaxed and fun! \n\nThis restaurant isn't for you if you're on a budget (wines by the bottle start around $135 and go way up from there), but if you can splurge a little, the food and service are excellent!"

The entire evening was planned 3-4 weeks in advance. Lots of coordinating since I was paying for the evening, yet not attending. (Sorry to digress, but one cannot pay ahead of time through a credit card verification for Stack.) The reservation was made through the 800 number on website dedicated to reservations for dinner and/or shows. I received confirmation numbers. 9 guests arrive and guess what? NO RESERVATIONS. The manager tried to accommodate and did eventually seat the party in the bar. Meal was very good. (this is not a food review) but very rushed due to Show Time. A good restaurant is not always about the food! It is about organization, customer service and so forth. Lots of apologizing upon return but not much else. Probably a glitch I was told. Will never go back. Lesson learned- never book through 800 number designated for reservations!  Sort of laughable since booking reservations is their job!  Don't take a gamble. (Pun intended)"

We both love steak and were staying at the Mirage, which made getting dressed up to go out very easy!\n\nWe knew it would be pricey, but I know for the perfect steak it is worth the price.  For every steakhouse I base my review on the cut of steak they started with, and how it is cooked.  Some places start out with a bad cut of meat and still cook it right, and other places have a beautiful slab of meat that they absolutely destroy.  And depending on the repuation of a place, I will order the rareness of my steak differently.  \n\nWhen we had dinner at Stack, I took the risk and ordered my ribeye steak medium.  It was called the Tomahawk steak with the bone in. When it came to the table, I was floored... it was a beautiful thick-cut ribeye still attached to the full bone, which extended impressively off the plate about 12\" or more!  The presentation alone was magnificent.  And then the taste was spot on... they used a type of herbed butter, but it did not take away from the taste at all.  It was a perfect medium, not too rare and not overcooked.  It is places like this that make me want a steak dinner every day! \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the fillet... and it was perfectly tender.... almost like butter! I am so glad he shared a bite with me.\n\nWe also shared the asparagus with truffle hollandaise which complemented the steak perfectly.\n\nTo finish it all off, we had the creme brulee with cherries... it was fantastic! Again, the presentation was so fanciful, as it came in a thin swirly dish in the shape of a slender \"S.\"  \n\nThey have a decent wine menu and are a must-go steakhouse for whenever we return to Vegas!"

We watched as the manager, and 3 hostesses and a bunch of waiters just stood there- and we were waiting.

A few minutes later we were seated and we knew right away this was trouble.\nThe waiter was awful, awful attitude and not the least bit attentive.\nAny request we had he acted as if we were bothering him - rarely came by - and didnt come back to fill drinks unless we flagged him down.\nThis really wasnt good- because the food is GREAT - just the service is awful.  I would order everything at once - and pray.\n\nWe had lobster tacos, sashimi, nyc sirloin and drinks.

They also had a huge vaulted ceiling which made the main dining area unlike anything I've seen.\n\nThe family started with the hot rock steak, which the girls thought was very neat and delicious - and it was, BOTH.  The meat was awesome, I wish we had more, but their appetizers are designed to leave you wanting more.  We also liked the pigs in a blanket, which had a perfectly crisp and flaky blanket..  My favorite appetizer was the poke tacos, unfortunately each taco is one bite.  For entrees, we had the sea bass which was perfect, and I mean PERFECT, and the 9 oz. Petite Filet Bone-Out, also cooked to perfection at medium rare.  My girls split the most expensive hamburger ever, the Kobe Beef Burger @ $30, BUT... it was one tasty burger!  A side worth mentioning is the Baked Mac 'N Cheese, which the kids devoured.  We figured we might as well go all in, so, for dessert we had the perfect bites of jelly donuts, which was good, but not amazing, like everything else.  \n\nAs for drinks, my wife LOVED the Berrylicious martini, just make sure you like sweet things.

Best of all, if you use Yelp to check in, you get two free shots, which we quite enjoyed, it was something strong and sweet.\n\nI can't wait to go back - without kids."

Genius! It came with a lemon slice and a little Tabasco sauce. I ordered the salmon for my entree and unfortunately, I had it sent back to the kitchen. I've never done this type of thing because I feel so terrible asking them to redo anything over! I usually just suck it up and eat it. However, I was not informed that the salmon would be more raw in the middle. I thought they would cook it all the way through, so I was so surprised when I got towards the center. I asked the server and he said, yep, that's how the salmon works, medium rare. He didn't tell me that before. He did bring it back without any problems though. They even gave me a whole new piece of salmon! I felt so bad, but I didn't want to eat raw salmon. It was definitely delicious after though. Mac and cheese was standard, in my opinion. There wasn't anything particularly outstanding about it. I had the banana lemon dessert after with a scoop of chocolate ice cream. It was so good! The dessert was tangy and sweet and the ice cream was super chocolatey.

We made a reservation for 6pm and were seated immediately. We ordered the Caesar salad to start and had them split it in half... We ended up ordering the chicken with green beans and a side of mashed potatoes. Omg the glaze on the chicken is to die for and the mashed potatoes are so buttery and good. Our server Logan was awesome she was a very friendly girl and made us feel very important. I will deff be back thank you stack for an awesome experience!"

We went with my husbands boss and a coworker of his while in town for a conference. \n\nThe food was great and the hostess and service staff we're friendly.  For the appetizers we ordered the hot rocks where you cook thin steaks on it.  Very cool. We also ordered the buffalo chicken wings, which had the right amount of kick and they were very easy to eat with only one bone sticking out.  The perfect sophisticated buffalo wings. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with kale, and they were amazing.  The others at the table ordered steaks and were satisfied.  You do order your sides separate.  We had two orders of adult tater tots at the table and they were a big hit! \n\nThe drinks were great too.\nI would highly recommend this place"

We got an awesome deal for 4 with pre-fix menu at Stack, when we bought tickets to see the show \"Love.\"  I ordered the lobster tacos, steak, and mint chocolate ice cream sandwich.  The lobster tacos were good, but really really small, the steak was awesome and they paired it with some reduction that was sooo good we couldn't stop pouring it.  The desserts were the perfect ending- the mint chocolate ice cream went so well with the meal and was not too sweet.  It was very refreshing.  I didn't have the jell donuts but everyone else at the table did, and had raving reviews.  They said it was the best part.  I would definitely recommend the restuarant.  The service is friendly, but they are really slow at delivering the food.  I think we waited over 30 minutes for the appetizer...granted it was New Year's weekend so maybe they were just really busy?"

The 3 star rating is based purely on the food. \n\nWhen we were seated, it took the server a bit of time to greet us. When she approached the table, she seemed a lilttle overwhelmed. There was a quick introduction of herself and her partner. We ordered drinks and they took a while to get to us - our friends weren't drinking and only got soda and that seemed to take a while as well. Once we ordered our apps and meals, we didn't see the server for a while. We wanted another round of drinks, but since we never saw her, we weren't able to order a second round. She didn't even deliver our entrees, it was her partner along which another gentlemen. When my boyfriend received his steak, he commented on how large it was. Her partner (I wish I remembered his name) stated people usually don't expect it to be as big as it is. A few minutes later, the server approached the tabled and asked my boyfriend if he wanted the steak for a single or 2 people. Before he could answer, she stated she forgot to ask. I found this a bit odd. My boyfriend said he ordered the dry-rubbed steak and she immediately knew it was for a single, but it wasn't what she entered as the order. She simply shrugged her shoulders and walked away. \n\nWhen we received our check, we were charged for the steak for 2.  My boyfriend didn't want to make a big deal about it, so he went ahead and just paid the bill.  As her partner came to run our card, my friend was going to say something, but ended up stopping mid-sentence. Her partner, noticed there was some awkwardness and stated he knew what we were debating about and said he would fix it. He clearly read our cues and responded quickly. He ended up bringing the check back without charging us for my boyfriends steak on it and apologized for the inconvenience and mistake that took place. We thought it was a bit much, but he insisted. We were floored by his customer service for a mistake he didn't cause. As I was signing the check, the female server came back and said she was going to fix the check. When I stated her partner had already taken the initiative to fix the check, she stated that he didn't know what he was doing  and didn't know what was going on. She removed the check presenter and went back to charge us for the steak. Basically - threw her partner under the bus. \n\nLet me make it clear, we didn't care to have to pay for the steak, but the customer service aspect of this server was frustrating. Her partner was wonderful, but she just seemed to busy and overwhelmed the hostess should have probably stopped seating her. We still tipped 20%, but only to ensure her partner would get his fair cut. After the initial mistake, she never once apologized nor seemed to care that she made a mistake and failed to provide great service."

It could had been because I was full but it was good if you're not full.\n\nLobster - husband got the lobster and that was good. It wasn't spectacular but it was good. It better be for $80.\n\nChicken Wings - my husband loves chicken wings, so we got this... and it was good. Very small - which was expected but really good.\n\nAdult Tater Tots - meh\n\nSERVICE:\nVery high end fancy so it was good. Standard.\n\nOVERALL: \nIt was a good experience.

He had great recommendations. He was so sweet he even gave us a round of pineapple upside down shots!\n\nWhat we ordered: \nTomahawk Ribeye -- My dad enjoyed this. Perfectly cooked (medium rare) & great flavor.\nPorterhouse -- If you're looking for a good amount of meat, this is a great choice. \nBrooklyn Filet -- Probably my FAVORITE of the bunch. Amazing texture & great flavor. Melt in your mouth deliciousness!!! \nSeabass -- Lobster risotto was amazing! Sauce was a bit on the salty side. Added a bit of lemon and it was perfect. \nLobster curry -- Tasty, but I would recommend a steak. Wasn't worth it to get this dish here as there are other great dishes. \nSides: Creamy mashed potatoes, Asparagus, Tater toes - all were DELICIOUS! \n\nIf you're looking for a great steak restaurant I highly recommend this place.

We had made reservations for a group of 6 people online and were seated promptly. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. I regret not getting his name because he was wonderful. \n\nI ordered the Berrylicious cocktail which was delicious. The garnish was beautiful and was surprised that it was a decent pour of vodka. A friend ordered the cucumber martini and loved it. \n\nSince it was our last night in Vegas, my fiance and I decided to go all out and we ordered The Ultimate Surf & Turf. It's $175 but it's made for two people to share. Honestly it would have fed four grown men, but it was so delicious that we couldn't stop eating it. The porterhouse was amazing. It was cooked a perfect medium as requested. It came with two types of dipping sauces but we didn't bother using either one because the steak was so delicious. I thought the New York Strip side of the porterhouse was the best steak I've ever had, until I tried the filet side. OMG! Talk about melt in your mouth.\n\nThe lobster was a ginormous two pounds and was very easy to eat. It was delicious and buttery and the tail was already out of the shell for convenience. I don't even know what the lobster was stuffed with but I don't care because it was so good.\n\nFor our sides we ordered the mac n cheese, which was perfectly creamy and cheesy and came out in an iron skillet. We also had asparagus which was perfectly cooked.\n\nWe regretfully didn't have room for dessert but they all sounded amazing. Five stars for great service, great food and a great time! Well done!"

I had to order a second serving.\n\nThe tator tot side dish was $10 for 6 tots. Practically robbery! The lamb shank was the only offering that looked hearty and filling, however the portions compensate for the lack in flavor. I'd rather eat 2 bites of heaven than scarf down a plate full of crap. \n\nFood was good, but here is my only complaint: when I drop $150 for a 2person dinner I expect to be happy and sluggish, not longing for a snack 30 mins later. And we ordered like kings: 2 servings of Hot Rocks, side of spinach, whipped potatoes and tator tots, cream of tomato soup with mini grilled cheese sandwiches, lamb shank, and tuna fish tacos.

Not to start off as a sexist creep, but the skimpy skirts the waitresses had on were the reason I gave them 3 stars in lieu of 2.  Wow.  \n\nWe had 7:00 reservations and arrived early to grab a drink at the bar.  Very cool bar area with plenty of casual seating in an upscale restaurant.  Prior to grabbing a drink at the bar, we checked in with the hostess to let her know we had arrived.  Despite reservations at 7:00, we weren't seated until a little after 7:30.  This reminded me of a Seinfeld episode ... they had no problem \"taking\" the reservation ... they just couldn't \"hold\" the reservation ... and that's the most important part!\n\nWe were seated in the way back in a more private (and roomy) area, which was nice.  The server introduced himself and said he and another gentleman would be taking care of us.  What we didn't know was that \"taking care\" had a different meaning to them, I suppose.  We had terrible/slow service the entire night and at one point EVERY single glass at the table needed a refill (no exageration).  There were only 6 of us, but apparently the table of 10 next to us (and seated 10 minutes after we put in our order) had no problem getting their food before us.\n\nAs for the food ... it was phenomenal.  This is where they made up for crummy service.  As a table, we had the big seafood tower appetizer, which was fantastic.  I had a bone-in ribeye that was cooked to perfection along with a twice-baked potato.  The place was pricey, but we knew that having looked at the menu ahead of time, so no big deal.  Our table of 6 probably spent somewhere in the $600 range.  Too bad for Stack they seated us 35 minutes late or else we would have had dessert, coffee, and after-dinner drinks as well (probably another $150).  Instead, we had to book it to Beatles Love.\n\nSo ... the Quick and Dirty review:\n\nAtmosphere - Great (scantily clad waitresses, dimly lit restaurant, good music)\nService - Poor (wasted reservation, lack of attention)\nFood - Fantastic (seafood tower, steak, and twice-baked potato were all delicioso)\n\nSummary - Service is more important than anything ... Stack disappointed in this area.  However, they make up for it in the menu and atmosphere."

Best mac and cheese balls I'd ever had. \n\nI liked that the location was still intimate and not set up to be packed to the gills. After fighting your way through the clubs, streets and hotels it was a nice breather. \n\nService was also excellent."

Even on Valentine's Day we waited no longer than 2 minutes to be sat.\n\nI was born and raised in San Diego, CA so it's nearly impossible to impress me with seafood since it was a weekly meal in my home. But when I say that the stuffed lobster was by far the most amazing thing I've ever eaten, I mean it. I had a sea bass that would put anything in San Diego to shame.\n\nThe only thing better than our food (which I wasn't sure was possible) was our waiter, Dennis. He was patient, friendly, informative, and made us feel like we were life long friends within the first few minutes. A perfect example of friendly and professional. \n\nWe will be returning for the lobster and for Dennis."

            "review": "We were looking for a decent place to grab dinner before KA, and everything at the MGM Grand was booked up (private parties on a fight night), we were staying at TI, and Stack had decent reviews next door at the Mirage. As one of the Mirage's \"find dining\" locations, I expected A LOT MORE. \n\nYou are greeted by loud music and walk through the bar on your way to the table... hoping the club beats will abide as you move into a beautiful dining area. But it doesn't. I understand this is Vegas, and they want you to move from their restaurant into their club, but when spending ~$150/person on dinner I expect to be able to hear my date over the music. \n\nOur first server (I *think* we had two, not sure really because there was no continuity) talked very fast, and nervously. After he calmed down he was nice and courteous, but barely knowledgeable about the menu. The specials were rehearsed, not even sure if he knew exactly what they were. Food came fairly quickly after ordering, but service after that was scarce. \n\nWe started off with the tuna, and it was overcooked in a sauce with little flavor. Topped with slices of Serrano peppers it was a unique presentation, but nothing I would order again. \n\nThe steak was great, both of ours (NY strip & fillet) came out perfectly done and extremely flavorful. Two different steak sauces were served, one delicious red wine and a tasty peppercorn. The steaks are the only reason why Stack gets 3 stars instead of the 2 I'm inclined to give it. \n\nThe side dishes were just OK, my baked mac n' cheese was acceptable, but nothing to go back for. My wife ordered the sauteed spinach, there's only so much you can expect out of that, but this could have been dropped from a can and microwaved. \n\nThe wine list may have been long, but the selection and prices were horrible. We ended up with a Pine Ridge Merlot, ~$65 for a bottle we can by for $5 at the local grocery store. Other cellars and vintages that can be bought for $10 (Beringer, Red Diamond) rounded out their ~$100 categories. \n\nWhen I asked for some sort of bread to be served with dinner I felt like I was being a bother, and although I wasn't charged for it, when it did come out it was warm, but hard and tough as though it had been reheated. \n\nOverall I think it would be a great place to come with a group of friends or for a party. If you're looking to sit at a bar and grab some good drinks and food this would be a good stop, just stick with the mixed drinks and stay away from the wine. But if you're looking to sit down for a nice dinner I would recommend looking somewhere else. While I hate making comparisons, value and service wise, a place like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse would give you a much better experience for the same money."

It was his first time to Vegas, my second, and we went for a quick walk and decided upon the Mirage, \"just because.\"\n\nThe hostess, a blonde babe that is a dime a dozen in this town, did smile at first, asking if we wanted to sit in the dining room or the bar, and me, being ever so charming, replied, \"whichever is nicer.\"  And this ice cold facade came up on her part and she goes, \"well, it's really up to you.\"  Come on! The Ritz in Paris, if you ask any member of the staff whether you should sit in the Ritz Bar, the Bar Vendome or the Bar Hemingway, you will automically get, \" definitely the Bar Hemingway.\"  And honey, Stack at the Mirage aint no Paris Ritz!\n\nWe chose the dining-room, which was dark, chic, upscale, etc.  It was half empty when we arrived, but the Ice Queen had the desire to sit us close to a group sitting nearby.  As the evening progressed, the restaurant filled up, not gradually, but almost all at once.  We got beers and figured that you'd have to expect some round of bitchiness in such a place. \n\nOur waitress was nice, yet she let the two other dudes do all the work, and didn't really seem concerned with our well being after we received our steaks, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach - it's very run of the mill steakhouse, yet the food was really good, but with the douchebag attitide, you feel like you should get what you paid for.  \n\nRight?"

From the outside It didn't seem very crowded and it looked very modern inside (very aesthetically pleasing), so my gf and I decided to get a bite to eat there. The nice lady hostess seated us to our table and I really liked the ambience. There was a bachelorette party taking place near the main bar and they didn't seem too crazy. :)\n\nI liked that the house/trance music was not too loud and it had a rich and immense clarity of sound, that an audiophile would appreciate! Maybe similar to Bowers & Wilkins speakers. I never had to yell or text to communicate with my gf; the volume was just right!\n\nWe weren't too hungry, nor did we want to take left overs, so we opted for the \"signature small plates\". My gf ordered Miso Habachi Skewers and I ordered the Mini Lamb Gyros and they were both amazing! There were small portioned, although they seemed like the perfect amount for us at that time. My gf's small plate came with a little hot grill to keep the meat warm on the skewers and it also had a rich peanut butter sauce; quite tasty! My mini gyros came in a little platter with a creamy cucumber yogurt sauce and they were to die for! I enjoyed that it was like perfect temperature; not too hot or cold, just right! \n\nMy gf ordered a dessert (warm chocolate cake) and it came with vanilla ice cream and a chocolate stick on the side. I had a taste and I believe this was the best chocolate lava cake I ever had! It melts in your mouth! On top of the ice cream there was a white round coin-shaped piece, depicting red letters \"STACK\". We thought it was plastic and to make sure we took a bite and it turned out that it was white chocolate.\n\nThe only aspect of our dinner, that I was not fond of, was our first waiter. He seemed a little cocky and seemed didn't want to be there. Good thing that we had the pleasure of a new courteous waiter after we received our entr\u00e9es. I think he had short blonde hair but anyway, he was great and it make our night more enjoyable!\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant/bar at the Mirage!"

I can very confidently say mission accomplished on that front.\n\nNumber one, I might have changed our reservation time 3 times on open table the day we were going to Stack and it didn't seem to be a problem at all. We got the Mirage and walked straight to the restaurant. After talking to the hostess, we probably waited for five minutes while they set our table for 8. \n\nFirst things first: I loved the atmosphere of this place as soon as we walked in. It was classy and dimly lit, but not TOO dimly lit. It just seemed like a cool place to be when having a nice dinner. ALSO, we got a round table for our party of 8 which I was extremely happy with. I'm not a big fan of having people at opposite ends of a rectangular table and this huge round table they sat us at let everyone talk with each other during dinner. BIG plus. \n\nSecond: If you come here make sure to check in on Yelp! We got 8 free shots just for checking in. (Granted they were pink and tasted like lemonade, but what can you expect?) \n\nThird: The food. was. fantastic. I was a little nervous when we walked in and it wasn't busy at all but that might be because we were in Vegas and having dinner at 6:30 pm.... Anyway. That didn't end up being a problem. The Caesar salad was one of the best I've ever had - crispy and fresh lettuce, well dressed. The sides we all got to split were also excellent - the adult tater tots and the mac and cheese. We got two of each and there was a little bit left over for 8 of us. Most of us went with the filet mignon for our entree and we were rewarded for our choice. My steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and the compote butter on top added a ton of flavor to each bite. I got my filet with the shrimp scampi and they were done very well. \n\nAll in all it was just a great experience. The service was prompt, polite, and helpful. I'd recommend Stack to anyone who is staying near the Mirage as it is worth your time and money."

Most of the luxury hotels have their own steak restaurants, and I can't comment on those as I didn't try them.\n\nBoth the wife and I tried the filet mignon and mashed potatoes.  Additionally I had a cocktail with my meal.  As stated in other reviews, everything is ordered a la carte.  \n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was fancy, though it was very dark as some have mentioned.  I didn't mind this, as tables are fairly close to one another and the darkness helps give a more private feel than could be achieved with more light given the tables proximity to one another. \n\nService was top notch.  Drinks were refilled quickly, food brought out promptly, and everyone was professional and friendly.\n\nWe both agreed that the steak was cooked perfectly.  Both steaks were extremely tender and flavorful.  We both order the steaks cooked medium and they came as expected with a warm, just slightly brown center.  Neither of us have had the opportunity to go to a lot of high end steak houses, but I have been to a couple, and this was in my opinion the best steak I have had. The mashed potatoes were also very good.  My wife is a huge starch fan and deemed them the best mashed potatoes she has ever had.\n\nThe cocktail was a Long Island Iced Tea.  I am not a wine fan, which I am sure if you had the taste for it would have accompanied this meal nicely, but the cocktail was very well done and obviously made with premium liquors.\n\nAll and all this place was great for a special occasion.  Prices reflect the service and quality of the food.  Don't go if you aren't willing to let yourself forget about the check for the night.  I don't see myself going back to Las Vegas anytime soon, but I would definitely go back if I found myself in the area."

If I could break it down, I'd give 1-1/2 stars for service and 4-1/2 for food, so I guess three stars is the best I can do.\n\nReally, REALLY surprised that this place is as big of a hot mess as it is, considering it's not new. It's been around for a while, but you'd think it was the newest hottest restaurant on the strip - and without giving its staff proper training. The reason I'm complaining about this first and foremost is because I was here during CES - the Consumer Electronics Show - which is in Las Vegas every year. So, one would think the staff and management would be aware of this ~little annual trade show that brings in more than 100,000 people.\n\nFirst off - hostess. Wow, attitude much? Honey, if you can't handle all these guests in your restaurant with grace and aplomb, might I suggest another line of part-time work? And, blaming everything from being over-booked to OpenTable is NOT the way to make sure your potential guests feel good about choosing Stack over the other amazing restaurants in Vegas. I don't know, maybe talk to the manager of comping drinks for those of us who had reservations weeks ago...or something to make us feel welcome and that you're truly sorry about the craziness of the restaurant that night. But, that's just me...\n\nWe finally - FINALLY - got seated after an hour-long wait...with no one checking to see if we're okay or wanted anything to snack on while waiting or even complimentary drinks. And nary an apology was in sight. That's just f**ked up. \n\nSo, after getting seated, it took forever to get a waiter over to get our menus and drink orders. What was really confusing is that one waiter came over and gave us his name and the name of this \"team\" that would be serving us that night...then the head guy (or who I assumed was our lead waiter since he came up to us and introduced himself) disappeared. Yeah...completely. Some other guy, who did NOT seem like a happy camper was helping us...and I'm using the term \"help\" loosely here. \n\nGenerally don't do this, but I asked for the manager first thing. I mean, from the way the hostess treated us to the ridiculous wait for a waiter... *sigh* The manager seems like a nice guy, but I don't think he's well-respected by his staff. Nothing much changed.\n\nAnyway...enough of that. Now about the food. I have to give the kitchen major props. Though, I should preface this by saying we were STARVING, so I don't know how biased I am about the food...\n\nThe food is great. That pretty much sums it up. My part of eight ordered a variety of appetizers and sides as appetizers and wow. Portions are on the small side, but if you order a variety, your entire party can enjoy little bites and not ruin their appetites. From the garbage salad and tater-tots to the pigs-in-a-blanket and chicken wings...we pretty much finished everything on all these small plates. Entrees were good-sized portions, we had steaks to chicken to pasta - and everyone cleaned off their plates. No complaints...and considering we staved off our hunger with the appetizers, I think it's a good sign that the food was actually good.\n\nDessert was as good as I've had in any restaurant...not too sickeningly sweet, but not so bland you wondered why you even bothered, The sampler dessert plate is the way to go for a little bit of everything for a larger party, especially if not everyone is into desserts.\n\nSo, to sum up my ridiculously long rant? If you can get past the unprofessional front of the house staff and you don't go during a major trade show where there are a ton of people around...then I recommend Stack."
