            "review": "We had dinner here after our wedding.  We are from Oklahoma, so I had to book and make decisions based off of reviews.  \nI dealt with Natalie, the catering manager, and she was so helpful.  I changed our dinner time on 2 different occasions and she was more than accommodating.  We even had some special requests outside of the normal catering menu.\nWhen we arrived for dinner everything was set up and ready to go.  The food was very good, many of our guests said it was their best meal while in Vegas and the guacamole was the best they've ever had!    The service was great and friendly!!\n\nI definitely recommend this place for group events and we will be visiting again on our next trip to Vegas!!\n\nThank you for making our special day go smooth!"

Felipe was our server but he was also the bartender for the whole bar. Needless to say,  we got our drinks after 20 minutes of waiting. The appetizer didn't arrive until our food did which was 30 minutes later. I will not be back here. The food was really good, but because of the service I won't be back. If you go there make sure you're not very hungry so you won't mind the long wait."

Forgot to bring us waters after she offered to. Baja fish tacos and chicken nachos. Tacos better. Tasted tomatos salsa awesome. We ate out on the patio and had a niece view of foot traffic going up and down the strip."

We split the fajita platter and it was enough for two of us. The veggies were fresh and grilled. We had cherry tomatoes cooked on the grill. Also asparagus. The guacamole was really good too. Yummy.

The fruit, frozen margaritas were so fresh and yummy, although slightly pricey; just get the 32 oz one, better bang for your buck. Definitely get the bottomless chips and salsas and ask for their hotter salsa to go with it. It was all really good. My table ordered quesadillas and tortillas soup, no complaints on the food. Also a nice atmosphere sitting on the outdoor patio. Would definitely recommend this place."

We obviously like El Segundo Sol since we have a lot of choices when it comes to Mexican restaurants in the Las Vegas/Henderson area.\n\n  Our server was GREAT! her name was Travina (sp?) very pleasant and she had NO attitude because the use of the Travel Zoo coupon/offer. she was a delight will ask for her section on our next visit~\n\n We started with margaritas & guacamole/chips. The guac was a VERY generous portion for 2 people and tasted outta sight!!! I ordered the chicken enchiladas (2 per order) with green sauce and they were the BEST I have EVER eaten, REALLY!! the shredded chicken was still moist & the green sauce had a bit of citrus in it and wasn't overly spicy...all just devine. I would be hard pressed not to order this same item again.\n\n  No dessert as we were quite satisfied, and this was only lunch time so a walk around Fashion Show Mall for a little exercise was next on OUR menu."

Just another fancy overpriced restaurant on the strip that serves what they think is Mexican food. \n\nI came here for a work lunch so alcohol was out of the question. Maybe if I had a few drinks, the food would have tasted a little better. I ordered the tortilla soup and chipotle Cesar salad. The soup itself tasted like a can of chillies blended with a can of tomatoes. I probably got about 3 table spoons of actual pieces of tortilla, chicken and beans. I couldn't even get half way before I just have up. The salad was wilted and not fresh. And I don't know about you, but I don't think Cesar dressing is supposed to be sour. A few people at my table ordered chicken enchiladas and burritos and they all agreed the chicken was a bit dry. I tried the cilantro rice and it was complete mush. The consensus at my table was that the food was just ok. Highlight of the meal was the chips and guacamole. Pretty sad I would say."

I got the chicken salad which was tasty although there truly wasn't a lot of chicken on it and what was there was a little charred.  My husband and daughter didn't want rice and beans so they ordered the street tacos (on the bar menu).  They enjoyed them but they are small and at $3/each that adds up.  My son ordered the mahi tacos and his meal was probably the best of the bunch.  It was a $20 plate but he had fixings for five tacos and he actually ate the rice/beans.  My husband and I split a \"meh\" frozen margarita, e.g., not enough tequila to balance the sweetness.  Finally, I got a weird vibe from our waitress.  I asked her several menu questions (what's in the salad, can you order items a la carte, etc).  Not hard questions but I got the impression that she was irritated.  Not cool."

I figured when you're in vegas, everything is expensive anyway. But our waitress was really cool and the catering manager, Kori, was tremendously helpful.

            "review": "To be fair, my expectations were misaligned from reading the reviews. I did not realize this was a restaurant in a mall that had more of a chain feel to it. It was not what I was looking for and started the evening off wrong. The acoustics were not great and it was difficult to have a conversation over dinner. They had several large groups roll in and it just got very noisy. Had I been looking for something for a group with a great tequila selection, this is the place. \n\nSo, if you have your expectations set appropriately, this could be a fun place, but fine dining it is not and it is on the pricey side. Our waiter, Victor, was very attentive and informative. He did great. I was looking at the carne asada tacos, but noticed they had pork belly in a speciality dish. I asked if they could do pork belly tacos and he was able to make it happen. They were very good. My girlfriend's carne asada was also cooked very well and flavorful. Their chips and salsa were great with the serrano salsa being the best. Their specialty hot habanero was too strong on the habanero flavor, but had great heat. I would say skip the guacamole. It was not as flavorful as it should have been and was far from spicy. \n\nThey do have an excellent selection of tequila, but our mixed drink seemed light on the tequila.  It is unlikely that I will return when back in Vegas, but this works for a lot of people and may be worth trying if you have the right mindset."

            "review": "This place was just a waste of time & money. First of all, it's another americanized restaurant serving unoriginal \"mexican\" food. Food is alright, nothing special. Margaritas are weak. I ordered a large margarita with a double shot. When the waitress brought it out it was really small in size, and tasted like pure margarita mix. Customer service is horrible. All servers I encountered were rude. \n\n I ordered the bottomless chips & salsa. They brought out one half empty basket of chips & 1 salsa. I politely told the waitress that I had ordered the bottomless chips with the 3 salsas. She then rolled her eyes and snatched the basket from my table and mumbled a \"sorry\". 10 minutes later, (still no chips & salsa)  a different waitress comes by and rudely drops a bowl of guacamole, and then walks away. I tried to get her attention before she walked away but she literally just dropped it and took off. Was everyone having a bad day? A few minutes later my original waitress came by and I explained to her what happened, she was half listening and looking in some other direction and just said..\n \"Oh,...well ok, so you don't want the guacamole?\"\n\"No, I never ordered it, but I'm still waiting on my bottomless chips\"\nShe picks up the guacamole rolls her eyes and walks away. WTF. I didn't even say it rude or anything. I said it in the sweetest voice I could. I've seen the movie \"waiting\", I was too scared to piss her off, then later find a loogie in my food. So I let it go.\n\nI finally ordered my food and my super weak margarita. Waited for almost 25 minutes before getting my food. It wasn't even busy! There were maybe three other tables besides mine. By now my patience was wearing thin. I just wanted to eat my crappy expensive food and get out of there. I ate as quickly as possible.  I asked for my check, and again waited a pretty long while. I saw my waitress just standing there chatting with another co-worker, at this time, I've had it. So I went up to the waitress and told her I've been waiting way too long and I needed to go NOW. She handed me the check, and of course she had charged me for the guacamole. I told her...she said she'll fix it.... then she disappeared, and I had to wait 10 more minutes! I don't think I've ever spent this much time in a restaurant trying to \"get out\". I felt like a hostage. I was just sitting there on an empty table, w/ my doggy bag in my hands. Finally she got back, and I rudely snatched the receipt out of her hands and stormed out.\n\nI can honestly say I'm never going back to that hell hole. The staff needs a serious attitude makeover. They're lucky they got two stars. 1 star for the location and 1 star for the huge and not so bad tasting quesadilla."

I stopped here after a long stay in Vegas before driving home to California and I was very full! Portion size is large and very filling. Ordered the bottomless chips for an appetizer. Came with pico de gallo, salsa verde and a delicious smokey chipotle salsa. The chips and dips had me full before my entree arrived. For lunch I had the baja shrimp taco platter. The dish comes with delicious cilantro rice and black beans. I really loved the rice, as I am a huge cilantro fan. The black beans were solid and also tasty. The corn tortillas were sweet and soft, the platter came with five small corn tortillas, a nice large portion of fried shrimp and a green avocado/lime sauce as well as a chipotle crema. My only complaint is that I wish the shrimp had not been fried...there was too much batter on the shrimp and it did not add anything to the dish. Just freshly sauteed lime shrimp would have been much nicer. My partner's salmon tacos were also delicious and our friend's chimichanga was very very large, so large, he was unable to finish it. This place is not going to win any food awards for being authentic mexican, however it was very good, prices were decent for the strip and portion sizes were large. Atmosphere was fun, we sat near the bar, outside, with plenty of people watching."

It was chewy to the point my jaw got tired. Overall the fajitas were not impressive.

They would bring in one course of the meal, then disappear. I arrived later than the rest and it was a struggle to get a beer. I think there were a couple people who's drinks were attended to, but the rest of us generally were ignored. And why wouldn't we be? It was in their best interest to not ask if someone would like another drink.

We ordered a quesadilla plate, salad, and a very big michelada. The food and drink were served quickly and we were very happy with the food, it was delicious. I've had better micheladas but it was passable. I also liked their souvenir shirt so much that I bought one."

I have to admit it is hard not to order margaritas when every one else around you is getting one, but I do refrain! (I will stop by someday and get them as everyone on yelp is raving about them.) \n\nService has always reliable. They know the menu well and are good at making suggestions even when we don't follow them. ;-) They are quick to refill water or soft drinks. And of course the food is always awesome! We have had the combo fajitas several times and they are the current fav. Nachos and guac is our standard appetizer as well and it always disappear quickly.... \n\nYou know, I think I'll go to lunch there today!!"

They offer the classics that you yearn for like queso fundido and elote, which are both must tries. Also their margaritas are good. And a good margarita is never a bad thing. Although the prickly pear margarita is sweet, sweet, SWEET I give them points for including it on the menu. \n\nThe other reason (besides the amazing food) that El Segundo Sol is a place I love to frequent is the patio. OH, THAT PATIO. It is right off the strip and if you can get a table on the edge of the patio, people watching is a must. If you can't, which is likely for bigger groups and busier nights the entire patio is a dream. Lights, greenery, pi\u00f1atas and great music makes for a fantastic meal and experience. \n\nIf you are in town and not wanting to journey far from the strip, El Segundo Sol is a must."

Very delectable and with an upscale feel. You may get some initial sticker shock (though, not worse than most anywhere else on the Strip), but the presentation and taste make it worth it.\n\nAnd the margaritas are fantastic.

They have a cute outdoor seating area with makeshift trees.  We were the first ones there around 11 AM and were seated promptly.  Our waitress was very friendly and constantly kept checking on us.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n- Fresh-made Guacamole: DELICIOUS.  We had it made medium spicy and it was so good.  They give you a good portion, enough for 3-4 people.\n- Bottomless Chips and Salsa: The three salsas served are delicious.  Along with the salsa comes a huge order of chips.  You will not ask for a second round.  Its enough for 3-4 people.  Must have.\n- Vegetarian Tacos:  The soft tacos are tiny, served with rice, brown beans, salsa, and veggies.  I loved the tacos.  I was too full from the chips, but I still managed to eat at least 3 tacos.\n\nWe were in a rush to catch a flight, so the lunch was rushed.  We didn't get to see the dessert options.  But since our conference is an annual affair, we will surely be back next time we are in Vegas.  Definitely worth a try."

We stayed at the Wynn and just had to get away from the swanky atmosphere. I wanted a place where I can sit outside, have a few beers ( or a few too many), watch the game, watch the people, and have some decent food. That is what I found at el Segundo, and that is why I keep coming back.\n\nAtmosphere- casual, Mexican cantina. They have a bar outside on the patio, along with plenty of seating. They have another bar inside with plenty of seating as well. Both bar are equipped with tvs that will allow you to watch the game. They accommodate large groups easily and without any complaints.\n\nFood- the menu is the perfect size. It covers a lot of various foods, but isn't a novel. We had nachos which were huge, and also very good. The tacos were good and the chips and salsa....... Amazing. We have never had a bad experience there. I have recommended this place to a few other people, and everybody enjoys it.\n\nService- top notch. Our server was always close by , and my beer was never empty for long.

If you are a reality star, then your lower intelligence will probably con you into thinking this restaurant is great; as the tiny portions of crappy food will keep you skinny and hungry. But if you are one of these types, please stop telling people how wonderful such horrific restaurants like this are. Just went for the review acclaimed happy hour yesterday with 4 people, and it sucked BIG TIME! The street tacos were literally one bite, and the chicken was gross, the steak was charred and they tasted disgusting. The chips were unsalted and very burnt tasting, and the salsas were nothing more than jarred grocery store taste. In addition, the salsa cups were so small that you couldn't even get your chip wet. Prickly pear margarita tasted too sweet, and should have been  more tart. Loaded nachos with chicken were like eating a wet bowl of cheeese goo, and nothing good about them. Quesadillas were overcooked and just plain wrong. You could literally order 20 street tacos for one person, and get about 3 regular size tacos in food quantity. Quality of food is poor, taste of food is poor, quantity of food is a RIP OFF. Happy hour is guaranteed to make anyone unhappy enough to never come back here again for anything. This is really sad because happy hour should make one want to come back for more, but sadly not here. STAY FAR AWAY from this establishment, it won't get better!"

My wife that hates avocado was even willing to taste it and ended up loving it too. That brings me to my chicken Tinga enchiladas accompanied by black beans and cilantro rice. Wow super tender, juicy, well seasoned chicken filling and the green sauce!! amazing. My wife order the combo fajitas, steak was tender almost melt in your mouth!!! seasoned to perfection.

We told her no, but there were no smaller tables, and we are more than happy to let someone else sit with us, if needed.  She kind of gave us a dirty look and walked away.  About 5 minutes later, she silently filled our water glass, and gave us menus... the REGULAR menu, and walked away, again, in silence.  When she finally reappeared, we asked if we cold possibly get the HAPPY HOUR menu.  Instead of just getting it and bringing it over, she had the young man who was busy taking drink orders bring it to us...ten minutes later (not his fault, he in fact, was the only redeeming thing about the place).  We ordered a few appetizers, which were actually very good.  The chips, salsas, and guac, were fantastic,  the margaritas were wonderful.

(Hey management, apparently, your staff don't like their jobs, hire some people who would be grateful to have one).\n\nSorry El Segundo, I will not be recommending this establishment to any guest of mine.  You will find them all next door, at Strip Burger, with the fun, cool bartender and awesome wait staff.\n\nSoon after writing this reveiw, the owner/partner of the establishment reached out to me to apologize for my experience.

Went here with a group of co-workers while in town for a conference and most of us ordered the shrimp taco \"special\" and two others ordered fajitas. The fajitas came out hot and sizzling but everyone else's shrimp dishes came out ice cold. The cocktails took way too long to arrive and we had to ask for water 2 or 3 times as our pitchers were always empty but there was no one around to refill them. Don't quite understand why the service was so slow for a Saturday night when the place wasn't nearly full."

I vowed to come only for that after eating here on my birthday one year. \n\nThe entrees were alright, but they were bland. That seriously sums it up. I had the spicy ground beef mexican pizza. Bland. No spice. Not even any beef flavor. I sampled someone else's chicken fajitas. Bland. Carne Asada tacos? You guessed it, bland! It was almost like they ran out of salt, pepper, and all other herbs and spices in the kitchen that night. The tortilla on the mexican pizza was dry and the top layer flaked away completely, leaving only the middle layer stuck to everything else. The only reason I stated that the food was alright and not terrible was because it was all cooked well (minus the tortilla on the mexican pizza, it was like licking the arm of the guy from Tales from the Crypt...)\n\nBack to the tableside guacamole, it's fresh, smooth, and citrus-y. I loved it so much that I started making it at home occasionally. The head chef posted his recipe in VegasSeven Magazine one year and I've been hooked. The sangria and cocktails just bring the whole experience together.\n\nLike RA sushi, this place is LOUD! Don't come for conversation with a date or long lost relatives...come to eat and drink and look at their pretty faces while listening to music being hammered out overhead. Otherwise, you'll spend the night incorrectly lip reading instead."

You can't beat $5 margaritas and you'll probably only need two at the most because man are they strong! The Big Stick is my favorite. Bartenders are friendly, helpful and cheery. The managers are always nice as well. They have quesadillas, nachos, chips& salsa and tacos on their happy hour menu. My friends and I always like to come down before we go out on the town. Great atmosphere. It's open to the strip so you can get some people watching in and the strip energy comes in. They have TVs in the bar area, so you're able to catch a game as well if that's your thing.\n\nAs for their regular menu they have delicious dishes as well. Granted, it's not at Chevy's prices but it's good quality and tastes awesome. Definitely cheaper than a lot of places on the strip! Must try the guacamole as well, it's made fresh and it's very tasty! I've always experienced excellent service as well as delicious food. I definitely recommend this place."

My companions went to eat in the food court two floors up but I decided I wanted something different, so my boyfriend and I came here.\n\nWe decided to try a few appetizers as not to ruin our appetites for dinner and ended up splitting an order of nachos with pulled chicken and tamales,which neither of us had ever had.\n\nService here wasn't super fast, they were kind of busy but not too busy. I'm not sure if the kitchen was just slow or something but service could have been faster and more... together. We had one server, then another and then another I think.\n\nThe nachos we had here were quite good - you can tell the nachos aren't from a bag here and if they were, they're pretty damned fresh. The chicken on top was nicely spiced and had been cooked in a sauce with some onions so that really added to the flavor of the nachos. The tamales were something else. I had no expectations on what a tamale would be like, so when I dug into the soft, almost mushy tamale, I didn't know what to expect.\n\nFlavor town indeed! WOW. So good. I was expecting something much more savory but this tamale was pretty sweet but it was SO good. I would try tamales anywhere after that experience. We split both dishes and couldn't quite finish but it was an excellent meal.\n\nOverall, aside from the slower service, the food here was excellent. I would come back, its in a good location and you can sit on a patio without being in direct sunlight after walking around the strip for a while."

We also got 2 margaritas each. I got mango and prickly pear! Omg best margaritas I've had! Not too strong, just right! They got strawberry and prickly pear. I had a sip of their strawberry and it was good too! \n\nDining area - I really like how they have the outdoor patio with bar, and inside it looks very nice and authentic!

I think they braise the beef because it had this luxuriousness to it that elevated the entire dish. So good. The menu had some interesting margaritas. The place isn't cheap, but considering the quality of the food and that it's the Las Vegas Strip, I thought the prices were pretty fair. And the service was friendly and efficient.

If you want more dressing up than a little pico de gallo and a wedge of lime (which is the \"traditional\" way), it was cost you another 90-cents or so for some lettuce, onion, tomato and avocado (as I recall, I did not go for the upgrade). \n\nWhat brought us in was the 2-for-1 coupons being handed out on the sidewalk. This was the only kind of card I wanted to grab, and as it turned out, it was a decent and tasty deal.\n\nI just can't over the price of the tacos, or the beer (a bucket of mini-Coronas for twenty-plus dollars). \n\nOther than price (it is Lost Wages after all) the tacos were quite tasty, just keep an eye out for those coupons.\n\nPS. The Yelp map is off for this location. El Segundo Sol is at the NE corner of the Fashion Show mall (Las Vegas Blvd. S and Dio Dr.), right next door to Stripburger.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the \"South\" is missing from the address and edited the business info.

Let cut to the chase and say if you come here, the best part is the guacamole which is made to order at the spice level you want and the amazing margaritas.  I had a skinny one so I can pretend I'm not getting a boat load of extra calories and it was one of the better ones that I've had.   The chips that came complementary were a little stale and although the service was ok, the food came to the table not piping hot and just average for a Mexican place."

This place was recommended by a local and she said this place had amazing Mexican food.  We came at like 10:30ish (I think) and was seated outside.  They covered up the overhang ceiling with fake trees and lights and you'd think it'd sound weird but it was kind of cute.\n\nOn to the food... we got chips and salsa, and gucamole as an appetizer.  We each ordered different margaritas to try and I had the organicos one with all organic ingredients (cause i'm into that shit).  It was delicious sweet and had the perfect amount of sour!  The chips with salsa and guacamole tasted delicious as well had beautiful presentation.  The salsa came out with 3 different salsas- a fresca, verde, and i think a spicy one.  My favorite was the verde and spicy.  The chips weren't too overly salted and the salsas tasted refreshing.  Usually I tend to be addicted to the salt in the chips and end up overeating but I was able to enjoy this as a true appetizer rather than overeating chips.  As far as the guacamole- it tasted amazingly fresh.\n\nI ordered the fajitas to share and it was also seasoned very well.  It came with 6ish flour tortillas with the sizzling platter in the middle with a few accompaniments on the side in little metal containers.  It came with sides of guac, 2 salsas, sour cream, and other stuff I forgot.  The fajita plate also had a small grilled corn!  I really like that the fajitas weren't dripping in oil or had the taste of cheap butter.  In most places where I've had fajitas, ever time you scoop up the onions and peppers they are just drenched in oil.  The flavors of the spices and cooked perfection really came out with the fajitas which is huge cause usually I will taste a faint of cheap butter which I'm not a fan of.  Bf had the salmon tacos which he didn't like but I had a bite of his salmon and thought it was cooked well.  Maybe it's because he isn't accustomed to tasting salmon in tacos since the usual fish is some white fish, but I thought the plate looked very aesthetically pleasing.\n\nI really enjoyed this meal and would definitely return.  Prices were very reasonable for a Vegas dinner coming to about $15-$18 for an average plate (not counting the few fancy items).  I wasn't amazed, but definitely impressed by the higher quality Mexican food."

It's enough for an appetizer for 4 or really good to pick at with their chips and salsa (complimentary) while drinking. My favorite margaritas are the cucumber mint which is very refreshing, or the pitaya ( cactus) tangy and a little sweet.\n\nThe food and service has fallen short for me too many times.  But I love the guacamole, drinks,  and atmosphere.  Plus there's decent people watching and it's conveniently located outside the mall."

I think the tacos were $2-3 each, but be warned that most of the portions here are on the small side.  I had 3 tacos and was not stuffed...

The rice was pretty average, and little on the salty side. The black beans were nothing special. The only things I thought was good were the chips and guacamole.\n\nBased on the other reviews/pics, this place seems to be decent for happy hour drinking.

There were seven of us total. Three people shared a nacho platter, one had enchiladas, one had quesadillas, one had soft tacos and I had crunchy tacos. \n\nFirst, the nacho trio asked for the guacamole on the side. There was a huge pile of guacamole on the top of the nachos. But they didn't complain and just ate around it.\n\nSecond, I asked if they had crunchy tacos because I didn't see it on the menu. The waiter said no. I looked more closely at the menu...there were crunchy tacos on the menu. Weird, I thought that the waiters were supposed to know the menu at the place they're serving at.\n\nThird, THEIR CRISPY TAC0S ARE SPICY!!! I'm really wimpy when it comes to spicy things. I can handle some heat, but whatever they put on these tacos was H0T!!! Like hot enough to at least mention on their menu or have the staff mention. I couldn't eat them. I told our waiter. It took like 20 minutes to get non-spicy tacos out to me. That was cool, everyone else was done with their meals and was watching me eat since it took so long. And why did it take so long? Because there were only like five other tables that had people at the them...they should have just gone over to the street window and have them make them for me. It probably would have been 15 minutes quicker.\n\nFourth, and here's when it gets messy and sort of dumb. We get our bill. Bottomless chips, check. Nachos, check. Enchiladas, check. Quesadilla, check. Soft tacos, check. Crunchy tacos + $3.95 fee for non-spicy chicken...annoying, but check. 3 sodas, check. Quesadillas, again? No, there were not two orders of quesadillas. We call over our waiter. \n\nUS: Excuse me, you charged us twice for the quesadillas. \nHIM: 0h yeah, I was going to take those off.\n\nUh, what? Weird response...if you were going to take the second one off, then why didn't you in the first place. \n\nReceive the new check.\n\nBottomless chips, check. Nachos, check. Enchiladas, check. Quesadilla, check. Crispy tacos, check. Soft tacos, check. Crispy tacos + $3.95 for non-spicy chicken. REALLY? IS THIS GUY F0R REAL? We didn't order 2 CRISPY TAC0S.\n\nAt this point, we're all just annoyed and wanted to get the eff out of there. We ended up going over to another waitress to fix the bill since our waiter was either trying to 1.) Get a bigger tip or 2.) Is incapable of being a server. \n\nThe manager came over...he was nice, as managers are supposed to be. He gave us $50 worth of gift cards for our troubles, which was a round of shots for us. \n\nI would give this place another chance...but I would ask for a girl server next time. Good luck to whoever encounters the waiter we had...hopefully he's fully trained or finds another job soon."

We are locals and repeat customers which is rare on the strip.  I have lived here for over 8 years and I like the food and service but my suggestion is that some people in this restaurant need to be more friendly to the customers.  I definitely come there less often then I used to because of Marcel and Sue.  As a matter of fact I have been coming there since Sue was a bartender.

Food critics in this city just don't know what great food tastes like and I've learned to avoid places they suggest and go to the ones they put down. Thank you CL for leading me to my new fave Mexican restaruant and discovering the coolest taco shack!\n\nI do miss Cafe Ba Ba Reba, but El Segundo Sol is AWESOME! The decor, the open patio, the wait staff, the food, the drinks, everything was AWESOME! The cerviche was so fresh and delicious as were the shrimp cocktail and the chicken tostadas and I could not stop eating the  homemade chips and salsas--they were addictive!\n\nAnd I can't forget to mention the margaritas, the cucumber mint margarita was refreshing and delicious (I could drink a pitcher!). Oh, and save room for desert, their tres leches is really to die for!"

The small amount of cheese they provided had solidified by the time they got to the table. The shredded beef tasted of nothing and was dried the f**k out! How could they screw up such a simple dish. I'm trying to have a good time with friends and that sad pile of nachos was too depressing to look at. I told them to take it back. I won't even get into the service it wasn't terrible, but why bother.\n\nI'm coming to realize that  Mexican food served on the Vegas Strip does not do any one any favors. Everyone thinks Mexican food should be good, priced fairly and served in an adequate portion. Fast service and free chips and salsa are just par for the course. El Segundo Sol never scores high in any of the categories. Ever!\n\nI heard of a happy hour and the bartender said it's only outside at Stripburger (same company) in the cold, dreary rain. She actually recommended we sit outside in the cold rain by heat lamps! What's wrong with people?"

We saw this thinking ehh looks overpriced but we are hungry. \nThe seating kinda sucked, but hey it was busy so we understand. \nThe waitress had a strong accent but hey it's a Mexican restaurant. My first thought was are they trying to be overly fancy here? The waitress would come and serve me water when we had the jug there. I can do it myself but a nice gesture. \nWhen we were ready to order the waitress would suggest to my gf what to get. She thought the tacos were all pre made but you get the tortillas and make em yourself with the Ingredients you get. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos thinking that sounded good. Turns out they were good anyways. For my first time having fish. Ha. Ha. \nAnyways my gfs plate was small cause she didn't order the beans/rice but she told the waitress never mind. The waitress had poor listening skills. The beans were really good and so were the tortillas. Other than that, this wasn't worth the price but still decent. I left no tip for the waitress having mediocre communication skills. \nAlso chips and salsa we ordered was pretty good. Nothing special."

I visited the restaurant on Friday night and left pretty pleased.  Notwithstanding the \"new opening\" hiccups that our party experienced, I recommend that you check this place out!\n\nMinus one star for not providing chips and salsa (you can purchase it for around 3 dollars but the salsas are nothing to write home about...they're all pretty bland).  However, if you're with a group, try the queso dip, it is amazing!!  It comes with small, in-house made corn tortillas.  So yum!\n\nThe drink selection is great.  I had a tableside margarita on the rocks and I was able to select my choice of tequila.  The server also had no problems customizing margarita orders.  And they offer a great and long selection of beers on tap.\n\nOn to the food!  I ordered the tacos al pastor and they were delicious!  The shredded pork arrived in a little covered black pot alongside rice, black beans and guacamole/sour cream.  And it was served with more of the homemade corn tortillas.  So, it became a make your own tacos platter.  I highly recommend ordering the al pastor.  A friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were wonderful!  I didn't try the carne asada entree but it arrived on an enormous plate and looked fantastic.  One side note: the rice is a little odd for a Mexican restaurant...it had an aroma almost like jasmine rice and it was very sticky like short grain rice.  It tasted alright, it just took some getting used to.\n\nMinus one more star for the prices.  They're pretty steep compared to other Mexican restaurants I've frequented, but then again, the restaurant's located on the strip so it's understandable.  The decor is great, especially if you sit outside under the trees (strung with twinkle lights!).  If you're craving Mexican, try this place out."

The chef should be ashamed that he sent it out of the kitchen, but that's what you get when you try to get three servings out of a ear of corn.\n\nI'm a local, and even the 25% discount they provide won't get me to step foot in this place again."

As Mexicans, we enjoyed the Mana that was playing. Unfortunately, as soon as we sat down the music changed to the likes of Jason Derulo and Lil Wayne fans.\n\nThe food, however, was delicious and tasted pretty authentic. The chips and salsa were amazing. All three salsas were delicious. The parentals ordered the guacamole which I'm guessing they loved because they devoured it. \n\n I opted for the Chicken Tacos which were served with Mexican Rice and Black beans. Let me just say, yuum! The tortillas were served rolled up in a tin, which is pretty convenient. \n\nMom ordered the Chile Relleno. When it comes to Chile Relleno's she's very critical because \"none are better than the one's she makes.\" But, she seemed to love it. \n\nI'm giving it 4 stars for the not so Mexican music that played through out our visit. It is a \"Mexican\" restaurant after all. I believe this restaurants belongs to the same owners as Mon Ami Gabi. As a themed restaurant, I expected the music to follow."

I had heard about El Segundo Sol through Yelp, Restaurant.com etc.  So we decided to check it out one day for lunch.  It was mid January but still nice out so we sat outside right by the sidewalk.  That was a mistake, we sat down and within 5 minutes, a bird pooped on my husbands arm.  No I'm not blaming the restaurant for this but it just didn't start off good.  \n\nWaitress shows up to let us know about specials and takes drink orders.  I order a special pomegranate something margarita for $10 and my husband orders a \"regular\" margarita off the menu at either $8 or $9...  She brings them and okay I'm from Wisconsin and maybe my perspective on a $8-$10 drink is different but it was like a juice glass, like a baby juice glass.  Talk about sipping, because I couldn't convince myself to pay for another at that price.  \n\nWe ordered the salsa trio and guac.  Both were very tasty and plentiful.  Seemed fresh, we got to order the guac in mild, medium or hot.  I opted for medium and it did have some good flavors but not overpowering.  I didn't find the prices that bad, $4 for chips and salsa, $10 for guac because it was good, fresh, plentiful.\n\nWe both ordered the special lunch which was a trio of tacos (tuna, beef and chicken).  I think each plate was $18 and came with rice and beans.  Food was tasty but just so expensive for what was served.  Also the wait to get the food seemed to take forever. My husband was digging into his rice and beans when low and behold... he found a hair.  Sigh...  Then he had more bird poop in his water glass which he almost drank (until it was almost up to his mouth) because he is not a refined sipper like me.  \n\nI gotta hand it to him, he didn't loose his cool.  He pushed his rice and beans aside and told the waitress very discreetly.  She sent the manager over and they did compensate us for his meal, which they didn't have to do.  I thought that was pretty stand up of them.   \n\nWas the food quality good?  Yes.  Was it worth the $$, time waiting and pain in the butt?  Nope.  If anyone was dead set on going there I would tell them, get the quac, salsa and a bucket of beers."

The street tacos that are served there as well are another plus when you are looking for something quick and good to eat.\n Now as for the reason for the two stars...Food is one thing and a huge part of a good review but what hurt this resturant in my eyes was the service. We were seated quickly and that was very nice, our waiter took our order  and had our drinks to us in no time, then that was the last we seen of him. Well we seen him but he was tending to the groups of three or more. And this was not to say that the place was packed, because when we go there the bar was not even full and that was the section we were in. I seen more of the bus boys, who brought our food to us and refilled our drinks. I had to get napkins and silverware from the table next to us since the waiter did not bring our food he would not have known that we needed them. Then when we were done with our \"endless chips\" we had to flag down another waiter to bring us our refill. Later when it was time to leave since we did not feel the need to stay, the bill was rang up incorrectly. I did not understand how we got happy hour prices on the food but not the drinks..Well luckily one of the managers or at least the men in suits were around because of course the waiter was missing. They corrected the order and we got the right bill...And that explains the zero tip left to our waiter.  \n Overall the resturant was nice, the decor was awesome, and maybe we just got the raw end of the deal on the section that we sat in...But thats why I gave the two stars."

Chips are way to salty. \nTamale corn flavor is great but there is no other flavor. \nThe Margaritas are strong but tiny and over priced. Also have little taste but the tequila. \nI feel the servers are stretched to thin as service was a little slow but friendly."

Lots of outdoor seating (with heaters right now!) and indoor space, right on the strip so good for people-watching.\n\nI went down for a quick lunch the other day, and it was so good I doubled back a second time for dinner with the hub in tow - he totally agreed!\n\nThe guacamole, which they can do spicy or super spicy (go for the super) is great, and there's LOTS of it for the price, fabulous value at $10! Comes with a baking sheet of crispy tortillas that almost resemble fritos in taste, really unusual and really good. Comes with 2 bowls of salsa - all this is easily enough for an appetizer for 3-4 people, or a lunch with leftovers for 1! For an additional $3.95, they'll give you bottomless chips and salsa.\n\nToday we had the mahi mahi tacos, which was not a good value for $18.95 and a portion of fish about the size of 4 fingers, but it was decidedly delicious nonetheless. Comes with very flavorful white rice, black beans, pico de gallo, slaw, and a couple of little sauces.\n\nTheir margaritas are awesome, as is their sangria, which is homemade. This will be a go-to for fast, delicious bites - and it's right next door to another great joint, Stripburger! A definite be-back!"

The items on the Loco Hour aren't even that discounted. The bottomless chips and salsa seem very cheap...until you look at the original menu and see that they're $2.95 all the time! The drinks are discounted by about $2. The only thing I found to be a pretty good value were the burritos and tacos. On the regular menu, the tacos are only served in platters that will run you about $15, but you can get then for $2 a piece on the Loco Hour menu. The burritos don't even exist on the regular menu, but you can get them for $4.93 on the Loco menu (+.95 to make it fully loaded). They're stuffed with fresh guacamole, sour cream, pickled jalapeno, shredded lettuce, rice beans, and meat. I didn't order one for myself, but I had a bite of Don's and it was delish! The pork was very soft and the guacamole was so fresh and chunky. I'm also a sucker for burritos with rice inside. I just wish they'd learn how to wrap them up better. They were wrapped like enchiladas. Thankfully, Don's teenage job was at Del Taco, so he fixed that problem in a flash. The guacamole came in a giant mortar. We didn't expect to get so much guacamole, but we had no problem eating it all anyway. \n\nThe ambiance was nice. We came at exactly 4pm in the middle of the week, so there weren't that many people there. There are strings of little light bulbs hanging from the dark wooden ceiling and there is a lot of light from outside in the bar area during the day. The bathrooms are pretty fancy too (if you can ignore the piping under the sinks). Each stall and sink  is separated by a tile wall and there are lots of places to hang your bags or coats. \n\nOverall, the place was nice. I'd come back here for the Loco Hour burritos if I ever happened to be walking around Fashion Show mall between 4-7pm and craving a burrito (not very likely), but not for anything else."

The great part was the owner and general manager reached out to me to discuss the problems I had at the restaurant.  These guys are terrific and have excellent customer service skills.  They very politely asked if I could come back and enjoy the restaurant once again because I was an avid advocate of this establishment until I had a poor experience on my last visit.\n\nFirst let me state that my return trip was excellent.  I went there with a friend and everyone from the hostess, the waiter to the manager provided excellent service.  And the food was perfect.  For the appetizer I ordered the traditional chips and salsa.  If you have not tried this you should.  The chips come with three types of salsa: a hot, mild and a Verde.  They are all excellent.  I ordered the tuna tacos which came with rice and red beans and a few mixed drinks.  I ordered the tacos since that is something I've not had before and wanted to venture into uncharted territory.  The food did not disappoint.  I highly recommend  El Segundo to anyone who likes Mexican Food along with a fun environment"

Food quality was great, especially assemble-yourself fish tacos, and the sangria's made the evening even more enjoyable....but the \"ding\" I have to give is on their service.\n\nNothing more can ruin a great experience if the service is horrible.  My memorable evening began the moment we sat down...the water server immediately came and poured water, but it was nearly 10 minutes before a server appeared and took our order.  Having to wait that long, we thought it was wise to order appetizers and dinner....with the words to the waiter \"please do not bring the main course until  we've finished our chips and guacamole.\" Sure enough, appetizers came (guac but no chips until after we said something) and the moment we put a chip in our mouths....here comes a server with our main course.\n\nI told the server to take it back as we just got our appetizers.  I then finally flagged down our waiter to let him know what happened, to which he replied, \"I don't handle your table any more...they moved me...\" and he walks away.  Incredible.  Great Customer Service, huh?!?\n\nMoments later a young female waitress stopped by and asked if there was a problem and why we sent the meal back.  I told her what we experienced and requested fresh food (not our previous dishes that probably went back under a heat lamp) be served after we've finished with our appetizers.\n\nGranted the floor manager stopped by to apologize and comped the guacamole, we just felt rushed.\n\nAlso, be prepared to talk loud as the steady \"thump, thump, thump\" of their music system will drown out any normal conversation.\n\nOverall, the food and drinks were pricey but ok...just wish the hospitality factor was a little better."

The food was surprisingly better than we expected.  She got a vegetarian taco plate and I got a pulled pork taco plate.  \n\nMy pulled pork was not what I was expecting, but I thought it was okay.  \n\nThe service here was lacking though.  Our waiter brought us chips and salsa even though we said we didn't want any when he asked.  And then he insisted that we had ordered it.  Of course he had to take it back, and we felt a little bad but we could noticeably tell that he was annoyed at us.  \n\nHe was overly attentive though.  He kept on filing my glass of water even though the pitcher of water was on the table.  And he kept on coming by to ask us, \"do you have everything you need right now?\" often interrupting our conversation.  \n\nOn the whole I think if you're in the mood for slightly expensive Mexican food (about $15 a plate) then this place is worth checking out.  But I probably won't be back here until after I've checked out all the other places on the strip."

Most generic Mexican restaurants still get it right with somewhat decent food.  But almost everything was lousy...I will start with the food..\n\nIn what seems like an effort to be authentic of gimmicky, they bring out this bottle of water that caps off.  It looks like something they might pour your water with in a restaurant in Mexico maybe?  So it gets poured into these tiny little glasses.  The water is warm and is clearly tap water.  I'm perfectly fine with tap water at restaurants. Next time, just fill a glass up with ice and turn on the sink.  At least it will be cold, which usually helps to mask the tap flavor.  Get rid of this lame gimmick.\n\nWe got the bottomless chips and salsa.  Chips were kind of oily and super thick.  The salsas were just OK.  It all just tasted old.  \n\nThe three of us each ordered an entree.  The chicken enchiladas were dry and kind of flavorless.  They come with a side of rice and beans.  The rice tasted like the instant kind.  The fish tacos were terrible.  It all comes separate and you make your own.  The red, creamy sauce was pretty good.  But the mahi mahi was grilled so strangely in this big lump that didn't pull apart well.  It just had the flavor of burnt as well.  It's sad when I had to douse it with Tapatio to make it edible.  My girlfriend got the chicken quesadila, which actually was not bad.  But you deserve negative points if you can't make a quesadilla.  \n\nThe service was strange.  First, we had this unfriendly girl who was with us up until she took our order.  Then this creepy guy became our server, even though we kind of just thought he was a busboy until we realized the girl wasn't coming back.  He was attentive, but wayyyyy overboard.  It was like, what does he want now..\n\nOverall, this place sucks and I will never go back.  Maybe if the prices were half of what they were (well no, not then either).  But 17.99 for those nasty fish tacos and 15 for the enchiladas was ridiculous..  \n\nIf you want good Mexican food at the Fashion Show Mall, visit TacoMaker in the food court.  Their Daily Special is $5.99 and it is delicious.  Enchilada style burrito, small portion of nachos, and a crunchy taco.  Mmmmm.  I wish we had gone there instead.. :("

We went only because we had fifty dollars worth of gift certificates for the place due to a bad meal we had at its sister restaurant Stripburger a few years ago. Both restaurants are owned by a group called Lettuce Entertain You. As a result of my previous experience I wasn't going with high expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised though by my entire meal. It was much better then I had hoped for and the owners completely redeemed themselves.  El Segundo Sol is located at the Fashion Show Mall across from the Wynn. It has both indoor and outdoor patio seating. We choose to enjoy the outdoor air of Vegas. Our waiter was quick to get to the table and as Simone said he was easy on the eyes so she enjoyed his attentiveness.  We started our meal with the house made bottomless chips and salsa and a pitcher of very refreshing Sangria. Although not free like some Mexican restaurants, the chips and salsa are still excellent and worth the small price you pay. The platter includes three different types of Salsa to choose from. The most mild is the simple Pico de Gallo version of chopped onions and tomatoes, a tad spicier is the green tomatillo salsa and the last salsa is a smoky charred tomato salsa. The charred tomato was my favorite and had the most flavor but all were great especially when mixed together. We actually went through two plates full of the salsa and warm crisp chips.  For her meal Simone got the Huitlacoche Quesadilla. It was a large house made soft tortilla grilled and filled with earthy truffle mushrooms, sweet corn, Mexican spices and a creamy cheese blend.  I found it to be a bit light on the truffle flavor but Simone really enjoyed it and ate the whole thing except the few bites I stole. As is the case with almost all my mexican meals, l had to choose the Braised Pork Tacos.  The Taco's do not come assembled for you but I find that to be a lot of fun as it gives you permission to play with your food at the table and you can customize your taco to your liking.  The Pork plate comes with the generously and mildly cumin and chili spiced shredded pork with fresh cilantro leaves, a Caramelized Pineapple wedge, green chilies, Cilantro Rice, Black beans, Sour Cream and Pico de Gallo.  It is all served with those very good house made soft tortillas. I just took a little bit of everything on the plate mixed it all up and shoved it in my mouth. All the flavors matched up like the perfect marriage and exploded on your tongue like the perfect honeymoon.  It was pretty amazing and memorable.  I could have used a little bit more of it all as it was so good but it was satisfying filling.  I think this is now my second favorite Mexican place in Vegas ( Chipotle still wins the first place slot).  With or without a gift certificate, I would absolutely go back again. The prices are a little high but on par with the other places on the Vegas Strip. My faith has been restored in the Lettuce Entertain you restaurant  group. This was a great all around experience."

We stopped by for lunch before headin' out to the airport. \n\nThe hostess advised there was a 20 minute wait. Looking in the bar area we noticed several people enjoying their meal there. Noticing several tables in the bar area empty we asked if we could order from the bar and the hostess said yes but only if you sit at the bar. So we grabbed a table in the bar area and told her to keep us on the list for a table in the dining area. Within a few minutes a manager looking type came up to us, gave us water and asked if we would be ordering off the menu. We said yes and as he walked away to get our menu the hostess barreled into him and they had a brief animated exchange. He dropped off some menus and said someone would help us shortly. Ooooookay, seems like we can get service in the bar area away from the bar. Whilst perusing the menu the very affable bartender came up to our table to take our drink order. I opted for the Agave Cooler, a delightful concoction of agave nectar, fresh mint and Cruzan light rum. Ahh a refreshing and perfect cocktail for a bright, warm-ish day. H chose the house margarita on the rocks and seemed to enjoy his choice also.\n\nNot wanting to eat anything heavy I ordered the vegetable quesadillas. H wanted the crispy tacos until he found out the beef was shredded and not the ground variety. He ended up ordering the beef quesadillas which the waiter warned also had shredded beef but it was slow-braised boneless shortrib. Noting the chip and salsa was listed as an appetizer, we went ahead and ordered it (it's $2.95). The chips and salsa is a large basket that comes with 3 bowls: pico de gallo, tomatillo salsa and a red salsa. After finding we were from Texas, the server insisted on bringing us a bowl of the chef's specialty salsa. He mentioned it had some heat to it and walked away. 'Had some heat' I scoffed, 'bring it on'. I tell ya, whatever this sh*t is, it packs heat. It's a green sauce (not salsa) that they swear has no tomatillo or avocado. Apparently, it's a well guarded secret.\n\nFriendly staff, convenient location, not terribly pricey and decent food. I'll be visiting El Segundo Sol again."

Now now, before you get your panties in a bundle, I do realize it is the strip so of course things are going to be more expensive. I just cannot understand why 4 small corn tortillas, a sliced grilled chicken breast, black beans, and cilantro rice was $15. I also can't understand why their 14 oz margaritas range from $12-14. You can go anywhere on the strip and pay $10 more for a yard, and I know that because I used to work at a Mexican restaurant on the strip that sold yards of margaritas.  Basically El Segundo Sol took the place of Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. The remodel kept a lot of the elements of Ba Ba Reeba such as the wood panels, the entire bar, and various other things. What I could not understand is why they had posters and magazines decoupaged on the yellow walls of matadors from famous posters of bullfighters in Spain. Is this Mexican or Spanish with all of the leftover Ba Ba Reeba decor and the obviously off cultural elements? Spanish culture and Mexican culture, two different things. I'm digressing from the actual experience so let's get to that. \n\nSo we walk into a packed restaurant on a Saturday night. Luckily there was no wait time for the two of us, and we got sat right away. It took us a couple minutes to get greeted by an attractive waitress wearing a black guayabera unbuttoned enough so we could see her lacy black bra (hey if you got it, then get it giiiiiirl). Service was friendly but the timing was off.  It took longer than what it should of to bring our Prickly Pear Margarita and Organic Margarita to the the table. I ordered the chicken tacos since Matt already ate and in that time frame (15-20 minutes) the table in front of ours got sat, ordered food, received their food and was 5 minutes into enjoying their food before I even got my plate of tacos. I was about to ask where my comida was when the food runner brought it out. I know it was busy, I work in restaurants but it shouldn't of taken 20 minutes to bring a plate of tacos to the table. The chicken was tender and the rice and beans were good. The plate was served in a DIY style with everything laid out for you and some corn tortillas in a tin cup. No complaints on that, but it should of been around $11 not $15. We got done, saw a runner carrying flan, thought YUM and decided to split it. We got talked into ordering the tres leches cheesecake instead, which was okay. It was COVERED in cinnamon. It could of been sifted onto the dessert without using a quarter of a jar of cinnamon. Honestly, it tasted like bread pudding and  looked sort of like bread pudding. It was a circular mushy cake emulsified in a syrup and covered in cinnamon. We got a $9 discount because of Matt and the grand total came out to $38. It was $47. The price points were as such: 14 oz Pickly Pear margarita $12 14 oz organic margarita $13, chicken tacos $15, and tres leches $5. \n\nIn conclusion, the service was friendly, the ambiance was nice (albeit completely not authentic), but the prices and the timing need work. If the price points were brought down 1-2 dollars it would be more accessible to locals and more on par with what the place is, which is an Americanized Mexican fusion restaurant on the strip."

The meat in the taco was seasoned very good and came with fresh veggies but what I didn't like was the taco shell holding it together. The soft taco had no taste and it seem to be a like a thin bread dough that is still raw. At least, the street tacos were small portion because bite after bite, I didn't want to eat it anymore. \n\nWhat I thought was worth the value was the $5 Margaritas. I got it on the rocks,  but I was not crazy about type of tequila they used. The one appetizer that was delish were the quesadillas. It is made the way it is supposed to be with a crispy tortilla and mmmm melted cheese with grilled chicken. Not the best, but more satisfying than the street taco. \nThis place is conveniently located at the Fashion Show mall. This is your best bet if you want a cheap margarita and a quick bite to eat."

I was worried about being late but they sat us right away which was so nice. We ordered the guacamole for starters. It was delicious. They really do have some of the best guacamole I've ever had. I like their chips but some chips in our basket were still soft and very chewy. It kind of makes it hard to eat when they are so chewy. When we did get a crispy chip, it was awesome. My husband ordered the chile relleno and since I wasn't feeling super hungry, I just order the tamale off the appetizer menu. Presentation was nice. The food looked good. My tamales were more like a corn bread. They were crumbly and not dense like I am used to tamales being. The taste was good, I just wouldn't call what I had, a tamale. The green sauce they served with it was delicious. My husbands dish had a nice kick to it. The pepper was very good. The sauce on the plate was a little too tomato saucy for us but all in all, it was ok. I think the service here is exceptional. Our server was great. She was nice, quick  and on top of things. My husbands soda never went empty and that's good service to me. I have been more than impressed with the service at this place.

I guess we are spoiled in Texas.\n\nWe weren't that hungry so we got margaritas--$8.95--but they were very flavorful and worth it. Did not pack that much of a wallop but they were still good. We ordered appetizers only--the wife got the \"tableside\" guac and it was quite good, but not made tableside. I have no complaints and would get it again. We ordered medium but I think it could have more of a kick. I got the nachos and like most of the country except Texas they came as a pile of chips with stuff scattered here and there. They were good but nothing special. With chicken it came to $12 which is a lot for a pile of chips, of which I ate only half, the half with stuff on them. \n\nI am giving the restaurant 3.5 stars for the friendly service, the excellent margaritas, and the above average guac.

In short, we were all blown away. \n\nOur food was fresh, flavorful and unique.  Each dish we ordered had its own El Segundo Sol flair to popular Mexican dishes. It was so good that we stuffed ourselves silly. We couldn't stop! From friendly staff and excellent customer service to delicious appetizers, drinks, meals and desserts, I would highly recommend this place. \n\nThe rumor is true- this is the best Mexican food on the strip and I'm now a lifetime fan and customer. Take a gamble, grab a drink on the patio, order a few things and enjoy this hidden LV gem."

Both very good. \nService was quick.   \nMinus 1 star because the service didn't seem very genuine, but seemed rushed. \nMinus 1 more star because at the end of our meal, I asked for a refill on my water, and he completely forgot.   Forgetfulness should not be tolerated in an upscale establishment. \nMaybe next time, they will have more mindful staff."

It was very pleasant with all the LP heaters around and it was fun watching the tourists walking on the Strip.\n\nI started with a bowl of tortilla soup.  It was quite good and the service was different.  The bowl was placed on the table.  In it were tortilla strips, avocado cubes, some cilantro, queso fresco, and some pasilla chilis.  The server then poured the soup from a pitcher over the \"dry\" ingredients in the bowl.  The soup had a very nice flavor and was a good start to the meal.\n\nThe main dish was the carne asada tacos.  The server had asked how I wanted the steak cooked and it came out rare as ordered.  There were rice, beans, and the steak slices with 5 small soft tacos standing in a metal container.  The beef was good, but the rice and beans were a little bland.  Nothing a little Tapatio couldn't help!  \n\nFor dessert, I got the chocolate layer cake.  It was a circular chocolate layer cake coated in chocolate with some freshly made whipped cream.  Excellent!  You can tell from my photo that I didn't care for it at all.  I almost asked for a clean straw so I could snort the remaining crumbs.\n\nSummary:  The meal was good but it is pricey and not somewhere I'd go without some coupon.  I give it an extra 1/2 star because my server, Tiffany, was absolutely top notch.  Pleasant, friendly, and attentive are good descriptors.  After eating 4 times in the last two weeks at Lettuce Entertain You restaurants in Las Vegas, she was the only person who asked if I was a member of their frequent diners' club.  I was not but I am now thanks to her.  Her level of service kicks my rating up."

The majority of the restaurant is outside and it was a nice day, so it was a no-brainer.\n\nOur waiter extolled the virtues of the Guacamole (Del Rey Farms Avocado, Tortilla Chips, Salsa), so we ordered that and the Beef Quesadilla (Mexican Slow-Braised Beef).\n\nThe guac arrived shortly after and it was an *enormous* amount. It came in this gigantic stone bowl and was accompanied by an extremely generous helping of nachos. This is definitely one of the better variations on guacamole I've had as of late, with its big chunks of avocado and zesty seasoning. (It also contained a few pieces of what looked and tasted like orange, which seemed weird but actually worked really well.)\n\nThe quesadilla is quite tasty, too, with the rich, beefy flavor managing to come through with almost every bite. The complimentary chips and salsa were fantastic, as well.\n\n(I should note that we returned a few days later for happy hour, and the amazingly low prices aren't a reflection of the top-quality food.)"

The restaurant sits open to LV Blvd and has got a great patio with a balcony of lit trees. I loved, loved, loved the design of this place.\n\nThe chips and salsa ($2.95 for bottomless!) were DELISH.\n\nMy meal, although I just got a cheese crisp, was just OK. I had looked at getting the Fajitas but they were a bit on the pricey side ($18). \n\nThey had an extensive bar menu though and you can't really go wrong with a margarita so I would recommend this place for a drink and a snack but not sure you could count on a mind-blowing meal from El Segundo."

So I found this place, it had okay reviews so I decided to try it.\n\nThe restaurant had good ambiance. I thought we were going to be seated outside but we were sat inside which wasn't too bad. They have a huge projection screen where they were playing some channel I cannot remember. We were also next to the bar which looked to have a great selection of Tequila. \n\nI really wanted chicken flautas which they didn't have so I settled for crunchy chicken tacos. The server told us their sangrias were really good so I decided to try one of those too.\n\nThe sangria was actually pretty good, served with bits of green apple. That drink got me started for the night. \n\nThe crunchy chicken taco plate came with three tacos, black beans, white lime rice with cilantro, charred tomatillo salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. Put that all together and it made for a yummy meal. I feel the chicken could have had more flavor and also the menu stated they made their own shells but they looked more like the Taco Bell variety which I wasn't expecting. \n\nA downer to this restaurant, no free chips and salsa and the food was a bit pricey for the food. We ordered one sangria, the chicken taco plate and a ceviche appetizer. The tab was $40! Not too much bang for the buck here. Many will say that's Vegas but a different dining experience totaling the same dollar amount the next evenings makes me say I beg to differ."

What a wonderful and pleasant surprise.  First let me get it out of the way, this place is pricey, entrees are around $20 and margaritas $10 and up.  But the food quality and portions more than make up for that.  We first went with the chips and salsa, you get 3 salsas, a classic pico de gallo, a green one and a spicy red.  All were fresh and delicious and the chips are the thick homemade kind that were oh so good.  We then ordered the queso fundido (with chorizo) and that thing was huge and very good.  It includes some mini handmade corn tortillas that go well with the cheese.  My husband also ordered the tortilla soup which was hearty and tasty.  I went with the shrimp and steak fajitas as my main dish and my husband had the chicken enchiladas.  I must say I typically don't care about rice but this rice is awesome, so incredibly flavorful topped off with pico de gallo.  The margaritas we had were very good too, the big stick one was yum.  This place is decorated very nice too, it almost made me think I was in the Mayan Riviera.  I also like the private tequila dining room, very nice for a large dinner party.  This is a good option for Mexican food on the strip and I would return again."

Someone should tell this place that their rate of return on a margarita is HUGE! Too bad we only had time for 1. And yes.. we asked our server 3 times what the deal was. The tacos I had this time around were mediocre. I got the steak ones and they were too chewy.. it was hard to eat them. The meat was charred on the outside and completely raw in the middle.

The 3 salsas that came with the chips were OK but not very fresh tasting... but ill give it to you though that it's probably hard to make good pico de gallo in January.\n\nPork tacos were also good but did not particularly impress. \n\nFor those price inelastic folks out there though, the ambiance of the place is great: they have a nice indoor and outdoor bar, a TON of tequilas, and there is an upscale but still laid-back feel to it. So if you don't mind paying $40 for a meal you could get off the strip for $12, then by all means give it a try."

The hostess was kind enough to put us in tables more towards the back of the restaurant, so we could have room for our daughter's stroller. \n\nWe of course got the chips and salsa. Mango margarita, prickly pear margarita and a beer. Our friend with the mango margarita has a fresh slice of mango in his, which he devoured along with the drink. My prickly pear was almost too perfectly delicious.\n\nOur waitress was so kind. Complete 180 of most of the servers that we have had when eating here. She went through the specials, with great description, and was patient and kind enough to re-explain things when we couldn't hear or didn't understand. \n\nMy guy ordered the enchilada special, that came with one chicken and one beef enchilada. Our friend and I both ordered the mahi mahi tacos. We asked for more green and red salsa, because they kind of skimp when they fill up their little black bowls. The pico was a little lack luster, but our 18 month old gladly ate the tomatoes and snacked on the chips....The man that dropped off our food quickly returned with generous amounts of the green and red salsa..\n\nOur food came out, and to tell you the truth, we were all kind of shocked....in a good way.\n\nUsually, when I have ordered their fish tacos, the fish has came out already sectioned out in individual tacos...and the flavor of the fish has been lack luster. \n\nThis time, a grilled filet of fish comes out, with about 4 or 5 tortillas to section and make your own. We were blown away how wonderful everything tasted. Everything, was just perfect....even the black beans and rice. All three of us were clean platers. \n\nWe ordered another round of drinks...which did take a while to come out. \n\nAfter asking for the check, that did take a while too.... Like at least 15 minutes for her to come back with out change."

We have continually brought friends and recommended this restaurant. Recently we took a friend to El Segundo only to discover that the three items that make a restaurant successful were now missing. I am referring to \"Service, Food quality and Price\". All three seem to have disappeared since our last visit. The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived for their \"Happy Hour\" yet service was slow. We ordered their happy hour steak tacos and after a long wait they arrived. The few pieces of tasteless grizzly steak the size of a half cube of sugar we're on the most minuscule taco we have ever seen. Prices on their once reasonable menu have been raised to those of a gourmet restaurant. We will not be returning to El Segundo Sol again."

I celebrated my birthday there with 25 people, and not only would we never go back, but we would never recommend it to anyone again, especially groups. The food was great, but the service was so bad, and the management's failure to take any responsibility at all makes this a 1-star maximum experience.\n\nWe arrived at 6:45, and almost immediately noticed that the waitress servicing our tables was woefully understaffed (she was servicing at least 6 large groups). It took 15-20 minutes just for chips and guacamole to come out, forgetting about any drinks. When we arrived, I let the waitress know that it was critical that we were out of the restaurant by 8:15 - we had an event immediately afterwards (and this is mexican food - an hour and a half is reasonable). Additionally, I let her know to take the food orders first, because that typically takes the longest.\n\nWe placed our food order at 7PM, followed shortly after by drink orders. The drinks took a half hour to 40 minutes to come out (multiple drinks were delivered to the wrong people) - I finally had to follow up with the hostess and ask what was going on, because I couldn't even find the waitress. I'm sorry, but 40 minutes to get a ginger ale doesn't fly with me - it's inexcusable. \n\nAt 7:45 I asked her to process the checks for all tables (we had 5 tables, so 5 checks) so we can make sure we are out for 8:15. At 7:50, I'm really getting nervous - not one plate of food has come out. The first plate didn't arrive till 8:05, and it took another 40 MINUTES for them to bring out the last check. The last portion of the group wasn't out until 8:50 - over a half hour late to our next event causing us precious time.\n\nThe worst part of the whole experience was that the manager refused to comp or acknowledge anything was wrong. I asked multiple times to speak to the general manager and the hostess and waitress flat out refused. The restaurant offered a meek apology and blamed the kitchen, when it was clearly not their fault (especially for drink orders).\n\nLong story short, if you're in a big group, avoid this place like the plague."

Excellent to just sit outside, people watch, and soak up the hustle n' bustle of the Vegas Strip.\n\nAnd now for the food, service, and atmosphere: not as good as I hoped.  First of all the food itself was just mediocre; just a notch higher than the other Americanized Mexican fare.  The price was incredibly expensive for what I deemed as simple Mexican dishes.  I had the grilled chicken tostada and it resembled two small rice bowls with just enough fillers to make it look full.  There was a fair amount of chopped chicken breast meat but it was pretty bland.  Price for this dish cost $14.99.\n\nOkay I understand that the restaurant is in prime location but paying that kind of price for food that's one notch up from Acapulco's wasn't exactly what I had in mind.  Plus there was no complementary chips n' salsa like any other Mexican restaurants that I've been to.  If you want table-side chips n' salsa, you would have to pay for that.\n\nService was just okay but not overall attentive.  When we entered the restaurant, there was not host/hostess at the front.  A bunch of us milled around for a bit until the hostess finally noticed that we were waiting to be seated.  Our server did take our order after nearly 10 minutes of waiting and only checked on us once during our meal and that was not including bringing us our bill.\n\nThe atmosphere can't be beat.  The location was amazing and you have your choice of whether to sit inside or at the outside patio (which I highly recommend).  It was nicely decorated with a fiesta-like ambiance.\n\nOther than that, I'm pretty sure there are better choices for a quick bite."

She asked if we wanted to sit at the high tops which feature all day happy hour on Sundays, lucky for us that it was Sunday. The happy hour deals, however, weren't much to write home about. Let's see, $5 margaritas, $2.99 tequila shots, and a few apps. You can also get a few domestic tall boys for $5 and a few imports for $6. Those seem like the best deal to me. \n\nFor apps we had the spicy table side guac. I'm not really a fan of guac but this was pretty good, although expensive, $9 maybe. We also had the roasted peppers, I probably wouldn't order that again. The chips and salsa were good, although I would generally say that I enjoy any chips and salsa. \n\nI had the shredded pork tacos. They were good but nothing remarkable. GF had the shrimp fajitas. For $19.99 I thought there might be more than 5 flippin shrimp but it was good. \n\nFor dessert we had the flan, tres leches cake and the chocolate cake. I thought the tres leches was the best and the chocolate cake was only so so. However, when dipped into the tres leches sauce, the chocolate cake was much better! \n\nOur waitress was decent and didn't try to rush us out of there even though we stayed at least three hours. \n\nWith so many other options in Vegas I probably won't return to El Segundo Sol, especially with Ra right next door."

I'm always craving tacos from the taqueria.  typically the strip I stay away from especially Mexican food. It's typically a Tex-mex, which I have learned to not like through the years. But this place gives me hope.  located right on LV Blvd. in front of he fashion show mall, it's a great location and I LOVE decor. Let me tell you about our server Bodi, absolutely awesome.\n\nWe have used the travelzoo deal (which is perfect) this time we purchased it but it was usable due to date. (Our fault) We decided to stay anyways. Ordered the Mango frozen margarita, Bloody Mary, and chips and guacamole. The chips are literally right out of the frier which I love they are warm, thick, and crispy. And they make the gauc right there! So spicy and flavor packed! I loved it. Next we split the mahi fajitas, it came out with amazing flavor, warm tortillas, and cilantro lime rice that is PHENOMENAL.  Plus our server was awesome, very nice, not to over bearing, and I had asked him to give me a try at his favorite margarita. (I always love knowing what the servers like! They are around it all the time!) \nIf you like tequila then this marg is perfect. Jam packed with tequila, perfection. \n\nAll in all great time, food, and view was perfect for people watching.

I have gone to eat here several times, mostly for happy hour, and have only been just a little bit disappointed. Just a smidge.\n\nHappy Hour: Truly one of the best on the strip. GREAT food selection (go straight to the chicken, pork or beef tacos, DO NOT PASS GO), margaritas are delicious, not too sweet, not bland or watered down with mix. Service is good each time we go to El Segundo. We love the nachos, not too much cheese, love the jalepenos for that extra kick without being too aggressive. GET THE CRAB TOSTADA. REAL crab, not heavy on the mayo or dressing, PERFECT. YUM. NOW. HH gives you food in the perrfect size. It is a great HH, and perfect for a few quick bites to refuel while running amock on the strip.\n\nInside Restaurant: Now here is where my desire to give only three stars comes into play. Since I was so used to the delicious street tacos and nacos and oh yes, that crab tostada I was a little displeased with the restaurant fare. I strongly dislike, borderline HATE overcooked food. I've done it before, but that was in the privacy of my own home and rarely at a restaurant. The shrimp was VERY overcooked. Disappointed, especially since the shrimp were plump and looked delicious sitting on the fajita plate. Maybe it sat for too long? Heat lamp cooking? I got my way through it by smothering the shrimp with their DELICIOUS cilantro rice (seriously, I could have eaten a copious amount of that rice) and beans. However, the next time I came back and had the chicken tacos? SAME THING. DRY. Oh, I just don't think that dry chicken should ever be served to a table. If someone could say the food on their plate is dry, DO NOT SERVE IT. Even by looking at it I could see that it was dry.\n\nHowever, between their killer happy hour and their AMAZING AMAZING AMAZINGA tableside guacamole, I'm confident in the 4 stars here. Go for HH, get some guacamole, chips and salsa, nachos with chicken, crab tostada and some street tacos and you'll be good to go until later that night when you're struggling to hold down the contents of your stomach after one too many Hurricanes."

The glass walls allowed for a perfect view of the strip. The wait staff was awesome as well. Quick to take drink and food orders. I had the tortilla soup which was delicious. Even had a little flair, as the waiter placed a bowl of the \"dry\" ingredients in front of me. Then poured the soup from a separate pitcher into the bowl. Most of the girls ordered tacos, and everyone was pleased with their meal. I was pretty stoked that they sold tall cans of beer, so that's what I had for drinks. Others in our party ordered margaritas and said they were good and strong.

(late for us is 9:00; we usually eat at 5!)  \n\nWe got a table in front of the patio.  A very friendly waitress came over promptly to take our drink order. I had a michelada in the big 32 oz. cup. K'ayum asked for a suicide (all soft drinks mixed together) and they were happy to oblige. Adriana had a prickly pear margarita. She said it was great.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the queso fundido and the grilled peppers. K'ayum ordered chicken taquitos. The queso fundido blew us away - it was amazing! It came with chips and hand-made tortillas. The grilled peppers were interesting - a plate of green peppers (and one red one) with lime and salt. They were quite tasty and not too spicy, until we got to the red one. There should be a warning label on it!  \n\nK'ayum wasn't too happy with the taquitos because they had cheese inside, so we helped him - amazing!  And from the kid's menu! \n\nThe waitress came by to check on us, and we decided we were too full to order anything else. I asked for the tequila list, and she recommended one of my favorite a\u00f1ejos - Reserva de la Familia - but I opted for Clase Azul (the reposado - I've only seen the a\u00f1ejo at one bar)  (Javier's at the Aria - $200 a shot...)\n\nAlthough the food and service were both great, it was the michelada that did it for me. I came back the next morning at opening right before leaving for the airport to have one more at the bar, to see how it's made.  They put the usual: clamato, lime, pepper, worcestershire sauce - the big difference as far as I could see was cayenne pepper! So I've been making them that way at home ever since - and using my Segundo Sol cup (you get to keep the 32 oz. one...) to pretend that I'm still there!"

I was full just with that. They had 3 different salsas - salsa Verde, roasted salsa, pico De gallao which was really salty and mixing it with the other salsas made it edible.\n\nThe steak taco is a good choice at almost $20 a plate but it was a good amount of meat, rice and beans. The chicken quesadilla was small but good enough for 1 if you pigged out on the chips. Also got a side if elite which was really roasted with cheese, chili, and lime. Good but not cooked enough for me."

I stuck with beer, but my BF tried their margaritas. They were good! This is definitely one of my top places to go for HH. I love places with a good vibe, clean, and easy!\n\nDINNER - made reservations the day of for a party of 11. When we got there, they had given us the private room! Yay! Our waitress was ah-maz-ing! She divided our check so each person's order was sub-totaled; fantastic when you are dealing with people who have been drinking for the past two hours. I only got their version of the garden salad because I filled up on chips and drinks! The salad was very tasty though, and used quality ingredients. Everyone was very satisfied with their food - those that got the house rice were especially raving about its taste. My GF order \"The Big Stick\" in 32oz. Huge, pretty, and yummy if sugary drinks are your thing. Definitely fun to look at though!\n\nDuring both visits, all employees were attentive and helpful. The prices are very reasonable, and the serving sizes are perfect so you don't have to worry about being too stuffed to fit into your club gear!"

The manager mark came to help bring out the drinks after we went to the bar to try to get our own drinks since our server Maddie wasn't bringing them out. We quickly cancelled our order because this service was horrible. Maddie did not try to rectify the situation at all.

The only reasoning with the two stars was because the food was delicious. Our server was the worst, not sure if she had a bad day or what but Debanjal could not be less concerned with doing her job. We watched as two other servers checked on and delivered drinks, food and pleasantries. We almost asked to switch servers. She delivered a round of drinks and stopped once to see if our appetizer was fine and then to collect our finished main dishes- commenting on how much we had eaten. While dropping off the check she never thanked us, Another server said thanks and goodbye instead. The reason for the harsh review is that both my boyfriend and I are in the service industry and couldn't believe how bad the service we received from her was. I could elaborate further but the bottom line was she ruined the dining experience. Hopefully she is retrained."

The asada was \"ok\" but the tacos still sucked.  Onions, and perhaps a little cheese to put on them would have been nice.  Salsa?  Well, you have to dip into the salsa for the chips for that.  I tasted the rice and beans, but didn't bother with either beyond that.  The words \"tourist trap\" come to mind."

I must say I did like the upscale Mexican cantina decor and there was plenty to see and great music.  I went here for dinner with a friend and we both agreed it would make a nice date spot or even pre-dinner place before partying on the strip.  \n\nI loved the chips which were freshly baked corn tortillas with an excellent sampling of salsas.  I ordered Ceviche as an appetizer which is completely unnecessary since you probably will fill up on all the addictive chips.  I had to ask for them to placed out of arms reach to avoid devouring too many. For my entree I had the tequila salmon  which came with jasmine rich that was both sticky and sweet.  The salmon was filling and tasty but not overly flavorful as what I suspected since it came out on a \"hot plate\".\n\nThe service and attention provided by the staff is certainly top notch and it ended up being a fun and enjoyable dinner.  If you're looking for something different and not too pricey on the strip this is a great place."

The home-made guacamole was good and they kept refilling chips so that's a plus! I tried their special zucchini Sweet Corn Quesadilla- the server said it was spicy but I like spicy so I went with that. Although they were not super busy or crowded it did take a little bit for us to get our food. I tried the quesadilla and it was not spicy BUT scorching(spicy) HOTTTT.. I told our server and she had them make me another one (which was nice) without the peppers.( and without giving any dirty looks)  She failed to tell me the were \"fresno red chili peppers\" which are among the spiciest they serve in the restaurant -___- Okay well lesson learned. I think it would've been nice if she mentioned that prior but she took care of it and I cant complain. Overall good food and drinks!"

The chips and salsa were plentiful and served with charred tomato salsa, roasted tomatillo salsa and pico de gallo. The margarita's were a little on the sweet side but refreshing.\nOur choice of entrees were the grilled Chicken Tacos served with cilantro rice, black beans, pico de gallo, sour cream and large corn or flour tortillas. The dish could be improved as the chicken was overcooked and dry. \nThe grilled Achiote Shrimp is made with a serrano and garlic marinade. This fajita platter is served with grilled bell peppers, onions, corn on the cobb and asparagus along with cilantro rice, black beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, salsa and warm tortillas, mini corn or flour. As with the chicken the shrimp was cooked too long and dry. Overall the food was plentiful and service was great. I would award 4 stars if the chicken and shrimp were not overcooked."

My partner and I wanted to refuel and relax before heading out to gamble on the strip, and the cute outdoor patio seemed like the right spot to chill. Loved the music they play (lots of reggaeton and salsa), as well as the twinkling lights.\n\nWhen we arrived, the front patio area was pretty full, but the back part was empty. Our server was courteous, and took our drink orders fairly promptly. We also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa.  A few minutes later, our server came back to let us know the wine I'd ordered was only available by the bottle, not by the glass. (I thought that was odd, since it was clearly on the menu as one of the wines available by the glass. Maybe update your menus to avoid confusion...). But cool, ordered a different wine. \n\nWe waited at least 15 minutes for our chips and salsa appetizer. It arrived right before the entrees.  That was irritating, as we were hungry, and what's the point of bottomless chips (not free btw) if they give them to you right before your meal?  The chips and salsa were actually quite tasty. \n\nThe Mexican chopped salad I ordered was not great. It was basically a cold garden salad with a few pieces of corn and beans and dry chicken. My partner's tacos weren't bad, a little salty, but decent overall. \n\nI ordered a second glass of wine that never arrived, so I eventually canceled it before getting the check. Overall, the service was ill timed and distracted, though our server was very polite.  \n\nWould I return? Yes, but probably for happy hour or to grab light appetizers and a drink on the patio.  For a full meal, probably not."

Walked in and made my way to the bar where 3 bartenders were working.  I ordered the cucumber mint margarita which was very good and seemed to have a salted rim with a hint of cumin.  I usually hate cumin but this accentuated the flavor of the cocktail.  I looked at the food menu while I waited for my little lady to arrive.  She ordered the red sangria which tasted really watered down.  We found the queso fundido & two different ceviches that peaked our interest.  One bartender left on break leaving the other two tenders to service the 8 people surrounding them.  The two bartenders couldn't find the time to take our order, or ask if we needed new cocktails for our empty glasses.  I would be more compassionate if the dining room was packed or the bar was a zoo.    Over 10 minutes passed while we treaded water with empty glasses and hungry bellies.  Cant judge the food if we dont get a chance to order but the service was horrible! I didn't feel I had to beg for ordering food and drinks so we left $ on the bar for the cocktails we had.  Who knows if it was enough to cover the tab because we didn't even get a check.

            "review": "Ok, 4 stars, WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE.  \n\nLook, I was a huge fan of Cafe Ba Ba Reeba (or, El Primero, for those of us who listened to our 4th grade Spanish teachers).  As a part-time local I would GO TO THE STRIP to sit out on Ba Ba Reeba's patio (not something locals tend to do -- I just liked it that much!)\n\nI adore the new digs -- love the trees, love the lights, a bit loud for me, but, overall a wonderful improvement.  However, I think the location could have been equally successful with all that AND had they kept the cool tapas, paella and sangria they once served.  Not the best move for \"Lettuce Entertain You\".\n\nThat said, the margaritas just might be the best on the strip.  I ordered the veggie tacos and my husband had the jumbo shrimp fajitas.  Both were VERY good; since neither were dripping in oil we felt healthy and full all at the same time.\n\nSadly, unless I'm in that location and desperate for Mexican food (and, trust me, you got TONS of Mexican food and margarita choices on the strip) I won't go back.  It just wasn't unique enough to get a local to drive to the strip to go there. \n\nI'd rather have a burger at Strip Burger right next door.  Which, I guess, means \"Lettuce Entertain You\" wins anyway.\n\nMust have been the point..."

I was not the hugest fan of Reeba but was going to eat there for a change...and this was here instead. It was really nice, the food was excellent.The five stars I gave it  has nothing to do with service, which was great, or food, which was amazing, but I gave 5 starts for the awesome bottle of water they give you to share with the table and the awesome handblown loook of glasses that took everything inme not to steal it. The outdoor seating was very cute with a tree canopy with lights kinda romantic in a casual way, the sangria was waaay too good which also helps that romance, and the prices were reasonable for the service and awesomeness of the food. I mean, I wasn't paying anyway, but the very handsome man I was with didn't complain ha ha. As much as I normally hate the strip and avoid it for all reasons, I will side step my contempt for this place any day!!"

I'm giving it 4 stars though it does have some pros and cons. \n\nPROS: \n* It's a cool place, sort of a hectic vibe, and loud, but cool just the same \n* The margaritas are *$%#-ing amazing! You will want more than one, so just get the 32 oz up front.  I got 1 strawberry and 1 mango, both awesome.\n* The guacamole is also stellar, a large portion and really good! \n*The food is good, not out of this world like the guac and margaritas but definitely good \n*I heard from another vegetarian that the veggie tacos, which is more like fajitas than tacos are super awesome. The best she said, EVER. \n\nCONS: \n* Chips and salsa are not complimentary, they cost 2.75 \n* The service is SLLLOOOOW, it's busy so be prepared to wait. We waited over 45 mins for food at 8pm on a Sunday.\n* My friend got the beef quesadilla, which was beef, cheese and jalapenos (WAY too spicy for her, she couldn't eat it) \n*It's fairly pricey, the large margarita is 21 or 22 bones. \n*LOUD, if you want a quiet place, this is not for you. \n*No burritos here, if you like burritos don't bother, they have zero \n\nAll in all if you have the cash to spend and you're looking for a fun, upbeat vibe this would be perfect for you. It's on the strip, at the Fashion Show mall, easy walking distance from a lot of hotels. If you're in a small group and get the chips. salsa and quac I would suggest getting only apps.  The tacos look like a LOT of food, I could only eat part of the quesadilla after the guac.   I will definitely come back again when I don't have a time restraint."

We went twice in one weekend, first for a late night snack and again the next day for happy hour, because I am in love with their charred tomato salsa, sooo good! The chips are great too, oh and did I mention the chips and salsa is bottomless? Not just during happy hour either, and for $2.95 its a great deal. I can't speak for any other food, but everything that came out of the kitchen looked great. We also had great service from the bartenders both visits.\n\nWe probably wouldn't have tried this place if we weren't staying at the Wynn since its right across the street from it (on the edge of Fashion Show mall), but I'm so glad we did.

But, I didn't listen to my own advice and stopped by this place, located on the ground floor of Fashion Show mall, across from the Wynn.\n\nThere's a bar and patio street side for people watching and a darker, more cozy dining area inside. The food was slightly better than expected, but with the same hefty price tag of our casual Strip eateries. The freshly made guacamole was perfectly seasoned and well balanced with just enough acidity. The freshly fried tortillas chips were a welcome bonus, too. The pork taco platter consisted of succulent chunks of pork (that were too oily for their own good) in a skillet and some accompanying ingredients next to it for you to build your own tacos. The five tortillas they give you are plenty. The rice and beans were nothing special. But, you can basically say that about the majority of Mexican restaurants in town.\n\nThere's a kid's menu with typical kid-friendly fare. I will say that their cheese quesadilla was excellent. I'm not sure how they get their tortillas to be so delicate and crispy (almost like wonton wrappers) but they make for some of the best quesadillas a kid will eat. And, my kid is an expert at eating them.\n\nAs long as you go in knowing you'll spend a lot, you will probably leave satisfied. The food is typical Mexican that doesn't break any new ground, but is good enough to hold it's own against similar Mexican spots on the Strip.\n\n3.5 Stars"

I had a margarita with Don Julio Reposado, and it was exactly what I expected. They offer tableside guacamole (which really is just an expensive way of proving your guac didn't come from a Sysco container). The guac was good, but not spectacular. Chips were fresh, but not hot. I admit I am a snob when it comes to tortilla chips. The salsa options were all pretty bland.\n\nMy entree was forgettable. But my wife's tacos were really good. So I guess those are hit or miss.

Shortly after we started digging in, the manager (with a little earpiece wire) came by our table to check how things were.  We said GREAT so far!

The manager swung back around and apologized about what happened and said he's going to take off the apps from our bill!!!!!!!!!!!  We didn't even complain and they took care of $20 off our bill, even though they really didn't have to!!!  They really cared about our experience!\nThen Alfonso was walking by as my colleague said, \"I'm cold!

Grilled vegetables were yummy.  Liked that it wasn't just the typical mix of bell peppers and onions.  They also included grilled asparagus.  I give it an A-.\n\nService:  D\nSLOW!

We enjoyed the ahi tuna and the shrimp & avocado appetizers. The wait staff is not always the best but we love the food so much we don't care. Not to mention that after a few cocktails nothing bothers us much anyways. :) I've never been disappointed here. Yumm!! Try it!!"

(downside - the water wasnt cold).\n\nanyway...we ordered a pitcher of their white sangria, 2 of each taco and chips and salsa. after we ordered we noticed their guacamole bar (they make guacamole fresh to order, and to your degree of spicy). it was a little too late to order since we already got chips and salsa.\n\ncoming from LA, i thought the tacos were ok. very tasty, but not the kind of \"street tacos\" im used to. the salsas were all really good, and the sangria was pretty tasty. keep in mind they are street tacos. we ended up ordering another round of tacos.\n\ni like that they have a bar area, dining area, and \"street taco\" stand. definitely a place i enjoyed, and will probably go back to. definitely curious about their fajitas (we overheard one of the servers telling their guests that the fajitas are their house specialty, along with the guacamole, and the order is big enough to share).\n\nservice wasnt that great, although it was happy hour and lets be honest - happy hour service isnt always perfect. all in all, a great experience, and perfect for a quick bite before a show."

The Big Stick and the Sol margaritas were deliciously strong and my go-to. The happy hour bar menu is also awesome with a variations of Mexican dishes at a really great price. I enjoyed the quesadillas the most- and do you wanna know why?! Because they came with guac, pico de gallo and sour cream, and the pico de gallo was actually DELICIOUS. We also tried the fish and lobster tacos. I'm a fan of the fish although my friend preferred the lobster. I also really loved the bar tender whose name I didn't manage to get but she's a really kind lady with long blonde hair. Very attentive and polite.

This past visit we went with kids and say at the normal tables, the service was terribly slow, but maybe that's just because we had children. \nThen they ran out of the beer I ordered , apparently I \"was confused \" by the waiter on the price when he offered me another selection, as he told me multiple times when I asked about the bill. That's why I took off a star, the way in which I was spoken to, and then another star for the speed of service and our MIA waiter.

The steak was marinated and cooked nicely but it was a very spartan taco with nothing else going on but some slices of steak and some small corn tortillas standing up in a metal cylinder, with rice and beans.

We ordered the bottomless nachos to begin and they were fresh (and I mean, the nachos themselves were hot, fresh and just made!), delicious and huge! With just the right amount of everything.  They were accompanied with 3 different salsas and we loved each one. We then ordered fajitas (1 steak entree and 1 chicken entree) and they too, were fresh, delicious and great sized portions. I didn't try any cocktails here, but my fiance was happy with the tap IPA beer the waiter recommended.  I found myself craving it again the next day while sitting at the pool, but knew I couldn't indulge in nachos again haha.  The service was a bit slower than expected, considering the place was actually pretty dead.

The fact this place shares a kitchen with Stripburger also did not make me excited about this place.  But frankly, in the end, we were pleasantly surprised by the decent quality of the food here.\n\nAfter two visits, we have tried their steak fajitas, two types of fish tacos, carnitas tacos, a salad and their bottomless chips/salsa. \n\nThe bottomless tray of hot chips ($2.95) were nice...but nothing outstanding. Depending on the time we went, the pico de gallo could taste a little over marinated (lunch was better than dinner). The roasted tomato and the salsa verde were both only okay in my books - really lacking that nice subtle heat and flavour of a really fresh salsa. Given the timing of the main entrees (which tends to take a while), this order can be a godsend if you're hungry.\n\nThe carnitas ($14.95) and fish tacos were pretty solid renditions. The carnitas were slightly sweet, smoky and lightly dressed. Combined with the beans, it was a nice combination. The fish taco were good in both the fried ($15.95) and grilled ($17.95)  rendition. (Of note: the grilled version was not dry which is hard to find but the serving size is smaller than the fried version) The accompanying cilantro rice is definitely on the drier side I would probably pass on those carbs.\n\nI would have to unfortunately comment that the fajitas are a monumental fail. The cast iron skillet that it was served upon scorched the poor veggies into oblivion. As they say, \"no es bueno\".\n\nThe chipotle Caesar salad ($5.95) was also disappointing. The creamy chipotle dressing was too heavy, overly smoky and needed much more acidity. It's seemed also a rather poor portion size with scant condiments given that you're paying $6 for it. I kind of expected more pumpkin seeds than I can count on one hand. So pass on this one too. \n\nThe tres leches is only okay in my books. It comes literally swimming in a large bowl of milk = soggy cake. If they toned down the milk significantly, the texture would definitely benefit a lot.\n\nService can be really hit or miss depending on the time you go and on the server you get. We've had some really good servers but some really slow ones as well. Lunch and weekdays (of course!) are the better times to hit this place.\n\nFYI - I would probably skip the tableside gucamole. Watching the gucamole station made me leery because 1) how can it be good when some random person is making the gucamole, 2) the person making it isn't tasting it to make sure it tastes good and 3) there is no handwashing station close by. You have been warned!!!\n\nOverall for the Strip, this place is not bad but it isn't great either. If you are a Lettuce Entertain You Member and get coupons in the mail, it can an affordable place. 3 starred review."

El Segundo Sol is located at the front of the Fashion Show Mall next to RA Sushi.\n\nWhen we first walked it, there was a sign in the front to text a number to obtain drink and food specials. It is a scam to sign up for regular spam texts pertaining to this restaurant. We thought by texting that it would give us some sort of a discount. They should be upfront up with this instead of misleading the public.\n\nThey sat us in a booth but the service was really slow. It took them a long time to get to our table to order our food, bring out our food, and especially bring out our check. It wasn't really that busy so I wonder why they were so slow. I thought my chicken fajita platter was pretty good but overall I wasn't really impressed with the restaurant due to its service and ambiance."

Start off with an awesome margarita, I loved the blackberry! Try (and this won't be easy) to not gorge yourself on the chips and guacamole, not to mention that the salsa is pretty dang good too and the chips are hot, crispy and corny. If you have not filled yourself to the brim with guac I recommend the sweet corn tamales.  I have been looking for some of these tasty little gems for a couple of years now since my favorite place closed and these come as close as I have had. These are just stinking good.

The busboy made sure our table was clear of any dirty dishes and the manager came by a couple to times to check on us.  Everyone was happy with their food.  They had a special that included a cheese enchilada, chicken tostada and fish taco with rice and beans.  Even though we were originally craving some pasta, this was a true blessing in disguise.

Decent to good service and very good food. Love the hand made guacamole and the tamales. The rest of the menu has great merit. Elote is a good deal for $3. Good selection of tequila includes a double barrel reposado that Herraduro did just for the chef. $13 a shot or $200 for a bottle. If you're local you can leave your dedicated bottle at the bar for your convenience. Your key chain identified you as the bottle owner when you stop in. It is a very good tequila, aroma has definite tones of whisky and tobacco. Smooth, sherry like taste upfront with a pronounced but smooth tequila backbone"

That was a great score as there were many restaurants to choose from.  In fact, the list was so plentiful I had to have the guy help me pare it down.  \n\nWe selected one for El Segundo Sol, which is located in the Fashion Place Mall.  Since we were staying right across the street from there, it seemed like an obvious choice.   We had a $25 off coupon if you spend $35 or more, which isn't too hard to do in a Vegas restaurant.  It didn't restrict drinks either, which so many do.  So, we ended up spending close to $60 but then the coupon came into play and it was around $40, so not a bad deal.\n\nThe food was tasty Americanized Mexican food.  That's not a complaint at all, merely, an observation.  It was very tasty and there was plenty of it.  In fact, we got a to go box to take it back to our hotel room, there was so much of it.  We got the daily special and it was three different types of chicken dishes, a tostada, taco, and an enchilada, all very tasty. \n\nWe ordered guacamole to go with our chips and asked for the spicy, which it was and very good.  Their chips and salsa come with three types of salsas and they have no problems giving you more should you desire that.  \n\nI had a margarita with specialty tequila and it was about $9 but very good.  I only needed one.  The guy had a couple of beers which he said were also good.\n\nThe staff was very helpful and never let us run out of anything and they had a bottle of water on the table that you could refill your own water glass which I like because most places don't come back as often as I would like with the water.\n\nAt one point, the manager, Josh, I think he said his name was, came over to see how we were doing.  It was nice to be checked in on.\n\n It was about 4:30PM on a Friday afternoon and the bar was full but there were just a few of us at the tables in the dining area.  I'm sure they were soon to get more crowded as the time went on.\n\nThis was a fun place, with great service. \n\nWe didn't want for a thing and I would definitely be back to try it again when I'm on that end of the strip."

So, the previous night a few of us went to STK and the service that Gloria provided was by far above and beyond what we had experienced the night before.  She was attentive, colorful and made an AWESOME guacamole.  Having owned several restaurants coast to coast you get a good feel of what people can turn into and she definitely will be in a management role the way she is going.  If you end up at El Segundo please ask for her, to guarantee, that you will receive top notch service.  \nAs for the food, well, there's some need for improvement.  I understand that this a chain on the strip, and everything is measured, but when I order TACOS I want my meat over flowing.  I don't want some anorexic looking taco! I had three different types and I wouldn't order them again. Don't get me wrong, they had good flavor, but don't be cheap with the meat.\nDrinks were priced competitively, $5 Shots of Cazadores, $3 beers and I forget the rest because I had one too many shots! Anyhow, I thought it was a nice gesture that Gloria introduced us to the General Manager who in turn bought us a round of shots.  Usually, its the girls who get the FREE drinks, so we were happy that we finally got a hook up! The pour cost for the 3 shots is probably 70-90 cents each, so even though they ended up losing $2.70 at most, because of their generosity we will definitely be back to spend some more $$$ the next time we are in Vegas.  \nGreat service, great happy hour special!!"

After being thirsty for an hour of mall walking i know he wanted some nice, cold water. he was pleased they had one of his favorite beers though, modelo especial. i ordered a frozen prickly pear margarita ($4.95) while Dan T. ordered his beer. Another 10 minutes went by before we got our drinks. Dan enjoyed his beer and my margarita was refreshing. A little too sweet but it is the first margarita i have had in months so i shouldn't complain. i recommend the prickly pear to the ladies and gents who prefer to not taste their alcohol. i had no idea i was getting anything. about another 10 - 15 minutes passed before we got our nachos. they didn't warn us the plate was burning hot so my hand almost melted when i touched it grabbing some nachos. OW! they weren't bad. i wish the bottom part didn't consist of 8 nachos turned one because of melted cheese. the guacamole and tomatos were not spread out, but one of each on the side. weird. i do wish they were all over and messy though. it mostly consisted of melted cheese and chicken. the meat wasn't bad, but it should have had a little more flavor to it.\nI don't know if i will be back. wasn't awful and disgusting, but nothing really made me say wow between the drink and the nachos. it was sunday from 4 to 5pm and the place wasn't packed at all so the fact that nobody came by for a while at first annoyed me. i had such better hopes for this place. oh well. i'll stick to dos caminos if i am over in the area."

My favorites so far are the Mango, The Big Stick and the Two tone sangria (frozen margarita with a sangria float...mmmmm. You can actually taste the flavor of the tequila instead of a margarita syrup slushy that you get along the strip! :)\nThe last time we went in we ordered the guacamole which is Deeeelicious! It came out with warm chips and a yummy salsa! The beautiful guacamole girls let my children join in on the fun of making the guac for our table which they really enjoyed participating in. :)\nAs for appetizers, go for the chicken taquitos and the cheese fundido. The chicken taquitos are wrapped with butter lettuce, jicama, and a red chile pepper. SooOooo good! The cheese fundido my kids tore up in seconds! They made mini cheese burritos with the warm corn tortillas that were brought out with them. \n\nNow, onto dinner. I got the Baja fish tacos that were lightly battered mahi mahi strips. It was a dyi taco platter which was wonderful for my picky kids. The tacos are served with a side of  cilantro rice (that was perfectly cooked btw....not overcooked like most Mexican resturants) and black beans, that were fabulous ! My friend that came along with us ordered the shrimp fajitas. OMG! The shrimp fajita platter is massive....it comes with jumbo marinated shrimp, warm flour tortillas, cilantro rice, black beans, yummy grilled veggies n sides of sour cream and salsa. \n\nBy the time everyone was finished our waitress somehow persuaded us to get dessert. My girlfriend n I  ordered the coconut flan and the kiddies all ordered the paletas (Popsicles). The flan was light and creamy and devoured by all of us. The children ordered the mango and coconut popcicles. These popcicles you can tell are freshly made at the resturant with fresh fruit pur\u00e9es and chunks of fresh fruit. The kids loved them! So yummy! \n\nWe had a wonderful experience here! Oh ya, and If you can get your eyes off of your food....look around at the staff....I will say, they've got a very good looking staff! \n\nAnyhow, thank you lettuce entertain you for yet another wonderful place to eat in las vegas! :) I'll be back!"

Shrimp were bland, chicken was dry, and beef was not skirt steak as advertised and chewy and tasteless, though it was medium rare as requested. Tortillas had that nasty smell that the ones that come in a plastic bag have.  And I am a local.\n\nJust found out that they have coupons on restaurant.com.  Wouldn't have helped taste of food but would have made it easier to swallow since there were four of us."

While we were waiting for the food to arrived, my friend noticed a bird flying around the restaurant! Apparently this happens every so often. Okay, cool. When the food arrived I was underwhelmed by the presentation. In the center of this grand and unnecessary bowl of salted ice laid a small-ish plate of ahi tuna ceviche. Maybe we have different concepts of ahi tuna, but this thing was a pale ass color and tasted, well... FISHY. Not to mention this thing came with a side of tortilla chips and saltine crackers... Excuse me saltine crackers? Where the hell does that fit into this Mexican dish? Oh also my friend ate a dish with jalape\u00f1os (she's allergic) and it was not mentioned on the menu. Very unprofessional place. Only saving grace was the tortilla chips (very tasty) and a good location with lots of unsuspecting tourists."

They have bottomless chips and salsa - they serve you three different types of salsa with your chips and they are all very delicious.\n\nFood arrived promptly. I ordered the braised pork tacos. Meat was nice and tender. It came with rice, beans, pico de gallo, salsa, sour cream, limes, cilantro, and last but not least, tortillas. Our server also brought out 5 sauces that we could try for our tacos or chips, all ranging from mild to killer spicy. If you can handle the heat, which I can't, you will love them.\n\nAlso worth noting is that one person in our party eats gluten-free only, and they have a menu for that."

I'll miss Cafe Ba Ba Reeba's Cava Sangria and awesome tapas, but the new restaurant continues to offer tasty white and red sangria and friend peppers (my favorite tapa at Cafe BR).  We ordered table side guacamole which isn't really prepared table side.  The guacamole girl (that is how she identified herself) said there were too many tables in the way to push her preparation cart over to our table.  Her guacamole cart never moved and I'm pretty sure no guacamole is ever prepared table side.  They should rename it \"20 feet away guacamole\".  The drinks, chips and salsa were all good.  We didn't try the Mexican food, but I'm sure it's as good as typical Mexican food.  The service was great and our waitress was very competent.  I really liked the Caipirinha, which is the national drink of Brazil.  This place is no Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, but I might go back for more drinks and fried peppers."

Finally I get an older guys attention and ask him if I can just sit anywhere. He tells me the restaurant is closed.

On the side its served with guacamole and some kind of sauce made from orange, which is alot spicier than I expected.Very sexy presentation.If it was a woman, I would make love to her.\n\nThe gripe I have with most Mexican joints and their fajitas, is that they tend to put a shitload of vegetables on the platter but very little steak/chicken/shrimp.Not the case here as there was a generous mix of chicken and veggies on the platter.Most joints tend to serve yellow rice and refried beans(or frijoles, as we say in Espanol.) with their fajita platters, but here they serve them with white rice and black beans.Black beans = crazy delicious, especially when you put them in a tortilla with chicken.\n\nThe margaritas here are no pussy margaritas.These things are strong and sneak up on you after you have a few.\n\nThis is definitely a repeat place for me."

Then after we ordered an app and beers he served everyone around us and never came back for me to order that encore platter of fish tacos.
