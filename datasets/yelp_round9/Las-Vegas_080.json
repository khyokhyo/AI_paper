The presentation of the meat is lacking. The steaks were ok, but not keeping up with other steakhouses on the strip. The bill wasn't shocking, so that was a nice surprise."

            "review": "I have to say, this was a very pleasant surprise. I asked the concierge at the Luxor for a recommendation for an \"upscale steakhouse\" do dinner, her reply was \"try ours\", so I did. Easily in the top 5 steak experiences ever - New Zealand beef was so tender I hardly needed a knife. Wine list is excellent, service proper and professional. You have to try the truffle mac and cheese side - perfect side to the perfectly prepared NY strip. I would recommend this place over Morton's or Ruth Chris's any day!!"

            "review": "This place has a nice clubby steakhouse feel. But for those prices I expected a lot more. First, while the bread is delicious with the pesto it was ice cold. Bread should always be heated. We split the wedge salad and the bacon was very good but the rest was very ordinary. Since it sounded so large, my friend and I decided to split the 20 oz. boneless rib eye.  I was very surprised when it came out of the kitchen on one plate and we were expected to split it ourselves!! Seriously? The kitchen couldn't plate each of our meals? And it was just a steak on a plate with zero garnish....a tasty but very thin steak. It was perfectly medium rare. We also order potato wedges ($11) and got 3 WEDGES each!!! I don't think it equaled up to one whole potato--potatoes are cheap and that was all we got for $11? The grilled asparagus was limp and no grill marks or grilled flavor. \nI don't mind paying top dollar when it is worth it but I certainly expect quality at those prices."

            "review": "Okay here we go, here we go! FANTASTIC!!!\n\nWhen staying at Luxor Hotel in Vegas or even if you aren't staying at that hotel, but are visiting Vegas. This place is a must visit. \n\nOur dinner choices were-\n\n1) an ice cold, crisp, and delicious iceburg lettuce salad, with blue cheese crumbles, and dressing, and fresh fresh plump tomatoes. One of the best i've ever had, and I am a huge fan of these salads, so i've had many.\n\n2) The main course ala carte was the Huge Australian Rock Lobster Tail-OMG!!!! Massive in size, perfectly cooked, wonderful tail.. They served it piping hot, still steaming as it arrived, with a draw of butter. \n\nNo crazy accompaniments or sauces. Just delicious firm,( never chewy), melt in your mouth lobstel that was approx 12-15 nice sized bites of this lovely sea creature. Very rich and satisfying. You and I both know how a tail will usually just be a tease, and give you like 4-5 decent sized bites. Well not this hummer. It was a mega bionic Lobster tail. I've had this type of lobster tail before, but this one put the others to shame. Both in it's preperation (perfect) and its largeness, and it's simplicity.  A must eat!\n\n3) A wonderful buttermilk and truffle shaving- side of mashed potatoes. A large helping- it was more than enough for two of us. It could've actually served three people. Very rich, and satisfying with just the right muddling of flavors. Perfect with the lobster.\n\n4) i would've liked to also try their mashed japanese eggplant and/or their grilled olive oil sea salt brushed asparagus, as they presented and smelled delicious at the table next to us, but we were getting a large enough infusion of both deliciousness and calories to overpower even the biggest foodie or Wisconsinite. (kidding)\n\n5) I am a huge cheesecake fan and have enjoyed it at literally hundreds of places over my close to 50 years. HANDS DOWN! THE BEST EVER! DIDJA HEAR ME?! THE BEST EVER...and yes i've been to the Cheesecake Factory several times for dinner. No comparison\nLet me tell you why.\nThis cheesecake was listed as a New York Cheesecake. Now let me tell you about the ingredients. Picture it....\nCombination of full fat cream cheese, and a mild light goat cheese combination (no not the pungent goat cheese). a light and mild happy well fed organic pampered goat giving it up for this heavenly concoction of dessert heaven. \nSo cream cheese and goat cheese, on an apple cinnamon graham cracker crust. (super dense and thick) perfect aftertaste of like a madagascar cinnamon. Fantastic. There's more.\nA warm caramel sauce on the side and drizzled over the slice and the plate, a small amout of crushed pecans, and  marzipan cream likely infused with a touch of citrus-.all on the side. which if you took a dab of the marzipan, the carame-l and the crushed nuts, and then a nice sized bite of the cheesecake along wtth a morsel of the curst\n\n.  Explosion!!!! of the best sweet, and a miniscule amont of slavory flavorings in your mouth that will leave you sitting with a face where one might think you are having a stroke. Such HEAVEN! The flavors and texture combined were almost shameful, it was sooooo good!\n\nMy partner enjoyed a cheese plate for dessert (3 cheeses) a delicious pungent blue cheese, a camembert that was perfection, and a goat cheese that was slightly pungent but very creamy, and all were accompanied perfectly by crusted bread, figs, nuts, chutne,y and sea salt.  Very much a go for it after dinner bit of deliciousness easily could've served two!\n\nRAPTURE! I could only take about 6 bites of the cheesecake,  before i was near coma. Could've served two people easily along with strong cup of espresso....\n\nNOW--, we enjoyed a meal that could only be described as in my top 10 EVER! and i love my food, eat out often, in both moderately priced, to very famous and pricey venues. This kicked most of the places asses- and was of the same league as Michael Minna- and Fleur De Lys in San Francisco.,,,for maybe half the price. \n\nMy partner enjoyed two glasses of a dry oakey Chardonnay and we shared a liter of sparkling italian water...\n\nTotal damage was less than $180...not including the tip. \n\nWould've easily been $300 in San Fransisco where we live.\nVery reasonably priced.\n\n The service was excellent. The ambiance very nice. It was designed well and looked like it could've been an old established 5 star 80 year old steak and seafood house We enjoyed nice dim lighting, the best leather seating, flowers, etc.. There was never a moment when we felt rushed, or that we got too little, or too much service\n\n. It was a well constructed meal that was choreographed perfectly from beginning to end. . You could NEVER go wrong. 5 star all the way.\nWe can't speak to the rest of the menu, but it held about 6 cuts of steak, about 10 exotic side dishs ,a well appointed menu, with a nice selection of wine, a nice seafood section, and a nicely put together dessert menu. \n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"

            "review": "Yes, there is a great restaurant at Luxor, yes, the previously run down Luxor and I'm not drunk when writing this.  Thanks to my Yelp and poker buddy Rod U. for dinner and the great find.\n\nFirst thing you have to try is the wild game tasting trio.  Yes, it's very polarizing as some may like it or some may not.  One thing for sure, that almost everyone will agree with is that it's unique.  \n\nStart off with the antelope Osso buco, very tender and fall off the bone, not gamey at all.  Next is the venison, can't really describe this, best effort: the texture of duck but with the taste of beef.  Finish off with wild boar loin, it's a better tasting pork with a wild game twist.\n\nStarted off with the escargot Rockefeller style, it's a different take on escargot.  Another worthy try.\n\nLuxor has done an extremely good job with their remodel, the carpets are no longer filthy, old and dated furniture was replaced.  Personally, I've avoided the Luxor because it was getting run down.  I will pay more visits here for sure."

            "review": "We ate here in 2010 after the Rock and Roll 1/2 marathon but we were totally shitfaced. I mean, I barely remember the meal. The one thing I remembered was this cream-based Mushroom soup. Holy shit. I couldn't remember what restaurant we were in, the wine, our meals, any appetizers, if we had desert...but this goddamn soup, I remembered.\n\nThis year, we wandered the Luxor and the Mandalay searching for the fabled magical soup we barely remembered sure that we ate in one of these restaurants. We asked the hostess about the soup, she confirmed and in we went.\n\nThe service was ok. The guy was good, but not great. For a waiter in a steakhouse, I wasn't impressed with his knowledge of beef. We weren't 100% about the soup, so we decided to order one, taste it and order another if it was it. When he brought the soup to the table, my girlfriend and I looked down at the plate and said, \"Yes. This is the mythical soup we remember.\" After one taste, we ordered the second bowl. Freaking unbelievable. Such good stuff.\n\nI ordered the flatiron, J ordered the beef pot roast. Without hesitation, I can say that this was the best piece of meat I've ever had. The knife slid through the tender goodness without even applying pressure to the top. It was cooked perfectly. The pot roast was good, but not great. We actually chatted about how our crockpot pot roast was a little bit better than this.\n\nThe wine selection was good, the ambiance was great and the busser service was very nice.\n\nThe following day, we stopped back again for more soup and a few glasses of wine. That's how good this soup is.\n\nWe'll be back for another flatiron and another bowl next time we're in Vegas."

Ordered the Ribeye trio: you get 3 small cuts (4-6 oz) of Australian wagyu, New Zealand, and bison. All three were distinctively different. Wagyu was best as expected: flavorful, buttery, and succulent.\nNew Zealand was second, and Bison third (gamey taste).  Wife ordered top sirloin which she enjoyed.\n\nRecommend Tender especially if you have a MyVegas reward!"

            "review": "This was our second time here at Tender.  I remember the first time being a little bit better, but it still was a great experience.\n\nSo considering Tender is inside the Luxor, the quality of this place is great.  We made reservations, we were seated within 5 minutes, and our server was efficient.  Highs and Lows:\n\n- The bread and pumpkin seed pesto was delicious.  \n- The photographer kept lurking around.  Annoying.\n- The shrimp cocktail was delicious, but not enough.  It came with 4, which is probably normal, but they served it with a number of different dipping sauces, which only accentuated that there were only 4 shrimp.\n- I got the filet mignon.  I ordered medium, but this was definitely medium rare.  Still good enough to finish.\n- The husband got the porterhouse.  He would have picked up the bone and gnawed on it if I would've let him.  It was that delicious.  He also got the mushroom sauce, which he loved.\n- The green bean casserole was great.\n- The Yukon mashed potatoes were very smooth and rich.\n- For dessert, we got the grandma's chocolate cake, which was recommended by our waiter.  It was obviously sitting in the freezer for a while, but it was delicious!\n- We also ordered the espresso martini with our dessert...FREAKING AMAZING!  It was sweet, but strong and super delicious!!!"

I ordered the Kobe meatloaf with \"foie gras and truffle\" which were either in minute quantities are not in the dish because I didn't notice either.  The portion was small and food was ok, but not great. One of the members of our group found rocks in his food and they tried to claim it off as uncooked rice.  As Indians who probably eat rice for 2 meals a day quite frequently, this felt like an insult to our intelligence.  The waiter was brash and didn't bother to apologize for it either.  The food is way overpriced and the service is average at best. Go somewhere else if you want a good dining experience."

Our group debated back and forth between Tender at the Luxor and Strip Steakhouse at Mandalay. Out of convenience we chose Tender.\n\nThat was a mistake. \n\nThe staff was friendly, the decor was pleasant. And then it went slightly downhill.\n\nThe appetizers were just okay. The oysters were oysters and tasted fairly fresh. The salads were pretty unimaginative across the table. I ordered the standard Iceberg wedge and it was okay.\n\nI ordered the beef strip steak. It was fatty and a little grisly. Another guy ordered the ribeye medium rare and it came as beat-red rare as I've seen. Not to mention the meat was not that TENDER. Two guys ordered the grass-fed bison steaks and those were pretty good. They had a nice grass-fed taste and were cooked proper. But they weren't brilliantly seared or overly juicy.\n\nThe sides were pretty mediocre as well. We had the mushrooms, the creamed spinach, and mac and cheese. Nothing out of the ordinary or memorable.\n\nOverall, it wasn't the worst steakhouse experience by any stretch. It was \"just okay\". We left FULL but UNIMPRESSED.\n\nAnd unfortunately, with all the amazing choices for steakhouses in Vegas, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SETTLE FOR \"JUST OKAY\"?"

Will definitely never return and it makes me to sick to my stomach that this place got $200 from me. \n\nSTAY AWAY!"

They were great - sat down our party of five, got us drinks and food superfast, but didn't rush us, and got us out and to the show (unfortunately). \n\nWe had the surf and turf burger (HOW DECADENT! kobe beef and lobster?!?) which was one of the most amazing things ever. Also the trio of soups (delicious, but it wasn't steak so not as spectacular as it could've been), the ONION RINGS which somehow were as melty and  incredible as a hot Krispy Kreme donut, the roasted carrots (YUM) and the blue cheese bacon iceberg wedge. Which was also fantastic.\n\nIt was all good good, good, so good. OH and the best Mojito I've had, like, anywhere. It was fabulous. We should've stayed there all night instead of rushing off to that absolutely godawful show."

The place is upper casual to fine dinning. I sat at the bar and was great buy a great bar tender. I placed my order of the Kansas City Strip steak and a side of roasted cream corn. My meal came promptly but I did notice not much grill marks on my steak. I tasted the cream corn and it was very good and very rich! As I started in on my Strip steak it noticed it was kind of tough. It was cooked med rare but it was grainy and tough. The bar tender asked how it was and I shared the corn was great but the steak was kind of tough. I told him not to worry because I was going to work though it. I ate about a 1/3 on the steak and I was done. The general manager came to me and asked if it was not to my liking. I explained and he removed it from my bill. I was surprised as I didn't send it back.  As the corn started to cool it became thick and starchy like paste but was still tasty. Good customer service good cocktails but the name should be \"Not so Tender steak\" this night!"

Reminds me of an old country club style or maybe even a law office with dark wood and comfortable booths. also a plus.\n\nThe wine and cocktail lists were good. They had a wide variety of stuff, this is standard in Vegas though.\n\nI had the halibut for an entree and I must admit it was pretty good! The reason why this only gets three stars is because of the appetizers. The chili was bland, I like staggs better and it's much cheaper. The shrimp cocktail was...small, expensive and are probably the same shrimp you can get at the all you can eat buffet. \n\nOverall, food was average, everything else was great. There's so many good places in Las Vegas, it's hard to give this anything more than 3 stars."

It's a bad idea - don't do it.\n\nFirst, we ordered an 8oz Filet medium and the sucker came out rare - not only that, but it wasn't even one 8oz piece, it was two smaller pieces set together closely to make it look like one. When I told the waiter, he offered no apologies but took it back to the kitchen on my dirty bread plate (which I am certain is a health code violation). Several minutes later, he dropped it back off onto the table and despite the outside looking black, the inside was still rare. Sent it back a second time, once again, no apology or assurance that this kind of thing never happens at a steakhouse that charges $44 for a single filet. When it came back to the table a third time, it was jerky - burnt to a crisp on the outside and well done on the inside.  Perhaps we need to send Chef a link to how to cook a steak! The meat itself was nothing special, it could have very well been picked up from Kroger.  We also got the scallop dish, which was perfection and the reason for the second star.\n\nAnother disappointing thing is my friend had inadvertently tipped over her wine glass and it fell into her quinoa and another waiter saw it happen and quickly came to clean up the spill and take the dish away. What is crazy is that nobody even offered to replace the half glass of wine she spilled. We are about to drop $150 for a meal that was poorly prepared and you can't even offer us that courtesy? \n\nManagement should be replaced, there is no excuse to have a staff that inept. I suspect this is why most of the tables sat unoccupied on a busy Saturday night. \n\nMost of the positive reviews on Yelp are from years ago. This place is currently in the toilet. If you are in the mood for good steak, I'd suggest trying The Barrymore. It's far better and a bit less expensive."

Das Restaurant ist recht gediegen eingerichtet und hat wirklich viel Atmosph\u00e4re, es schadet keinesfalls sich angemessen zu kleiden d.h. bitte nicht zu Leger erscheinen. Die Speisekarte bietet wie im Steakhaus \u00fcblich diverse Fleischsorten, hier zun\u00e4chst jedoch ohne Beilagen. Eine ausreichend gro\u00dfe Beilagenauswahl sollte es jedem erm\u00f6glichen etwas nach den eigenen Vorlieben zu finden. Das Preissegment ist etwas gehoben, aber in den USA ist Essen gehenden au\u00dferhalb von Burgerbuden ohnehin teurer. Um hier mal einen kleinen Vergleich anzustellen, wir haben im Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 f\u00fcr zwei Personen knapp \u00fcber 100$ ausgegeben, hier im Steakhaus ca. 160$, jedoch war der Aufenthalt aus unserer Sicht sehr viel angenehmer.  Der Gast bekommt zum Einstieg einen Brotkorb mit 3 unterschiedlichen Broten und einen \u00d6l-Pesto So\u00dfe, zur allgemeinen \u00dcberraschung schmeckt das Brot ausgezeichnet und ist ein echtes Highlight im Land der \"Luft-Toast-Brote\".Wer ein gutes St\u00fcck Fleisch und ein Glas anst\u00e4ndigen Wein mag, wird hier zufrieden sein.

I ordered the most expensive steak on the menu as a rare treat. (A5 Waygu Beef filet mignon) I was so excited! Unfortunately, the steak came overcooked. I ordered medium rare and it arrived medium and medium well on the ends. Bummer! \n\nThe waiter, Dewey, was prompt in asking me what I wanted him to do about it, although that made me uncomfortable. He did get the manager who offered to discount or to remake my order. I chose to take the unknown discount as I did not have time to deal with the re-do. This was not the best experience, but the steak was still yummy!\n\nWe also ordered sides of creamed corn and kale/broccoli rabe which were excellent in addition to a lovely bottle of Justin Cab well priced at $65. My boyfriend ordered a porterhouse steak which was prepared perfectly and the red wine sauce (ordered separately from a list of extras) was textbook perfection. We were full and were not tempted by dessert, but I wish that I had been as I am certain that it would have been excellent.\n\nI would have no trouble recommending this restaurant to anyone looking for an \"old-school\" steakhouse experience.

Lobster bisque was mild and creamy, wild mushroom was earthy and flavorful, and the chili was spicy.  My favorite was the wild mushroom. $15.00\n\nCaesar salad with anchovies. Delicious! $11.00\n\nWashington Kobe-style 20 oz. ribeye. He loved it.  Cooked medium well, and still juicy and flavorful! $54.00 (Add ons: Mushroom sauce $4.00, caramelized onions $5.00)  \n\nRibeye Trio: 6 oz. of each-New Zealand ribeye, Bison ribeye, and Washington Kobe-style ribeye.  Everything was cooked medium well, and the bison had the best flavor and texture.  For some reason, my piece of Washington Kobe-style ribeye was very dry. $75.00  (Add on: Mushroom sauce $4.00)  \n\nSide dish of kale and broccolini, topped with nutritional yeast and chopped cashew. Citrusy!  It was a great accompaniment to our very meat-heavy dinner!  $11.00\n\nPrices = moderate to pricey. $191.88 with taxes.   \n\nService = attentive and courteous. \n\nDecor = awesome. Dark. We loved the light fixture with horns.  You'll know it. :)\n\nWe were there for dinner on a Friday evening and it wasn't too busy.  Reservations are available, but I'm not sure if it's necessary."

Rest assure, that's where the compliments end. \nI came to the Luxor to see Criss Angel with my sister and our men. we had called to book tickets for dinner as well. Tender was recommended. They gave us a list of options for a meal with a few exquisite options and based on those choices we agreed to fine there. \nUpon arrival we receive an entirely different menu than what was described to us. When we notified the manager, he explained that we were told the wrong menu, that the box office has an outdated list. (Not our problem, we booked this place based on THAT description) After our expressed disappointment that we would not be getting the Filet Mignon that we were promised, he told us he would talk to the chef an see if he can have that made for us. (I'm confused...why he would have to talk to the chef since that's something that's on their full length menu) He returned and told us that the chef was able and will make us what we asked for. (This whole ordeal took 30 minutes! Keep in mind we had a show to get to) \nOnce the meal arrived we noticed immediately how large our filet's were. Cutting into them, we were sure this was NOT anywhere near a Filet Mignon! I'm sure they dressed up a chuck steak and tried to pass it off for what we ordered. They took us as fools! This meal alone was $100 a head! And even without great expectations, they fell wayyyy too short. \nTired of complaining with the little time they had left us to race to our show we ate in peace, and by peace I mean the waiter was absent almost the entire time. My sister had to get up and chase him down at one point! And no...it was no where near busy. \nAt the end of the meal, the manager promised to comp one of the bottles of wine we ordered, and only reduced the price by 25%. This was incredibly bad service. And to treat us like that, was incredibly disrespectful. I wouldn't advice going to this place....not unless you want to feel drained and insulted."

After complaining about serving me scraps the manager asked if I would like a whole new steak. I told her yes, the first time maybe but not after 20 minutes of this! \n\nAt this point the lobster is gone the sides are almost gone and I didn't come here and order steak and lobster to be forced to eat one item at a time. \n\nBring a new plate all together the way I ordered it. Remember this wasn't even close. Two stages off on your cooking temperatures. The center was slightly warm or even room temperature you blew it!\n\nI opted to just cancel the steak. My son was done eating and as mentioned most of my other dishes were finished also. \n\nThen the bill came and they charged me for the sauce that I was not able to eat because I had no steak! Now this morning I noticed they have charged me full price for a lobster dinner vs. the add on price of 39.00 for lobster to be added to any meal as the menu clearly states. \nHence steak AND lobster. \n\nMy wife and I enjoyed this place several years ago and enjoyed it so much we dined their two nights in a row. \n\nObviously chef Kenneth Fazel was either not running this place at that time or if he was in fact the chef during our previous visits he must have recently taken up Smoking crack because it was a night and day difference from previous experiences. \nEither this guy doesn't deserve to be at these type's of establishments or he needs to clean house and start over!!!!\n\nI'm not talking about just blowing it on a steak. You guys blew it on several levels. \n\n\nA very disappointed local!!!!"

No bone!\" He stares blankly and says, \".....Well, it HAD a bone,\" and walks away! \n\n\"Ok, don't panic,\" I tell myself, \"the SERVER will make this right!\" When I explain the whole bone-gate scandal, his response is, \"Yes, it HAS a bone!\" At this point, I gave up. When the manager comes around to ask if everything is wonderful, I explain to her that my wife and I have traded steaks, and her response was that she'd tell the chef to watch those steaks in the future. Shouldn't he have been watching them all night? Why were we \"Patient Zero?\" \n\nAnywho, we won't be returning. For that much money, they should be able to nail a steak temperature way better than you or I can at home on the grill, and their first test on hiring waitstaff should be \"Bone Recogniton 101!\""

You would never expect a steakhouse of this caliber to be hidden in the Luxor, but yet it is. It's worth the trek through the dated casino to experience a meal that will leave you yearning to return!\n\nWe've dined at Tender five or six times now. We found it due to the MyVegas rewards program and while we no longer use their rewards, we still stop at Tender each time we're in Vegas. It's that good.\n\nOver the years, we've had the creamed exotic mushroom soup ($12) (delicious but very rich), Maine lobster bisque ($15) (also delicious but very rich), Charcuterie board ($16) (good with a variety of cured meats, cheeses and mustards, etc.), Yukon mashed potatoes ($9) (very good), fried potato wedges ($11) (a tad greasy), the filet tasting trio (1-New Zealand organic, grass fed; 2-Black Angus grain fed; 3-Wagyu), the Snake River Wagyu sirloin and also the Wagyu filet. We've tried a lot on their menu! But, now we always have the Wagyu filet. It is, hands down, the best steak either of us has eaten! Period. No debate. It's very reasonably priced at $115 for 8 ounces and it needs no garnish or sauce; it stands alone. It's so good, on our last trip, we ate at Tender two nights in a row and had the Wagyu filet both nights. Folks, this is the kind of steak that is so tender is almost loses its shape! It literally starts to spread on the plate since the marbling of the fat is like spider webbing. You can cut it with a fork and that's no joke. I can't stress enough that if you're a steak lover, you have to try this at least once. Although, consider yourself warned...you WILL be hooked! (Note: They have a Wagyu Ribeye, 10oz for $135)\n\nAs for the service at Tender, we've had Tom as our server for all but two of our visits. He's extremely knowledgeable, efficient and a super nice person. He's great with the wine pairings and always has a smile on his face. If I were rating Tender on the steak and Tom, it would be five stars! But since our service wasn't as good the two times we didn't have Tom and due to a mix-up with our reservation on one visit (and how that was handled), I have to give it four.\n\nWe will go back again...but we will make sure Tom is working that night."

Stuart Chase.\n\nPersonal Musings - What makes a restaurant great?  Cutting edge, imaginative food?  Michelin quality service?  Magical ambiance?  Dare I say, as a foodie, they all contribute, but Michelin stars, James Beard awards, even yelp stars mean jack $hit.  Great dining experiences are based on the company one chooses to share the meal.  Everything else just plays a supporting role.  To some, it's the neighborhood deli down the street or the okazuya of their childhood.  To me, simply the place that I have celebrated more evenings with friends, old and new, forged more new relationships in a new city than anywhere else...\n\n170 visits.  Solid food.  Outstanding service (especially at the bar).  Comfortable ambiance.   When a rare problem arises, it's corrected with no fuss or excess intrusion.   Nothing get's in the way of a great time.\n\nNew management is currently updating the menu and the wine list.  Many old time favorites are gone, replaced by simpler dishes and seasonal specials.\n\nFor starters, the seasonal heirloom tomato plate (over a dozen different types of tomatoes dressed in EVOO, topped with pink Himalayan sea salt and micro basil) is a must.  Colorful and playful for the palate.  The contrast in sweetness and acidity between the different types of tomatoes is very pronounced.  The exotic mushroom soup is also outstanding.  Mushroomy flavor in a broth seemingly including bone marrow in consistency and flavor.   Fresh oysters and a classic shrimp cocktail round also make for good eats.\n\nThis is a steakhouse and the beef shines.  The A5 Kobe is the real deal.  Ask for the certificate if you don't believe it.  Offered in both a filet and boneless rib eye, absolutely delicious and the lowest price anywhere on the Strip.   Very tender, sweet, with a clean beef flavor.  Very buttery.  Order it simply seared (below rare) for the best experience.   A good selection of cuts from different producers including an outstanding bison rib eye.  All are perfectly seared, cooked to temperature, simply seasoned with salt and pepper.\n\nOther standout mains include the always delicious wild game trio (venison osso bucco, elk medallions, and wild boar rack chop) and the full size, perfectly braised and sauced venison osso bucco.  \n\nSolid sides including a very fairly priced bone marrow ($6).  Great albeit huge desserts, try the souffles.\n\nVery good selection of wines by the glass; massive pours.  Well chosen wine list with reasonable Vegas resort pricing.\n\nExperiences ready for the making.\n\nBravo."

It's located in a property I don't frequent often, so it allowed me to venture outside of my comfort zone. The restaurant itself is beautiful and I liked the fact that it was split into several dining areas, which gave it a more intimate feeling.\n\nThe food and service were both spot on. Our server was very attentive throughout the meal, kept drinks filled, and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I started with one of the special salads he mentioned... beefsteak tomato and mozzarella. It was one of the largest caprese salads I've ever had, but the amount of tomatoes heavily outnumbered the amount of mozzarella on the plate. It was still delicious, nonetheless. My husband enjoyed a nicely prepared caesar salad. We both ordered filets, which were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and shared a side of parmesan potato wedges. The potatoes were good, but it wasn't quite that sharable size I'm used to seeing on a la carte sides.\n\nI would definitely recommend this unassuming steak house to others. It's a nice change from some of the high end steak houses in other Vegas properties that charge more for food that is equally as good."

He liked his so much he ordered about 3 more of them ;) \nWe shared the surf and turf sliders for our appetizer, I had the braised 1.25 lb Maine lobster, my boyfriend had the 8 oz natural certified Angus beef and for our sides we got the grilled asparagus and crispy macaroni and cheese. \nFor dessert we ordered the sampler of 4 different sorbet flavors. I believe they were red orange, mango, raspberry and a cinnamon pear? Whatever they were, they were delicious. \n\nIf you are staying at the Luxor, make your way down to Tender.

Girlfriend and I both got the filet medium rare, broccoli, asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, and lobster bisque with pinot grigio to drink.  Steaks were juicy and well cooked.  I added the A1-style homemade sauce (bomb!) and a crab medallion (make your own surf and turf for half the price.  Total bill with tip was under $200 for 2 people.  There is a $20 off coupon in all the rooms if you stay at the hotel.   \n\nOnly thing stopping this place from getting 5 stars is that it lacks windows or a view.

This was much better than Camelot at Excalibur...... don't waste your time going there, we went there for Mother's day and will not return to Camelot.\n\nMescalin salad was good, I requested cherry tomatoes instead of sun dried tomatoes which they did...... it was good.\n\nThey ask you if you want steak sauce but they don't tell you there is a fee which I found a bit amusing.  He named three or so, so I picked the Bearnaise and we were charged $3 for it. I don't really care but it would have been nice to know before hand.\n\nOH, if you check in on 4 square, there is a special, buy one glass of one, get one free, so that is an added plus :) \n\nWe will probably go back here again.

From the moment my wife and I entered this restaurant at the Luxor Hotel this evening, the service was disappointing. I won't list all the shortcomings but suffice it to say that it was very unsatisfactory. And in my discussion with the manager after the meal, she agreed with me.\n\n2. Viewing their menu and prices, prior to selecting this restaurant, is difficult. The restaurant does not have its own website. The easiest way to access their menu is through the Luxor Hotel website. But when you do find it, no prices are listed for any of their menu items. Hmmmm, why not? (I later found that I could find their menu prices through a Google search but the prices listed there are already out of date.)\n\n\"Fine dining\" offerings at the Luxor are limited to only Tender Steak & Seafood. Given the shortcomings we experienced, this might explain why, on a holiday evening, the restaurant was almost empty of diners. \n\nFor my next steak dinner in Las Vegas I'll take my beautiful wife to Ruth's Chris Steak House at Harrah's. Yes, the prices will be about the same but the restaurant is more straightforward about listing them, the food quality will probably be slightly better, and there is little doubt that their service will be far superior."

Clearly the best place in the joint is Cathouse, but didn't book that early enough because of questions of whether it was inappropriate for a 13 year old girl.  Wanted to try a different place (company?) but kept getting steered to Tender.\n\nVery surprised when I saw it, it is a beautiful space.  I believe it is very new as there were not yet even the directional signs for it in the lobby.  Actually, was pleasantly surprised by look of all the various restaurants and lounges in the Luxor.\n\nThe wines by the glass list was fantastic.  It's probably a bad thing that I knew all the wines since I don't really know as much as I would like about wine, but nevertheless I knew all the offerings and, better yet, liked them all.  So that was positive.\n\nThe menu looked absolutely fantastic.  So many choices that looked appealing.  Started with the ceasar salad since that is a true way to determine if a place is good or not, by the quality of their ceasar.  This one, not so good.  Trio of soups was equally uninsprining, the butternut squash/apple was decent, but the wild mushroom and the lobster/crab both just tasted like cream.\n\nGot the Japanese Wagyu fillet (I just can't help myself).  Was it like true Japanese Wagyu?  No.  Was it one of the best fillets I have ever eaten.  Probably.  Does that make it worth the three digit price tag?  Probably not.\n\nAly wasn't too impressed with the menu so I suggested that she get the lobster.  It came in a ramekin that was probably four inches in diameter.  When a thirteen year old girl who eats more than a quarter of the food on her plate about once in a blue moon finishes everything in two minutes and then jokes \"well, I guess I am done with my lobster\", you know the portion is a little light.  They do have a larger lobster on the menu, but the meat from a 1-1/4 pounder should have been plenty.\n\nShe liked the mashed potatoes.  I liked the approach for the creamed spinach.  They don't cook the spinach to death like most places do, it is still kind of fresh.  The garlic cream sauce was also pretty good, but the entire dish was ruined by too much salt.\n\nDoubt I will go back because if I ever eat in the Luxor again I want to try Cathouse, but if the situation arose I would not hesitate to go back to Tender."

The food is SPECTACULAR, even though the atmosphere and service is not on par with that of a fine dining establishment. If you plan to check this place out, you must try the lobster risotto. Also, they have A5 wagyu kobe-style beef that is to.die.for. The pricing is similar to other fine dining restaurants, and rightly so due to the quality of the food.

I thought this dish had a good flavor, but the escargot was definitely lacking in quantity...we found one, maybe two tiny bits in each bite. The soup was disappointing to say the least. I am usually a big fan of cream of mushroom soup but this one had a sour note to it that ruined the soup for me. The lobster bisque was also sour and had no lobster flavor at all. Out of the three soups, the one that was most edible was the kobe chili. Even then, it was so over-salted that I only ate three or four bites at most. The entire meal had me reaching for a beverage just to drown out the saltiness. I shared the porterhouse with my boyfriend, which was a good choice because that piece of meat was huge! It was actually cooked to perfection and was quite tasty. The foie gras that I ordered with the steak was a good companion, so I was satisfied with this portion of the meal.

This is how it was described on the menu: seared diver-caught day-boat jumbo scallops, roasted corn quinoa & lobster, blue crab salad.  That is definitely not what I was served.  I received scallops on a bed of PLAIN quinoa that was the dryest, most tasteless quinoa I've ever had.  It was topped with the most tasteless guacamole that seemed to be prepared with edamame.  It was topped with very thin, overcooked, hard bacon bits that tasted like pieces of wood.  It also had some edamame tossed on top of it.  There was no crab salad, no lobster and no corn.  It was terrible.  The service was mediocre and the restaurant was expensive.  It was probably the biggest dining disappointment I've had in 5 years.  Truly sad that my fast food burger from In-N-Out was better than the meal I had here."

Our wait staff was attentive and ensured that everything they could control was well above standards. \n\nSo why did I rate this a 3? This is a steakhouse. And while we were there, the place was 1/2 empty, meaning that the chef(s) were not overwhelmed by a huge rush of orders. However, in our time there, we saw three meals sent back due to meat being undercooked. Two filets at the table next to us, and my lamb. This wasn't simply underdone because we were picky people - the center of these cuts were all rare. Cold & uncooked.\n\nThe wait staff was quick to respond and get these resolved, but at a steakhouse of this tier, this occurring 3x in one sitting is simply a red flag. \n\nThat said, once cooked properly, the meat was phenomenal. The wine & cocktail list is well above standard. The starters were perfect in size and preparing our pallets for the main course. And dessert was spot-on. \n\nI will qualify that the desserts being spot-on comment had nothing to do with the fact they were comped due to the meat being sent back.\n\nThis taken into account, I would actually return. The peripheral meal and experience was phenomenal. Perhaps I'm too forgiving, but I'd still recommend Tender to anyone visiting Vegas looking for a solid steakhouse."

We were approached by the waiter (whom was from Albany, NY- being from the east I picked up on the accent). He might as well been from Jersey because he was very brash and not at all professional. \nI started out ordering the tuna trio and my guest ordered one of the salads with a glass of sav. blanc and kahula and milk. The first coarses were okay- nothing to write home about, but by far the best part of our meal. We then ordered our 2nd coarses; I ordered the hanger steak cooked medium rare with a side of spinach and my guest ordered the fish trio (scallops, shrimp, and bass). My 2nd coarse had been prepared really rare, I mean almost blue (burnt on the outside, raw in the middle). The silver lining hadn't been taken off the steak so I choked with every bite. My guests scallops (her first time trying them) were grossly over cooked, little rubber bouncy balls would be a more accurate description and her entire dish was just unappealing. She finished eating her plate first and the busser removed the plate before I was done. The waiter came over and my guests plate was gone and he said, \"let me guess your steak was overcooked?\" Really???? She didn't even have the steak and when he took my dish away, which was barely touched he didn't even ask if it was okay. The bill was $190 for 2. \n\nYou can do so much better in Vegas. Don't waste your time on this outdated restaurant!"

Good thing I can do math.\n\nI was roped into making a reservation here after the Criss Angel show when speaking with a hotel rep on the phone. She claimed it was only $30 per person per entree. What a lie. \n\nI like how they have two servers who wait on you to maximize the quality of service. That was really impressive. We never had a lull in service the entire time we were there.\n\nWe started out with a complimentary amuse-bouche of kobe beef in sour cream and chives. Delicious. I was really excited about the rest of the food after that.\n\nI ordered the pumpkin and fuji apple soup which was wonderful and the Scottish Salmon with pilaf and roasted red peppers. The portions here are pretty small...so I was comfortably full afterwards and not stuffed beyond belief. The pumpkin and fuji apple soup came with some kind of pumpkin spice bread and apple butter. The butter was incredible...it was sweet and dissolved in your mouth. \n\nI was less impressed with the salmon. Granted, it's not salmon season and I should have thought about that...but I thought that because it was Scottish, maybe it would be better. It was just mediocre. Nothing I would ever order again.\n\nThe problem with this restaurant is that it was EXTREMELY hot. As in EXTREMELY hot. I was SO overheated that I couldn't enjoy my meal and almost had to leave. By dessert time, I ran out of there and hopped into the bar Minus 5 to cool off. \n\nI would come back here, but I'd order steak, as it is a steakhouse. The bf ordered an awesome looking steak which was very tender and delicious. I'd definitely do that. But just be forewarned that after 2 appetizers and 2 entrees (on the lower side of pricing) it still came out to over $130. Bummer."

I should have jumped in the car and went to one of my usual hangouts but i was staying at the luxor and didn't want to leave the hotel.  the menu is very boring.  not a single signature dish.  yes, it's a steak house but come on.  to the food.  we started with a caesar and a bowl of lobster bisque.  the caesar, like everything else, lacked seasoning.  it was passable, but barely.  the soup was a little better.  no where near enough lobster flavor but it was ok.  it could have used a dash of cognac or something too.  we shared the porterhouse.  it came out before we were done with our salad and soup which was a complete turnoff.  it was also under cooked.  not just on the inside, but on the outside as well.  the broiler they are using isn't hot enough.  it doesn't put a nice char on the meat.  the steak was also severly under seasoned.  it was also a choice cut (which i would bet was bought from larry's meats).  at 58 bucks i felt violated.  we also had the obligitory lobster mac and cheese.  it was pretty good.  finally, we sat at 6:45.  when we received the check i presented a 15 dollar off coupon i was given when checking in.  i was told it was not good after 7.  i guess when you rely on tourists you don't have to go the extra mile.  how is that working out for you vegas? in a few words, this place is a complete turn off."

            "review": "TENDER steak and & seafood looks like an old-school steakhouse, with its dark leather chairs, hazel floors, and its burnished umber surroundings. But this restaurant in the Luxor also plays by its own rules, offering diners a chance to sample meats like bison, venison and boar.\n\nMy first visit here was a late night one. The main restaurant was slowly closing for the night, but the bar and lounge were still open. We ordered a selection of cheeses and the charcuterie board that included wild boar sausage, duck ham, and antelope pastrami. Those quick bites hit the spot, and along with their selection of Belgian ales, led to our decision to visit a second time.    \n\nUnfortunately, trip number two was a bit of a disappointment. \n\nFirst the good. The appetizer I sampled was astounding. It was a short rib ravioli that was cooked to perfection and served with a horseradish marinara sauce and a bit of crisped smoked bacon. I would highly recommend it.\n\nHaving dabbled with their game meats the last time I was here, I ordered the wild game tasting as my main. I was feeling adventurous, and I imagined if it was good enough to be on the menu alongside the Omaha beef and Kurobuta pork chops, they knew what they were doing. The tasting included three meats, but sadly, each one was tougher and a bit more disheartening than the last one. \n\nI need to stress that this wasn't my first encounter with wild game. I've typically eaten it in bit and bites, most often in sausage, or cured, or served tartare style, as I did on my first visit to TENDER. I know these meats can be quite tough if cooked less than perfectly, which is why they're often served as charcuterie items. You get the full flavor without having to gnaw through meat that would be better used to make Lady Gaga a Grammy dress.\n\nThe wild boar loin was the best of the lot and did echo this restaurant's name, but the venison medallion served alongside it was a bit too dense. Venison tends to be drier than beef, because it lacks the same kind of fat marbling in its meat, and this cut was cooked just a bit too long for my liking. Next.\n\nThe Nilgai antelope osso buco was even more vexing. A perfect osso buco is cooked low and slow and falls off the bone. This one was simply unyielding. To be fair, I've never cooked antelope myself, much less in an osso buco, but my understanding is that the process is very similar to the veal version, and the meat should be cooked slowly until it is fork tender. This was not the case on this night, and most of the meat on my plate remained uneaten.\n\nIt's truly unfortunate, because this dish was priced at $36, which is not unreasonable. It's low enough where one might be willing to gamble that amount for a new foodie experience -- this is Vegas after all -- and a fair price for the exotic meats  included in this tasting. But they were definitely not representative of what they could be, and I would hate to think someone might be enticed to try them (as I was) and leave with the wrong impression: \n\n\"I went to Vegas and ate antelope! It wasn't that good. It was dry and tough. It's probably just a gimmick, but I can scratch it off my bucket list.\" \n\nI am not, however, ready to condemn TENDER completely, and might try a regular steak there some day, just to see if they've got the chops to handle the chops. I did really like the side I ordered with my sampler -- a trio of exotic grains that included a quinoa and corn pilaf,  farro piccolo, and black forbidden rice. \n\nI am also fond of the cheeses they have available, that are typically served with fresh baguette, honeycomb, dates, quince paste and a cherry fig chutney. I would suggest the cabernet sauvignon soaked Purple Moon Cheddar from California's San Joaquin Valley, the nutty Marieke gouda from Wisconsin, and the butter-like San Andreas sheep's milk cheese from Valley Ford, California, if they're ever on the menu."

Tender was no exception.\n\nOn Saturday we walked the strip all day, completely forgetting that it was Saturday and we should probably make reservations for dinner at some point.\n\nWe got back to the room around 7, and the BF called the concierge (we were staying at Mandalay Bay) to look for reservations within the hour, since we were starving.  After trying several options, Tender had the earliest opening.\n\nWe were seated right away, in a round lovey-dovey booth, and ordered a bottle of Ruffino Chianti, one of my favorites.\n\nFor appetizers, we enjoyed half a dozen Virginia oysters and carpaccio.  Entrees were the hanging tender and bone-in ribeye, both medium rare, which we shared, and a side of the sweet potato puree, which we also shared.\n\nBoth steaks were delicious and perfectly cooked, it worked out well that I liked the ribeye better and he enjoyed the hanging tender better.  Either that, or he was just trying to make me happy.  I was.  The only thing that makes me sad is I didn't get around to eating my leftovers.\n\nService, d\u00e9cor, and food, all outstanding.

Went to LV for a long weekend and we decided on Tender for dinner our first night.  The menu has so many delicious items to choose from, and, they start you off with delicious bread and pesto dipping oil.  Our server, (Dewey I believe) was amazing, he was attentive, informative and friendly.  The menu is al a carte, but, the portion of the sides are enough to split.  (we had a group of 4 and I would say each side is enough for 4).  The bar made yummy drinks and the time between sitting down, ordering and receiving food, was just enough to make it a comfortable experience.  The restaurant offers little tables for your purse to keep it off the floor which, was nice.  The decor would be considered a bit dated if it were a standalone restaurant in BOS but, for Vegas, it was great.  There is a woman that walks around to take \"prom\" style photos of your table (I find this is a staple at most of the restaurants I have been at in LV), we had fun with it."

Every hotel has a steakhouse so it wasn't like we looked over all the menus or anything to pick this one. It was chosen sheerly by the virtue of being in the same place as the show we were seeing. With that said I felt it was a very, very good choice.\n\nWe started with a cheese plate that had 3 types of cheese and accoutrements for a mere $14, which I thought was very reasonable. I appreciated the fact that they had a good assortment to choose from, I think around 10 cheeses. I also had a glass of champagne and Nick had a Chimay. Both of these I still found to be a pretty good deal, considering where we were in terms of city and restaurant style.\n\nAfter that we shared a salad with comice pears, smoked bacon and blue cheese, roasted fingerling potatoes with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and chives, and grilled asparagus in a lemon citrus olive oil in addition to our main entrees. I had a black angus Niman beef strip steak and Nick had a Berkshire Heritage pork with apricot chutney, both of which were cooked exactly the way we ordered them and were priced in the mid to high 30s.\n\nWhile, this was definitely an expensive meal it was also a meal worth the price. We had the dual servers so when one wasn't around to help us the other was no matter what we needed. There is something about this system that I really like because you have two familiar faces so you're never left without drink refills or other necessities, but they also aren't done by a stranger each time so you get a sense of familiarity throughout your meal."

She told us she would have a manager stop by which never happened. All in all the worst restaurant experience we've had in Las Vegas. \n\nI ended up emailing their customer service the next day and they apologized for the crappy service and emailed me a 25% discount code for our next visit. That was nice, but their website is so confusing that you can't find where to redeem it. Luxor Fail!"

            "review": "I'm not sure where to start.....\n\nFirst off I love the Luxor and the vibe it gives off. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I had reservations for us 2 plus another 2. 4 altogether on New Year's Eve around 8pm. \n\nWe walked given the convenience from Mandalay Bay. Right on time, there's a line at the hostess' desk and we get seated promptly. I thought okay it will be great since we were taken care of immediately.\n\nWe got seated at a big, and I mean huge round table for the 4 of us. I will admit it's better than being smushed in a booth or having no elbow room to eat so no complaints there. \n\nTick tock.. I kid you not we literally sat there for 20 minutes. Observing all other tables, NO menus, NO water or NO drink offers, NO waiter to approach us at all. We even tried politely waving down the busy servers running around and none gave us the time of day. Other tables probably got more attention than us. I'm not sure why. My thing is, I was also a hostess AND a waitress and if you are unable to attend to your newly sat table a minute or 2 within seating, have them wait until so. Not at the table to feel like they're being ignored. I was really frustrated but tried to not let it show since we were out with others\n\nOkay, then our waiter arrives and he seemed exhausted. He asked for waters, sparkling, bottled, iced. That took another TEN minutes. Oh AND THEN he asked for drinks after waters. We all ordered different glasses of wine, which again took probably another 10 minutes. I'm starving. I'm frustrated. I just want to order and get to the new year (which isn't a way to \"enjoy\" dinner)\n\nSo let's get going on food:\nWe had apps like the veggie/hummus dip platter (which was mediocre for a place like this I think) and mind you that our food took a very, VERY long time, even for an appetizer or BREAD with pesto oil. \n\nThey had a really good special for New Year's Eve, which we took advantage of. I believe it was a 36oz ribeye on the bone for an amazing price. So we did 2 orders or that which were a la carte. One piece medium rare, the other medium well. \n\nWe also added on another special they were offering - truffled mashed potatoes (the only really delicious thing here lol) \n\nCreamed spinach - I wouldn't even bother\n\nAsparagus - basic asparagus steamed with a spritz of lemon for flavor \n\nSo. Our food finally came out. After chowing down on bread and our basic app we just want real food.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I shared the medium rare. I personally love meat on the more blue side but I could have sworn this was just RARE. It was beautiful on the outside but... it wasn't cooked medium rare AT ALL. You'd think a steakhouse would know what's up???? \n\nSo... we go on and ask for horseradish both creamy and not and that took another 10 minutes to receive. The waiter also rolled his eye at my fianc\u00e9 when asking. \n\nDinner was so-so. I'm telling you the mashed potatoes were the only thing worth waiting for. \n\nSo another thing that ticked me off was that upon calling for the reservation, I mentioned it was my fianc\u00e9 a birthday. Which really, his birthday falls on New Year's Eve and I was expecting at least a decent experience. Jeez, I had to remind the waiter about his birthday and it was SO rudely taken upon that it wasn't a surprise anymore. Which in the back of my head I'm just annoyed because I KNOW I told the host who helped me on the phone that it was for a birthday celebration. \n\nSo blah blah they bring out this trio dessert that was okay. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, brownie muffin thing, and another pastry. It was whatever. I just wanted to get out of there by now. \n\nSo we try to salvage the night and get out and the waiter mentions don't forget to give your Mlife card for points so we did. And only to find out 2 weeks later our points didn't even post on our account. REALLY? \n\nWe call customer service and they say we have to go out of OUR way to call Tender again, request them to email Mlife adjustments to do so accordingly. We have to keep going out of our way for an already cheaply experience? Dinner wasn't cheap and we didn't even get our points... when our waiter forsure took our mlife card and payment card. It's not worth the frustration, the rude service, the unawareness of tables. I think what also made me more mad was that I know EXACTLY what waiters are supposed to do and not do.\n\nI wish the reviews reflected what this place truly is because... we had a terrible time and for a STEAKHOUSE the service was definitely not up to par. Not at all. \n\nWe come to Vegas probably every 3 months (often), and give different restaurants a try but this place isn't to do so.And I'll probably receive a response saying this was great feedback for future purposes and that they're deeply sorry for the inconvenience.... well, you know people pay for good food, service, and a good time and \"sorry\" doesn't really fix the terrible experiences people go through CONSISTENTLY it wastes their money. there's a serious issue with this joint that management needs to fix"

Everything, if we would of ordered, came separate, the protein, the vegetable, the potato, the soup or salad, nothing came with the protein and none of the proteins were less than 35.00????? Potato was 15.00, vegetable was 12.00, salad was 15.00 if you wanted to add that! Are you kidding???? The place looked like it used to be maybe a cafeteria, not a romantic dining place and we would NEVER pay a price like that, all dinners should come with a veggie and potato for that price, Lobster was like 85.00 and that was JUST the Lobster. We drank our drink and paid and left, went over to the Pub next door at the Mandalay Bay and ate like King and Queens and the price was great! We won't ever be back to Tender!"

            "review": "This is a solid steakhouse with a menu that has a large variety of choices--something for almost everyone. I had a reservation for 6:15 and I was greeted on arrival by two very pleasant ladies.  One of them showed me to my table and it was the first encounter with the friendly and attentive staff that work here.\n\nI studied the menu online before I went and I had narrowed my decision to two choices, the Japanese Kobe wagyu A-5 filet or the wild game tasting of three game foods.  The waiter went through some special items that weren't on the menu and he threw a curve ball at me by telling me they had a bison tasting menu with 3 preparations of bison.  I knew they were having bison during July, and this sounded really good.  After some discussion with the server, I opted to order the Kobe filet as I have not tried real Japanese waygu before. \n\nFor starters, I ordered the soup tasting trio and got the lobster bisque, the heirloom tomato, and wild mushroom flavors.  The soup comes in a container with three small wells for the soups.  It gives you a chance to taste three of their four soups.  The lobster bisque was good and even this small portion had some lobster pieces in it.  The tomato was absolutely the best.  Very flavorful.  The weakest of the three was the wild mushroom soup.  I thought it was a bit thin and didn't have a strong mushroom flavor.  The runner ground some fresh pepper into each.  One small nit here was the soups sit on another flat plate.  Since the fit is not quite exact, the soup moved around some and on delivery, some of the tomato had mixed into the other too.  Points off for this on Chopped, I'm sure.\n\nThen came the filet.  With it were 4 pearl onions.  I ordered a side of fries to accompany the steak.  They bring you a small dish with house made ketchup and mustard.  A note on the fries.  Some of the Yelp reviews state they're not crisp fries and they're correct.  The fries have a less than crispy texture and they are oily and pre-salted, just exactly what I like.  I didn't mind the lack of crispness nor the oil.  It's just the way they prepare them so if you don't like fries cooked that way, don't order them.  I very, very rarely use ketchup yet I was drawn to try the mustard and ketchup.  The mustard was OK, but the ketchup was actually better than I expected.  It was sweet, from some small raisins in the mixture.  I didn't dip many fries in it--just enough to try it out a few times--but I was intrigued by how they changed the flavor from the standard bottled kind.\n\nThe filet was very tasty and tender.  I had asked for it extra rare, and when my server suggested \"blue\" I responded affirmatively.  It was done a bit more than I like but it was OK.  The only thing here was that on one side of the filet, there was a section that was very sinewy and I was unable to cut it with my knife.  I tore it with the knife and fork into a couple of shreds.  I thought it odd that a cut of Kobe would not have had this trimmed or would even be like this.  Since I expected the steak to be above and beyond anything I'd ever tasted, I began to wonder if in fact I had been served A-5 wagyu but being a neophyte, there was no way I could accurately tell.  Suffice it to say that when I finished the steak, even thought it was very good, I was thinking I should have ordered the bison.  \n\nFor dessert, I got the bananas Foster bread pudding.  Very tasty and very filling. It was a good ending to the meal.\n\nService was excellent.  I had Team 1.  I believe one was Raul but I cannot remember the other's name.  My iced tea was refilled regularly, one of the two checked on me throughout the meal, and two other people from the restaurant stopped by to see how everything was.  It was top notch service.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back to Tender to try some of their game meat.  It's a fine restaurant."

            "review": "Argggggh, where do I start??  Well, I just got back from a buddy's bachelor party in Vegas and we (8 guys!) stayed at the Luxor for the long weekend.  I had actually made reservations at Nobu for this particular evening but we had a fair amount of luck at the tables so our wonderful pit boss dropped some show tickets on us...oooooof, Carrot Top???  Nevertheless, we figured good seats and a fair amount of scotch would make even Criss Angel bearable and at least Carrot Top is \"supposed\" to be funny.\n\nSo, canceled reservations at Nobu (1st mistake) so we could hit the show which wouldn't let out until about 10:30pm and left us with dining at the hotel if we still wanted something decent for our buddy's night...steaks sounded like a no-brainer (2nd mistake).  As expected, the show let out late and we had to book it to make it down to Tender where it seemed like we were one of the last tables to be sat.  Did I mention we were a group of 8 guys celebrating a bachelor party??  Oh, because I did when I made the reservation yet we were still sat at a round table that should have sat 6 girls, at most, at an organic salad bar.  I digress...\n\nIt's cool, we're gonna have some amazing service and delicious steaks...oh no you're not!  Our main server came out and did his thing where he tries to confuse you into buying the expensive water by giving  regular water a tricky name.  He then introduced us to some of the other grommets that would be helping him out.  Keep in mind that we had been drinking all day at the tables but had definitely sobered up at this point thanks to Carrot Top...so if you're picturing a boisterous crew, we were not they...yet.  A few of us ordered a beer because we knew that wine would be the night killer after a large meal.  After that, things went downhill as we barely ever saw the service again.  Beside the fact that we were seated so close together that we looked like we were in a rugby scrum, there was no sign of a bread basket or anyone to even request one from.  So, that left the few of us that didn't order apps and/or salads longingly watching the other dudes once those were delivered.  \n\nOnce steaks were delivered, I was near boiling point but so hungry I didn't have the energy to complain.  Everyone at the table ordered a different cut of meat for the most part and I had the boneless strip...major potential.  HURT-ING.  Strip had no flavor whatsoever and I had to steal some of my buddy's horseradish just to put it down.  The sides we ordered (au gratin potatoes, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and mac n cheese), which we were told would be more than enough, were more like the sample you get at Costco by the time they hit all 8 of us around the table.  Did I mention we were sitting at the same table that little kids get stuck at on Thanksgiving??\n\nBottom line was that the whole experience was horrible, service was weak, food was lacking, and we felt very rushed to get out of there since we were one of the last tables.  Whole tab was a bit over $600 and I didn't even stay long enough to see it come out.  Couple of guys stayed back, one of which is a very successful restaurateur, to complain to the manager and he acted like he could care less (3rd and final mistake, but not ours).\n\nCalled the hotel that next morning and complained about the abysmal experience at Tender and they asked us how they could make it right.  The answer from 8 guys???  BUFFET.  That was the best service, ambiance, and elbow room the whole weekend and the prime rib was exquisite...muah!  \n\nDon't waste your money at Tender folks.  I've already read a few reviews that sounded identical to our experience.  Criss Angel needs to make this place disappear.  BELIEVE that!"

The back room is similar to old style steak houses in New York with great personal service from experienced waiters. \n\nMenu items; The Ribeye trio which is 3 different cuts of meat including bison is a wonderful selection. All steaks were tender and flavorful. Side note: Don't come to fine steak restaurants and order steaks medium or well done. A great juicy steak is prepared rare to medium rare. \n\nThe Tomahawk steak looks like something the Flintstones would eat. Both of these cuts of meat can be split among two people.  The fish choices were somewhat unspectacular however if you are going to a premium steak house, you should be prepared for the turf and not the surf. The grilled asparagus, mash potatoes, cream corn are all extra ($10 ea) \n\nDeserts: the banana foster was recommended and for a good reason, the rum sauce was simply great.

Tender is a third rate establishment with first class aspirations, but fails miserably and somewhat embarrassingly like Ted Cruz's presidential campaign. What do you expect when you're in the basement of the Luxor?\n\nDim lighting hides scratched furniture. Waiters being pushy on drinks that are way too strong and poorly mixed. Belike their target customer just tossed their giant neon drinking tub into the waste bin before cruising into Tender, but if you have any level of sophistication in your palate you may want to reconsider.\n\nStill none of that would matter as much if the food was even passable, but after tasting several dishes I have to imagine there's a huddled mass of culinary school dropouts and failed clowns pouring your dinner out of Sysco labeled shrink wrap.\n\nSteaks are overpriced with very low quality beef. Poorly cooked and the sin of no seasoning whatsoever - not even salt and pepper. Zero. WTH. Who hired these people? Instead they try to upsell you one of their crappy \"steak toppings\" no doubt to cover the total lack of flavor in their choice grade meat. The irony is that my ribeye wasn't TENDER. It felt like I was sawing through a warm garden hose.\n\nLook, this review may seem harsh, but you'll want to write one just like it if you make the mistake of eating here.

            "review": "If I based my experience on the food alone, the chef deserves a 4.  The buffalo ribye was served perfect.  Overall, the ambience was warm.  The service was satisfactory.  We had dinner reservations for a party of 5 on Christmas night.  I had trouble finding parking at the Luxor, but the rest of party made the reservation on time.  I came 30 minutes later after parking the car.  The rest of my party was seated.\n\nHere's why I give my experience a low rating based on customer service (this is for the restaurant management):\n\n1)  The young Asian female hostess at the entrance was NOT HELPFUL and very UNPROFESSIONAL.  As I entered the restaurant, I gave her my party name (Eliza G) that was seated already.  Her stoic reply was, \"I guess that they're back toward the left.\"  She didn't bother looking at her monitor to tell me the table.  I walked toward the dining area with no success for 2 minutes.  I finally found a very helpful blond female staff member who wore a red sport coat.  She walked with me back to the Asian not-so helpful to me female hostess who promptly gave the blonde employee the table number where my party was at.  DON'T PISS ME OFF when I'm spending $300+ for dinner that night!\n\n2)  When the very helpful blonde female staff member (KUDOS) took me to the party table.  I was met by a Hispanic male waiter who sarcastically told me, \"You're the one who's late.\"  I gave him a stoic look and took a seat.  I was already frustrated from trying to find parking and dealing with a lethargic hostess.\n\nTo the management, please take into consideration your customers.  I don't care for obsequious staff, just friendly service with a positive attitude."

We are two students but we have eaten in many great restaurants around this price before. With the prices we were expecting something amazing. But what we got... did not come close. To summarize I think all the entrees should have been 10-15 dollars cheaper, and still that did not excuse the terribly cooked seafood and the general lack of seasoning. The sides that usually come with the entrees are nonexistant: if you were expecting your steak with a side of potatoes you are going to be disappointed. You will be just paying for a 39$ piece of steak with nothing near it and for it to only be 8 ounces.\nThe Good: Service was great! Lobster Bisque was very good! The juicy pieces of lobster in it were delicious.\nThe Bad:\nHawaiian tuna appetizer:\nConsists of: A. the poki tuna salad: nothing amazing about the seasoning, pretty standard B. the weird ginger tuna thing: it is literally tuna dripped in honey and yuzu sauce, uninteresting to the palate C. sesame crusted tuna: once again not interesting, bland\nSeafood Trio Entree: \nThis was my entree. Consist of three shrimp: they were ridiculously salty. two scallop: you know that weird taste in scallops where it tastes like it just came out of the ocean and has that odd unpleasing flavor? this had it, I had to rescue it with lemon wedges. and sea bass: no flavor. did they just add salt and cook it or something? so bad, so not worth it. \nThe Australian Filet that was 39 dollars. Literally a piece of meat on a plate. Classy...not. once again as I watched my boyfriend get his single 39$ piece of underseasoned steak I could not help but think of how awesome the prix fixe menu at Ruth Chris Steakhouse (went to the Saint Louis location) was and how much better deal it was than this single underperforming piece of steak. \nWho would give this five stars!!! seriously I don't understand those people.\nnot worth it, even with the coupon. Please don't go here. There are better places to go in Vegas!! why spend 80 dollars (100$ plus tax and tip) for two people and eat terribly!!"

It was very delicate and refined. I was hoping for something a bit more classic. \n\nThe food was moderately priced for a steakhouse and pretty decent quality.

I got 2 different kinds of bread, not warm BTW and ordered the lamb shank with 1.25lb lobster accompanyment. The lamb was served with some type bean sauce and a sausage link that was bone dry on the inside. The lamb meat was tender and was easy to pry from the bone. The lobster was served in it's shell prepared in a buttery cheese sauce I think. I tried to save room for desert but all I could muster was a coffee after dinner drink.\n\nThere is plenty of staff around. Maybe too many.

I am thankful, as well as grateful, for all the acquaintances and friendships that I have nurtured and developed over the past five years.  Since becoming a more active member last year, I have attended numerous enjoyable and lively events, met many fun and humorous people, gained knowledge on the art of photobombing, co-hosted three UYEs, and established new friendships.  \n\nThough this review is about a restaurant, it's significant since my meal at Tender was with two wonderful friends I met thru Yelp.  At the same time, my main purpose of traveling to Las Vegas was to meet and reunite with old/dear friends.  \n\nAnd so, I dedicate my 500th review to Yelp, good friends, good food, and good times.  Now, on to the review:\n\na TENDER moment.\n\nTruly some of the best food and service I have experienced has been in the gambling capital of America, Las Vegas.\n\nMany thanks to fellow yelper, Rod U., for introducing me to his \"kitchen\" while vacationing in Las Vegas recently.  Located on the casino level of the Luxor, the bar area is inviting while opening up to the remainder of the spacious restaurant.  Though Tender doesn't look very grand or large from the outside, surprisingly the restaurant stretches farther within (as I soon found out after a visit to the restroom).\n\nSince Rod had dined here numerous times (and actually regained his Dukedom during the trip), I allowed him to take the lead on where to sit and what to order.  Rod's area of choice:  the bar, of course.  Now, for those of you who are not fond of bar seating, I implore you to rethink your decision.  Bar seating is quite enjoyable and entertaining to say the least.  It was clearly no surprise that Rod knew practically all of the bartenders working on both of our visits.  Mike and Robin stand out, particularly, in my memory for their outgoing and social personalities.  \n\nFOOD:\n\n*Tomato salad (shared):  A special consisting of various types of tomatoes from the Napa Valley served with mozzarella cheese and spattered with olive oil.  It was exquisite.  The perfect start to our meal.  Recommended if available.\n\n*Chilled salmon tasting:  Three types were served including house cured gravlax, hot apple-wood smoked Skuna Bay salmon, and cold smoked Atlantic salmon.  Absolutely delicious.  I'd order this appetizer again for sure.\n\n*Lamb Tasting:  This dish included lamb rack chop and lamb loin porterhouse.  Served with couscous and rosemary garlic lamb sauce.  Having only tried lamb once before, I decided to be adventurous.  The lamb was prepared well, and I enjoyed this dish immensely.   Cuts and portion size were just right.\n\nThe second dinner/visit with Rod and Terry K proved to be more enjoyable, humorous and full of laughter.  It seems its always a party with these two whether in Hawaii or on the mainland.  Of course, we all sat at the bar where we could engage in good conversation with the staff and amongst ourselves.  Plus, another round of drinks is quicker to order at the bar (*wink).\n\nFOOD:\n\n*Escargot (shared):  A nice start to the meal.  Small portions shared between the three of us.  \n\n*Bone Marrow:  Generous portion that looks intimidating, until you realize the actual portion must be separated from the bones themselves.  Very delectable.  For those that have yet to try bone marrow, take a chance and do try it at least once.  \n\n*Pork Chop:  I was shocked when the dish was finally set before me.  The portion is a behemoth certainly.  My fear was I wouldn't be able to make a dent after all the appetizers we ordered.  The meat was tender and preparation just perfect.  \n\nDRINK:  \n\nMartinis and wine were the beverages of choice for dinner.  An extensive wine list is available.\n\nDESSERT:\n\n*Espresso martini:  The perfect end to a delicious meal.   That is all.\n\n\nSERVICE:  Friendly, accommodating, meticulous, with superb attention to detail.  And I'm not just talking about the bartenders.  All staff we encountered exhibited such exceptional customer service.  Waters were readily refilled, rounds of drinks were quickly provided when requested, plates were cleared away and silverware replaced in a timely manner.  Appetizers and entrees were also delivered within a reasonable amount of time from when orders were placed.  There were some great conversations had with the bartenders especially, as they asked about where we were going and what we planned to do while in Vegas.  All the while they were also seeing to other patrons and filling drink orders for the restaurant.  Just an outstanding showing of camaraderie, teamwork, and exceptional service overall.  A job well done.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  A memorable and delicious meal shared with two wonderful friends, whom I never would have met were it not for Yelp.  Cheers to good friends and good food!!"

Both were kind and professional and made a point to check up on our table throughout the evening. \n\nWe got a half dozen oysters and a salmon platter to start. I really enjoyed the salmon platter which came in three small presentations: salmon poke, seared salmon, and smoked salmon. For steak I got the dry aged rib eye and was pretty impressed! It lived up to the name of the steakhouse; very tender and juicy. There wasn't too much fat which I liked. For sides, we ordered the asparagus for some greens and the lobster risotto. Asparagus wasn't anything special and the risotto was very rich and creamy. \n\nI would choose Mastro's or Craftsteak over Tender but I still really enjoyed my experience here.

Then another 20 minutes before anyone brought the drinks and bread. About an hour after we arrived on time for our reservation, we finally ordered our food. The rest of the evening went comparably.\n\nNothing that we had was passable for a restaurant at this price point. The escargot appetizer was completely chewy. The soup was bland, literally a broth with some apple flakes. The white meat was dry and the dark meat was full of veins and cartilage. Etc etc. I understand that this is primarily a steak house, but I would a expect a restaurant charging these kinds of prices to be at least somewhat competent with a range of basic cooking techniques.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about the place is that the drinks were decent, but they weren't spectacular.

I ordered the hanger steak, my guest ordered the trio of seafood. My steak was well seasoned, but I can't say it was worth the $30+ bucks I paid for it. My guest really like the grilled prawns, which were ginormous. But the fish was not cooked through. It was chewy at the bottom, so obviously left unfinished.

On our most recent visit we had the pleasure of being served by Emilio and Thom. They were so helpful and funny. We were using a couple of coupons and they helped us reach the required minimum amount by suggesting dishes for us to try. The treated us like royalty, which doesn't always happen when you are using a coupon! The food, as always, was perfect. The four of us had the filet, sea bass, halibut and wild game tasting menu. All were fantastic! The side dishes and desserts were also wonderful. Their staff make the experience so much fun and well worth every penny. The General Manager, James stopped by our table to make sure that our experience and the food was perfect. Can't wait to return on our next visit to Vegas."

Everyone in our party of 4 agreed we'd be back in a heartbeat if not for the music.  We spoke to the manager to let her know and also informed our great wait staff who agreed that if any music had to be playing, it should be classics and at low volume.\n\nAmazing food - truly fantastic for everyone.  I loved the bison sampler and game-based deli meats for an appetizer.  There wasn't a single thing from the soup and salad starters to the gorgeous deserts that we wouldn't pay for again but none of us are willing to do it with that shitty cheesy music going in the background.  I really hope they listen to us.  I'm no big spender but would drop another 500+ for dinner for four if the ambience were fixed. \n\nWhen we go back, we plan to walk in to check and if we hear that crappy sappy pseudo pop, we'll take our money elsewhere\n\nIt's really a shame because the food and service are fantastic!."

            "review": "I ate here one night with my wife and my mom on our most recent trip to Vegas.  All of the major hotels in Vegas have a steakhouse, and Tender is the one located in the Luxor.  When I think steakhouses, Tender isn't one that would usually jump to the front of my mind, but we had a $75 comp and were certainly willing to give it a shot.  It definitely had a steakhouse feel to it.  Lots of dark woods and dim lighting.  I thought it had a really nice ambiance.  We were given one of those circular booths, which are nice and cozy.\n\nThe prices here are pretty standard for a Vegas steakhouse, though not as steep as you might pay at Wynn or the Bellagio.  You can get a filet from anywhere between $40 to double that, depending on the type/grade of beef you want.  As with most steakhouses, all of the sides are a la carte.  They give you a bread basket that has a really nice selection of various breads.  It was quite good.  For our meals, we split a caesar salad, as well as the tomato mozzarella salad.  Each of us ordered the standard filet for our meal.  We added one side of potatoes for the table.  All of this was more than plenty to fill us up.  We didn't even have room for dessert.  The food was great, and the service was excellent throughout the meal.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience.  I honestly had no idea what to expect from this place.\n\nOverall, everything was very good, and I can't find anything to complain about.  We'll be back here if we ever stay at the Luxor."

When we got there, the hostess greeted us and told us they needed to set up the table and it'll be about 10 minutes.  Well the place had about 10 empty tables and booths(I didn't expect this bc I made reservations), so they told us to sit by the lounge area.  \n\nA waitress came by to see if we wanted cocktails, but we're not big drinkers and told her we'll order at dinner.  \n\nthe atmosphere was very elegant and walls and ceilings were dark wood with dim lighting.  the booths were nice and looked good, but it's never fun to slide into the seats.  At Lawry's steakhouse, the waiter pulls out the table so you can get in easy........maybe they should do the same here.\n\nwe were sitted in the booth and our waiter Chuck was very nice and patience with us..........as we took forever to order.  \n\nI ordered the prix fix menu for $39. and you get to pick either mushroom soup or salad with a balsamic dressing.  Entree choices were salmon; chicken breast or beef filet.  Dessert was creme brulee; cheesecake or flourless chocolate cake.  I choose salad, beef filet and chocolate cake.   Also, ordered a glass of cabernet savignon red wine for $19. which was very good with my dinner.\n\nthe salad came out, but no one offered fresh pepper on it.  I waited a few minutes and asked Chuck for pepper and he went to bring over a salt and pepper shaker for our table.  This was a surprise bc I would think of this as a high end restaurant and they should grind fresh black pepper on my salad when they served it.  The salad was very good, but was lacking fresh walnuts or some kind of nut.\n\nthe beef filet was just as I ordered it medicum rare and was tender, melt in you mouth yummy good.  the carmelized onions was yummy too.  I ordered extra red wine sauce to go with my beef, but it didn't need it.  They offer you several choice of sauces for your entree for an extra $3., but this dish didn't need it as it had very good flavor by itself.  \n\nThe flourless chocolate cake with a dab of whip cream was okay.  I'm not use to eating a chocolate cake with no flour, but it wasn't bad.  I just don't understand what's so great about a chocolate cake w/o flour.  This was the least fattening of the 3 choices.\n\nMy dining partner order the short rib ($25.) and ala carte yukon mashed pototoes ($7.)  It came out tender and melt in your mouth good and the mashed potatoes were perfect with it.\n\nChuck, our waiter who's been there for 17 years explained about their dishes and how they were cooked.  We enjoyed hearing the behind the scene of the restaurant.   \n\nOverall,  the restaurant appears be high end . there are several other dining room areas and the bathrooms were elegant with cloth hand towels.  Our experience of the food was good, but we were surprised at:  ie. they didn't offer fresh ground pepper when they served the salad, \n\nThe staff was not snobby and that was nice, but  Chuck was a friendly waiter, the others were very professional I thought and helpful.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant.  It's pricey, but if you want a nice treat...........it's a good decent restaurant."

If you're not interested in throwing a Ben Franklin and then some at dinner, find somewhere else. Chances are you would have already known that, since if you don't make a reservation, the odds are pretty low you're getting in. \n\nBut all this is to know what you're in for. Vegas, despite being sort of a piece of crap in many ways, does have some very high end restaurants, where nothing is left to chance, all the way down to the decor which is rather dim and inviting and features heavy wood paneling quite heavily. The food is generally outstanding and if this isn't the highest end joint in the city, it's in the running. If you're with a large group, expect a fleet of staff, including one guy who does nothing but explain what's what and also how to eat it, if you need that. Expect the manager coming over to earnestly inquire as to your satisfaction. Expect to tell him everything is great because it will be.\n\nThis reminds me somewhat of Spencer's in Salt Lake, with their meticulous attention to detail. The actual menus are different (I somewhat prefer Spencer's overall), as far as sides and appetizers (Spencer's is much better) and exclusivity of cuts of meat (this one has more of those), but they are still of the same very high quality. It's hard to isolate anything I had as less than very good, as all of it was top notch, top shelf and trying to choose shortcomings is largely just nitpicking. \n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the steaks or anything red meat related, including surf and turf. Venture into the other meats at your own risk. I also highly recommend the creamed spinach. Thank me later. The menu is overall pretty well thought-out and designed and the chef at the helm executes as near-flawlessly as I've seen. Every one of the presentations was magnificent. If you want the \"big night out\" and are willing to pay for it, this should be a definite contender (no pun...well maybe)."

The sauces that come with really complemented the oysters!  Delicious! For my meal I had the Maine sea scallops.  It was 3 jumbo scallops with duck bacon on roasted bell pepper and edamame quinoa salad\nwith avocado lobster blue crab pur\u00e9e.  It was AMAZING!  For dessert I had some type of blonde brownie that came in a skillet  and it was yummy as well.  My server was super nice and very social.  I am really glad I came here!"

On my last night and after having seen an advertisement on tv in the morning, I decided to go see the musical \"Menopause\" at the Luxor and eat dinner at Tender, also in the Luxor.  \n\nAfter the show, I walked through the casino and found Tender.  With no reservation, I asked if I could dine at the bar and the hostess staff were very pleasant and seated me right away.  My bartender brought me an awesome glass of Cabernet,  and let me unwind while I perused the menu.  Very lovely choices of beef, and some unusual big game kind of entrees for the more daring palate - I saw several items that I'd like to try.  On that night, though I selected a wedge salad and a classic filet - It was perfection!\n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant and plan on going again on my next LV visit!"

With working with Darrilyn we were able to make a custom menu for the party to choose from.\n\nThe service was incredible, we had a great waiter. Our drinks were always full, and he kept complimentary bread on the table at all times. \n\nOur food came in a very timely manner and everyones steaks were cooked perfectly--all 16 meals arrived at the same time and were all hot. The general concensus was \"this is the best steak I've ever eaten\". We all agreed it was worth every penny (of their very reasonable menu prices). \n\nI would definitely recommend TENDER to anyone looking for a great steak at a nice restaurant while in Vegas."

            "review": "Decided to splurge a bit at TENDER during a recent stay in Las Vegas.  We had early reservations for Tuesday evening, so we were among the first patrons to arrive.\n\nThe layout of TENDER is nicely done; there's a bar area in the front with the host/hostess station, and the interior is divided into separate rooms with open walkways between them.  The layout allows the restaurant staff to adapt the seating to the level of business; a room could be mostly seated and seem lively and bustling even if 3/4 of the restaurant were empty, or guests could be spread out effectively even if the place is slammed.  For guests, that means that you're unlikely to feel like the place is dead or like it's too busy no matter when you go (unless they are truly full to capacity with a long wait, which certainly didn't happen during our Tuesday visit).\n\nThe service was exemplary; we were treated as honored guests during our visit, from quick seating at our arrival, to unobtrusive but careful attention during our meal.  Our servers were very professional and polished; the effect was almost like having a personal footman for our table.\n\nI ordered the heirloom tomato salad, and split the ribeye trio special with my wife: 6oz cuts of the range-fed bison, the New Zealand black angus, and the Texas wagyu, all medium rare.  My wife ordered a side of creamed spinach.  I also ordered a Chimay Blue with dinner; it was a pleasant surprise to see it available on the beer and wines list.\n\nThe heirloom tomato salad was good, similar to a caprese salad (but without basil).  We were excited to try and directly compare the three different ribeyes, so when they arrived we sampled each in turn right away.  To my surprise, we both liked the bison the best; it seemed to have the most marbling and was both very tender and tasty, though it did also have the highest ratio of fat to trim off.  Conversely, I was underwhelmed by the Texas wagyu; there was absolutely nothing wrong with it, but I had expected it to be my favorite with superior tenderness and taste, and I found it to be similar to other cheaper ribeyes I've eaten.  It was still very good, but I couldn't find anything exceptional about the texture or flavor.  The creamed spinach was excellent as well (if you like creamed spinach).\n\nOverall, the experience was very positive, and the food was very good.  We enjoyed our evening and would certainly go back.  If I had to pick something that would set this place apart from a Ruth's Chris, it would be the service, which I found to be every bit as attentive and a bit friendlier (though of course service can vary from server to server).  As a disclaimer, we did not try any seafood dishes during our visit, so I can't speak to the seafood quality.  If it's in line with the steak, I doubt you'd be disappointed.\n\nI have seen many other reviews refer to the prices as unusually high or exorbitant, but overall they are really in line with equivalent prime steakhouses.  The prices at TENDER are almost exactly what you'd pay at the Ruth's Chris up the strip.  The menu is posted online, so you can form your own opinion before deciding to go.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you're near Luxor and looking to visit a prime steakhouse!"

I wanted another glass of wine and dessert but it took so long for anyone to come by I just gave up. I feel like if we're spending $200 on dinner for 2 people the service should be great. or at the very least average. great food, disappointing service."

I am an Mlife member and stay at the Luxor frequently with food comps.  I almost always use the food comp at Tender.  The service here is always great, and I have had several cuts of steak and fish and always been satisfied.  They have a great charcuterie and cheese selection, great happy hour, and nice atmosphere.\n\nSo, why a 3 star rating?  Just a couple small reasons.  The bar area is just a little too close to the gaming floor.  The other reason is I've never actually paid full price for a meal here.  The menu prices just aren't in line with other steak houses on the strip for the same price range.  I 100% recommend using your dining credits here.  You won't be disappointed... but if you are, the manager will make sure you feel like you are taken care of."

Started with two waiters~ one nice and one mediocre. Cocktails with cold bread and basil olive oil...yummy (just wished it was warm) .  Next up mushroom soup and lobster bisque~ so good! The soup had five kinds of mushrooms (including truffles) and tasted amazing (served warm...wished it was hotter) . Lobster bisque had good portion of lobster. Next up was chef's special: filet trio to split with accompaniment of duck bacon and blue cheese on the side. Loved it! We also had the garlic mash with truffles and asparagus~ very good. Tab was $185 and worth very penny.  HINT: Plan on $100 per person...it is worth it. Also, ask for bread warm, and don't be in a hurry. I noticed most complaints are the price and time- this is a place to enjoy and not be in a rush."

There were just some things that could have made it better.\n\nWhere to begin......OK, the food, that's always the most important in the end.  It was good.  The Salmon appetizer was terrific!!  You get Salmon three different ways.  The cold and hot were awesome.  The tartar was simply magnificent, and caviar, well it was my first try -- and I didn't mind it, and this is from a non-fish person.  Terrific way to start.\n\nI had the 12oz Filet Mignon, and Heather had 1.25lb Maine Lobster, to go with a shared side of Scalloped Potatoes.  Here's where things started to fizzle a little.  My steak came out over cooked -- asked for medium, and got medium well teetering on well.  So that had to be sent back -- the second one was right on.  Cooked just right.  But not a lot of flavor, or seasoning.  Reason being is that they want you to try one of their six different accompaniments with it.  Which half way through the steak I had to.  I did the mushroom -- which was good.  Just didn't want to have to pay for a glaze to go with the steak.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the bite Heather had me try of the Lobster, she didn't like that the lobster was already hanging in a sauce.  Which while she thought the sauce was not bad, she would have preferred to have a dipping choice.  She did like that they took the claws out of the shell when it got to her.  \n\nThe Scalloped Potatoes were fantastic!!  Caught both of us off guard.  Really good.\n\nCocktails were pretty darn good.  I don't remember what Heather got, because I was all too consumed with my apple infused Woodford Reserve on the rocks.  Simply outstanding!\n\nThe decor and atmosphere were not bad.  Nothing that made it stand out good or bad from any other high-end steakhouse I'd been to.  Though when the the fire alarm went off for a good ten minutes, and there wasn't anything said, or condolences made, that was a little irritating to be kind.\n\nOur waiter was OK.  He was nice enough, but wasn't around much.  Little disconcerting.  I will have to salute the Manager for coming by to give us a free dessert b/c of the steak temperature mishap.  Which was nice.\n\nPretty good place if you have a voucher like we did, and are staying in the Luxor.  However in the end, it wasn't good or bad -- it just was."

Even though I was a party of one I still got treated well which has not always happened in fancier places like this. \n\nAmbiance:\nThe restaurant was dark and quiet and it was exactly what I like. I sat in a big booth and it was comfortable. I was nice to have a quiet dinner in peace. \n\nFood:\nOk now for the part that matter most right, the food. I ordered the 8 oz Black Angus Omaha Beef Filet Mignon and the Lobster Bisque. I like mine on the rare side. I noticed when I go to a steakhouse that specializes in steak I can order it medium rare and have it be the way I like it. Anywhere else I have to go rare. Here I ordered mine medium rare and it was perfect. The steak was melt in your mouth tender. I enjoyed eery bite. The Lobster Bisque was amazing too. It was hot and creamy and had plenty of lobster in it. I really enjoyed my dinner alot. I ordered steak and soup only for dinner so I could save room for a little dessert. For dessert I ordered a scoop of the blueberry patch icecream. They had a great dessert menu so believe me it was hard to choose. The icecream was great. A generous scoop of icecream with plenty of blueberries in it. The one thing about the food that I did not like was the bread. It was cold and hard and the olive oil and pesto they gave you to dip it in left something to be desired as well. That was the only bad thing. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed the food and service here and next time I am at Luxor I will be back."

Fazel, a gracious man with obvious passion for his products and preparation, the story of Tender's relationship with farmers up north as well as the Chef's Midwestern upbringing soon had me all the more interested in what was to come - not even the frequently empty water glasses, 80F+ temperature, or ongoing \"beautiful,\" \"wonderful,\" \"excellent\" verbiage being fed to each and every table around enough to bring me down.\n\nWith the aforementioned oysters forgotten, course one began with two appetizers, and as one friend was treated to a rich broth teaming with tender oxtail, caramelized onions, grilled bread, and cheese that ranks amongst the best I have ever tasted my $19 slice of duck liver a true first glimpse of things to come - the foie gras' sapor more intense than generally seen amongst steakhouse fare with the crispy rice cake providing a texture-rich base more than amicable to sopping up both the offal's residual oils and a drizzle of port wine and juicy red fruit.\n\nMoving on to mains and sides, it was after some delay that seven plates arrived tableside and although presentations were sorely lacking, save for the young man who described the seafood tasting, it would be nearly impossible to find fault in anything save for mundane potatoes - the smoky bone marrow portion exceedingly generous given the $6 tab while both the crispy duck bacon and thick, cheese-imbued rice were equally well prepared, all of them dishes best shared.\n\nSpeaking to entrees, for myself the beef was a bit humdrum, though the sear and center were both on-point medium rare, while both tastings were every bit as good as the quality of sourcing, the whitefish admittedly a touch fishy thus allowing both salmon and scallops to steal the spotlight while each constituent of the wild game trio was peerless, the Osso Buco tender and full of funk while both elk and boar delivered on the chef's promise that even his leaner cuts were bound to impress, the latter particularly impressive as smoky saline notes met a perfect foil in housemade chutney.\n\nAt this point feeling the effects of a full stomach combined with the restaurant's toasty temperature it was in an elegant iced coffee presentation that I indulged while my tablemate fancied tea and genuinely unable to resist dessert the team at Tender had me at the words \"Bread Pudding,\" the sizable round swimming in a pool of boozed up bananas beneath slowly melting ice cream - an excellent dish its own right but certainly no match for the torched s'mores cake, an absolute stunner that was neither too sweet nor too heavy, something I only wish could have been said for a fallen-on-arrival souffl\u00e9 that was worth neither the twenty minute preparation nor the calories involved.\n\nFlying well below the radar given its gaming-floor adjacent location in Luxor, Tender is at once the sort of 'big meat' place that many envision when thinking of the typical Vegas steakhouse AND the sort of place where a largely unheralded chef has been allowed to carve out a niche that few would expect - if only the front of house could be brought up to speed with the team in the kitchen there is little doubt that this diamond in the rough could shine amongst the city's best."

We were seated in a semi-private room that had two long tables that could each hold 10 people.  \nFood: we were there on a Sunday and the majority of us chose the $39 prix-fixe menu which offered a good value: choice of soup or salad as a starter; choice of salmon, organic chicken or six ounce filet of beef as an entree; choice of cheesecake, creme brulee or flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  A glass of wine could be added for $15.  I had the salad which was quite tasty.  I had a sip of the mushroom soup--it was very mushroomy to the point of tasting almost like a seafood soup.  The beef filet was indeed very tender, but lacking in flavor.  I had to douse it in the peppercorn sauce that accompanied it.  The side order of mushrooms were delicious, as were the potato fingerlings.  The creme brulee was delicious.  \nService: TERRIBLE.  Especially considering this place is supposed to be four or five star dining.  First, after we were seated, a server named Chuck came out and introduced himself as our server and asked us what we would like for drinks.  Then he went away.  Five minutes later, someone named Ezekiel (\"Easy\") came out and introduced himself as our server.  What happened to Chuck?  Usually servers announce a shift change; they did so earlier at the buffet we were at.  Then as Ezekiel was taking down our order, he made a tasteless joke towards the bride-to-be (will not elaborate).  \nWhen Ezekiel brought the drinks over, he brought two of us the wrong drinks and there was a few minutes of delay until the correct ones were brought out.  \nAt one point after the entrees were served, I excused myself to the use the restroom and when I came back, 8 of the 9 dishes were cleared, including my 1/4 finished filet.  The servers were in the process of putting the unfinished side dishes into styrofoam leftover containers.  I asked if they had put my 4 ounces of steak in a doggie bag, and Ezekiel acted surprised.  \"Nobody told me you were not finished.\"  Um, Easy, it's YOUR job to ask if I was done with my meal and given how much was left, it should've been a no-brainer!  He kept saying he didn't know and that nobody told him.  I was about to throw a fit, but 1) this is supposed to be a happy occasion and 2) we were pressed for time.  \nWhen Ezekiel brought out the desserts, I got the cheesecake even though I ordered a creme brulee and had to wait a few minutes for the correct order.  Admittedly, the drink and dessert flubs are minor, but completely not expected at a 4 or 5 star dining establishment.  \nTaking away someone's unfinished entree is unacceptable at any establishment.  When that happened at California Pizza Kitchen, I got a voucher for a free appetizer for the next visit.  Here, he knew he messed up royally but did nothing to make amends.  \nI would wholeheartedly recommend against going to Tender."

In such an upscale restaurant,  I expect more from the wait staff.  We waited for approximately 10 minutes before bread (4 slices) was brought to our table.  When we asked for more, we didn't get it until after our food arrived.  Once the food arrived, we cut into the steak and the waiter asked if we needed anything else. We never saw him again until 15 minutes after we were done eating.  We had dirty dishes on the table until we got our check, and the pen that they wanted me to sign the check with was covered in oil that was given to the table to dip the bread in.... \nHORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!"

I would suggest table cloths and a dress code.  I didn't need to see all of the notches in the tables neither did I need to see young men dressed in Hurley t-shirts, plaid shorts, and flippy-floppys.  \"Dude, are you sure it's ok to eat steak, it hasn't been forty-five minutes since we've been out of the pool?\"  Oh the future of America,  sometimes I'm glad I'll be dead.\nBack to the restaurant.\nI ordered the wild game trio with a side of foie gras.  I received dry meat and no goose liver.  Oh well.  My partner had the bison ribeye and said that it was pretty good and well cooked.  Good for her, since we used her MyVegas points to get $75 off.  We also had the creamed spinach and the truffle mac and cheese.  I thought they were ok, my partner gave them two thumbs up.  If she wasn't lying here next to me I'd tell her to get her own yelp account.  But she had the coupon and she also has the \"Hey-nanu-nanu\"  and if I want to keep dipping my meat into her sauce I'd best behave.\nAnyway back to the restaurant.\nWe also had the soup trio: lobster bisque, onion and leek, and wagyu chili.  Chili was nice and spicy, the lobster bisque was more bisque than lobster, and the onion leek soup was not as smooth as anticipated.  We also had the short rib ravioli, they were good, but we just wished that they were warmer.\nFor dessert we had the trio.  Chocolate cake (souffle), cheesecake, and creme brulee.  The creme brulee was excellent and came with a flaky buttery cookie that would make a Dane weep!\nMy recommendation if you have a MyVegas coupon go and try it out.  I would suggest other options if one had to pay full price."

I appreciated how they pre-cracked the shell for me, as King Crag legs tend to be spiney and painful to open.  Their garlic mashed potatoes are to die for, and their drinks are good if a little weak.\n\nI give the place four stars because it took a good 10 minutes for anyone to help us.  The person that was supposed to be our server never showed.  However, we didn't have a reservation and it was close to closing, so I can't complain too much.\n\nConsidering the food we got, the price really wasn't so bad.  The Kobe beef can run you over $100 a steak, but my crab legs were $40 and my boyfriend's filet mignon was $40.  The deliciousness was worth every penny."

I cannot find it at too many places, but Tenders had it on the menu.  I ordered the Bison Ribeye.  \n\nAs an appetizer they brought us a sampling of different breads and edible oils.  The Rye was way better than I was expecting, and the sourdough was great.\n\nThen the Ribeye showed up.  I also ordered the green peppercorn sauce to add a little bit of kick to the Bison.  Normally I slather horseradish on my steaks, but they didn't have it as an option.  The bison ribeye was great.  My taste buds loved it.  So why did I rate the place as A-OK.  Quite simple - for $30 there should have been some veggies and mashed potatoes on my plate in addition to the single solitary piece of meat.  This would have been a 4-5 star rating if the meal included these two items in the meal.\n\nFor dessert I had the Banana Bread Pudding.  I love Bananas, Cinnamon and Bread Pudding so combining them in one dish was awesome.  During my trip I kept thinking of sneaking back some evening just to have this awesome dessert again, but sadly I didn't make it back."

After reading the other reviews on yelp, I decided this place was worth trying.  \n\nWe had to wait maybe 15 mins for a table, but had a really good drink at the bar, so it wasn't a bad wait. After finally being seated, we decided the wait was worth it.  They seated us to a very nice, intimate booth.  Right away we could tell this place was great.  \n\nWe started out with an iceberg lettuce salad, I had the 2.25 lb lobster, and my husband had the angus ribeye.  My husband requested his steak medium rare plus, and most places don't ever get this right.  His steak was cooked to perfection.  My lobster was brought to me in a covered dish, with a lobster bisque type sauce, which was delicious, even though I usually prefer my lobster plain.  For dessert, we ordered the flourless chocolate cake, which the waiters presented me the cake with a candle and chocolate \"happy birthday\" design.  \n\nTender is definitely worth checking if you want a fabulous steak or surf and turf dinner!"

We were told that there were two groups in front of us but that it would not be long.  About 10 minutes later we were taken back to our seat which was a large circular leather booth big enough to fit 6.  The decor ended up being lots of soothing earthy tones with the exception being the chandelier which was made to look like flames and I thought it looked cool.\n\nAfter we were seated for about 5 minutes someone finally came over to talk with us, give us water and deliver the dip for our bread.  We were then left to stare at the dip for about 20 minutes before our bread came out.  In the meantime we ordered the Mediterranean appetizer, I went with the 10 oz flat iron (medium) while my fianc\u00e9 went with the big eye tuna and we decided to split the truffle macaroni as a side.  Once the bread finally came it tasted awesome with the olive oil dip that had basil and sea salt in it.  Whenever my steak came out it looked lonely on the gargantuan plate only garnished with a sprig of rosemary and 3 little pearl onions.  The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely leading to a great taste.  I also tried my fiances tuna and loved it with the only bad part about her plate being the sweet and spicy accompaniment being too spicy, this coming from a guy who owns scorpion and ghost chiles and loves spicy.  The truffle Mac and cheese came topped with some shaved black truffle on top.  It was amazing as the Mac and cheese was creamy and the truffle flavor was ever present.  While I loved it I do think that it overpowered the cheese and I was unable to tell the subtle flavored of it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would probably head back her again in the future. All of my food was good and on food alone I would give it a 5 stars but the seeming lack of service at the beginning, especially for a pricier place, dropped it to 4 stars."

The decor is typical of a steakhouse. \n\nTo start I had one of the special a caprese salad, with heirloom tomatoes it was delicious. Absolutely perfect tomatoes and the cheese was perfectly seasoned. Loved it. My mom had a Caesar salad, she also enjoyed it. For dinner I had the small filet, it was good, I've had better, but nothing to really complain about, cooked to my liking of medium rare. The lyonnaise potatoes were ok, the wild mushrooms were delicious! We both loved those! My mom had a lobster tail, which they gladly removed from the shell for her. She said it was a little bit bland though. \n\nWe had a MyVegas comp, so $150 certificate. Our meal came to $149 before tax. So really not bad price wise. I would have paid full price for my meal no problem. In comparison, we did go to Stripsteak at Mandalay the next night, our prix fix meal was more than this... a full meal off the menu at Stripsteak would of probably been close to $300 so it was a great value at Tender!\n\nOverall a great meal, great ambiance, great service. We had 2 or 3 servers waiting on us, all very attentive. I would suggest sitting in the back room, we sat there it was nice, away from the casino. I would say if you are staying at Luxor or nearby it's a great steakhouse and worth the money. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here though."

The lemon confit vinaigrette was sweet, tangy, and simply delicious. Without asking, they split the salad on two plates. This might sound like a silly thing to highlight, but it was a great touch that made the experience more personal.\n\nWe got the 20oz dry-aged bone in ribeye, asparagus, creamed spinach, au gratin potatoes, bernaise, and peppercorn sauce.  It was all perfect. We kept defaulting to talking about how \"tender\" the steak was and laughing about it. Honestly, it was... \n\nI'm sitting in my hotel room destroying my left-overs and was compelled to write this review. I feel like this place may get some bad reviews because it's not your typical Old Vegas $6 steak in a cafeteria setting. This is a real restaurant that stands on its own two feet. The decor is sexy, service is superb, the food is well executed, and the menu is well thought out.\n\nAnd to top off the perfect night, Thomas brought us a dessert for my birthday! It was another fabulous gesture that made for an extraordinary experience! \n\nOh, and in their cocktail lounge, there's this random single chair that looks like it's from Game of Thrones.

Fatty pieces of meat (not in a good way, I love Ribeye fat but I swear they cut off the fatty parts they could not sell as a full steak and put this on this taster) and I ordered it medium-rare, as suggested by the waiter (I usually get rare). This steak was so rare, it was not good. I can't believe a steak house could not get med-rare. I felt like walking back and giving them a lecture about the doneness of meat and how to tell by touch. I can cook and serve four people four different doneness of steak, so I don't know why Tender could not get these three fatty, full of gristle, cooked to medium-rare is beyond my understanding. \n\nWhy not one star? We have very good service and tipped accordingly."

Both were very impressive, and classy as hell. The ambiance is old school mahogany-walled fine dining. Honestly it was exactly the kind of place to bring clients or someone you want to impress. I was impressed!\n\nI started with a nice Caesar salad. The classic \"feels healthy but isn't\" salad. It was great. Not too fishy, dressed nicely, with crisp lettuce and fresh croutons. For the main course, I ordered the filet mignon. They have a bunch of options on their cuts of steak, but there was only one on the menu that the suits gave me, and I can't remember which one it was. But I do remember that it was absolutely delicious. It was cooked maybe 2 minutes longer than it should have been, and that's my only nit pick. It was still awesome, melty, and flavorful. Exactly what you want in a steak. \n\nThe meal was wonderful. The service was very good as well. Waiters were friendly and accessible. Drinks were on point too. I was drinking Old Fashioneds that evening, because the place feels like the kind of place where you order a classy drink. I think I had 3 of them, and they were consistently perfect. Check this place out if you are really into steak and high quality beverages, and have some money burning a hole in your pocket (or can get someone else to foot the bill)."

Paired with the cheese tasting... 3 or 5 samples of artisan cheese with 6 baguettes, dates, jams, candied walnuts and a fresh honeycomb (would have made a nice dessert as well), it went very well. Our fav was the Purple Moon Cheddar soaked in wine and it was delicious. Other reviewers complained about the size of the cheese samples, but we thought they were the right size for a tasting. The bread basket was awesome with bread with feta and a pumpkin bread that were both wonderful and served with olive oil infused pesto.\n\nWe split a 24 ounce Porterhouse, which was seasoned and prepared perfectly with great flavor and had sides of braised brussel sprouts and fries with house made ketchup and mustard aoili, More then enough for two! We finished with a dessert for each and coffee and the bill came in at $150,"

Have the soup, then go somewhere else for the main course.\n\nThe steak I ordered was tasteless, I had to order a side of bearnaise sauce to get it down and I love steak; I would eat steak everyday if I could, but not from here even if it was free (which it definately wasn't).  And the bearnaise was tasteless as well.  If I hadn't enjoyed the soup so much I would have thought something was wrong with my sense of taste.\n\nThe wine also tasted like it had been opened the day before or maybe even the day before that.

Maine Lobster Bisque with Creamed Fresh Roasted Maine Lobster was silky smooth, with just a hint of a Sherry-like accent.  And a 10 oz. Certified Double R Ranch Angus Beef Ribeye Steak with Bell Pepper Sauce was perfectly medium rare as ordered.  The sauce,  a type I had never experienced before, tasted remarkably like Green Bell Pepper, and was very pleasant and complemented the beef quite well.  I just wished I had more of it to ladle over the melt-in-the-mouth meat.  But the Bearnaise Sauce ordered by Diane was so good it was drinkable, so my steak was not  suffering from any lack of sauce.\n\nBaked Potato Wedges were soft but surprisingly tasty --like giant, full-figured French Fries.  After a long break between the completion of our entrees and service of dessert, the final course, a Dessert Tasting Trio of Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee, Chocolate Souffle Cake, and New York Style Cheesecake, included a rather bitter Chocolate Souffle with Mango Pearls and Mango, but excellent Cheesecake and a very fine Creme Brulee.\n\nTwo waiters served us very proficiently throughout our dinner.  Our water glasses were regularly refilled, and the restaurant manager even paid us a call to see that our party of four was being taken care of properly.  We were made to feel welcome, and each of us enjoyed a very satisfying dinner.  \n\n4-1/2 stars overall!"

I guess that's what happens when you don't have time to go to Japan, Hong Kong, or Macau to have authentic KOBE beef. You think you can get by with American KOBE to satisfy your taste curiosity. But keep that box on your bucket list unchecked. \n\nIt was Thanksgiving weekend. We ordered the following dishes at Tender.\nFilet Mignon: wagyu Kobe-style beef, Dixon Ranch, North Dakota (boneless 8 oz) ($80)\nFilet Mignon: black angus Omaha beef  (boneless 12 oz) ($49)\nTop Sirloin: wagyu Kobe-style beef, Snake River Farms, Idaho  (10 oz) ($35)\nGrilled asparagus ($9)\n\nVisuals and Tastes\nSizes shouldn't matter in this case as long as good things come in small packages. \n\nIn retrospect, although we should have toned down our expectations, we couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed when the waiter showed us the portions. It's a piece of small steak, accompanied by a few drips of sauce and a tiny bit of onions. The dishes all look quite \"lonely\". By that, I don't mean exquisite like some French cuisine. I mean the chef who prepared our food probably didn't bother to showcase any traces of his vision of food arts. \n\nThe steak looked overcooked despite it was easy to cut through. It's tender enough and juicy on first bite. But the flavor was rather bland and uninspiring. I had better KOBE-style beef before and honestly think some sub-thirty-dollar steaks from certain steakhouse franchises can top this. \n\nThe overall quality of KOBE beef at Tender doesn't warrant their price tags.\n\nSince I'm giving 3-stars, I should leave this review with something positive. The ambience. it is great for couples who enjoy dining under dim lights as part of their romantic getaway."

The steaks were good but I cook them better on my charcoal BBQ. The side dishes are separate and if you don't order many you'll end up just with steak, a detail I didn't like.\n\nThe bad : the service. The maitre D was, well, I can't write it here. Fortunately she wasn't with us for a long time. The first waiter we got was all huffing and puffing, trying to impress us. When he saw we didn't respond to his machismo, he left us and a bored woman ended up servicing us for the rest of the evening, which made the tipping part confusing. That first waiter was point blank rude to drop us for other clients who were entertained by his sideshow antics (this is in Las Vegas after all).\n\nAnother bad was that it's overpriced. For example, if you order 4 different veggies separately (as mentioned above, like peas, carrots, asparagus and mushrooms) you end paying $40+ just for something to eat with your steak.\n\nThe ugly : the showy waiter stoked a group of 6 or 7 men nearby who were drunk, extremely rude and obnoxious, and not necessarily in that order. We could barely hear ourselves at our table. The loud waiter and the loud men at that table basically ruined our evening there which wasn't cheap. If it wasn't because of them, the meathead of a waiter who prompted the obnoxious customers all along and the b**** of a maitre D. this place would have gotten 4 stars."

With that being said, bear with my newbie-ness to steakhouses. \n\nAppetizer - Maine Lobster Bisque: A thick and creamy soup with several pieces of soft lobster meat. A good starter soup to warm you up for the next course. \n\nEntree - Organic Free-Range Jidori Half Chicken: Sooo, I didn't order steak. Yeah, yeah, I know that I should've, but I ate steak the the day before and wasn't expecting to dine here the following evening. But hey, wouldn't you expect their other carnivorous offerings to be exceptional? The chicken breast and leg were perfectly cooked; no dryness at all. What I didn't like was the filmy chicken skin. I just can't stomach the idea of eating thin, fatty skin....of course, unless the skin was battered and fried or roasted -- hey, it's a preference.\n\nEntree - Certified Angus Beef 10oz Rib-eye Steak: Tender, just like the name of the steakhouse it was prepared in. Soft to bite into, and juicy, no gnawing required. On the other hand, my boyfriend, who ordered the steak, didn't like its smokey flavor. Maybe my taste buds were out-of-whack that evening, but I wasn't able to detect any smokiness. Perhaps this might not be the best entree to order if you like your steak prepared as is, or with minimal seasoning. \n\nDessert Tasting Trio: The desserts were chocolate souffle, New York-style cheesecake, and creme brulee. All the desserts were delightful in their own way, but my favorites were the cheesecake and creme brulee. \n\nFoie Gras - I couldn't resist ordering a side of foie gras, which was served on a small bed of fried rice -- yes, fried rice, and being Asian I squealed with excitement in my mind. On top of the seared foie gras was a heaping spoonful of blueberry compote. The combination of fried rice, foie gras, and blueberries was divine; I loved every. single. bite! Plus, you can't beat the portion size and the $19 cost. Other restaurants would easily charge 26 bucks for all that.\n\nService - Fine. \n\nOther - The complimentary slices of bread were cold. Really?! Come on, Tender! Even the Grand Lux way down the street serves warm bread.  \n\nOverall - Not bad for my first steakhouse dining experience. Obvious tip: Stick with ordering the steak, or something other than the jidori chicken. Bon Appetit!"

This should have been a sign that perhaps there was a reason this restaurant wasn't booked during the busiest week in Vegas. The reviews online were very mixed though so we crossed our fingers and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, what we experienced was far from excellent. Calling it mediocre would be being generous.\n\nThe absolute best thing about the meal was the mushroom soup that I ordered. I read many reviews saying to try the soup and it did not disappoint. In hindsight, I should have just ordered 2 bowls of the soup and nothing else. Everything else was a disappointment.\n\nI ordered something on the \"special menu\" with daily features. It was a filet mignon (Omaha) that said was served with lobster tail. I was expecting a delicious filet and a lobster tail with drawn butter. For $95, that is what one would expect. Instead, I was served a mediocre filet and my lobster tail was cut up and mixed with rubbery shrimp. This tasted horrible. No drawn butter. The shrimp weren't even deveined. Yuck. Major disappointment.\n\nService was lacking. I wasn't even given a steak knife and had to use a butter knife. My fork was dirty and when they brought me a replacement, it too had dried food on it. Not sure how the server didn't notice this before he sat it down on my napkin.\n\nOverall, Tender was a total disappointment. The soup was amazing. Everything else sucked. You might as well go to Logan's or Outback Steakhouse -- and even there you'd probably get better service.\n\nSorry, Tender. I won't be back."

Please get some training to these servers! \n\nWhenever I have steak I always like to bring my own bottle of wine, when I made the reservation I asked what the corkage fee would be and was perfectly fine paying it. When we are sat the first thing the waiter says is \"you know you're going to pay for me to open that right?!\" ...um what the heck???????? Obviously! A nice steak house with that kind of service? Give me a break! I felt very offended at his condescending demeanor and disrespect! Our server knew nothing about steaks or fine service for that matter! He could see I was annoyed and essentially said the bare minimum to me the rest of the evening. \n\nHis original comment totally set the stage for the actual dinner, our cuts of meat where all ok, perhaps I was just annoyed from my greeting that everything just seemed blah. My wife's filet mignon was overcooked, my ribeye was actually very tasty but not the best I've had. \n\nThe highlight of our evening was the dessert. Wow! Banana foster plus bread pudding and banana rum sauce made and absolutely amazing delicious banana bread pudding experience! Absolutely the best. \n\nWhen you visit a steak house or any type of better dining establishment you expect a certain level of service to complement your experience, unfortunately this restaurant completely failed."

I can tell the difference between rice and rocks. \nIf there was a mistake on their part,  I would understand and even appreciate if they admit it. Blatant lying is another thing.

I was impressed by the meat selection, but the cut I got just wasn't good. It was a thinly-cut Kansas City Strip (bone-in). I love bone-in steaks because the meat close to the bone is great and very flavorful. Ordered medium-rare. It came out barely medium, pretty much well at the edges and MAYBE medium by the bone. I asked the server what he thought and he started writing something down without answering me. He acted like he didn't wanna offer me a new one, and since I was with a group of people who had to get to a show, I chose to just eat it. Pretty much just your average char-grilled outback-style strip steak. Except it was almost $50. Not gonna give them any more money, that's for sure. That server should've looked at my steak and immediately said, yeah, it's not quite right, let's get you another one. The sauces/complements were very good, and the New York boneless cut that my buddy ordered was fine. Nothing special here. Plenty of better options on the strip."

We were trying to think of a nice place to have dinner and were walking around our hotel before going up and getting dressed for a night out. We came across TENDER Steak & Seafood and figured, it's right in our hotel and the selection looked good. We went up to the room, changed our clothes, and came back down for dinner.\n\nWe started with the Trio of Soup which included tastings of the Lobster Bisque, Kobe Beef Chili, and Mushroom Soup. I ordered the Kobe Beef and Foie Gras Stroganoff and my boyfriend ordered the Bone-in Rib Eye with Mushrooms sauce. When the soups came out, OMG... these soups were amazing!! If we knew how good this was, we would've ordered two and stuck with one entree to share. My entree had a slice of kobe beef and foie gras meatloaf with slices of black truffles baked inside over pasta in a creamy stroganoff sauce with roasted whole vidallia onions. So rich and savory. My boyfriend's rib-eye was huge. The mushroom sauce that came with it was absolutely delicious. We also ordered a side of Onions Rings to have with our meal, which was nothing too special. Heavily battered and a little soggy. =(\n\nAt the end of our meal, we ordered Cr\u00e9me Brule\u00e9 for dessert. So yummy. Creamy custard, burnt sugar, caramelized bananas, and a shortbread cookie. It was so good that we almost ordered another one, but we were so full.\n\nAmbience is dimly lit, but nice and quiet. Service was attentive. There was a photographer there that took people's pictures. Not sure what that was about, but my boyfriend ended up buying a set which costed us $80 on top of our bill. Two picture books of two 8 x 5 photos inside. They were nice, but I don't think it should've cost what we paid for. I guess that's what you should expect in Las Vegas. Never again..."

Soon after, our servers Manuel and Tham introduced themselves.  Water and bread with the pesto Parmesan cheese in olive oil was delicious.  The menu has more than enough items to satisfy a steak and seafood eater.  Anyhow, we had the heirloom tomatoes with the side of bacon-the tomatoes were fresh, light, and surprisingly tasty.  The bacon added a savory element to the lightness of the tomatoes.  Our entrees consisted of the 8oz filet and the sea bass.  Sides were potatoes au gratin and asparagus.  We did actually have enough room left over for dessert and we had the bananas foster bread pudding; it was very good.\n\nIn summary, I really enjoyed dinner at Tender.  The wait staff was attentive without being annoying.  The atmosphere is typical of the old style steak house; dimly light with darker tones.  I do like that there was no obnoxiously loud music playing in the background... my pet peeve is having to yell to hear one another.  The food portions were perfect for me.  That being said, they will probably too small for you lol... The prices to me were reasonable for what you get.  We did have the MyVegas comp, and I think that made this meal even more enjoyable.  I've paid more for less at other high profile celebrity chef restaurants and I've paid less for comparable quality of food and service at other steak houses.  This is Vegas and it is what it is.  All in all this was a positive experience and one that ensures that the gf and I will be returning to Tender when we can."

We both cant eat rare meat and it was NOT cooked correctly that my boyfriend pretty much had a piece then ate off my plate. 1/5\nYukon mashed potatoes: moist, very good. 5/5\nGrilled asparagus: Cant really mess these up. 5/5\nCheesecake: VERY creamy, chocolate topping was very sweet, crust was delicious. 4/5\nChocolate cake: its not really a cake as much a souffle, very sweet and creamy, wish there was more of the break part. 3/5\n\nOn a brighter note, my boyfriend shared our experience with the manager and he comped our desserts but we were pretty much done with dinner so we declined to have the steak recooked. We had a food comp to use so it wasnt too much of a hassle for us but if we were paying out of pocket I would have been VERY upset.\n\nThe ambiance on the other hand was dim-lit, we had two waiters, one was good but one was very slow, took a LONG time for absolutely everything. They also keep your waters next to you in this little hanger thing so everytime the waiter for the table next to us needed to grab water or drinks for the table next to us, I felt like our privacy was a but invaded. The decor is beautiful but the music they play is NOT correlated well with the ambiance of a steakhouse, it lowered the quality a bit. I would not bring children, its a great place for small parties I saw many parties of 4 dining here, but it doesnt seem to be very packed....is it due to the quality of food? Who knows?"

I made reservations at TENDER to celebrate. The restaurant is located inside the casino.\n\nUpon arriving, we were told to wait in the lounge for a few minutes and they'd call us when the table was ready. The lounge is an awesome place to have a pre-dinner cocktail. Mohagony or Brazilian Cherry wood floors and walls. Plush padded-leather chairs and sofas. We sat here for maybe 5 minutes before they showed us to our table. The dining area had a more elegant & upscale look to it. Just by the look, you can tell you're going to be dropping some serious cash.\n\nI was trying to conserve my cash a bit for after-dinner activities (It is Vegas, afterall), so I ended up ordering the certified black angus beef flat iron steak and a side of baked macaroni & cheese. The steak was cooked to perfection! Flavorful, JUICY, lightly seasoned with just salt & pepper. And definitely TENDER. It nearly brought a tear to my eye. The mac & cheese was also VERY good. Torchio macaroni, smoked bacon, panko and white cheddar cheese. Definitely not my mom's mac & cheese. (No offense, mom)\n\nThe prices here are expensive. All good steakhouses are. And the portions will look a little on the \"smaller\" side. But I left the restaurant feeling stuffed and quite satisfied.\n\nThe service was also outstanding. The staff is friendly and courteous.

We were short on time, so we did not have the option to peruse the best of The Strip or even venture to Mandalay Bay. We had to take the best of what the Luxor could deliver. Mom was not in the mood for Mexican, so T&T was out, and Company Kitchen and Pub House was only serving a prix fixe menu on Sunday (weird). We landed at the bar at Tender noshing on salads, soups and some onion rings. \n\nThe $8 Garden Green was more affordable than some bar salads I have had, and it was nicely done with sundried tomatoes and artichoke. The tomato basil soup was a bit acidic, but I slurped it down. If I had been feeling better, I definitely think I could have gone to town on the onion rings with their splendid condiments: Scottish ale malt vinegar, tomato pear ketchup, and mustard aioli.\n\nThe service was solid, as everyone was courteous and quick, and given that the restaurant is ENORMOUS, it takes extra effort to be quick. \n\nMaybe I am getting more Goth as I age, but I really enjoy the dark, mysterious vibe, and Tender does it up dark and toasty. Dark woods, black chairs, including a furry chair that I might be afraid to sit in but enjoyed looking at, lots of leather and heavy chandeliers. I was completely sold on the atmosphere; pre-show drinks here would definitely be comfortable. To top it all off, Pantera drummer Vinnie Paul was enjoying a steak at Tender before HE went to see Carrot Top. He seemed pretty happy when he left, so he must have liked the leather too.\n\nThe one shortcoming was the bread. I did not like it. It wasn't warm or crusty or tasty or anything, so that makes me a little tentative about what the rest of the menu might deliver. Still, I would definitely give it a second shot, and I would be happy to lounge in the bar any night (just don't make me sit in that furry chair)."

Pretty bad meat, must have been the most active steer on the range. Could not cut the meat, was tasteless. Really subpar meat.\n\nService was excellent"

Both came out medium and tender as ordered.\n\nTwo of the side dishes were very good.  The truffle mac n cheese was outstanding and the garlic mashed potatoes were quite good.\n\nThe lobster risotto was a disappointment.  The flavor was lacking, the rice was too al dente, and the dish was pretty much cold on arrival.\n\nThe wagyu beef chili was outstanding, and had great kick.\n\nThe service was on point, and friendly.\n\nTheir bread and pesto were outstanding.\n\nWe would eat here again, but the meal for two, with one glass of wine was $230."

Working in the restaurant business, I know how easy and difficult it is to \"step up\" your \"game\". Tables needed to be refinished. But I wouldn't have noticed that if the service was excellent. \n\nThe hostess sat us at one table and then realized it wasn't ready for us and put us in the very back by the server station. There was one rowdy party back with us that soon left after we got there. We had several different \"servers,\" couldn't tell you which was ours or if they were a server, but we were definitely an afterthought, even though we made reservations. And we felt as though we were in the server's quarters. They were clanging dishes, making loud noises doing the normal server stuff that most servers do behind kitchen doors, in front of us. \n\nYou really pay for the service and if you are charging a certain amount, you should be getting that quality of service. They needs to take giant leaps forward... would never, ever return."

Our group ate (and drank :) in the lounge, and were treated like celebrities. I was so impressed when Adie and the restaurant manager both remembered me from my last visit 2 years ago. It felt like I was dining with family.  That is what I call true customer service!!!  Although there are many restaurants in Las Vegas, I highly recommend you visit \"Tender\" and when you do, please say hello to Adie for me!!"

Had to be the worst most unflavored steak I ever attempted to eat. It was the 8oz kobe. Was over cooked dry with no flavor at all . Best thing about the whole visit was getting out of there."

            "review": "It's an expensive Vegas steakhouse in the Luxor Hotel.  If you're fine with Ponderosa or lost your life's savings at the roulette table, don't come here.  That aside, I never eat red meat, but this place is the exception! Honestly, if all steaks were this good, I would be an incorrigible carnivore. \n\nMy husband always orders the exotic plates--wild game and the like. He advocates for this. I love my husband and usually value his opinion, but I would suggest that if you order anything except the filet, you are crazy.  They have an organic grass-fed filet option, but I went with the Kobe beef.  I plan to dream about it again tonight.  Side dishes are excellent and include the standard steakhouse fare like potatoes, sauteed mushrooms and asparagus.  Dessert list includes the necessary chocolate options like chocolate souffl\u00e9.  I am still not convinced that this isn't what Meg Ryan ordered during the famous \"When Harry Met Sally\" scene.\n\nVery pricey, but totally. Worth. It. Do yourself a favor and opt for the cheese plate as an appetizer. It's the best thing ever.  And make sure to visit whenever you're in Vegas!"

Admittedly, I am always somewhat skeptical of places such as this because I have been disappointed before- NOT the case here.\n\nFirst off the ambiance and staff are phenomenal, despite being connected to a casino. The waiting staff is well versed on all of their options as well as proper items to accompany with. I tried many things and not one was below par in the slightest, but the star of the show (surprisingly enough) was a burger...\n\nDefinitely not any normal burger though, I wont ruin any secrets but all of the ingredients of the \"surf, turf, and air\" burger are of the highest quality and it can be tasted. Without a doubt the best meal I have ever had anywhere."
