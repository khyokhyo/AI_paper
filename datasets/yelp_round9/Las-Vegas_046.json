            "review": "Soooo...Yay! I'm a fan!\nWe have been here more than a few times. \nThe time before last we had a nightmare service issue. We had a table of five and they were our closest friends and the other three had never been there. We ordered several cocktails, two bottles of wine, and most of us ordered tasting menus. Our server was rude, forgot things, was condescending and just an overall \"b\". Oh and I guess she could not run food because our guests mac and cheese balls were cold and most of our plates that were sat in front of us were for the person across the table. \n\nI promptly emailed the upper management and they responded with an invitation for hubby and I to come back. The return (again) visit was impeccable. \n\nBetween hubby and I we have tried everything on the vegan part of the menu. \n\nI will give you the info on the last dinner visit.  !See Photos!\n\nWe started with the amazing pretzel bread and vegan butter. Our server suggested I try the house made sangria which I had 2-3 glasses of :) Very sweet for my taste but he said it was made out of 12+? premium ingredients. Hubby got a blueberry lemonade cocktail.\n\nNext we split the vegan chopped salad and wow it was a big portion for half! Very creamy and love the citrus as usual. \n\nI got the grilled vegan grilled vegetable platter that comes with red/mixed quinoa. I could only finish less than half of it and so they boxed it up for me. \n\nHubby got the vegan double cheeseburger and fries combo. It's the famous one that comes with the chocolate creamy shake. Dang that shake it good.\n\nAs a treat they demanded they bring out desserts for us. We were stuffed but we could not say no. I asked for an espresso with a lemon twist and BAM! here comes the desserts. Our server explained they brought them from one of the other restaurants there! It was a chocolate torte/brownie and a brulee. They were both divine. (check out the photos)\n\nI hate that this (after sooooooo many times eating there) review had to be on a \"make up\" dinner. But wow they really made up for the one time epic disaster!!!! \n\nWe will go back there of course!!!!"

            "review": "Despite the deceptively ordinary moniker of \"Grilled Chicken Salad\", discovered was a surprising explosion of flavors from an interesting combination of fresh ingredients, albeit at a PRICE!  (LEER:  Muy Caro Se\u00f1or!)\n\nHad a few business meetings at the Wynn and Encore and afterward decided to catch lunch here rather than fight the cafeteria crowds back at the convention center.  It was a bit early and our waitress gave us breakfast menus..but we all wanted salads...and some time to work through to lunch.  We were lucky that they gave us a table just big enough for us to break out our laptops and work while we ate.  Definitely most efficient for us, although there was no free WiFi available at the time.\n\nWe eventually got lunch menus, but were shocked at the pricing.  $18 for a grilled chicken salad?  You kidding me?  \n\nHealth conscious prevailed and I decided to go ahead and get the chicken salad, and glad I did.  It was a darn good grilled chicken salad.  The mix of flavors and textures was quite entertaining...figs, sesame seeds, cranberries, pears, sea salt, fresh crushed pepper, and a perfectly seasoned pomegranate vinaigrette \"emulsion\" dressing.  Oh, and grilled chicken that tasted like real, farm-fresh-grilled chicken.  It's like finally getting a chance to eat what we see Padma Lakshmi and her peeps from \"Top Chef\" are tasting...\n\nWrapped up with better than average coffee.  Paid the bill.  Laptop in suspend mode...and then the trek back to the convention center for another meeting..."

The host and our server were wonderful.  They promptly seated us and made sure that the table was to our liking.\n\nThe appetizers are delicious!  We had the mac and cheese bites, roasted tomato bisque, lollipop chicken wings, and the grilled artichoke.  The mac and cheese bites are so amazing!  \n\nHighly recommended for a nice, upscale spot to get some small plates and drinks with good friends."

And everyday I've grown crankier and depressed as the day goes on bc I can't get them in NY. This may be a problem. For $21 (yes $21 calm down... they're more than worth it) you get crab cakes with poached eggs, asparagus and hollandaise sauce drizzled on top. You don't understand. I refused to speak the entire time. Every bite was heaven. It may have been one of my favorite moments during the trip. Needless to say, I went back for more every day for breakfast.  Total tummy orgasm.  During breakfast??! And here I was thinking such an experience was pure breakfast foodie myth.\n\nTill we meet again Oscar  ;-)"

            "review": "I was planning my friend's bachelorette party in Vegas the past weekend. I looked to good ol' Yelp to see what would be a perfect restaurant that :\n\n1. can handle a group of 12-15 girls.\n2. takes reservations (because we were on a strict time schedule and had no time to wait in long lines for dinner)\n3. be friendly on the wallet (since its already an expensive weekend)\n4.a cute and classy place to have our 'formal dinner'\n\nI was able to make reservations on Yelp via Opentable several months in advance. I didn't know how popular or busy this place would get but i figured, better be safe than sorry! Arrived in the nick of time to make our 8pm dinner reservation on a Friday night. To my surprised the restaurant was pretty dead. We only had to wait a few minutes before they set up our table 'to be more intimate.' Whatever that means. \n\nDecor was really elegant and chic. Lighting however was EXTREMELY dim that after sitting around chit chatting for awhile, a lot of us got sleepy cause it was so dark. (I'm talking movie theater dim) \n\nTheir menu wasn't huge but had a variety of stuff ranging from salads, pastas to burgers. I believe it was enough variety for every girl to pick out something appealing. Prices ranged from $20-40 which i thought was very reasonable.\n\nSERVICE. We had one waiter helping our table out and due to the changes in number of girls attending dinner, he was VERY accommodating. The only thing was towards the end when we were finishing up food, he was no where to be found so we had to wave him down a few times. \n\nFOOD. They give u complementary pretzel sticks with some kind of spread. It was good and flavorful. I ordered the Filet Mignon Sliders came with a side of fries which were really tasty and filling. I noticed that a lot of the pictures of food on their yelp page were not on the menu but i assume they serve different things for breakfast/lunch/dinner. I definitely would like to come back and try this place for breakfast/lunch.\n\nI would definitely recommend Society Cafe for anyone who is looking to find a nice, classy, formal place to have dinner without breaking the bank."

The food presentation and design of the restaurant were both beautiful. I wish the food tasted as good as how pretty everything was. \n\nCreamed Corn Soup: favorite thing I ordered. You pour the cream onto this cute little corn&lobster&sprout centerpiece in the middle of the bowl. \n\nFilet mignon: it just wasn't that good. The piece was quite huge so I couldn't finish it. Or maybe it was the lack of flavor. \n\n(However many layer) Chocolate Cake: the multiple layers were hard to resist. It was really sweet. And we couldn't finish it."

We were in the back area, and at the time, had the whole area to our party.  As other patrons arrived, it turned into a screaming kid-zone...  I never understood why parents bring their 7, 8, 9-year old kids to Vegas.  There's nothing for them to do there.\n\nAnyway, the food was amazing, albeit, a little overpriced, but that's expected at Wynn/Encore.  The bread were sticks of soft pretzel and they gave some butter with mustard seeds.\n\nWhen the food was brought out, the group that brought it out got everybody's order wrong.  The plates were correct, but they were going to the wrong person.  Very bad.  It would have looked better if he had just asked the table who had which dish instead of giving everybody the wrong one and then playing musical dishes with hot plates.\n\nI ordered the Fish & Chips.  The fish was very tasty, crisp on the outside, and melt in your mouth on the inside.  It was full of juice, actually.  The chips were okay, got too many of those little end pieces in a small triangular cylinder (for presentation only).\n\nThen, at the end, the birthday girl got a pre-arranged slice of 7-layer chocolate cake.  That cake was at least a foot tall (with so many layers!)  Our waiter was very nice and accommodated all of our requests."

            "review": "So, my husband and I earned a free meal at this restaurant after playing the slot machine and decided to try it out. Initally when we first entered the place, there was no hostess and no one acknowledged that we were there, we waited about 5 minutes. Once we were seated, it took the waiter about 10 minutes to come to our table. We ordered an appetizer and our food at the same time, it took about 20 minutes for the appetizer to come out and our food took an additional 20 minutes to come out. When we first arrived it was close to 3pm and it was not busy. The waiter never refilled our drinks or checked if we needed anything. After asking for the dessert menu, it took 10 minutes for us to receive that and once we asked for the bill, it took an additional 10-15 minutes. People that came in after us received their food and service faster than we did. This may have to do with us having a free meal or some other reason. The food we actually did enjoy but don't think we will be returning to this restaurant."

Was seated quickly in this cafe just off the casino floor. Ordered the pulled pork sliders. Got through the first two just fine. Bit into the third to find my teeth chomping on something hard. I removed the half-inch by 1/4 inch object from the sandwich. It was an OLIVE PIT. There were no olives in the slider. I told the waiter. She immediately took it to the kitchen. She came back and apologized, then told me that the chef said there was no way an olive pit could get into the meat. I didn't just dream that it was there! She asked if I wanted anything else. My appetite was gone, so No Thank you. Then the Manager stopped at the table across from me. He asked them if they had the sliders. They said no. He looked puzzeled and looked around at the tables in the area, including ours. My daughter was still eating her lunch, but my plate was gone. Still he could not figure out that I was the guy who had the sliders. He didn't go back to check with the server. He never came over to us to apologize. They removed the item from my bill, which was the least they could do. I didn't get hurt, so I wasn't looking for more, except for them to show a bit more concern.\nDamn, I should have taken a picture!"

The tofu florentine was on mini english muffins with a generous heap of sauteed greens and tomatoes. And a vegan hollandaise. Served with an arugula side salad. Yummers. Felt like a real brunch. And the french toast! The clear winner.

It's cooked in truffle oil which has this taste that I think is just drool inducing.  My friends and I were served at the bar since we didn't want to wait for a table and we felt we were a bit underdressed for the place although I don't think there was a specific dress code here.    Anyway we also ordered the slider burgers (perfect because there was 3 of us and 3 sliders)- came with fries, and also ordered the fruit and nut salad.  Everything was delicious and I do recommend everything that we got, but the salad you could pass up.  After sharing all 3 three of those dishes, my friends and I were moderately full with no leftovers.    One thing I could complain about is the fact that there will be rowdy casino-goers around and it is very distracting and distasteful a scene when you're seated by the entrance.  All of which has nothing to do with the service and food product served by Society Cafe, but just thought I'd throw that in there if you're planning a date or something more formal here."

I cancel the order.  10 minutes later, coffee cake arrives via another server anyway.  Fine.  My companion's omelet was delivered tepid  Bill arrives -- $20 for a $16 continental breakfast (that had been cancelled yet delivered) plus $4 for the coffee included but charged additionally, plus $8.50 for an unordered bottle of water.

I love any cheese, and I don't think that I've ever in my life said, \"Woah, that's too much cheese.\" I didn't think I had that limit, but apparently I do. There was a ton of goat cheese.\n\nThe potatoes served with breakfast didn't have much flavor, and the portion size itself was really small for the amount we were paying. And maybe I'm a little cheap because I'm used to places with larger portions and organic ingredients, but $17 for a small omelet was a bit too rich for my tastes. \n\nThe one thing that was truly fantastic was the Monkey Bread, which was a breakfast roll with cinnamon and pecans. My co-workers were nice enough to leave a bite for me, which I was truly grateful for. \n\nI wish I loved it, but I'm going to say it was just A-OK."

We usually head to the Venetian to eat at the Grand Lux Cafe, but they got rid of my favorite dish so... time to find something new. \n\nWe tried Society Cafe after we finished at the tables (I won big - $20 YEAH! That's RIGHT!!) when we realized that price-wise it was only a couple bucks more than Grand Lux AND it was in our hotel - easy choice since the Lux blew it big time (but we won't go into that. Too painful) and we didn't want to deal with moving the car and all that. \n\nFood was actually... delightful. \nStarted with those Mac N' Cheese balls and I knew from the first bite that I would be just fine at this place. Never did care for Truffle sauce but I almost pulled a 5-year-old at the breakfast table and drank it straight from the dish, no kidding around. \nI got the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich, Wifey got the Steak Sliders... again, really, really delicious. Nothing that my momma could't make but... that's kinda the idea. For a place that looks like this (suh-weeeet) I'd call the food very \"comforting.\"  We left full - so we'll have to assume they stay consistent with dessert.\n\nAt the end of the night our bill was about $50 (Cocktails are free on the floor people - get your water on at the restaurants and you'll save money AND feel better all at once) and our waiter was fair-to-solid, even if he didn't say much. We didn't wait for very long at all, and we got our bill when we asked for it. All told, this place is a win. \n\nCould be a totally different story if you have to share it with dimwit club-goers, but my advice: avoiding that crowd is usually a good move anyway, so why not keep that in mind when you're trying to enjoy something to eat. Go for dinner, skip the late night business..."

Light and fluffy and topped with a handful of blueberries and strawberries.\n\nRoasted Tomato Bisque-equally as good with a drizzle of olive oil, a fried basil leaf and a parmesan crisp.\n\nBuffalo Chicken lollipops-like a buffalo wing, but the end of the drumsticks have been cleaned so your fingers don't get all messy from the sauce!  Of course, it came with the traditional blue cheese dip and carrot & celery sticks.\n\nWould definitely go back and would like to try it for dinner as the menu looked delish!\n\nPerfect meal to tie us over until dinner!"

Yummy!\n-Presentation of the food - the food looks so pretty on your plate. \n-Free bread - You get a complimentary little cup of stick pretzels. Didn't really like the butter/mustard dipping sauce, but the pretzels were a nice way to start off my meal.\n\nCONS\n-Small portions of food. \n-The food is okay. Stay away from the $15 burgers. This burger is small. I would say it's slightly bigger than a slider but thicker. I asked for a well done burger, and it came out overcooked and burnt. My aunt didn't even finish her burger at all. The fries that came with the burger were also really mediocre. They tasted bland and were room temperature. I honestly thought that a Carl's Jr. Burger with fries would have sufficed.\n-The fried mac n cheese wasn't impressive either. They were little pieces of fried goodness, but tasted really salty inside. What a tease! Again, TGIF fried mac n cheese is way better.\n-Service. For the money I paid for my dinner, I expected top notch service. However, it took a while to flag down my waiter for simple things, like a refill of my iced tea.\n-Pricey. I like how the dinner menu gives you an assortment of price ranges for all types of budgets. However, the prices here are slightly higher than what you would usually pay for dinner. \n\nWith the low quality of food coupled with the mediocre service and high prices, this place is a perfect tourist trap for non-locals and starving drunk ppl walking to/from XS, Blush, and Tryst."

Although inexpensive, it has a magical way of satisfying the soul.  However, I must bid goodbye to the Sausage McMuffin as the king of my breakfast and say hello to the new heir to the throne - Filet Mignon breakfast sliders.\n\nThe name of the dish itself sounds regal. Nothing better exemplifies Vegas extravagance. For a brief moment, I felt like a high-roller - who else can say they had filet mignon for breakfast?  Of course reality set in the moment I received a check - $60 for two (how many sausage McMuffins is that?).\n\nThe line for breakfast can get long - 30 min wait when we got there.  But you can bypass it by going straight to the bar. The bartender, Robert was very helpful and even recommended that I put some strawberry jam on my sliders.  I don't know if he was pulling my leg, but he stated that some people swear by it.  I tried it and was better than I thought, but still a dilutive element to the pure enjoyment of a good piece of meat.  The cheddar bacon biscuits that they are served upon was very good, although it did not have as much flavor as I anticipated.\n\nWe also ordered the eggs benedict which was very decent with a perfectly made hollandaise sauce.\n\nThey also have many other signature items such as the frosted flake french toast that we will have to try the next time we are here."

I had been to Society Cafe a long time ago for happy hour and really never thought about them for a full meal. As an added bonus, the restaurant has an open layout so we had great people watching during our meal.\n\nThanks again to the staff for tolerating such a large, rowdy group. You guys are great!"

I was at Encore Beach Club and decided to take a little walk inside to grab an order to go.  \n\nThe bartender mention that they don't serve them in the day time, but they were more than willing to accommodate my request.   He also mentioned that I can substitute for a burger version if I'm not into sliders, but i was sharing with others so i didn't want to change a thing.\n\nSliders came with sweet potatoes fries in my order to go.  The fries were perfect.  No ketchup need.  The sliders were amazing!  Brought me back to a trip down memory lane.  Soooo freak'n good!  Funny how of all places in this city, Encore Resort is the only place i can get my Sloppy Joes fix. They're doing something right!"

Enter Society.\n\nThere was a 15-20 minute wait for 2 people on a Saturday morning.  That's expected.  I figured the food would be jaw dropping or at least saliva inducing.  How I came to this conclusion was the lovely decor, but don't judge a book by its cover.\n\nFood was just okay.  I had the egg white and goat cheese fritatta.  I imagined a nice juicy fritatta with goat cheese interspersed throughout.  NOPE!! There was just a little dollop of whipped goat cheese sitting a top of my fritatta.  Coffee was delicious, but it's kinda hard to screw up coffee."

We happened upon Society Cafe and the. menu seemed to have good options so the five of us chose to give it a try. Even though the restaurant was mostly empty, we had to wait to be seated, which surprised us. Once seated, we were given the pretzel bread with mustard butter, which was delicious. We all ordered light meals and were glad we did. The food was delicious and well presented. Our waiter wasn't very friendly and seemed annoyed by some of our questions, but the food runner was very gracious and you could tell he liked his job. While I was impressed with Encore as a whole, I'm not sure I'd go back to Society Cafe. It didn't make me feel warm and fuzzy."

Of course, like the Wynn, finding some cheap--Vegas cheap that is--food was thought to be an improbability, until I noticed an awesome little cafe with cheap burgers.  Admit two please.\n\nAfter a short wait, we were seated at an undesirable table, which we quickly switched for a better one.  Before we ordered, the waitress brought us fresh veggies served in a glass dish with ice and homemade ranch, then soft pretzel sticks with mustard butter (I've never heard of this before, but it's pretty much the single greatest invention EVER).  Everything was delicious.\n\nLooking around the restaurant, it was obvious that the place was pretty swanky.  It looked like Urban Outfitters met the Ethan Hawke version of \"Great Expectations.\"  Huge curtains with striking patterns, beautiful tables, fancy columns, even the dishes were amazing.\n\nThe burger ended up being a solid gourmet style burger, I was happy with it, but nothing to bring me back.  Except the price.\n\nIf this place fine tunes the menu and keeps the prices low, five stars are in the future."

It's located right off of the main casino floor, serves food for early breakfast, brunch, lunch and late dinner.  The atmosphere is very upscale while remaining a casual spot (i.e. you can show up in shorts and tees and catch ESPN on the TVs scattered throughout the bar and dining room).\n\nThe menu is American classic by design, and on previous visits, I've ordered everything from fresh fruit and a three egg freestyle breakfast, to turkey clubs and filet mignon sliders.  They have a lot of selections for breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, salads and a wide variety of entree options for dinner.  Every dish I have ordered has been very, very good.  They use quality ingredients and give you good sized portions.  And the service has always been super friendly and helpful.\n\nOn my most recent visit, they replaced the filet mignon sliders with french dip sliders, so I ordered those.  O M G!  These are amazing.  The beef just melts in your mouth and the slider buns are perfectly toasted.  These are a DREAM!\n\nIf you're a dessert fan (like me) you will love the XXXL Chocolate cake (caution: it serves like 3 people) and the fresh, warm donuts!\n\nOverall, if you're staying at the Wynn/Encore or just visiting the resort, definitely make this a stop.\n\nIced tea rating: 4 stars!  Delicious tea and plenty o' refills!\n\nPS - Did I tell you that they serve warm mini pretzel breads at the table?  OMG yum!"

            "review": "This was a really nice surprise especially for a casino cafe.  I was playing blackjack and the pit boss asked if I would be interested in a free buffet for lunch. That particular day I just wasn't feeling like having a buffet, some days I do but that day I just wasn't even though I have tried the Wynn Buffet before and liked it.  I asked if I could have a comp to their cafe instead, which they happily gave me and I'm so glad I did!\n\nUnlike other casino cafe comps which have a set amount you can request, they have a system and allows you to check in at the front with just your ID.  At the table, you're comped any beverage, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert.  This is really nice because the food is similar to an upscale cafe or restaurant in Santa Monica or West Hollywood.  The decor is really well designed, the first thing you notice is the red, plush sofa looking booths along the walls with a nice view out onto the casino area.  The menu has a surprising amount of selections with sandwiches, soups, salads, and pasta choices.  I ordered bottle water and iced tea (the waitress said that I could order both with my comp so I said sure!), and they gave me a huge 2 liter bottle of Fiji water which I took home with me.  \n\nFor my starter the salads looked great (the caprese and jumbo crab salads both sounded good) but in the end I ordered a bowl of their fresh butternut squash soup.  Also, they brought out these soft pretzel breadsticks which were warm and addictive and paired with this whole grain mustard dip.  \n\nFor my entree I ordered the lobster salad club roll, which included bacon chunks, pancetta, spiced mayonnaise, and avocado along with chunks of lobster meat on a Challah hot dog bun.  It was really delicious and I love lobster rolls.  The bacon chunks gave it just the right of salt and weren't flat pieces of crispy bits, they were chunky, meaty, dig your teeth into chunks that provided a contrast in texture.  \n\nFor Dessert, they had a whole different dessert menu which they change constantly I think.  Their most popular seemed to be the ice cream sampler and banana split.  It would be worth coming here for dessert alone to be honest.  I ordered the cheesecake brulee, which was so good!  It was a round NY style cheesecake with a really deep, crumbly graham cracker crust and that burnt flame melted sugar layer on top that gave it its brulee name.  Really great mash-up of two favorites that made me wonder why I hadn't seen that before. \n\nThe total would have come out to $62 had it not been comped, so I'm really glad I got that instead of the buffet which I doubt I would not have enjoyed as much.  Also for vegetarians they apparently have this vegetarian meal that's supposed to be incredible.  Service was flawless and I went away happy."

Nothing to write home about, but very satisfying for a lunch item; tasty and fresh.\n\n\nDINNER\n\nBraised Pork Shank: The sauce was somewhat tasty, but it wasn't the best meal ever.\n\nSurf & Turf: Sadly uninteresting.

Four people could not comfortably share a slice of this monstrosity!\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGenerally speaking, not worth the price, but their lunch is good enough for me to recommend. Try the tagliatelle, the lobster roll, and the cheesecake for a truly wonderful meal."

The first impression was that everyone was super snobby. The waiter kept pushing us to get drinks or water bottles, and he seemed really pissed off that we just wanted ice water. \n\n1. It's hot out.\n2. Water bottles are the world's greatest rip off. I am not paying $8 for a bottle of Fiji, I am not afraid of tap water. In the USA we are immensely lucky to have safe water, and I will take advantage of that! \n3. He kept pushing expensive appetizers on us and soups. I didn't want that, as I try to keep my calories/fat as low as I can when eating out. \n\nSo we ordered the vegan double-down meals. I was totally excited about that. The free pretzels came out, which were TOTALLY AMAZING. Each person at our table got three medium sized pretzels. They were very good and made the meal worth it. These pretzels distracted me long enough to forget about our annoying waiter, named Roger. \n\nThe people that were in charge of clearing our table and refilling water were very sweet. But Roger? A total buzzkill. Honestly, our entire meal was ruined by dreading seeing him appear again.\n\nWhen the food came out I was impressed by the portion sizes. I somehow expected things to be tiny. They use Gardein beefless burgers, which I don't usually like the taste of. They made them taste pretty great. The milkshake was more like chocolate milk, not shakey at all. :( \n\nAll in all, I have to give it one star. The service was just so bad I cannot bring myself to come back to this place, and that disappoints me. The waiter was so offputting and rude. He kept pushing water bottles and making awkward conversation. I almost felt bad for *him*, instead of us. I really wish I would have had a better experience here - other people seemed to.

I was asked if I wanted to get a 14-layer chocolate cake that feeds 6 - they could put writing on it. I asked if I could call back and have that added and I was told that would not be a problem. A few days after, I asked my husband to call back and ask for the cake. At first, they didn't know what he was talking about, but eventually said they would include the cake.\n\nWhen we arrived for dinner, service started off great. Our servers were attentive and the wait for the food was reasonable. Soon after ordering, I checked in with the main server about the cake. I was told they ran out of it but they would have someone go to the bakery they get it from and bring back something special since we were celebrating a birthday/engagement. Throughout dinner, the main server kept checking in with me about the cake. Unfortunately, there was some disconnect after we finished with dinner.\n\nA few people in our party ordered the filet mignon dinner that came with dessert (beignets). After our plates were cleared, it took F O R E V E R to get the desserts. I even had to ask about the cake again and the main server told me it was coming - it was going to be some kind of Snickers-like ice cream cake. After 30 minutes of waiting for the beignets, the cake was served. It definitely was not a Snickers-like ice cream and it sure did not feed 6. It was a normal individual-sized chocolate dessert. And the server did not even address my friend's fiance when he brought it out. I mean, after all, why should the fiance take part in celebrating his engagement?\n\nDespite the decline in service, and lies about the cake, the food was pretty good and I liked the ambiance."

It was defin good and the meat was very tender and soft and the BBQ sauce was not overpowering.  The fries are really good and its really good with the sweet ketchup its served with.  They also give you pretzel bread with a tasty butter! it was really good I started dipping my fries in it lol."

Well, it was either that or maybe my taste buds were overloaded with all the different foods I ate throughout the day!\n\nMy bachlorette weekend consisted of eating, drinking and more eating! One of my MOH made several reservations across town, but we decided to come here because of the decor and vegan options. Now that I think of it, the decor reminds me of something the Kardashians would dig! Very plush, regal and girly.\n \nThe service was great and the food wasn't terrible. \nSince we ate a bunch of heavy stuff during the day, I opted for a salad. My friend and I split two different versions\n1- Steak and Kale. Steak cooked to MR perfection. The only prob with the protein was that it was not very flavorful. The mix of butter lettuce and kale made it a substantial salad though. My only wish was the vinaigrette to have more oomph.\n2- Citrus Poached Shrimp and Octopus Salad- This salad had more components to it which made it much more interesting. WIth the jicama, fennel, avocado puree, carrots, cucumber, orange lightly tossed in the Fennel-Pink Peppercorn Vinaigrette. Bam! It was my favorite.\nI got to try a couple of my friend's dish and overall thought they were okay. The filet mignon, lobster potatoes and meatball apps were all (again) lacking some sort of seasoning. \n\nEnding on a high note:  The vegan pasta was excellent! Pasta = al dente. Sauce and veggies were tasty without tasting too healthy.\n\nAll in all, I would like to come again for breakfast or lunch."

They make some interesting but delicious mojitos (although I question the actual alcohol content in them ...) and they have a good selection of beers, bites and entrees to share. The bar area is nice, clean and the seats are sticky so if you get too drunk you won't fall off!\n\nThat was a joke ... I didn't really enjoy the sticky bar stools not because they were unclean but the material just stuck you to it ... hard to jump on and seat yourself correctly. The bartender was nice, and the service was okay (slow for happy hour). The food smells delicious and its a very chill environment to hang out in. I am looking for this place to definitely up its status once Encore gets going."

First off, that pretzel bread and mustard/sesame/butter they bring to the table... we should have know at this point that our tastebuds were about to party.\nBeing Italian, anytime there are meatballs on the menu, I am bound by blood to order them. I was skeptical because the menu listed horseradish (not a fan) as an ingredient, but honestly, they were little bites of heaven! Just the perfect amount of spice. Next up, sloppy joseph sliders. I'm really not sure why we ordered these, but SO glad that we did. They were so yummy I had a \"I'm in a food coma but I'm going to finish these\" conversation with myself. My friend got the fish & chips and he was raving about them all the way home also."

The Cinnamon French Toast is tasty, but not too sweet (if you push all the cream to the side).\n\nService is good.  Like others mentioned, they asked about food allergies.

If you frequent Las Vegas, you probably know or  have heard  about casinos reward their players with free room and comps.  All is done with the player's card.  At Wynn and Encore, it's called Red Card.  It's casino's way of tracking your play and deciding what type of offers and comps to give.  A lot of times, for the new players, there are special incentives for signing up, so check with the reward center.\n\nOn this particular trip, Allen and I stayed at the Encore.  I absolutely love the King Suite.  Hubby got an offer for 3 free nights plus $100 free slot play.  Pretty sweet deal.   I decided to sign up for a Red Card (player's card) myself.  After 2 days, I earned enough points for 4 dinners at either the Buffet at Wynn or Society Cafe.  We tried both and I must say I prefer Society Cafe better.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=Kyac2-vXGNdeMZQuCFyRzw\n\nThe cafe is located on the casino floor so it's very convenient.  We didn't have a reservation and didn't have any problem being seated.  Right from the start, it was very pleasant and the service was outstanding throughout.\n\nWe ordered our usual iced tea.  I was surprised to see 2 different types of warm pretzels with whole grain mustard butter spread served instead of the usual bread.  They were really good but I needed to save my stomach for real food.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=jjglIVhQ-WCrUrQXi_q0AQ\n\nOur first appetizer was Rock shrimp & crisped calamari - Zucchini Chips, Caper A\u00efoli.  The shrimps were big and the calamari were very tender.  I appreciated that they were just lightly battered and the lemon was grilled to reduce the acidity.  I thought the Caper A\u00efoli was OK.  Didn't even touch the zucchini chips because we had another appetizer coming.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=pFpEIkCdfXO3W3ICtGm4oQ\n\nOur second appetizer was Mac 'n cheese \"bites\" (Truffled Dipping Sauce).  Honestly, I thought they tasted like mozzarella cheese balls, good but not great.  If I had to pay for them, I wouldn't get them.  Nothing special for the price you pay.\n\nMy dinner entree was 8 oz Filet Mignon with Crab Cake - Potato & Bacon Cake.  Loved the Crab Cake - well seasoned and lightly crunchy.  The Filet Mignon was cooked perfectly medium and very tender.  I only took 1 bite of the Potato & Bacon Cake which was really tasty, too, but I was so full by now!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=nJYkjSUv7tXfNGDsroTkkw\n\nHubby's entree was the 18 oz Bone-In Cowboy Rib eye* - Peppercorn Rub, Herbed Fries.  He loved it.  It was again cooked perfectly to order, full of flavor and very tender.  He finished every bite of it.  Fries were good, but after the steak, he had little room for them.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=ZS4Yw0VKx583oSZ4hQ2OEw\n\nDessert came with our dinners.  Hubby chose the Mini Beignet which came with chocolate and caramel sauce.  They were light and fluffy, but that's about it.  They looked cute but didn't taste that cute.  I did enjoy my cappuccino though. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=puQdCgRvWfxWqBZMZ1_lSA \n\nOur server recommend I get the 14-Layer Chocolate Cake even though I said I was too stuff to have desserts.  He said 'Take it back to your room for later.'  OK, fine, I'll try it.  My jaws almost dropped when he brought it over.  It was as tall as my forearm!  OMG!  We took it back to our room and had it the next day.  Took a few hours to finish but it was delicious, light and moist!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=JMkl89IkwtMXP_-R2e2gEA\n\nThis maybe a 'cafe' but the food and service were both 5 star quality and the atmosphere was very casual and easy.  Definitely my kind of dining.  I didn't feel like I had to get all dress up to come eat here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=iPYKoxqF5SKt0Vrjhj9XMg\n\nThank you, Encore, for the comp.  And thank you Society Cafe for a wonderful evening.  We will be back soon."

The is a cute little restaurant that makes you feel like you're dining in someone's home, like a mansion type home.\n\nBlack coffee - coffee here is good, it has a dark roast flavor without the acidity and not the slightest bit of sourness was present. I liked the coffee here.\n\nCappuccino - the espresso was very aromatic, but I just didn't care for the way they foamed the milk here, I don't know if it was because I had a Flat White at sambalatte, but the milk tasted a little flat for some reason. It was still good though.\n\nUltimate Steak and Egg Sliders with a side of potatoes - This was really good and filling. I think it could have used a dash of seasoning; It is a filet, scrambled egg patty, and creamed spinach on a bacon cheese muffin. You don't really taste any of the creamed spinach, I like that the bacon muffin rounds everything out. The filet was tender and the eggs not overcooked. We ordered a side of potatoes. I didn't try it but my mom said it was amazing. She never eats not even half her potatoes and she ate all of it even though she was full. \n\nShortrib hash - I've never had any beef type hashes. This was reminiscent of vietnamese bo kho, without the spices of course. The beef was very tender, although I think it was a fatty cut. Served in a cast iron pan, I couldn't really see the puddle of fat in my dish, but I could feel it in my mouth.  Nonetheless, it was still very flavorful and I would order it again and tell them to go easy on the oil. It comes with potatoes as is typical of hashes, but it was new potatoes style and not hash brown style. It worked well.  I liked dipping my toast in it to sop of all the juices. The bread is toasted with olive oil I think, not butter. I couldn't finish all of the hash, which is rare for me to not clean my plate.\n\nService - was good, nothing special.  Beware they might ask you if you want all sorts of things to add, which I already knew was additional $.  Don't be tempted if you're hungry to say yes to everything, it's very filling even though some of the portions look small."

Let me just say this -- i'm a sucker for BBQ pulled pork sandwiches -- and this place had the best one that i've had to date. And god, I eat pulled pork sandwiches all the time! There's something super delicious about the pork. It's so fresh, soft and tender with the perfect barbeque sauce. The barbeque sauce was so incredibly tasty. Plus, the bun is freshly baked and super soft -- a major plus! \n\nI didn't try anything else, but my friends loved their food as well. Sure, it's on the more expensive side for what you get - my sandwich was around $16 - but hey, you're at Encore/Wynn Hotel so that's one of the more affordable places to eat."

The flavors were definitely enhanced when masked by the dip on the plate. They also served warm pretzels with mustard. The pretzels were good, but I didn't love the mustard and I love mustard usually. I decided to stick with eating these pretzels dry. For our main entree I ordered the ribeye topped with bleu cheese and my fella ordered the shortrib with lobster mashed potatoes. I opted to replace my fries with mixed veggies instead. The steak was good, but I felt that the bleu cheese over powered it quite a bit so I would avoid this addition next time. The shortrib was a little on the dry side and I ended up trading dishes with my fella halfway through since he wasn't loving his meal. The veggies and steak were the winners of this dinner. The mashed potatoes were good but didn't have a lot of lobster or lobster flavor in them.\n\nOverall, our meal was very enjoyable but I would likely explore other menu items on our next visit.

She ordered a bagel ($6), and I ordered a sticky bun ($6) and a side of corned beef hash ($6). Sounds simple, right? But all of the items were pretty disappointing, given how much they cost.\n\nThe bagel seemed a bit stale and rubbery. Sure, it was still edible, but it just tasted like one of those day-old bagels you find at the bottom of the bin at the corner of a grocery market. The sticky bun didn't taste fresh either. It wasn't overly sweet, which was a good thing, but it also tasted a little chewy -- not that springy, fluffy sticky bun that everyone likes.\n\nLast but not least, I pretty much paid $6 for a small dish of diced potatoes. Okay, it was about 95% dice potatoes. Where was the corned beef? I couldn't find much of it, and when I did find some, it tasted like that corned beef from a can. \n\nService was indifferent and he didn't check up on us at all -- just dropped off the food and that was it. The one good thing I remembered was the complimentary shot (well, tall shot) of sparkling apple cider. I'm surprised it was free and that they didn't sneak in a buck or two on the bill. Anyway, that was my experience here. If you find yourself at the Wynn/Encore and you're craving some good breakfast/brunch, just make the short walk across the street to the Grand Luxe cafe at the Palazzo."

I had the fish tacos, where were a mixture between fresh tuna and small crunchy tacos. it was the best. I've had their filet mignon as well, which was cooked perfectly. The cost of their food is well worth it, more so then other restaurants in these 2 hotels. I also really enjoyed their preztel sticks! The staff was really well dressed and very attentive, and could certainly handle a joke or two."

I liked the interior very much such as the black and white floral velvet drapes, the checker styled flooring, the dark leather booth. It had this classy retro feel to it. \n\nWe ordered the crab benedict, choice of three omelette, and the french toast. All of them were excellent. The coffee was good as well. The food was well prepared and not too greasy. \n\nThe waiter provided us with very attentive service. We were definitely satisfied."

I suggest ordering the Society Cafe burger, it comes with a large cup of fries. And if you're up for it, ask for it to be cooked rare. This ensures that the meat will be tender and juicy. \n\nI highly recommend Society Cafe at the Encore. :)"

During my adventure to Vegas the weekend after my finals (April 16-18th), my entourage and I decided to kill some time and satisfy our hunger by picking the closest restaurant to the nightclub.  \"You pick, Angie.  You're the one whose late birthday/pre-graduation celebration is this weekend!\"  We liked it so much that we ate here twice (the second time deliberately, of course).\n\nI ordered their lollipop buffalo chicken wings my first time there and the grilled Jidori chicken breast my second time for dinner.  The food was always on par, and the service was super nice.  I actually went with the Chef's Menu, which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  I shared mac 'n' cheese bites with my party (the truffle sauce makes it delicious!) and the warm donut bites were adorable.  The caramel sauce that came with the donuts were heavenly, but stay away from the chocolate... a little too bitter for me.\n\nEveryone at my table went with the Kobe burger/Surfin' Kobe burger and thought it was delicious.  My friend Henry had missed out on Society the first time we had dinner (he was late), so we rubbed it in his face the entire night/rest of the next morning.  He was finally able to have his Kobe burger because I am such a good friend and agreed to dinner at Society again.\n\nOn a side note, LOVE the cute dishware.  Also, order the tea they have; it's from Harney & Sons (love this fine tea brewer) and the honey they give you is legit!"

Service was great and our server was attentive.\n\nWe were given a basket of pretzels with mustard butter while we waited.  For starters, we got the mac n cheese bites with truffle dipping sauce.  It was excellent.  Creamy mac n cheese balls that are breaded and deep-fried then you dip it in truffle sauce.  YUM!  That went to my hips for sure.  \n\nWe ordered bouillabaisse, Scottish salmon with red and white quinoa, and sliders and fries.  They were pretty good but nothing amazing.  We ended the meal with dougnut bites with chocolate sauce and caramel sauce...nothing amazing either.\n\nI would seriously have to come back here for brunch.

We got right in about 730pm for dinner. The decor is paisley and striped; regal and upscale/upbeat. Very 'Wynn--esque'. My mom had a Cosmo to start and my boyfriend a blackberry margarita, that was muddled with fresh berries. I only had a taste of his drink, as I could not drink on this weekend. It was fresh and light. Just what one needs as a pre-dinner cocktail in Las Vegas. I ordered a watermelon/cheese/balsamic salad to start; I wasn't sure I could eat much more. For a 'salad', it was an ample amount. I loved it so much, I'm gonna try and mimic it at home. It was perfect for the taste buds. My boyfriend started with tomato soup; since I'm not really a tomato soup fan, I did not have an opinion, but he raved about it. My mom had a Caesar salad and loved the lightness of it; not heavy on dressing, which seems to be usual on this salad at other places. We split a charcuterie board that was loaded with fresh, sliced baguette ; four cheeses and three meats including a pate and prosciutto and salami. It came with a mustard, orange chutney; olives and pickles. Between us, we were unable to finish it. At $29 for the board, it's well worth it! The menu has a prix fixe option; had we been into a more robust meal, we would have tried it out; it was a steal for 3 courses at $42. Our service was nice and at times, a little slow ; but we enjoy being foodies and not being rushed, so it didn't bother us a bit! It's considered a 2$ sign for The Wynn; a good way to have trendy, hip meal without breaking the rest of the budget."

I made a reservation for 9pm as we did some last minute errands & got ready for our extravagant Saturday night rendezvous. \n\nLimo driver, you're FIRED for dropping us off at the Wynn entrance. Oh well, I guess we could use the walk through the casino from indulging in the sinful meal we were about to consume. Upon arrival, we checked in at the host stand and waited an additional 10 minutes to be seated. No biggie.\n\nService was nice and professional. She took care of us but we could have definitely seen her more often. It's all good though since we were graced with the presence of the \"food runner/server assistant\" to grab dishes off our table. Now for the food.. our table ordered several different menu items as well as some chef specials. Let me tell you what was a hit and what was a miss during our Saturday night visit (excuse me for not knowing the real names)..\n\nHIT: \n*Fried Mac & Cheese: the truffle dipping sauce was amazing!\n*Beet Salad w/goat cheese: Yes, its tiny but the warm goat cheese hit the spot\n*Caprese Salad\n*Filet Mignon w/Bearnaise sauce: top notch filet but the Bearnaise wasn't as exquisite as I'd like it to be\n\nNot very good:\n*Vegan burger: it was just real plain and not very fancy for being here\n*Mushroom Pasta: two friends got this dish & said it was not good and very buttery- BLAH!\n*Lollipop chicken wings: ehhh! Not worth the 12 bucks\n\nThose dishes were worth mentioning for your reference. Anywho, I do like this place even though my main entree wasn't very yummy. Next time I'll have to try another option on the vegan menu or stop by during Happy Hour!"

I hyped it up in my head because of it receiving an award as one of the best new restaurants in the country for 2009, I really wanted to like you Society, but your staff killed it for you. \n\nI ate here before seeing Le Reve (which I also reviewed) with a friend of mine. The first thing we noticed was that the decor of this place is very well done. It carries a black and white theme with an awesome olive green accent prevalent everywhere from the mosaic tile floors, to the walls, and the ceiling. I'm going to take that great design and apply it in my own home. \n\nAs I mentioned above, though, our waiter killed the experience. It was difficult enough to get more water, it's a good thing he never asked us if we wanted a drink besides water, because it may have never come. He never asked how our meal was or if we needed anything, and he wasn't even the one who brought our food to our table. I expect better, especially from a resort that throws its ratings in your face telling you how awesome it is at being awesome!\n\nFor the meal, I had the American Kobe Beef Hamburger. I've never had kobe beef before, and really wasn't quite sure what the big deal was. Maybe it was because the hamburger bun was a little dry, but I just wasn't impressed. The fries were good, though. Overall the food was decent but I would try something different if I go back. \n\nBasically, the only thing that really stood out about this place was the awesome decor, otherwise, I don't see how this was rated one of the best new restaurants in America in 2009. Must not have been that many opening with the recession!"

Considering that my bf and I were staying at the Encore, I figured to save time and energy, I'd look at the restaurants at the Encore. I came across this place, and found some delicious items for breakfast. I initially found Frosted Flakes French Toast, and pitched it to my bf (at the time). It didn't take him long to make a decision about this fancy french toast. I found some Eggs Benedict, and I was hoping that I would make a substitution for Canadian bacon for Smoked Salmon. \n\nWell, when we were there, I asked for the substitution, it worked. The waitress thought that sounded delicious, and even the server said it smelled really good. So I guess no one has ever ordered it that way, or never thought of trying it that way. I love Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon - it's much better than Canadian bacon. Also, they didn't charge extra for the substitution. \n\nThe amount of food was just perfect, I eat rather lightly for breakfast, and the little mounds of eggy/salmon/english muffin were just perfect. It's a bit pricey, but completely worth it. We had a credit - so we just charged it to the room. It's just too bad that we would have to trek all the way back to Vegas to get the french toast's/benedict - but that's okay. :) \n\nThe decor was just beautiful, and it's chic-casual.

But both my entr\u00e9e and my wife's entr\u00e9e were just okay. Actually Wifey said her fish was too salty. She told the waitress - who grazed by twice - but never asked until we were full - how our dinner was, and the girl replied, \"Really?, when I order it - it is perfect.\" ...HUH? We are not talking about your order, young trick. \n\nMy \"Filet\" sliders - included such a thin, small piece of beef that it could have been ball steak. The onions were obviously pre-made and they were smushy (and there was way too much of them). \n\nDinner for two was $100 w/ tip. We would NEVER go back here for dinner. I would sit at the bar and order that yummy calamari, rock shrimp & pepper appetizer."

It's a beautiful room, with deep reds and greens, lush drapes, over-sized couches serve as banquettes for dining, and a good mix of people (not just Vegas hipsters). \n\nThe menu could be described as American comfort food, but with a slightly different interpretation. \n\nGood soups, including a classic split pea, but with franks instead of ham (it works). \n\nComplimentary freshly baked pretzels shaped like mini baguettes, served with a mustard/butter spread was surprisingly good. Homemade potato chips with a high end onion dip (no Lipton soup mix here). \n\nGreat cocktails--and large. About 3x the size of a standard cocktail. \n\nI had the 3 quiches (yes, I am a real man), which were very good. I saw the waitstaff bringing out very vertical hamburgers which look amazing. \n\nExcellent service by Roberto, and a pleasant lunch. There was a 20 minute wait out front, but one of the managers brought out mango smoothies for those waiting in line. Nice touch and keeps everyone's blood sugar steady to be patient for a table. \n\nOut of all the restaurants at Encore or the Wynn, this is probably one of the most casual, but the food, service and experience are all high end."

I liked the cook on the sirloin and it did taste like quality beef, but the overall concoction was much too heavy for brunch. The bread on the outside was even fried (I believe?), and it felt like a heart attack slider. I might order these again as a late-night munchie, but perhaps not as a breakfast or brunch dish..\n\nEgg white frittata with goat cheese:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dzq0RXzFcYAU-eZEYAosnw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nThe egg white frittata was cooked very well, as egg whites have a tendency to harden very quickly, but these were still soft and springy. The goat cheese was maybe what kept the frittata soft, but I couldn't taste too much of a distinct flavor. There was a nice ratio of filling to egg whites, and it was a pretty generous portion. \n\nSouffle pancakes:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=c7ZzGBK0KKXSMdNuApwbUw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nI haven't ventured too far into pancake territory, as I'm usually a French toast addict, but the addition of \"souffle\" was too tempting to resist. The pancakes themselves were very well-shaped, and I was surprised by how stiff they seemed on the outside. The interior was a little too dense for me to say that it was similar to a souffle, but the adjusted sweetness of the pancake was palatable. \n\nSociety Cafe Encore was my last stop in Las Vegas before heading home, and it wasn't a bad meal to leave on. I would be open to venturing back to try some other dishes next time."

I had the ultimate steak and egg sliders.  These come 2 to an order, but they aren't small.  You may need a side of fruit or potatoes, I would recommend either.  But, the sliders don't disappoint.  Served on a bacon cheddar muffin, it's basically a steakhouse on a bun.  You get a slice of filet with eggs scrambled with herbs.  But, the component that brings it all together is the creamed spinach.  This adds so much to the dish and really gives it the steakhouse feel.  Highly recommended.\n\nThe wife had the 2 egg breakfast, which isn't cheap, but then again, you are at Encore.  You get a good amount of ham with the breakfast, and I LOVED the potatoes.  They are home fries, sort of.  They were soft and had excellent flavor, seasoned very well.  Next time I eat here I'll definitely get a side for myself.\n\nService was good, but not spectacular.

It was overcooked and topped off with a squirt of lemon. \n\nUnfortunately, I had to force the salmon down my throat because I was about to do some heavy drinking at XS. \n\nAll in all, the salmon was not worth the price I paid. I should've stucked with a burger instead."

From the moment we walked in service was excellent. My wife and I ordered mac and cheese balls and meatballs for the table. Great flavors, but the meatballs could've been hotter. Finished of with a Caesar salad for her and a Bacon and Bibb salad for me. Pretty damn good.

Wynn really, really has it going on for us vegans. \n\nI heard through the grapevine that multiple outlets in the Wynn now serve s fast food-esque meal - cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake made with coconut milk ice cream. And it's $9. Upon hearing this, my husband and I practically ran out of the door. \n\nWith a recommendation from a friend, we decided to try this meal out at Society Cafe. It has an open atmosphere to which you can people-watch which is fun. The seating and design of the cafe is impeccable - gigantic, bright pink sofas, black & white, and soft lime green is a very soothing yet hip palette to me. When we walked up to the hostess, she immediately asked us if we wanted a vegan menu. Very nice that I didn't have to ask! We were seated and greeted by our server Michel, who upon hearing our order exclaimed with genuine delight that we were really going to enjoy our meal. This made me even more excited! He also automatically told us he would bring out vegan bread and butter. Upon doing so he remembered a second kind of bread, some pretzel sticks, were also vegan which he brought out too! Great customer service for sure. \n\nThe fast food meal was adorable. The cheeseburger (which looked like a 100% doppelg\u00e4nger for a certain famous golden-arched restaurant's burger) was wrapped up in foil; the fries were in a cardboard sleeve. The two hot items were in a cardboard half-box, all served on top of a white rectangular plate. And the chocolate shake was in a Wynn plastic cup with a really thick straw which was great for drinking. The burger I adored, although I passed off the pickles to the husband. I think the Gardein patty might have been slightly overcooked, or it might need some light seasoning... it wasn't as juicy as it could have been, and was a little bland, but overall I liked it; I really want to know what kind of \"cheese\" they used! The fries were delicious, and the milkshake was TO DIE FOR. I could seriously have that every single day. IN LOVE! \n\nThe meal was beyond delightful, and the customer service was wonderful to boot. Michel really made the experience pleasurable, and answered every question quite knowledgeably. Even when he wasn't sure, he asked and got back to us in a very timely manner. We asked him about a dessert area in another part of the hotel to which he got the hostess (her name escapes me, but she was brilliant) who divulged that she was a vegetarian and tried her best to get us some answers, and spent some time chatting with us. She was very nice and extremely helpful and both her and Michel went above and beyond to make our meal lovely. \n\nI think this might start to be a weekly thing for me. Not only is this meal affordable, but the Wynn has really turned into a haven for vegans. Not once did I get an eye-roll, or was made to feel like I was annoying or asking too much. I felt really accepted at this restaurant, and I love that even the staff enjoys the food and can really talk to it with their customers. Society Cafe really pulled out all of the stops even for our humble meal, and I can't wait to come back for more!"

Made a reservation for 7pm, but we were early so had to wait a bit.\n\nThe prix fixe dinner was a Kabocha Squash Soup and Slow-Roasted Free Range Turkey with pancetta and sage stuffing, mashed potato, root vegetables and cranberry compote. The included dessert would have been a pumpkin tart, but they ran out. Instead they offered donut bites, which felt oddly unequal to the promised pumpkin tart, so we skipped it.\n\nThe soup was very creamy and delicious. To go along with the soup we were given some pretzel bites and some kind of mustard butter that tasted fantastic. The turkey tasted good, but there wasn't enough gravy. \n\nTo my disappointment the restaurant sits right next to the casino floor. The pictures on their site make the atmosphere look much more secluded and interesting. Unfortunately you can still hear all of the slot machines beeping and dinging away, so it isn't the most pleasant dining experience.\n\nSo the food was good, but overall the experience wasn't that great. If you want dinner for a special occasion, go elsewhere."

It just happened to be Vegas restaurant week and this was one of the restaurants participating in it. For $40 we got an appetizer dish, a main course, a dessert and a beer.\n\nFirst we got a few pretzel sticks with a mustard like butter. It was pretty good because the pretzels were still warm. For the appetizer I got the mussels, and I felt they way over salted them. I couldn't taste much of the flavor because the sauce tasted like it was drowning in sodium and the bread didn't help much either.\n\nFor the main course I got the BBQ board, which came with sausage, tri tip and ribs and a few sides. The sausage was too salty again, and the tri tip and ribs were decent, but I felt they were a little on the dry side and the BBQ sauce wasn't good enough to hide that.\n\nFor dessert I got the ice cream that reminded me something like a amores sundae. While I didn't like the marshmallow, I thought the rest of it was pretty good.\n\nOverall, I felt we should have taken that $40 over to the buffet, where I could get a better variety of food for about the same quality."

My fabulous bridesmaids set-up dinner here before we went out for the evening.\n\nWe each did the prix-fixe menu. Let me tell you, that's the best idea with a group of 8 women.\n\nI started off with the Ragin' Bull. Yummy! There was a hint of Red Bull flavor - not too overpowering! The one downside was that Happy Hour prices weren't honored at your table. We didn't want to annoy the waitress and not order drinks from her, so we just didn't drink (outside of me).\n\nThe mac & cheese bites were lovely little balls of happiness. However, I didn't care for the dipping sauce. I felt it was too bland, too orange, and not worth the calories. The pretzel dipping bread? If I could stick those in my purse to snack on throughout the night, I would've! It was the quintissential Vegas drinking snack. Drink, gamble, and chew! The tuna sashimi appetizer with shrimp chips was okay. Not my favorite, but it was tasty. The fruit and nut salad was my least favorite. There was way too much dressing for my liking.\n\n5 of us had the Trenne Pasta as our meal - triangular tubed pasta with a hint of truffle oil, fresh shaved parmesan, cream sauce, proscuitto, and peas. OH MY YUMMY. The truffle oil was the perfect compliment to my creamy dish. The snap of the peas was a nice accent to the fresh made pasta. I tried the Jidori Chicken - talk about juicy and flavorful. I can't even describe the flavor, but it made me feel warm and fuzzy. My future sister-in-law had the salmon. I didn't try it, but she said it was awesome. On top of all that food, we each had our own cone of french fries - sweet potato and regular. \n\nNow dessert.....I'm a sweets girl. I love them. I need them. So needless to say, when 2 baggies of donut bites came out piping hot, covered in confectioners sugar with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces, I cried. Just one tear though. What's even better? We took them to go in our limo. SCORE!\n\nWe also shared the FOURTEEN layer chocolate cake with chocolate ganache frosting. It was rich, but it was delicious. Just 2 bites served me well.\n\nIf you want bang for your buck (prix fixe was $45 per person), ridiculously tasty food, great service (the chef came out to say hello before we even began to eat), and a very cool low key atmosphere, come to Society! You won't be disappointed."

You basically have this, and the lobby bar (grab and go breakfast sandwiches, pastries and coffee). After a night of drinking, my group wanted a little more substantial to eat - eggs, heartier dishes, and I was looking for something a little healthy since I had to be in a bathing suit for the rest of the afternoon and planned to drink my lunch in alcohol.\n\nThis place seemed a bit overpriced, but again - Vegas. If you're going to pay $18 for a drink, you're likely going to also pay $18 for a plate of eggs or a salad, especially if you're at the Encore.\n\nIn true Vegas fashion, we had to wait in line for about 10-15 min, and the place had plenty of empty tables and was only half full. If there's a line, it must be off-the-charts, right?\n\nThey have a brunch menu on the weekends but if you want salads, sandwiches and it's after 11:30 am, you can request a lunch menu (they will not automatically bring it to you)\n\nThe warm pretzel breadsticks with mustard butter were the highlight of the meal. I could have eaten 10 of them - they were so fresh, soft, fluffy and delicious and this alone would have me coming back here just to eat the pretzel bread. The server was nice enough to bring us an extra serving since the first one disappeared the minute it hit the table (comes with 6 pieces)\n\nI ordered a Superfood Salad (kale and quinoa salad) for $17. It probably cost them $3 to make the salad. And by salad, it probably had enough kale leaves that I could count it on 2 hands. It was more like a pile of quinoa with sweet potatoes, cranberries, almonds and pomegranate seeds. It was healthy and relatively filling, but certainly not worth $17. But I wasn't expecting to be blown out of the water by a salad, but I've had far better salads (with way more greens) for cheaper -- even in Vegas. If you really want a salad and don't mind walking 5-10 min, head to Grand Lux in the Palazzo for something half the price and with more lettuce / greens.\n\nMy friend did get the steak & eggs sliders which definitely gave me food envy - the savory biscuit that it came on looked so delicious, and he did like the dish.\n\nExpect to pay ~$18-20 for a brunch dish (pre-tax and tip) for not a ton of food. If you're looking for something slightly cheaper and more substantial, head to Grand Lux Cafe next door. But if you're okay spending a little more money for convenience, not-that-inventive food, and delicious, warm, just-out-of-the-oven pretzel breadsticks, this place will do."

I ordered the prix fix menu ($44) which comes with an app, entree and dessert.\n\nFor $8 more- I got the shrimp cocktail and the shrimp in these were luscious, yes luscious. I also tried some of the lobster bisque which was great. When the entree came out, it was a bit lackluster from a presentation standpoint. The \"side\" of vegetables was merely two pearl onions and two baby carrots. My friend swapped them for french fries and that was a better steal. I was supremely disappointed in my prime rib. I understand that it probably got cold because they were trying to time it with the rest of the meal... still, I couldn't fully enjoy eating the prime rib at the barely warm temperature. I figure there wasn't any reason to send it back since we were on a tight schedule and that piece of meat probably would have gone in the trash.\n\nAll in all, decent meal- but it isn't a must go to on my Vegas visits in the future."

It was a very good way to start off my day before heading out to the Strip.\n\nRight off the bat I already knew that I would be picking up their Ultimate Steak & Egg Sliders.  It totally stuck out from the rest of the menu and it's pretty obvious that that's what they want you to order.  To go with it, I went an interesting choice and decided to try one of their blended juices, The Green Monster.\n\nThe Green Monster - Cucumbers, Celery, Spinach, Fennel, Green Apples, Parsley & Ginger. CHEERS!!! --  http://bit.ly/Z3dr2F\nThis was a very invigorating juice blend but it was pretty tasty as well.  Not sure if it was exactly the right pairing for the Sliders, but it did the job.  Plus it also made up for the lack of fruits and veggies I didn't have the day before.\n\nThe Ultimate Steak & Egg Sliders - Filet Mignon, Scrambled Eggs, Creamed Spinach, Bacon Cheddar Muffin --  http://bit.ly/11dtlDU\nJust reading the description is good enough to build your appetite.  At first I was a little discouraged when the waiter said that you only get two, but when you look at the picture, you could probably understand why.  These sliders were big!  The fact that there were mini filets inside just upped the ante with any typical burger slider.  These were really good.  The filets were cooked perfectly that they weren't tough when you bit into them, but instead were really soft and easy to chew.  The bacon cheddar muffins were awesome and the creamed spinach and eggs helped the sliders all come together.  They were definitely Ultimate!!\n\nOverall, solid restaurant and worth dining at if you're staying at Encore or Wynn.  It definitely made for a great breakfast!"

The reason I've even come back to Society Cafe is because it's super convenient and you don't usually need to have a reservation.\n\nAfter a whole day of traveling, and a long check in wait, we just wanted to find a quick bite to eat. We were sat quickly on the side of the restaurant where there is a full bar. Unfortunately we were sat next to four of the loudest, drunkest middle-aged men who clearly were in no shape to be in a restaurant.  I guess there must not be a dress code because these guys were still wearing board shorts and half soaked T-shirts from the pool.  Initially I was just annoyed because they were being so loud I couldn't even hear my husband across the table. Every other word from them was vulgar.  But then they started throwing beer at each other and a lobster tail ended up being lobbed across the restaurant and I was completely appalled.   The staff were super polite, rushing over to clean up their mess, and shockingly bring them more alcohol. I think the staff were taking the path of least resistance with these guys but it made our dining experience horrific.  One of these guys was sober enough to realize that they were making a scene and kept apologizing to me but the antics of the other three continued throughout our entire dinner.  The staff completely ignored us, never offered us another table, or an apology until we addressed it directly with them.  And even after we said how bad this all was, the response was more of a brushoff than a real acknowledgement of how horrible our experience was, which is what we were looking for and should have gotten.\n\nMy husband ordered fish and chips and I ordered a kale salad. Neither of us really enjoyed our food, and it might've had something to do with what we were surrounded by. My husband sent back nearly his entire plate of food. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. She ended up having the manager take my husbands order off of the bill.  But we still ended up spending over $50 for the worst dining experience of my life.  \n\nThe waitress explained that they get plenty of these type of people because when the pool closes this restaurant is available to people with no dress code and no reservations.  I felt really bad for her because I can't imagine dealing with that on a nightly basis.\n\nDon't come here if you are expecting a nice quiet three star or above dinner. Come here if you want to grab a quick burger and don't have very high expectations."

Breakfast was pretty awesome, so I think that it was worth every penny. I heard the cinnimon rolls are pretty great.\n\nWould/will definately go back to Society Cafe at Encore.

Appetizers were served family style (pigs in a blanket served with ketchup, pretzel breadsticks served with a stoneground mustard butter, buffalo \"lollipop\" wings with ranch). First course was a choice tomato bisque (served with a drizzle of basil oil in the initials of the couple and a crispy fried basil) or caesar salad. Second course we had a choice salmon with quinoa cake and citrus vinaigrette, roasted chicken, or trenne with truffle cream sauce and peas. Dessert was wedding cake.\n\nThe service was efficient and professional and unobtrusive. The food was delicious (might be worth a mention that when serving 40+ ppl vs the standard 150-200+ at a wedding, quality of food is inversely proportional to the number of guests)."

It looked like a motif taken from Audrey Hepburn's dress in My Fair Lady (the scene at the polo game), with the beautiful black and white primary colors with fushia accents.  \n\nNow let me get to the food - amazing.  For a \"casual dining\" restaurant 5 stars as the Wynn/Encore always seem to do effortlessly.  Now let me mention the bread, which was a selection of pretzel bread or pumpernickel style pretzel bread served with warm whole grain mustard w/butter spread - addictive!\n\nBoth my sister and my mom had the wonderful steak salad, with the salad to steak ratio leaning more towards the steak!  Very tender and tasty.  I had the \"box lunch\" selecting the focacia chicken w/asparagus sandwich - delightful - the bread delicious with a wonderful fruit and nut salad, loaded with spiced cashews and fruit.  It ended with a selection with either fruit or mini donuts quite wonderful.  A very nice place for a special lunch, breakfast, brunch or even dinner.\n\nEnjoy!"

This place had a special for $38, it came with 1 appetizer (choice of Ceaser Salad, mac&cheese bites or tomato basil soup) Main (8oz fillet mignon or Cedar plank salmon) and desert-two big balls of donuts with chocolate and caramel. I got the Mac&cheese bites and the fillet mignon. all this for only 38 bucks!! the best deal i ever had, PLUS the food was AMAZING, the steak was cooked perfectly, rare + . Much better than any expensive steakhouse i've been. definatly must go if you go to Encore!!! I also had their cocktails (grape crush and some kind of fruit martini) which was also delicious!!"

Great place for the ladies!\n\nWe got blood orange mimosas which were yummy and shared the Mac and Cheese bites, Lobster Roll, and the Steak Salad. Everything was delicious! I loved the truffle dipping sauce that came with the Mac and Cheese bites, a must-try! I would definitely get that again. The lobster roll tasted clean, and I loved the soft roll and the avocado slices on top. The steak salad with the kale was yummy too, although I wished the steak was a little softer. We ordered it medium-rare but it seemed more like medium. I liked how the portions of all the dishes were just right and not too big. Service was pleasant and our food came out pretty quickly. Although it's slightly on the pricey end, I guess it's expected since it IS Vegas, and it's inside the Encore. Overall, one of the better places to eat on the Strip."

It has a large, magnificently decorated dining room with a bar that can accommodate almost 300 people.\n\nMy wife and I recently stopped there for lunch on a weekday afternoon.  We were very graciously greeted by a hostess and host and were told that we would be seated momentarily.  While waiting, we saw a very appealing dish that was being served and upon my inquiry, the host informed us that it was a ham and cheese sandwich, which he highly recommended.  Shortly thereafter, we were seated at a very comfortable table with a white tablecloth and top-of-the-line place settings.\n\nWe could not resist ordering a ham and cheese sandwich for each of us.  When the food arrived, the sandwiches were much bigger than what we expected and were certainly not your ordinary ham and cheese concoctions.  They were crammed with Kurobuta ham and Gruy\u00e8re cheese between thick slices of toasted bread.  A \"poached egg,\" a small green salad, and homemade potato chips accompanied each.  The food was delicious and extremely filling.  The ham was tender, juicy, and tasty and the cheese was very flavorful.  The eggs were cooked a bit longer than poached, but they and the greens complemented the sandwiches very well.  The potato chips were crispy and exceptionally tempting.  Our table service was outstanding.  \n\nMy wife and I were greatly impressed by the accommodating manner and skill of all the employees that we encountered.  It is obvious that management is committed to maintaining lofty standards for customer service.\n\nOur dining experience at the Society Caf\u00e9 was immensely enjoyable and memorable.  This restaurant is very highly recommended for the quality of the food, the exceptionally professional service, the gorgeous d\u00e9cor, and the reasonable cost for a top-tier establishment."

Then, (lol) to post a photo of the 'toast scrapings\"... classic. Seriously? I waited to read other reviews as I was in a hurry to get some late night action in :)\n\nAnyway, I had a great time. 4 stars instead of 5 because it was the first day, the server was trying hard to please us as she was swamped and the cute busser from France ended up helping us out more throughout the meal. (Even taking an order when needed) To me this says a bit more about the service.. again, the minus 1 star because they had kinks to work out, and I am sure they will. It's a new joint.. but  I will definitely go again. \n\nFood was quality, I had short ribs (hard to mess up) .. and the warmed pretzel bread with grain mustard butter was a nice touch while we waited for food. The price is about $50 per guest.. that was with 1appetizer, 1 cocktail each.. and 1 entree each.. no dessert.. We were too full. Portion sizes are great, and the setting is modern and comfortable. \n\nAnyway, if you are @ Encore and need a late-night meal.. check it out. \n\nOn a side note SWITCH Steakhouse looks awesome, and if you can't join them in the dining room, sit at the bar just outside and watch the scene and color of the dining room change every so often.. then go eat there! Happy eating!"

It is that sort of peculiar juxtaposition that makes this place interesting.  \n\nThe menu appears to be stock with typical diner standards of burgers, sliders, club sandwiches, usual breakfast options, European salads, and steak selections.  Unlike most cafes and diners, Society Cafe balances cool with class and friendly service.  \n\nI had the filet sliders the first time here for dinner.  The patty was nicely cooked with a perfect hint of pink.  This set of tiny burgers are complemented with grilled onions and house horseradish sauce.  The combination of condiments give the sliders a slight gamey taste resembling buffalo.  It is served alongside an aluminum cup of thin fries (you can choose between sweet potato or russet), which were crispy and not too salty. \n\nMy second entree was the American Kobe burger.  The patty was nicely seasoned and cooked.  My only complaint was that the burger buns were under, which broke apart upon gripping.  The face could have used a minute or so extra on the grill.\n\nI reserve my praise for the roast salmon.  It was beautifully cooked, moist.  The hint of sweet and sour from the accompanying citrus salad balances out the fish.  The pilaf was wonderfully al dente.  It was the highlight of my repeated visits.\n\nIf you come here for breakfast, I recommend the banana french toast; it's pleasantly light (not too sweet) despite its description.  Also, be sure to try some of the fresh-squeezed juices, most notably grapefruit and orange."

After a good walk, we gave up and chose the closest restaurant around us and that was open.  What do you know.. we ended up with\n\nSociety Cafe Encore.\n\nI thought to myself.. \"A Cafe!! Nice!!! Cheaper food!!!\"  But as we walked into the restaurant.. I changed the thought to...\" Damnn.. Fancy cheap food perhaps?\"\n\nThe decor itself was a bit strange.  A bit too much and felt disordered.  I can see where they tried the theme of plushy red and black seats, with silky dark colored curtains everywhere.  It was different but I couldn't quite catch what they were trying to do.  Yes, I know. It is ENCORE.. More out of the norm decoration to make themselves stand out compared to other hotels.. \n\nService was excellent.  Definitely not your ordinary cafe service, a plus!  I ended up ordering the\n\nSirloin burger with fries. $15 http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SKxtRSHw8AT4o0vPFTcqIw/l\n-fries were delicious.  Not too oily and crisp.  Condiments came on the side.  The dish itself was very presentable.  Not your ordinary let's dab on everything on the burger kind of style.

The steak was cooked perfectly and came with Mr. Wynn's Special Steak Sauce...wow was it good...I had to ask for more because everyone at my table was dipping all of there food in it.\n\nPersonally the staff is okay here...I would expect to be more impressed with this being a Wynn Property but it seems like the staff here are lacking in training.  I have never seen this place packed in all of the times we have eaten here, so maybe the really good waiters do not want to work here.\n\nMy buddy ordered a calamari starter and it was so fishy I would have thrown it back into the sea.  The waiter asked if it was good and he said yes...but I would have sent it back.  If I had ordered that this place would be getting one star.\n\nThe Mac and Cheese Bites Starter was also amazing too.  But Mac and Cheese Deep Fried better be good.\n\nI also started with the Lettuce Wedge with Blue Cheese and Bacon.  I had no idea that this could be bad.  First there is only one strip of bacon that was cooked two days ago sitting on top.  Maybe the Chef could have diced this up for me.  There was nice chunks of blue cheese but hardly any dressing...so it was very dry.\n\nSo as you can see I am giving this place 4 stars but that is for those amazing donuts...everything else is just really good or really bad.  I should just commit to the 3 stars but I can't do it.  I am just not a 3 star guy.\n\nOn Yelp it says that this place is Italian...there is nothing Italian about this place...there is one pasta dish but nothing else.  In fact, the menu covers ever food choice and is probably more American, then anything else.\n\nThere is also a full bar too, so drink up my friends it is VEGAS!"

Though everyone talks about their appetizers I wanted something a little more substantial to coat my tummy for drinking at the club.  I went with the $40 prix fixe menu & chose the Mac N Cheese bites for the app, the Jidori Chicken for my main & the dessert that it comes with were the donut bites.  He got the Porterhouse Pork and a side of fries.  My friend & her man shared a salad and some calamari.  Our waitress was so sweet and helpful with wine and menu suggestions.  She even let my bf have a little taste of a wine.  \n\n*Complimentary little baguette-ish sticks with mustard dipping sauce: Yummy with the right amount of saltiness!  So much better than just bread!\n*Mac N Cheese Bites: What's not to love about fried cheese?  And even better was the truffle dipping sauce!  \n*Porterhouse Porkchop: Okay.  Juicy.\n*Fries: Served with ketchup in a squirt bottle thingy.  These were okay too.\n*Jidori Chicken: Moist chicken on top of a soft bed of mash potatoes & yellow & green green beans.  \n*Donut bites were served in a paper bag with a chocolate dipping sauce & a caramel one.  There were three of them & they were just okay, nothing extraordinary.  The caramel sauce was the better of the two.\n\nI see Society as more of a place to go to for light bites.  Will return next time I want some appetizers.  All of our party of four's food and 2 glasses of wine was a little over $100..not bad for on the Strip & in Encore!"

Upon entering the restaurant, decked out in what I call \"French boudoir-meets-contemporary-flair,\" we were seated at a lovely and comfortable booth.  Service was really good all evening: unobtrusively attentive, if that makes sense.  The first thing we tried was the pretzel basket with mustard butter; apparently, we were pretty hungry, as those suckers were gone immediately.  Our server asked us if we wanted more, to which we said 'yes.'  (Hey, it was my birthday!)  We shared the berry salad, which was full of strawberries and pecans and definitely large enough to split.  For our entr\u00e9es, we chose the Chilean sea bass and the roasted Scottish salmon, both of which were cooked perfectly.  I particularly enjoyed the brown butter sauce that encircled the sea bass -- creamy, buttery goodness.  \n\nI normally select chocolate cake for dessert, but I had pie on the brain because 1) it was \"pi\" day and 2) I really like pie.  Our server actually dissuaded us from the chocolate cake because we were already pretty full and he didn't think we could fit one piece into our already-swollen selves.  He pointed to the cake and we were pretty impressed -- and scared -- that we could see all 7 layers from 30 feet away.  Thus, I chose the apple pie, which was warm, fruity, and spicy all encased in buttery, flaky pastry.  \n\nAll in all, my experience was excellent and my dinner was lovely.  I would like to check out Society's brunch to compare experiences!"

We ordered calamari, flatbread, mac 'n cheese bites, and warm donut bites with delicious warm chocolate and caramel dipping sauces!

Society Cafe, which opens up to the casino, has a much more distinct and striking decor.  Society Cafe has a mix of traditional elegance and modern decor (the kind of mishmash decor I've often seen in West Hollywood places like The Bazaar or the now closed XIV).\n\nThe decor raised my expectations for the food and the breakfast menu featured many nice sounding dishes.  There was an abundant use of premium ingredients throughout the menu.\n\nI went with the ultimate steak and egg sliders, which were featured on The Best Thing I Ever Ate.  The sliders consisted of filet mignon, scrambled egg and creamed spinach on bacon and cheddar muffins.  The sliders were good.  Even though the individual components were not excellent, they did combine to make a satisfying sandwich (but maybe not an exceptional sandwich like the fried egg sandwich at Huckleberry in Santa Monica).\n\nThe scrambled eggs were moist and I liked the creamed spinach even though I wish it had more flavor.  The filet mignon was meaty and savory though I wish it was cooked more medium rare or at least medium.  While the filet mignon was not dry, I would have preferred more juiciness (I do understand this type of temperature in a sandwich though since you don't want the redness of the meat to combine with the muffin to make an unappetizing color).\n\nWhile the bacon flavor of the muffins was not that strong, the muffin was still cheesy and flavorful and had a good combination of softness as well as a crisp and distinct edge.\n\nI also had the pain au chocolat (the order was actually 2 small chocolate croissants). The mini chocolate croissants were similar to the ones at Breadbar in Century City.  The croissants were flaky, crispy and chocolatey (I think the pain au chocolat at Breadbar has a more even chocolate flavor--a noticeable chocolate flavor with each bite).  I liked the pain au chocolat at Society Cafe Encore much more than the same pastry at Bouchon Bakery (in the Venetian)--more flakiness and more chocolate.\n\nService was very good.  My waitress was very personable, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.\n\nPrices were high for breakfast, but that is common on The Strip where restaurants tend to be anywhere from 15% to 40% more than what you would pay in a city like LA.  Still, Society Cafe was not that much more expensive than some of the other casino cafes and the difference in quality was very noticeable.\n\nI enjoyed Society Cafe Encore and it was my best casino cafe experience in Las Vegas so far.  I would definitely consider coming back on future Vegas trips to try other menu items.\n\nI am not sure what the parking situation is, but I imagine Encore offers both valet and self-parking."

Instead of bread, this place served baked pretzels sticks which is refreshingly different.  Sadly it does seem like the quality has declined a little since it first opened."

Had a horrible experience with the waiter Joshua. \n\nI had a question bout the \"build your own burger\" which was priced at $19 (exceptionally high priced for a burger). I asked how many toppings come with this price? He replied with \"as many as you want, don't worry I got you.\" Exact words. Then he starts \"selling\" me on the toppings even telling me he can add an extra patty. Nowhere did he mention the extra costs each topping came with. Me thinking all the toppings were already included in the ridiculous price presumed to top off my burger with 5 additives (egg, cheese, mushroom, avocado, and extra patty).\n\nGot my burger and it was delicious. Idk if I was buzzed or just starving but it was BOMB. Joshua had the audacity to ask \"how it tasted?\" And me being the fool that I am gave him two thumbs up while stuffing my face.\n\nWhen I got the check the burger came out to  $31. First off all no burger is every worth $31 IDC unless there's some magical ingredients In there they are tripping if they gonna charge that.\n\nI then went to question my waiter bout the situation. This is when he goes to tell me that toppings cost extra. I'm just saying if I was a waiter I would have said something sooner especially when someone orders 5 different f***en toppings. He then cuts me off and gets his manager.\n\nBy now I'm heated. This dude just gave me some attitude. Making me and my friends wait. His manager comes out and I explain the situation to him. He then goes off to tell me to \"lower my voice\". Now I'm really ticked. I start talking even louder. Dropping an f word here and there. He said it's unfortunate this happened and that I will only need to pay for the extra patty the other toppings are on the house. That the patty was $8. $8 for a patty... So feeling bad im wasting my homies time I obliged and paid. \n\nIn the end I will never come back again. No matter how drunk or desperate I am. Personally don't like surprises on my check. Enough to make me not want to come back. Burger was amazing THO but not worth the $27. \n\nTo End on a positive note the pretzel stick bread they give out with the little sauce on the side are BOMB af. If I do come back THATS prolly the only thing ima eat."

In my hungover state all that I could see on the menu was \"Sloppy Joe's\".  They come in sliders and in a burger form.  I ordered the Sloppy Joe sliders.  They were so good that I actually finger licked my plate clean of all Sloppy Joe juice...totally disgusted my husband.  Once the headaches began to lift we began talking to the two bartenders working...Robert and Eric.  Freaking HILARIOUS!!!!

It took 20 minutes to get our drinks from the bar.  They had one bartender working on a holiday weekend, next to the Encore Beach Club.  How do you only have one bartender working?!  Not to mention, they herded everyone into the front of the restaurant, where you could breathe in all the cigarette smoke from the casino (and it was bad today) while you're trying to eat.  The service, besides the slow bar service was average at best.  We're going to eat there for breakfast tomorrow.  If it's not good, it will be my last trip to this place.  the ONLY reason they get three stars is based on the food and the first visit there.

As soon as we walked up to the hostess, and I saw they had a bowl of red Swedish fish out (with a serving spoon of course) I knew this place was going to be awesome, because I loooooooooooove red Swedish fish! \n\nThey also serve these awesome pretzel sticks (one is pumpernickel) with peanut butter butter....these were spectacular To be honest with you I would have been fine with just the red fish and pretzel sticks...I'm low maintenance like that ; ) \n\nOkay, anyways...I ended up ordering the chopped salad and hubby had the ham and cheese sandwich. We also enjoyed the chicken lollipop chicken wings for an appetizer. All were great choices and definitely hit the spot. \n\nWe also visited this place for breakfast on our last day here, and I had the egg white frittata and he had the mini quiches. I did order a side of nine grain toast with mine and was only able to finish about half of my frittata...it was huge too! I loved the goat cheese in my frittata, but found myself digging into the middle just to get to the goat cheese! His mini quiches were just that....mini, and served with a side of tuna salad I think. \n\nBreakfast was also served with some nice entertainment...some old guy with sunglasses wondered in and just passed out on one of the couch/benches right beside another diner. Everyone started looking around like \"something just doesn't seem right with this\" (and giggling of course). He started kicking the diners that were next to him (I guess to get more comfortable) and they were moved to another nearby table before security escorted the drunk guy out. It was just funny how the whole thing came about...you just don't see that everyday, even in Vegas, and definitely not the Encore, haha! \n\nLoved Society Cafe and plan to return (mainly for the Swedish fish and pretzel sticks)!!!"

            "review": "Oddly, as I was eating my croissant I received a text from my friend who I was to eat lunch with later that day - he had made it to town early and was going to be stuck at the Olympia all afternoon - he wanted to know if we could make it breakfast instead.  Certainly not full after two small pastries I agreed and he suggested we meet over at the Wynn - near the poker room.  As previously noted, I'm usually a man with a plan when it comes to eating on vacation so the walk over to the Wynn provided me ample time to think of a good spot - eventually deciding to get out of the Wynn, check out Encore, and grab breakfast at  Caf\u00e9 Society Encore.\n\nArriving just after 9:00am I was surprised to find the large restaurant packed and my friend and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait 20 minutes for a table.  Seated promptly and provided with menus our drink orders were taken - a coffee for myself and a $9 (ouch) vanilla protein shake for my friend.  While he noted the shake was tasty my friend was admittedly shocked when the bill arrived - even using the best whey on the market there is no way this shake was more than $1 worth of ingredients.  My coffee, also expensive at $4 for a relatively average brew, was refilled slowly at best - and only when I asked.  All this despite there being two bartenders and only one other person at the 10-seat bar.\n\nPlacing our orders next my buddy opted for the waffle with blueberries, a side of egg whites, and an English muffin - all of which he stated were good but \"overpriced\" while I myself chose the Frosted Flake French Toast with Caramelized Bananas and Chocolate Cream.  Arriving after a relatively short wait the dish contained two pieces of brioche dipped in frosted flakes and topped with perhaps one half of a caramelized banana plus a small dollop of creamy but decidedly unchocolately chocolate cream.  Taking an initial bite I have to admit the quality of the bread itself was marvelous and the bananas were wonderful while the chocolate lacked.  Adding a few tablespoons of pure Vermont maple syrup definitely helped the dish - mostly by adding a bit of sweetness but also by bringing forth some of the more subtle vanilla and cinnamon tones of the bread.  A good dish, but at $15 nearly twice the price of the vastly superior and larger French toast at m.henry in Chicago and more expensive than either Keller's or The Country Club's wonderful bread-pudding-style French Toasts in Vegas. \n\nSitting for a while and chatting with my friend - later making plans for another brunch a couple days later I was glad that we were not rushed out but a little disappointed that I had to ask more than once for a coffee refill and that my water glass was taken away after a single glass and never returned.  In the end the total cost for the meal was nearly $50 for food that was good but not great and service that was present at best.  Paying our bill we walked away largely unimpressed - having had breakfasts at multiple places in Vegas now I'd steer clear and make my way to Bouchon, Mon Ami Gabi, The Country Club, or Tableau first - for the price you could even cab it to Hash-House-A-Go-Go and eat cheaper (and perhaps better) - but then if you did that you probably wouldn't have room for lunch and dinner."

I loved the colors and decor.  Wait staff were pleasant and professional. \n\nThe blood orange mimosas, made tableside and with a smile and pleasant light conversation, were really really good.  The juice wasn't pulpy and the juice to sparkling wine ratio was perfect. \n\nAnd then we saw the monkey bread on the menu!  Even if you only have one piece during breakfast, order this (and take the rest back to your room to reheat for a late night snack later)!  We shared *and* took leftovers with us.  The consistency and level of sweetness were just perfect. \n\nFor the main breakfast I had an egg white frittata, and my friend had eggs and bacon and toast.  They were both very good. \n\nI would go back here in a heartbeat for breakfast next time I'm in Vegas!"

I should have sent it back and the server asked but it took so long to get our food I didn't want to deal with it. At $19 or $20  it's overpriced because you have to pay another $5 for a side of fries. The prime rib my wife ordered was a 3.5 and the burger was a 2.5.**** But when you compare this restaurant to the Lux Caf\u00e9 at the Venetian/Palazzo it's not even close based on quantity and quality. COME ON Mr.Wynn you can do better than this!"

They have an AMAZING selection of Bloody Marys - all of which are SUPER delicious.  They also serve complementary pretzel sticks that comes with mustard butter, which may sound gross but its actually B-O-M-B.  For the entree, we tried the Sea Bass and Blackjack Burger.  The Sea Bass was tender and delicious.  A definite must-try for seafood lovers.  The Blackjack Burger was also good (how could it not be with pork belly and onion rings on it) but it was also a gut buster.  I ate about half of it before my heart started to slow down.  As for the service, its in the Wynn so you know its good.  I recommend this place to any one whos looking for a nice dining experience that wont break the bank."

Combining my favorite breakfast food with my favorite cereal is simply ingenious! And believe me it works, too.\n\nWe loved this dish so much we not only vowed to return to Society Cafe, but next time to order two of these instead of that great omelette. \n\nSociety Cafe has a very comfortable atmosphere and excellent service as well.

It's a pet peeve of mine when the hostess seats you and it takes forever for a server to show up. \n\nI also liked that the menu had limited options, but managed to have variety. When there are too many choices to pick from I get overwhelmed. I would normally gloss right over any part of a menu mentioning a \"continental breakfast\" but at Society Cafe, I scanned the menu in search of this because I noticed the European tourists at the table next to us liesurely enjoying some croissants, muffins and danishes with some marmalade. \n\nWe shared the continental breakfast and the steak and egg sliders. This was one of the best breakfasts I've had on the strip. Choosing the continental breakfast allowed up to have a choice between a few different baked good types. We picked a croissant, a cherry danish and the pumpkin muffin top accompanied. Our baked goods were accompanied by sweet butter and a variety of marmalades. I'm not usually into dry baked good, but these were super soft and fresh and a great compliment to my tea. The steak  on the steak and eggs sliders was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy and the eggs and creamed spinach were the perfecet pairing.

Half of the doughnut was doughy with no sugar and the part that was cooked ok had too much sugar! Very inconsistent! \n\nI was amazed by the fact that they pulled and pushed your chair out/in for you and even took the napkin ring off and placed the napkin in your lap for you.

WHO does that?\n\nSo if you want ok food (2 stars), good service (4 stars for neglecting us towards the end of the meal. No water refill!!!!), and don't mind forking over that 36% tip for your meal, BY ALL MEANS, eat here."

I was not hungover, but completely buzzed all throughout dinner. However, I do remember that my tastebuds were happy about what was consumed. \n\nI didn't really have much of an appetite, but everyone seemed to force me to eat each of my 3-courses. We started with mac 'n' cheese bites, which were the perfect combination of two of my favorite comfort foods: mac 'n' cheese and tater tots. The dipping sauce (I think it had truffle oil in it) was so yummy. I chose to go all out on carbs and got the trenne pasta with prosciutto for my main entree. I think this also had truffle oil in the sauce. The triangular penne pasta was delicious. For dessert, we had the donut balls. I'm pretty sure the caramel sauce I had with it did NOT have truffle oil in it.\n\nOur server Todd (thanks for refreshing my memory, Cindy), and the Assistant GM Patrick were both very accommodating and friendly. Even though they had taken off the petite filet mignon from the $36 prix-fixe menu, they were still able to offer them to us since the concierge had told us it would be available. \n\nAlthough we missed out on a fabulous dinner at Mix at Mandalay Bay, I'm glad we went with Plan B and came here. Again, thank goodness for photos."

This restaurant, adjacent to the casino provides a nice respite from the buzz of gambling and other casino/hotel activities. The menu is upscale enough to give diners great options for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The casual atmosphere allows you to forget that you're in Las Vegas as it is calm and decorated in soothing colors...furniture is comfy and the bar and dining areas are spacious. \n\nWe arrived around 9:30pm to grab a light bite after seeing a Cirque du soleil show at the Mandalay Bay hotel. After perusing many menus at the various restaurants in our hotel, we opted for the society cafe. The service is on point, friendly and attentive. We were given two baskets of pretzel rolls which were soft, warm and incredibly fresh. I enjoyed the citrus salad with poached shrimp which was a beautiful medley of julienned radishes and other crunchy veggies like fennel and fris\u00e9e topped with giant shrimp and served with a side of avocado pur\u00e9e and a citrus vinaigrette. Perfect for this late hour. Others feasted on burgers ranging from turkey and veggie to the signature society burger. Fries were perfectly crisp. The ahi tuna sizzling appetizer was sensational. I had a side of spicy garlic broccolini which was spectacular. Overall, we were pleased with this upscale pub/cafe food. Our friends raved about the watermelon mojitos and I enjoyed a glass of Jordan Chardonnay. \n\nToo full for dessert...but if you leave room, the giant ten layer chocolate cake that sits about 10\" high on the plate looks like it could feed 8 people. The sundaes and other sweets featured also looked yummy on their way past our table. \n\nThis place is certainly a nice alternative after indulging in so many of the heavier but delicious fine dining establishments in the Wynn/Encore. For us, it hit the spot late night on a Sunday after so much eating and drinking over the weekend."

Since the club was just barely starting to fill up and nobody else in our group was hungry, we figured we had time to grab a bite to eat. The nearest cafe to the left of the exit had a waiting period of 20 mins and we didn't want to wait, so we headed in the opposite direction. We ended up at Society Cafe.\n\nTuna tacos ($14): Spicy tuna tartare, crispy tortilla, avocado cream\nIt's been 1.5 weeks and I still can't forget about these! The tacos are unbelievably cute (I really regret not taking a picture of them). They were heartily stuffed with tuna, which I wasn't expecting. I expected the tacos to have a couple of pieces of tuna at most, but I was wrong! Perfect balance of spice and a drizzle of avocado cream.\n\nAmerican Kobe Burger ($19): Lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles\nBFF looked like he was enjoying his burger immensely, which was actually kind of weird because he would NEVER eat anything of this sort if we were at home (he's VERY health-conscious). He ended up eating the entire burger and fries.\n\nFrench fries ($7): Pretty decent. Not the freshest-tasting fries I've had, but they were pretty tasty. BFF agreed.\n\nPretzel breadsticks (complimentary): YUM YUM YUM! I usually watch my carbs intake, but I was willing to throw all that out the window for these things. It didn't really help that BFF asked for a second cup of breadsticks after we had devoured the first cup.\n\nVERY friendly service staff, although the kitchen was extremely slow. BFF was buzzed and couldn't figure out if it was just him or if we had actually been waiting for our food for a long while. But I was completely sober and yes- we waited about 30-35 minutes for his burger and my fries.\n\nI'll definitely be back for more of those tuna tacos and pretzel breadsticks, though!"

It would work as a light dish.\nAfter beverages and sides factored in, the two of us cost 60 for breakfast, and that's just 2 breakfasts, 2 drinks, and one side. \nService was decent, waitress seemed rushed a lot.

The caramel was by far my favorite as the chocolate had a real bitterness to it. We also split their take on a banana split. The ice cream was so full of flavor and served in an almond praline cup which I promptly devoured. The banana portion ended up being 3 banana halves dipped in white, milk, and dark chocolate and then frozen. It was a neat way to approach the sundae and I enjoyed it. The most fun was that the ice cream itself was topped with Pop Rocks! They did all kinds of fun stuff once they hit your tongue. The bill for 2 desserts and 2 coffees came to $30."

As soon as it re-opened, we all went for breakfast. We were taken with the vibrant decor, which was gorgeous: kind of a faux-Victoriana vibe going on, with a lot of black and white and plush upholstery pieces and heavy brocade drapes with humongous tassles and pops of magenta... you get the idea! Striking and lovely.\n\nPerhaps we hit up the place at an off-time, as the service was really lacking. Yes, our waiter took our orders promptly, but he and the other waitstaff were super slow in bringing us our coffees and food. Parties that were seated way after us were served way sooner. We thought that perhaps they forgot about us. Then our foods started coming out and they messed up our orders. My father specifically wanted a bowl of blueberries and they brought him mixed berries, and the wrong juice. (We didn't order anything wacky! Just the advertised menu fare). \n\nFinally, when we all received our correct orders, I admit, the food was really good. I had the 2 eggs \"Free Style\" with bacon and toast and potatoes. It was great. My parents had a combination of blueberries (did you know they were considered a \"Super Food\"? LOL who knew?), and eggs and cereal. Sure, it was pricey, but everything was cooked how we wanted, with decent portions. Once the food arrived, that is.....\n\nMy parents went back to Society Cafe for breakfast a few times after I left Vegas and they enjoyed it. Again, I suspect that I was just there on an off-day.

Comes with 3 so easy to share.\nReuben Pastrami sandwich. Pretty decent, but a bit dry. \nBanana Split Sundae: A \"deconstructed sundae where all the parts are separate. There's 3 halves of bananas dipped in white/milk/dark chocolate. Also very good to share and the ice cream is very good.\n\nService:\nIt was a bit slow, but since it's Mother's Day, I'm not going to blame them.\n\nFor the guy pushing around the cocktail cart, this is what I have to say to you: I don't know why you ignored me throughout the entire meal. I didn't have anything to drink on my table and yet you kept pushing your cart past me. You've offered drinks and even bantered with other customers. So I guess you don't think I'm worthy enough for you to make me a drink. So thanks for nothing.\n\nThe entire meal was excellent except for the mobile bartender. This brought this awesome restaurant down 2 stars."

Picked Society over over-priced Asian food.\n\nAMBIANCE\nWhen you think \"cafe\" you think coffee, juice, sandwiches, etc.  This is definitely not your typical cafe so don't be fooled by the name.  The decor is beautiful, modern, and clean, and it's nothing less than what you'd expect from Encore/Wynn.\n\nFOOD\nThe food was good.  No, I don't dream about it every night and probably won't make the extra effort to come back and eat here if I was staying at another hotel, but it was still considered good.  We got the spicy tuna tacos which was tasty.  I got the white meat chicken which came out perfect- not dry at all.  My friend got fish which I didn't care to try but he said it was good.\n\nPRICE\nIt's the Encore, it's Vegas! Nothing is ever considered overpriced here right? Two people's main entree (no steak) with an appetizer and no drink cost us about $100 (including tip/tax) so not toooo shabby, but don't think you're coming here and paying anything less.\n\nOVERALL\nEverything was pretty ok for me, which is the reason why I give it 3 stars. No real complaints besides the fact that it didn't blow me away, which I think then \"a-ok\" is rightfully deserved."

I liked the music they were playing - an eclectic mix of current top 40, older hits, jazz and some mellow club music.  The music was a bit loud, which would be fine for most occasions, but not for a business dinner.  We asked our waitress to turn the volume down and they did.  It was very accomodating of them.\n\nThe mac+cheese balls are as good as everyone says, although my Italian guests were probably appalled at this very American concept.  I had the fruit and nut salad first and it was fantastic.  I loved the pomagranate seeds and the dressing was light and just right.  For my main course, I was pretty boring and ordered the chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans.  But it was delicious and hey, it's a classic.\n\nThe food was great and the atmosphere, although not ideal for business, was fun and I can see myself returning for a girls night next time."

Most diners seem to be from the hotel, but that doesn't make it any less deserving of it's rating.  Even in a loud casino, the environment within the restaurant seems to me miles away.  The atmosphere is like an English tea house and service is relaxed and you should take your time to enjoy the meal.\n\nBetween the three of us, we had the Society Breakfast, the Eggs Benedict and the Egg White Frittata.  The Society Breakfast included 2 organic eggs, country sausage, bacon and potatoes + 2 pieces of toast with butter and your choice of tea and coffee.  Despite it sounding like a Denny's breakfast, the sausage seemed fresh and the roasted potatoes were cooked/fried perfectly.  Tea was English black and came with lemon and a small jar of honey.  The Eggs Benedict looked quite tasty as well and there is an option to have it on top of crab cakes.  I didn't taste it myself, but there was a poached egg on top of ham and cheese with an English muffin and a side of potatoes.  The egg white fritatta had baby asparagus with mushrooms and goat cheese.  I had a taste of this and it was spectacular, the cheese complimented the fritatta so well.  The entire meal service was approximately 90 minutes.\n\nService was relaxed and a bit slow, so don't expect it to be a quick meal.  Chat it up and enjoy the presentation and the formal presentation of \"courses,\" even for breakfast.  This restaurant lives up to it's decidedly upper-class clientele and definitely provides a dining experience that's in-line with the cost..  My meal was comped by the hotel, but even without it, I would leave feeling satisfied.\n\nPortions are medium-sized, I expected much less than what they gave us, but it was definitely sufficient for a brunch meal.\n\nEgg white Fritatta = $17\nEggs Benedict = $16\nSociety Breakfast = $19"

Well basically a small mcmuffin with nasty tasting beef.... $20! Beef short rib hash? Soggy potatoes swimming in grease, flavorless stewed to death beef mixed into it with liberal applications of salt in a desperate attempt by the kitchen to convey some kind of taste. When we complained we were told by the waitress she would get a manager but the only thing that came was the tab..... Sorry she was a sweet enough girl but nothing could be rescued from this train wreck.... No tip. Total $72 for two inedible meals and bad coffee.

The golden beets and oranges made it slightly less freaky looking than the traditional red beets that I'm used to. Plus the taste felt a lot more subtle with the beets instead of screaming BEETS BEETS BEETS.\n\nHusband ordered the Bacon Bloody (bakon vodka, mezcal and lime) which came with a strip of bacon. It is a very savory drink and tasted like a cool tomato bacon soup.\n\nTo dine, he ordered the Ultimate Steak and Egg Sliders. Y-U-M. It was a nice cut of filet mignon steak on top of eggs, topped off with delicious creamed spinach. The order comes with 2 sliders, which was surprisingly satisfying and enough for him to feel full off of.\n\nI ordered the monkey bread, which came out a lot larger, warmer and fluffier than I expected. It had a consistency similar to a cinnamon bun and less like the brioche monkey breads I was used to. Nonetheless, I was able to eat almost the entire thing before tapping out.\n\nOur entire meal, including tip, came out to about $70.

When you sit they usually bring you pretzel sticks with a Dijon mustard flavored spread while you wait for food (its amazing, I'm a bit obsessed!) From burgers to steaks this place has wonderful food. I ordered the tomato bisque which I usually get as an appetizer and a salad wedge that came with blue cheese, bacon and a range of colorful baby tomatoes.

What I meant by that is that there are ALOT of places at Wynn / Encore but really they are mostly awful, all of them.  Pretty much any review of any eats at Wynn / Encore are very mixed.\n\nWe stayed at Encore and at at Society twice during this stay (6/11/15 thru 6/14/15).  I have eaten a total of 3 times (once on prior visit to Vegas two years ago).  Bottom line is that if you can keep the alcohol / breakfast juice bill to a minimum, you will find some great prices on great meals.  We ate dinner for under $100 and breakfast for under $40 by only 1 glass wine and no OJ.  The meals were really good, we finished our plates.  For dinner, I had the prime rib deal for $42 for appetizer, meal, and dessert.  Wife had the chicken breast.  Both were exceptional.  Breakfast in the morning was cooked perfectly and plates cleaned.  Staff was welcoming and made efforts so that we could share everything.\n\nI have tried some others there at Wynn / Encore, just not impressed with the quality for how much you pay at the other offerings.  Society is spot on.  No need to walk in heat / through the homeless to go to Denny's or the Peppermill.\n\nIt does seem that Society is the exception and is the only place we will dine going back to Wynn / Encore"

The outside has that typical soft pretzel flavor that one would expect but the insides reminded me more of Hawaiian sweet rolls.  Unexpected but good.\n\nPlates came out in quick succession, thanks in part to great staffing, an early meal time and it being a featured prix fixe option.  Next up was a Caesar salad. spicy, salty, garlicky crouton off set against a creamy dressing, crunchy romaine and parm.  I'm not typically a Caesar guy but it's very good.  I felt bad for the crunchy sweet romaine but once I had picked through all of the Parmesan I was done.  In all fairness I was pacing myself for - I knew - mashed potatoes, 14oz prime rib, a lb of lobster and some veg plus a desert were all coming.\n\nThe prime rib was delicious as one would expect but the sides held there own.  assertive horseradish mashed potatoes.  intense carrots - i suspect they actually cook fresh from the farm carrots in carrot stock.  robust deep au jus that got even more complex as it cooled off.  I had to ask for their recipe for it, as I've made some au jus.  While mine were simple, I couldn't put my finger on what was going on.  It was all in the herbs.  Beef drippings from the prime rib de-glazed and reduced with chicken stock with the help of some thyme and rosemary.  Gotta love how something so simple can develop into something so complex and wonderful given a little time.\n\nIt's cliche, i know, but the doughnuts were like butter.  (or M&M's) Melt in your mouth... \n\nThey were a couple little doughnut wholes with two dipping sauces but the chocolate was my clear favorite.  I snacked on one trying both sauces and saved the other two in the little bag they present them.  Which is a good move because after all that food I was stuffed and took 2 to go.  dribbling a little of the dark slightly spicy chocolate sauce over the two in the bag.  Settling off and a way a I went.  \n\nThis whole thing has been about the food but as I alluded to earlier the waitstaff were on point - always ready for a refill on water, monitoring where i was in the meal for the next item to be delivered or grabbing a cocktail.  flawless service that almost goes unnoticed until you realize at the end of the meal you really never wanted anything else.  \n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention the decor - it's set in the encore - and it's beautifully appointed.  Maybe the only negative is that it's adjacent to the pool party area - so towards the end of the day there is a sea of sloshed sailors stumbling their way back to their suites in their sandals.  I think it makes for good people watching so I didn't mind but some might in which case sit deeper into the restaurant."

It arrived to our table warm and filled with sweet goodness!  My husband ordered the Society omelette which was a little bit smaller than we remembered it being described on the menu, but was delicious nonetheless.

I would not pay $90 out of pocket for this lunch for two. I actually think there's better value elsewhere on the properties. The pricing structure definitely caters to gamblers and tourists. I think naming the place Cafe is a bit misleading as it is equivalent to an upscale sit down restaurant, but gives the impression that it is a place to drop by for something quick and cheap. \n\nFood: 3.5 stars. \n\nThe $17 trio appetizer, a happy hour special, included meatballs, cheese balls, and calamari. This was the best part of the meal; 5 stars for that. Small servings (appears larger in pic) but they were all delicious and top notch quality. Really good cheese and meatballs! \n\nSpaghetti with meatballs for $26. In the end it's still spaghetti. Nothing special here. 2.5 stars. \n\nTurkey burger with fries: $22. Good quality but the seasoning was kind of odd and didn't really blend well. A bit sweet. 3 stars as it wasn't really anything special. I think Fuddruckers is a lot better and quite cheaper. Good fries, and they were presented in a metal holder, which seemed to keep them piping hot and well insulated for awhile. Really cool feature. 4 stars. \n\nIced tea: good stuff, and is pretty much top notch everywhere on the properties. $4.50. Standard; 5 stars.\n\nXXXL chocolate cake for dessert. This actually had the most value out of the whole meal. A HUGE piece of cake for $12. Good quality and not too sweet. It's roughly equivalent to 3 single pieces at your local family restaurant. So basically $4/slice, and superior quality, which outranks most restaurants. 5 stars.\n\nService: Really mixed. The hostess was friendly and beautiful and did her job very well (even placed the napkin on the lap). Fine dining service; 5 stars. I don't recommend going there around 4PM on Sunday as I got a weird vibe from the waitress. Also felt a bit rushed in more than one occasion. The place was relatively empty compared to other places with NFL on, so there was no good reason for that type of service. 2 stars for her. The servers however were really well-mannered, humorous, and professional. I was also asked if I had any specific food allergens (this actually should be required at all restaurants, but it's more of an exception than the norm). Very courteous. 5 stars for them! Maybe go there 2-3PM as I think the waitress started her shift a little later. Not sure what to combine the rating at as it would be unfair, but everything minus the waitress was definitely 5 stars. \n\nOther than that, the food might be worth it at half price. It's a decent place to redeem comps or stop by during happy hour."

My boyfriend and I went here for a late dinner, and it was still pretty busy. After being seated, the waiter brought out complimentary pretzel bread with whole grain mustard butter. The bread, still warm and soft, was delicious with the mustard butter, and a unique alternative to the standard bread choices offered at other places. After looking over the menu, my boyfriend ordered Filet Sliders and a Potato and Bacon Cake from the Sides, and I ordered Rock Shrimp and Crisped Calamari and A Tasting of Salads. Here's a breakdown of the food:\n\nFilet Sliders (Caramelized Onions, Horseradish Cream, and side of French Fries): The sliders were delicious; I especially enjoyed the horseradish cream, which gave the sliders a nice kick. The French fries were thin and crispy- just the way I like fries to be. \n\nPotato and Bacon Cake (Mashed potatoes mixed with sour cream, bacon, and green onions formed into a large cake and pan-fried): I tried a little bit of this, and although it was tasty, I didn't think it was anything special and I probably would not order this again. \n\nRock Shrimp and Crisped Calamari (Lightly battered calamari, rock shrimp, and thin slices of bell pepper served with caper aioli and zucchini chips): Very good appetizer to share. \n\nA Tasting of Salads (Caesar, Fruits & Nuts, and Iceberg Wedge): All the salads were delicious and fresh. I enjoyed all the different ingredients used in each salad, and each salad had its own unique taste from the sweet Fruit & Nuts salad to the savory Iceberg Wedge to the classic Caesar. My favorite salad was the Fruits & Nuts salad (Field greens, figs, pears, dried cherries and cranberries, and cashews tossed in a sweet pomegranate vinaigrette) followed by the Iceberg Wedge (Crisp bacon, Tear Drop tomatoes, blue cheese chunks, and red onion drizzled with a blue cheese dressing). The Caesar salad was tasty; my favorite part about the salad was the pretzel bread croutons, which I thought was a great idea. \n\nOverall, food and service were good. I will definitely go back to Society Caf\u00e9 to try some of their other menu items in the future."

Instead I ordered a sparling water, so she brought me a huge bottle that was big enough for four people and charged me $8.50.  That is a little much for one person to have water, if you ask me.  Then she didn't check on me again until I was almost done eating my breakfast.\n\nThe omelt and potatoes didn't have much flavor either.  I wasn't impressed."

The ambiance was cool, the waiter (forget his name) was SUPER attentive, and the food was amazing.\n\n- Coffee, 5 stars:  probably one of the only breakfast places where I have tasted a noticeable difference in quality and/or flavor; one of a kind selection\n- Eggs Benedict, 4 stars:  hard to differentiate but solid\n- Corn Flake French Toast, 10 stars:  best I have EVER had, hands down.  The texture and flavor itself combined with the cream and syrup were something I will never forget\n\nSure, it was expensive - but what do you expect eating at the Encore?  You shouldn't eat here if you don't expect to spend at least $20/per person for breakfast.  I would definitely come back here again."

We had a reservation and were a little late which the staff was accommodating once we called. We were seated right away once we did arrive. The d\u00e9cor is fantastic with large booths and bright colored wallpaper and curtains.  The staff was friendly and quick to take our order. The drinks were very expensive about $15 each so we skipped that. For lunch they had a special soup or salad and sandwich special for $23. I went with the pumpkin soup which was delicious and the ham and cheese sandwich also very good. The portions were very small-small cup of soup and only half a sandwich.  For dessert it came with 3 small warm donuts which were served in a cute white sandwich bag.  Another in my group ordered the burger which she thought was just ok. We had 2 Vegans in the group and this restaurant has a nice selection for vegetarians or vegans. The each ordered a veggie burger with fries that also came with a vegan chocolate shake and were quite pleased with it. Overall I would go for a drink and to see the Encore."

Our server was very quick and took our drink orders. Came back with our drinks with generous amounts of pretzels + dipping sauce. I asked him if the pretzel had butter or if the sauce had dairy... no butter, yes dairy in the sauce. within 3 minutes he came back with a vegan version of the dipping sauce. IMPRESSIVE! Was the most flavorful thing I've tasted since going vegan... just kidding (half kidding).\n\nOrdered:\nOrecchiette pasta (Foraged Mushrooms, Asparagus, Green & Yellow Beans,\nRoasted Tomatoes, Brussels Sprouts, Broccoli Rabe) - $19 This pasta was delicious! I was surprised with how present the flavors were for being made without red or alfredo sauce. Amazing! I'm a bit picky with pasta and this was just perfect! Not try at all and the perfect texture. Highly recommend!\nSociety Vegetable Tasting (Red & White Quinoa, Grilled Artichoke, Abalone Mushrooms,\nRoasted Beets, All Things Green) - $20 SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FREAKIN' AMAZING! Hands down the BEST roasted beets I've ever had in my life. It literally melted in my mouth. The green consisted of asparagus and green beans which was also very good. I kid you not, the quinoa was life changing. I pride myself in making the best quinoa, but this place takes the gold medal.... I still get silver. Everyone at my table seemed to enjoy it as well :) Vegan or not, I highly recommend this dish. It would be great as an appetizer to share.\n\nPrices are reasonable for the quality of food you get. Presentation is beautiful and service is just remarkable. I can't wait to try the other restaurants at Encore and the Wynn!"

What may be discomforting to some does, though, broaden the usefulness of the space to be a more social and relaxing environment rather than simple utilitarian eatery.  The food is pretty good and does a decent job of offering, as promised by the website, \"a twist on the comfort food that everyone loves.\"\n\nFor lunch, I started with the Tomato Bisque, which was artistically presented, and I felt bad digging into it.  The pretzel bread with mustard spread was an appreciated and refreshing change from the usual bread and butter.  I got the Filet Sliders ($22) on the recommendation of the server.  They were more filling than I anticipated and tasted alright--definitely better than ordinary sliders in using the filet instead of ground beef.  I would probably, however, look for a more adventurous offering on a second visit.  The sliders also come with some decent thick-cut fries."

Service was courteous and prompt. I started off the meal with a pumpkin spice latte and my bf got a mocha. I've never tried the pumpkin spice drink from Starbucks big I'm sure this place puts them to shame. Next we decided to share an order of the honey brioche with walnuts. One word to describe it is heavenly! So good! Better than any waffle or pancake I've ever tasted. Pure sweet deliciousness of caramelized honey and fluffy bread with some type of cheese cake whipped frosting that complemented it perfectly, I'll  be fantasizing about that one for awhile lol \n\nOn to the breakfast. I ordered a basic breakfast of eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage. It was exceptionally yummy for such a simple breakfast. You could tell that the quality of the food is really good but that goes for most of the food at the Wynn. My bf got the filet minion sliders.

The toast were also completely burnt, but we didn't ask them to replace them since we didn't want to take the chance of waiting even longer. My side order of onion rings came out before my main dish, which I found to be weird and they were more soggy than crispy. My main dish, a Ham & Cheese sandwich, didn't come out for another 20 minutes.\n\n3. The food was mediocre, but the last straw was when we waited 20 minutes for our bill.  We were at the cafe for about 2 hours, and 90 minutes of that was spent waiting including waiting to be seat). If the food was delicious, all may have been forgiven, but the food was mediocre and pricey considering quality and quanitity.\n\nI'm never eating here again."

I have a gluten sensitivity and they have a special food allergen menu, which was presented to me after being seated (thanks to my thoughtful boyfriend who told them about my special diet when he made the reservation!) so this wins big points from me, it's so rare to find a restaurant who even knows what I mean by gluten-free.  Our waitress and the whole wait-staff actually was spot on.  Oh, and, my boyfriend really liked the pretzel bread.  The prices are a bit, shall we say, Wynn.  (Hence the 4 stars and not 5.)

We did not have reservations, but were seated within minutes shortly after 9am. \n\nFirst things first - the coffee. THANK YOU for brewing the strongest cup of coffee during my entire trip in Vegas. Please teach everyone else in this town how to make coffee... (It can't be that hard, can it?)\n\nMy husband and I shared the monkey bread. He had the filet mignon steak and egg sliders, whileI had the free style eggs. The monkey bread was much too sweet for my taste - the cream cheese frosting was spread on super thick and the sugary crust stuck to my teeth. I felt like I was developing cavities on the spot... Good, but super sweet. Beware.\n\nMy eggs were sunny side up and they were perfect. The \"crispy bacon\" was actually crispy, and I enjoyed every single bite. What really stole the show were the fingerling potatoes. I wish I could eat them every single day. The most tender, soft, breakfast potatoes ever! \n\nHubs enjoyed his breakfast. He originally asked to replace the fingerling potatoes with the braised beef short rib hash, but our server probably didn't put in the order because he got the regular potatoes. No complaints though -- he loved them just as much as I did. \n\nOur server was nice. She refilled our water glasses a few times, but after we were served our meals, she didn't really come back to check on us. Overall decent and worth the visit for a nice breakfast. :)!"

My party of 5 had a reservation for 8pm, but was running late and as much as we expected to receive grief for bumping our RSVP by an hour on a busy Saturday night, we didn't get any. Instead, we were greeted by 2 very warm & smiley hostesses and got seated right away.\n\nWe started with a round of shots and appetizers which came out of the kitchen very quickly. We ordered mac and cheese bites, buttered asparagus and complimentary burnt breadsticks! The mac and cheese w/ dipping sauce was good but a bit heavy & the asparagus was perfectly sauteed.\n\nI got the grilled pepperoni flatbread and the tomato bisque. The flatbread was everything I had expected it to be: crunchy, the perfect portion and super tasty. The tomato bisque was a bit underseasoned but I did love the thick consistency. My group all got burgers and steaks cooked medium-rare and they were all cooked and tasted very tender and juicy!\n\nThe kitchen was also great in participating w/ a custom dessert made for the bachelorette at our table. They wrote \"Congratulations Linda!\" in chocolate icing on a deliciously tall, multi-tiered, chocolate madness of a cake and it was rich and delicious! The presentation was gorgeous, along with the rest of the food.\n\nSociety gets a 5 because I enjoyed myself there, and if I would have complained about any of the stuff that went wrong w/ the food, they would most likely have fixed it right away. However, because I was in such good spirits, great company and surrounded by such amazing service, the problems w/ the food weren't a huge deal."

This is the kind of place that you know is good, even if what you have doesn't quite hit the spot, and I am definitely itching to try this place again.\n\nFor lunch we started with the mac n cheese bites, which were incredible.  I then had the charred rare tuna sliders, which for me were a bit of a miss.  I'm generally a fan of tuna, but this was a bit of an adventure for me rather than going with a burger or the bbq pork sandwich, both of which I was eyeing heavily when browsing the menu.  The tuna sliders were wrapped in some amazing bao buns, but the tuna itself was overcooked and very tough and flavorless.  The wasabi creme was a miss as well, and just made each bite taste like you were chewing on a popsicle stick - unless you really like tuna, I would avoid these at all cost.\n\nThe [very big] redeeming quality of society cafe was the scale of the menu - there at least half a dozen other items that I'd like to try from here, and that is just the lunch menu, so I am sure I will be back, only next time I'll avoid the tuna."

Found this place last year when I visited Vegas, & every time I go back, I always make sure I have reservations there. First of all, the FOOD is phenomenal. I usually get the filet, add a mini crab cake. It never disappoints. Something the chef really knocks out of the park is his salads, specifically the vegan salads (which I add cheese and/or chicken to..) I don't know what magical land he comes from to have these ideas of marrying all these flavors together, but the vegan salads are amazing. The salads are something we always get, usually to share. I was there last weekend & opted out of my filet because I was so intrigued by the Superfood Salad, which was brand new on the menu that day.. I added chicken & Havarti, & haven't shut up about that salad since. I dream of Society's salads, & then try to recreate them. They come out good, but not the same. :)\n\nThe ambience of this place is really nice, & we've always had great service. They're very catering to customers. I've never been there for breakfast but will be going back for my birthday soon & decided breakfast will also be happening."

I found myself eating my omlette slower, just so I could savor the coffee. It was that good. \n\nWhat I really appreciated was that if you have any food allergies, the chef comes out and goes over the menu with you. It was a nice touch."

For the entree, the sandwiches are listed as \"slider\" (singular). When asked, the server did confirm that there was only 1 slider provided for the Restaurant week menu.\n\nDon't get me wrong but 1 slider/small sandwich, a side salad/soup, and three donut holes for $20.10? 'xcuse me... I thought this was Restaurant week, not Jenny Craig. Well, at least they threw in a couple of pretty tasty warm pretzel breadsticks with mustard butter but still. If  you ordered off their regular menu, the sloppy joes plus fries are only $14 - just saying.\n\nOkay, enough breathe and remind yourself that this is for charity. Breathe. On to the  food.\n\nAlthough it was nice to see they used real turkey in their turkey club sandwich, the turkey was rather dry. The sandwich was very unbalanced - too much filling for the size of the roll (1/3rd an avocado, a large amount of dry turkey, 2 slices of large tomato, plus 2 strips of bacon all squished into a roll.\n\nSalad was on the sweeter side but tasted pretty good. Good for the price? Not really. But regardless, it was good. My husband ordered the soup which he said was okay, not great.\n\nThe warm doughnut bites were good but weren't the best doughnut holes ever. The outside wasn't crispy enough while the texture of the doughnut was tad too dense and dry.\n\nOverall, okay food, exorbitant prices. A 3 star review."

Society is that casual joint, and one of the better ones out there, certainly besting the cafes at Bellagio, Venetian, Aria & sister Wynn.\n\nQuick tip... force yourself out of bed early (ahem) & be here by 11:30am.

Sitting in a high class spot like Encore and enjoying a meatless hamburger served up in a paper box with a chocolate milkshake and fries for $9 has a certain charm,. If you're vegetarian/vegan, I think it is an experience you should add to your \"must do\" while in Vegas. \n\nThe patty is by Gardein, and it is a-ok. Perhaps not the best meatless patty I have had, but not bad. Perhaps the burger could have a bit more cheese and a few more fresh toppings, lettuce, onions. I like a salad on my burger, but hey, it's $9 and comes with fries and a shake in a swanky spot. The fries are great, and the vegan chocolate milkshake is delicious, especially if you enjoy coconut.  \n\nAnother standout are the vegan desserts. Did you know that every chocolate chip cookie on Wynn properties is vegan...and delicious? Vegan sweet lovers will have no problem enjoying dessert here!\n\nI have also had the turkey burger at Society, and it wasn't my favorite. It was a little dry, and based on that dish, I wasn't itching to get back. \n\nHowever, I love the atmosphere, and I think the happy hour special is a notable treat. I will definitely bring my vegan/vegetarian friends here when they visit!"

I ordered the Kobe Burger, decently price, great presentation, but the patty was dry, and it's Kobe beef too so that's odd. I should have ordered it with Swiss cheese instead, the Blue Cheese was too over powering. The deep fried macaroni and cheese nibblets were yummy, not greasy and complimented well with the dipping sauce. Normally, I'm more generous with giving out stars, but I have to take away some for their outrageous \"service charge\" on top of their 18% gratuity tab. You would think that gratuity is the same thing as a service charge! All they did extra was push in your chair and fold your napkin when you stepped away from the table. I don't think everyone paying an additional fee at the table justifies this at all! This is the first restaurant I've been to that charges a fee on top of your gratuity. Another thing I didn't like was when I ordered a Redbull vodka the waiter suggested I'd just order a vodka shot and he'd bring me a Redbull on the side as a chaser since the Redbull vodka cocktail didn't have that much vodka in it. I thought this was nice of him to suggest that like he was looking out for my best interests, little did I know he suggested it so that I could be charged more! My Redbull was $5.50 on top of the vodka shot, no thank you! I felt like he should have told me up front I was ordering two separate drink items instead of making it sound like he was doing me some kind of favor. I guess this is how they make money back to afford high over head costs for their fancy hotel! Boo 2.5 stars only please!"

We started with the white sangria, which was phenomenal. Too often white sangrias are simply too sweet, but this sangria was well balanced in flavor, the cava gave it a nice fizz, and the Remy gave it a good richness and oaky notes. We ordered another round of those and for our third round we opted for the watermelon mojitos. Those were refreshing and tasty, yet I preferred the white sangria.\n\nFor HH food, they offered a list of 4 appetizers from which you can pick three, as well as a flatbread, two different slider options, and fish & chips. \nWe picked the Pulled Pork Sliders (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=7CQ7TrXhvD2k3-nuZk0DQw#o_dYFC2NbX9J2Fdfi4FeTQ) topped with virginia slaw and butter pickles and served with a side of sweet potato fries. The sliders were juicy and delicious, the slaw and pickles giving the mini burgers a good crunchy texture to offset the soft meat and sauce. I loved the crispy sweet potato fries and the mini bottle of ketchup that they serve on the side is just frickin' adorable! \n\nFrom the 4-option list of small appetizers, we picked the Mac 'N Cheese \"Bites\", the \"Lollipop\" Chicken Wings, and Grandma Rose's Meatballs, deciding to forgo the Crispy Rock Shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw?select=7CQ7TrXhvD2k3-nuZk0DQw#SifqxmBDGINvsYDstK_Qew). However, they punched our order in wrong and we received the rock shrimp instead of the meatballs. That was quickly rectified, although after seeing the caper aioli that was served alongside the shrimp, I was sad they took the dish away to swap it with the meatballs rather than letting us have both. \nThe Mac 'N Cheese Bites were definitely our favorite. Greasy pasta and cheese made into little tater tot battered looking things and served with an insane truffle dipping sauce. Once all the Bites were gone, we started dipping our sweet potato fries into the sauce. I then proceeded to dip my finger into the sauce to make sure none of the heavenly concoction was wasted. \nThe meatballs were pretty decent, but the tomato sauce lacked excitement. Maybe some spice could have helped elevate it to the next level. The buffalo chicken wings had a perfect spiciness to them and I'll never say no to cold blue cheese dipping sauce!\n\nHaving read about their amazing pretzel bread on other Yelp reviews while sipping on our cocktails, I asked the bartender for some. She said they usually only serve it with dinner, but she made an exception and got us an order. The bread was warm, had a good saltiness in the pretzel dough and was paired with an amazing mustard butter.\n\nI would certainly come back for the food and would definitely come back for more sangria! The decor here is stunning, making want that interior decorator for my place! Cream walls and ceilings, black & white curtains draped everywhere and nicely accented red couches make this place super chic and modern."

Everyone was very pleased with their meals and portions were fabulous. With that being said, we had some of the worst service ever. We were a party of 12 for a bachelorette dinner and requested a certain table upon making the reservations. We were told that table was unavailable when we arrived, and were sat elsewhere. Ok, no big deal. Then we sat for about 15 minutes before ANYTHING happened. No water, no drink orders, no bread, nothing. Once we placed our drink orders, it was about a half hour before any of them came. In fact, they came AFTER some of the appetizers. Entrees came after awhile also, but no appetizer plates were cleared so there was no room on the table. Some peoples' sides were incorrect, but the food was great so we tried to power through. Everything was SO slow that we were there for over two hours. When we asked to speak to the manager, he couldn't have cared less that we were disappointed. All in all the food was great but we were so surprised that the service was so bad. If our server was new, I understand it. But considering we didn't really have any crazy requests or substitutions or anything it was pretty bad."

I had dinner here around 9pm on a Saturday night and only waited a few minutes for a table.  I also had breakfast here at 9am on a Sunday morning (with a reservation) and it was steady, but not insanely packed.  The decor was bright and trendy with a good vibe.  \n\nNow, onto the food....\n\nOn my first visit I had the vegan tomato bisque as an appetizer -it was fantastic!  I was shocked that it was vegan, but still so creamy!  For my entree I had the Wynn \"burger\" with fries and raspberry sorbet.  The burger was good, Gardein \"beef\" patty, vegan cheese and all the typical burger toppings and a side of fries.  Very tasty and easy on the wallet.  Usually it comes with a shake, but I don't like chocolate so the server offered sorbet instead...it was great!  The burger, fries and shake meal is only $11!  With my soup my total was a little over $22, but that's cheap for a Vegas meal!  \n\nOnto my breakfast the next day...\n\nI started with a green juice for $10.  I'm a big green juice fan, so $10 for a fresh juice didn't seem too bad.  Well, this is where Society gets knocked down a star.  I saw the bartender pour it in my glass from a big plastic jug under the bar.  For $10/glass I think it should have been fresh pressed!!  \n\nFor my entree I had the Florentine Tofu Benedict.  It was really good and a healthy option as well.  It had a great smokey flavor and I really enjoyed it.  It came with a cucumber salad on the side, which was okay, but I think a side of fresh fruit would have been a better choice.  With my juice and Benedict, my total was about $28 before tip.  A little pricy due to the juice situation, but I was still pleased."

Mmmmmm. \n\nFor takeout the same day I ordered the Greek kale salad w grilled chicken. Chicken  was juicy and tender. Kale and grapes w smoked almonds was refreshing w a slight bite from the pickled onions. So good. Enjoyed it poolside. \n\nOur service was also great. Try were nice and prompt , refilled waters timely, asked about allergies. Offered a coffee refill to go. \n\nA bit overpriced but overall great"

I highly recommend the traditional eggs Benedict and the monkey bread appetizer. \n\nTip: there is a dress code and women can't wear spaghetti strap tank tops-- we learned that lesson the hard way. \n\nI had the chopped salad that was very nice. I the balsamic vinaigrette.\n\nThe service was excellent. \n\nThis is a very relaxing place for lunch. \n\nFor my wife it was a five for me it was a 4. And because I down up I give it a 4"

Breakfast the next morning at the Terrace in the Wynn, although a couple dollars less expensive, was not nearly as good nor as nice of an experience, by a long shot."

I love the concept of the caf\u00e9 and the entire ambiance is seriously amazing! If you hadn't experienced it then you definitely missed out! For starters when we walked in we were warmly greeted by a couple of very friendly hostess! Timing was awesome because we were seated immediately and without a reservation! Double plus! The waiter was great he had a lot of insight to the menu as well as very helpful with his recommendations! I started with the Blueberry margarita which isn't something I normally do, I prefer just a straight up traditional margarita but tonight I was getting a bit out of my comfort zone! Freshly made and the blueberries were crushed to perfection! Shaken well! Yum! The complimentary pretzel bread is really good minus ALL THAT SALT! Yikes! My friends ordered the fried macaroni cheese bites as an appetizer and WOW! I hope that when they move this caf\u00e9 to where Botero use to be then these are a KEEPER on the new menu! As an entr\u00e9e I went for the Southwest Burger and again another great recommendation by our waiter it was again made to perfection! No complaints at all! We also ordered a side of the Orecchiette Mac n cheese! I'm more of a truffle Mac n Cheese kinda guy but this did just fine! And lastly the famous chocolate cake that towers over you was literally some of the best chocolate cake I've ever had! Wish I tried this place out sooner!"

We just had a delicious breakfast at the Society Cafe. The vegetable flatbread was amazing.  My wife had a chopped salad with avacado and a refreshing lemon tarragon dressing. The service was excellent."

I really didn't like it. My husband didn't even touch it at all, the panini bread is really hard, like a rock. My in laws had the steak & egg -$24.... \nI don't think I'd go back again, the price and the entrees didn't have that type of \"wow\" effect."

Creme brulee cheesecake. You absolutely must try it, and the warm doughnuts with dipping sauces are also fantastic.\n\nOrder dessert first, then maybe a meal if you are still hungry."

The drinks were a little expensive but the plates are worth splitting and the drinks are good! The sangria at the bar was really good!  Not to pricey which is nice to have in Vegas! I felt like i was on the set of Gosip Girl with the atmosphere! I loves it here."

The problem here was the service and the fact that they ran out of apple juice and sticky buns by 11AM. Our waiter also kept messing up our orders and was forgetful about refills, etc.  Not only did they run out of apple juice they ended up stlil charging us 10 bucks for it.  The experience was a bit painful."

            "review": "Good food aplenty at this upscale yet casual cafe at the Encore (Wynn) right next to the club XS.  Simple, priced right, and a nice standard beer menu to wash it down.\n\nIf you are a truffling ho like me (not to be confused with a \"trifling ho\"), Society's menu will have you tricking with your mouth in two seconds flat.  Liberal administration of truffle oil / butter / miscellaneous creamy goodness will have you so weak at the knees I can hardly speak I lose all control then something takes over me.  SWV!\n\nBut all kidding aside, truffling hoes will want to avail yourselves and open your mouths to receive the culinary prowess I suggest to the following items you must say yes.  (repeat this sentence in your best Spoken Word voice).\n\nItem Number 1 - The Mac & Cheese Bites.  Every fat kid loves him some Mac & Cheese, and as a former man-breast recipient, I am no except to this rule.  But just like a nice, plump, man-breast, every classic dish needs a nice, hard twist.  Here's Society's twist on Mac & Cheese:  They place their Mac & Cheese into magically delicious and geometrically perfect cubes (with batter of some sort), and fry the living daylights out of them.  The result is a double whammy of flavor, first of the miscellaneous fried pleasure that can make the fishiest of fish and the blandest of vegetables taste like heaven (or I guess, hell, for you goth kids that can't relate), and second, of the Mac & Cheese, duh.  AND I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE BEST PART YET!  You dip the Mac & Cheese bites into a truffle oil / butter / sauce concoction!  What happens next, in your mouth, folks, is mindblowing.  Not quite as mindblowing as Ricky Martin coming out of the closet, but mindblowing nonetheless.  \n\nItem Number 2 - The Trenne.\n\nI'm all about portmanteaus - \"shart\" being a particular favorite of mine.  But \"trenee\" is definitely a close second.  It is a combination of \"triangle\" and \"penne\" and explains the peculiarly-shaped pasta used in this dish.  It is, well, triangular penne.  Kind of like a hollow prism.  Actually, exactly like a hollow prism.  But I digress - the shape of the pasta has nothing to do with the flavor of this dish.  This pasta dish is served with a truffle cream sauce, crispy prosciutto, real truffles, and peas.  Men - I can all but guarantee that this dish will get you laid.  Women - I can all but guarantee that some man will read my review and buy you this dish.\n\nTheir bone-in peppercorn dry-rub rib-eye (say that ten times fast) is spectacular too, but c'mon, who writes about steak these days?  That was so 2004.\n\nThis place left a good taste in my mouth.  So good, in fact, that I didn't brush my teeth last night so I could taste it in the morning.  \n\nI will be back, Society Cafe Encore, I will be back.\n\nHappy truffling!"
