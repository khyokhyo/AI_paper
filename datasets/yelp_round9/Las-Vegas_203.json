The Mexican street corn is delicious with char that was just right, while their tacos were great. Had the two taco combo with ribeye and chicken taco--deliciosa!! Great combination of flavors. And don't miss the chips-- we had two baskets with their excellent green chili salsa."

My friend and I ordered their nachos with Barbacoa and chips and guacamole. The gauc was so bomb. Its a must have. Although the service wasn't as great as the other location, the food is great always. Plus we went on a Sunday and it was happy hour all day which made it better! A definite great place to eat, drink, and be it casual."

Just for checking in to yelp I received a complimentary order of their street corn right on the cobb with the husk still attached. I really enjoyed the atmosphere as well. Just a great place for great food, family and friends to hang out."

The menu is a bit strange in its format, but once you figure it out it is fine. It is divided into protein, style, sauces, etc that you basically \"build your own\" - I did a simple fish tacos, my friend did a pork rice bowl. You get the idea. They are all $9.95 (with upgrade options)\n\nThe food was good. I think I liked my tacos better than my friend liked his rice bowl. The endless salsa bar was a great addition. They had some awesome flavors available, from super hot to smokey roasted. The salsas helped kick up the flavor!\n\nService was surprisingly attentive. Even though it was clear that our server was running around helping a very busy dining room. Really, she was hustling that room, and doing a great job in the process!\n\nOverall, it was good. I would go back because it is close and I like Boca Mall shops. If it was opposite side of the city, not sure I would venture just for this."

            "review": "I feel torn between 3-4 stars for this place. But I'll go with 3. \n\nWe bought a Groupon ($20 for $40) which was good. Started with the guac for $5.95 which comes with bottomless chips and salsa. The guac was good, not great. It was heavy on the tomatoes which I'm not a fan of. But it's a good price for an easy app. Also comes with chicharrones on the side. Never had a pork rind in my life, but gotta be honest- they're pretty good. Almost like rice cakes with more flavor. The actual chips that come with the salsa trio are not great. \n\nMy husband had the vegetarian chimichanga. He really liked his, although wish it came with rice/beans or anything on the side. I ordered the carne asada fajitas. The meat was delicious, flavorful and cooked to perfection. I was not a fan of the rice or beans. But the onions, peppers, corn and potatoes were seasoned well and a nice side. Tortillas were delicious. \n\nWe also had a pitcher of margaritas that a friend helped us with. The pitcher was 36.00 and was worth with it. \n\nWe sat at the bar and the bartender was really nice and helpful. I guess the vibe seemed dull to me, being we were some of the only people in the restaurant at that time. The story behind Hussong's is actually really interesting and being that's it's one of only a couple others aside from the original in Mexico, I would think they would have gone with a more authentic decor. Just my take.  Would probably go back again, only with another Groupon."

            "review": "It opened on Monday and I visited on Friday July 24th around 7:30pm.\n\nI came in the back door and sat down at the bar. I used to frequent this place when it was Embers so the changes in the place were interesting to see, with the removal of the wall separating the bar and dining tables, as well as lighter wood stains and red upholstery on the chairs. Lots of random pictures and posters adorn the walls. The bar has two hanging bottle displays with different tequilas in them. I really liked the interior as it seemed lighter and fresher.\n\nBartender Justin spotted me and came over to take my order. He recommended an \"original\" margarita so I went with it ($10.95). He gave me some good recommendations on tacos as well since I don't like spicy food. Tacos are 2 for $9.95. I missed out on the Happy Hour menu which has discounts for drinks only.\n\nOriginal Margarita - I'm not a huge margarita fan, I usually enjoy tequila as a shot. This was ok, nothing special in my book. \n\nTacos - I went with a chicken taco that comes with fresh pineapple on top, and the pork belly taco (extra $1). Both were plenty big and very well made with lots of meat. The pork belly taco was delicious with a sweet marinade sauce and some crispy pork rinds on top. \n\nService was great, Justin kept using my name during conversations, and checking up frequently and keeping my water glass full. The other bartender whose name I don't remember didn't hardly even look my way, nor smile much while she was working the other side of the bar. There was a manager guy there who seemed like he was watching the bartenders work and he also didn't smile much or seem to have much customer connection. \n\nOverall, I'll probably come back during Happy Hour when drink prices are a little more reasonable. One thing I did notice was the bartenders shirts said \"Serving up fun since 1932\" or some year, yet the place didn't really seem all that fun. It seemed like a business."

My wife and I ordered an array of tacos, The ribeye taco, Kung pow shrimp taco, barbacoa taco,& The chicken taco. Ribeye taco was dry this is their version of carne asada. We also had the mango habanero guacamole. The flavor had no hints of mango taste like regular guacamole. The rest of the tacos were greasy overpriced and had little seasoning. The restaurant is known for inventing the original margarita, so I thought I'd give it a try. They definitely want to charge you for the history and a margarita was quite underwhelming. Now onto the service. Number one, the manager never checked to see if our food was any good and asked us if this was our first time, Which replied yes it was. The order taker thinks speed equates to service my wife and I could not understand a thing that was coming out of her mouth. The food expediter didn't explain one taco and placed my wife's napkin in the guacamole and just walked off. Please do not waste your time with this restaurant."

The rice has no flavor for \"cilantro lime\"...Chipotle is better.  2nd the margaritas are awesome and strong (maybe so you get drunk and forget that the beans are probably chilli from a can?). So, go here fo the bar and NOT for the beans. The steak tacos were good but we just couldn't get over the beans and rice...yuck!

Five mouthfuls from a ten dollar pint is nearly laughable. \n\nMaybe if it were half price would I give this place three stars. Subpar beans and rice in tiny portions only serve to make the nearly average tacos seem nice by comparison. \n\nThe staff seems to be trying to make up for the shortcomings of this place, but it's a shame it probably won't last long enough to make their training time worth it. Their enthusiasm gives this place one star above the minimum."

Not only did I have to pay extra for chips and salas at a \"Mexican\" restaurant but I also waited 48 mins for some tacos just for them tacos to be dry, no flavor & definitely not worth $54 of food at Happy Hour at that. Last time I waste my money there! Try Javier's that's real Mexican!"

The food, for us has never been the problem, the service however, that's another story.\n\nAnd it's not the fault of the servers! Management needs to get a clue, and have a hostess seating people, that's how you avoid two  people sitting at six tops and making your larger parties wait for tables. Do not let people seat themselves, its a mess. Also, give your servers a busser, we were there during their happy hour on a Monday and it was busy, but the only had 3 servers working, and no bussers, and no one seating people. That's why it takes 20 minutes to get drinks out. Its not fair to your servers, as it effects their tips and their ability to make money.\n\nBathroom trash was overflowing, and there were crushed chips  all over the floor at the waiters station.\n\nThis place could be great if management gave their staff the tools to succeed."

Luckily it took them less than 10 minutes for them to get out the 3 tacos but the tortilla was not even cooked all the way and the tacos were not even hot. Didnt even really check up on us, didnt seem sincere about the timing, no compensation, and even short changed me. Im not the type to look for dicounts but at least seem like you care that your guests are not happy.

I said thank you that was nice of you and nothing no thank you good night just weird bad customer service. \n\nWhen I got home to eat there were not two sides if rice and they gave me the Vegan Burrito that I specifically said I did NOT want. It was an awful burrito. I didn't eat it. It was full of green chiles and I was so dissapointed because I drove super far out of my way to go there. The experience was lack luster. I didn't eat my ten dollar burrito. And my friend didn't get anything because they didn't add the rice. \n\nThe food itself is good but they have to get there service on point to make this location successful. It'll take more than a good happy hour. \n\nIf owners are reading this and you need a new training manager call me.

Basic tacos are $3, special happy hour drinks are $5-$7, chips and salsa is .95 and guacamole is $2.45. There are also items for happy hour on the menu. The drinks are strong but not over the top. The bottomless chips and salsa are good - you choose your salsa from a salsa bar and the guacamole is fresh and well made, but a small portion. The steak taco I had was a bit on the spicy side. The taco was decent sized, but I felt it could have a had a bit more meat. We also had a chicken quesadilla melt, which was delicious. The service was uneven. Our first server was on top of things, but we ended up having to move tables, and the second server was not very visible. Overall, the prices made up for the small issues. We will come back again for happy hour."

Mexican corn is a truly odd experience for a Midwestern kid who was raised on corn-on-the-cob. Back home, the only way people cooked corn-on-the-cob was in a pot of boiling water, a method which all but removes every bit of flavor from the corn (it's a wonder I wasn't culinarily scarred for life). \n\nForgive the tangent here, but if I could travel back in time, I would go back to my grade school self and introduce myself to Mexican Corn (and then we would explode into non-existence when we make contact in the congratulatory high five).\n\nNeedless to say, there is a reason the Mexican Corn is pretty much the only picture on the menu. No matter what else you try, you need to try the Mexican Corn.\n\nHouse picked two tacos for me and kept the margaritas flowing. I will honestly admit I cannot remember which tacos I got, but that may be due to House's master mixology skills. I can say, without a doubt, that they were two of the best I have ever had.\n\nThe prices here are quite high, which is the sole reason for the missing star. I'm not completely saying the price point doesn't match the food and service quality, but the prices need to come down a little bit to be a 5 star joint, especially on the \"Original Margarita\", which hits you at a whopping $10 a piece. \n\nBut the good news, happy hour has the \"Original Margarita\" at half price. Guess where you'll be finding me from now on?"

No one had come into check in us or even walked by us so we couldn't ask for hot sauce to mask the sadness of the tacos. \n\nAlso, the seats and tables were dirty when we were seated. Water was brought out in a cup that has old food residue on the bottom of the cup and on the sides. \n\nDirty dining, indeed."

The atmosphere is nothing special, the decorations are ugly, but the real review is for the shitty tasting food and the wrong amount charged to my card. I'm not sure how my server, Jonathan could misinterpret a $6.00 tip to a $15.00 tip. My card was over charged by $9.00. The food was horrible. I got the 3 enchiladas and my wife got the 3 soft tacos. Both plates were pretty spicy. That is not disclosed on the menu. Their rice is overly drenched in lime and their churro dessert was mushy. I wouldn't recommend them at all and we'll see if they're prompt on refunding my money back."

A colleague and I were joking and saying how a drive-through Alberto's is better than anything in this town. Well, I have to say I am rather impressed.\nThe ambiance is very casual, which is wonderful for lunch. Don't know how the restaurant is during dinner time (since Boca Park restaurants are a zoo during dinner and weekends). \nWe had two servers, one who greeted us, gave us the history of the restaurant, explained the menu and made some recommendations. The service was on point, enough attention not pushy or overly annoying- just perfect. The chips were fresh and very delicious. The array of salsas that we could choose from was plentiful. I really like the spicier choices. Their original margarita was wonderful. I ordered the combo tacos (Baja shrimp and Carne Asada). Baja shrimp was best outside of Baja, Mexico. Carne Asada one was filled with flavor. I really enjoyed the beans, they were creamy and delicious. \nExcellent food paired with great service!"

He lingered and my husband asked if he was a manager or owner...he said YES I AM THE MAN! My husband then made small talk about never knowing with all these reality shows and youtube tricks...the owner (Brian) then asked AGAIN for the menu. He responded no thank you. Brian lingered again and asked AGAIN. I said- he just told you no...he'd like to order more, spend more money. Brian then proceeded to tell us loudly in front of many other tables I JUST BOUGHT THOSE NEW MENUS AND I'M JUST WATCHING BEANS ON THEM! I sort of laughed and said that they were the washable kinds of menus and that he was being ridiculous.

Zero buzz was had.\n\nChips and salsa next. They brought out a tray of three different types of salsa that i guess maybe they make there? Pineapple, Chipotle and Habanero. The only remotely good one was the habanero. The other two were literally so awful we didn't touch them after one taste. \n\nOn recommendation from the server, I ordered the pork belly tacos. My wife ate the carne asada tacos. Both dishes lacked serious flavor, and the pork belly, for some reason, was diced up extremely small in the taco. When ive had pork belly, its always been whole so you can really get the flavor and texture from the fat and the meat. This was just strange. \n\nAt the very end of the meal, our waitress finally brought us the waters we asked for when we ordered the Sangria. We were already paying the bill. Thanks for that.\n\nAlso, WAY overpriced."

I said no only the one in Mexico. She then proceeded to tell us how to order food/drinks from the walk up counter and we would be given a table # Flag, then we could sit anywhere we like and the food/drinks would be brought out. \n\n*TIP: Be sure to tell the staff when ordering you would like to keep your tap open if you want more drinks. \n\nWe did not order food but certainly ordered The Original Margarita to see if it lived up to its Standard in Mexico! Drinks were on Happy Hour Special 3-6pm M-F. \n\nAs we sat on patio the drinks were quickly severed and they were certainly strong and tasty! Not quite as strong as the Mexico drinks, however, in there defense, that was Mexico :-)\n\nThe food looked good and will certainly be back to try that! There is a center bar located inside the restaurant along with a few TV's which has sports playing at the time. \n\nAgain, I am fan overall and happy this place is near by at Boca Park, next to Pink Berry and Total Wine and Spirits."

My husband got a Barbacoa and carnitas! The carnitas was good as well and had pork grinds sprinkled on top. Nice touch!!!! We noticed that happy hour is ALL day Sunday! We decided we will be going back on Sunday. It's our new spot and we couldn't be happier. By the way...the staff and manager on duty were super friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!!! See y'all again soon!!!!"

But we we're excited to find a place that has tacos and happy hour. I would totally come back for just beer, chips and salsa. The food was nothing special and service lacked. Not sure if our waitress was training or not cause we saw someone shadow her a few times but if that the case I blame her trainer. It was too slow to receive the service we received. Love the area and so close to home but doubt we will be back. I hope they are able to turn things around."

It took someone 10 minutes to approach us. We were not told about the self service chips and salsa until we asked for some. At that point we were told we have to get it ourselves. Weird. When we ordered we watched the waitress walk around for 5 minutes before putting our order in. After we were done eating it took another 15 minutes to get our check. The wait wouldn't have been a problem if they were busy but they weren't. Also the food wasn't great. My chimichanga wasn't cooked all the way and the cheese dip was not your normal Mexican queso dip. I wasn't a fan."

I asked for some water as she was walking off and she finally brought some a while later.  She also never once came over to ask if we wanted refills.  Third, the food was not good. I got the burrito and it was the driest burrito I've ever had, no sour cream or anything, just the burrito.  My date got the cheese enchiladas and I could tell he wasn't that pleased with his either, but he still finished it.  I didn't even eat half of mine, even though I was starving. Over all this was probably the worst Mexican food I have had and nice had some pretty bad stuff before."

I was expecting small street tacos so I ordered 3.. 2 was enough. The tacos were pretty good-- definitely on the more TexMex meets new America side. I think I liked the chicken taco best. Their pinapple salsa is very good as is their free chips.\n\nThe place gets a little warm inside since it's an open space that connects to their patio.

She had chips and a water.  She said the hostess told her it would be about 15 minutes before a server got to her so I arrived in that 15 minute window and still no server. After about 10 additional minutes and making eye contact with what appeared to be a couple servers on the patio still nothing.  I flagged someone down and asked if we could place a drink order.  She said who's your server, and we responded we did not have one to which she responded, how did you get the chips then. I mean why are we being questioned how chips appeared on our table.  So needless to say it didn't start off too well.  So this person became our server by default.  According to my receipt her name was Jasmine.  \n\nWe ordered tacos, quesadilla, guacamole and queso, which was free via Yelp check in. The guacamole was good but I was not a fan of the queso and would not order it again even for free.  I enjoyed the frozen swirl margarita which is the traditional margarita with flavor of choice mixed in.  I tried the raspberry and strawberry.   I like the salsa bar choices versus most restaurants that offer spicy or mild.  \n\nDuring our time there two parties had dogs so the patio is dog friendly and I am a fan of that.  Overall, I was not a fan of the initial slow service but once Jasmine became our server we didn't have any other issues and she was helpful making recommendations.  This is a chain restaurant so the food is not mind blowing but add in the drinks and it's a decent happy hour option."

Am I at a sit down restaurant or a Cafe Rio/Chipotle? The menu felt confusing and was ridiculously limited. It basically is a Chipotle with booze, except the food at Chipotle is way better. \n\nI had the carnitas salad, which consisted of romaine lettuce, pickled onions, carnitas and some awful pork rind thingies. Nothing particularly interesting, inventive or good about it. The food came quickly and the margarita was fine. \n\nAnother thing that bugged me was one of the giant TVs was tuned to a network evening news program. I don't know about you, but when I want drinks and fun evening out, seeing various dramas/tragedies being broadcast doesn't exactly add to my experience. This was a one and done for me, I won't be back."

The shell was that awkward in between.. Was it hard? Was it soft? It was like a soft tortilla was half way fried. Not good. The fillings were minimal. The Barbacoa filling was delicious but again the shell Was confusing. \n\nSalsa was normal, nothing super tasty. Chicken quesadilla was amazing. The aioli inside was chipotle. Tangy goodness. Margarita was good too but it wasn't out of the ordinary since it was a margarita mix. The Elote was good but I've had better on street corners. There just wasn't enough sauces on it to balance the char. Good but not great. Pretty good price wise since it was free when you check in on Yelp. \n\nThe prices are affordable here, especially since Sunday all day is happy Hour specials. Also, Monday through Friday is happy hour 3-6. I would only come back for happy Hour."

Not a fan of this...especially if you're charging $10 for 2 tacos w rice and beans (add $$ if you want a 3 taco plate). The salsa is a self serve salsa bar with 4 types of salsa. A mild pico de gallo red (meh), tomatillo (the best option), a spicy red sauce (2nd best option), and the fourth was a spicy green. \n\nBottom line, the food wasn't exceptional and it cost $38 +tip for x2 3 taco plates with rice and beans with chips/salsa and 2 beers. Not cheap for a Mexican style lunch. I should mention they have cheaper prices on the menu for happy hour (3-6pm), but I wouldn't make a special trip for HH."

Some may be turned off the the over-flare-ification of the interior or the high-priced Mexican fare (at least compared to hole-in-the-wall spots). But, the tacos and street corn won me over. The char and prominent cotija flavor of the former make it worth getting, especially when it's free for checking in. \n\nAs for the tacos, the pork belly is my favorite. Balanced sweet and savoriness, varied texture with the cabbage mix and most importantly it was topped with chicharrones. What's not to like? The barbacoa was a close runner-up. Who cares if it was messy with its sauce dripping everywhere. It's still bold flavored and delicious. \n\nLess noteworthy, but still decent were the chicken tacos and carnitas. Taco platters come with two tacos, which you can mix-and-match. Rice and beans can be hit or miss. The first time around the rice was better than almost any rice I've tried at a Mexican restaurant -- light, fluffy and buttery. The second time around... not so much. Still, Hussongs is a worthy spot to hit up as long as you don't mind paying a little more for tacos.\n\n3.5 Stars"

First when I walked in I stood there waiting for someone to say Hi or even notice I was there but that did not happen. Asked the lady standing there too if she could seat me and she laughed and said she was hoping I could do that as she was a customer too. Finally saw the sign to go to the counter and headed that way. \nServer at counter said Hi then I asked her to explain this concept and she did. Somewhat I got from her was basically this is a cafeteria  with a bar. You order from service counter then get a long stick with a number of  it and then go sit down. Some drinks come from  the bar and some they give you before you leave the counter where you also pay before you leave there. Sat \u00e0t the bar and bartender served my beer then the counter person brought our food out on a tray and took long stick with number. Really felt very cafeteria  style  and had ordered the steak nachos. Not the worse I have had but then again not the best. While at bar I kept noticing how people kept walking in and just looking lost like I did. \nProbably will not returned as the experience was not anything worth a second visit. The concept is not what I would describe friendly,  warm or even welcoming."

Their margaritas were voted the best in vegas this year by the lvrj and I'm not going to argue. \nWe came in here after a bad experience at a Mexican place down the street in Tivoli village."

Growing up in LA, I know good Mexican food and was really looking forward to trying them out; I was NOT disappointed!  \n\nYou enter the door and go straight to the counter to place your order.  Their prices are economical and comparable to Chipotle or Qdoba, but oh-so-much better!  My fianc\u00e9 had the carnitas tacos with rice and beans ($9.95) plus the bottomless chips and salsa for $1.95 (freshly made chips and a salsa bar for the grazing...good stuff!).  I had the chicken bowl, which included chicken, cilantro-lime rice, cheese, pineapple (it also comes with guac and onions, but I got it without).  it was delicious and a heaping portion!  I couldn't have been happier!  Speaking of happy, we were there during Happy Hour and though there are no food specials, the drinks are half off and with that, I had one of the best Margaritas I've ever had!  The beer selection is good and the well tequila was really, really good.  \n\nWe were there on their grand opening night (and totally by accident) and the service was ON POINT!  Every staff member we had contact with was friendly and happy; the manager and several other servers in the bar area kept checking back with us to make sure we had everything we needed and if everything was perfect.  Very attentive and genuinely concerned about our experience.  \n\nA great experience and we will come back again and again!!!"

Me and my Co workers thought we would be able to receive our free street corn for checking in on Yelp but because we were using a Groupon we weren't able to redeem both deals. I think if I were to go without the Groupon this place would be way too expensive for Mexican food. I didn't like the fact that you had to pay for bottomless chips and salsa either. Their salsa was good but not anything remarkable about it. I ordered the chimichanga with carnitas and red sauce and the burrito was great. I love the red sauce sort of thick so it was perfect for me. The rice however wasn't anything special, very basic. I did however get their street corn and that was great! Probably the best thing there! All in all I think this place was great but a little pricey for Mexican food. If we hadn't used a Groupon our meal would have probably been around $60"

That's exactly what I did at Hussong's. \n\nMy wife and I ordered chicken nachos, steak tacos, chips and guacamole, and tried all of their salsas at the salsa bar. \n\nMy wife and I only ate half of a steak taco, three nacho chips, two bites of guacamole, and a few dips of salsa. Everything but the chips was terrible. The chips were just standard low end chips.\n\nThe nachos, chicken, and salsas can be summed up with the phrase, \"what is that flavor?\" For the chicken it was something red that doesn't quite taste like tomatoes. For the fresca salsa it was something that tasted like tomatillo but not, and was much stronger. For the hotter salsas it was something that reminded me of a mole, a deep rich flavor that clashed hard with the salsa. For the nachos it was a combo of whatever makes the chicken gross and something green that I have no idea what to compare to. \n\nThe steak tacos were a complete joke. Easily some of the lowest quality meat we've had. Even by Mexican restaurant standards. We weren't expecting filet or ribeye, but this meat was just pure gristle and tendon. Totally unacceptable. \n\nFinally the guacamole. It might as well have been a bowl of cilantro. There was so much cilantro it was completely inedible for both of us. My wife looked at me incredulously when I called it \"inedible\". Sometimes when it comes to cilantro I can exaggerate a bit. So she took a bite, looked at me with a funny look on her face, and said, \"wow, you're right: inedible.\"\n\nIn the end -- about 4 minutes after the beginning -- we got up, still hungry, and walked away from a still-full table of terrible food.\n\nI lost $30 so you don't have to. You're welcome."

Only the Original Margarita is discounted (down to $5), and it's a full-sized glass instead of the typical lowball glass one might expect. I don't know if I'd splurge the $10+ for a specialty version, but the lychee one sounds delicious.\n\nFood menu is pretty basic, with two-taco plates running $10, additional options for burritos and nachos. They get bonus points for offering vegetarian options and barbacoa, which has been difficult to find in Las Vegas- their version isn't great, but it's adequate. The $7 order of nachos (+$2 for protein) is on par with Chipotle in terms of size, taste, and price. \n\nThe service was really great, Mario and his sidekick were friendly and outgoing and checked up on us frequently. Aside from that, this place was a bit more average than I had hoped for. Considering Hussong's has been around 120+ years, the food was very Americanized... as were the prices."

Despite its rich long term history due to its namesake and original location, this restaurant seems like it just tries too hard to be hip and cool and ends up resembling something more like Carl's Jr. but lacking the cheap eats value. \n\nWhen you enter, you are asked to order from a counter. Then you can opt for \"full service\" where the waitstaff will supposedly check on you and refill your drinks. To opt for this service you must leave a CC at the counter to establish an open tab, regardless of whether or not you accrue additional charges. Then once you order, you are given a number and told your food will be delivered to your table. How they know who is \"full service\" and who isn't I have no idea and it didn't really matter anyway as we left a CC with them yet not ONCE did a waiter come by to offer refills or check on us. \n\nWe left the table to refill our own drinks from the soda fountain and collect our CC prior to departure. The best value we experienced here was our lack of need to tip. \n\nOverall, the only reason I gave a 2 star instead of 1 is I did enjoy the overall aesthetics. The kitschy 80's and 90's era toys like Stay Puft Marshmallow man and PeeWee Herman doll were nostalgic and cute. But when it comes to the food and service, stick to Carl's Jr. At least when they deliver the food they usually ask if you need anything else. Hussong's could learn a few things from them."

That has got to be the worst restaurant I've eaten at since I've been in Vegas 12 years & I eat out a lot ! There's a lot of great restaurants in this town & I can honestly say this has been THE ONLY bad restaurant we've been to...so what does that tell you??\nThe whole experience was terrible...starting with their salsa sauce! How do you mess that up? They do....\nIt's tangy & tart...I didn't taste any garlic or cilantro...very bland & tangy ...no zip to it! And for starters, they are the only place I know that charges for chips & salsa in a Mexican restaurant . It's only $1.95, but it's the principle , & their chips are aweful too! Thick & hard...I like thin & airy chips.\nSo that's the 1st 2 things wrong. I order a frozen margarita, it comes out on the rocks, so I send it back. The guy brings it out to me frozen, but with no garnish?? Maybe they're saving their limes...who  knows, but I take the 1st sip, & my mouth started to draw up on the sides from it being so tart, so I bring it to the bar & asked the guy if he could put more triple sec in it to sweeten it up a bit & he takes the drink from my hands & goes behind the bar & puts a topper of triple sec in my drinks & hands it back to me...all with not saying 2 words to me! I stir it up, taste it, but couldn't tell a difference, so I said I need more in it. Let me drink it down a bit so you can add some more. He seemed annoyed that I was even asking, but I went to hand him my glass again, but instead he reaches down for a shot glass & fills it 1/2 full w triple sec & I said that's perfect & picked the shot glass up & walked back to my table. That's when I realized this guy has got an attitude, cause this whole process has gone on & still not one word from him! As a paying customer, he made me feel like I was a pain in the ass, but the real truth is....if they had a good bartender that knew how to make drinks, I wouldn't be bothering him to fix this drink that sucks, cause my drink would be spot on!\n\nNext, we order our food...Dom & I both order cheese enchiladas. I ordered mine w extra cheese & green sauce. I ask our server what kind of cheese do you have...cheddar, Jack ? She says no we don't have either of those...we use this Mexican cheese blend, so I said ok, not really knowing what these enchiladas are going to look like. She walks off & Dominic says to me \"if they don't have cheese, then how are they making our cheese enchiladas\" & I said good question. I get up from the table & walk over to her as she's putting our order in & I ask her that question. She says well, it's a blend that we use & I said does it melt? Cause I like a stretchy cheese on mine & she says yea, it melts & I said ok & don't forget extra cheese on mine & she says yes I know. The meal comes out & mine looks exactly like doms...- no extra cheese, both had a drizzle of a thin white sauce on top. There is NO CHEESE AT ALL THAT WAS VISABLE....huh ? None on top of the enchiladas nor on the refried beans...NO WHERE! I  don't say anything & we both start eating & Dom says this tastes like shit & I said I was thinking the same thing...but didn't want to complain since I already started off complaining about my margarita , but when he said that , I said OMG , I was  thinking the same thing! I thought it was just me thinking this food just doesn't taste right, but we both were on the same page ! That Mexican cheese they used to make the enchiladas sucks! No cheese on top & the extra sauce I ordered (green sauce) that she charged me for...I never touched cause that too was very tart & sucked! It was so dark green, I thought maybe it was seaweed pur\u00e9ed ...lol , no kidding...that's their green sauce...dark & tangy!\nWhen I tell you nothing was good in this place...I mean it!!!\nThis place is not a true authentic Mexican restaurant ...I think maybe they're from the Middle East & that's middle eastern  food or cook  we had...look at the name \"Hussong's \", maybe Asian ...whatever it is, DON'T GO! I promise you'll be disappointed just like we were! I knew something was off when I'm in a \"Mexican restaurant \" & the music that's playing is classic rock ! Where's the ambiance of being in a Mexican restaurant ? I thought I was at PT's pub for a minute .... What a joke this place is!!!!!\nThey don't even deserve the 1 star I gave them, cause the whole place had an attitude! That place won't make it...you watch! They took over Embers space in Boca Park by the Cheesecake Factory . What a waste of $30 that was...I only wish I would have taken a pic of the food so I could have posted it here so you could see for yourselves that everything I've said is true! Neither one of us could finish  our meals, & it wasn't because we got full...because it was all we could do to eat 1/2 of it, that's how  bad it was! We both had 1/2 our meal still on our plates when we left....we just wanted to get out of there !\nThat was our 1st time there & our last"

I was lucky enough to come here prior to them opening to the public to sample and critique the Cantina. I loved it! we have been here a minimum of 10 times since then. Back to Friday Night and the 2 star rating! \nWe get there at 9:00 pm, order our food, sit down outside, in a few minutes we get our food served by the gentleman from the kitchen. the waitress that was helping the other patrons outside literally blew us off completely.\nThere are 2 other tables being occupied, the manager comes outside and greets the couple next to us and asks how their evening is and if everything is alright, they chat for about a minute. He then proceeds to pass our table and goes to the next table and asks them the same questions, they chat a little longer, wait.. here comes the big issue.. the manager looks at me and my group with a look of disgust, turns and walks back inside! WTF!! seriously?! \nWe paid for our food like everyone else in this place, why not ask us, how our food is? I did not want to make a big deal because I don't want the girls to feel uncomfortable, but the manager continues to stare at us from inside, but never came out again. \nMy husband had to go to the front counter to ask for a to-go box and to refill our drinks. This is the first time I have ever felt so little in my life! Need less to say we did not leave a tip and i felt horrible, but like my husband said, since we were invisible to the waitress, she got an invisible tip too! She did nothing for us, not one word to us for the hour we were there. \nI hate to tell my daughter that we will not be going back, because, us being Mexican, we think the food is actually delicious. I dont fel comfortable returning. I was really hoping that is was not a racial issue (we are a biracial family) because this is the first time i had seen that certain manager and we were treated like crap.. but after reading some of the other reviews, they pick and choose who gets good service :( \nI will not recommend this place to anyone again. Good food, horrible service by those 2 who worked on 11/6/15."

The enchiladas were yummy as well as the margaritas. I didn't care too much for the corn on the cob; it was different than expected. Overall this place rates as average. I'm not too impressed but I would go back if I was thirsty for a margarita in Boca Park."

We asked if the habanero guacamole was really spicy or just had a hint of the flavor and the employee said it wasn't spicy at all. So for $6.00 we got it and the portion was ridiculously small. Robertos gives more food than that and actually would have rather gone there . The portions were way smaller than expected especially bc the heavier set girl said they were big enough to share. WRONG."
