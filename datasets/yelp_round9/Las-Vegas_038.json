            "review": "This place is awesoooooooooooome!!!! \nCool vibe, nice interior, lovely outdoor patio. Came here on a Wednesday night with some girls, and a DJ was playing some awesome 90's hip hop, alternating with some karaoke action. \n\nBacon and cheddar tater tots- 4/5. Everyone loved it but I thought it was good. \nSummer succotash- 4/5. Good stuff but not to die for. First time eating succotash and apparently it doesn't get any better than this. \nDeviled eggs-3/5. Good but nothing special. \nTruffle fries- 4/5 Good but I've had better. \nMezza plate- 3/5.  The waiter recommended this. I didn't think the hummus and anything else was that great except for the fried garbanzo bean that was crunchy on the outside. \nShrimp and grits- 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! Great sauce flavor, shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the grits patty that looks like a hash brown was absolutely delicious. I'd come back for this dish hands down. \n\nPhenomenal selection of beers available here. One extra star for carrying my fave beer...Greenflash IPA. \nService was excellent. It's slow because it was busy, but our waiter Jared was super helpful, friendly, and made sure we were taken care of though keep in mind service is generally slow and our food took a while to arrive. \n\nKyle, the GM came by to say hello and he was super nice as well. \nI like the ambiance of this place, and the DJ who played awesome music really made the night for me. Met a lot of cool locals. I'd definitely come back to try the jidori fried chicken as well as their burgers. Kudos to Jared for putting up with us ladies on our girls night out! ;)"

            "review": "This is one of the worst places I have been to in a long time.  Food was not cooked properly and very poor service.  We had several people in our party and two ordered hamburgers.  One well, the other med. well.  Both came out red inside, basically rare to medium rare.  I sent mine back after the server said it would only take 3 minutes to fix it.  12 minute later mine comes back after everyone else is done with their meal. You've all had that happen where it really disrupts the vib.  When it finally showed up, the side salad was wilted and warm, like it had been sitting under a heat lamp or in the microwave.  I sent it back and let them keep it and ate what was left of my wife's salad (which had way too much dressing on it).  The other person at his rare burger and got sick later so maybe I should feel lucky.  \n\nI spoke to the manager but it was some young guy and he just smiled while I was talking as if he thought it was funny.  I even asked him why he was smiling and he said \"I am just a happy guy\" so at the end of the day, they don't even care.  They are a new place now and crowded, but if they don't learn how to cook or fix an incorrect order 702 will be seeing fewer and fewer people drop by.  Beware."

Very few options.\nI had the shrimp and grits, the bacon was not cooked all the way plust floating in a bowl of gris! Disgusted! disappointed. Definitely not worth the money I paid... I will never go back and I will definitely tell my family and friends and all people I know not to go to public school."

That being said if I/we lived closer this could become an issue~ and my server has been Sherrie (just a coincidence) and she is polite, knows the menu, checks back in after your food arrives ~ She just knows her job functions which as basic as it sounds, many in her perfection DO NOT ~\n   I can't imagine coming here & not ordering the Buffalo Cauliflower or Speck & Eggs~ I would feel cheated as these 2 items are consistent, DEEELISH not to mention remarkable!!!!\n    Today I ordered the Grilled Watermelon & Tomato stack  with feta cheese, mint & basalmic glaze~ Beautifully presented (I posted a pic) and very delicious to my tastes. I am NOT a feta  however this feta was SOOO thinly sliced it complemented the watermelon perfectly & the addition of some nuts on the plate as a garnish supplied that needed crunch that would have been missing~\n    This is a casual spot with seating in & outdoors both are lovely ~ However I will warn you it is loud so IF your looking for quiet, this is NOT a good choice especially after 5 when the bar is filling up. Conversation at our table for lunch was fine as it was sparsely full."

I poured a whole bottle of wine, and every single glass of water, and waited and waited and waited. Short staffed? Probably, but that's not really the proper solution to deal with what I delt with over 2 hours. But Ill cut them a break because the food is always amazing hahaha! You have to stop by here and have the Chorizo mac and cheese is out of this world!"

Only issue was that management could not find a table for party of 10 for happy hour so that was disappointing. Jared made it fun and made some ok jokes but it was funny after a few drinks! I will def come back here with co workers after a Friday nigh. I wish they had ranch dressing but it was a great experience after a hard week of work. Wish I had more $$ to leave a better tip. Thank you Jared for making my first encounter with PS702 a great one. We will def come back here again. P.S. Kudos for the chef."

            "review": "Made a reservation here for lunch as I was advised to by two different people.  This was the best advice as when I arrived a group in front of me had to wait. I didn't. :) Upon looking at their menu online I was worried as it didn't show prices. To me, this usually means it's going to be expensive. \n\nThe menus took me back to my school days as their brunch menu was a test scantron and the regular menu was a composition book. Being as it was lunch and I wasn't feeling breakfast so much I went with the Bison BBQ burger. At the beginning the servers were attentive, but closer to the end of my meal, they stopped coming by as much and I waited a while for the bill.\n\nMy burger was tasty.  However, I didn't taste any BBQ sauce which I was rather disappointed with. The cheese ratio was astounding! Usually I feel restaurants skimp on the cheese, but here it covered the whole burger. It also came with a side of fries and sriracha ketchup.  The fries were ok, and although I can't eat spicy the ketchup was addicting! \n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant was nice. They played reggae tunes which made me feel like I was at home in Hawaii.  The decor was eccelectic and kept my eyes wandering. \n\nI had a great experience here and would love to come back to try other foods and their beers.  I hear they have a great happy hour."

The waitress said that they didn't expect too be that crowded today. It was not a problem because they take your cell # & text you when your table I s ready...so we walked around the Art Festival & Farmers Market. It was worth the wait! Both our meals were delicious! I just wish I had room for the Nutella Ice Cream Sandwich :)"

I was a little disappointed to see that their menu was not more expansive but still found great items to eat.\n\nTheir menu seems to me to be more about their beer and drinks. The ambiance is great and would be an awesome place to hang out, eat, and drink with friends without having to go to the club. \n\nWe sat on the patio area of the restaurant and it was beautiful. The conversation was good, so we didn't realize that our food hadn't come out for an hour. Our waitress was very attentive and was actually the one that brought it up to attention. They came back up to us to apologize and bought another round of drinks for us. Awesome save Public School 702."

            "review": "Mini Yelp gathering with some of my favorite yelpers in Vegas. Most of us was the first time dining at Public School 702. Including me never been but for the most part only heard great reviews! It one of many restaurant in Downtown Summerlin. Off topic say love love the fact Downtown Summerlin finally filling out all of the retail and restaurant spaces. I still remember first open walking around like is anything open. \n\nBack task at hand. So we had big party so got to see decent amount of food off the menu. No reason but good one for us. The kitchen cooked up extra appetizers so found home at our table. I got try the devil eggs, and bacon cheddar tots. Not sure if extra or someone on the table ordered it but Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. The presentation not only for all \"For The Table\" or appetizers thought was well done. I like the incorporation of cutting boards. To the little cast iron servers for both the Tots and Cauliflower. I think both of them use the same breading cause looking the same. It nice golden brown outside, hot on inside, and fried goodness. The tots admit enjoyed the best out of the three. I enjoy the combination of bites of bacon and the cheddar all combine in one bite. The other two never ok but nothing special. The eggs really liked the presentation the most out of the three. \n\nMy entree went with the Fried JIdori Chickem & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles. It been while since had Fried Chicken and Waffles. The last time was down south in Atlanta, GA. it was pretty darn good. Public School 702 took Fried Chicken and Waffles another level. The fried chicken not your normal wing and thigh pieces. I enjoy mixed it up then traditional. They incorporated chicken tender meat with the breast. Still have the wing/drumstick. One of the things that stood out for me once got the dish. The hot sauce had on top of the chicken but not completely soaked in it. The batter they use fan of BIG TIME. I love the crispy crust. It has ton of flavor and the meat inside on all the pieces was cooked perfection. The waffles adding green chili not just plain waffles. Yay! f could would order each one separate just double the amount. When put both together then throw some of the bacon sauce or whatever in side dish. Unreal delicious. Memorable. Hearty. No doubt heart attack. Once in while want indulge heavy not good for your health dish. This is the way to go. \n\nI wanted to try the sirachi ketchup/ mustard sauce with the brown bag of fries. The fries are just that fries. The sauces are devine. The honey mustard sauce that could use for spread on ANY sandwich. The sirachi one of my stable condiments and fan of. It was tasty. If want take fries another level make sure use both the sauces. \n\nEveryone else dishes on the table looking good. I got try the Truffle Mac and Cheese. I like it!!!! It had nice balance between the truffle and cheese. It came with the steak dish I believe. I know your can order for side. \n\nThe staff is awesome. Our server she was amaZing. There was nine of us she on top of it. Explained everything for the first timers like myself. Made great suggestions on the menu. Friendly. I know lot of times big parties restaurant reluctant split checks. She said not problem at all. Think two or three appetizers lucked out got for free. Thank you Public School 702. I will be attending class again sooner then later............Good stuff!!!!"

We enjoyed the buffalo cauliflower and my Moscow mule was fine, however both of our salads - the steak and the ahi - were skimpy for the price.

From the service, theme, food, drinks and culture this is a must visit. \n\nWe arrived and were told it was going to be about 30 min but were sat in about 15. The hostess was friendly and even though she was talking to someone she was able to still look at us, smile and let us know she would be with us in a minute. Simple acknowledgement goes a very long way!\n\nThe menus were like black notebooks which immediately caught my eye and the beer list was typed on notebook paper. Very original.\n\nStarted with a vanilla, blueberry canned beer called the big blue van and surprisingly it was really good! They specialize in a lot of crafted beers so if you like beer I recommend this spot. Next we had the tuna nicoise salad and then the short ribs. The food was prompt and very good. \n\nService was 5 stars. Even though we had one server many others touched out table to make sure we were ok or to check if we needed anything. I will be back for sure!\n\nSide note: cool spot for group gatherings that have a oudoor patio area with its own bar AND.... A beer pong table!!! Lol"

Food: we got the fig and prosciutto pizza, expected figs, guessing it was fig sauce. Arugula was overkill overtook the prosciutto. Chopped salad: needs contrast. It was all fatty texture and crunch. I'm saying it.. Bland. Charcuterie plate: it was all bread. 2 meats 5 slices each. Deviled eggs: nothing new, just add very crispy bacon stabbed on top. The only redeeming thing I would go back to is my drink: Player's cut. Just add more luxardo cherries."

Once I make it past, and to the bar/pickup, I can see my food sitting on the cold counter. I was rather upset.\n\nThe bartender was very nice, greeted me in under a minute, attended to my order immediately, and with a smile. Did my best to be nice back, but couldn't shake the agitation of my food sitting out. I falsely assumed it would remain under a heat lamp until pick-up. My guess is it sat for 5-10m, as it was luke-warm once I got to my car. \n\nOverall, I'll give this place one more try, maybe...

Sadly, this place was beyond disappointing, but considering they are still working on getting the kinks out, we may be back.\n\nPositives:\n\n1) great setting, fun ambiance, great outdoor space with games, and fairly large space to get seated quickly.\n\n2) Variety of interesting food and drink selections on the menu at a good price; good happy hour offerings\n\n3) The ahi tacos and calamari were great. The blueberry lavender drink was tasty, but did not come with the sprig of lavender as pictured. Think it needed more lavender.\n\nNegatives:\n\n1) I ordered the ahi tuna tacos on the appetizer menu and asked that the tacos and slaw salad I ordered on the side come out together as my entree. The taco came out first, even before the appetizer we ordered and my salad came way later.\n\n2) My husband ordered a burger medium. It came out literally raw! It could have made him sick. They made him a new one and took it off our check.\n\n3) We ordered the Nutella Ice Cream sandwich after reading all the great reviews. There was WAX PAPER in our cookie which was used to put the ice cream on the sandwich. Additionally, the cookie was extremely hard and inedible. \n\n4) A manager came to talk to us only after the food critic seated next to us told him what a bad experience we had. My only problem with this is that the server did not tell the manager to come talk to us after we received poor quality food. We talked to the manager who did not seem very apologetic but did give us his card if we wanted to come back. They should have comped us our meal based on our experience, but alas no offers. \n\nI am understanding that the restaurant is new. Unlike Lazy Dog which is around the corner and trained their staff for two weeks prior to opening, Public School 702 seems to be lacking in food and service. I am hoping this will be worked out in the future. As I stated above, its a great spot and a shame if things don't pick up. It can only go up from here!"

I don't think I'll go again, but I wouldn't be opposed to going again. I took my ex wife and 20 year old son there. It was $65 for the 3 of us.

I ended up trying the ahi sandwich, which was pretty yummy - the french fries, though, were perfection.  Our server, Brittany Craig, was super nice and attentive. Thank you for a beautiful Sunday morning!"

There was a little bit of a wait if you wanted an actual table but it wasn't long and it was a Saturday night so what else can you expect. Our waiter was great. He was very helpful with suggestions of food and beer. He also let us know about the specials they offer throughout the week. We ordered the kale Caesar salad, bangers and mash, and bison burger. Everything was fantastic! My fianc\u00e9 enjoyed his beers as well. The service was also very quick but we didn't feel rushed or anything.    We also loved the atmosphere and the decor. We would definitely come back here. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu."

The layout of the restaurant is great, with imagery bringing you back to school days and a clear view through the kitchen where you can see the chefs create tasty dishes. The beer choices are on point and the staff is knowledgeable and will help with any questions you have (from seasonal favorites to what will pair well with certain dishes). The food is what really drove me write this review. Speck and Eggs were phenomenal, Roasted Chicken and Quinoa Salad exceptional, Schoolyard Dog outstanding... but the best thing there has to be the Irish Stout Short Ribs, mouthwatering and extremely flavorful!! Make sure you save some room for dessert, the Chef's special dessert (chocolate chip cookie with nutella, vanilla ice cream and fried prosciutto/bacon with nilla wafers) brought the whole meal together. Left completely full, happy and satisfied. Will definitely be coming back!"

The decor had a blast from the past vibe fused with a school vibe. The pair of metal strap on roller skates really brought back some memories. Came in on a Saturday at eleven a.m. and the place had about twenty people.  An hour later and the place was packed. On to the food. Started with the spicy calamari. The calamari was cooked perfectly. However, because of the bay seasoning, the amount of salt was overpowering. Ordered the Huntsman burger with extra bacon. Loved the flavor of the balsamic caramelized onions. The downside is that my burger sat in the burger juice and the bottom bun got soggy. The fries were over cooked, but I enjoyed the crunch. Ended lunch with a Nutella chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich. Very sweet and is a huge portion. I could only eat half, but enjoyed this dessert. Ambience and service was on point. Food was not so great. I will give this place a second try to make sure that it wasn't just what I ordered. I really like the selection of beers and that they served Tenaya Creek beer. One of the best beers in Vegas. I imagine that this would be a great place to have a reunion or to just party."

We came across Public School 702 and felt that it would fit the bill. \nAmbience: this is one huge restaurant. When you walk in, on the right is a fairly good-size bar. To the left has to be one of the biggest restaurants I've seen in a very long time. The noise level is quite High. If you find that kind of buzz to be high-energy and invigorating, eating indoors would be right for you. I don't. Fortunately it was a lovely night and we chose to eat on the patio. The patio is also huge. And it is very nicely laid out with many booths and several couches.\nService: our server, Brandon, was at our table almost immediately after we sat down. A winning smile and a really Pleasant  attitude . Made us feel very comfortable immediately . We got there just two to three minutes before happy hour ended. He was able to rush our order in so that we made it under the wire. He also made a couple of recommendations. Overall, very high points for service.\nFood: we started the meal with white bean hummus. A small appetizer size portion on the happy hour menu for just $4. Absolutely delicious and just the right size to start the meal. My wife ordered the happy hour sliders. 3 small hamburgers cooked to perfection. She found them to be delicious. I had the Margarita Pizza. This was just ok.\nValue: outstanding Ambience on the patio ( would not have wanted to eat indoors due to the noise level) and excellent service with satisfying food at happy hour prices. Very good value - dinner for two for about 25 bucks"

Waiter was Matt and he was very Attentive.\nI got the Eggs Benedict Pizza, really good prosciutto and the crust was buttery and hot when it came out.\n\nGrandma got the chicken and waffles, tried it as well was really good especially with their take on waffles which was made out of corn bread. Love corn bread and the fact it was eagle texture but still filling and hardy? Perfect. Gravy was chunky but still flavorful. Overall all the flavored balanced well.\n\nUncle got Lamb Burger, looked good and he enjoyed it but said it needed the creamy horseradish he loves and once he got it A1 as well.\n\nCame for brunch and they also have bottomless options. \n\n5 stars in my eyes because of one key thing. Went to the bathroom and my family had walked out and I thought they'd grab my left over pizza.. Was about half.. They didn't so I walked back to the table - no more than 3 minutes later- pizza had been tossed. Didn't even insist and Matt out of his way to stop what's he's doing speak with his manager and quickly inform me if I am in no rush if I could wait 5-10 for a new one to cook for me to take home. I mean I wasn't and was gonna walk around anyways so I opted to wait around and was expecting maybe half of a smaller version of one. But they gave me an entire pizza.. This one even seemed larger than my original one! Don't know the managers name, Caucasian man maybe 6'3 .. Thank you nd hats off to this place!\n\nAwesome decor; color schemes matched & you can tell the place was good simply by the fact that they were slammed.. I'm not the only one who thinks it too.\n\n100% recommend and I will be back to try some of those crazy percentage drafts"

This is why I'm giving a 1 star. I would of gave this place a higher review but we had told the hostess in the front it's our mothers birthday and we wanted to do lil something for her. She said they can do a cake and candle and she will let our server know. \nSo here we are waiting and waiting for the cake. The server comes grabs our check and here we are anticipating for the cake to surprise my mom. So 15 min later I'm like damn does it really take that long to give back my card. So I'm thinking maybe they're going to give the cake when she returns with our card. But noooo our server comes back and gives us back our card and tells us have a nice day. So we left. \nSo upset!! We really wanted to surprise my mom. Never again coming back here. \n\nNot trained employees who don't give a crap."

I didn't really know he worked there, but he ended up seating us. We were presented a drink and food menu. Their selection of beers weren't vast, but with what they had, they seemed real delicious. I personally got a Nitro beer and ordered the crispy buffalo cauliflower and speck & eggs as appetizers. As entrees, my friend and I ordered a shorty bowl and a moody burger. \n\nThe appetizers came out first. The crispy buffalo cauliflower came out in a good amount, and was indeed crispy. They had a little bit of cheese between the breading and cauliflower. The speck & eggs, although good, only had 4 halves bought out to us. When the entrees came out, I was really excited for the burger that came with a quinoa salad and the shorty bowl. The burger was really juicy and I couldn't get enough of it. The shorty bowl had some real delicious potatoes on the bottom of the bowl with the short ribs and other add-ins. \n\nOur service was up to par. Our waitress checked up on us periodically, which was greatly appreciated. The food was good overall, but just a bit pricey. With all 6 of our items, it was near $80. Although good, I would rather not spend that much on two people regularly."

Everything was great. The Mary's are SPICY, so if that isn't your thing- be forewarned - I believe the spicier the better. It comes topped with a chicken wing (would have preferred bacon and olives or something else).\nMy husband ordered the adobo tacos with rice and I ordered the CCB with brown bag fries and sriracha ketchup. The first burger came out slightly raw. When I let the server know she was so wonderful and the manager came over and let us know how sorry he was. They sent out a new one and it was better than I expected. The sriracha ketchup had just the right amount of kick- I really liked it.\nEven though we were stuffed, we saw a Lemon Meringue pass by and I couldn't help but order. I'm so glad I did.

We joined another couple for Happy Hour at 4:00pm & were seated at a very large booth in the bar area the moment we arrived which was great because it was pretty busy & continued to fill up to capacity. \nLauren was our server & was at our table the minute the hostess left, she asked if we wanted to order drinks/water which was appreciated since the other half of our party was running late & we were ready for some refreshments. Cold water arrived immediately, drinks followed within minutes which was a surprise since, again, it was pretty busy!\nAs soon as the rest of our party arrived Lauren was back to take their order, within a minute or two. She took care to answer the boys questions about the large variety of beers & made some helpful suggestions, she mentioned that she was a bartender as well, so she was really informed on the bar offerings. She returned less than 10 minutes later with the additional drinks then answered questions about the menu, again offered a few suggestions. We selected the Farro Salad & Dip Duo, both arrived within five minutes, both had great flavors and nice presentation! Lauren did not hover, but did check in to see how we were doing, we sent her away with more drink and food orders...round two! We ordered 2 orders of Crispy Ahi Tacos, Crispy Cauliflower, Wild Mushroom Pizza and another order of Farro Salad (it was THAT good!). Again, everything came out very quickly & was perfect, each item was a very good size and did well to fill us up! We even ended up with a free order of Speck & Eggs due to the fact that one of the other servers mixed up her tables & had an extra, they were tasty as well!\nLauren checked in on us a few more times & made sure that we had everything we needed, all in all we were there over three hours and she never made us feel that we were holding up a table, she was a perfect server & we will ask to sit in her section the next time we come. \nWe enjoyed the atmosphere and the cool design/decor and will definitely go back, can't wait for cooler weather to enjoy the patio!!!"

The Siracha ketchup with the tots is amazing but again I enjoy spicy. **PERFECT BITE ALERT** Cauliflower with the blue cheese aoli and hot sauce on top #yummy. I also tried a bit of friends Watermelon and Tomato Salad AMAZING!\n\n For an entree I ordered the Flat Iron steak with Chorizo Mac n Cheese. The steak was really good and you could cut it with a butter knife. The Mac N Cheese was not good at all but I am a Mac N Cheese snob. It just lacked flavor to me...a dash of salt and pepper would have been great.\n\n Service is really hit or miss. It took some time to get drinks as they had one bartender making drinks for the entire patio. Our server was cool my only issue was he seemed to linger and talk a little much for me. He was so busy telling his life story we had a hard time asking for more water or placing an order. His other tables were a little frustrated as well and he was very over dramatic. \n\nOverall I would give this place another try but it hasn't made my favorites list yet."

After hearing very good things about Public School 702 from others, my wife and I went to this new addition to Downtown Summerlin for the first time last night, and brought friends along from out of town.  It was definitely worth the time it took to drive downtown to get them, then drive back to Summerlin for this dining experience.\n\nWith it's school themed decor, the atmosphere is unique enough that the interior doesn't look like just another gastrobup and bar.  The vide was happy across the entire restaurant, with everyone looking like they'd waited all week to finally be there.  I'm not sure why, but it was noticeable and different than many other comparable places.  The waitstaff kept active all the time.  I never saw anyone stop, and although we had a dedicated waiter, several others would quickly swing by the table to take empty plates away, bring more water, etc.\n\nOnto the food:  delicious!  I had the Grilled Salmon with Summer Succotash, my wife and one of our friends had The Huntsman burger, and our other had the Shrimp and Grafton Cheddar Grits.  The food was hot and perfectly prepared.  Everything looked fantastic when they brought it out.  The succotash with my salmon was the best I've had anywhere.  Tell you what:  this was definitely not \"public school\" cafeteria food.  I'll definitely go back and try many of the other dishes on the menu.\n\nBeer:  lots of craft beer choices with a standing list in the menu, plus another sheet at the table of beers they're temporarily featuring.  Of note, they had at least one \"sour\" beer on the menu.  I'd only recently heard of this kind of beer and was pleased to see sour options available in a place that features craft beer as a part of the dining experience.  You really need to take a look at the menu to see all your standing beer choices.\n\nDefinitely make a reservation when you go.  We had a seat near the window and could see a line forming at the door periodically as people waited for a tables to open.  You can make a reservation right from the restaurant's website or through Yelp (worked great!).  To the restaurant's credit, the hostesses seemed to work through the line very quickly every time it built up, although I couldn't tell if folks were queuing up waiting for any table, or for a table they reserved.\n\nWe sat inside, but noticed there's ample outdoor patio seating overlooking the more scenic part of Downtown Summerlin.  The option to sit outside is always a plus!\n\nTake note, it's loud inside.  Not ridiculously loud, but the larger size of the dining area tied to a lack of decor that would help muffle or absorb sound fosters a fairly loud environment.  Even so, it wasn't a detractor.  Even though this is definitely not a public school's cafeteria, the volume may remind you of those days when you and your friends we're carrying on conversations in the buzzing school cafeteria.  Again, not a problem; just know it going in.  This isn't the place for a quiet, intimate date.\n\nOne small misstep I chalk up to a restaurant still finding their stride: no salt and pepper on the table, but it was quickly remedied when we pointed it out.  We'll definitely go again.  And again.  If I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars right now, and assuming Public School 702 hits its stride they way I think it will, don't be surprised to see me update my review to a five stars after another visit or two."

We had the mac & cheese for an appetizer & then for entrees we had chicken and waffles and the Huntsman burger.  The chicken had fantastic flavor and the cornmeal waffle was awesome!  The Huntsman burger was underdone and the char on the outside had nothing to balance it out like strong cheese or sauce so it was a bit off-putting.  I probably wouldn't order it again. \n\nFor dessert we had the brownie & the nutella cookie sandwich.  The nutella cookie sandwich was twice the size of my burger and the pecan brittle was amazing!  I really didn't taste the nutella due to the other flavors but I would definitely get this again (and share it with 3 other people).  The brownie was less brownie and more fudge - it was very dense and the top of the brownie seemed to have dark chocolate icing.  Not being a fan of dark chocolate I wasn't a fan but my husband liked it.  \n\nOverall, we would definitely come back... and I might just order the mac & cheese as my entree!"

As you walk through the dining area, you come upon these giant globes hanging from the ceiling, which reminded me just of the solar system in my school library. We were seated at a table with chairs, but there are also booths and bar seating. The chairs are a cute small scale black metal chair, of course following the school motif, but are not at all comfortable. It's very noisy in here, but it didn't affect our conversation too much. The menu is very different, but some safe choices too. Bangers and mash, fish and chips, pizza, etc. I ordered the Mac and cheese app as my meal accompanied with a cup of tortilla soup. The soup was forgotten and I had to ask for it, not a big deal..it wasn't too spicy, just the right amount. The Mac had chorizo in it, which I found way too salty. My friend had fish and chips. She said it was good, but the fries were even better! As an appetizer, we opted for the calamari. It came with a ginger aioli that was delish. The calamari was heavily breaded, but ok. I'd like to go back when it's a bit warmer as they have outdoor seating looking down on the courtyard. We asked for a to-go box and also received a brown paper bag labeled 'homework', so cute!"

Our server was very kind. She seemed like she was running around in the beginning, she got to our table and was out of breath. I just wanted to tell her to take it easy lol. We ordered a Bloody Mary half way through our meal and although it was garnished with a chicken wing we couldn't finish it because it was too spicy, salty, etc. I would say try to make the drink like more of a drink than a spicy sauce for a hickey wing. It was just too spicy to the point that we only sipped maybe 25% of the drink (4 of us were sipping on it). But now onto the good stuff! The food was amazing. We had the calamari and chorizo Mac and cheese for an appetizer, I didn't get a picture when it first came out due to the fact that I was excited and hungry. The calamari was delicious and a good size as an appetizer for 5 people. The chorizo Mac and cheese was \"the shit\"! Never tasted any Mac and cheese quite like this one, they even come with potato chips on top to give 'em a little crunch. Next up was my entree, I had the fish and chips and to say the least it was good. It didn't have the right flavor I was looking for but mind you, it was my first time EVER ordering fish and chips, so for those of you who like fish and chips and love tartar sauce, this is the place you that you should go to. Next came dessert, and since we waited a while to get our food they gave us a complimentary dessert which were the Nutella chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich and the lemon merengue. The desserts were outstanding! Just keep in mind lemon merengue packs a little punch but it was delicious. I rated this place 4 stars because the food is awesome, and even though the kitchen was slow management actually showed that they cared about our dining experience. There are a few things that need to be fixed like the little particles in the water, maybe tone all the spices down in the Bloody Mary as well. But other than that I have no complaints because the food was absolutely delicious, and that's what I went there for right?! Definitely a spot to check out, it's on the second floor so it had a pretty cool view."

Did not write down our order (which is fine if you are a good server, but not okay if you can't remember the order.) She took another 10 minutes to actually input our order into the POS. I know this since our table was next to the POS and she had to confirm with me how I wanted my burger as she entered it in to the system. The delayed effort resulted in her forgetting all about ordering our appetizer. \n\nI have worked in a restaurant before and understand when it gets busy, and when mistakes happen etc .. but then Jessica had the audacity to lie about forgetting the appetizer and instead blamed the person who ran the food taking the app to the wrong table, then later blamed the kitchen for the problem. Said the \"kitchen\" was having a bad day. More like SHE was having a bad day. It would have been much better to just admit to making the mistake, then apologize and comp the appetizer.  \n\nThe two stars are because of the manager who came by to check on us and apologize for the error. She seemed genuinely apologetic and kind. \n\nJessica meanwhile, dropped off our check, and then disappeared. We asked her for a box to take the leftovers home, but she never came back. Had to flag down another person for the box! Guess Jessica figured she wasn't getting a tip so we no longer mattered to her! Customer service at it's best at Public School 702!"

It is a huge restaurant and has a very large outdoor area with booths and even ceiling fans as well as beer pong, it appeared. I didn't go outside because it is an oven here in Vegas. I was shocked that people sit outside and eat, there were like 5 tables of people when I went sitting outside. Go for it, if that is your thing. \n\nWe sat in the bar area which I felt was pretty spacious but it filled up quick. My friends arrived at 3:30 when it first started and said a couple tables were available. When I arrived around 4, the place was filling up quick. I think we left around 5:30 and I saw a wait, about 6-10 people outside. If possible, I suggest coming early to reserve a spot for happy hour \"recess.\" This restaurant is really cute on the details without going overboard on the school theme, but if you look close you will see flashcards above the bar and all kinds of little fun cool details everywhere. I am a teacher, so I don't need to be reminded of school please, but for me the decorations were cool not annoying or cheesy. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nCrispy Cauliflower-served with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese  sooo good!\n\nFarro and Brussel Sprouts Salad-delicious!!\n\nDip Duo- not so great, The bread was not crispy nor soft, it seemed old and had a strange feeling to it, dips were just ok, nothing special \n\nSpeck & Eggs- I enjoyed this. It was salty but good. \n\nCrispy Naked Wings- I am not a big fan of wings, but these were really good. \n\nCrispy Ahi Tuna Tacos-I enjoyed these too!\n\nParmesan Truffle Fries- I have to say I have been unable to find a place that does truffle fries just how I want it. To me, these were just right! Loved the lemon aioli dipping sauce on the side\n\nMy hubby had beers and he did not complain. I wish they had some girly cocktails on their happy hour menu, not just well drinks. That is kind of boring. \n\nService was good, plenty of workers everywhere, and I am happy we have a new good restaurant to go to, especially with such a good happy hour."

I remembered all of the reviews mentioning the crispy cauliflower and I decided that I had to try it. I came for HH and was seated at the bar. Although alone, the bartender was pleasant and was chatty without being intrusive. I liked that. I had the HH portion of the cauliflower ($5) and the tuna tacos($7.) I also had an incredible beer, 2 Stone 's \"Sorry Not Sorry\" that was suggested by the bartender. Honestly, I'm not a drinker, as Yelpers at events can attest to, but this beer was fantastic (as it should be for $8.) \n\nThe second time I went, a few days later, I again had to have the crispy cauliflower. The regular portion is much larger than the HH size, so the price is fair. Brian P. and I also ordered the mashed potatoes (just as a snack, not a full meal) and the potatoes were taking a really long time to come out to us. When we mentioned to our waitress that we still hadn't received the potatoes, she went to check for us in the kitchen. The kitchen told her that they were already aware that we hadn't received our potatoes, as they had made them already but they weren't up to par. Because of this snafu, the cook was remaking our order and without us even asking, she told us that we wouldn't be billed for the potatoes. That's good customer service. Thankfully, the potatoes were piping hot and delicious. \n\nWhile my only gripe is that the entrees are pretty pricey for a casual bar type place, in general, I really enjoyed PBS. I love the theme, the food and the service. I will be back!"

I splurged on them with a friend before my main dish of bangers and mash. The bangers and mash is good, too, but not as good as some of their other items I've had.\n\nMy last visit I ate the shrimp and grits and it was BETTER than shrimp and grits I've had in Charleston, SC. AH-MAY-ZING. I ate and ate and ate until I was about to burst, because I just couldn't get enough. The grits come in this fried patty form, but the minute you take a fork to it, it crumbles into succulent grits with a bit of a crunch on the outside. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the sauce that they pour over it all is so good I'd eat it as a soup by itself!\n\nWe've had the meat and cheese platter, and the fish and chips too. \nEverything is delicious.\n\nThe only downside is that when the weather is too cold to enjoy sitting outside, the inside is NOISY.

I found our table easily. \n        The patio was nice, I joined our group and after... A while, our server got my drink order. Eventually my drink came out. It was delightful, I think it was called a crushed velvet, it was refreshing and tasty and wonderful, served in a sweaty copper mug with lavender and blackberries it made me smile. I didn't meet the bar tender, but I know we would be the best of friends. Now I was ready for some food, it was happy hour so I chose their PB&J sliders. Tiny burgers with peanut butter and jelly and BACON?! Yes please. I waved down a server (not ours because I hadn't seen her in... Forever) and asked her if I could order something to eat. She hunted down our girl and she took my order. The sliders came out in a timely manner, and they were delightful. The bacon was thick and cooked to perfection, and just the right amount of peanut butter and jelly really made these juicy burger babies pop. It was close to time for me to head downstairs to see a movie so I put on my best \"check please\" face and looked around for our server who was once again gone forever. I flagged down another server and asked if I could get my check as the rest of the party was staying but I needed to head out, she found our server (from the abyss, I assume) and she brought me the check. As she handed it to me I said \"can you hang on one sec, I'll get you my card right now.\" And when I turned back around with my card and the bill, she was again gone. As it was now three minutes till I needed to be downstairs I went in and asked someone to run my check or find my girl. Which they did and I speed walked to the movie and was alright. \n           Even though our server was incredibly distracted and the other servers brought other tables food and drink to our table multiple times, and I heard everyone's tales of how this is the standard for their service, I'll still try it again. The food and drinks were awesome, the service just wasn't there. It wasn't the end of the world, but it almost made me late to see magic mike."

Tonight's dinner took 3 hours for 2 people to have apps, entree and share a dessert!!! Why does it always take so long for a serve to acknowledge a table once seated? And it usually just spirals from there. This night it was a missing appetizer that I had remind the server about. It finally showed up at the end of the meal. If it wasn't for the awesome pizza and BUFFALO CAULIFLOWER I would never come back. Sometimes a meal is worth sitting thru bad service for."

So I asked Tyler ( shaved head, kinda built, tattoos... just in case theres another Tyler there ) our server, he asked what are my favorite beers. I told him him it was dos equis and blue moon. He said they dont offer mexican beers but they do serve a beer close to blue moon that was called hefenweizen. So thats what I got. I did like the beer and Tyler was great on choosing the suggestion. And he gave great service to us all. Thanks Tyler. I enjoyed my over all visit will visit again. Oh yea... the food was great too. I had the pepperoni pizza."

            "review": "This place is generally good. The only things  I will complain about is that is sort of half upscale sports bar and half casual fine dining sort of weird but it works for them. Also because of the half sports bar atmosphere there are tvs which play sport and loud people screaming at the tvs and it gets extremely obnoxious especially since I'm paying $60-$120 to have a meal there. The pricing is IN NO WAY in line with the atmosphere they have crated. Although the theme is cool, I'll give them that. \n\n I think the food is good but overpriced for sure (probably because it's downtown summerlin) but I'd say definitely worth trying out be prepared for a meal for two to be at least $60 that's the minimum. I had the salmon succotash it was good but it was a bit too lemony for my taste and it said \"grilled\" and I though it was more blackened but maybe my definition for grilled is different. I finished my meal. I paired it with a red wine cabernet which went nicely with the salmon. \n\nMy boyfriend got a huntsman burger which he enjoyed but he said the ketchup it came with was weird and too spicy for his taste (mine too) I tried his burger it tasted good and was seasoned well (not $20worth though)\n\nAll in all its good but no better than like yard house or something and way pricier too."

No hostess at the front table so I just wandered over to the bar area. Sat down and looked over their bar which is loaded with plenty of beers and some interesting alcohol selections as well.\n\nChristina the bartender came over and greeted me with a smile and explained that a few selections were out, and more about their featured beer menu which changes weekly. I chose a nice Citrus-y IPA and looked over the menu for some food.\n\nThis is where they lose some stars because I read the menu several times looking for something that would pique my interest but there really wasn't anything that screamed \"Eat me\". I ended up going with the CCB, or chicken burger. It was decent, with bacon and avocado and cooked well. But it wasn't fantastic out of this world good. \n\nThe two girls next to me were sharing a pizza, and I could see that it was slightly burnt. Didn't look all that impressive. At least the girls were pretty to look at. TV's above the bar seemed out of place and not really a focal point of the bar area. Maybe this place is hopping during Happy Hours. It is a huge space with plenty of tables, and an outdoor patio area that overlooks a nice garden and water feature. \n\nTotal bill was $22 for a beer and a chicken burger, so I probably won't venture back in for a meal but might do some drinking here."

            "review": "From the progressive and adventurous beer list to the exciting twists on comfort food, PS702 won me over within minutes of sitting down.  \n\nAfter sitting in a booth in their spacious bar area, we took several minutes to peruse the menu.  Our server, Katie, was incredibly helpful in steering us to choices for beer and appetizers.  She brought us samples of no less than 6 beers from their draft specials--I can't even remember the last time there were 6 beers on tap that I was interested in.  The decor, an eclectic mix of old school school memorabilia--including obsolete encyclopedias, composition notebook menus, and various sports balls--is whimsical and charming, at once evoking nostalgia and chuckles.\n\nWe couldn't narrow our choices and ended up with three apps: bacon cheddar tots, fiery calamari, and chorizo mac & cheese.  The tots won immediate approval from DH, with him declaring I must get my own order.  Indeed, they were creamy, salty, bombs of delicious, only made better with the just-the-right-amount-of-heat sriracha ketchup.  Mac & cheese had huge chunks of chorizo and a smattering of kale, just enough so you can pretend it's healthy.  The al dente campanelle smothered in an emmental and cheddar sauce really held the sauce and sausage well, even if it was a tad difficult to serve with the undersized spoon provided.  The calamari, dusted with Japanese togorashi pepper blend and served with a light, but potent, ginger aioli wasn't a revelation, but it was a cut above the standard and would be a good choice for a group. Just be sure to ask for extra of the outstanding aioli.  \n\nAfter overindulging on appetizers, we split the lamb burger.  Melted Brie and tomato cranberry jam made just the right complement of tangy, sour, and umami to the perfectly cooked lamb patty.  The burger belied it's simple appearance, rivaling more complicated offerings from other notable Valley restaurants.  The accompanying kale and shaved Brussels sprout slaw wasn't just a throwaway either.  Creamy, bitter, and pungent with red onion and blue cheese, it still qualified as comfort food while providing a much needed veg on the plate.  \n\nDessert was a ginormous version of the ubiquitously trendy ice cream sandwich, but the additions of Nutella and bacon brittle made it too, a standout.\n\nService was excellent too, with food served up quickly from the knowledgeable staff.  Katie in particular went above and beyond for us more than once.  I highly recommend requesting her when you visit.\n\nPS702 is open late with a DJ on the spacious patio on Wednesday, Saturday, and industry night on Monday.  They have more typical hours on the other days.  Our next visit will likely be for their weekend brunch, which features a limited menu of delicious sounding breakfast items like fried jidori chicken & green chili cornbread waffles or eggs Benedict pizza.  The high light though is the \"just about bottomless\" drink menu which includes mimosas, micheladas, bloody Mary's (which I'm told are garnished with a chicken wing) and something called a \"beermosa,\" a must try combo of OJ, wheat beer, cr\u00e8me de peche, and lavender.\n\nThere is nothing I didn't love about PS702, and I plan to be back soon and often."

My dad is a bit of a beer connoisseur so trying new beers along with some good food is right up his alley. The new beers were being launched at 7 so we got there early enough to enjoy happy hour, or \"recess\" as they call it. \nRight off the bat I noticed they had a nice selection of craft beers and our server Jared was extremely knowledgable when my dad expressed his desire to try a new stout. We ordered so many different beers during happy hour and the left coast tasting that I don't remember what we got but everything was delicious! \nNow for the food: We got the speck and eggs which is a deviled egg with prosciutto on it, the mezze plate which consisted of pita bread with hummus and baba ganoush for dipping, crispy buffalo cauliflower with franks hot sauce and bleu cheese for dipping, and sliders. For me the sliders weren't anything special but I enjoyed everything else that we got. My only gripe about the cauliflower is the dipping sauces. This place markets itself as a gastropub so it would have been nice to see a sauce they create themselves.\nOverall this place gets a thumbs up from this girl and I'll definitely be back!"

Too bad the whole experience was pretty subpar. \n\nIn short, our whole 2 hour experience can be summed up as: really really hot outside seating, poor service, and mediocre food :( \n\n--\n\nThe happy hour is only available in the bar area or on half of the outside patio. Considering this is LAS VEGAS, if you're opening up happy hour on the outside patio, I'd hope you could spare some misters or working fans for the area.....or not. I guess we can just sweat it out/ overheat  -___-;;\n\nFine, if you're not providing us any cooling methods, at least make sure we have enough water? Is that too much to ask? Yes, it absolutely is. We had to flag down our waitress multiple times to get water. \n\nNot to mention, our waitress was not so coordinated - would drop items almost onto us. \n\nFinally, the food was really not that great.  Meh, I love the location and the idea, but I don't think we'll be coming back."

There was 6 of us and we sat in an area of the restaurant that wasn't too crowded and had enough elbow room at the table to be comfortable. The service was good, and she was able to accommodate 6 different orders. I had the sausage and grits, which was very interesting because the grits were in a loaf somewhat, and not the country time grits style that I'm used to. It had corn, bacon, sausage, kale, tomatoes, eggs and that loaf that came together nicely. \n\nI changed the egg from fried to scrambled because no matter how hard I try fried egg just doesn't work for my taste buds. Their \"almost bottomless\" is a good deal, you can choose 4 drinks individually, or 4 of the same drinks for $10. The bloody mary came with a chicken wing, which I actually wasn't ready for and slightly confused, but it gave it a nice kick. Overall, this was a great place to meet up with friends, have a couple drinks, and eat good food."

Literally equivalent to eating Little Caesars that someone drenched with 2 lbs of oil. Was gonna complain but our waitress Courtney, but she recommended good wine so I liked her; plus I ate it all because I was dying of starvation. Conclusion: never order the pizza at Public School.

When we got to the restaurant two girls battled over how to Seat us. Once we were seated we waited. We then continued to wait. We waited some more. My wife and I actually played a game where we would see how many waiters or waitresses would either pass by or look at us directly.  After about 10 minutes of just sitting there I told my wife if one more waiter walks by us we would leave. My wife was extremely embarrassed at this, but I had to put my foot down. Shortly after two waiters walked right past us as they talked to each other. We got up to walk out. As we walked out of the restaurant we both laughed. Not only did nobody notice we were leaving, but the greeter who had just seated us actually said thank you have a nice day. I know that this restaurant is fairly new so I won't talk about the food or drink. Oh yeah, we never got to that point. Not sure if we would ever go back to this place. It's just a weird situation to be honest. Doesn't the restaurant want to serve food and drink to its customers? Apparently not for public school (702)."

And the steak with mushroom salad, our mid rare steak was cooked properly but the arugula didn't do the plate justice ( also the portion of greens was off for the price.)"

            "review": "I came  to Public School 702 on a Wednesday night with my cousin. We had just finished watching a movie so we decided to check it out. The restaurant was easy to find and the host at the front was friendly. They have outdoor and indoor seating. We wanted to sit outside but the host informed us that we would have to wait so we opted to sit inside to avoid the wait and check out the restaurant's decor.\n\nBeing a high school teacher, I absolutely adored the restaurant's decor. It was decorated with school memoriabilia including trophies, books, etc. They also had an awesome solar system model hanging from the ceiling and other school themed canvases on the wall.The menus resembled composition notebooks which was a cute touch as well. The restaurant stayed true to its \"public school\" theme.\n\nAs far as the food, we were not super hungry so we decided to order small. We asked the server for recommendations and she was able to give recommendations for each category which was nice. However, being that we do not eat pork, there were limited options of what we could get in the entree section. Almost every dish has bacon in it, so if you love bacon, this is your place! The menu also seems to cater to an older crowd and seemed not so kid friendly. I did not see if there was a kid's menu but I'm assuming they don't have one since most of the people in the restaurant were 21+.\n\nWe ended up ordering the buffalo cauliflower along with the Irish stout braised  ribs. The buffalo cauliflower was actually pretty great. I am not a fan of cauliflower but it was perfectly breaded and tasted just like a buffalo wing. It was served with horseradish and buffalo sauce. I was okay with the buffalo sauce but absolutely hated the horseradish sauce. I figured they would at least have the option of ranch but the server said they did not serve ranch but they could offer aioli which I politely declined. I'm a ranch type of girl so I thought it was weird to have buffalo sauce flavored food without it. Regardless of the ranch though, the buffalo cauliflower is definitely one to try. The Irish stout braised ribs were also delicious. The runner for our food said it was the best entree on the menu and she was right! The meat was boneless and so tender. It paired up perfectly with the mashed potatoes served under it. I would definitely recommend ordering this dish!\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant itself is calm and seems sort of like a lounge. Our server was pleasant but took a while bringing us our check after we had asked for it. She stood by another table talking for almost 5 minutes so it was irritating to wait when we had asked for it before that. Once we got our check, we saw that our meal came out to about $30 for the two dishes, which was not too bad I guess. The only issues I have with this place is not having ranch but also the server giving us our check late. Other than those two issues, the place was nice to try and had tasty food! I'm giving it 3 stars because although it was good and a great place to try, I don't know if I'll come back again by choice."

The pizza was greasy and pretty bland even for ordering 3 different types of pizzas. French fries were good, the hot wing like cauliflower was okay. \n\nThe decor and theme was interesting. Totally forgot about the solar systems we used to do for class. Overall, place is very hipster but it made for a good back up plan but closed too early for being a Friday night.

They offer an impressive tap list without overwhelming you with just \"more\". The Roasted Beet Salad is worth the trip in and of itself with the Crispy Cauliflower and Shrimp-n-Grits a close second. We've really enjoyed everything we've tried. My only knock is the way the combined space echoes and amplifies sound. The dining section is very noisy when they're half-full and it's bordering on mind-numbing when full. Absolutely to be expected (enjoyed!) in the pub section but the carry-over into the dining area is overbearing. You'll thoroughly enjoy your meal / beverage but don't expect to have a memorable conversation over dinner."

You will want to order more than just one order (it's seven in a single order, so if you don't want to end up in a fork war or having that awkward moment when there is only one left...) The steak was incredible. It came out exactly as I ordered it and no steak knife was necessary (which is an amazing accomplishment for the cooks, as flat iron steaks can be very tough.) There was just the right amount of truffle butter on top and just delicious. The mac was also very yummy. So much so that my mum decided she would just eat mine. \n\nNow for dessert! If you are a bacon lover, and who isn't? You need to order the Cookie ice cream sandwich! Right now! It is epic. I mean... Nutella spread, chocolate chip cookies, vanilla ice cream encrusted with BACON! and 6 bucks! \n\nI will definitely be returning when I'm back in Vegas."

Right above Fogo day ciao\n\nThe vibe is really cool, the music playing is alternative with a mix of top 40 and some old-school 90s tunes. The name and the Decour totally match;you walk in and you feel like you're in a science lab or library with chalkboards and comfortable seating. In the bar It's communal seating very long tables with 10-12 stools on either side.  I would coin this as a bar, not a sports bar there was only one TV in the bar that I could see so if you want to watch the basketball games, you'll have to go someplace else. We sat in the bar for only about five minutes, before we even ordered drinks because they were going to allow us to have happy hour on the outdoor patio, which is delightful, great atmosphere, not as noisy as inside, the weather was warm and helpful service.\n\nThe first look; the menus were notebooks you would see in college, they had a small clipboard as well as a happy hour menu. The happy hour menu had 8 to 10 food options along with some wine and beer.  They also had well drink specials to.\n\nI tried just about everything on the appetizer menu, and was disappointed the ahi poke was bland, the PB&J sliders wasn't explained to me that that was actually a hamburger slider with peanut butter and jelly, just didn't go together for our tables liking. My wife loves pizza, so she ordered the margarita pizza, which didn't have enough cheese on it. The pizza sauce was a little spicy which both my wife and I like. I'm a huge hummus fan and was excited to try a white bean hummus to know what that really was, it was OK it needed a little salt to increase the flavor, just to me tasted flat. \n\nThere was no salt-and-pepper on the tables, I try to get a hold my waiter \"Brandon\" it wasn't his fault. I wanted to tell Brandon that the appetizers were mediocre at best and return the pb&j sliders but it was \"good Friday\" and I didn't want to be too picky and \"thankful\" but I had 6 appetizers and not one stood out. Oh that's  not true, I did try the fried cauliflower which was probably the most appetizing appetizer.  The service was very good they leave a water bottle at your table so I don't have to keep asking the waiter every time to fill my water glass cup, I really like that.\n\nI wouldn't go back there for any of their food, if their happy hour appetizers are so boring I wouldn't expect the food to be any better. I would go back for a drink or have a glass of wine with my wife (no food), the brewery across the street at the redrock Casino has far better appetizers and 10 times the amount of choices. \n\nRight before our party of four left I had to make a quick stop in the bathroom, I came out and did see one of the chalkboards talking about their specials I know there was a few errors I'm probably being too picky here but they said their beers for $4-7, I didn't see any beers on the menu that were $4, management should update their signage to properly address that the happy hour menu says."

The hostess told us that we could sit anywhere in the bar area, so we grabbed a table and menus were brought to us almost immediately. Our server then came out with a bottle of water and two cups for us. \n\nI loved the ambiance here because it was super cute and hipster-like. I felt like this would be a place I could find somewhere in Portland. The decor mirrors that of a classroom, so you have yearbooks, dictionaries, encyclopedias, math cards, and all that jazz around the restaurant. The menus itself look like composition notebooks and the theme is followed through to every aspect of the venue. \n\nWe got the Citra Rye Pale Ale. Now, I'm not much of a beer drinker, but this had a lychee and grapefruit scent that followed the bitterness of the beer, which was nice. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it wasn't even expensive! $5 for a glass of this goodness. Perhaps this will be my step towards developing a taste for beer. \n\nWe then ordered a brown bag of fries. The fries were perfectly cooked and came with Siracha Ketchup and mustard BBQ sauce. The ketchup overpowered the Siracha so you can smell the Siracha, but the taste of it is very faint. The mustard BBQ sauce almost tastes like honey bbq. Quite interesting.\n\nWe also got The Cutting Board, which was an assortment of artisan cheeses and cured meats. We had a goat cheese, blue cheese, and sheep cheese with prosciutto and salami. There was also cashews, jam, onions, and other little things on the board with toasted artisan bread thinly sliced in the middle. All very interesting and tasty. It's chef's choice, so this probably changes from day-to-day. \n\nI loved the atmosphere of this place and how cool everything is. I'll definitely want to visit again next time I come into town."

Which is the ONLY reason why I would give this place a star. \n\nI proceed in, and a woman with red hair who kind of reminded me of Ronald McDonald quickly frowns from her fake smile once we turn in. Ultimately I ignored it and didn't care to let one gesture ruin our night. I proceed to say \"2 for balcony please.\" She leads us in right away and offers us any seat in the house and will aware the servers that we are here.\n\n10 minutes later, not one server came. At this point I was losing patience. Several server goes by and not one acknowledges us. I had enough time to have a conversation to reserve a dinner at fogo de chau and ultimately ashamed that I brought my mother in here. Being the sweet woman she was, she agreed that we should just leave. Not only did this place ruin a birthday dinner but was rude in every single way. Will not becoming here any longer. \n\nOn side note: maybe if she apologized when she clearly saw us leaving, I might have reconsidered the whole situation but she instead rudely smirked as we left."

Not to sweet, but the grilled peach with a sweet cheese is amazing to finish the plate. I love how the chefs use their creative  imagination and in depth palate to make such a dish. Two thumbs up!! I am looking forward to the winter menu. Matt was our waiter and he made the brunch a blast. He was attentive, on the ball with everything we needed.

I love the outside patio with giant jenga a beer pong tables.\n\nWe ordered the Tuscan chopped salad; kale, tomatoes, soppressata, burrata, crispy prosciutto. Per the menu it was also supposed to have chickpeas but out of the whole salad we were only able to find one (seriuosly, one!). But overall it was good, and a good size portion for sharing. The pizza we ordered was basic margherita, it was ok. The crust is thin which I like, but almost too thin towards the center so when you pick up a slice you have to fold it. I think it could have been cooked a bit longer? \n\nWe had an awesome server, Erin. She was really hustling for us. Our group was ordering a lot of drinks, she was on top of it and she checked with us very frequently. So aside from Erin, heres the kinks; the drink service could really use some work. It took a looooong time to get drinks. To give an idea, we sat down and ordered drinks right away. After about 5 min we were ready to order food. Our food came out before we had even gotten our drinks!? This isnt the servers fault, they just need a better system at the bar. New place so it takes time. Overall I like this place and I would recommend checking it out."

The restaurant itself is huge and has a fun schoolhouse vibe to it. \n\nOur server was very attentive. As soon as we sat at the table, she greeted us kindly and offered to take our drink orders while we waited for our entire party to arrive. Throughout our dinner she continued to check in on us and kept the drinks flowing. \n\nThe FOOD!!!! Because many in our group were first timers to PS702 we decided to order everything center-table, family style. So glad we did, we were able to taste a good portion of the menu and leave with full and happy tummies! What we ordered...\n\nAppetizers:\nCrispy Buffalo Cauliflower - My favorite out of the apps. Breaded and fried to perfection with a side of blue cheese aioli and buffalo sauce.\nCrispy Ahi Tuna Tacos - While they were good, there really wasn't anything special about them. One order will give you 4 tacos.\nThe Cutting Board - A very generous sized charcuterie board with a tasty selection of meats and cheeses. One board was large enough for our entire party to try. \n\nEntrees:\nShrimp & Grits - One of my favorite plates of the night! A ton of flavor and a nice portion.\nShort Rib - So tender and paired with horseradish mashed potatoes.\nFlat Iron Steak w/ Truffle Butter - I love anything truffle, but I didn't really taste it. The plate did come with chorizo mac and cheese which was the highlight of my night! \nJidori Chicken & Waffles - The entire dish was so flavorful! The chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly. \nLamb Bolognese - My least favorite dish of the night... Don't order, try the above entrees instead! \n\nI will definitely return! Maybe for their brunch!?!!"

My fianc\u00e9 and myself had a manager laugh in our faces when we had a question regarding the menu and wanted the price to be adjusted based on how it was described.\nThere really needs to be a little customer service training for all the employees and managers.

But it had a very strange flavor and atypical meat sauce. I think the only reason I ate it without complaint was due to the utter mortifying food experience and all around bad day my friend was having.\n\nThe chef made things right though by making me an off the menu light salad. The poached pears with mixed greens and prosciutto salad topped with candied pecans and goat cheese was really really good!! I would come back just to have this salad.\n\nFor dessert, I had the lemon meringue with a graham cracker bottom. The dessert looked absolutely scrumptious. The meringue was super good, but the lemon custard was way too sweet for my palate. I had to cut the sweetness between sips of my dark roast and otherwise bitter coffee.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly.

They had a great beer selection, but charged about double what any other place in town charges for premium beers in a bottle.  Not many beers to choose from for their cheaper beers.  The menu was very limited and expensive.  Cheapest burger was $13 and then only a couple to choose from. We ate in the bar which was mainly a sports bar.  3 different TVs going.  Very noisy. Service was good and the food was ok.  I will only go back because I have a little more left on the gift certificate, but when that is done, I won't be back."

While the delicious fat made the burger...delicious, quinoa salad was very meh. I make better? No? You come my house, I feed you. \n Here is my gripe. Yes, we were a group of 22. Yes, it's a PIA. But, we did have a reservation. So ok, can't put tables together- fine, three adjacent tables are totally cool. But not two waiters working at two VERY different speeds and on different schedules, completely independently of each other, except for coordinating the bill. So here it is- while I'm just putting my order in, my coworkers at the other table are getting their food delivered. A bit extreme, if you ask. So they have to wait and stare us down,  while we tuck the napkins into our collars. \n Otherwise, everything went seamlessly. No special urge to go back."

For a week, I've been imagining what it could possibly taste like and feel like until I've finally decided to try it.\n\nBy the entrance is a glass display with sports trophies, Pom poms, Michael Jordan lunchbox, algebra book, calculus book and all things that would remind you of school minus the nun that smacks your hand with a ruler because this is Public School 702. You just get budget cuts.\n\nThe menu would remind you of a notebook and the napkins would remind you of a notepad. Blackboards on the wall and the moon and planets above your head. Hipsters with their glasses, beards, sleeve tats and a beer. 90's hip hop playing in the background.\n\nWe tried the grilled salmon, bison burger, chicken and waffles and the Nutella Cookie Sandwich. The entrees were just ok. The bison burger had a nice spicy kick to it but I also almost had an anaphylactic reaction because of an ingredient that wasn't on the menu description but was somehow in burger. The fries were not great.\n\nThe Nutella Cookie Sandwich would be the only reason I'd come back here. So, you get chocolate chip cookies with Nutella schmeared on the flat side of the cookies, vanilla ice cream in the middle with a wall of bacon brittle. \"I got 5 on it\"...yup, it's only $5 that's big enough for 2-3 people.\n\nThe service could use remedial lessons."

When the service has been great, the food has been mediocre. When the food has been awesome, the service has lacked, and ultimately, I think the service in general leaves alot to be desired. The past few times we have dined there, we weren't greeted promptly, had to wait an unusual amount of time for drinks, or been left without refills for the entire meal, and the food has been a solid three star rating. We do have our favorites on the menu, like the buffalo cauliflower and the charcutterie platter, which have been consistently good. The chicken and waffles, however, has been consistently bland, and sometimes downright bad. The fish and chips is a safe choice, and usually pretty good. The burgers are always hit or miss, and just tonight, we ordered the shorty bowl, which was pretty good, but the egg was cold, and cold runny egg yolk is not my favorite, by far.\n\nI want this place to be better than it is, and at this point, given the cost of the entrees and the lackluster food and service that feels like the staff just doesn't care, I don't think it will be in our rotation any more."

From the blackboard/chalk writings on the walls, their composition menus, binder paper napkins, and more! Such a fun theme especially for adults, getting that feel of old school memories while drinking some beers from the bar. Anyway, great vibes. I especially love that after eating inside, our group went to their outside patio and played some beer pong, life size connect 4 and life size Jenga! We came in and stayed from 11am-4pm. \n\nOh shoot I totally forgot to mention the food!!! Anyway, food was awesome! LOVED their chicken & waffles!! Gotta have that for brunch. Also great to share! My boyfriend got the stuffed French toast so we shared with each other. His order was a little too much on the sweeter side than I prefer, but it was still good! Our whole group also got bottomless mimosas - which carried us onto the outside patio for more drinks to come haha. \n\n~~~ in my update for my review I just wanted to give a shout out to the service my friends and I received today. Honestly I always feel so terrible whenever I go to restaurants with a large group. I understand how large groups could be difficult esp in a setting where drinks are involved.. well today Emilia was our waitress and the entire time, she was super happy, energetic and just really took care of us (keep in mind our group was about 23 people) even when things were getting complicated, esp at the end when we were handling the check and everyone wanted to split it, she never showed that she was bothered or stressed. I have never experienced that with a server while having a big group before, so thank you so much Emilia, you rock. Don't change! ~~"

Everyone who came out later due to the bar area being full was complaining about the heat and the misters would have helped.  I didn't see any heaters either but maybe they plan to set up portable ones in the winter?  \n\nWhile it took a bit to get a waiter out to me I was kind of expecting it since I was the only one there.  He brought me a bottle of water and recommended a few beers to taste which I took him up on (being able to taste the beers before you commit to a pint is really great).  He came back fairly quickly again to let me know that he put in the tastes and to take my food order.  The food came at a good pace (tacos first then broccolini) but I waited, and waited for the beer tastes and my cocktail.  He did come out to let me know the bar was backed up and I finally got my beer to taste and picked one (still didn't have the cocktail).  My beer and cocktail finally came out after newer people's drinks so my server said he was taking the drinks off the bill which I appreciated.\n\nHowever, I let him know I was ready for my bill and then waited, and waited, and waited again until another server who had come out to serve the filling outside area got me my bill.  So the missing two stars are for the slow service.\n\nThe food was good and I will be back again to give it another go.  But a tip for others: Friday happy hour is very popular so get there early!"

Luckily, my party wasn't seated too far away so I was able to spot them from the door. There were six of us and the server was great. Also, the seating was comfortable. I ordered the chicken waffles. I'm weird and don't like eggs so I passed on the fried egg that that the dish is served with. The chicken was good but the waffle was pretty dry. I wouldn't order it again.

Generally with strongly themed restaurants the decore overshadows the taste, But with public-school both were surprisingly well done. We started with the artisan meats and cheeses and bacon tater tots. The tater tots were simply amazing. Obviously hand crafted in-house, the fried combination of hashed potatoes, cheese and bacon was pleasing, but the pairing with sriracha-ketchup was perfect. The meats and cheeses were just ok. The only wow on the platter was the goat cheese with marmalade. For the main course, I had the chicken and waffles with bacon red-eye gravy, syrup and hot sauce. I was highly impressed with the cornmeal waffles and the sauces used to bring the course together. The combination of sweet, salty and spivey from the sauces cut through to traditional home style dish. I loved the meal despite the chicken being ordinary and under spiced. All-in-all, a great meal for the slightly inflated price."

We had no expectation of being seated right away so I'm not sure where her attitude came from. Once we were seated we ordered some appetizers, waters, and drinks. There were four times where all 8 of us had empty glasses of water and had to ask someone to bring us more. I was never brought a refill on my lemonade (I think the fresh lemonade was missing an ingredient so i was ok dealing with water) without asking multiple times for one. One out of four of our appetizers never came out and we had to track down our waiter to remind him to bring it. The food came out and he never checked on our food (or water). One bison burger was ordered medium well and was completely rare. It was picked at around the edges but barely eaten, but I'm sure it didn't phase the lazy waiter. When it was time for our 4 separate checks he pulled the \"our system can't do that\" bs and had us literally write down per couple what we had, the price of each item, add it all up, include tax and give him the tab at the end for him to ring up. It took about 20 minutes to write everything out and then the computer magically rang separate checks. \n\nNow onto the good food: cauliflower buffalo appetizer was my favorite. We also tried the bacon cheese tots, chorizo Mac n cheese, and the calamari, which were all a huge hit. I had the steak with truffle butter and Mac n cheese. It was a good size portion and very tasty! My husband had the bison burger which was pretty good but his was also not cooked properly. The prosciutto pizza was alright but a little difficult to eat because the prosciutto is not cut up into pieces, and the chicken and waffles were great!"

Our friend's got their food about 5 minutes before us... I thought this was very unprofessional as we were telling our friends to go ahead and start eating and they felt awkward eating in front of us. We had ordered medium-well for both the burger and the steak salad and when we got our food, both cuts of meat were very pink. I almost sent my steak salad back but I knew it would take even longer to get it and we had already been waiting a while. The salad lacked flavor and I ended up asking for lemons and vinegar to season it myself. I would still go again here but I would choose something else on the menu and order well-done to avoid having an almost still mooing cow delivered on my plate."

The staff was also friendly and efficient. \nWe got there while they were serving brunch on Saturday afternoon around 1PM, so I got to splurge on their Beermosa. Pretty yummy for my first beer cocktail. What else did we get... Umm...\nAppetizers: Speck & Eggs and Chorizo Mac & Cheese. I, myself, definitely liked both. The boyfriend also had to admit that this was one of the best deviled eggs he's had for the hint of spice they add for flavor. \nEntree: House Pepperoni Pizza for the boyfriend, and a Crispy Chicken Sandwich for me. LOL. Boyfriend enjoyed the pizza, but he was peeved that I told him we'd be having spaghetti for dinner with my family... \"I'm having Italian twice today?!\" XD My sandwich was awesome! Chicken was cooked very well, and I appreciated the crunchy exterior for texture, plus it looked good. Real good... Also enjoyed their version of aioli sauce to the last drop. Oh! I also have to add that the ketchup has a small kick to it. I seriously thought my taste buds were outta whack until I had my boyfriend confirm it wasn't just me drinking too much. \nThe cool part was the Banana Bread Pudding. Hehehe... Dessert ended the meal on a really good note. You have to ask your server about their dessert menu though 'cause it's verbally described to you.\nNot including tip for everything we had, it came out to be around $63. Worth it...!\nLOL. Now I know why my sister and brother-in-law keep coming out here without me."

A very modern and hip restaurant at that, themed after school/education like atmosphere. Everything from their menus to decorations sets the place off right. This huge place located on the second floor also has an outdoor balcony area that almost rivals the inside seating of course depending on weather. This casual yet up beat restaurant provides quick and friendly service by their staff who are also dressed casual. Not quite sure, we came on a weekend and noticed a weekend menu...so there might be a separate weekday one as well. They also have happy hour which they call recess which plays to the theme. Menu choices were kinda small but quality and choices were there. It is a bar and grill brewery type of restaurant so expect the usual burgers and custom beers and alcohol. Choices of even Lamb and Bison burgers which were tender, juicy and mouthwatering delicious. Still Public School 702 is family and kid friendly & very refreshing. As casual as it is, it still gives you that classy feeling with fun elegance. Prices are average and maybe slightly a little more for casual dining...but service and ambience make up for it as well as the food. Definitely recommend this place, at least to try out once or twice if you are in the area or after a long day shopping in Downtown Summerlin."

It feels like a sad rip off of the farm-to-table places serving up memorable meals in Portland, Denver and beyond.\n\nOn the plus, I really liked the atmosphere.  Cool upstairs location. Neat notebook style menu and napkins themed like post it notes. Very cool.\n\nThe beer list is good. But beware that they don't actually have a lot of the stuff. My first two beer choices were met with a \"sorry, we're out of that.\" This includes Sierra Nevada Killerweis. Not exactly impossible to keep in stock.\n\nThe server - who was very kind - forgot to put in the order of the grilled Cauliflower appetizer. Too bad because most of the reviews on her, as well as my companion, raved about the dish.\n\nWe ordered a couple of different things. An uninspired steak salad and \"short ribs.\" Perhaps my understanding of short ribs is off. But what we got was a crockpot-style roast on a bed of flavorless mashed potatoes. \n\nSo be it. Probably a good place of a happy hour drink or 3. But must say the missing beers, never appearing appetizers and lackluster main course put this place in the loss column for me."

When the waiter came to take my order, I said I'd not be eating since there isn't a vegan option and he said he'd see if he could fix that. The chef made a wonderful poached pear salad with arugula and candied pecans. Then, for desert, I was completely surprised to be delivered a lovely poached pear sort of taco with fried pastry dough as the shell and chocolate and powdered sugar. It was my first time having pears and it was absolutely delicious. I really appreciate them going to far to accommodate my dietary preferences and not just for the entree, but dessert - it was really sweet of them, and they are lucky to have such a stellar chef! Many places are nice and modify what they can to make recipe's vegan, but pretty much none make a vegan dessert.\n\nMy coworkers really all loved their meals, especially the buffalo cauliflower. Give this place a shot! The atmosphere, staff, and food are wonderful."

We originally sat a lot a table in the middle of the bar but moved over to a booth once it was cleaned. The food was pretty good, the service was just ok. Our server didn't say more than 10 words to us the whole hour and a half we were there. I understand it was happy hour but when we got there, it didn't look too terribly busy?? She didn't ask why we switched tables. She didn't ask if the food was tasting ok. She said the most when she dropped off the tab. \n\nPros: chargers under the bar, happy hour prices, and at each table by the bar area, laid back cool atmosphere, menus are composition notebooks, super clever! They do have wifi, cute little bookshelves, math cards all around to really make it feel like a school atmosphere, outdoor seating looking over downtown summerlin, the outdoor seating has fans everywhere.. Also a life size connect four \n\nCons: waitress did seem like she was in a huge hurry when we first sat down, despite the restaurant not looking busy \n\n\nTip*** wifi name is under public school and the password is public school\n\nHappy hour food: I highly recommend the ahi poke, it was delicious!! Also the fried cauliflower with buffalo sauce was very good. And the red quinoa salad was my personal favorite. \n\nWould I go back? Overall I would go back to try some more things. The food was pretty good. The service was a bit lacking to me but I would go again"

During this time Valarie is taking new tables and forgets almost every step that you need to do. She comes back with WATER FINALLY!!!! \n\nShe comes back to take our food order and I said \"how about taking my friends drink order first before you walk away\" she laughs and says \"ok what can I get for you\"\n\nI wanted to walk out but I saw some cool food items and I was starving and $10 bottomless mimosa I thought it was a great deal! So she takes a drink order for everyone and waited another 10 min just to get them......IM SO FREAKEN FRUSTRATED AT THIS POINT....Im am realizing that out food order is going to take even longer. So I flag down a server to help us and that it would be nice to get us another server that knows what they are doing. Bloody Mary was super spicy, like they put a whole thing of pepper and Tabasco. We put it to the side and never drank it. The rest of the girls had water since it was the quickest thing to quench our thirst. \n\nFinally ordered FOOD! Tots, smothered burrito, Fried Califlower, speck & eggs, mac & chz , ahi tacos.......The only thing that was good because they were cold items were Speck & Eggs and Ahi Tacos. \n\nThe tots looked like charcoal with sauce on the side.....WTF? The funny thing is someone actually put this on the table???? Smothered burrito was so hard my friend could barley cut through the tortilla....the eggs tasted rotten.....It was horrible. \nAnything that was served hot was disgusting. Mac & Chz was dry and the chorizo was like rocks.....\n\nWe spoke to a manager and he replaced 2 items the burrito and Tots. During this time I had asked for another bottomless mimosa over 15 min as my glass was empty (glass where are so small its so stupid). \n\nDuring this time there was a couple having brunch for fathers day and they had there burger made 4 TIMES! This guy was so pissed instead they gave him a nutella ice cream dessert....???? ARE U SERIOUS! As there was a food critic right behind them and ordered a salad and took 2 bites and left. \n\nThe energy surrounding us was so weird and off.  During this whole time Valarie came by maybe 2 times and said \"Is everything ok?\" We just said yes because we were so upset how things were going that we just wanted to speak to a manager. We told him what was going on and he said he was so sorry and he would take care of the bill. His name was Nick...He seemed not authentic with his apology. There was no deep apology other than he was sorry and he would take care of it. Maybe because he was going to every table around us hearing the same story.....Give this place 2 months to fire and re-hire a solid staff that can handle a fast pace restaurant and hopefully they can hire people that are passionate about there brand! WACK!"

            "review": "Allow me to give a full explanation into why I would give Public School 702 a 3 star rating rather than the 5 I'd have given if rating on the Culver City location.\n\nMy girlfriend came in from out of town as I just relocated from Long Beach to Las Vegas. It was my birthday and lunch was on the agenda. PC offers \"Almost\" Bottomless Mimosas at $10 for a carafe which is approximately 4 glasses per carafe. Instead of orange juice, myself and another friend ordered them with pineapple juice. The waitress took the order and returned with one glass of Mimosa for my friend AND nothing for the rest of us. We then realized she never took anyone else's order. First faux pas. \n\nWe finally put in our drink orders; my pineapple \"Almost\" bottomless Mimosa should be in a carafe but is instead served with only a glass (my girlfriend receives hers in a glass as well minus the carafe but with 'garnish'. My glass, nada. The garnish was the rind of the pineapple. Not a slice OF the pineapple....just the rind), a Sprite and a bloody Mary (garnished with fried chicken). \n\nBut before the drinks arrive.....\nWe ordered our food.   \n\n#1. Lemon Meringue pie\n#2. Tatters (burned and sent back to the kitchen), buffalo cauliflower, deviled eggs garnished w/ bacon\n#3. Chorizo mac n' cheese\n#4. Ahi tuna tacos\n#5. Burrito (unknown but over cooked. Sent back to the kitchen)\n\nSo, our food & drinks arrived within moments of one another. Sounds legit except we had been waiting awhile for our drinks before even putting in our order for food. As stated above, we asked for PINEAPPLE but TWICE orange juice was brought to the table. Food was way over cooked. Our server blamed the kitchen for the burned food and the bar for our delayed drinks. While I realize how challenging food service can be, its part of your responsibility to check orders before bringing them to the table. \n\nAt the opposite end of the table, we watched a gentleman return his burger FOUR times. However, they did bragged about the Nutella dessert. Behind them, a food critic seemed to cringe at every entree, app and salad ordered; while on the other side of us we saw another couple complain and send back their drinks. \n\nI did call on the manager because I do enjoy dining at Public School and would love to return with a positive experience. On that, he was very apologetic and ended up compensating our entire meal, drinks included. I'm not saying you should go into every restaurant to find fault only to get your meals comp'd however an establishment such as Public School can only get better with constructive feedback. Had this been my first ever visit, I'd have had a whole other perspective of disappointment, but I have enjoyed their fare prior and it is quite tasty. That Lemon Meringue was off the hizzy! It was our first entree of the day. I also enjoyed the Buffalo cauliflowerl. My chorizo mac n cheese was super interesting topped with sea salted potato chips and the chorizo was actual spicy sausage. I'd for sure recommend it.\n\nThank you, Nick, for handling the issue as professionally as you did. I will return, as you requested, in about a month with my girlfriend to give it another try. Lets shoot for a FIVE star"

Thy didn't have much signage on the ground level so it took me a minute to find from the backside of the mall, but that's an easy fix. I enjoyed their flat breads and crispy tater tots with spicy ketchup. The service was definitely spotty, we had a sassy waitress that at one point told us - \"sorry, we are not taking drink orders right now, the bar is too busy.\" I thought that was pretty interesting since we were at a BAR, a place that most likely relies on a huge portion of revenue from their bar sales. So I told her, damn you guys must not want to make money. So she unhappily said she would put our drink orders in and low and behold my beer came out within 2 minutes. The 3 hours I was there, I was able to barely get two drinks from our server who only asked if I needed anything else at the end of the night when the place cleared. I won't judge this place on the bad service though because I have heard good things and will definitely return just maybe when they are not too busy to serve me a drink."

And even then the person who took the order admitted she wasn't our server, but would get us started so we didn't have to wait any longer. Our actual server (Jaimie) didn't come over until the food was already delivered to the table. Its unfortunate because the food was amazing and the atmosphere is so cool, especially the patio area. Just wish the experience had been better. I work food and bev as well and don't get a lot of Sunday's off so I was really looking forward to this. My roommate and I were going to order shots, another round of drinks, and even a couple more apps, but she dropped off the check without even asking if there was anything more we needed. So we just finished our drinks and went elsewhere to make the most of our Sunday Funday. Would consider coming back again assuming maybe she was just having a bad day and next time maybe the experience would be better."

So when our server, Carissa did come over we told her we had been waiting for 15 minutes and she gave us attitude and just said \"ok, there was confusion with the tables\". And she wasn't very nice about it either. We placed our order and it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. Our food came fairly quick and I'm sad to say it was not worth the wait. I had the seared scallop salad and it was very bland. I would have asked for more dressing but Carissa was no where to be found. The entire time we were there she checked on us once, she was not pleasant at all or even smiled. Such a shame because the atmosphere of the restaurant is fun, cute decor, and quite a fun bar menu, but I don't feel we will be back due to the horrible service we received.

In a moment of ill timing, a large group of folks came up inquiring about the wait, which left my Mimi and I standing there for several minutes. The space isn't really designed for loitering, so it was very awkward and for a moment, we were confused as to whether it was seat yourself or not.\n\nOther than that, the food was pretty good! We ordered the buffalo cauliflower as an appetizer, which was fabulous. We also opted for salads for dinner--my Mimi the beet salad and I the Kale caesar with salmon. The salads were also excellent.\n\nService wasn't the best. Our server was nice, but a little slow. I ordered a beer, only for him to come back 10 minutes later to say it was tapped out and then it took him another 10 minutes to bring a replacement sample.

We came here for a Saturday brunch , sat at the bar and we experienced intermittent to zero service.  The staff seemed like they didnt care at all.  We ordered the breakfast burritto without cheese and we were told since it was \"premade\" they couldnt customize it at all.  When the food came out it tasted like it was overbaked, dry, sauceless and tasteless and on top of it it was heavy and seemed deep fried.  Furthermore, we ordered bottomless drinks and we got a mimosa on average once every 25 minutes on average.  This is truly unacceptable from a Las Vegas standard I would expect more from an institution especially since its among several fine restaurants in Downtown Summerlin.  I hope the management reviews this carefully and takes it constructively because they really should step up their game - until then I would unlikely come here again or recommend it to family and friends.

            "review": "Having wanted to try the original downtown LA location for the longest time, and just never getting the chance to, Public School 702 was probably one of my more anticipated restaurant openings this year. This new location in Downtown Summerlin sits on the upper level between Crave, and the yet to open second Shake Shack. It's a pretty large space with a lot of seating, a good size bar area, and an outdoor patio as well. But even with all that, it gets busy, and you'll likely have to wait for a table. For just 2 people at 7:30 on a Wednesday night, the wait still tipped 30 minutes.\n\nAfter being seated, we were handed their regular notebook style menu that has a quite a few appetizers, and all kinds of entrees from burgers to chicken and waffles. We were also handed a separate list of their current rotating tap beers. That's one of my favorite parts about PS702. Not only is there \"normal\" beer list all craft offerings, but their rotating stuff seems to be filled with unique and even some hard to find limited release stuff. If you're not a beer drinker though, they've got plenty of cocktails and wines too.\n\nSince there was only 2 of us and pretty much every appetizer on the menu sounded good, we decided to get a few items to share, and then split one dinner. We started off with some of the smaller items, the Speck & Eggs, and the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. At just $6 for either of these, they are must try starters in my opinion. The eggs were perfectly boiled, had a creamy yok filling, and the little piece of proscuitto was a nice salty, crispy touch. And the buffalo cauliflower was excellent. We've had a few different versions of it at other places in California, where it seems to be more popular, and PS702's was excellent. It's got a thicker breading and was served piping hot with sauce on the side, instead of tossed.\n\nThe other appetizers we tried were a little on the bigger side. Their Mezze Plate is huge for $8 and includes 5 different things to pick off or dip in, and huge stack of thin, crispy pita-like bread. My favorite things were the marinated feta, and something I had never had anywhere else before, crispy chickpeas. We also really enjoyd the Chorizo Mac & Cheese. It was the most expensive starter we got at $9, but well worth it. The pasta was cooked perfectly, it's super cheesy, there's plenty of chorizo in it, and even though I thought it was strange at first, the salt and vinegar chips on top added both flavor and texture.\n\nBy this time, we were pretty full, but our order of the Fried Jidori Chicken & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles was already on the way. Sadly, it didn't impress nearly as much as the appetizers, especially with it's $22 price tag. I personally really liked the slightly spicy waffle with the cornbread like texture, but the wifey wasn't a fan. And even though the flavor on the chicken was excellent, it was mushy and only one part, a leg, was bone-in. The gravy had good flavor as well, but because the chicken was soggy, it made the whole dish just overly mushy. Had the chicken been crispy, this would have been a huge hit for me.\n\nUnlike a lot of the other reviews, our service was excellent. We even found out later on during our meal that our waiter was in training. He did an excellent job though, and no complaints from me at all in the area.\n\nPS702 is a little on the pricy side, especially when you get drinks, but it's not out of this world crazy. With both of us getting drinks, then adding on 4 appetizers and a main entree, we only spent about $90 with tip. Besides the main chicken and waffles dish being a bit of a let down, it was well worth it, and I've got to say PS702 is one of my new favorites in Downtown Summerlin, so I can't wait to go back."

If you like beer, they have a great beer list. Their brunch menu is one of the best in town. My personal favorites are the chicken and waffles or the French toast. I highly recommend this spot!"

We ordered the Jidori fried chicken and jalape\u00f1o cornmeal waffles, salmon with succotash, ahi tuna salad and eggs Benedict pizza. The fried chicken was moist and delicious gravy on the side; the cornmeal waffles were the highlight of the dish. The pizza was out of this world delicious. It was a thin crust pizza with egg and hollandaise sauce on it. The salmon was so moist and perfectly done. The succotash with citrus sauce was an unexpected delight. Even the standard ahi tuna salad was really good. I am looking forward to coming back here again and trying everything!"

After some shopping at Sur la Table, Hubby chose Public School 702.  I must say, the concept is neat.  It definitely resembles a public school.  The menu was quite extensive but after reading some trustworthy reviews on yelp, we went for the naked wings and the Jidori spiced chicken and waffles.  The portion was humongous.  Earl also ordered a citrus beer and I took a small sip.  I think all beer is yucky but this one was interesting...it started out sour, then got kind of buttery creamy taste.  I liked it very much though I can't drink to much since I am still nursing.\n\nThe ambiance was very nice since we sat out in the patio on this beautiful day."

We arrived just before happy hour ended, we had about a 15 min wait for an outside table on a weekday. The food was decent, we tried the margarita pizza, Mac and cheese, PB&J sliders and truffle fries.  The pizza was the best, but with a very soft crust, Mac and cheese was good but the chorizo had an off taste, truffle fries were soso and the sliders were just weird. The service was sub par, with smaller glasses I kinda feel like they should come back to check more often. I had my iced tea empty for over half the meal, the server was also MIA for quite a while, I don't know if he had tables inside toot was just inattentive. Lots of hype and I can't really see why."

We expressed our disgust with what had happened and he said he would talk to his manager. Once he returned with a clean bottle we asked what the manager said and he responded with \"he didn't say much\". We were appalled! The manager then finally came by and asked \"what would you like me to do?\" It was like pulling teeth for good service.

Thought it would've been cool to have gym themed locker rooms for their bathrooms, complete with moldy gym towels in a hamper...maybe that would be taking it too far?\n\nWe had a drink (prices not bad for happy hour) and the flat bread with hummus and baba ganoush. Both were awesome. The overall menu is very gastropub-style and I'll be back at some point to try some of their food. Would also check out the outdoor seating, on a deck that is shaded in the afternoon. Wise planing, very wise."

It is decorated by old public school relics and there is definitely some interesting history pieces of Las Vegas as well. We sat ourselves in the bar which is open seating and was great since we didn't have to wait. Our server was a comical and energetic gentlemen named Jared. Great personality for a server. The craft beer menu is daunting but he got us some samples of recommendations and we all found something we liked. We ordered food family style so we could all try everything. We ordered the tots, Mac and cheese, pepperoni pizza and the Tuscan salad. Everything was awesome, it came out staggered so we're able to try it all hot and fresh. We would have tried the cookie sandwich but were stuffed. Well come back and try it next time as well definitely be back. If you're going see if Jared's working. He said there were two of them though so ask for Jared Smithe."

My boyfriend got the bison burger once which he loved and got the salmon which was perfectly cooked.  We also had the buffalo cauliflower which fits great info my current cauliflower obsession.  My favorite thing, though, may be the Brussels sprout slaw.  I'm trying to recreate it at home so I can have it all the time.  The beer selection is awesome and fun.  The servers are ok but sometimes adapt the hipster attitudes on top of the dress code. This isn't Brooklyn; you can keep the clothes but lose the tude.  The biggest complaint... It's too frickin loud.  Not the music- it would be great if I could hear that better because they have a good playlist.  It's the crowd noise that is overbearing.  I hope they find a way to lower it but with the ceiling so high I doubt it's possible.  I'm sure it's nicer out on their huge patio."

A seat on the outside patio in the evening would be nice and I have a feeling will fill up quickly for dinner, especially when the weather is nice. We had the mezzo platter (small portions of hummus, babaganoush, olive tapenade, feta, roasted chickpeas and pita), grilled watermelon and tomato stack salad, bangers and mash, tacos and a couple kids meals. Don't have a bad thing to say about the taste and quality of the food. All was delicious. Kids meals were standard. The tacos stood out, so good. Very trendy, slightly pricey, but nothing absorbent or out of the ordinary for the area. Didn't try any beer, seemed to be a decent selection. We'll come back for lunch to try some new stuff and I'd love to come back and see the dinner menu. Our poor server had a slight mishap with the mustard but she was very sweet and felt super bad.

I'm glad I made the change and so was my friend.\n\nWe came in and the placed was very spacious, well lighted with natural light from the glass windows. The globes on the ceiling was very nostalgic. So were the chalk boards and even down to that weird smelling brown paper towels they used in elementary school (I know they also use it at other places but still).\n\nAnother surprise was when we were sat down and saw the menu. The throwback to the notebook, the scanttron test menu for brunch and the napkins! Once we were down with the nostalgia overload (and I so wanted to grab a pencil #2 and fill in the test ), my friend and I went through the menu. \n\nEverything was decently priced and we so wanted to order everything but we had to control ourselves. Our waitress, Kaila, suggested we do the Beermosa... wow. I didn't think beer and champagne would be great together but I was proven wrong. That and $10 for a bottomless, why not?\n\nWe ordered the mezze plate, mac and cheese and ahi tuna nicoise.\n\nMezze plate looked like it could feed 3-4 people but between me and my friend we did our best. The highlight was the nice firm and not too salty marinated feta, tapenade and hummus. The Flatbread was nicely grilled and perfect. Downside was the babaghanoush needed more citrus and salt/seasoning. The fried chickpeas was ok. But for next time I will try and see if they can accommodate a double babaghanoush and hummus only :-3\n\nAhi tuna nicoise was great.  Big portion. Would serve 1 person for a full lunch meal but great split between two people. We were given the wrong salad initially ( we were served the scallop and Brussels sprouts salad... was so tempted to say yes that it was our salad and that she forgot  our ahi but we are definitely coming back to try that salad ). The dressing was great. Perfect citrus notes and  not too over powering. The take on the eggs being served \"deviled\" style was a nice surprise. Bibb lettuce had not lost its very little crunch to it (meaning the salad was perfectly dressed). The one thing we did not care for was the potatoes.  It seemed like an after thought to their composition as it had no salt/seasoning. Trying to mix it with the salad dressing didn't save it so we just picked around it.\n\nThe fact that we had to stop ourselves with this order should tell you the portions are great. We got the bacon mac and cheese.. and man seeing those salt and vinegar chips on top.. I was in love with the dish. Not too cheesey and not too dry. One of the best mac and cheeses (sorry for me you guys haven't beat out Beecher's Mac and Cheese).\n\nThese little nuances is not the cause of the 4 star rating.  The rating mostly goes to the amount  of Beermosa refills we had. You guys have definitely beat out DW Bistro for my go to brunch place from now on, but the lag on the drink refills was the one that did you in. My tip to myself for future visits and to others with a small group... sit at the bar and see if they can fill up your drinks on the fly without the wait.\n\nOther than that I will definitely be back along with some friends in the near future!  Definitely have to come back and try the Recess!"

They carried the school theme out very well in the decor and it was fun. We ordered food off the happy hour and regular menu. My friend got the Parmesan fries, which were excellent, and the wings and cauliflower which she said were just ok/good. My other girlfriend ordered the poblano and quinoa. The pepper was good but the rice was very bland; almost no flavor at all. For $16- not with it. I ordered the margherita pizza, which was good, once I got it. Unfortunately, they forgot to make it so it took awhile. The good thing is they comped it, which was nice and done so without me asking. \n\nMy only complaint is the drink prices. I spent $27 on two glasses of wine. And it was nothing special, just house Chardonnay. $11/glass is outrageous for a house glass of wine. I also noticed happy hour beers were very, very limited. Regular cocktail prices were upwards of $15-$16 a piece. \n\nOverall, it was decent. I probably won't go back unless it ends up being a meeting place decided on by others."

One note on the tots- we've had spectacular tots and we've had tots with weird texture, still good, but not over the moon good.\n\nI've had 2 brunch entrees so far and highly recommend both dishes, one light, the other is richer. First- the beet salad with arugula, I added a poached egg on top, is my fave. It's presented \"prettily\", flavorful and light. It has a delicious pomegranate dressing to top it all off. The poached egg took it up a notch! I think this is my favorite overall dish for PS702.\n\nOn the rich side was the chicken sausage & cheddar grits- lots of big flavors from grilled tomatoes, grilled corn & bacon. Get the eggs over medium and let that gooey goodness melt down into the grits. I really enjoyed the chicken sausage in the dish. It was so yummy and I had too many starters to finish but reeeaaalllyy wished I could have!! So, hint- it's fill-ing. I definitely recommend their bottomless mimosas, and they do keep them coming.\n\nGreat happy hour, lots of variety to choose from; beer and wine by the half liter & food specials. Enjoyed the buffalo crispy cauliflower the most! The buffalo sauce provides a good kick in the pants. Give the Sriracha ketchup a try with the cauliflower, I dug the combo! Overall, I've enjoyed each visit in different ways - although service has been slow (friendly but slow in refills ordering the next rounds) we are patient and will keep coming back for more."

My friends and I arrived at 9pm on a Thursday. We walk in and two people are talking at the doorway. Oh wait, they're not just two people who are hanging out lounging on the doorway with horrible posture, they work here apparently despite their nonchalance toward any potential customers. \n\nWe were seated in a HUGE booth for the 3 of us that was unbussed with crumbs and sticky crap all over. Lovely. When asking for directions to the restrooms, same rude service. So we get our table cleaned, find the bathroom, and eventually order some very mediocre food. Fried cauliflower is NOT amazing like everyone describes. It's exactly what it sounds like. It's just fried cauliflower for $9 or something. I think their mark-up on this is 999981625536% as a head of cauliflower is $.89 at the store.\n\nWe ordered the chicken & waffles that everyone raved of and was shown on our menu. We were given tandoori brick chicken instead? I guess our waitress didn't hear us, but the mystery gets thicker... apparently chicken & waffles is no longer on the menu, despite what we saw infront of our eyes! So the host who was lounging at the door is handing out old menus and the server who assumed we said one thing didn't ask again to clarify. So when she brings out the wrong item, she said \"is that okay? Do you want to keep it?\" Ha!!! If someone ordered chicken and waffles, do you think tandoori brick chicken with middle eastern spices will fill that craving? No. Of course we don't want the brick chief and want chicken and waffles which despite being off the menu, they made for us? \n\nSo we finally get the chicken and waffles. Waffles were good hitting every one of my taste buds - sweet, savory, luscious, crispy. The chicken was disgusting. They were fried chicken tenders, but the tenders were HUGE and cut poorly. Think about a 3 inch chicken tender... The only good thing we ate was the kale Caesar salad which I would order again if someone dragged me to public school 702. If I wasn't bound and dragged, you would never find me here again. \n\nMy review is confusing, but so was our experience. Everything about the night contradicted another. Hosts, servers, and chefs had no idea what was going on and were not working as a team. The restaurant has been open long enough to fix these issues so there are no excuses for our disappointing night."

(We ordered the ahi tuna poke, bacon cheddar tots, pizza, buffalo cauliflower & Brussels sprouts. All were delicious, however, you could probably do without the ahi poke. Wasn't as fresh as I would have liked it to be).\n\nThey have beer on rotations as well as the beer on the left side of their menu. Go for those on rotations and ask your server if you'd like to try something before getting it! If you're not a fan of beers, they do have wine and a full bar!

From ordering drinks, to appetizers, to food, and for the check I would definitely say each thing took about 25 minutes. One of the drinks we ordered came out wrong and when we told the waitress she replied \"nope that's yours\" and then came back and said \"I think you were right I dropped off the wrong drink\"...we know. \nFirst rule of customer service, \"THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!\"\n\nSecond and third time, I came to recess aka happy hour. The service was awesome, but once again the food was just mediocre. \nI suggest happy hour, but not dinner. Definitely not worth the prices."

It's really a neat space, and it's perfectly situated for people watching and long brunches. I loved the green chile chicken and waffles, and the peanut butter and jelly french toast was pretty good, too. The \"nearly bottomless\" mimosa was the best I've ever had; it's clearly hand-pressed, fresh juice. The staff is also amazing: they really get what a great customer experience should be, and they take pains to ensure every guest is having a good time."

In addition to our non-existent waiter, we didn't receive our drinks until we had already received the check. I decided to give them a second chance and went in last night for industry night at around 9 o'clock. We sat in the bar area and I had high hopes because they were NOT busy. I saw at least 3 waiters walk past our table with no acknowledgement towards us. After waiting 20 minutes with no one coming by to take our order we left. We decided to go to The Yard House where the bartenders are friendly and the service is great! I will not return to Public School 702."

First of all, I called to get their address and THE RECEPTIONIST HUFFED AND PUFFED  at me because, she didn't know the zip code or the street address. The wait was 45 min and there was a long line of people. So I thought, \"ok,status quo it's a new restaurant\" BUT, most of employees are temporary transplants from other public school restaurants. I manage to get a crush velvet & a bourbon of some sort at the bar from the bar manager as the bar is inhabited by couch potatoes nursing their draft beers. I noticed several group of people leave the line and I am now close enough to see there are empty booths in the bar section, empty tables, empty communal tables large enough to seat a party of 5, ( we are 2). I walk up to the menu management gal at the podium and asked if we could sit at the communal tables and I was told, \"you need a reservation to be seated.\" I think to myself, \"I NEED A RESERVATION TO SIT IN THE BAR AT A COMMUNAL TABLE?\" Why? I quickly scan the dining room on the other side and there are serval tables(besides the booths & tables in the bar) that are EMPTY!i I say to the menu management gal, \" I need a reservation to sit in the bar?\" Since when? Other Public school restaurants allow walk up sit down at the communal tables. Doesn't that defeat the concept of COMMUNAL? The best part was when a gal, I'll just call her \"in charge\" asked if I'd like to \" sit out side...... \"....In 110 degree heat?  Really? Now why would she offer outside when there are several available tables in EVERY SECTION OF THAT HUGE  restaurant. If this new restaurant is trying to create the allure of something out of the velvet rope days of Studio 54 they are missing the mark! You are located in a brand new mall with many trendy restaurants. People can easily go elsewhere and will......and I did.  GRADE: FAIL!"

We had the following:\n\nBeers:  They have a seasons selection that changes, if you can't make up your mind you can get little tasters.  I ended up with this golden ale that tasted more like a Guinness but with coffee flavors.  Interesting tasting beer for sure.\n\nChorizo Mac n Cheese:  AWESOME!  We're fans of salt and vinegar chips so to top off the chorizo Mac n cheese with that just added that extra pop.  It does have some greens, kale, but it's hardly noticeable for those non veggie lovers.\n\nGrilled Watermelon and Heirloom Tomatoes:  Surprisingly this was a great refreshing plate for the summer, definitely a winner in our book.\n\nChicken and Green Chile Cornbread Waffles:  Heard a lot of great reviews for this, but was a bit disappointed with this one.  The chicken was pretty tender, but the waffle itself was pretty dry and a bit hard to eat without extra gravy and sauce on top of it.\n\nShort Rib:  This dish was delicious!  Tender short rib draped over the mashed potatoes with some grilled onions.  This came out steaming hot, but the flavors were on spot.\n\nNutella Ice Cream Cookie:  A lot of reviews about this one too, we liked it for the most part but after a few bites it gets too much.  It's a decent size so if you have a group of four it would be perfect to split.  The nice thing about this dessert is the ice cream has bacon bits for those bacon lovers!\n\nOverall the service was great, we had a super friendly waitress.  She was helpful with suggestions and also joked with everyone when she came to the table.  We'll definitely be coming back here!"

I was pleasantly surprised to enter a bustling mid afternoon lunch crowd with music blarring.  \n\nAfter browsing the menu and being informed of the $4 brunch beer specials. I decided I will take TWO! Start off with a Duvel Belgium brew which was good. More of a lager than my preference of IPA but still a tasty brew. Round two was a Live Free or Die! Brew from SF which satisfied my hoppy taste buds.  \n\nFor eats I went with the CCB.  A chicken burger with avocado, thick bacon, red onion, blue cheese aioli, bib lettuce, tomato jam and a fried egg over med.  Eggs on sandwiches means egg all over everything especially your hands. I did my best impression of Guy Fieri wirh my elbows up to not end up wearing this mountain of a burger.  The unique combination of ingredients definitely made this a tasty \"sammy\". You have been warned though it is messy. I felt bad destroying the fine white linen napkins with my messy hands and face.  The fires on the side were a perfect crispy golden brown and seasoned appropriately.  I like the natural cut with the skins still in play.  The sirracha ketchup on the side was perfectly balanced and not too spicy to kill the flavor. Nicely done indeed. \n\nOverall great visit. I cannot wait to come back in the fall to enjoy the 2nd level outdoor patio seating."

The inside of the restaurant was packed, no seating at all, and the noise was deafening. I was glad we were able to find a seat outside. Even outside was getting super packed. If tables were full, people were sitting on the arms of couches or standing. \n\nOur server, Vanessa, was incredible. Honestly, it's been awhile since I've received such good service. She was great with beer and appetizer suggestions. And, as they were so busy, she let us know that things would take awhile to come out. What a concept! I feel that more waitstaff members in Vegas need to be doing this! It's an easy to set realistic expectations and enable diners to plan accordingly. \n\nDrink orders, as warned, took awhile. But I was surprised how quickly everything else came out. Our total order was two rounds of beers and two appetizers: Buffalo cauliflower and Mezza plate. They make the mezza plate with white bean hummus. So, if you are a hummus hater, do not despair. Try this instead! The buffalo cauliflower DOES live up to the hype. GET IT. Don't think, just do it. Although, I'm really not a fan of the chunky blue cheese dressing that goes with this. \n\nAdded bonus: Our waitress noticed we had too much humus and not enough bread and brought more out free of charge. \n\nThank you, Vanessa, for the amazing service!"

I didn't have any appetizers but I did see the faces of those that did...and they were very happy ones. :) A few of the ape's they ordered were: buffalo cauliflower (like hot wings, but fried cauliflower instead) and deviled eggs (looked awesome).\n\nBetween the 13 of us, everyone tried lots of different food - I had the farro & brussel salad with seared scallops and it was incredible!  The flavor profile was unique (with a sweet curry dressing) and the scallops were cooked VERY well.  (I feel like it's so easy to screw scallops up, and they did SUCH a good job!)  The bison burger looked fantastic and the mac and cheese looked even better.  \n\nOH - and the beer menu is LEGIT!  PLUS...can we discuss this amazing thing that happened at 9PM?  A crazy buzzer went off and for the next 15 minutes, all the draft beers were just a DOLLAR.  15 minutes later, the buzzer went off again, and they went up to $2. (They do this every 15 minutes til 10PM.) \n\nAlso - one of the servers, Jamie F, was freaking awesome.  I asked her to help me choose what to order and she was super thorough and went through the handful of dishes I had questions about.  (Plus, I ended up getting what I really wanted.)

Just make sure to get order what you need when you see the server, it takes a minute for them to get to you.\n\nFood: I read a review below that indicated nothing really stood out. I agree with that review. Nothing really stood out, which is not necessarily bad, but also not good. Restaurants need a specific dish or two to stand out and make guests think, \"I want to go there again!\" \n\nWatermelon tomato appetizer was mediocre. I've been to places that were able to use a balsamic dressing to complement the sweetness of watermelons perfectly. Here, I believe they are trying to do too much with the dressing. The yellow tomato was kind of confusing. The first piece my girlfriend and I had were bland, the second piece on the bottom had more flavor. \n\nCharcuterie board was nothing really special. I would prefer to go down the street to hearthstone for a better selection.\n\nChicken and waffles was also missing something. Perhaps the thick cut bacon is what never does it for me. I'm more a crispy bacon kind of person. That bacon made the gravy really chunky, and not as appealing as it could have been. The corn bread waffle could have use an extra minute in the waffle iron. They serve the chicken on top of the waffle, and slightly covered in the gravy, and an extra side of that same gravy. I would recommend getting that gravy on the side so that your fried chicken doesn't get soggy."

I love that they make each location unique to its area code, including the menus.\n\nSERVICE\nIf service was amazing this place would definitely be a 5/5 in my book. It can get very unorganized and since the employees are dressed casually it's sometimes difficult to tell who is who. In addition, some of them are not the friendliest people and I sometimes feel like I'm burdening them when I keep having to get their attention.\n\nHowever, some servers are super friendly and go above and beyond. It really is hit or miss here. One cool thing is that you can get samples of any of the drinks! They bring you a little shot glass of beer to try things out.\n\nFOOD & DRINK\nTwo words: CUTTING. BOARD.\n\nI don't know why I'm so obsessed with it but the Cutting Board ($14 appetizer charcuterie plate) is just bomb to me! It's a combination of the delicious cured meats, cheese, and thin crispy bread. They meld together so well! Also love the onion and capers. It's so worth.\n\nAlso the AHI TUNA TACOS are amazing. I have never liked those kind of newfangled tacos (I'll stick to my adobada and tripa, thank you) but this one had the perfect amount of freshness, delicate fish, and thin crisp. It just melts in your mouth! $10 gets you 4 tacos.\n\nI had a couple other dishes but none of them really made an impression. As for drinks, I have only tried a few of the craft beers on their menu. Campfire Stout is alright but I was happy to see they carried Ninkasi Dawn of the Red. \n\nThe bill can get a little costly here (depending on your appetite for food and alcohol) but sometimes it's worth the splurge, especially if you get to sit on the balcony on a nice evening. I have yet to hit up their happy hour but will definitely come back soon!"

But once you get in, immediately you experience the intended vibe.  \n\nThe menus look like notebooks and there is appropriate memorabilia filling the walls to give off that public school atmosphere.  They have a very good craft beer list, including main stays and rotating options that they write on a chalkboard at the entrance.  The beers are towards the expensive side ($7-$9), but they offer rare varieties and local brews so it is worth it in some cases.\n\nThe food was surprisingly above average.  This is why I look at this restaurant as a high class pub.  The food wasn't just bangers and mash or fish and chips.  I had a quinoa salad which was both large and delicious.  Another member of my party had a lamb burger, and another a kale salad.  We also shared a nice looking watermelon tower of a salad.\n\nOverall the food is great, the beer selection is great, the Happy Hour is supposedly great (food specials and $1 off beers) and the location is great.  Try this place if you're looking for a better Yard House."

My wife took all the cocktail napkins on the table to soak up the oil and they were all soaked. \nI ordered the huntsman burger which our server recommended I order medium.  I opted for medium rare ( my personal preference).  Burger came out medium.  A bit disappointed but not a  deal killer.\n\nSome minor hiccups and I will probably give them another shot but if it's still mediocre that may be the last time.

Our party of 8 was seated promptly but it was 15 minutes before our server approached and took drink orders. 15 minutes later, (most of) our drink orders arrived (since they were out of what I ordered, I had to wait another 5 minutes).  The menu had some interesting items but was overall meh, and food took forever to arrive. Some in our party commented on the plates that had been sitting under the heat lamps forever, turns out, it was ours. Fish and chips sat easily for 20 minutes so the fries were soggy as one could imagine. My buddy asked for more ketchup, never arrived. We ordered an extra round of drinks and after 10 minutes, same friend went out to the bar to get them himself. While there, he ran into our server, which was a little awkward, and the server commented about the drinks, and ended up bringing the round we ordered anyway, so now we have an extra round on our table getting warm. At least we won't have to wait for the next round to arrive.  \nBottom line:  With all the options in Downtown Summerlin, a restaurant really needs to bring its A game. The soggy food and REALLY bad service makes me regret suggesting it for our monthly get together. We won't be back."

Again, I usually don't write a review after 1 visit.. but we were pretty unhappy when we left. \n\nIt started with arriving at 10 pm after being told that the menu goes until 1 am. Not so.. late night menu started at 10 pm appearantly. There was a pretty mediocre selection of food at that point, but we figured we drove all the way out there so we would give it a try. This was after we were given the full menu. But here's how it all went.. \n\nWe ordered drinks and found seats at the bar. Sat in front of a bartender that cleaned her well for literally 15 minutes without even looking up. Like, literally a foot from my face. Nothin. So my friend says, \"what time do you close?\" \n\nShe says - \"it's different every day,\" and she went back to cleaning. My other buddy says, \"but we can still order food right?\" She says nothing, hands us late night menus, and a full menu and continues cleaning. Without any other explanation. So we waited patiently as she polished the grate for the well, wiped it down and then walked away. it was bewildering. \n\nMy buddy had to ask another bartender that was passing by if we could order. The bartender said, \"well what time is it?\" \n\nLOL! I said i's about 1030.. he said \"ooooh let me check...\" he says. \n\nHe gave us a thumbs up from the other end of the bar but did not return to take the order. So when he came to our end of the bar again - about 5 minutes later to pour a draft beer, my buddy just started ordering out loud. haha.. I mean we had no intention of being rude.. but we were trying way too hard to order, like no-one was interested in serving us. We all had all worked and were there to eat. Very hungry. There were 3 bartenders, and literally 9 people at the bar.. we were the only ones trying to eat, and just could not get service. \n\nSo now I'm watching the original female bartender that was cleaning her bar well in front of us. She grabs a glass water bottle.. drinks from it, then grabs a bottle of what appeared to be lemon juice from the bar well - and we all watched as she poured lemon juice into her water bottle. She did this by touching the mouth of the lemon juice bottle to the mouth of the bottle she just drank from, then put the juice bottle back in the well. I'm in no way squeemish, though that's just kind of gross, not to mention just wrong. \n\nSo far - wtf. \n\nSo the food.. we finally had a chance to order and were told only the late night menu was available.. after all that  time..we made some decisions and were informed we couldn't order them. This is were an explanation when dropping the menus would have been helpful. \n\nSo we ordered Calamari, flavor was ok, not crispy AT ALL despite being fried.. I mean, literally soggy. Naked wings, all flats, no drums, which was weird but they were crispy and good.. deviled eggs.. good.. but the presentation were those of eggs that had been prepared and set out for a few minutes because the yolks were not looking so fresh, also we ordered truffle fries. The fries SUCKED. Seriously. Luke-warm, soggy, and served with preserved lemon aioli? I didn't understand that, I liked the aioli but not with these fries (that's just me).. They did not get eaten, yet taken away by the bartender without question as to whether we were done or if there was some reason it was over 75% unfinished. So there's that.\n\nStill very hungry we decided on the FIG and Prosciutto Pizza and Taleggio and Mushroom pizza. I'm not even going to go into it becuase both were very sloppy in presentation and just mediocre in flavor overall. Honestly. We ate most of the Fig and Prosciutto and less than half of the Mushroom Taleggio. \n\nWhat I will say about he pizzas -  is that the female food runner that brought the food over, literally shoved my drink to the side as I was trying to move the dirty plates from the previous course out of the way, then quite obviously tossed both pizza plates onto the bar and walked away. I spun around like.. wtf? my buddies both just laughed because we were so just over it at this point. She looked miserable, and was taking it out on us! haha.. it's laughable in retrospect, but I mean really?! She then walked to the end of the bar by the service well and started chewing on her finger nails. No Joke. \n\nOk, so listen.. I am not trying to just be an angry diner about this.. but i'll say it again: There is absolutely no reason for medocire food, or service in a town like Las Vegas. There are too many choices where people actually want to do the right thing, and serve a quality product.\n\nThis experience was a fail, and we are all easy-going foodie kind of people. \n\nI have no intention to go back to PUBLIC SCHOOL 702, soley based on the service. I would have liked to try the regular menu, but this experience was just a bust for me. \n\nSorry - \n\nHappy Eating to you though!"

The food runners didn't know who ordered what, which is ok but then they didn't even know what the dish was called that they had. Know your menu. \n\nMusic was too loud to have a conversation unless you talked to the person next to you and you were leaning in.

The bacon tater tots were good as well as the buffalo cauliflower. Next came the margherita pizza. As our waitress was setting it on the table I noticed a bug crawling on it. I pointed it out to her right away. She looked at it and was visibly shaken, and said out loud \"oh, no\"! She immediately took the pizza back to the kitchen. \nNot really feeling like eating anything at this point we just asked for our bill. We only had the two appetizers.\nNext she came back with the manager who proceeded to blame the bug on the fact that they keep their doors open all night. I don't care if you are cooking in the middle of the jungle, food should not have bugs in it. \nAlthough we had plan to pay our bill, it would have been nice to have been offered to offset the bill, or offer a complimentary dessert, or something. The manager acted as if we were trying to take a shot, or something. We just feel like this situation could have been handled differently. \nSadly, we will most likely never go back there. We really liked the vibe.\nI would have only given this place one star, however our waitress, Julianne was a sweetheart."

            "review": "Labor Day. Expected it to be crowded, and it was. The great thing about Public School 702 is its size. Even while busy, like today, you can't tell it is because the tables are spread out nicely to not give the appearance that it's  bustling.\n\nI've been here a handful of times since its opening and have never been utterly disappointed with the food. It's just good bar food but does not blazea trail of culinary excellence or originality. Service always seems to start off a little slow but due to team service model, once the order is in, food and drink get out at a good clip.\n\nThat being said, this is a review for weekend  brunch service. The brunch menu is more interesting that the regular menu, and we enjoyed it much more. Flavors were bold and serving sizes were huge.  We had the jidori chicken and green chili cornbread waffles and the chicken sausage with cheese grits. The chicken and waffles was one of the better interpretations of this classic dish. The waffle was more savory, and the slight heat from the green chili offset some of the heaviness of the dish. The chicken sausage and grits were good and plentiful stuffed with wilted kale, cherry tomatoes, and topped with an over easy egg. The menu didn't indicate that it would be spicy but there was definitely some heat in the vegetable mixture, which I appreciated.  Paired with the grits, it was a very filling meal. I would've appreciated a biscuit or some piece of bread to sop up some sauce, but then again, I may have had to wear a biscuit since I was so full.\n\nFor those with kids, this is a good place to eat some grown up food and appease some kids' boring palates. They have a kids menu with the standards - mac and cheese, pizza, chicken, cheese burger sliders, etc. Portions are large (a couple of young kids could share a pizza) but it's not the cheapest kids' meals either. Noise level isn't too much of a concern because there's always a game of shuffle board where the banging of the pucks sound like large wood planks slamming against each other. \n\nIt's a good choice for the whole family and especially if you're walking around DT Summerlin. Cool inside dining and if eating outdoors is your thing, they have a nice patio, but most of the view is parking lot and a little of the water feature at the north end of the mall."

Music is not good, not cozy I guess! The food is ok, calamari was too salty, the meatballs were not so good with linguine, we were told it's spicy and we said it's ok but the flavoring and the consistency of food does not go well with too much spicy. Cute coke in a bottle drink, fried chicken waffles were OK, I've tasted better! Dessert is ordinary and simple. So all in all nothing to look forward to, I don't even like beers and most of their alcoholic drinks are beer and wine, I wish they have fruity mixed drinks as an option!! I gave 2 stars for location. Will probably not go back here until they upgrade their menu and music"

I have been here multiple times with my boyfriend and decided to bring my best friend here to try it. \n\nFirst, the hostess. She was opening the door for some middle aged women ahead of us. She continued to hold the door for my party of three but then stated,\" how can I help you?\". I really wanted to respond with \"well, this is a restaurant soooooo.....\" But I decided not to and told her how many where in our party. She then said she had to help the people ahead and would be with us in a minute. When it was our turn she asked if we wanted to bar or dining area. I chose bar because I knew it was going to be the tail end of happy hour and we would be able to throw our order in quick before it was over. The hostess said \"sure, go on ahead\". So I say myself. I honestly couldn't tell you if she actually walked behind us or how the menus got on the table. I just know I turned around and menus were there but the hostess was gone. We never received the usual \"your server will be with you in a minute\". This is where the next thing comes in. \n\nSecond, the server. I have family that is servers and they immediately greet people that come to their table within 1 minute. I had sat at the table, my boyfriend went to the bathroom and returned and I still sat there and waited. It got to the point where I was actually looking around wondering when I was going to see who the server was. Kaila finally came to the table with waters, never said her name. Just asked if we wanted anything to drink or appetizers and if we had been there before. I told her two of us had and it was my friends first time. I asked her if they still had Happy Hour going on and she said \"no, it's 3:30 to 6:30\" and then asked my friend what time it was. My friend looked at her phone and went \"it's 6:30 on the dot.\" And Kaila went \"oh yeah you missed it\". I can honestly say this was the first time I had been somewhere where it was close to happy hour and the server didn't offer to \"hurry and rush the order in\" so that we would still get the happy hour specials. Not to mention the fact that if we hadn't been waiting for our server to greet us, we would have made it in time for Happy Hour. We all ordered our drinks and as I was going to order appetizer she walked away. When she returned with our beers. She had poured my boyfriends but gave me the bottle of Delirium and an empty glass and said \"in case you want a glass.\" I know that may seem minor but usually servers ask if you want in poured in a glass and this was the very first time I had ever not had delirium poured in a glass and served in a bottle. I'm not fancy or stuck up, but come on. Next we ordered our appetizers. We got three different items and no plates. We literally sat there for 5 minutes waiting for plates. After maybe 15 minutes the Kaila came over and asked if we wanted anything else or not. I told here we were going to get some entrees in a bit. She said okay and left. She came later and took our dinner orders and seemed more pleasant. I'm fairly certain it was only because she saw me checking in on YELP. \n\nWe were so disappointed with the service that we don't think we will be back. Which is disappointing, we really liked it. I'm not sure if because we were dressed casual and not all dolled up like the Summerlin housewives of hipsters out on dates they thought we were cheap or what. But we all make a very good living and have family that are servers so we always tip 20%, if not more and were repeat customers. But sadly I think that's changed."

Slow and indifferent wait staff, undercooked food, and frigid  ambient air.  Make sure to bring a Parka as management likes to keep the temp to the point that you can see your breath.  In addition, if you are so lucky to be placed at the tables with the uncomfortable aluminum chairs, you get that extra chill literally to the seat of your pants.  \n\nService has been very slow last 2 visits, even when they aren't busy and my impression is that this restaurant already has outgrew it's \"new coolness\", but for some reason continued to feel that they are special and thus not open to suggestions, My impression is upper management likely feel customers will continue to return no matter the experience and this feels to me very reminiscent of the restaurants of the 80s who felt big and bad, refused to change, and thus are nothing but a memory on the internet search pages under \"top ten 80's chain restaurants that failed in the 80s\" Nothing has changed between our 2nd and 3rd visits (spaced about 4 months apart) and that usually means nothing will.  \n\nI unfortunately will not recommend The Public House to anyone who lives in or is visiting Vegas, as there are many better options with staff that care about you and do not act like they are the \"in thing\", and that you are lucky to be sitting there, as well as food that taste better with a better price.  The menu tries to be original in choices but comes off being bland and flavorless.  \n\nI always give a place 3 chances and this one unfortunately will not get a 4th.

Had the watermelon and tomato salad which was delicious and refreshing and also the white bean breakfast toast which was amazing!!! Our server Sean was great and brought me my next drink without even asking for it. Overall an exceptional experience and I can't wait to come back.

The only con for the patio seating during brunch is the sun can shine directly at you but what can ya do?! \n\nOur server was really sweet though it took her some time to get to our table... She answered all questions and gave us her recommendations.\nThe food was just ok. We shared chicken and waffles and a healthy egg scramble. The chicken was bone in and the gravy was thick. The scramble had lots of veggies. \n\nWe also got the bottomless bubbles but their \"bottomless\" certainly has a bottom as it is 4 drinks per guest. You can get a carafe of mimosa and that constitutes as 3 drinks and then you can get a bloody. The Bloody Mary was way too thick and spicy. I wouldn't get it. It doesn't go down that well after eating and didn't satisfy my Bloody Mary craving. You can also get a bloody beer/Michelada. \n\nWe may be back for the outdoor seating. The prices are not that bad. BTW, love the school theme on the napkins and menus!\n\nHOT TIP: Recess/Happy Hour at the bar. Mon-Fri 3:30-6:30. Discounts on brews, wines, & bites!"

To start with, there were two host persons at the door, a girl and a boy, (11/21/2015 around 6:30PM). We entered and had to stand behind them for like 2 minutes because the they were seem to be having their own conversations! As a valued customer to the restaurant should I disturb their little private conversations?? NO!!! finally the girl acknowledged that we are standing behind them and she said there is a wait for 25 minutes! And guess what?? We could see from where we are standing that there are so many seats available at the bar, where they fully serve all the menu items!!! And she didn't even bother to suggest that!!! Wow!! Felt like she think \"we don't want to be too busy\"!!!  And since we know we can sit at the bar, we went there and sat. I ordered two appetizers, two entrees and two cocktails as usual! My pasta was cold, but I sent back to warm it up. During this time someone took away all the utensils assuming that I am done eating, therefore I had to wait another few minutes get new utensils again! And we wish they didn't put too much BBQ sauce on the bison burger! Very disappointed really!!!"

We ordered drinks and an appetizer (deviled eggs, they were very good). We had finished our drinks and appetizer and were sitting there holding our menus wanting to order food. She walked past us several times without stopping to ask if we wanted to order. We finally flagged her down and she said \"oh, I thought you already ordered, I guess that was a different table\". \nWe ordered the Huntsman burger and the Bison burger, both were pretty good. When our food came out we asked for a side of dressing, which we never got. Our food was delivered by a runner and our server never checked back in to see of everything was ok. \nAlso, don't order soda, it's a rip off.

Loved how it was topped with salt and vinegar potato chips. That way yummy. I kept going back for more! I had the short ribs which was very tender just not enough flavor for me. I needed salt. Nutella cookie was good but I prefer soft gooey cookies, this one was a little hard. My husband said you could ask them to warm it up. \n\nNext visit I do want to try the shrimp pasta, bison burger and lemon dessert :)\n\nI did also find it strange that reservations over 6 need manager approval. I never got a callback to confirm. Luckily plans changed and it was just a party of four so I was able to reserve on line.  Service was good once we got there.

It was a slow night so if a restaurant doesn't know serving 101, clean your tables after the guests leave there was no way we trusted the rest of the cleanliness. We sat for 5 mins and still no one cared to wipe/sanitize the tables. The back of the house must be filthy if that is the standard of the front of the house. Again, slow night, employees just standing around. We walked out. Downtown Summerlin has a lot of restaurant options that I'm sure sanitize and clean up after their guests."

The restaurant is a large space with an enormous outdoor patio. Indoors the room has high ceilings and hard surfaces but was conversation friendly. \nAt check in we requested a booth and only waited a few minutes for one to be cleared. Service was prompt with our server offering water while we perused the menu.. Refreshments include bottomless Bloody Mary's and Mimosas. If you drink more than two it becomes a money saver. Review the large chalk board at the entrance if you are beer lover.\n\nWe chose the Ahi tuna Tacos as a starter. There are four to an order with avocado salsa, and lemon aioli served in crispy wonton shells. The Ahi Tuna was fresh and flavorful. The shells provided a nice crunch.\nChicken Sausage & Cheddar Grits are on the Brunch menu and come with two fried eggs, blistered tomatoes, grilled corn, bacon, greens and a beer sauce. The chicken sausage has a little heat and the entire dish is a nice mix that will fill you up. \nGrilled Salmon with Summer Succotash is on the regular menu. Our server did not ask the degree of doneness for the salmon, however it was prepared to my satisfaction, cooked all the way through with nice grill marks. The salmon is served with roasted  vegetables, edamame, corn, squash and citrus butter.\nPublic School 702 has a Happy Hour in the bar and extends to part of the patio. Since the patio faces east I would recommend it for when the sun move across the roof and adds some shade. Ceiling fans help with the circulation. The beer menu has a wide variety of choices. \nA return visit is a must to further explore the offerings."

However, the presentation on the food was amazing. This is a fun place to go with friends for lunch dates!"

I ordered the Moody Burger and it was NOT good at all. \nThe horseradish aioli is way too overpowering and instantly gives you bad breath, I had to take my bun off just to eat the burger. My burger tasted like charcoal too. The fries were yummy though. \nMy boyfriend ordered the Eggs Benedict pizza. SALTYYYY so much salt, it needed like tomatoes or avocado or something to dull out the salt. \nThe beer selection was decent. Sad they got rid of the Dawn of the Red beer. \nIt wasn't very good, I may try it again someday but odds are I won't. \nService was slow but the servers were nice...\nThis place is too expensive for what you're getting.

The drinks were in my opinion overpriced.. this isn't the strip, it's freakin Summerlin.. why do we have to price gouge the locals? My Jack Daniels and water was somewhere around $20. Come on! \n\nMy grilled salmon was absolutely delicious. It was $21 but it was worth it. My friends enjoyed the deviled egg appetizers and tater tots.

From appetizers to the entries everything was room temperature to warm, like the food was made and sat around. Some of the dishes severely lacked basic seasoning in the form of salt and pepper, and chicken in the salad tasted like it was cooked(overcooked) the day before, then shredded for use the next day. Kids chicken finger was fried for longer than needed. We were seated near the kitchen and I could tell that there was no one in control of the food coming out of the kitchen, very undisciplined. Been there before and the food was much better months ago before the started changing some of the plating of the food. No complaints on the bar side or service side. They did recognize some of the faults of the kitchen and took it off our bill and gave us a dessert to share"

You can tell that they are trying to bring different flavor and style to their menu. The wings tasted like fried chicken and side note - they don't have ranch.

The ahi poke was decent with the passion fruit sauce in there but the fish didn't taste fresh. Now on to the entree. I got fish and chips and wow, the inside was less barely warm and there was wayyyy too much batter. I ended up just eating the fish on the inside and left out the batter. Fries could be crispier. They were too soggy in my opinion. Definitely ask for the bbq honey sauce to dip your fries in. All in all, I would come back here just for drinks and maybe some bar food during happy hour.

It's a \"Make Friends\" atmosphere which grew on us. \n\nThe pizza was our least favorite & luckily it was also last. Not quite sure if it's simply because it paled in comparison to everything ahead of it. PB&J sliders are a must! That habanero jam MAKES it! Chorizo Mac n Cheese was good the vinegar crunch was the best touch. The texture of the chorizo set it off a bit... tough & chewy. Not sure if that was just ours or how it is, but good enough to go back and try again!\n\nWe also had the Dawn of the Red by Ninkasi Brewing Co - slight hints of pineapple, mango, and papaya.

Creamy, savory, yummy, goodness. Scrape the bottom of the plate goodness. Also excellent value. I'd just get this as  meal.\n-Bacon Tater Tots: 5/5 Also very yummy. crispy on the out side buttery flaky on the inside. SO GOOD.\n-Speck & Eggs: 3/5 Good but not out of the ordinary.\n-Fried Jidori Chicken and Green Chili Cornbread Waffles: 5/5 Delicious chicken, perfectly seasoned, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Waffle was maybe not the typical texture but you have to remember it's cornbread. Still very good. Also, HUGE portion.\n-Stuffed French Toast: 5/5 Very good. Sweet but not overly sweet.\n-Shrimp and Grits: 5/5 Perhaps the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. the grits didn't come in a bowl of mush, but rather in something like a grit cake--a little crunch on the outside and creamy on the inside. \n-Almost bottomless Mimosa: 2/5 it's fine but mimosa is a mimosa. Nothing special. and definitely loses out to the bloody mary.\n-Almost bottomless bloody mary: 10/5 OMG. it came with a pickled garlic and a...chicken wing. NO JOKE. Solid spicy kick, and not too sweet. I swear next time I'm just coming to get bottomless bloody mary. That's 4 bloody marys and 4 chicken wings. for $10. What more can you ask for in a brunch?

My wife had the crushed velvet drink and loved it.  The reason I only gave them 3 stars was due to the beer. They have a good selection but ran out of two of their Wheat beers.  I tried 3 others. They were all very hop heavy in taste.  The first one was a witber, which should be smooth but had a strong after taste. I drank about half and told the server it was very hoppy and asked if they had anything smoother.  He brought me another brand. Not as hoppy but still had a stronger taste.  Not comparable to the brand I described to him. I was able to finish it. I tried one more brand but still had a strong finish.  My guess is the brands they were out of were the ones that were less harsh.  The server didn't seem very knowledgable about the brands that they serve. If you like IPA's this is your place.  If you like beer like Smithwicks, Newcastle, Leinenkugel, Stella and smoother domestics, I would not recommend going here for a beer.  Great vibe though. We will go back if friends pick the place. Don't see us choosing this as our DTS spot."

Let me start this review by saying we really tried to love this place. We have gone at least 10 times ( all for the love of craft beer).\n\nPROS: Atmosphere is very cool. And of course the #1 reason anyone should go there is for the rotating tap. The managers have tried to make our experiences a little better by sending out a few comped meals, very much appreciated but tasteless.\n\nCONS: Food is nothing special. We have had everything on the happy hour menu +. The only thing worth eating our the chicken sausage, which they have been out of the last 3 times I tried to give this place another attempt. You get a very small portion of chicken sausage for too high of a price for happy hour. And they are only available on happy hour boo (thumbs down) Everything else on the menu is really really uneventful. \nBartenders are not very knowledgeable about the beer which is just plain saddening. \n\nLet me share our brunch experience. The mimosas are a joke. If u want good bottomless mimosas I suggest Echo and Rig and DW Bistro. The mimosas at 702 come premixed for u, which is ridiculous I'm an adult and will choose how much champagne I would like in my mimosa thank you. When asked if we could have our OJ on the side the answer was no. When we went to order our waitress told us those particular items would not be ready to order for a 45 mins.. um excuse me? So we waited and 45 mins to put in on order and another 40 to get our food, which of course was tasteless. Brunch was a complete joke and the waitress wasn't anything special either. \n\nIf we return it will be for beer only. That's all they got going for them. So sad."

They also kept sounding off a loud horn which was quite annoying.  The ambiance does not reflect the restuarants name; Public School, it seems more like a loud bar with a sub par disconnected menu.\n2) We ordered Salmon with  vegetables and steak salad...The salmon was delicious, but the vegetables tasted like dish soap and the lettuce served with the 4 pieces of thinly sliced steak looked and tasted like day old bag lettuce...a little salt and pepper would have been nice to enhance some flavor, but our server never returned until we were done with our meal.\n3) We ordered 3 glasses of wine, 1 califlower appetizer, 1 Steak Salad, and 1 Salmon with vegetables..approximately $95.00.  They did take $11.00 off for the dish soap veggies, but the service was challenging and for paying almost $100.00 it was very disappointing.  It's so unfortunate since it is a great location."

There's memorabilia all over the restaurant from generations of different schools. The bar area is reminiscent of a gymnasium with bleachers and a scoreboard. There's also shuffleboard, beer pong, and extremely large Jenga. Right off the bat, I was impressed.\n\nWe were greeted promptly by our server, Jared Smith. He gave us a tour of the menu and went over the craft beer list. There are about 40 of them! He recommended the crushed velvet for me, as I'm not much of a beer drinker, and the tenaya brown for my husband, who is. The crushed velvet was delicious! It's like a blackberry Moscow mule. Next we ordered the mezze plate and the crispy cauliflower, based on Jared's recommendations, and both were delicious.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the salmon with succotash and my husband had the fried chicken and waffles, also Jared's recommendations. The salmon was fresh and paired delightfully with the succotash. The combination of the crushed velvet and the salmon was so good I had to order another one. My husband raved about his dish so of course I tried it, and yes it was delicious. A bit too many calories for me, but if that's no concern to you (and it's not too my husband), then this is the dish for you!\n\nAll in all it was a great experience and the bill was extremely reasonable. The atmosphere is light and fun, and the food and beverage are delightful. I was very impressed with Jared and his recommendations. We loved everything he picked, and he made the experience even more enjoyable. Public school - we will definitely be back!"

We wanted an outside table and were told there was a 15 minute wait and they would text us when the table was ready. They finally texted us around 20 minutes later and we were seated outside. At first, the hostess tried to seat us at the only table with a broken fan when it was over 100 degrees outside! After bringing that to her attention we were seated at a table with a working fan.\n\nWe sat at the table for 20 minutes. No one came to take our drink orders. No one asked us if we needed help. One waitress made eye contact with me 3 times and didn't say anything. \n\nWe ended up leaving and going to Wolfgang Puck next door which was excellent by the way.\n\nI would not recommend this place based on the non-existent service."

Bison burger was good, though my medium came to me closer to rare. Wife said her steak salad was good. Beer and cocktail menu are very good. \n\nService was so-so. We had reservations, but still got seated in one of the worst tables in the house right by the main entrance. Uncomfortable metal chairs, wobbly table. \nAlso, our main courses were served 5 minutes after they dropped our appetizers. Hate that. \n\nAmbience is PS 702's real weakness. This place is cavernous, uninspired in its decor, bizarre in its traffic flow, and ridiculously, jarringly, loud. I mean, can't-hear-the-people-at-your-own-table-loud. Punctuated by unexplained buzzer alarms like you might hear just before the nuclear meltdown.\n\nI'm glad we gave it a try, but doubt I'll be back. Although the food was pretty good, the environment made me feel I was rushing through a meal at a theme park food plaza. Not for everyone, I suppose."

I tried everything and then my mother started to help and still nothing would work. We went outside at the patio just so we wouldn't interrupt other customers inside the restaurant. Few minutes later, a tall gentleman with a mustache who probably work in the kitchen area came outside with frozen blueberries.

I went with my husband around dinner time on a Friday and we only had to wait 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. \n\nThe first thing you notice when you walk in is how unbelievably loud it is.  It was so loud the hostess was having difficulty communicating where to seat people.  They walked a little ways in, and it started to get quieter, but then we were seated directly under a blaring speaker.  We still managed to get in some dinner conversation, but it did detract from the experience overall.\n\nWe ordered the chorizo mac and cheese as an appetizer.  It came practically within a minute of ordering it, which was great for timing, but it also means it was already prepared and waiting for us to order it. I'm not even sure they had to mix it based on how fast it came. The mac and cheese alone was actually pretty boring.  Adding the potato chips gave it a crunch and depth of flavor that helped.  The chorizo was pretty standard, nothing spectacular.  If you managed to get all four things on your fork at the same time it was good, but not great.  \n\nBecause the appetizer was out so quickly, we waited about 15 minutes for entrees after the appetizer was finished.  My husband had the steak salad for his entree.  It was supposed to have a white truffle vinaigrette on it.  He assured me that it did lightly taste of truffle, but honestly I couldn't taste it myself.  Perhaps my flavor palette is off.  The salad overall was tasty and had a bunch of different things mixed in.  We ordered the steak med-rare and it came med-well, but it was still delicious.\n\nI ordered the stout braised ribs as my entree and it was fantastic.  The ribs fell apart as soon as you put your fork to them, the gravy was so flavorful, and it was all served on top of yukon gold mashed potatoes.  It was absolutely wonderful.\n\nWhen the bill came it was over $60 which I think wasn't consistent with the experience I had there.  At those prices, I will head next door to Fogo when it opens for lunch.  I may go back to try out \"recess\" which is their happy hour, but I will not be returning for dinner."

I told the hostess to remove our name, and she asked what our name was and removed it.\nService tip, the front door is the first experience the guests have when you walk into a restaurant.  Acknowledge your guests, keep better track of who has been seated and who hasn't, especially guests that are in front of your face for 40 minutes, advise guests of a longer wait time on a Friday night.  If they get seated earlier, bonus for your team!  If someone removes their name from the wait, have your hostess ask if there was an issue, offer an apology (after watching us wait!), say something!  Growing pains - i'm sure.\nWe won't be back, nor will we suggest to our friends and family."

She leaves to put in our order then returns about 10 minutes later and asks how everything is going and if we were ready to order food.

She then is walking around almost looking like she was trying to be busy but not really doing anything. Our food showed up mine with a bun on it that I asked not to have. I just took it off.

We ordered a bunch of apps and all split them. The bacon tatortots were great really crispy and still softer potato center great onion bacon flavor we also had the truffle fries they were the shoe string type great flavor also delicious we got the sliders and a margarita pizza the sliders were really tasty classic slider nothing fancy but they nailed it and the pizza was good too simple fresh ingredients . The bartenders here are real deal they have great drinks and I should have know from the in house made tonic that they could make just about anything . My wife knowing that I am a fan of the classic cocktail the Negroni asked our bartender if she could make one and without hesitation she said sure and it was great ! And topped with a dried cherry garnish !"

The experiences have been stellar with an awesome gregarious, engaging crew up until tonight. All it takes is one egregious experience to ruin it all. Never, and I emphatically stress NEVER get served by the bartender Lisa. I'm an industry professional so I've experienced both sides of the bar. I know everyone is entitled to a bad day but, this one \"she's special.\"\nWalk up to the bar, have a seat and have this bartender directly in front of you for a solid two minutes and see if she even acknowledges your existence. Where I sat was at the ice and the mixing station so she was 22-inches away from me. It took the bar back to approach  me and asked if I wanted the menu. Finally,  Grumpy looked at me and asked if I wanted to place an order. My reply, \"Would you please fire up a Brick Chicken.\" She looked at me like I was an alien (the outer space kind). She looked so puzzled, I repeated the order by saying, \"The Jidori Brick Chicken?\" and pointing to the menu. You know what her response was? You know when someone has that look that they can't be bothered. It was that, with this reply, \"Are you getting a drink?!\" I was speachless because, last I checked, I'd rather get tipped for a $25 dinner than an $8 beer. She looked absolutely perturbed as if how dare me order food before a cocktail. I'm most likely going to retract this review after a few months just to make sure this establishment stays in check and not to cocky with their success. I wanted to twist the knife just a tad. I tipped my server when I moved to a table 55%. :-)"

The mall was completely dead and we quickly realized everyone was in this restaurant!  It was happy hour time, but I had my 3-year-old with me so we couldn't order off of that menu since HH is only for the bar, obviously.\n\nBuffalo cauliflower: yum!  I normally hate mayo-based sauces, but this had so much blue cheese in it that I kept dunking.\n\nGrilled watermelon & tomato salad (more like a stack):  my favorite thing.  Very refreshing and flavorful with some sort of white cheese (it looked in the shape of white chocolate shavings...tasted like feta sort of, but can't confirm because the shape of the cheese shards confused me but they were good).  Plus balsamic and oil drizzle.  Loved this!\n\nChicken & waffles:  the waffle is chile cornbread!  Very yummy.  It said there was syrup on it, but I couldn't tell because the chicken was saucy and the cornbread was savory.  It was good, but I felt it needed more sweet syrup to give it a true chicken & waffles experience.\n\nWe almost got the fish & chips, but decided against it because my kid wanted it and it was on the kids menu.  We thought we could just try a bite of hers.  When the kids' meal came out, it was a ridiculously large bowl of fries, with 3 small pieces of the best fried cod I have ever had.  The texture of the coating was insane, and the inside fish was still perfectly cooked (I hate when it dries out and is over cooked).  We took one of my daughter's pieces and my daughter ate the other two.  She hardly ate any fries.  Then, she wanted more fish.  GREAT.  It was $8 for her meal, and I had to order more fish for her...but this time I said no fries regardless that I had to pay $8 again because it was just a waste!  \n\nOther than being annoyed at spending $16 for my daughter to have enough fish & chips (our fault for taking one of her pieces), everything was great.  Very filling, indulgent meal.  Not expensive either.\n\nOh, and the service is great!  At least our experience.  Our server was a tad slow but it was busy in there so he had a bunch of tables I'm sure.  But even the servers who weren't ours were super friendly!  My daughter kept playing peek-a-boo with them since we were near the order-entry computer station, and every single one of the servers gave her attention and talked to her.  Very cool, I was impressed."

            "review": "Public School 702 has the type of refined brand you'd expect from a chain restaurant, which it is, but manages to feel more like a small-scale, chef-driven spot thanks to a modern menu and great craft brews. As a gastropub, you'll find pub and bar fare that will hit the spot like bangers and mash consisting of snappy chicken and herb sausages and a hearty bacon brussels mash. Other top dishes include chicken wings with a crackly, crispy exterior; the adobo tacos that come with two roasted chicken and two short rib tacos; and the massive farro and brussels salad with pan seared scallops.\n\nThey serve brunch on weekends, too. Their French toast varies, but the blackberry lemon curd version I tried was equally sweet and tart. Even better was the fried jidori chicken and green chili cornbread waffles. Well seasoned with a thin, crispy crust, the chicken sat atop mildly spiced, savory waffles covered in a gravy full of bacon bits. Topped with a fried egg, the brunch version differs from the one on their regular menu which has more chicken and no egg.\n\nUnfortunately, some dishes fall flat. I wasn't a fan of the broccoli or salt and vinegar chips in the mac and cheese. And, the grits in the shrimp and white cheddar grits dish was too soupy and runny for my liking.\n\nTheir beer list changes frequently, but they've had some great ones on the menu like Jommegang by Ommegang (a Belgian style dark ale) and Parabloa by Firestone Walker (a Russian imperial stout).\n\nService has been solid the few times I've gone, but the restaurant is so large, with a long rectangular layout, that you can see servers struggling to race to the bar to pick up drinks, race to the kitchen on the other end to grab food, and race back to the tables. I think all the servers act as food runners and bussers too so the amount of work they have to do isn't conducive to great customer service. It's an issue with management and the layout more than anything, but often reflects poorly on the servers."

Unfortunately we were too early for RECESS (love that)/happy hour.\n\nInterior: very cute motif, loved the menu! \n\nWaiter: didn't catch his name but he had a ponytail and glasses, haha, but he was awesome! \nOne thing though, although I LOVE the ketchup and sriracha dip that came with my food, he should have asked if I wanted regular ketchup or the ketchup & siracha, you know, just in case ppl wouldn't like the combination (but I mean... It's siracha! Jk... Maybe that's why he didn't ask..who'd reject such a thing!?) \n\nWhen I told him he should hook it up on more sauce, he did AND suggested a bbq mustard sauce that would go with my food but I thought it tasted better with my brother's pizza, but I appreciated his incentive.\n\nFood: I got the Colorado Lamb Burger medium rare, omg. It melted in mouth. I thought it was delicious! Loved the savory from the lamb and the sweetness from the jam together. \n\nMy brother got the pizza which I thought was okay. \n\nA friend got tortilla soup and sliders, didn't get to try the sliders but it looked dry and she said it was ok. I got a taste of the tortilla soup and the flavor was light where I've had tortilla soup blasting with flavors, I mean, it wasn't bad, but just not what I'm used to? \n\nPro: They have dishes with kale, quino, and cauliflower, and other things if you're feeling something more healthier? I 'preciate that too :). \n+ they have a children's menu\n\nCon: I kind of wish there were more selections for nonalcoholic drinks though, but I understand that it's more of a pub kind of thing, but I was craving strawberry lemonade or other fruity, carbonated drinks. I mean, since they do serve burgers, maybe shakes? Haha."

I love to go to happy hour and have drinks and then order food towards the end. We did not even order food because the service was so dang slow that getting a drink was near to impossible. The female bartender at the bar, Courtney, told me she was going to charge my Bill. She did, and she never gave us the drinks we were charged for. The people on my right ordered an appetizer and they were incorrectly charged - they were charged higher than the pricing on the menu. When they said something to Courtney she said \"oh the menu prices have changed. \" so shouldn't that mean that the menu prices on the menu should have changed? The person on the left ordered something off the menu and Courtney said, \"we don't have that anymore.\" Didn't they just open? So how could you have something on the menu that they no longer even serve? How could there be three different sets of people sitting at the bar all given wrong prices and wrong orders!?. Happy hour beers are small. I can't comment on the food since we never ordered it because we knew it would take too long to get it. We went somewhere else to eat.  This place is never going to make it if they don't get their stuff together."

My server Colby (like the cheese, lol) was very knowledgable about the food and drinks and sold me a Dawn of the Red brew that I really loved while I chowed down on ahi wanton tacos--also delicious. I would have never considered putting ahi in a crispy wonton but it was magic. Despite the fact that I'm a beer loyalist, they had such an interesting selection of craft cocktails I had to indulge while I was finishing up my meal. Colby said that the crushed velvet was very popular so I gave it a try. Nice refreshing take on a Moscow mule. The fresh lavender was nice touch. I can't wait to go back and work my way through their great tap selection, and I'll definitely ask for Colby's section because I've never had such great service at a casual concept."

We started with the speck and eggs and the bacon cheddar tots with sriracha ketchup. Both were good. The speck and eggs didn't have a lot of flavor so I found myself dipping a lot. Then we moved on to lunch I got the green chili soup of the day it was amazing a little spicy but we'll made. My husband got the American burger which does not come with cheese heads up! An American burger with no cheese WHAT!?!? So he added American cheese go figure :) my sons shared a kids cheese pizza and let me tell you it was huge. So parents if you want to save a little money since the restaurant is pricey order 1 kids cheese pizza for all the kids it really is that big!!! \n\n I gave a 4 star review instead of a 5 for a couple of reasons. One my husband is a soda drinker and it is not complimentary refills! He was not happy about that! They only have bottled soda! That just isn't right especially when they do have spicy foods! The second reason I took away a star is because the food took a while to come out and I mean 30 minutes! For a medium cooked burger, cheese pizza, and a cup of premade chili to take 30 minutes is just ridiculous. I feel like there is no excuse for that especially on a saturday for brunch when they should be properly staffed. Other then that the restaurant was great and our server was pleasant. We will be back my husband fell in love with the burger and skinny fries! \n\nLittle tip for all you craft beer lovers they have an epic list!"

Hubby's sandwich had a decent spicy flavor to it, but it was nothing special. Also tried ahi tuna tacos to start. The dressing was nice and tart, but I would prefer it on a salad, not to flavor ahi.

Didnt love seeing 2 sardines staring at me when they sat the salad in front of me, but I scooted them to the side.  It was a good amount of salad, but again not sure id order it again.  Id like to go back and try some other options....ill keep you posted."

I tried to eat it, sent it back just asking if they could put it on a for another minute.  All they did was burn the outside.  Great now i have a burnt steak thats raw in the middle.  I just didnt eat it or complain further.  When i asked for my check with a full uneatin steak there were no questions and my waitress decided to sit at the POS station playing grab ass with some guy who worked there kissing her neck and whispering in her ear while i sat there waiting to pay for my uneaten raw piece of meat.  It'll be awhile before i return.  Cauliflower app is good."

Cafeteria style seating indoors, but noisy (Grade B) and outside is a large patio with lots of space to enjoy(Grade A). But that's where it ends. Service was okay at best (Grade C) , yes they were polite and positive (Grade B). The kitchen slowed them down and what they served was nothing I would be proud to turn in (Grade D). Overall I'd give Public School a  grade of (C). To stand out in  Downtown Summerlin Pubic School needs to take some extra credit and study a little harder."

They have a huge version of connect 4 and Jenga along with beer pong. \nOn my last visit we tried the pbj burger sliders which were fairly good.

The outside sitting area is really chill and there were a ton of people having happy hour drinks. It took about 10 minutes to get a drink waiting at the bar. Bartenders just didn't seem to have any sense of urgency. Beer pong was fun, but you have to drink their house pilsner which is the worst. You have no option to change or upgrade/downgrade your beer. Because of that, we only played one game and high tailed it out to Red Rock for some gambling."

She was wonderful, right away she told us all about the place and pointed out some of her favorite options, which I'm always pleased with when it's not just the most expensive. Also, I liked that they have about 6 dishes that can be made vegetarian by request. \n\nWe started with the buffalo cauliflower, her suggestion, which was amazing and I am not a fan on cauliflower. It's served with a blue cheese aioli and Frank's red hot sauce on the side. It was a large portion for the two of us and I would get it again! \n\nAlso, we got the ahi tuna wonton tacos. They were good. Not amazing but good. I don't think I would get them again though since the cauliflower left such a big impression. \n\nFor dinner I got shrimp and grits with a beer-blanc sauce. It was perfect!!!! I would order this again. The shrimp are cut in half so it looks like you are getting more than what you think you are. I didn't mind this because I like cutting the shrimp in smaller pieces so that I get some in every bite. The lady sitting next to me ordered this and she recommended it but said it was a bit to spicy for her. I enjoyed the bit of heat the dish had and didn't feel that it was all the spicy. I enjoyed just smashing and mixing everything together so that I would get a little of everything in every bite. The portion was large enough for me to take some for lunch tomorrow too which I liked. \n\nHusband got fried jidori chicken & green chili  cornbread waffles that had a bacon red eye gravy on the side. He ate it faster than I've ever seen him eat before! He LOVED it, he said the waffle was a nice savory accompaniment to the fried jidori chicken. I was able to sneak a bite the chicken was the most juiciest and moist chicken that I've had in a long time it was VERY delicious. It was the best tasting chicken I've had in a long time it was creamy yet firm, and had the best chicken flavor I've ever had! \n\n\nThe atmosphere was very hip with all types of decorations from a classroom. The ceiling over the bar looked like a gymnasium floor, they have beer pong, jenga, table shuffle board, and darts. The patio is beautiful, reminds you of a nice back yard with cool seating options. Each cabana like table has their own personal fan for the summer and heater for when it's cooler. They have A variety of seating options anywhere from two toppers to larger parties which I liked because it seems like you wouldn't have to wait as long for tables to get pushed together for parties of 6 or more and they had round tables for larger parties which I like.  \n\nThis will definitely be our new go to. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu, everything looked scrumptious."

And that is just what Public School 702 did.  They did a great job of managing our table, our requests, and our one food complaint (my friend was upset that he only got 4 shrimp in his shrimp and grits while I got around 10).\n\nI realllllllllly like the food here.  The Brussels sprouts/farro/scallop salad is so flavorful and light.  It is a huge portion to boot.  The shrimp and grits has a nice grill to it, and the cutting board is a good mix of meat and cheese.  I liked all of the apps except for the calamari, which was just so-so. \n\nI have tried three of the cocktails on the menu, and none of them were fantastic to me.  I was a little disappointed in their drink menu, but their full bar and nice selection of craft beers well makes up for it.\n\nThe space itself is such a cute theme with napkins that look like lined paper, to the menus that look like composition books, to the \"library\" wall inside the restaurant.  There is ample seating, a large patio, and even beer pong and Jenga for socializing.  Great spot for groups, a happy hour, or a date."

We told him that while it was regrettable that they were understaffed, that was the responsibility of his management to deal with  ultimately not our problem. He responded \"well, it's not my problem if things are a little slower than you'd like them to be.\"\n\nAt this point we were done.

He never appeared. \n\nThere are too many other options in the area for anyone to have to put up with such abysmal service."

Loved the balsamic reduction drizzled on top, but didn't love how hard the crust was. My sister said her tacos were great, and my dad enjoyed the fish& chips.

We got water in a container/bottle and in our 4 glasses.... the water was warm. Not sure who likes warm water but we don't so we asked for ice. We ordered our food which we didn't wait long for it to come out but we had no silverware or napkins. We waited for the waitress to come back with it but she didn't so we stopped someone else to ask for that. Our waitress was nice don't get me wrong just felt since it wasn't busy at all, the service, table & host should have been on top of their game. The 3 stars is for the experience we had. I would have gave it a 5 star because the food was awesome! We ordered the Mac and cheese, cutting board and a pepperoni pizza. The food was tasty.

The dining area is very loud, if you want to be able to hear each other sit outside.  The outside area is very nice, great view. There's misters and fans.  The music needs help, but I just blocked it out with good convo. \nThe service here is good, we didn't get utensils but they came after we asked. The guy seemed new to serving, which is fine, we got the right order and drinks were filled.  \nThe food was pretty good, not slammin, but delicious. We had the tater tots and chorizo mac and cheese to start.  The tater tots were very greasy, hardly any crunch and lacked the bacon flavor they were supposed to have. They missed the mark on that one, but the idea was good, if they could execute it they would be great. The tots just fell apart and were mushy. \nThe Mac and cheese had a sausage chorizo, and had big kettle chips on top.  It was cheesy but I love that crunchy bread crumb topping on mac and cheese, and it didn't have it, the chips just fell off and were useless. I wished they also used ground chorizo, that stuff is excellent when mixed with gooey cheese.  \nFor the main courses we had the Shrimp and cheddar grits, this was really good.  Great sauce, it was light, and the grit patty had a nice crunch to it.  They did that right, awesome. \nWe also had the short ribs.  They were a bit fatty, but the meat was very tender and great flavor. It reminded me of a meal you'd have at home on a holiday.  The mashed potatoes were sitting in a nice gravy, and they give you plenty of meat.  They also put some crispy brussell sprout chips on top.  They were really good.  Nice and salty with a slight char. \nAll in all it was pretty good, they have some kinks to work out, but it's a great place to eat outside and have drinks and food. If they play some good music it'll be a hip hang out. I'd go back for sure."

In the past I have ordered the brussels sprouts salad, the shrimp and grits and the salmon. The food was delivered in a timely manner. \n\nHowever, they have staffing issues. On the server side, I think they are just short of experienced servers. The couple of times that I did not eat at the bar the server had a trainee with them. If the restaurant succeeds, this should correct itself.\n\nMy criticism of the bar staff is more problematic. With the exception of one nice fellow, Simon,  the boss bartender and the other staff were condescending and slow to serve. I felt as if somehow I did something wrong or that I was sitting at the losers table.  Las Vegas is home to the the world's best hospitality workers.

It appeared that they were training new employees when we visited for lunch, as both the hostess and the servers were shadowing other employees. Everyone was cheerful and pleasant, and aside from the newbies asking a few questions of the more experienced, it didn't detract from the service at all.\n\nWe settled on an appetizer of the cheese and bacon tator tots. They were yummy! Deep fried tator tots, with bacon and cheese inside, served with sirracha ketchup- how can you go wrong? \n\nFor my main course, I got the CCB, which was their version of a Cobb sandwich. It was a chicken patty, served with lettuce, avocado, bacon, and onion, with their own special sauce. It was yummy! I loved the bread too, although it didn't hold up too well by the end. Their fries were good, not great (thin fries), but again, that sirracha ketchup helped add a little kick.\n\nMy friend enjoyed his burger as well, but I didn't get to taste it. They have a vast selection of beers, if you are into the brews, and what looked like a really fun outdoor area.\n\nAnother Downtown Summerlin restaurant checked off the list! I wouldn't mind getting detention here, though!"

            "review": "Being a frequent visitor of Downtown Summerlin, (Sephora....need I say more?) when I first noticed this place my boyfriend & I decided we needed to eat there ASAP. We came here on a Friday around 5:45 or so for happy hour. It was packed & we were told happy hour was in the bar area or outside on the patio. We chose the latter. It wasn't too hot & each booth had a fan. I absolutely LOVE the theme of this restaurant. The menus look like the old school composition notebooks. The managers walk around dressed like teachers  I mean, it's adorable. \n\nWhen we sat down it took a while for our server to come over to us & ask for drinks, but it was super busy so it wasn't a big deal. By the time he came over we already knew what we wanted to order from the happy hour menu (which has really good choices!) so we put in our food order as well. \n\nMy boyfriends beer came out first, and about 10 minutes later I finally received my drink. I ordered the crushed velvet which it's their spin on the classic Moscow Mule. It was REALLY good, and I'm not much of a drinker. It had the distinct flavors or blackberry & lavender. Super yummy. \n\nOur food came out pretty quickly. One by one. We ordered the speck & eggs which were really good! The ahi street tacos, also good. The farro & Brussels sprouts salad wasn't all that great, only because it's not my kind of thing. After receiving all our plates our server went to another table. We decided almost immediately that we wanted to order a couple more things before happy hour was over (at 6:30). I looked at my phone & saw it was 6:10 or so. I knew our server would be back before 6:30 so I wasn't worried. Also as a side note, when we got our first plate, my boyfriend ordered another beer. \n\nBut here's the thing...our server didn't come back. Not to check on us & see if we liked the food, not to drop off my boyfriends beer. Nothing. Finally another server or runner brought out his beer....20 min later. Yep. 20 MINUTES! What? That's just nuts. \n\nSo from 6:10 or so to 6:28 we waited for our server to come back so we could order more from the happy hour menu. Finally he came & we told him we'd like to order one more beer, and another dish from the happy hour menu (PB&J sliders) and something off the happy hour menu (shrimp & grits). To which he responded...\"well happy hour is actually over right now. But I'll try & see if I can get it in.\" I responded with \"but it's only 6:28. I thought happy hour ended at 6:30.\" And he replied with the same thing: \"I'll try to get it in\". I didn't bother telling him that if he had come back to check on us before 18 minutes...we could've put in our order sooner. I knew that if he couldn't \"get it in\" then I was going to speak to a manager. \n\nSo he left our table & went to the table directly across from us where a group of women were eating & they too ordered from the happy hour menu. He told them the same thing, that happy hour was over, but he'd \"try\" (like he's doing us all a favor. -__-) and they said what I didn't want to say. \"Well we wanted to order sooner but we couldn't find you. You never came to our table again. If you can't do it, I'd like to speak with a manager.\" He replied with \"I'll try\". \n\nAlas we all got our food at the happy hour prices, and it was bomb. Our server was a SUPER nice guy. He just needs to work on spot checking his tables more often. \n\nI have to say the shrimp & grits were delicious, but the star of the show is the PB&J sliders. We weren't expecting them to be a mind-blowing revelation. But they were. They have a beef patty, crunchy peanut butter, and habanero jelly. They are DIVINE. if you've made it this far into my review, (I applaud you.) and you take away only ONE thing from it, please let it be this: ORDER THE PB&J SLIDERS. \n\nCarry on, fellow Yelpers."

This went on for like 2 days of me calling them and them not answering any of my messages. Finally I got fed up and emailed their corporate office and voila the next day Nick emails his apology and is now able to accomodate our party but of course I already made reservations to another place (at Lazy Dog) which literally just took me 2 mins. over the phone to do.

They said it would be 20 min but it took about 10 so that was great. The patio has a really nice look and feel! I was excited! \nThen we get to the bad: the service. It took the server about 10-15 min to come take our drink order, took even longer to actually get the drinks. The water she said she'd bring didn't come until we asked for it again halfway through our meal.  We ordered a cheese plate which was delicious and the drinks were just as good. Too bad it would take forever every time we ordered a round. It took even longer to get our check and what seemed like an eternity to get our cards back to sign. \nWith so many other options to chose from, why go back to a place where they don't respect their customers enough to provide efficient service?"

When given the chance to dine here on Wednesday, I jumped at the chance to have dinner at the cool spot perched on the second floor of the \"Dining Arroyo\" at my favorite shopping center in Vegas. Although Public School did provide a unique, modern dining/lounge option with great views, the service and menu fell\nshort of my expectations.\n\nUpon arriving, we were seated immediately in a comfortable booth. The decor is modern and hip and I was excited about the experience. The server took a while to greet us (I saw him and another server arguing who was taking our table), but when he arrived, was friendly. We ordered a couple of beers and the Hummus as an appetizer.  The Hummus was excellent, with fried chick peas on top\nAnd served with excellent grilled flatbread.  For\nDinner I ordered the Thai noodle salad and he ordered shrimp and grits. Although I was looking for a cold noodle salad, this one fell short. There was a lot of dressing and the ingredients were just ok. To be fair, the shrimp and grits were supposedly excellent.  The beer was also ok, mine being a little hoppy and his not matching his favorite ciders he usually orders.\n\nMy gripe with this place is it seems to want to be pretentious and have an elevated menu, but the staff seems unmotivated to convey these ideas to\nThe guest. I would have loved a better recommendation for my beverage or maybe some ideas on special and unique menu options. Instead, we were asked if we were ready to order and if we wanted dessert, which is cool unless your intentions are to provide a more chef driven casual menu.\n\nP.S. There is nothing worse than opening a menu after arriving at your table and it being stuck together with food and whatever else. This is a particular annoyance at a supposed upscale-casual restaurant with the prices to match.. just saying.."

Bookshelves, books, world maps, an amazing solar system lighting piece, chalkboards, list goes on..The menu is on a 'notebook', loved it. And specialty drinks listed on college ruled paper on a small clipboard. Definitely a school-like atmosphere. We started with tater tots with sriracha ketchup (bomb!!), and ahi tacos (tasted a little too acidic for me), then went on to order the steak salad (steak perfectly cooked, though the salad itself a little too oily for my taste. Couldn't tell if I was drooling or if it was the salad oil dripping, but overall good.) My colleague ordered the Adobo taco with cilantro lime rice (I should've ordered that, that was crazy delicious), then sampled a few brews before deciding what we wanted. Our waitress was amazing, though I have to admit the service was a bit slower. It slowed after we ordered our main dishes (appetizers came out fairly quickly), so I can't blame the waitress (likely an issue in the kitchen, there weren't too many diners), as we were served after about 30-35 minutes (the drinks did hold us down enough to barely notice the time). Since we were in a bit of a rush at the end of the meal, we asked for our deserts to go, which we came to find out ALWAYS includes ice cream, so the waitress kindly offered me a gift card instead. I was happy with that, as I will definitely come back for recess."

This was the third time I've ordered it. When I arrived, it was nowhere near medium rare, closer to well done. I thought, well some siracha ketchup and it should be fine, as long as it still tastes good. Second bite, charcoal. I inspected it, totally burnt on the outside and even the cheese on top had burn spots! This was seriously the first time I've sent food back. The waitress was very sweet and apologetic, said they cook me another one right away. 10 min later the second burger shows up. Still not medium rare, but at least it wasn't burnt. I didn't want to wait another 10-15 min to start eating. So I finished my burger, paid, and left. To their credit, they did take the burger on the check.

They're a theme restaurant without being tacky about it.\n\nFARRO & BRUSSELS SPROUTS SALAD: surprisingly filling, this could be a late lunch. The sweet curry vinaigrette is interesting and there are a lot of contrasting textures.\nCRISPY CAULIFLOWER: The breading is super-thin and slightly spicy, with buffalo and bleu dipping sauces, served in a mini cast iron skillet. One of the better versions I've had, not greasy!\nPARM-TRUFFLE FRITES: You know you want them. They smell great, but let's get real, everyone has fancy fries these days, right? These come with a spicy ketchup and lemon aioli. Get 'em.\nSPECK & EGGS: Another dish everyone has, with the PS touch adding crispy prosciutto and a kick of spice.  Nicely creamy filling.\nCRISPY AHI TUNA TACOS: You can't go wrong with ahi. Tiny wonton shells filled with avocado and ahi, lightly dressed in ponzu. One of the lighter options, pairs well with the salad above.\nPB&J SLIDERS: The dish I was most excited about and the only one I was underwhelmed by. Menu only states \"blackberry habanero jam with smoked bacon\" and for some reason my eyes interpreted the word \"slider\" as a mini sandwich, most likely heated, on a thick challa-style bread. It's actually 3 typical sliders (mini patty and bun) with the two condiments gracelessly smeared on. With less PB and more J, this might have been palatable but dry beef + sticky PB = Nope.\n\nAll of this, with a beer and tip, for ~$40 can easily feed three. Service was awesome when it was around, bar staff were constantly busy to the point of being overwhelmed. Our server apparently went home altogether, and after nearly half an hour of waiting around to close our tab, Kourtnie kindly took care of us. \n\nNot sure I'd come back outside of recess hours, but it's definitely fun.

The inside is intelligently designed with old, retro school items such as lunch boxes, pom poms, megaphones in display cases and old bleachers nailed to the wall. The menu looks like a black and white speckled composition book and the napkins are lined notebook paper. Very smart marketing. \nFood was quite good, each item ordered was said to be delicious. Appetizers were buffalo cauliflower, Mac and cheese, bacon and cheese tater tots. Food ordered, Huntsburger with brown bag fries, chopped salad, roasted poblano with stuffed veggies and quinoa, fried chicken and waffles. \nSo why 3 stars? Our server!! Our dinner took 3 hours. I repeatedly saw her in the server hallway eating and talking to the other servers. She took 15 minutes to come over to us after we were seated, another 15 to come back with drinks, she disappeared while we waited to place our food orders, once other servers delivered our food, then not once were we checked on to see if we needed anything, my husband had no utensils. When we were finished, we kept waving down other servers to get our server for the check. Our server never arrived. Another server finally brought us our check. Our table time from sit down to leaving was almost 3 hours. \nDoubt I'd go out of my way to go back, I'll try other restaurants in the area."

From the patio, the decor to the vibes. \nThey have an excellent craft brew selection and the food was excellent. No complaints on that!\n\nThe only thing was service. I really struggled giving this place 4 stars but I had to go with 3 because our waiter was horrible. He was super nice, but he literally never checked on us and kept forgetting our drinks. We kept having to ask other waiters to get them for us. I don't think it was his area, but still, he wasn't busy. We went on a Sunday night at 8 and didn't leave until 10 because it took forever to get anything. That's a huge downer.\n\nFor the beer: I had Dawn of the Red. It was amazing. It's a hoppier amber with fruit notes. It's now one of my favorites. \n\nFood: \nFiery Calamari - very good and fried perfectly. It wasn't spicy at all though.\nShrimp and Grits -  It was super tasty. The grits are more of a grits cake and it has so much in it with a ton of flavor. The sauce was very rich and spicy. \nBeef short rib with parmesan mashed potatoes - it was very good and the au jus gravy was very rich. \nThe NUTELLA COOKIE SANDWICH. I'm going to be 100% honest. I'm not a dessert person. But when I saw this cookie on Yelp, I decided to go here solely for that purpose. And friends, it did NOT disappoint. It was the best cookie and ice cream dessert I've ever had in my life. The cookie was all gooey and soft. So perfect. \n\nOverall - I loved this place. I saw other servers being super tentative to their tables. We just got super unlucky. I would love to go again soon to try out other dishes and other yummy beers."

But what I can remember is what this review will be based on. \n\nWe came during lunch on a weekday. Probably the best time to come because we were seated right away. Had a nice seat with a view by the window. The place is decorated nice! Its modern but with a school theme. \nHence the name. \n\nI quickly started to notice the small things. Like the USB Plugs at every table.. The Composition Looking Menu.. The Edison Light Bulbs..\nALSO the dirty cloth napkin that was sitting in front of me. White cotton napkin. I was wearing black and being the gentleman that I am I placed the white napkin on my lap. That was a mistake. I didnt have my lint roller with me. \nOur waitress brought us our water. 2 dirty glasses and a dirty glass bottle filled with chilled tap water. \nWere they even washed?? \n2 strikes.. Waiting for the 3rd??\nI ordered a drink (diet coke). On the menu it never stated that they were tiny bottles and they were $2.50! I told the waitress.. I wish it said that on the menu or was disclosed that when I ordered..most big restaurants/pubs have soda on tap.\nWell this was really disappointing. \n\nOn to the food.\n\nFor starters we tried the Bacon Cheesy Tots. It was a recommendation from our waitress. \nDeep fried golden brown to perfection. Crispy outside and high in flavor! Sriracha Ketchup on the side! Yum!!\n\nBBQ Bison Burger with Quinoa Salad - Wow! They can really make a damn good burger!!  Patty was grilled to perfection (medium-well) for me. The BBQ sauce was good and not too sweet. The Quinoa was cooked perfect as well. \n\nNow this is what I dont remember.. My wife ordered a HotDog of some sort. I checked the online menu and I didn't see it. Maybe it was a special or something. \nBun was toasted yet soft center. The hot dog itself was overcooked. Like something you see inside 7-11 when they've been sitting on the rollers for hours upon hours. But, the toppings on it made up for it. \n\nIt was an ok visit for our lunch date. \nI'll try it again. Maybe a dinner date with my beautiful wife."

I was so exhausted from the past two weeks travels, I was dehydrated I ended up finishing the whole bottle of water by myself. (I had to drive later that night to pick up a friend so I wasn't going to order any alcohol anyway but drink menu looked nice.)\n\nI wasn't hungry but I needed to eat at dinner time so I ordered ahi tuna poke and chorizo Mac and cheese.  Ahi tuna poke was a server's favorite and it was not what I thought it was going to be but I still enjoy it. It's far from what I had in Hawaii, nothing like it. \n\nChorizos Mac and cheese was way too salty for me. I really force myself to eat it as I thought I needed to put food in my stomach but I couldn't. A server asked if I wanted to take it to go but I said it was too salty to eat. It wasn't that expensive at all and I did eat about 5 bites, so I was going to pay for it but she kindly took it out my bill.\n\nOverall it was a good experience for me, too bad I was not at my best condition to fully enjoy their restaurant."

Though, they don't exactly teach you anything beside decorate the entire place with school materials. For example, our menu was similarly designed to that of a composition notebook. And another menu was like a test paper. \n\nOn a beautiful afternoon, hang outside as you get a beautiful view of downtown Summerlin's plaza.  As for me, I had the pleasure to try a pre-birthday brunch here! A pal of mine was kind enough to take me here because it was a rather interesting venue. \n\nChicken sausage & cheddar grits 5/5: it's a whole lot of different flavors combined to one. And if you ask me, it's a really creative way to put an entree together. It truly represents what brunch is supposed to be with an incorporation of breakfast items tasting like lunch! So this entree comes with  \ntwo fried eggs, blistered tomatoes, grilled corn, bacon, greens, and beer-blanc sauce. I can't begin to describe my favorite part of each element. I think if you were to take one apart the whole dish would fall apart. Great execution and a must try. \n\nSetting: whether you're eating inside or out, it's a beautiful ambiance overall. Inside feels like a revamped take of a classroom with school-themed decors like books, globes, and rulers. It sounds a bit off-putting but it's really just the decors that sets them apart. Other than that, it looks like a modern restaurant with beautiful lighting and spacious dining experience. \n\nService: nothing special about the service. Our server seemed to take on her routine taking care of one customer to the other without tailoring anything special. At one point we got a bit antsy because we were finished with our meal and she hasn't stopped by in a while. I suggested to pay at the hostess' booth if she didn't arrive any time soon. Luckily she did, and everything went smoothly after that."

Happy Hour specials are available in the bar area and outside on the patio Mon-Fri from 3:30PM - 6:30PM. We ended up out on the patio with a nice view of Downtown Summerlin. I'm thanking my lucky stars we stumbled in here just in time for \"Recess\".  \n\nCRISPY CAULIFLOWER ($4 HH): The favorite of the evening. According to the menu, it's supposed to be served with blue cheese dressing AND buffalo sauce but we only got the blue cheese. The cauliflower is amazing! I'd highly recommend getting an order of these. 5/5 \n\nPARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES ($4 HH): A large portion of flavorful fries, but neither of us cared for the lemon aioli. They tasted better straight up! 4/5\n\nMARGHERITA PIZZA ($6 HH): Lightly dusted with red pepper flakes and a pinch of basil leaves. Would have liked for there to be more basil and less charred black dustiness on the crust. 3/5\n\nCRISPY NAKED WINGS ($6 HH): Came with 7 or 8 good-sized wings and my guy thought they tasted great. We learned Public School 702 does not serve ranch and that their sauces are made from scratch. 4/5\n\nCHORIZO MAC & CHEESE ($7 HH): Sans the chorizo so we could both share. The vinegar potato chips layered on top added an unexpected crunch, as did the surprise arugula. The mac & cheese was slightly spicy because of red pepper flakes in the dish - wise choice. 4/5   \n\nFOUNTAIN DRINKS ($2.75 HH): My husband ordered a coke and it came in one of those cutsie bottles. Unfortunately, refills are not free. The extra coke was $1.50. What are we, in Europe? I just had water, and our server left a nice vase of water at the table so I could get all the refills I wanted. 2/5\n\nVIBE: Public School 702 has a class act theme, complete with menus that look like old school notebooks, chalkboards displaying the specials, and an awesome galaxy set up that would win any science fair competition in the main dining area. This new gastro pub feels industrial and trendy, and I love it here! 5/5 \n\nSERVICE: Selina was an awesome server! She checked up on us often and was super nice. 4/5\n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nThere's still so many Happy Hour menu items I'm dying to try. And, I will definitely get the legendary Nutella Cookie dessert Yelpers are talking about next time I visit! Two thumbs up Public School 702.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #187"

It's definitely a much better atmosphere here. )\n\nBack to what matters, the drinks definitely seemed more appealing than the food menu. Most options have bacon bits and being that I don't eat pork made it annoying. I ended up getting the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower and Irish Stout Braised Short Rib to share. I definitely recommended both to try!!  It full of flavor and a great portion size. \n\nIm really big on customer service and as a new spot I definitely feel like the staff our waitress in particular wasn't very attentive to discussing what was best to try and lacked knowledge of the menu. It took her 20 minutes for our check. \n\nOverall it was cool and might visit again for the patio experience."

We both lost our appetites, the server never checked to see how my son was, never apologized for either thing, and a manager never even came over to say one word.

We requested to sit on the patio and the hostess said it would be just a minute while they set our table up. I'm almost positive she forgot about us. We stood there for over ten minutes. Another hostess asked if we were waiting for someone, when we replied that we were waiting for the table, she looked around a little confused. \n\nWhen we were finally sat at the table that had been ready for almost ten minutes, we were handed menus. We looked them over and got excited about all the delicious options to eat and drink. Lots of craft beers on their menu (see photo). We asked for water while we looked over the menus. Another server came over and took our drink order. My boyfriend got the lavender vanilla and I ordered a Cabernet. We received our drinks, but still no water. My wine was fantastic and my boyfriends drink was perfect for sipping (I'm not really into whiskey, but it was good). \n\nWe ordered the quinoa poblano prepared vegan with no cheese, broccolini prepared vegan with saut\u00e9ed garlic, kale slaw with Brussels prepared vegan, and the brown bag potato fries (not vegan) but for my boyfriend;). Our server came to the table with water (finally) and some bad news. The poblano couldn't be prepped vegan:( it's prepped with cheese, and so is the kale shaved Brussels:(. Back to the menu... I opted for the veggie chili that's created with a mushroom thickening base (vegan). Granted it was 100+ degrees outside I wasn't super excited but it worked. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo Mac and cheese, since we couldn't share the poblano. Our food eventually arrived, but my chili had some cream on top... Had to send it back and wait again. The broccolini was amazing. Perfectly seasoned and saut\u00e9ed to a crisp crunch. We finished it in no time. We were being attacked by bugs by the time my food made it to the table. Bug lights would be ideal for their patio. The chili was awesome. It came with a kale waffle I couldn't eat but it was filling by itself. \n\nOverall... It was a good meal. A little disorganized and patience was definitely a virtue we were practicing that evening. Would I return? Yes, happy hours on the patio with my laptop, school books, and boyfriend are going to be ideal considering they have convenient USB and outlets located on every booth. It's pretty new... Practice your patience... It has a lot of potential."

Also found a old dried out piece of Canadian bacon in my Mac and cheese, turned me off to the whole meal after that.

It is a nice balance of protein and greens and the dressing isn't heavy, so you feel good about yourself after eating it.  That feeling might go away if you eat gelato afterwards, but still, salad like this is good for you.\n\nIf you're in Downtown Summerlin, try recess here."

The food is alright, but nothing compared to all the options in DT Summerlin.\n\nNow, look-wise this place is cool. The interior and table settings are all \"school\" themed. Cute idea. Would be ideal place for someone wanting to try a wide variety of beers. Not being a beer drinker myself, I found myself with little options. The cocktails were okay, but nothing I would order again. If you are a big beer fan, definitely check this place out."

The menu looked like a marble notebook and the cocktail napkin looked like a note passed from a classmate.               \n        Our server, Jared Smith gave us a great rundown of the menu and explained the beer selection really well. We were able to sample quite a few before making our selections and by the time we left the restaurant we had ordered almost all oft them. \n         I would definitely recommend the shrimp and grits and the cauliflower, delicious.

For my entr\u00e9e I got that Jidori chicken and waffles. Hands-down the best chicken and waffles I have ever had.  My husband got the short ribs which he said was excellent. I also tried two cocktails,  one was the passionfruit mojito. It is made with gin instead of the traditional rum and it worked so tasty. I also tried the guavalajara a take on a margarita with guava. So fantastic. My kids had to be cheese pizzas because they're kids,  but they both tried bites of everything else we had and loved it.  We will be back soon!!"

They have a nice selection of beers and will give you a small taste if you can't decide.  During brunch on Saturday they have $4 beers, making it even better! \n\nI got the steak salad which was Delicious!  The steak was tender and cooked medium rare, the way I like it. The salad had both red and yellow beets, making it tasty and healthy.  It was so good, that I didn't realize until I ate it all, that the bacon was left off. I told our waitress and she was so nice about it and offered us a free dessert!  My son got a burger, which was huge and juicy. It came with fries, which were also delicious.  He said he would get it again. \n\nWe decided to try the ice cream sandwich made with chocolate chip cookies.  It was large enough for us to share.  It was yummy!  Then our nice waitress,  Katie, surprised us with the banana pudding in a jar. She said we had to try it and she was right. It is so smooth and creamy and made with vanilla wafers. May be the best banana pudding I ever had!\n\nThe place is clean and has plenty of seating both inside and out. I will sit outside next time when it's a bit warmer.  I love the menu that is made to look like an old composition notebook from the past. The decor is wonderful, with old Worldbook Encyclopedias on a huge bookcase.

The patio looked fun, and I love the kind of look and feel they were going for, so upstairs we went. \n\nWe were seated immediately, which wasn't surprising as it was nearly 9pm, and the dining area and patio are both pretty expansive. Our server was friendly and let us know that it was their opening day. \n\nWe were tempted by several of the appetizer choices, myself the the buffalo cauliflower, and my husband the bacon tots, but we exercised self control...mostly because a picture of their Nutella cookie popped up on the slide show at the bar, and my husband's eyes glazed over.\n\nHe decided on the shrimp and grits, and I went with the farro and brussels salad, subbing roasted chicken for the scallops. It took quite a while to get our food, but we understood it was opening day and there were still service and kitchen bugs to be smoothed out. Nearly 40 minutes after we ordered, our food arrived. \n\nHe was very happy with his portion of shrimp, although the they were slightly overlooked. The grits...which were prepared like seared polenta, were tasty, and he liked the greens and grilled corn. \n\nMy salad was excellent, the chicken was really flavorful, and that M word I hate, that rhymes with hoist, or joist. I love the texture of farro, and it was excellent combined with shaved brussel sprouts, butternut squash, pecans and dried cranberries. It was extremely filling. \n\nWe shared the nutella cookie sandwich, which was two huge chocolate chip cookies, served warm, slathered in Nutella with vanilla ice cream sandwiched in between. By shared, I mean he let me have a couple bites without cracking my knuckles with his spoon. \n\nI deducted a star because even for an opening day, 40ish minutes was a an excessive time to wait for our meal, without any interaction from a server. We both agreed we wanted to try their brunch menu, and saw other things on the dinner menu we wanted to try. As long as they get their service issues ironed out, I see this place as being very successful, and a great addition to Downtown Summerlin."

If I had been with my friends having some cocktails, I wouldn't mind but being that I was with my dad, it made any lengthy conversation difficult. \n\nElectrical outlets at the table. That's right you technology obsessed folks out there. There is an individual outlet at most tables with USB ports. I'm sure this is a huge thumbs up for most but this freaked me out and made me sad quite honestly.  \n\nManagers? There had to be at least 8 men walking around in these plaid shirts with their super important iPads and things in their hands just tapping away and meetings over here and meetings over there. I was just so random and so bizarre.\n\n\nBut, none of this had to do with the food or service and let's face it, that's why we go to a restaurant. So hands down, I will be back."

I just wished the service and the food was better!\n\nFOOD\nNothing really special here. We tried a number of the appetizers (the bacon cheddar tots, the buffalo cauliflower, and the calamari) along with a couple of drinks, but they were all pretty basic. The appetizers and the drinks were around $10 each. Nothing that I would rave about or come back for. The drinks were good and I did like the fact that they have a variety of beers on tap, but other than that I would not come back solely for the food.\n\nSERVICE\nThis is the main reason why I am only giving them a 2 star rating. Our waiter didn't really seem like he knew what he was doing. He would take our orders and then come back to ask what they were again because he didn't write them down. When he had brought the water bottle to us, he also didn't pour any of it initially and when he saw our glass was empty, we were the ones to ask him to get another bottle of water instead of anticipating our needs. The other waiter delivering food passed us because she too was unsure where the food was to go. I felt like their system was clunky.\n\nLOGISTICS\nThere's never really any issue for parking when we go here. There also wasn't a wait to get in, so that was good. They have USB/regular outlets where you can plug your phone in so that was cool.\n\nThis place isn't bad. It looks nice and modern, but the service is poor. The managers need to retrain the staff if anything. I wouldn't recommend others to go here. Try another place with better food and better service!"

Pretty busy but our waiter Zo was very attentive, and friendly. He gave us a thorough overview of the menu. I chose truffle steak because I'm truffle anything addicted!!! I'd probably be willing to eat crickets if they were truffle soaked. Anyway,my bf orders pepperoni pizza and I'm disappointed because it doesn't sound exotic. When it arrives it looks delicious and I'm no longer upset with him. My truffle salad looks amazing too but I'm let down because I really hardly taste the truffle :( his pizza was amazing. Though! Simple as it was, it was very impressive!!"

The deviled eggs were not your traditional Deviled eggs but we're very tasty. The bacon cheddar tots were God as well. The spaghetti and shrimp and grits were both good as well. The bison burger was a bit disappointing. What really impressed is that our friend left her leftovers behind and the waiter chased us down outside to give them to her. He definitely went above and beyond and it impressed me. We will be back."

Although known for their beer, Public School makes the BEST n/a drinks for us moms to be, which really makes a difference in picking a place to suit my cravings and desire for something other than water.  \n\nOur last visits, our waiter TYLER was amazing.

I didn't let this distract me from at least trying it...\n\nI'm glad I did. I probably won't be back though.\n\nLet me tell you why. This restaurant is big. So big the echo of everyone talking makes you feel like you're in a cafeteria. So big the food, while good, ends up cold if you aren't next to the kitchen. So big, it takes a server five minutes to get to one side and back.\n\n...However, there are some big flavors here that I wouldn't shy away from. The tots are delicious, and the sriracha ketchup add the right kick to compliment the cheese and bacon filling. The chorizo mac n' cheese had some great textures and a full bite with everything in it showed what this dish could do (if piping hot). The Jidori Chicken & Waffles was a hit. I hope they use the cornbread muffin as some sort of breakfast dish, because I'd eat it morning, noon, and night.\n\nI recommend trying Public School. It has a lot to look at, a great beer selection, and a short, yet formidable cocktail list."

Keep in mind we almost left because of the long quote.\n\nWe sat down at the bar and were given menus immediately.  After the menus went down the attention went away.  It seemed the staff behind the bar was more interested in sampling the beers on draft than they were servicing the patrons.  We finally were asked if we had been helped and put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and ordered a cheese platter.  After 10 minutes at the bar we were texted that our table was ready...??  definitely the door needs help quoting parties accurately.  We had to cancel the cheese platter and went to our table outside.\n\nThe outside and inside are 2 different animals.  The inside was very loud and reminded me of a college bar atmosphere.  The outside was much quieter and enjoyable.\n\nWe ordered the cheese platter, the hummus platter, and the chop salad.  All dishes were great and portions were more than enough.  The server was very friendly and noticed my wife from another visit.  Only issue I had was that she spent too much time chatting with other tables and it hurt the refills of our wine and ordering process.\n\nThere seemed to be A LOT of staff at the restaurant.  All in all I loved the food and the concept is unique.  If given the choice and the weather is favorable go for the patio booths."

We were seated right away and I commented how big this place was. The menus and the napkins definitely fit in with the theme so good job on the details. Now on with the goodies...\n\nI couldn't decide on what appetizer I wanted to try. I ended up picking the Mac and cheese over the cauliflower even though the hubby said I could get both. However, being 9 months pregnant I can only take a few bites and feel full. I already decided before I got there that I would get the Fig and Prosciutto pizza. My other half decided on the bangers and mash. The food came out fairly quickly luckily because I was a lil hungry. The fig and prosciutto pizza was good, but a bit spicy for this preggo. I didn't know there was a bit of a spice factor and I wouldn't have ordered it otherwise. It was good, but I wish there was more of a fig taste. I couldn't see any fig bits or really taste it so that was a lil disappointing. I didn't try the bangers...only the mash. You know me and carbs! It was a good sized portion for lunch and the price definitely was well worth it. It was gone by the time I was done eating so I assumed it was delicious or my husband was really hungry. ;) As for the Mac and cheese I really liked the kale in it. The ladies next to us kept eyeing our Mac and cheese and I told them they had to get it next time. Not a big fan of the chorizo but that's what your eating partner is for!\n\nOverall, I liked this place and the atmosphere. I wouldn't be afraid of bringing my kids because it is fairly noisy so other people wouldn't notice if your kid was talking loudly. Service was great in the beginning and at the end our server was no where to be found. Granted it was the lunch rush so just be prepared for a bit of a wait if you go during a rush."

The ginger in the apple Jack was way to strong, and the tequila in the guava drink overpowered any other flavor in it. Also on a side note, I feel like the bartender was new because when we were watching her make our drinks, she measured literally eveeything.. and it still tasted bad.\nSo the stars received was for the food! We had the calamari, shrimp grits, mushroom pizza and the bison burger. The calamari was delicious! Had a nice crunch and the perfect amount of seasoning, and the ginger aoili paired really good with it. We also had the shrimp grits. I don't really like grits, so I picked off a few bites of shrimp and that was tasty. I really liked the flavor and the sauce surrounding it.  We also ordered the bison burger. For never having bison before, I felt like the burger was more so plain jane. I've had much better tasting burgers for less money. It did come with fries though. Lastly, the mushroom pizza was a very good choice. You can never go wrong with mushroom pizza with truffle oil. Absolutely delicious. The only thing wrong was that my friend expressed that she didn't want any chili flakes on it, and the server insisted there were none, yet you can literally see the flakes of chili on the pizza. Even after she pointed it out, the server could care less about his & the kitchen's mistake. \nAfter all of that, we tried to order dessert, but the kitchen was closed. Apparently we ordered the pizza 40 minutes after the kitchen closed, but what good did that do if the server didn't even tell us when last call was??? I thought that was dumb. And mostly the reason for the 2 stars. So we were able to order cookies and milk, which didn't fulfill anyone's tastebuds..\nOverall, I wouldn't go back. Even if I'm shopping at downtown summerlin, there are far better bars/ places to eat at Downtown summerlin or closeby."

When I requested marinara it arrived ice cold with zero flavor. For $12 we received $1 worth of product. Three of us ordered and each dish was just ok. I had the poblano peppers with rice. Just ok. My friends had shrimp with white cheddar grits and fish and chips. Well .. I think nice plump shrimps would be the way to go not medium sized average shrimps. And the fish and chips ... really greasy while the breading was extremely larger than the piece of fish. Very disappointing. Not thrilled with the Pinot Noir selection. Looks like the girls night out needs to find a new place to spend $150 plus tip."

Their menu and beer selection is good and there are some unique items but at the end of the day, it's just another Yardhouse, BJs, etc. Vegas has a million of these places already so it really didn't stand out in any significant way. The theme and decor are pretty cool though so that was a bit of a different spin on things. I had the shrimp and grits, were were tasty and a portion that was a decent size. My wife had the Chicken and Waffles were were a large portion and very good. Father-in-law had a jalapeno and pepperoni pizza that he liked and mom-in-law had fish and chips...they looked nice and she said they were OK. That's the good. Now time for the bad.\n\nService was OK but not great. It was a busy Friday night but still...not the best. My meal really wasn't very hot considering it was being served in a skillet so my bet is that it was sitting under a heat lamp for a few minutes. It was just hot enough to eat and not cold enough tow warrant sending it back but it should have been hotter. While they do have a decent selection of brews, their prices were really high for what you were getting. Once you start charging $9+ for a pint, that's getting to be a bit obnoxious, regardless of what kind of micro-brew it came from. \n\nAll of that is insignificant though by comparison to the noise. Let me make this as clear as possible. This place is SO FUCKING LOUD!!! I've been to Metallica concerts that weren't as loud as eating in this place. Seriously, if you are planning on having any form of conversation during your meal, you need to bring a bullhorn and set the volume on that sucker to 11. If you are not planning on having a conversation, ear-plugs should be mandatory. When we all left, it felt so pleasant to just hear a little silence for a few minutes. The noise alone is the reason none of us would ever return, so in case you missed it the first time, this place is FUCKING LOUD INSIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

This day and age they add \"special\" ingredients and theres the risk of throwing off your tastebuds. Thats what happened to me.  Horseradish? Who would have thunk? I dont.. Its a fail for me but you might like it. They replaced it for me, with Shrimp n Grits. First bite was an epic win, subsequent bites i found  the shrimp over cooked and the sauce fell a little flat. It was tasty enough but not perfect. My partner had the Quinoa Salad, epic HIT! She was thoroughly satisfied. We finished with the banana pudding which i call not cho mommas banana puddin.. Cuz it aint lol. It was light and airy and not too sweet. Its Grey-ish hue threw me off. It wasnt pretty and could have used more cookie.  Oh and Public School; in my humble opinion you can lose the dark chocolate shavings throughout the pudding, its overpowering. Please and thank you. Lastly the cookie, cuz we are gluttons.... was not so amazing. The ice cream was not rich nor decadent. The cookie was good, my partner liked the nutella but said the carmelized bacon was an epic miss. Her advice PBS 702... Toasted coconut... Jus sayin.  Thanks for a cool date night! But there is room to grow!"

The food selection doesn't seem like there are many options, but as you read through the menu there are actually quite a few.  Had the bison burger with the kale & brussels slaw.  The quality of the food combined with the taste was superb!  Pricing is very reasonable and not over priced.  Service and friendliness of staff was great!"

We left before we even got sat do to the horrible looks from the waitstaff, manager and hostess. \nWhen we arrived after the holiday parade we were told a 15 minute wait for table for 3.  Well 30 min later and seeing 6 other parties being sat before us, getting dirty looks from the wait staff, a hostess glaring at my kids and never speaking to us during the wait, a manager obviously seeing us just wait there and not even acknowledging us with a hi, we just left. \nI will spend my money with  other restaurants in summerlin who have amazing customer service. This place just left a bad taste in my mouth. Felt so uncomfortable there. Was really looking forward to the place too . Oh well!!!!"

The restaurant environment & decor is very nostalgic.\n\nTried the Earl of Juniper, just a  tad disappointed cuz I couldn't taste any lavender (which maybe was overpowered by the Earl Grey). Bacon Cheddar Tots were so good even though the app is small. The calamari was also good with the aioli & it was more generous in portion. Wild Mushroom & Taleggia pizza was delish. I usually get the Shorty Bowl (sooo fkn good!) but today I'm trying the BBQ Bison Burger & Fish/Chips with the bae.\n\nOh & there are games like giant Jenga, beer pong & Connect 4! That's always a plus & would make any dinner date less boring.\n\nI'd still come back."

There needs to be a awareness of this. Apparently it's a group effort. Date rape, stealing wallets and purses. We are nurses, and I took her to our ER. Everything was negative except date rape drug. I'm going to make a big deal of this, we did a police report, but I'm not stopping there."

            "review": "We stopped in to have a drink on their patio overlooking DTS fountain area. It's a nice place to have a drink and enjoy the nice weather. The margaritas were $11.75 each. They were served in a small rocks glass. They were good though. I could tell they were made with fresh lime juice and not sour mix.\n\nWe were there during happy hour, so we ordered some apps from the happy hour menu.\n\n$7 Ahi Poke - served with tortilla chips and covered in a sweet sauce. It was very good.\n\n$5 Buffalo Cauliflower - this was excellent. Surprisingly very good. They fry cauliflower like chicken wings and serve it with hot sauce and ranch.\n\n$4 White Bean Hummus - they serve it with grilled pita. I have had better hummus, but it was good. I really enjoyed the grilled pita.\n\n$4 Quinoa Salad - it was very good. It reminded me of quinoa tabouli without the parsley.\n\nThe service was great and I really like how the dining area is set up with the patio and the bars. I will definitely be back for dinner. Their menu looks like a winner to me. If the apps are a preview of what lies ahead, then I think I will enjoy it.\n\nI'll be back!"

The brioche bun was soft and the patty juicy. I was so impressed. The beet salad was okay. It was overly drenched in balsamic dressing. Overall it was a good lunch"

            "review": "I struggled with giving this three star review knowing that I should probably be giving them two. So I planned a brunch date with my girlfriend here this past Sunday because we were looking for a place we both never have been and somewhere that offered some bottomless mimosa's! Now knowing that Sunday Brunch times can always be so busy I went ahead and booked a reservation through YELP including in the notes that the outdoor seating on the balcony would be preferred. Once we arrived we were told that they don't guarantee the outdoor seating and that it's first come first served. Initially we were told they didn't have anything available and then the girl comes back and says that they did but it was in the sun. We said sure let's try and see if this is going to work and it didn't so we moved back inside. Once we were seated we were greeted by a very nice waiter who was new and did the best he could. He disclosed multiple times that they were really backed up and that the service may seem slow. I went with the bottomless mimosa option and here I guess they offer it to where you can either have it with beer (yuck!) or the traditional way which is orange juice. I asked for orange juice to only receive the exact opposite which was beer! To add insult to injury I was already annoyed that I had to wait almost 15 minutes for my drink I just was completely over the entire situation quite frankly. Our food took forever which was a simple eggs benedict pizza and the smothered breakfast burrito! My burrito was TRASH I cut into it to only find that the hash browns were all burnt and the egg was hard. Gotta be kdding me? The appetizer's came out AFTER the main course which was another strike. It was just an entire train wreck that I could go on and on about but I wasn't happy at all about this being my first visit. I must've caught them on a off day because the entire experience was ridiculous. The waiter was so nice and I felt bad he was new and had no control that's the only reason they are getting the 3 stars and not 2."

            "review": "Overall, a nice dining experience.  We came with a party of 5 for lunch on a Saturday and were offered the brunch and lunch menus, which was nice.  We had a bunch of apps: buffalo cauliflower, the meat/cheese cutting board, calamari, ahi poke, and speck and eggs.  All were very nicely prepared and fresh.  Be aware there are 4 eggs in the speck & eggs, and the ahi poke is a bit sweeter than your average poke.  Entrees included bangers & mash, chicken sandwich, smothered breakfast burrito, steak salad and the vegetable hash and eggs.  All were very tasty.  The only \"complaint\" I have is that the menu was a bit limited and they brought the entrees out while we were still working on the apps (a pet peeve of mine).  We will return."

None stop techno / drum and bass for an hour? No thanks. Public School just doesn't seem like the place for that. I would go back to Public School again but probably not on a Saturday. Apparently it's the same DJ every time."
