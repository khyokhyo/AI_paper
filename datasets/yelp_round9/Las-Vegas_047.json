Las Vegas only has one location in south pointe casino and they are always busy, every once in a while I can sneak in and beat the line. My suggestion is get some stand alone locations. The milk shake at this place are always amazing! you can tell they are homemade and use fresh ingreedients. The steakburgers are a little small but delish and always flavorful! They have steakfranks and they are also good, I get them from time to time. I have always wished they had bigger fries, but they did improve them with adding seasoning like garlic herb wish makes them sooooo good!!! You would think instead of shoestrings they would have steak fries to go with the name..lol I will always love me some steak n shake and they do their customers right which is another plus once i got someone elses order and didn't notice til I was on the highway heading home and I called the store they send me coupons in the mail for 2 free burgers, fries and shakes that's what i call awesome customer svc!!"

French fries are thin and crisp and you get to choose add-on flavors for a price.\n\nOr first visit, we had a very nice & attentive young gentleman serving us. There were only 4 of us dining at the time.\n\nOur second visit on our last day in Vegas, there were 15 of us all spread out occupying 3 tables. We had a woman serving our party. Maybe she was overwhelmed, but the service was horrible. She kept on forgetting my son's soda. She never cracked a smile either."

The price was great!  $8 for a double cheeseburger, fries and shake.  however, the burger was small and not great.  the fries are the shoestring type and I like the thinker type of fry and the milkshake was not that great.  Service was fine and I liked the 50s d\u00e9cor.  Food wise, did not do it for me."

            "review": "Finally had the opportunity to check out Steak 'n Shake before a session of midnight bowling with the homies.\n\nThis review deserves a follow up as i am feeling a bit under the weather and the congestion blocked out some of the flavors. Despite all that it was still pretty good. If i had to describe Steak n' Shake it would be a burger joint half way between Sonics and Smash Burger.\n\nI really wanted to try the 3 way chili or grab a Chicago Dog meal but this place is best known for their burgers. So burgers we shall order!\n\nSpicy Chipotle (no onion)\nFirst impression when this burger came out was a sudden burst of realization: 'That's why they offer multiple meat patties...these are tiny.' Not sure if it was the burger or my cold but there wasnt much heat in this burger. The pepperjack cheese couldnt stand on it's own against the two meat patties and if they werent there i probably wouldnt have noticed them missing, the sauce was spread too thin so i couldnt taste it in every bite. The diced Jalapenos were the most disappointing, they removed all the seeds and diced up the flesh so there was no heat and everyone knows it's the seeds that pack a punch not the fruit itself. Without seeds the bits of Jalapenos tasted like diced up green bell pepper. The real magic comes from those small beef patties. Anthony M was right they're small but they do pack a lot of flavor.\n\nStrawberry Milkshake\nA cool note is they're willing to split a large milkshake into two smaller ones with no additional cost. The shake it self was really good.\n\nOverall i would like to come back and give the chili or the Chicago Dog a try. The steakburgers are pretty tasty here but i would stick to the basic burger instead of something fancy as the patties have enough flavor to stand on their own."

I decided to check it out, but I have to say that this place was only decent.  \n\nI honestly felt the place was like an East Coast version of In-n-Out, and I'm not a fan of the West Coast chain either.  Although the burgers were fresh and the patties were crispy, they lacked the overall quality that I find in places such as Bachi.\n\nMy favorite was the milkshake that I got.  It was very thick and fattening.  Nothing better in a shake!\n\nThe service was friendly without being intrusive.  Like I said, the place is decent.  The quality of food and service is good, but not great."

We were in in 20 minutes or so but it was definitely worth the wait! \n\nBurgers and fries were delicious and the milkshakes even better! We ordered the portobello mushroom burger, the philly burger, and the royal burger and everyone loved it! \n\nNot to mention, I have never been to a restaurant that took care of customers with food allergies like these guys did. I told them about My sons peanut allergy and they immediately notified the manager. They got all new items (meat, buns, condiments) from the back and also made His milkshake in a completely different area to prevent cross contamination! Normally other restaurants would just say, sorry that's made in a zone with nuts so you can't order it!\n\nVery very satisfied with the service and the food here! I never take the time to write reviews, but definitely felt this one was necessary!"

The waiter took our order and then we never saw him again. Another waiter brought our drinks but did not bring my kids shakes. Several minutes later the shakes came and I must say these were the worst vanilla shakes I've ever tasted. Something was wrong! Then I notice my glass is not only dirty, but sticky. At this point I'm trying to find our waiter but he never comes near us. So we finally get another guy's attention and when I explain the nasty shakes and dirty glass to him he asks, \" do you want to change them?\"  Duh!! Of course we do. He brings me a new soda in a clean glass and says the shakes are coming. Then the food comes. The fries tasted like they had been under a warmer forever and my sandwich was wrong. I didn't special order it, they just forgot how to make it I guess. Still no shakes. Someone tells me they are working on it. We talk to the manager who tells me they only have one person who can make shakes....seriously?! She tells me there will be no charge so I told her to forget the shakes and left.  Horrible experience. I will never go back!!"

While walking around, I could not get past how gross and filthy the store was. Looked like a food fight broke out and no one cleaned up. Even worse, some of the food under the tables looked like it had been there a while.\n\nI walked out, headed down to IN N OUT and once again, had an OUTSTANDING burger. \n\nOn the way, I called the Steak n shake customer service line that was on the managers card. The lady that answered the phone took my info, said something that sounded like thank you and hung up. \n\nNot only was this place gross and dirty and had horrible service, they did not seem to even care."

Prior to my first visit at a Steak 'n Shake, all I heard from everyone was that this place had the best burgers and it's cheap.  I have to admit, it is cheap.  But not the best burgers.  Don't get me wrong, the burgers were pretty good. Taste is similar to Johnny Rockets.  Since my belly was happy at the end, I have to give this place at least 4 stars.  \n\nNow for the highlight of this place...the shakes.  I don't normally order shakes after digesting over 1500 calories in one sitting, but was also told that I had to try the shakes.  Shakes are one of the best.  If you choose to eat here, look around.  I bet almost everyone is having a shake.  Word gets around.  \n\nI will be back...but only for the shakes."

My uncle stayed at South Point a while back and we dined in here. They give a decent amount of fries when dining in. I ordered a salad with Grilled chicken on it. I forgot which one it's called but it had a raspberry dressing. Sweet dressings aren't my thing but it was ok. I'd say come for the burgers not the salads because the burgers are better but it's nice to have healthy options as well. Last visit I ordered the Portabella steak burger and boyfriend had the jalape\u00f1o crunch. Let's just say his burger was way better than mine. There is always a wait here whether you're dining in or taking it to go.  Just steer clear of the ranch because its absolutely the nastiest ranch you will ever taste,but the milkshakes are to die for. Legit real milkshakes."

Got the Frisco Melt, loaded with flavor (LOVE the sauce, and the buttered toast is fantastic), very juicy, and a seasonal Caramel Apple Shake (super rich in flavor also - the apple flavoring was a bit artificial but overall it was a darn good shake, thick enough that you'll be spooning it out til the ice cream melts enough to suck it up through the straw.)

Formica tabletops, vinyl seat covers, servers dressed in white - all very cute. And old rock and roll playing loudly in the background. Sets a malt-shoppe atmosphere.\nService: The place was pretty busy, but our server came by pretty soon after we were seated. There wasn't much to our order. It came out in an appropriate amount of time.\nFood: Hard to comment on the food since our order was just for a shake. My wife and I shared a Nutella shake. Who knew there is such a thing as a Nutella shake? We told our server we were sharing and he brought it out in 2 separate cups - each with its own decorated whipped cream topping - nice touch. And the shake was to die for!! Next time we are at South Point for a movie, it will be hard not to stop in for dessert here."

            "review": "So the feeling that you get when you enter a Steak 'n Shake is an old school 50s kind of diner. If you have been to a Johnny Rockets, it has the same kind of feel to it. It isn't something I'm particularly use to since I don't go to places like that often. I don't know the variety of foods that they served in those old school diners, but I would expect a wide range of foods, but here, it's pretty much burgers and sandwiches.\n\nWhen I went with my party, our party was too big to sit on one table and the larger table they had was taken up and so they had to break us up into two booths which were adjacent, which wasn't bad, but not ideal for social interaction. When we sat down, it took a while before our server came with our waters and a while before we got our orders taken, which was just a bit annoying. After we ordered, the second table that we had ordered the same time as my table, and somehow got their food and milkshakes around 10 minutes before our table, which is quite baffling to me. When our food came, it was pretty much what we ordered which composed of some burgers and sandwiches. Our server didn't come by very often to fill up our water or come by to check up on us, which would be nice to do at least once throughout our meal and not just at the very end, but it's alright, at least we didn't ask for anything major.\n\nThe food selection here is nothing too special. This isn't the type of Denny's style diner where they have a wide array of food to choose from, just some burgers, sandwiches, chili, milkshakes, and I can't remember anything else really. This isn't my type of food to eat very often, but my friends wanted to pay this place a visit and they do have a decently cheap menu, which was a bonus. If you wish to pay this place a visit, I would say just go, but don't expect anything too special."

I would say hell no!\n\nHonestly, I think In N Out and Fatburger are way better than this place and  better yet you don't have to sit in a long ass line for 20 minutes to get your food. \n\nIf you're gonna stand in line for a burger for 20 minutes that bad boy has got to be the best tasting burger outside of kobe burger which this definitely wasn't!"

            "review": "Steak n Shake comprises one of the 4 pillars of legendary burger chains.  The other 3 being In n Out, Five Guys, and White Castle.  Sometimes the hype surrounding them creates stratospheric expectations, but let's face the reality - they are all chains, and although you may not get the best burger you have had in your life, it is the best burger you can get at such an affordable price.\n\nSo Steak and Shake was high on my list of places to try since it is a bit of an oddity in the burger world. The CEO Sardar Biglari seems to strike many people as being a Warren Buffet wannabe (a compliment).  He has taken the Steak n Shake franchise and built it into a cash cow that allows him to buy stakes in other companies (pretty punny).  He has gone shopping for insurance companies in the past.  That's right, get your burger and your insurance policy all in one place.  In addition, he has renamed the company Biglari Holdings as well has issued a 20:1 stock reversal.  When was the last time you saw a stock for a burger joint at $400 a share?!?!?  This smacks of Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway strategy of creating a bajillion dollar company, but with much tastier offerings.  Have you ever purchased any handkerchiefs with Berkshire Hathaway logo on it? Eventually, that business was phased out.\n\nSo, off I went to Steak n Shake to see how Biglari's plan is coming along.  Then I saw the ridiculous lines and wait times.  I am pretty certain that this will probably continue to be a good cash generating business.  Once the hype dies down, the wait will be much less, but definitely a far better run business than Krispy Kreme.  Remember the lines there? Nowadays, it's Krispy what?  \n\nBut let's get to the burgers.  I give a ton of props to the photographer for the menu as he/she has done wonders in making the burger look fantastically big.  When it arrives you will most likely be dumbfounded and think that they brought the wrong one.  I ordered the Wisconsin Buttery which is a double and I seriously doubt that it had more meat than a Big Mac.  But it was pretty decent.  It's hard to go wrong when you slap butter on something.  The quality of the meat was pretty good, although a bit miniscule.  It reminded me of jumping into a cold pool - major shrinkage.  Milkshakes are wonderfully rich and creamy, that it should be spoon eaten rather than using a straw unless you have the suction powers of a porn star.  And the cloth napkins were nice, but definitely a bit out of place.  Fries are super skinny and crisp, but nothing fantastic.  Their chili reminds me of a can of Hormel with beans.\n\nThe best way to enjoy your burger here is to drop your expectations - plain and simple.  Just remember to add 1 patty to what you would normally eat."

When we heard that they opened one in Vegas a few months ago and knew we were going to vacation there, we had to go!\n\nSteak N Shake in Vegas is located in the far corner of the South Point Casino by the movie theatre. Getting there we saw they had two lines. One for take out and one for dining in.Although the line looked pretty big for dining in, we made it in at a good time. Only took at most 15 minutes. After waiting in line, we sat down with our menus and to entertain our toddler, she was given a Steak N Shake hat, a car you put together and a childs menu with crayons. \n\nThe food is pretty consistent with the other Steak N Shakes I've been to and it did not disappoint. My hubby ordered a Double Steak burger with cheesefries. Steak burger was juicey and cooked full of flavor..Made to order for him as he likes his plain with only cheese and ketchup. Yeah..not a whole lot but still tasty! Their crispy thin fries smothered in cheese sealed the deal with him. Every bite he was in pure heaven! He also ordered the Butterfinger shake that just made it even better!\n\nI ordered their Frisco Melt..Basically a juicy steak patty on sourdough bread with their tangy frisco sauce. On top of that had them put lettuce and tomato which compliments the sandwich well. I also had the cheese fries and coleslaw. The fries were cheesy goodness and the coleslaw was crunchy, tangy and pretty tasty. For a shake, I had a Butter Pecan shake which was totally delish! With every sip, I took in a few pieces of candied type of pecans, which made it all even better. Was I disappointed? Hell no! I was pleased with everything!\n\nAs busy as it was, the service was terrific and attentive,. He often came to the table making sure all was well and always had a full water glass. Will I be back? Whenever I get back to Vegas I will! Its affordable and yummy~! For my husband, me and my lil' girl's kids meal..as well as 2 milkshakes, it was roughly $25. Not bad! We came out of the place well fed and happy!\n\nBTW..every day between 2-4 pm, its happy hour on all shakes! 1/2 off on all shakes! What a deal!"

Pretty sure Steak 'n' Shake doesn't do that.  While it is served on spaghetti much like Cincy-style, even the three way isn't the same.  Steak 'n' shake 3 way - spaghetti, chili and chili sauce.  Cincy-style 3 way - spaghetti, chili, shredded cheese.\n\n2.  Steak 'n' Shake is NOT fast food.  Think of it as more like diner speed.  If you think you're going to come in to eat and be out of there in 20 minutes, you are sadly mistaken.\n\nNow... as far as my most recent visit...  I used the Takhomasack window.  I ordered a Wisconsin Buttery Burger and a strawberry-banana side-by-side.\n\nThe burger - tasty as usual (I get it with raw onions, not sauted onions.  It was about 15 minutes before my order was ready.  It was warm even after driving home (about 5 miles).  BUT... I was sadly a bit disappointed in the shake.  This is easily SnS's strong point, but it was a disappointment.  The consistency was a bit icy... something it should NEVER be.  The fries... were great.  I still prefer shoestring fries over any other kind of fries... and they did not disappoint.  The serving was a bit small, though.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is that this Steak 'n' Shake is not open 24 hours.  EVERY Steak 'n' Shake that I have ever seen (I grew up in Indiana) was open 24 hours.  Why one that is INSIDE A CASINO isn't... is beyond me.\n\n3 stars - it will never get 5 from me due to their operating hours.  The shake knocked another star off this time."

Anyways, we go to South Point quite often when we're in Vegas, and when Steak 'n Shake opened up here a few years back...I knew that I had to try it.  Problem was that the line was always so long no matter what time of the day or night that we passed by.  Finally, got the opportunity to give them a taste two months ago.  While our friends were gambling, wifey and I decided to have a snack here.\n\nWe shared the double cheeseburger combo from their Under $4 menu.  I just checked their website, and the menu is still available.  The double cheeseburger was pretty good.  I would not consider it the freshest and tastiest burger.  It is definitely not a gourmet burger, but it is better than most fast food places (with the exception of In N Out).  The french fries that came with the combo were above average.  I'd have to give the double cheeseburger combo 3 stars.  \n\nOn the other hand, the milkshakes are terrific.  My wife ordered  the Strawberry Banana Shake, and I had the Ultimate Banana Shake.  Wow!  Those two were delicious!  I'd have to say they were one of the best milk shakes that I have ever had.  Okay, I admit that I do not order milkshakes too often.  My wife is more the expert, and she said that she would put them in her top 5.  We both agreed the shakes were worth 5 stars all by themselves.\n\nPaid a total of $16.93  for two shakes and a double cheeseburger combo plus tip.  So, I'd say that the prices are fair. Service was okay, fast, and efficient.  If you do not want to stand in the long waiting line outside in the casino area, then I did notice that they have a section where you could place take out orders. I would get a shake to go and drink it while playing.  Wish they would offer us complimentary milkshakes from Steak 'n Shake while gambling.  I would gamble more here for sure!\n\nHere are my ratings for Steak 'n Shake:\n\nDouble Cheeseburger is 3 stars\nStrawberry Banana Shake is 5 stars\nUltimate Banana Shake is 5 stars\nAmbiance is 4 stars\nService is 3.5 stars\n\nOverall a solid 4 star rating\n\nI would come back to have their milk shakes.  Probably not for the burgers though, unless there is not a long line again the next time we're at South Point."

You will enter by the sports book, go straight back and you'll run into Steak 'n Shake.\n\nThey just recently came out with an app for your phone that gives you a free shake for signing up.

Having grown up in Beef Country and not California, it constantly amazes me how low Californian's and Nevadan's standards are for burgers, poorly cooked fries, and shakes from a machine (like McDonald's) that they line up 20 cars deep to get them.\n\nYes, in a land where Taco Bell wins \"Best Tacos\" in the RJ's poll, In and Out is the Emperor, but it's not easy to see that he is naked.\n\nNow, this location isn't as good as the ones back home that have been open since the '50s, but they do a good enough job when we go. Their constant wait to get a table or place a Takhomasak order is baffling to anyone from an area where SnS locations have drive thrus or carhop service, but it's worth it. I admire the fact that they have the exact same prices and policies as the rest of the chain, including half price drinks during Happy Hour (2-4). There is no \"casino bump\". Want a double steak burger with cheese and fries for $4? Sure thing.\n\nFor the uninitiated, they \"get\" it. That's why they've been in business since 1934. Steak is ground fresh for the burgers. They are served on plates with silverware. Milkshakes are made the right way: by hand and served in tall glasses....MADE FROM GLASS! MILKSHAKES ARE NOT WATERED DOWN ICE CREAM MIX AND SHOULD NOT COME OUT OF A MACHINE!\n\nThat also understand another concept: value. Show me a better deal for a better burger in this town! (Here's a hint-you can't.) nothing on the menu is over $6. Even the top shelf burgers with lots of dressings are $5.75 with fries. Heck, the milkshakes, while approaching the fabled \"five dollar shake mythos, are well deserving of the price difference between them and the dreck from the places where quantity is more important than quality.\n\nOh yeah, then there is the chili, Chili Mac, and rest of the menu. Get chili and cheese on your fries. Totally worth it, since getting here is enough hassle that you won't be doing it often.\n\nThe place is always full when we go, so the wait staff is slammed. Adding things to the initial order might be a bit of an ordeal, so try to get it all in one shot. Shoot for Happy Hour and get the shakes for a stupidly low price of just over $2.\n\nThis isn't an \"ingrained love from growing up on it\" like folks around here have for In and Out. We didn't have one in my hometown. My love for Steak 'n Shake developed after I was an adult.\n\nNot even ordering from the Super Secret Menu can make me understand why people settle for less at the pretender to the throne that's just a stripped down version, founded 15 years after the original."

I have never even heard of Steak n Shake until it opened up here, but I'm glad I know about it now. \nAll I have to say is my new favorite burger EVER is the Wisconsin Buttery. I swear, it's like a party in your mouth! I've tried some of their other burgers, which are all really good, but the Wisconsin buttery, to me, Is total awesomeness. I usually get that and a shake. I like cookie dough myself. \nTheres usually a line during the times people would go out and eat, but it's not that bad. Well worth it to me. And with the prices of food in pretty much every single casino in vegas being high, the prices of the meals at Steak n Shake are a bargain."

It was \"meh\" but it did fill the belly. Especially didnt like the skinny fries. I also ordered the chili for $1.95 and all I got were beans and pepper soup.

The burgers are awesome and the shakes are even better.  \n\nI'm glad I only had to wait 6 months for this one to open.  Since my in-laws are from back East, all I heard every day was \"xx days until opening!\"\n\nNow that I can compare this establishment to the ones back East, I must say the got it close.  Some things are off, but forgivable:\n\n- The employees don't know the menu very well, they don't even know the 'hidden' menu!  My in-law tried ordering something (he worked there when he was a teenager) and they didn't know.\n\n- The food is almost there.  My wife pointed out that somethings were missing or completely off.\n\n- The service and wait was very slow.  Being the only one in town, we have no choice but to wait.  Hopefully it speeds up as the employees pick up.  \n\nOne other nit-pick of mine is that while there is a huge line to get in, they are seating 2 people where you should seat 4 and then the party of 4 has to wait an extra 15-20 minutes.  \n\nMy mandatory selections are: The double 'n cheese burger, The Frisco Melt, The FRIES! and the Shakes.  Don't be afraid to try the seasoning either. It was so good, I bought some to take home with me."

Located in the back of the casino down the other set of stairs/escalators that lead directly into the theater. \n\nOld style diner designed interior to resemble the fast food places like 20-30+ years ago. \n\nMy most recent visit, i had ordered a guacamole steakburger and a cookie dough milkshake. \n\nTheir burgers tend to be smaller then you would expect, but its a decent size. Their fries are a bit thinner than a lot of places but still crispy and good. Add some seasoning and hot sauce (avail on table) and it will be good (applies to both fries and burger) \n\nCookie dough milkshake was good. All the cookie dough kind of sank to the bottom and made it quite sweet XD \n\nSplit checks is easy ! take it to the cashier and they'll split it up for you! The waiter takes order by seat number so it will be split to each person automatically when asked."

We schlepped out to South Point on Friday night to get some shakes, and were surprised by the line.  No big deal, we'll just get our shakes to go.  There's a line inside the restaurant for the take-out counter, and the hostess tells us to get in line outside the doors.  OK, fine... so we wait.  And wait.  And the line doesn't move at all.  After about 15 minutes, my friend finally gets the hostess to talk to him, and she said that it would be at least another 30 minutes until we could order.  WTF?!  Have these people never worked in a take-out situation?  It seemed like they were taking an order, cooking that order, and then charging that order... not taking another order until the prior order was cooked.  I don't get it.  Literally, we saw *one* take-out order leave while we were in that line for 15 minutes.\n\nWe just wanted shakes.  There's no reason in the world why this place is so very disorganized.  We left without our shakes and ended up at Dairy Queen with friendly service.  I miss Steak 'n Shake and will have to visit one in the midwest on my next trip there - and just try to forget that there's a lame attempt at one in the South Point casino in Vegas."

Most of the items were around 6 and they have specials for $3.99. My sister and I split the single steakburger with cheese and bacon. All the sandwiches and dogs come with a side of shoestring fries. Either orders stood out to be as magnificent as I have heard. In fact, what everyone said that night was more accurate. Maybe if I was drunk and needed a cheap burger I would appreciate it more. The toasted bun was more on the hard side. Saw that they pre-toast a pile to keep up with demand. The patties were thin and had little flavor. I also ordered a mint cookies 'n cream milkshake ($3.49). Besides the color, nothing else would hint at mint. It was a good green Oreo shake and not too sweet. Nothing stood out as spectacular, but it is not bad for a cheap bite while at the South Point."

This is the western most location in the U.S. and closest to my hometown in CA. What I like most about Steak n Shake is that it is between a sit down diner like Denny's to a great fast food burger joint like In N Out. The problem with this location is that it is always busy. Both the take-out and dine-in line is always long and I have waited no less than 20 minutes each time. The crazy thing is that I always try to come at off-time hours like 2-4pm. This time while I waited in line I saw that as tables were cleared/cleaned and ready for new customers, it would take the hostess an additional 5-10 minutes to seat people. Often times there were 3 tables empty and it was just a slow hostess. In her defense, I think they are very short staffed at this location and always have too few employees to customers.\n\nAfter 20 minutes we were seated and since I had been here many times, I didn't even need to look at the menu...I knew exactly what I wanted. My server came within 2-3 minutes and said that she would be right with us. It was another 5 minutes before she came. After ordering, the food took another 20 minutes!! The cooks must be short staffed as well!! Between standing in line and getting our food, it was almost 1 hour! I have been to many Steak n Shake locations in the midwest (St. Louis) and have never experienced anything like what I experience at this location.\n\nI ordered my usual Frisco Burger and my brother had the double stack with cheese. I also ordered a Carmel Turtle Shake and a soda to go down with it. If you have never been here before, you need to know that the burger patties are extremely thin. Half the size of In N Out and 1/4 the size of Carl's Jr. If you want a burger that will resemble the amount of food in a Double-Double (from In n Out) then you need to at least order the triple stack burger! The fries that come with the burger are also extremely skinny, which I like, because they are extra crispy! \n\nThe carmel turtle shake came in a large shake glass as usual, but this time there was no excess silver blending cup! When did this change?? Budget Cuts??? You have to get a shake when you come here. It is called Steak n Shake for a reason! \n\nAnother weird thing that I have never experienced before was they kept taking chairs from our table while we were eating. We were two people, seated at a table for four. While we were eating, they took our chair to add to another table. That was fine. Then 5 minutes later they came back and took the other one too! I didn't really care, but it was very odd for them to keep coming back as we are eating. \n\nMy review must sound so negative, but I still gave them 4-Stars, because I still really like the Burgers, Fries and Shakes. In my lifetime I have been to Steak n Shakes over 20 times and I loved it every time! The service here isn't up to par, but I'll still be back the next time i'm in Vegas!"

I was told that this is an East Coast burger chain that is expanding out west slowly to compete with the likes of In n Out.  So I thought I would give it a try to see what it was all about.  The place was really crowded when we got there so we waited in the take-out line which only had 4 people in front of us.\n\nAfter looking over the menu, I decided to go with a triple steakburger with cheese.  It comes with fries and was a little more than $5 which is really cheap.  However, when I picked up my food, I could see why it was cheap - the burger is not as big as I thought it would be and there were less fries than I expected.  Looking past that, I had to try it, and I would have to say that the burger and fries were good.  Does it beat In n Out?  NO.  I do like their burgers and would definitely come back.  Oh, and next time, I think I'll try a shake because they looked really good!"

I have to admit, I'm glad I waited after hearing about the monstrously long lines. \n\nWe arrived around 7:15 and were seated by 7:25, so not too long a wait. My jaw dropped when I opened the menu to see the cheapest prices for a casino burger I've seen in AGES! The prices alone made me love this place.\n\nI decided on the guacamole burger with a very berry strawberry milkshake. My fella got the royale with the cookies n cream milkshake. My dining partners Ryan B. got the western burger with the cookie dough milkshake and Carolyn S. got the trip of shooters with a turtle nut caramel shake. We all absolutely loved and devoured our burgers and shakes. There was a 50/50 split (boys vs. girls) on the fries, with girls in favor of them and the boys against. My fella was swayed over to the girls side after he sprinkled some of the spices on, liberally of course. \n\nOh, and the shakes. The shakes are heaven in a glass. I highly recommend the specialty shakes, especially the fruit options since they have real fruit blended in there, but they were all equally delicious. You can't go wrong here.\n\nA special shout out to the pepper sauce. I mixed some in with my ketchup for an extra zing. \n\nSpecial note: The service was good at first, but once we ordered it was a little difficult to get a hold of our waitress to get refills and more ketchup, but she came back and redeemed herself with lots of refills and plenty of ketchup.\n\nI'm officially a fan and I'll definitely be back."

I had fond memories of the place when I first discovered in in Florida several years ago, and the burning jealousy that later formed once I moved from my home state of Texas only to find that, surprise!  They put one in right after I left.  I tell you, isn't that always the way?\n\nPersonal story aside, I waited and waited until lo, this day has come, and the Steak 'n Shake has landed in Vegas.\n\nI went to the South Point Casino to get my \"Tron Legacy\" tickets when I saw the line.  It was well around the corner.  I just wanted food.  I didn't need to sit at the restaurant.  So I asked if I could do take out.  They promptly sent me to the front of the line as I wasn't needing to wait for a table.  The manager was there and he greeted me warmly.  I guess he knew in his heart of hearts that this was a special day for us all.\n\nI ordered two of the double steak burgers and some \"Buffalo\" style sliders.  The prices were reasonable, all things considered, and the wait wasn't that long.  When I got my bag, the server girl was all friendly and smiles.\n\nSo away I spirited my treasures like how Rumplestiltskin covets....  Well, whatever it is that Rumplestiltskin covets, I was like that, but holding onto my prize even tighter.  As I was leaving, some woman pointed to my bag and said \"Look!  He has Steak 'n Shake!\"  This helped to further my feeling that I was the coolest kid in the casino.\n\nAway I dashed home, eager to eat my steaky, shakey goodness, nibbling their fries all the way home.  I can be a \"fry snob\", but these are tasty.\n\nThen came eating time.  It was like an angel descended from upon high and said onto me: \"You've been a reasonable sort of late.  Here's a hamburger for being so well behaved.  A hamburger... MADE OF STEAK.  Because you are awesome!!!\"  And so, I ate my angel laden steakburger, and was thusly full.\n\nIs it truly that amazing?  Honestly, I'd give it a four star experience, but the service was so helpful and friendly, I'm giving this place a five star experience.  My enthusiasm for being there \"Day 1\", coupled with the wait made it a fun and tasty experience.\n\nTomorrow I go see \"Tron\".  I'm also going back to Steak 'n Shake before the movie starts.\n\nCould the day get any better?"

In fact, the burgers came out before our drinks!!! \n\nOn to my Royale. When I took the lid off, it looked like a crippled piece of midget bacon gave birth to another crippled piece of midget bacon. I don't mean to offend crippled or little people, but it's just looked like someone broke off 2 pieces of bacon from a normal strip of bacon n put it in my burger. \n\nNaturally I complained (I love bacon) and the server brought me a heaping helping of bacon on the side. That more than made up for it. My moms guacamole steak burger miraculously turned into a guacamole double bacon steak burger. Hahaha. My mom said her burger was good. I thought my burger was good, but I could tell it was sitting there for a while. The egg n patties in my burger was cold. But it still tasted delicious. Probably because it's the first meal I had all day and I just got done working out. \n\nThe chili cheese fries were ok. The chili isn't that great but I love the melted cheese sauce. \n\nOn to dessert. As I am writing this review, I am consuming my delicious mint Oreo shake. Good ending to my meal.

Perfectly mixed (not runny but not so thick you have to wait to drink it). \n\nEverything on the menu is reasonably priced (4 bucks for a HUGE triple burger and fries, \"shooters\" for 89 cents apiece) You will spend a little LESS than you would spend eating at McDonald's and get food that is 100x as good. Not to mention, during the week they have a Happy Hour from 2-4pm where shakes are half price.\n\nMy one and only complaint is that the location isnt 24 hours. Im hoping that this will be changed soon because I know for a fact they would be slammed at any hour of the day now that the word is out.\n\nSo glad to have SnS in Vegas!"

I got a boring single cheeseburger with everything on it, and I scarfed it down.  The bun and the meat were so soft and so good.  I liked that the patty was pretty thin.  Most of their special burgers come with 2 patties.  The fries were good even though I don't prefer shoestring fries. \n\nThe onion rings were really good and crispy, the food arrived pretty quickly, the waitress was very helpful (Kaz or Karen), the chili 3 way (on spaghetti) was good, too.   They also sell chili in cans to go for $2.99 each.  The vanilla coke was also perfect - not too much syrup.  \n\nThe others in our group tried the Chipotle burger, Buttery Wisconsin and the one with a fried egg in it.  They all were happy. \n\nThere's also a separate \"To Go\" line."

I always go with the option that comes on rye. It also comes with fries that I disliked a lot. They are tiny and mine weren't too fresh. Double bummer.\n\nThe patty melt was pretty good, and I added bacon for 99 cents, but for $9 it's a bit pricey. The sandwich needed more sauce to jack up the flavor.  It was an OK enough meal, but they have $4 meal deals that aren't on the menu that I should have tried instead. It did not live up to my expectations for an amazing patty melt!"

The burgers are fine for what you pay for them, which come with comically thin fries on the side. But the star here is definitely the selection of milkshakes. I am a fan of the cookies and cream and the banana chocolate flavors, the latter made with real banana. Another favorite is getting a side order of beans, which come in a ceramic jar and inevitably have a yummy tomatoey film on the top of them. I'm a little disappointed at the scrapping of the kids menu, but the food is so cheap here, that it won't break the bank to get a regular portion instead."

I ordered the jalape\u00f1o crunch steak burger with Parmesan fries. The burger was delicious except it wasn't crunchy! I think the oil from the burger made the fried onions really soggy but it was still very yummy. My mom ordered the grilled chicken salad & we were impressed with how massive the salad was. My dad ordered the portobello and Swiss steak burger with salt & vinegar fries. The salt & vinegar fries were amazing, it made my Parmesan fries taste really bland lol. I also ordered one classic strawberry milkshake which was really good, & I'm not a huge fan of milkshakes. It wasn't too sweet and the consistency wasn't too thick either which made it very easy to drink unlike other milkshakes that just get jammed in the straw. \n\nOverall, they have good burgers, amazing shakes & great prices.

I've stayed at SouthPoint several times, and all of the restaurants are good, with one notable exception - Steak and Shake. I guess this is some kind of chain, but I don't see where they get off using the word 'steak' to describe anything about the food. The service is equally bad. To sum things up, just stay away!\n\nLet's start with service. Hostess was rude, took us to a table, we requested a booth instead (2 were open), her response was \"you should've told me before!\" There was no sign and she should have asked or at least tried to accommodate us... So we sat at the table and finally got service (it took a good while - honestly I didn't count/clock it). After being asked to repeat ourselves, the server went off to place the order. The whole staff seemed downtrodden with the exception of the register attendant, who asked me if everything was to my liking, but I couldn't break it to her... \n\nFood... Paper-thin, overdone patty; decent veggies; bun was soggy... Just too gross to eat. Fries were also soggy and underdone, but ok to eat. I also had a milkshake that almost passed as decent except for the strange whip cream and cherry job. The cherry was flattened and whip cream was strangely distributed. Looked like a 5 year old made it. I've had better at fast food chains. My partner had a chicken salad which looked good - I'd get that if forced to go back.\n\nAtmosphere... Lots of screaming children. If you like Johnny rockets, you might like the decor. Mostly clean. Downtrodden staff.\n\nThe food is relatively cheap, but it's just bad. If you want something cheap, there's a hot dog cart on the casino floor that sells 75 cent hit dogs. Coronado cafe is also a better option; spend a little extra, get so much more! If you're feeling nostalgic, get the hot dog anyway because the food here is gross, the staff was either rude or downtrodden, and tons of screaming children. Just 'NO!'"

There was a line to get seated but it went quick and service was very fast also! \n\nI loved the selection of burgers and have to agree with my friend that the food is delish. The shakes were also to die for here -- splurge and you won't regret it.

We found the site for the South Point Casino and saw a link for the Steak n Shake. It looked interesting and we made plans to make that one of our destinations for a meal.\n\nAfter a long day at the Consumer Electronics Show we got to South Point which is on the Las Vegas Strip but a ways from the main casinos (Luxor, MGM, etc). It was a nice looking casino with many choices for dining. When we got to the Steak n Shake there were about three couples ahead of us waiting for tables on a very long couch near the entrance.\n\nThe hostess told us we had to wait behind a rope area but there was plenty of room on the couch for us to finally sit down so I took a seat. I was very tired and a little pissed that we were told to wait behind a rope when others were allowed to sit but I also knew I was very tired and the hostess probably didn't mean it the way I heard it.\n\nThen we got to our table. The prices at this place were incredible. A single burger and fries was the same price as a double and a triple was only fifty cents more. I tried to ask the hostess and our waiter if there were size difference in the burgers (other than patty count) and no one would answer me.\n\nThe waiter dropped out silverware on the table, blew off my question and went to another table. Then went he came back I asked my menu questions and he was very rude in his answers. I kept thinking that because I was so wiped out that maybe I was being too sensitive about his service but it never got better.\n\nWhen he brought our food I asked for steak sauce but he ignored me and went to another table without acknowledging our drink situation or if we needed anything else. I asked my girlfriend if it was just me or was this guy horrible?\n\nI finally got his attention and told him I would appreciate a little better service, especially if he expected a tip. He brought my steak sauce and then we never saw him again. Not on the floor, not behind the counter, he was gone. Break time? I guess we didn't need refills on our drinks.\n\nWhen I went up to pay the check the cashier asked if everything was ok and I told her our waiter was a jerk. She said his name was Alex and indicated she had received other complaints. So I felt better that it wasn't just me that was imagining bad service.\n\nOver all I liked the food and atmosphere of the place. It was very busy and the prices were more that reasonable. In fact I would say the prices were too low for what we got. I would have paid double anywhere else. \n\nWould I return for a second visit? Yes as long as Alex was no where to be seen. The guy does not belong any where around people. I hope management for the South Point Casino and the Steak n Shake see this review and moves Alex to housekeeping for the hotel.\n\nThis place would have gotten four stars without Alex."

Well, thats wonderful because I'm glad I ain't always the one trying to dine somewhere new! \n\nThis place is located in my favorite Vegas Casino, South Point! I just really like the ambiance in this place and I won my first and only (so far!) Royal Flush here!! Enough of the small talk,  we got here starving and had to go in the \"To Go\" line since it was about 5 times shorter than the \"For Here\" line!!! Yes, the line was sooo looooooonnnnnggg, that at first I thought they were giving away free burgers or something??!!\n\nAfter about 10 minutes in line and then another 15 minutes to pick-up, this is what we literally inhaled:\n\nMy order:\n\nWisconsin Buttery Steakburger and Fries: I love butter, probably as much as Paula Dean does.. Maybe?! Wisconsin butter, never had that before.. I'll take one of those! Wow! I've never tasted anything like it before. First off their meat was unique to my taste buds but without a doubt one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had - in a small package! The butter, sloth of onions and their meat just.. just made me happy!\n\nWestern BBQ 'N Bacon Steakburger and Fries: I always love this type of burger. Now, their take on this one was humbly satisfying. I mean its their meat that sets them apart, its thin and cooked well yet not dry at all. Edges are purposely crisped on some sides and it just adds another positive attribute to the burger.. the slightly crunchy onion rings, a bit sweet/tangy bbq sauce and cheese all together made me an instant fan off one bite! \n\nFries (Skinny and Crunchy): I did have 2 orders of fries and I did demolish both of them with ease, along with the burgers! The fries may had been skinny and crunchy but they were perfectly cooked where there was still some evident soft potato meat in each fry. \n\nMy Fiance's order:\n\nSpicy Chipotle Steakburger and Fries: I saw here unwrap it and literally within a minute and half at most, the thing vanished!! I knew she was hungry but dayum! She ate that thing like I was gonna snag it from her! She did say \"That was the Best Burger I've ever had. My Grandma used to make me something that tasted just like this Meat when I was young. It brought me back to that time. I want another one!\"\n\nCONS:\n- Ridiculously Long Line and Wait\n- Burgers were sized for light eaters\n\nPROS:\n- The Burgers tasted Unexpectedly Outstanding\n- Prices were Inexpensive \n- Atmosphere made me wanna ' Eat Steak 'N Shake, RATTLE and ROLL!!'"

It's located inside South Point... kind of far from the strip. You can either take Las Vegas Blvd all the way down or hop on the I-15S and get off at Silverton if you are on the way back to LA or just exit Silverton from I-15N if you are heading to Vegas. \n\nMy friend raved about this place, stating how much she missed it and that it was pretty  much all she missed about Indiana! She ordered 4 for the road... I just ordered one burger and one order of chicken strips for the drive home. I must say, prices are cheap!! The royale was about $5 and included fries. A royal comprised of a double patty, an egg, and bacon... and it was greasy goodness. The patties are charbroiled and have a crispy edge. I would say go for the double because a single is really thin and the meat to bun ratio will mean too much bun. The chicken strips and fries were $4 and it came with 3 strips and fries... I had 4 strips however, but I think it's because 2 were smaller. The fries are the thin shoestring one and they have seasoned fries too for an extra 29 cents. I opted for the salt and pepper and the garlic parmesan. I would go for the garlic parmesan again. \n\nI don't know if I would go off the strip for them as I don't like to be off the strip when I'm in Vegas... however it is a good option when you're coming in/out of Vegas. It's very casual and diner style here. You can either eat in or go to the take out window to order. \n\nI'm def a fan of this place and am glad my friend introduced me to something new and not native to California. My friend said the shakes are also really good. I read there there is happy hour where the drinks are half off! All single patty burger with fries are $4 and the specialty ones are different prices. I think the highest I saw was probably $6. Food here is very cheap. Try it! If you don't like it, at least it didn't cost a lot of money!"

First off, Steak and Shake has the feel of a 50's diner. So right off the bat it is a fun place to go and hang out. No servers on roller skates though, darn. The menu is primarily Burgers, Dogs, Chili and Shakes. There is more, but that is what most of the menu is. The burgers are made of Sirloin Steak. The patties are about 2oz each. So they are thin and have a bit of crunch at the outer edge. The burgers are served medium well. This is a very good burger. The fries are part way between a shoestring and regular sized fry. They have a nice flavor and a good crunch because of their thickness.\n\nThe shakes are hand scooped. The combinations of shake flavors is almost limitless. The thing about the shakes that I like the most is that they are twice a large as you would expect them to be. They taste great and have a very creamy\ntexture. They are also chilled nicely and hit the spot.\n\nThe service is fast. They get to your table quickly. They bring the food quickly. The tables are cleared quickly. The only issue I had was that I did not see many smiles on the workers faces. A few, but most did not. You can make the assumptions you want to make about that yourself."

Our food came out ridiculously fast, less than 10 minutes after ordering. \n\nI ordered a single burger with fries and it was the perfect amount of food for me. It was also delicious for a fast burger. The prices here are also laughably low. \n\nThis is a solid spot for a burger and shake for cheap."

We had some comp dollars to burn and for some reason both Baja Miguel's and Primarily Prime Rib had 45 minute waits to be seated.  Hell, even the Coronado diner and their terrible buffet had a wait.  \n\nSOOOOOOO..welcome to \"plan E\".  \n\nWe opted for the takeout line and to eat at one of the booths by the sportsbook.  Still had to wait about 20 minutes for our order.  The shakes the servers kept walking by us with looked freakin awesome but I didn't feel like drinking 800 calories and 70g of fat.  \"Save it for the burger\" I told myself. \n\nFinally sit down ready to eat and were pretty disappointed at what dinner looked like.  It didn't get any better after the first bite.  The patties were thin and dry and the fries had no seasoning on them.  What a total waste of calories and fat.  Whoppers taste a million times better than this.    \n\nWhat the hell am I missing??  Why would anyone spend an hour in line for this crap let alone 20 minutes?  Where is the STEAK in Steak n' Shake?  I'd rather eat frozen chicken nuggets."

When the food came I still did not have my shake. He comes back with it and it was good, but runny from being ready for awhile. My burger was so good. Probably a new favorite burger place of mine actually! My waiter jacked up my toppings, but I didn't say anything. It was so darn tasty it didn't matter really. I also loved the fries.

As soon as we saw the sign advertising it on the 15 freeway, we knew no matter what, we had to make a trip to this place that's relatively off the Strip. \n\nSo how deeply am I in love with their food? Well, for once, I downed two burgers plus shake in a sitting and took one more to go. When Andrew went to Vegas a week later, I had him bring back to Los Angeles two more burgers for me. Obsessed? I think so. =)\n\nThe first burger up was the Wisconsin Buttery Steakburger. I'm not a big fan of onions, but I gobbled up the entire burger, onions included in no time. The two Steakburger patties were not overcooked (just perfect!) and the melted butter and cheese made the nice connecting bridge from the meat to the toasted bun. Addictingly good. Only downside is no green veggies.\n\nBeing a guacamole/avocado freak, I had to order the Guacamole Steakburger (pass on the raw onions) next. The guacamole is freshly made and smothered over the two meat patties. Adding in a couple of the thin and crispy fries that come with the meal is a fantastic idea! Another great burger.\n\nThe strawberry classic milkshake was thick, creamy, and oh so good! Very much so a classic. Now that I got that down, I'm up to try their side by side shakes, where you can pick two flavors to combine in one glass. Imagine the yummy possibilities!\n\nI have to praise our server for being so wonderful and patient. After being seated, we had ordered only two burgers up front even though we knew we would consume more. We didn't want the second order of burgers to go cold while we were inhaling the first, so we ordered the second ones later. Then, we added in our shake orders. Thirdly, after having three different versions of our receipt, we added in our burgers to go. Really, kudos to our server for being flagged so often to add something in and to change our receipt.\n\nAs a testament (what, my review wasn't enough??? =]) to the amazing food at Steak 'n Shake, lines to get a table in the restaurant run about 45 minutes, maybe more if on a weekend. They don't call numbers or put down your name and party size, so you feel like you are in line for a theme park attraction. At least at the end of this line, instead of a 2 minute coaster ride, you get 30+ minutes of deliciously joy!"

Or I guess it wasn't what I remember it to be. The 2 things that I do love about this burger place is the flat Pattys and the price. \n\nThe Resturant itself at the South Point location is always busy. There is a line out the door and a minimum of 15-20 minute wait sometimes you might get lucky but I'm never lucky. The other option is their togo window which is awesome because you cut your wait time in half. \n\nThe dinner is super cool and modern 50's out the servers all wear hats and bow ties and instead of paper napkin you get cloth towels. They have huge booths to sit 6 or large tables for big groups and most of the time the people there are friendly. \n\nThe party melt is my favorite anywhere and it is here. I love the thin beef Pattys and skinny fries. No they are not low fat they are just super skinny like straw almost. You also have to choice of 4 season fries Cajun, Salt and vinegar, Parmesan herb or sea salt and crack pepper. All of them are awesome. You also can do cheese fries I am a stickler for chili and theirs is ok not bad just too much  beans for me. I love greasy meaty chili. Anyways and the other thing is we ordered a shake thinking it would come in one of those cool old schools shake glasses because it's part of the experience right? Nope it was in a togo cup boo! \n\nFoods good prices are just a few misses here and there. A place you have to try if you never have just not a place I will run to."

The first visit, we had an awesome waitress with a great personality.  Now, I don't expect everyone to be like her, but the second time, the most of the crew seemed to be inattentive and lacked customer service skills.  The second visit, we stood at the podium for a little bit, and someone approached, but never looked at us or said anything, then walked away.  The person who I assumed was the hostess arrived thereafter, didn't greet us in anyway - just grabbed menus, mumbled something incomprehensible (which I assumed was a cue to follow her), then seated us.  We waited a while before the server arrived even though there seemed to be a number of servers working, several of whom appeared to be socializing near the kitchen.  Fortunately, our server turned out to be one of only two  that seemed to be on the ball that night.  Maybe I was just let down because the first experience was so good, service-wise.\n\nNonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the food both times!  And even though the service did now wow me the second time, the food did come out very quickly once we placed our order.  The first visit I had a hamburger, fries, and a turtle caramel nut shake.  The steakburger and fries (don't forget the special seasoning!) were enjoyable, but I swear that shake was the best I've had in my entire life!  I was in complete heaven.\n\nThe second visit, I ordered a guacamole steak frank with fries, and a shake (I can't remember which shake I had this visit).  Thoroughly enjoyed the steak frank!\n\nI'll definitely return here during my next Vegas visit!"

There is one such location in Las Vegas, and it is inside of South Point Hotel Casino and Spa. More specifically, it is seemingly located on the other end of the casino floor from the Silverado Ranch side w/ the parking garage and parking lot that I typically use when parking at South Point\n\nI walked straight into the restaurant, which is a diner, but the perceptive employee at the register guessed correctly that I was more interested in takeout and directed me to the small counter on the side that serves such a purpose. I probably wouldn't have missed grabbing a seat, but I was on a bit of a time crunch, so that suited my purposes.\n\nIt felt like it took at least 7 minutes to get my order with four people ahead of me, which is on the slow end. I got the standard Double Steakburger with cheese and fries ($3.99), which I obtained for free as a result of redeeming my birthday coupon (e-mail signup in advance required).\n\nThe shoestring fries tasted a little underseasoned at first but grew on me as I snacked on them while walking out to my car. They have just enough crunch when eaten fresh, and they are surprisingly addictive even without any ketchup. They're the most similar to McDonald's out of all the fast food fries that I can think of.\n\nThe burger was actually good. It's pretty average in size as compared to a typical fast food burger. The bun is fluffy and seems to be toasted. The patties are about as thick (or thin) as you'll find at most burger chains. The meat inside the patty is as gray as a rain cloud, but it actually didn't taste dry, perhaps owing to the cheese sandwiched between the patties or to the liquid condiments. I got the burger with everything, which means one slice of American cheese, tomato, lettuce, pickles, onions, ketchup, mayo, and mustard. It was lacking in sweetness per my preference despite the ketchup.\n\nI can name at least four other burger chains in town that I'd rather visit, but I can't justify a lower rating when I was pretty happy with the entire meal. Steak 'n Shake is worth an annual trip if it's not out of your way, or even a quick stop if a burger craving hits and you're already at South Point."

My husband was familiar with it since the chain advertised on some of the channels that aired all the baseball games. Plus he had heard from a good friend, that it was really good. We came here recently to celebrate my husband's birthday and went to a movie afterwards. \n\nThe place looks like a 1950's diner (the murals adorning the walls from the 1950's probably helped, too), with the staff wearing traditional black and whites (does it sound too fancy for a burger joint?). There is a line for sit-down service- about a twenty minute wait (this is the only location in the city, so expect it). (Come to think of it, there is a line for the takeout window as well.) The staff is very nice. \n\nBesides the specialty burgers, there are a few chicken sandwiches and a couple salads. The prices are on average about $7.00 and less for combo meals, per person. We came here with my father-in-law and his wife. Everyone ordered burgers and I ordered a chicken sandwich (I know it sounds funny, but that's me). My sandwich was good, but I might actually try the sliders next time (curiosity), plus I know that the meat is really tender too. My husband said it was probably the best burger he had, but that it's also hard to compare it to the others (red robin, islands, ruby tuesday) since there isn't anything else like it. Oh and for the heat lovers, there is a bottle of peppers on the table. (There are bottles of seasoning and peppers for sale, for those of you you want to take it home.) The burgers are fully cooked, so you know (my husband usually likes it medium). \n\nThe other star of the restaurant is the selection of milkshakes. I chose the banana-chocolate (\"side by side\"- I know it's a weird concept to grasp) and it was really yummy. I would order that flavor again even though (it was that good) there are so many other flavors to choose from, like chocolate, vanilla (my FIL got this one), and cookies and creme (my hubby chose this one). Seriously, there are so many flavors- something for everyone, really. The average cost of a milkshake was $4.00. If you are ordering one for take-out, know that the size is significantly smaller, than if you are dining in- food for thought. \n\nI am not surprised that the place is super popular and crowded (the twenty minute wait is a small price to pay). It's reasonable (almost like fast food prices), original (ground steak burgers), and everything is really good. Sometimes when you hear about a place, you have these high expectations, and then you're let down. But that didn't happen here. We are coming here again soon (this weekend), and I can hardly wait. I'm getting that shake again!"

After a 30 minute wait for a table and a prompt greeting by our waitress, everything quickly slid downhill.\n\nOur order took forever to make it to our table, and only one of our four meals was brought to our table as ordered.  One burger was missing bacon and was sent back (kitchen error).  One was the wrong item entirely and was sent back (waitress error).  I had ordered a salad (pretty much the only vegetarian item available on the menu) and it took an extra 5 minutes to make it to the table, and at least another 5 to get salad dressing.  My wife ended up eating about 15 minutes later when her chicken sandwich was finally served.\n\nThe poor service might have been balanced by exceptional food quality, but that was not the case.  The food was fine, but far from exceptional.  My wife rated her chicken sandwich a 2 (out of 10) while my children's burgers did better at 6-7.  My salad was good, but clearly not the reason one would go to this restaurant.  Considering the wait and the poor service, the food was not good enough for us to return to this chain again.\n\nOn the plus side, my son had a mocha shake that was very good.\n\nConsidering the delays and mistakes, one would have expected the manager to at least comp the chicken sandwich that was delivered so late. And he did, but only after we called the manager over to our table and let him know that this was what we expected.  Then we had to explain it to the cashier.  Who had to call the manager over.  Who needed to key it into the register. Twice because the cashier made a mistake keying in the amount tendered.\n\nAltogether a grueling experience.\n\nADDENDUM:\nCredit to the management for getting in touch with me after reading my feedback. They seemed genuinely concerned about our negative experience and assured me that this was not typical, and that the issues that I raised would be addressed and corrected. Two points to Steak 'n Shake for good follow-thru!"

The hostess pointed at the TAKEOUT window & said \"there's take out right over here\" which triggered my attention.\nAnthony or tony was out server. Service was fine at first. My friend had spilled water before the food came. Instead of tony offering to clean it up. He just threw napkins down & never tried to clear the glass or ice left on the table. \nUpon paying, we were the last to leave. The lady (cashier) seemed to have the biggest attitude because we wanted to split the check 3 ways for 6 people. As she noticed I took a \"how was your visit\" slip in front of her. She quickly took down her name tag & started being nice. Didn't give us receipts & when we did ask for it; she asked why. What?!!! Are you joking. Terrible staff. I get it it's NEW YEARS DAY.

Since our first visit, we've been there a handful of times and the trip out there seems to be less worth it each time. Maybe I'm crazy but it seems like the burgers get thinner and smaller every time we go. I tried the Jalapeno Crunch burger during a recent visit  a few weeks ago and I was extremely disappointed. The meat was dry, the bun was dry and the toppings just didn't meet the flavor they portray on the menu. My wife got her usual which is the Wisconsin Buttery burger and even she questioned that visit. Maybe it was just a bad night? If that's the case, they are having a run of bad nights when we visit. \n\nWe ate at Steak 'n Shake again last evening with some family and it was just disappointment again. The food comes out dry, the fries are flavorless without the seasoning and their service is terrible. Our waitress confused some of our items with the table beside us, brought some of the wrong items and was just overall slow and rude. I don't know about others but I hate having to waive down a waitress for a drink refill on a cup that's been empty for the duration of my meal. If you see that your tables cups are empty or very close to empty when you bring out the food, you should automatically be working on refills or at minimum, asking if the customer would like a refill.\n\nIn my opinion, Steak 'n Shake only deserves 3 stars for these two reasons...the chili and the price. Their chili is amazing! It's meaty, flavorful and they always bring it out nice and hot, piled with cheese and onions (if you like it that way). Every time we visit, we grab a few cans to take home. If you ask me, it's some of, if not the best chili in town. And their prices are great! You can easily walk out of their for under $25 with 3 people. We will definitely go back but they need to work on quality control and customer service."

When we arrived, there was a line, on a Sunday, at 3pm!!!  It was moving pretty fast so yay!  we were hungry.\n\nSpicy Chipotle Burger-Was good.  The chili cheese fries were good too.\n\nFrisco Patty Melt with fries-Decent.  I missed the Patty Melt at Waffle House back in Houston Texas.  When I saw this on the menu, I had to order it.  Because I recently learned that I like sourdough, this was the choice I had to make.  After I bit into it, I realized that maybe I would enjoy it more if it was the regular patty melt.  I like it with mayo and pickles.  This one had a chipotle sauce on it, and I prefer my mayo.  When I requested for 6 slices of pickles, the waitress came back with exactly 6 as I request.  She listened to my request even though she was very busy\n\nTurtle Milk Shake-SINFUL!!!  The caramel and hot fudge as a thick layer on creamy milky vanilla shake, topped with whipped cream, some pecans and a maraschino cherry was soooo delicious.  My friend finished his burger and milkshake, was super full, but offered to help me with my turtle milkshake.  I politely said NO.  I didn't finish my patty melt or fries, but I sure did finish this milk shake. \n\nPecan Milk Shake-This was good, but not as good as my Turtle Milk Shake!\n\nI have to say this is a good deal.  More bang for your buck.  But since this isn't the healthiest thing out there, my next visit will probably be at least in another 2 months."

So if your looking for more meat, try ordering a double or even a triple steakburger. \n\nI personally am not a fan of the shoe string French fry, but when paired with chili bowl there OK.  \n\nThe chili is very yummy I give it 5 stars ( the main reason I eat here) its a bean and meat chili, very simple and tasty.  \n\nAnd my boyfriend loves the shakes, the reason he eats here with me.\n\nI grew up in the Midwest and this is a traditional steak n shake,  they haven't changed the menu for the west.  So, I can understand disappointment when going for a burger and it looking much smaller than most burger joints.  This is just how they do.  And I'm hoping by leaving this post, before you eat at steak n shake you don't go in expecting a thick burger.  \n\nIf you want a more flavor burger, try a Frisco melt ( very popular where I'm from ) or something with more sauces, toppings.  \n\nHope my input helped.  \n\nChili bowl fan - ;)"

We were waiting around for a party to start and decided that we would come here since we were both kind of hungry. \n\nWhen we turned the corner to where the Steak N' Shake was, we were greeted by a tremendous line. My boyfriend looked at me and said, \"oh hell no.\" But I remember that you could get things to go, so I told him that we should just do that and go eat it somewhere in the casino. We went up to the hostess and told her we're just getting something to go and she let us right in. \n\nThere was only one person in front of us in the togo line, which was awesome. We knew there would be food at the party, so we decided we'd just get a little snack. That little snack turned out to be a Chili Cheese steak frank, Guacamole steak frank, 2 sides of fries, and 2 large sodas.  \n\nWe only waited for 5 minutes tops. I told my bf to make sure they put the seasoning on the fries because I didn't want to miss out on that. He checked the bag and sure enough, they didn't. We went back and asked the lady at the counter for some seasoning and she said they didn't have any. WTF? Umm, they were only open for a few weeks at this point. No seasoning...really? There was a whole mountain of seasoning for sale right next to us and she said they didn't have any. We ended up walking to another woman at the counter and asking; she gave it to us right away. \n\nSince we got our food to go, we had to find somewhere to eat it. We ended up sitting at the little food court area where the ice cream and coffee place is. There were a few other people doing the same thing, so we didn't attract too much attention. \n\nWe opened up out hotdog containers and dug in. Both of our hotdogs were delicious! Combined with the fries, this meal definitely hit the spot! We probably ate everything in about 5 minutes. I don't know why, but the food just tasted so much better than the first time we came here. \n\nAll in all, 4 stars for the food and speedy service, minus one star for the \"lack\" of seasoning."

Some people grew up with it in the Midwest and miss it. I've only had SnS a couple of times. But that first time, it was late, I was a little drunk, I had never heard of SnS before, and I thought it was the greatest sandwich I had ever eaten.\n\nFast forward to today. Based on that one memory, I had been anticipating SnS's opening for several months. I went on \"opening day\" (based on the press release anyway) and endured the 30-minute line. Did it live up to the hype? Yes and no. I mean, how could it? I still think the best items at SnS are pretty damn good. There are also items that are pretty meh (I experienced this blahness the second time I ate SnS).\n\nOn this visit, I ordered the A-1 Peppercorn Melt w/ Fries. For the heck of it, I decided to add one of their Steakburger shooters w/ Chipotle sauce. And of course, I had to get a shake. I went with a Banocolate - a combination of banana and chocolate.\n\nThe melt was very good. It was the kind of sandwich that reminded me of that first mythical time eating SnS. The shooter was an example of meh. Not ordering one of those again. As for the shake, just like its flavors, I'm a little mixed on it. For me, the novelty of the half and half shake has worn off. The banana strangely overpowered the neighboring chocolate. Next time, I think I'll get a straight malt. Speaking of which, my cousin got a Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Malt. I tried it. It was good. But I was a little disappointed in its lack of \"maltiness.\"\n\nBy the way, our server, Luciane, was attentive and very friendly. This is to be expected on opening day. She was perhaps a little too attentive. She kept asking how everything was before we had even tried.\n\nIf you're not a die hard SnS fan, you might want to wait a couple of weeks for the lines to die down. Bottom line: I'm still a fan and I'm glad they're here."

I know my burgers, beef or chicken, and traditional chicken sammies. \n\nNot sure why I come here, all 3 visits have been the same: just awful. I really wish I knew why this place is popular because I don't see it.  Maybe because the food is cheap. It certainly makes me question what people's standards are when it comes to food - this place is just disgusting. \n\nI ordered a chicken sandwich, a BLT, & cheeseburger. Chicken is dry, so it would catch in my throat & every bite had to be washed down with Coke. (There wasn't anything fresh about my meal that's for certain.)Needless to say my drink needed constant refills...oh wait, my server never offered to fill my cup during her 2 second stopover.  BLT was a joke. \"where's the bacon?\"  Burger...overcooked, no flavor; cheese was obviously processed. Fries looked great but weren't. Portions of each were small, not that it mattered. I wouldn't take a doggie bag home for my dogs from this place if you paid me. \n\nFood is cheap, from price to quality of ingredients & its obvious.

From my take, Steak n' Shake has a cult following similar to how our local Californian's dig our beloved In N' Out burger.\n\nWe had attempted to eat here once before during a previous stay, but the line was \"super\" long, & we were \"super\" drunk. Feeling a bit too \"super\", we continued our blackjack binge before getting something to eat out on the strip, I think?\n\nThen during our last visit, we finally made it our goal to eat here despite the hr. long wait. We lost track of time, given we were in Vegas,but I believe it was late afternoon. \n\nThe decor has a rockin' 50's theme w/ checkered tiling, pictures of curly haired Peggy Sue's drinking shakes, & tunes from Fats Domino, Elvis, etc. Once we were seated, we were taken care of immedietely. \n\nI ordered the original cheesy cheddar steak burger along w/ shoestring fries, & a bowl of chili while Diane had their chili spaghetti. The burger itself was delicious. It didn't wow me the way I expected, but it has quality ingredients, fresh produce, & felt like it was made with love. Fries were salty & tasty, but my favorite part of my meal was their chili. That really hit the spot. Diane's chili spaghettie was delicious as well, had a good portion to it & the noodles were on point. \n\nThe prices here are pretty cheap for what you'd expect. We paid around $17.50ish for our meal I believe which is not bad at all. My only dissapointment about this location is that it isn't 24 hrs. like the original in Indiana. You would think because it's Vegas & they would make a killing doing so, but it is what it is. Come check em' out!"

(LOL I actually timed it on my iphone since people were saying we would have to wait an hour)\n\nThe place is mighty small- one good reason why there is such a long wait besides the place being new and inviting.\nOur server Lisa was nice and informative.  I ordered the CHEDDAR CHEESY DOUBLE STEAKBURGER.  $1 more than the regular CHEESE STEAKBURGER.  The only reason it was a dollar more was cuz it was \"WISCONSIN CHEDDAR CHEESE\"--oooooooh!  \nWe also ordered some ONION RINGS which was ok.  (the onion rings at my job's cafeteria is sooo much better)  The ranch sauce was weak and the honey/mustard looked like chipotle with thousand island...anyways.\nMy son's sliders...looked weak but it filled him up and he did like the taste. My mom ordered the MUSHROOM STEAKBURGER and I guess she liked it since she drowned it in the ranch sauce we got with the onion rings.\nOur coca-colas were yum and came in a coca-cola glass.  I got the CHERRY COKE, son got VANILLA COKE and moms got the DIET COKE. \nThe fries were as small and skinny as the ones at MC Donalds but not as tasty and kinda crispier.  \n\nOf course we had to order some shake to go to make the experience complete. By this time it was shift change and Lisa had to leave us.  (So we made sure she got her tip)\nThe shift change was at 6pm but our next server did not even show up at our table til 6:20pm.  I was feeling bad for the people in line knowing they are starving and waiting for that long-awaited experience to taste the STEAKBURGER.\nWe finally got our shake order in and had to wait another 10 min.  The guy clearing the table was much more friendlier (I think his name is Jerick) he explained to us that they only had two blenders which can only handle 4 shakes at a time. \nMy shake MINT something was delish and yummy.  My son did not really like his which was STRAWBERRY BANANA.  \n\nNow my review on the burger:::::It was juicy and tasted good.  The cheddar cheese....umm..I could have been happy with the regular cheese.  I did not add any salt or anything else so I can actually taste the meat.  It did taste fresh and the double burger probably equaled one thick burger.  The bread was nice but the lettuce was just a flimsy leaf they threw on the burger.  It was not greasy (unlike the Johnny Rockets burgers) and I actually finished my burger without grossing out at the end.  The price is great for a sit-down spot. \n\nMy advise to newbies: Try it and check it out on off hours.  If there is a long line....well....your choice.  LOL.\n\nBONUS:  if you spend $15 you get a free COKE GLASS.  We got two free glasses since we spent $31.  (I should have played thosed numbers since we waited 31min 31seconds and the bill was $31dollars.  \n\n*****I hope my review was worth your read********"

There is a lack of seating although waits can be upwards of an hour, and lastly just that there are no \"chances\" taken with their fare.

Even on a Sunday night. So, I decided to just get the food to go, which was still a long line. Prob a 10 min wait to go place an order then prob another 5-7min to get the food. \n\nI ordered the original double cheesburger, fries, and mint cookies n cream shake. The burger was good but nothing special. And small. I should've ordered a triple AT LEAST. fries were super skinny and just ok. the best part of the meal was the mint shake. had i known what the burger and fries were like i wouldve just gotten the shake and got food somewhere else. the shake was super good and filling. good stuff. \n\nquality and price do not match up at all, thats why i knocked off stars. i payed $10.50 for a double cheeseburger, fries, and a shake. my meal was def was not worth that much. overpriced for the size/amount of food you actually get. it prob to me shouldve just been worth $7 total. the burger was tiny and fries to match. \n\nI SAY, GO HERE FOR THE SHAKES ONLY."

Their waitstaff was pretty slow (Edward!), so I understand their desire to not overload the waiters.\n\nI was expecting it to be $13 per burger because of the pictures in the menu (HUGE burgers!), but prices were low and the burgers were also haha.  The BF and I together only spent $16 for a satisfying meal!  We both got upgraded sides (chili cheese fries and onion rings) and split a shake.  For $16, I think that's pretty damn good.\n\nI enjoyed my patty melt--it was simple, but nothing life-changing.  I liked the chili on my fries, but the cheese was fake, melty nacho cheese.  I wanted some real, shredded cheddar!\n\nWe got the dark chocolate shake, and it was decent.  Once again, not life-changing.\n\nI still love me some In-n-out, so unless the wait gets shorter and burgers get bigger, I'd rather spend my money there."

My husband loves the Frisco Burger, I always get the single patty cheeseburger.  I love that they are comp[lately made to order so you can get them with whatever toppings you would like.  Their milk shakes are out of this world.  My husband is a real milk shake lover and thinks these are the best around.  I have never had a bad milk shake here. The only downside is that you have to walk through a smoky casino to get to the restaurant."

            "review": "When driving to Las Vegas from California, the first Casino you'll see is The South Point. It's on Las Vegas Blvd, so technically it's \"on The Strip,\" but it's really a couple miles before the actual famous drag begins (I'd say it starts at Mandalay Bay, but I'm not sure that's an official designation). Anyway, a couple years back I was driving into the city and saw The South Point looming, then noticed a big sign for a Steak 'n Shake in the casino... and let out an audible yelp of joy, which my friends proceeded to ridicule (as they should have). But my excitement came from memories of enjoying Steakburgers any Fries on my last trip to the midwest, where SnS locations are commonplace.\n\nWe spent the weekend of the Super Bowl in town, and decided to grab Steak 'n Shake on our way out of Sin City. I ordered my Double Bacon Steakburer, Fries with a side of Cheese dipping sauce, and a Strawberry Shake, posted up at a seat, and watched the fourth quarter as The Packers squeaked by The Steelers and validated Aaron Rodgers' incredible talents. Did the food live up to my expectations and memories? I can't say they quite did... it had been the first time I'd had Steak 'n Shake in six years, and memories of the place were probably overly-romanticized (plus I was pretty drunk when I ate the stuff in Indiana in 05, so that might have contributed). That said, this is a pretty delicious fast food joint with its own style burger, one that doesn't stand up when compared to the fresh deliciousness of In N Out or Shake Shake, but still a very delicious (and very midwestern) juicy disgusting greasy fast food experience. Plus, the fact that the place was at The South Point gave us the opportunity to get on the road ahead of everyone else after the game ended. \n\nI'm just glad that there is a Steak 'n Shake within a four hour drive in my life. I wouldn't be surprised if I end up back at The South Point for another round on my next Las Vegas adventure."

Of being bored at 2 a.m. and hanging out there cause it was the only place in town that was still awake.\n\nUnfortunantly, this location seems to be one of of the few Vegas establishments that ISN'T open 24hrs.

The ridiculous line out the door didn't help it anyway.\n\nI ordered a cheddar cheddarish cheddar burger or something like that.  Really good cheese I will admit.  But thats the only good thing about this burger.  Didn't have any sauce that I can remember, but that is fine.  Lettuce, tomato, and bun were average.  The meat was very unimpressive.  It was thin and flavorless.  It reminded me of the sort of hamburger meat you would get at a school cafeteria.\n\nThe fries were the horrible shoestring junk you would find at in-n-out.  They don't taste like potatoes, but instead taste like whatever grease they were fried in.  I'm pretty fed up with this whole trend of thin crispy fries.  Give me steak fries.  The place is called steak and shake isn't it?\n\nThe milkshake was average at best.  Pretty much the same shake you would expect from mcdonalds.  I'll continue to go to jack in the box if I want a milkshake.\n\nMy buddy ordered the chili.  It was pretty bland and unimpressive from what I heard.\n\nAfter our food was delivered we were completely ignored by the waiter.  Never got any drink refills and never got the mustard we requested."

So that was how we came to check out Steak 'n Shake, located in the South Point Hotel & Casino.  It is located near the escalator to the theater, or just ask a South Point employee for direction and keep an eye out for the long line of people waiting to be seated.\n\nThe wait to be seated was just about 30 minutes for lunch on a Friday, which was very good compared to the 1 hour wait I heard others having to put up with to try the food at SnS.  And our servers were great. Both were very professional, efficient, and friendly.\n\nSince we have 5 in our party, we were able to ordered 5 different hamburgers and 2 hot dogs.\n\nThe Blue Cheese Bacon Burger - Good flavor, not that much blue cheese, a pretty good burger.\n\nThe Grilled Portobello n Swiss Burger - Patty was juicy, decent amount of mushrooms. \n\nGuacamole Steakburger - Not that much guacamole, besides that the burger was good.\n\nSpicy Chipotle Steakburger - Has a slight spicy kick, but nothing a non-wuss can't handled.  \n\nWisconsin Buttery Steakburger - Probably my favorite burger that we ordered.  The onions was good and the beef patty was juicy and flavorful.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the french fries that dominate the bulk of the plate real estate is just not that good.  It is cut smaller than the regular french fries, fairly crispy, but just don't feel like it is as good as other french fries (think McDonald's).\n\nThe hotdogs we tried was just okay at best.  The portions is just like the regular hot dogs you can buy in the grocery store, except you have the pick of different toppings.\n\nChicago-Style Steak Frank - nice combination of toppings. Would order again, if you have the option to not have to get the fries.\n\nColeslaw Steak Frank - Coleslaw was nothing special and there was just about 1 tbsp worth on the hot dog.  Worth the $4.99 price tag??? Definitely not, especially if you can get $0.75 hot dogs from South Point.\n\nMilk Shakes - overall it was very good.  Good portion and taste.\n\nI also don't like having to wait in line again to pay for your meal, especially after having to wait a long time to just get seated.  Overall, the food quality is like food at most fast food restaurants, except the time required to finally get your food disqualifies Steak 'n Shake from the fast food restaurants classification.\n\nFood - 3/5 (1/5 for the fries). \nService - 4/5\nPrice/Value - 2.5/5 (if you can't get full on the burger, which is not all that big, there are plenty of petite cut french fries to fill your tummy)\nLocation - 2.5/5  Unless you live near South Point, it will be a decent amount of drive time.  If you are a tourist without a car, it is definitely not worth the cab fare.\n\nOverall 3/5 at best."

I was promptly disspointed once then twice again.  The first time I went I had the mushroom burger and a chocolate shake.  I must say that the shake was awesome, just like I remember, the burger was absolutely awful.  The amount of grease is still a remembrance, but I was thinking, first week I will come back after Christmas to let them get settled in, again I was very dissapointed, the burger were very greasy, and underseasoned again.  I understand the burgers are generally that way, but its supposed to be in a good way, these were definitely not.  I got the patty melt this time, my fave, and it was just awful, no tasty steakburger patty, or yummy cheese.  But the shake was just as good though, mint chocolate chip, although we got it way after I was done with my burger which was a bummer.  The service here pretty much sucks too, both times I went they forgot my water to go with my shakes, and I asked for it twice the second time I went.  Water is supposed to be pretty much standard when you just have a shake, but whatever.  I tried it twice and I think that we will just go back for the ice cream, if we want to wait in line. Ugh!  Maybe the owners need to go back to the midwest and get some little midwest welcoming spirit and not the buffet crap food that las vegas is known for."

We wound up at the South Point and ALL the buffets were packed like sardine cans and totally overpriced so we wound up at this hole full of drunk, loud tourists. \n\nEvery employee there was pissed because they had to work and the air was thick with contempt you could cut with a knife. Our waiter, Eduardo was literally the laziest, worst waiter I've had in years. The burgers were dry like the Mohave desert, all the food was overcooked and he never once refilled a tea glass. Basically, he dropped the plates on the table and left. When he returned, he dropped the check ON MY PLATE ON TOP OF MY FOOD AND SAUNTERED OFF! \n\nWe were going to order dessert but he never returned. I walked to the register to pay for this sorry excuse for a meal and the cashier who was devoid of any social graces or basic English comprehension was beyond rude. I asked for the season salt, a glass and salad peppers and she froze like a statue and said, \"Are you serious?\"  I said, \"Yes, I'm serious! Move your lazy ass 2 feet to the right or I'll come behind the register and do it myself.\" She stands there dumbstruck not moving so I ask for the manager. Still no movement. She's gone catatonic. So I yell, I need a manager! \n\nThis stooge runs over and asks what's going on. I tell him about the poor service and her bad attitude. No explanation, no apology, no nothing. A vacant stare. Again. Somebody must put Xanax in the water there. No offer for a comped meal. Nothing. I informed him I'm not a tourist, I'm local and I'll never eat here again. Still nothing. \n\nCalled corporate because I have a low tolerance for bad customer service. When I was a waitress I worked my ass off and left people with a good memory to relate so I had regulars. I have serious issues with the lack of competency, social skills and work ethic of people under 40 lately based on recent experiences. \n\nThe Steak 'n Shake restaurants in Houston are so much better. Lately, anything on the strip is lacking in the customer service department."

I was very pleased with the immediate attention.\n\nMenu:\nSince this was our first visit, we gave the menu a good once over so it took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted to try.  The server was very nice and came back a couple times to check on us while we were pondering our choices.\n\nLots of choices... I was surprised.... from burgers to dogs to sandwiches to a few salads to chili and a few other miscellaneous items like chicken strips.\n\nOrdered... and only waited like 10 minutes and our food was out... QWIK BABY! And it was HOT.  :)\n\nI ordered the Guacamole burger, the other 2 in my party got the Buttery Wisconsin and the Chicago Style Steak Frank.\n\nPortions were RIGHT ON!  Not too big so that you waddle out of the place but just big enough to be filling.\n\nNow... the pictures make the burgers and dogs look like they are going to be Gi-Normous when they come out but they aren't.  Don't be afraid to order... you can always cut it in 1/2 and bring it home.\n\nMy Guac burger was very juicy and tender.  (I don't know that I would order the Guac burger again as the Guac had too much onion and green peppers in it and not enough Avocado taste.)  The bun was light and fluffy.\n\nThe fries were thin and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.  And they serve lots of fries with their order... easily can be shared.\n\nDidn't try their shakes as I'm lactose intolerant... but they looked heavenly.  I'm living vicariously through all those folks who I saw slurping away with a smile on their face.\n\nPrice:\nFor 3 people.... at lunch.... $17 w/o tip.... \n\nWe Will Be Back!"

The fries were cold and my burger was so thin I could barely find it between the fat, tasty bun. \nGlad the prices were reasonable or I would have really complained.

And, the wait for seating is out of control.  My advice is, go in the take out line and go sit down in the sports book area and the Del mar deli / bar area, where they have tons of spacious booths.  If you're a filthy smoker, you can even smoke and eat your burger at the same time!\n\nI tried a double cheddar burger and found the portion size right, for a fast food restaurant, where everything is somewhat small.  I was fully satisfied with just two patties and found them way more flavorful than I imagined, and blows away pretty much every other fast food burger in town.  With three patties you're most likely going to have a coronary.  My main reason for loving these burgers though, is that they use real cheddar cheese, not that imitation gunk cheese that is normally used.  It really put this over the top, and with the combination of meat and real cheddar made me wish I had another burger on the drive home.\n\nI'm really happy that this is in a casino and not a normal drive through fast food local restaurant, or I would eat here often.  And gain all the weight I lost in 2010."

The food is every bit as good as I remember it, although the menu seemed to have been scaled down from those in their stand-alone restaurants. They also had no canned chili for sale, a staple in their restaurants back east.\n\nIf this place has a drawback, it is that the people who created the restaurant grossly underestimated the demand, and the place is about half the size it needs to be. Waits of an hour or more for a table are not uncommon, and they are losing business as people leave rather than spend that much time in line. Hopefully this will be only the first of several SnS that open in this area."

The menu isn't big which is a good thing to me because it shows they specialize in certain foods and not a ton of random stuff.\n\nWhen I got my food, I was kind of disappointed- the American patty melt didn't look too appealing at all, it looked sad. Like 2 slabs of \"steak burgers\" with American cheese and Swiss cheese with a smear of thousand island dressing. I got my fries seasoned with salt and vinegar but it mostly tasted like they forgot to put the vinegar in it. My husband got the bacon steak burger and it looked sad as well. It looked like something you order off the menu at McDonald's. He got chili cheese fries instead of regular fries and it had a different taste to it.\n\nAll in all, I liked the thinness of the fries and they were crispy, I liked that I could taste the freshness of the meat and the kindness of the staff but I don't think it was worth the calories nor the wait for a \"steak burger \" because honestly, it didn't taste like a steak burger, to me it was a regular burger that I could get for cheaper elsewhere."

We looked at the Menu for a few minutes not know what to order as everything on the menu looked really good.\n\nI finally made up my mind and decided to order the Cheesy Cheddar Steak Burger with a Peanut Butter Cup shake and an order of Bacon Cheese Fries.  My girlfriend ordered a Patty Melt with an order of Thin 'n Crispy Fries, and her nephew went with the 3 Shooters special and some fries.\n\nOver all the food was really good, and decent service (Took them a while to bring the shake I ordered well after our food was served).  The customer service was pretty friendly.  I would definitley come back and try out some of their other Menu items on a future visit."

The server got busy after we sat down, she was nice but, kept everything short and sweet. We felt kind of rushed to order but, we understood. \n\nWe both ordered the Steak Shooter which is basically like 3 steak sliders. You can order them in different varieties and I ordered one with Ketchup and Onion and the other two were supposed to be the Garlic flavor. On top of that, I ordered a Heath Shake. \n\nWhen the food and shake arrived, it looked like any other fast food place just served on a plate. The fries had no taste and the steak was thin cut and greasy. The shake was served with a spoon and straw but, the consistency wasn't thick so, I didn't need the spoon. In addition, the \"Garlic\" flavored burgers didn't taste like they had any garlic at all. I'm not sure if perhaps she didn't take my order correctly or if that's how they were supposed to taste because they didn't taste like anything but plain burgers. \n\nI honestly would've been happy eating an In-N-Out burger and fries just with this type of setting. I love the theme of the restaurant and wonder if this is how the burgers and fries tasted back in those days because if it was then, I wouldn't be so disappointed. \n\nAll in all, I gave the place three stars for 1) Fast service 2)The decor and 3)my shake actually tasted like what I ordered, Heath. Would I return to this place? Maybe if it was the last place to eat in Southpoint, other than that, I'm fine with In-N-Out."

It's also not only burgers.  They have chili as one of their menu specialties - and it's served Cinncinatti style, over spaghetti.  I need to go back and try this.\n\nDuring my most recent visit, I ordered the chicken melt.  It was a breaded chicken filet topped with cheese, bacon and tomato and the frisco sauce.  This sandwich was only OK - the bread was super buttery (which equals greasy) and the chicken patty wasn't big enough for the bread slices. It came with a side of french fries.  Sadly, these were some of the worst fries I've ever had.  It was just their standard skinny fries, but they didn't seem fresh and they didn't really have any flavor.\n\nThe last time I was there, I ordered the frisco melt.  It was pretty good, but also very greasy.  I also ordered a shake - which seemed overpriced at $4 for a small.  And the shake are WAY too thick.  It's impossible to drink and is more of a dessert.  Otherwise, the burgers are reasonably priced.\n\nThe take out window is great.  There are plenty of menus available so you can decide what you want before getting to the front.  The service is always fast and friendly, and sometimes they have buzzers to let you know when your order is ready. \n\nOverall a nice place with fast, friendly service.  It's something different than the typical fast food.  I hope that sometime they open another location locally not in a casino!"

They were able to seat 17 of us pretty quickly. \n\nMy sister and I decided to split the guacamole burger.  It comes with fries. You can upgrade the fries to seasoned fries for like 75 cents. I added a cup of chili to the meal and I thought it was pretty good. The burger was so good. I definitely would come back again to try to other burgers. All the burgers are super cheap. They also have a good selection of shakes but I didn't try them"

Yes, I get it's a casual dining/ nearly fast food joint. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be tasty for what it is. We had to send two shakes back tonight and we aren't send it backers. The first was \"dark chocolate\" and that tasted like stale chocolate chip crumbles. The next was a milk chocolate and it tasted like milder stale chocolate chips. You know the ones you left In your freezer to make them last longer - they don't really taste anything like chocolate anymore, they taste more like the freezer and the old things in it. So while deciding to send the second back, I just happened to overhear another server holding a shake at a service window and say \"please make another with more chocolate the table says it doesn't taste chocolate enough\" so I decided to ask for the manager- perhaps there was a quality control issue going on that he or she would want to know about. Well he was nice enough, but did not want to hear too much about the bad shake flavor. Just said he'd take it off the bill when I mentioned the bad taste. So I mentioned over hearing about the other chocolate shake from the other table and that's when he lied and said the other table said \"it wasn't thick enough\". I know what I heard the other server say and the manager wasn't there so I don't know why he wanted to change the story. In the end, he said the shakes come from \"shake base\" not ice cream and that it all comes from corporate and they have no control over it. So I guess this issue is more corporate related than location related. Listen up corporate board folks- your chocolate shakes taste really bad and your managers are defensive about it. But the chili is good."

Originally lived by Red Rock Casino but I wanted a younger more hip area so South Pointe is my most local casino... I have never been inside the casino before!   I almost CRAPPED MY PANTS when I seen a Steak and Shake since I thought we only had them back home ... OHIO!!!   I had s Frisco... Ate 1/2 got sick not sure if it was stress of the 1lb of butter and the cold shoe string fries!  Im a server so I'm not saying the servers name...she was sweet but I sat 7 mins before greeted so the moment I was greeted I said my drink and food order .... A good runner brought it out...I asked for a little extra sauce for my fries ...another server brought that out ...ok now that's good team work... But then the server came back to ask if everything is ok but when she's standing behind me. I just had five spinal fusion operations and seriously had to get up and turn around to see if she was for real talking to me.... Either way I'll never go back cause I don't eat fast food and I ONLY ate it to remind me of home... But those seniors love it ...and honestly those shakes are on point!!!

            "review": "Jumping on the current bandwagon and braving the crowds...the Husband loves steak, and I love shakes...so we headed to the grand opening week of Steak 'n Shake at South Point Hotel and Casino in Vegas.  We've been hearing a lot of talk about this place with strangers asking, \"Do you know when they are going to open?\"\n\nOn Friday night, there was a LONG line to get seated, at least over an hour.  However, there was a much shorter, quicker line on the left for to go orders only.  Sweet!  \n\nThe Husband chose the Pepperjack Melt \"Two Steakburgers with melted pepperjack cheese, lettuce, vine-ripened tomato, grilled onions, jalapenos, and mayo on grilled sourdough.\"  First off, it didn't quite look as huge or stacking as advertised, a bit more smashed down.  At one point, the Husband pointed out the lack of jalapenos (and spiciness) in his sandwich.  Meanwhile, we realized that the cut up green stuff in the little plastic cup were his jalapenos, guess you have to add them in yourself.  It also came with fries, thin-style.  Nothing to write home about.  \n\nMeanwhile, I ordered the Chili Max Deluxe.  When I opened my container, it was surprisingly smaller than what I envisioned and I didn't realize it came on spaghetti!  It reminded me of the spaghetti from Jollibee's!  The Husband also paid 99 cents more for extra beef.  I'm looking at my spaghetti and realizing there is no diced onions, shredded cheese, etc. as advertised.  Before I head back to tell them of the error, I look over my receipt and see they they only charged me for the Chili Max.  (Apparently, they did ring me up for the Chili Max Deluxe initially.  But when we added the extra beef , they needed a manager's assistance and ended up deleting that order, and inputting the Chili Max instead.)  I ended up using the little container of jalapenos in my chili to give it a little kick.  I'm afraid to know what the dish would have looked like without the extra beef we paid for.\n\nOf course, you can't hit up Steak 'n Shake without trying their infamous shakes - I went for the Mint Cookies 'n Cream Specialty Shake.  It was yummy good, until I got to the bottom third and noticed no cookies down below.  When it gets mixed, apparently the toppings only stay on the top.  The Husband tried their Strawberry Banana Side By Side Milkshake and it was pretty good.  It was a lot smoother than mine, probably because there was no mixing required.  They also have holiday milkshakes (White Chocolate, Egg Nog, and Peppermint Chocolate Chip) going on right now - which I totally didn't see until after the fact! \n\nI also noticed that they gave me a spoon for my spaghetti chili.  Are you serious?  No fork, no knife, just a spoon.  Last time I checked, I haven't seen anyone try to eat spaghetti with only spoon.  A bit inconvenient when you're getting a to go order and things are missing.\n\nAnd yes, the hostesses dealing with the lines are super nice.  It looked like they had plenty of people on staff as I saw a lot of loitering by the management.  There definitely was a back up on food delivery for those dining in.  (I noticed one server waiting for the rest of her shake orders from the moment I put my order in and until I actually got it, she was still waiting.)\n\nOverall, we've been there and done that.  Steak 'n Shake sadly didn't live up to its expectations.  We both agreed that we loved the shakes though and would come back for that.  But with our dinner costing $20, we left unfulfilled.\n\nThey are currently selling gift cards with a promotion. Buy at least $20 worth, and get a $5 off coupon in your next order (in January/February).  \n\nHappy hour: Weekdays only, 2 pm to 4 pm, and 2 am to 4 am - Half off shakes and drinks"

It's a convenient quick bite if your staying across the street at the Grandview Resorts.\n\nI was excited from prior visits, falling in love with their shakes, but not so much their food. I had convinced my mom to join me again talking up a storm about their shakes. Again had I just stuck to the shakes and had better service maybe I would have given them another 2 stars. \n\nWe got a large order of bacon cheese fries to split $4.79. The picture shows it off in a skillet, there was no fancy skillet. I almost laughed at what the large size portion was, looked like a side order you would get plated next to a burger. Also not to mention but the cheese was Velveeta cheese if I had to put a description to it. Maybe I expected to much wanting real melted cheese. \n\nThe service, was slow to get to our table, seemed as though tables were a grab bag and the waiters/staff eager to work and make tips were the ones that picked up tables. Guess there must have been a power struggle, or over abundance of lazy since people had to debate on whom was going to take our table. \n\nThe shakes, again I should have just stuck with what I know, darn for wanting to stray outside the box. The Chocolate Banana Shake $3.49 was awesome. Though call me a prude but I always want the stainless steel mixer that my liquid bliss is prepared in, or I'm spoiled by other places that give you both. Either way give me both, I'm not asking for much! \n\nShakes yay, food nay!"

Our friend who lives in Vegas suggested this place and this is now my favorite burger joint in Vegas (in&out is still on top of my list). We ordered the single patty burger and double patty burger which was under  $4 each. My hubby ordered burger Royale which is burger with egg. My hubby knows I really liked the food because I finished the burger and fried. There is something about their burger and fries that I love....I think it's coz the patty is thin which is how I like it. Will definitely be back everytime we are in Vegas"

Which I had to add some lettuce and tomato and a little mayo. Then it was MY  perfect S&S  burger. Ha ha ha \n\nThe hubby order the 5 way which was a little spicy for my daughter but good for him.  His burger was the $4.00 triple burger no cheese.  How can you beat that $4.00. Annnnnd it comes with fries. Check the seperate menu. The little girl got the mini burgers kids meal. I did ask Jet our waiter to put mayo, ketchup and lettuce but it came plan with nothing but cheese. Boring!! I had to add mayo it seemed dry.  My niece ordered the chili spaghetti with cheese and onions. Eeeeeeh it's ok.  My nephew ordered the Royale it was alright. So our burger day was good other than the taking forever for the check or actually getting someone to get our check. But it's busy what can you say BUT hire more people. \n\nIf you don't want to wait you can also order for take out.  They have a whole section for take out."

We glanced through the hotel binder and my husband said,\"let's go to Steak and Shake.\" So we wandered down to the restaurant which was hopping at 830pm. It took about 15 minutes for us to get seated but that wasn't horrible. \nOur waiter was a bit slow to come to our table. He did have a couple large parties so that is probably the reason. My hubs got the sliders, my son the steak dog and me the guacamole burger. The place at a Johnny Rockets feel and in the last few years Rockets has been sliding into ick with food. So I wasn't expecting much. \nOur food arrived and then our shakes (which were only average). Our son went to town on his hot dog (he's picky about his dogs) which is a good thing. My hubs gobbled his sliders down. My guacamole burger surprised me by being really good. The guac was nicely flavored, the cheese had a little kick and the burger had flavor! All good!\nLess than $30 for the three if us and we were happily full. Excellent!"

Every once in a while if the mood strikes me and a lean piece of meat crosses my path I'll take a bite, but that's about it.  On this Steak n' Shake evening the exception was made without hesitation.\n\nMy \"real\" order was the guacamole chicken burger and a chocolate shake (hey! you can't eat at steak n' SHAKE without getting a shake!), but I had to order a single steak slider just to say I tried it.\n\nDELICIOUS!

It's cheap, affordable, and the burger is just divine. Of course, it is called \"steak-and-shake\" so if you're ordering a burger, you must accompany it with a shake. Choose. CHOOSE! From the array of selections and if you just can't decide, well you can make your own!\n\nMy sister makes this wonderful shake that I highly recommend. It's an oreo shake mixed in with fresh bananas. The end result tastes just like banana cream pie. I tried their seasonal shake which was the salty caramel pretzel shake. I think the idea of salty and sweet was what bought me into that choice. However, I wasn't too fond as the flavors was just way to strong for my taste. Maybe a little too sweet? Or too salty? Or both? Not sure, but I'd give it that shake a 3. If you're into the salty and sweet, I'd recommend it, but in the end I did wish I got my favorite. The Turtle shake. Delish! A perfect combo of chocolate, caramel, and nuts. \n\nI also recommend their mushroom and swiss burger, chili, and spaghetti. Something about that beef makes you want to \"steak-it-and-shake-it\" haha get it?\n\nAnyway, if you're looking to have a little casual fun with a throwback diner feel, and an affordable place to take a date, lunch, dinner, or what not. This could be your go-to spot. You can go wrong with sharing a good shake. FOR TWO PLEASE! :)"

For dessert, enjoy one of their many milkshakes with countless flavors and toppings. They have your traditional vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Additionally, they have many topping infused flavors such as cookie dough, m&m's, and Reese's cups. This restaurant does get pretty packed at peak times and the wait lines get backed up, especially during events, so plan accordingly!\n\nEverything in their menu is very reasonably priced. For $4.99 I had the triple steak burger which included a French fries, extra for drink. I also had the peppermint chocolate shake for a little over 5 dollars. The burger was really good, the pattys are a bit thin so I recommend getting a triple or a double. The French fries, however, were not to my liking, often too thin and bland.

I will say though, a major plus is that they have both Coke Zero AND you can add a shot of cherry flavoring. That's good.\n\nThe steakburger is seasoned well. Enjoy their seasoning. The rest of the burger is quiet, nothing really happening. The bun wasn't great. The fries were lukewarm at best. Not hot at all. Cajun seasoning was cajun seasoning, nothing special. The Parmesan cheese fries were okay as well, nothing special.\n\nThe patty melt was disappointing. The patty part was fine. The bread they used looked sad. It was thin and soggy. Expected a nice thick toast for a melt. \n\nGot a mint oreo shake to go, which made for a nice treat for later. Was it worth the six bucks you pay for it? I lean towards no. It's a fast food shake. Pretty sure shakes at Carl's Jr are something like a 3 or 4 bucks at most.\n\nBasically Steak 'N' Shake is a fast food restaurant disguised as a sit down diner.

I've heard my friend rave about it, and I've driven by the one in Fredericksburg many times, but had never had the chance to check them out. So when I went out to the casino the next morning around 10:15 to find grub, I decided to patiently wait for their 11AM opening and try it out for myself.\n\nThe atmosphere is 50's burger stand/malt shoppe, with a basic menu offering burgers and fries, sandwiches, chili, and (of course) milkshakes. I opted for the 3D Grilled Cheese - sandwich was great, but the grilled, inside out bun was just a tad too greasy for my tastes. I opted for chili cheese fries as the side, and these were excellent. The chili here is unique - it's more of the gently seasoned Midwest style than the spicy Texas style ... but despite their offerings of Chili Mac 5-Way, this is not really Cincy chili. I think it's a better companion for fries than it would be with pasta or as a stand-alone bowl. \n\nThe prices here are great ... \"gourmet\" burger joints are charging 50-75% more for the same quality, and there was no \"casino bump\" in the prices at the South Point S'nS. I'm excited to take the wife to the one in Fredericksburg the next time we go through, and give some of the other burgers (or the melt) a try."

With the talk thread and excitement surrounding the opening of Steak 'n Shake, we decided to check it out.\n\nIt's still opening week, so there was quite the wait to get a table, probably about half an hour at 9:30pm.  Don't let that discourage you though, because I was walking out the door at 10:45pm; the service was prompt and you get your food quick!  I'm sure the wait time will dwindle once the buzz dies down.\n\nWhile waiting in line Jieun and I had enough time to browse the menu and decide on exactly what we wanted.  I went for the Spicy Chipotle Steakburger while she went for The Original Double 'n Cheese.  Word of warning: the burgers here suffer from the same advertising as Wendy's hamburgers.  No matter what the pictures and websites advertise, your burger patty will be smaller!  On my next visit I won't hesitate to get a burger with three patties.  To be fair though, what these steakburger patties lack in size they make up for in flavor!  The meat is seasoned just right without going into the salty beef territory.  There is a special seasoning salt on each table; none of that was necessary since the burger was already delicious!  \n\nThe milkshakes here are good.  I don't order milkshakes very often, but decided to here because it's part of the restaurant name.  There is a selection of shakes that has two flavors in one glass, but they are side by side and not mixed together.  It's a neat way to serve!\n\nEven with the wait to get in, I came out happy that I tried this place.  One of the best parts of the restaurant is the pricing: for two burgers and two shakes, our bill came to $16 and change.  Not bad at all!  With all the burger meals coming in under $5, you feel like you're getting your money's worth!  I don't think you can even get a full meal for under $5 at a fast food joint, much less one this tasty!  Half jokingly, I made the comment that if I were really hungry, I would order two burger meals and the price would still be on par with Red Robin ;)  With the $2 drink deals that South Point does every so often, I can see Steak 'n Shake becoming a repeat eat!"

While there is almost always a line to wait (it's the only one in the valley, and probably for quite some distance), I'll always say it is worth it.\n\nThe great-quality burgers and lightning speeds for insane prices (seriously, the most expensive dish on the menu is $8) is always fantastic.\n\nMy favorite by far is the Mushroom Swiss Steakburger as it has my 3 favorite burger add-ons: mushrooms, onions, and Swiss cheese.  This fellow right here won't disappoint you nor will it break the bank.\n\nWhile the fry haters out there may disagree, I actually adore the shoestring fries.  The thinness of them allows them to be cooked more evenly, in a quicker fashion, and have the high potential of delivering that satisfying french fry crispiness.\n\nOh, and the milkshakes are amazing as well.  I rarely order them since they are so calorie and sugar dense but they are soooooo good.\n\nInside the South Point Casino, all the way in the back next to the newer Japanese restaurant, Zenshin.  =)"

The butter totally melted through the bottom bun so it got sickening over bit.\n\nThe Straw-nilla shake is super yummy though. I'm not sure if it's something spectacular but somehow that first sip it definitely got me wanting more. I think they use Blue Bunny ice cream - not sure if that makes a difference. \n\nI'll take my friends here if they don't have it in their hometown because it appears on the list of \"20 chains that should be in every state\" but if not, I'm not sure I'll be back for a while."

Combined with the perfect amount of condiments and absolutely amazing shakes they earn an easy 5 stars in the arena of classic American grub. The prices are crazy cheap considering they are located inside of a casino. \n\nI went in with the family one day and couldn't decide on what i wanted to order, so i ordered two meals. HA! Don't tell anyone :) I ate the royal burger like it was my last meal on earth then slowly enjoyed one of those gourmet hotdogs. I decided to go with a half and half shake and combined banana and chocolate. After eating myself into a temporary food coma the bill arrived and i felt guilty. I couldn't believe that I had enjoyed such a serious meal at such a comical price. If you have kids they get hats and cool cars to color as well. \n\nIf your in the area of the south point you absolutely have to try this place. The only bad thing I can say about Steak n' Shake is the fact that sometimes you are forced to stand in line and wait. Standing there smelling all of that awesomeness is not easy."

My favorite since it is near my house.  \n\nUnfortunately, I had a bad experience.  I ordered a regular cheeseburger and fries and it took forever to come out after I waited forever to order it.  When I got it, I was super excited to bite into it only to find that every bite tasted like mustard.  They put way too much mustard in my burger and I was extremely disgusted.  I immediately became really annoyed because my boyfriend was happily enjoying his burger.  \n\nI will have to give 1 star for the price and 1 for my fries as well as my boyfriends burger.  Lucky for me, he gave me 1/4 of his burger so that I can get the mustard taste out of my mouth.  He also enjoyed his shake, but I'm not really a fan of milk shakes.  \n\nI will try it again since I'm at this casino often, but for now, sorry folks, I still prefer In n Out over a mustard burger."

My friend from work built this place up for months, so walking in the door my expectations were through the roof...  There was a long line being that it was opening night...  This wasnt really a problem as people were seemingly very patient and when management came to pass out free cookies, this only increased everyones patience.  I finally made it inside after an hour and 10 minutes of waititng.....  Upon first Glance of the menu, I was overwhelmed with choices... I ended up going with The Triple Steakburger with fries, chocolate shake and a coke zero.... gotta love the coke zero thrown in there... Like I was concerned with the calories that the soda would give me...  \n\nThe food arrived, what a glorious moment.  This burger was pure perfection all the way.  The cheese was melted perfectly inbetween the layers of the 3 burgers and the bun was nice and light....  I finished the entire plate in a matter of moments and right after I finished it left me with feeling like I have to return ASAP.  I gave this place 5 stars because that is as high as Yelp lets us go... I would easily rate this place 6-7 stars.....  Oh yeah, did I mention the price?  36 dollars total with tip for 4 adults and 2 kids is a steal for the quality of the food we experienced.  Have at it Yelpers!!  This place is a must!"

Line seems to always be out the door and the tables crammed with diners.  It's like being in like for Black Friday!  Thank goodness it's in the middle of the South Point casino close to the sports book instead in the freezing desert!  It does get kind of ridiculous.\nWe were in line for a good 45 minutes before being seated.\n\nThe inside is cool, very reminiscent of old 70's diners with the nostalgia feel.  Like the red, white and chrome all around...almost like a classic tricked out lil' GTO!  But enough about the ambiance, let's get to the food!\n\nHonestly, I've had a better burger.  I was kinda expecting to be WOW!  But it was more of a, uh...wow.  Got my balloon a little deflated there.  The shakes are fatty good, and the burgers are A-OK but overall I was just...OK.  This is what I wasted all my time and gas for?  An OK burger.  Not disappointed, but not 'I gotta eat here every week' either.  For what it was it was pretty good.  Decent food for decent prices.  With the line outside always there you would figure this place gave out free kisses from pre-Seal Heidi Klum (yes, for arguments sake she was way hotter back then).\n\nThe menu was good and the prices were very reasonable, especially the 4 meals under $4 each that caught my eye.  This is what I stuck with since it was our first time there.  Your 4 choices were:  a bacon cheeseburger, a double cheeseburger, a triple burger (no cheese), and chicken fingers.  Each meal was served with thin-cut fries.  The fries were awesome (ask for em' cooked well) with lots of ketchup.  My double cheeseburger?  Meh, it was ok.  I mean, seriously...WHERE'S THE BEEF?  My lack of 'steak' made my head 'shake'.  No quarter pounder here?  I loved the charred edges but damn, no juicy beef in the middle?  So of course, my burger ended up a little on the dry side.  There was no re-creation of a Carl's Jr. sloppy burger commercial with Kate Upton in little clothing.  It left me a bit disappointed.\n\nThe shakes are great though (but cost almost as much as a burger).  The cookies and cream one was a fav of mine.  But not for my hips, my glorious hips!  They are definitely on the full flavor side...the shakes, not my hips.\n\nThe service was good but very rushed, you get the feeling like they want you to order, enjoy your meal quickly, then pay and leave for the next folks in the gargantuan line.  I would come here again, but only if I was already on that side of town and it was late night."

We allowed plenty of time before the show, because we heard it was going to take some time to get into the restaurant - that was true, we were 25 minutes in line. This included my husband, who (uncharacteristically of a Las Vegan) will not stand in line for food. \n\nAfter being showed our four-top, we waited another ten minutes before being approached by our waitress who only gave us two service setups with our menus. She disappeared for another 15 minutes, and finally came back to take the rest of our order.\n\n\"Steak\" and \"Shake\" - so we tried to order shakes, but our waitress, whom we had told we were beginning to get tight timewise before the movie, told us that it would take at least 20 minutes to get the shake because they were so busy.  So we ordered iced tea. She took the order and went away.\n\nTen minutes later, my husband noticed that a party which had been far behind us in line was enjoying a tableful of shakes.  He complained to the manager and we got a toffee shake in about three minutes.  It was good, but just as good as the toffee shake you can get at Geri's Cheesesteaks on Pecos where we go often and really like (i have to check and make sure we have reviewed them!)\n\nFifteen minutes after THAT, we started to get antsy.  I noticed the couple which had been right in front of us and seated next to our table had not been served, and I looked around and it was plain that NO food was coming out of the kitchen.  Ten minutes later, we finally saw our waitress and asked how much longer it would be and she promised \"ten more minutes!\" Ten more minutes would have been ten minutes before the start of the movie, even if we missed the trailer and we couldn't wait anymore.  We asked for our check and my husband went up to the counter to pay for our drinks and our one shake with the other man in our group.  \n\nNot only did we have to pay for the drinks and shake, but the manager treated the guys like they were nuts for the fact that we had to leave.\n\nI would have liked to try the food - if it would have been good, I would have said so honestly, but we didn't get that opportunity.\n\nI'm sorry, Steak and Shake won't get another shake from us - I have better things to do with my Sunday afternoon than wait for food I don't get. Therefore: one star, and I've never left one star before."

His attitude was this is a fast food joint, what do you expect? Do not stop here if you actually want fast (as in quickly) food, or good service go somewhere else."

I started screaming in the car, and nearly landed us in the ditch.  \n\nWhy you may ask?  Well, I've been dreaming of their Frisco melts since I moved from Indiana to Arizona FOUR YEARS AGO!  I've begged my sister and dad to freeze one and FedEx it to me, but no!  And why have I been dreaming of them, well there is no Steak n Shake in AZ (BOOOOO!), and I've been eating there in Indiana since I was a teenager.  Good times!!\n\nThis was our first stop when we arrived in Vegas for the Spring Break Yelp Party.   It is located in a Casino/Hotel the South Point.  It opened in December, and if I knew back in January when I went, I would have gone then too.\n\nYes, I got my Frisco Melt, cheese fries, and chili with a dark chocolate shake.\n\nService was fast and friendly during a crazy busy lunch hour.\n\nThe Frisco Melt was what I had been dreaming about.  They did lack on the toppings like lettuce, tomato, and pickles.  I had to ask for them.  Me no likey!!  The fries were not that fresh and I think I got the bottom bash of them instead of the fresh ones.  Me no likey that either.  The chili was wonderful as usual and I always add my ketchup to it.  Try it!  And the dark chocolate shake was mmmm good.\n\nMy husband got the second fav burger of mine, the mushroom swiss.  He said it was really good.  He mentioned my hype on this place was correct.  :)  That's right!  West coast people do not know what they are missing!\n\nOkay, so for next time I'm in Vegas, Steak n Shake is on my list, first thing, so please give your customers fresh french fries and toppings for the burgers.\n\nThank you to the waiter who had to listen to my childhood story for an hour.

Since that summer afternoon I have counted the seconds that I would once again get to savor another fresh, buttery Steakburger and never would I have imagined that it would occur in our own city of Las Vegas, seeing as the closest location is somthing over 1000 miles from here. They have THE best burgers hands down, shakes that no one else can come close to, including side by side shakes that have 2 flavors. Their fries are perfect, so tiny but so delicious. The size of the meat patty isn't the biggest but it is the tastiest. It's the combination of the whole meal, burger, fries, and shake that make it just right. The combination of the perfect food along with the friendliest people in the restaurant biz make it to die for. I'm so thankful this midwest classic has chose Las Vegas as the the only west coast city to serve this amazing food in. Today is the third visit since the 16th, and you can bet I'll be back before long again. You really can't go wrong with Steak n' Shake. Next step: let's get a drive-thru location built in Vegas! \n\nTake-Out is available and the food is very affordable. 4 meals are $4, typical check for two is about $15"

Compare to Ruby's it was just Ok. The banana part of it tasted a little artificial but when combined it was tasty.\nJustin: The Turtle Caramel Nut. GOOD! Cant go wrong with chocolate, caramel, nuts in a vanilla shake.\n\nFries are super thin and are only good when they're fresh. I would say they're a step down from Lucille's shoestring fries.\n\nBurgers\nMe: The frisco shooters with the frisco sauce on the side. Perfect amount for me and uncomfortably full (but I like that uncomfortable full feeling). Frisco sauce is kind of like a cross between a thousand island and a mixture of ketchup/mayo. Yummy for dipping with the fries\nJustin: THe original Double and Cheese. He definitely needed the double patty. Even could of used a third if you really want the meaty flavor.\n\nChili:\n5-way. Ive seen a 5-way on food network and wanted to try it. It was good. exactly what I expected from eating spaghetti with chili cheese bean and onion. BUT add some Frisco Sauce and your set! It takes it up a whole other level. To add ANOTHER level: Take it home, put it on the stove to warm up and it up to crisp it up! yum.\n\nOverall, It was a good meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here unless it was for HALF PRICE HAPPY HOUR from 2-4 am &pm. Half off shakes and drink."

Instead, what I found was the perfect size tasty burger that was absolutely delicious in every way. Their double patties together were the size of one regular sized patty at any other burger joint. But, since they make their patties thinner, they absorb a lot of flavor and were just the perfect amount of crispy on the outside... ooo soo good! \n\nAlso, you can not leave this place without trying one of their shakes!!! I had their Hersey's Special Dark Chocolate shake and I nearly licked the glass clean. Mmm mmm there's nothing more magical than the combination of a creamy chocolate shake with a juicy burger and shoestring fries"

Given that the restaurant is usually pretty full, the waitstaff does a great job. They're friendly and quick. However, if you find yourself needing something after your food has been delivered, you may have to wait longer than you'd like (so make sure you ask for extras right when you get your food!)\n\nThe menu isn't huge. There are steak burgers (not ground beef, but chopped up steak). I find the patties juicy and delicious, albeit a little thin. There are myriad topping configurations, so there will be something for everyone (even if you're one of those weird meat, cheese, bun only people). I'm partial to the Royale (hello, fried egg!) and the Jalepeno Crunch (good spicy, as opposed to want-to-cry spicy). All the burgers come with fries and are quite economical (I want to say you can get a basic burger and fries for like $4. Specialty burgers, with fries, are about $6). There are also hot dogs, salads, chicken strips, etc. The milkshakes are fabulous! They're served in big malt glasses with a straw and a spoon, with whipped cream and a cherry on top! Completely worth it. \n\nFYI: there is a take-out line. Also, when dining in, you pay at the counter in front. Oh, and be sure to throw some of their house seasoning on your fries!"

At least at the end. When we went to divide our orders the cashier was really rude. She questioned our orders like it was our fault they put them together. My friend accidentally got a milkshake put on her order & when we told her it wasn't supposed to be there she said \"so you DONT have milkshakes?\" & gave us attitude. Then when we paid she kept sighing like she was annoyed. When she saw that I grabbed a \"how was your experience\" number she looked down at her name tag & took it off!! Then when my other set of friends paid she instantly turned her frown around. Usually it takes a lot for us to complain but this was a terrible cashier. Couldn't take her name down but we got a picture."

There are many restaurants but no fast food place that serves burgers.\n\nI got the western BBQ burger which was very plain. I think they forgot the BBQ part. It had chopped onions and small pieces of onion rings in it.  It tasted fine considering it was only $5.75 for the burger and fries. Btw, I love their shoestring fries! \n\nOur server was Jason who was very nice and attentive!

            "review": "One of us had a craving for burgers so checked my handy Yelp app to see what was nearby. BAM! Steak N Shake was the one that Mr. B and I agreed on. It's a Midwest childhood favorite of his and I like their mid afternoon Happy Hour menu where drinks and shakes are half off! \n\nAnytime we have visited here the place is pretty busy and not very many vacant tables but we get seated right away. The wait during mid afternoon is never less that five minutes. \n \nGreasy burgers I kid you not!  Especially if you order the Wisconsin Buttery Burger. I justified ordering this since it's my cheat day/weekend and I deprive myself of butter laden everything lately. The burger makers must have knew that too because when I got my plate that burger was dripping in a pool of buttah! No lie! It didn't help either that the grilled onions were dripping in grease as well. Pretty much the bottom part of my bun was soaked in a combination of butter and grease. ICK .. Lucky I don't eat much bread so no loss on me. It is what it is called The BUTTERY burger, but that was bit much.\n \nThe steak burger patties are thin, seasoning wise it's MIA. Good thing for the fry seasoning by the table, I added some and it gave it a little punch to both my burger and skinny fries.  Hmm maybe that's how they're designed to be made plain, make you add your own seasoning in hopes that you'll buy a bottle (because that's exactly what I did!) \n\nPLUS POINTS for Cloth napkins - Name a fast food chain / casual place that has them..I can't think of any. \n\nShakes ...they are thick, really rich. I like getting strawberry/banana. They give you plenty, I never can finish it. Happy Hours it's a bargain so it's no biggie that I waste 1/2 of my shake.\n \nService - This is where I have a beef! (pardon the pun)\nSometimes it's great and on point, other times service is not there. Like our server this past visit. Once we got our burger order and our ticket, that was that.  We wanted to add milkshakes but we didn't see our server nor any other servers in the dining area for about five minutes.  Even the diners in the immediate area were wondering where the heck the servers were.  So MINUS points here.\n\nOur meal for two with burgers, fries, chili  drinks and the milkshakes came just over twenty one bucks.That's pretty cheap.  It's probably why we don't mind coming here. But I'll hold off on the butter next time."

But I decided to throw that rule out the window one day and make a trip to Southpoint to grab some Steak 'n Shake.. hehe woops. \n\nWoops indeed. It wasn't like I remembered it. Yea they were shoestring fries... the kind I absolutely adore, but it just wasn't cutting it. They were so incredibly thin and a little on the hard side that I couldn't even get close to be satisfied at this indulgement. So I ordered a milkshake to go with it (yea I'm the worst dieter in the world...). I went with the mint chocolate cookies & cream. Again unsatisfied. It tasted like it came from the bottom of the machine..you know, that nasty metal taste? Yea... blegh.\n\nOne thing that made me not absolutely hate this place was the sliders with the Frisco sauce. If you're deciding which sauce topping to go with your burgers, nothing beats the Frisco sauce. Burger itself was mediocre.. it's the sauce that makes it more enjoyable. \n\nThis place just isn't worth all the calories.. I'm still glad I fed my craving though. I know now that I won't be craving it for a very long time, and they have an awesome burger/steak seasoning I got to take home. If you collect seasonings like me, that's something you need in your collection!"

The restaurant style is similar to Johnny Rocket's. The first time I was there, we waited outside for about 20mins. I got the portbello and swiss burger. It came with fries. It was pretty good, and I finished it quickly. The fries were ok. I prefer In n Out fries over Steak 'n Shake. \n\nThe second time I went here, it was before noon around 11:30pm. I never got inside. The expected wait time was an hour and I was on a schedule to get back. My group decided to not wait and went to another restaurant.\n\n- 0.5: Wait time.

However, this place just did not live up to it's name. \n\nFood wise - this location was comparable to the other ones I've had. But, presentation wise - I was disappointed. It's not that hard to put together a burger - but yet they've managed to mess it up. Especially when I ordered the BBQ burger. Most of the bacon wasn't even on the burger - and there was BBQ sauce all over my plate. Looked as if someone had murdered the BBQ bottle on my plate. \n\nService is a complete joke. The first time we went - we ordered our shakes before we even ordered the food. And yet - we didn't receive them until about five minutes after we were done eating. \n\nThe second time - we saw our waitress only when she came to take our order. We didn't have a ketchup bottle on our table - and asked the person who brought the food if they could bring us one. They never did, so we took it upon ourselves to take a bottle from an empty table. Turns out - that one was empty. So we tried another - which was empty too. By the end of the meal - none of us had any water yet - so as someone was passing by, we asked her to refill our waters as she already had a pitcher. She re filled one of the glasses before running out of water. She said she'd be right back with another pitcher - but never saw her again. \n\nThis place needs to step up on their service and fire everyone there that doesn't know how to be a server. \n\nI would've given this place one star - if it weren't for the fact that I do love their milkshakes. Just stay away from the Butter Pecan one - but it tastes nothing like butter pecan ice cream."

There were only 8 in our group, but they still had to split us up into 2 groups in order to accomodate our party.\n\nThe ambiance is meant to be retro,  a 50's burger joint. Lots of red and white porcelain tile and vinyl seats, reminds me a lot of the interior of In N Out. The menu has a lot more to offer though. Several in our group enjoyed mixing and matching different milkshake flavors, I stuck to my old standby. \n\nI tried some of their sliders as well as one of their burgers. Their signature steakburger was very good, the meat was nice and moist. The sliders, due to the size of the patties, I think, were a little drier. That's why I liked the A1 slider the best, it seemed to be the moistest.\n\nService was not the friedliest or quickest, slightIy below average. I found myself waiting for refills on my ice tea.

While they didn't give me any onions, there was mayo! Curses! Oh well. I dealt with it. The burger was good otherwise, needed a little ketchup, but easily solved.

They were both good but I think I am outgrowing the sweetness of sugar on sugar on sugar because the shake was pretty meh to me. \nThe best thing about this place is their fries; they have the little crisp, lightly salted shoestring fries that are the things salty dreams are made of.

I had one complaint... the steak burgers are so thin.  Like wafer thin.  I was wondering why most of the burgers were double patties.  Other than that I was happy.  It was also nice because there is a take out section so you can have your food to go too BUT you have to order at the register.  No phone orders.  :("

The waitress came over and looked at me and goes 'the tables move if you want to push it away\"....I was instantly pissed. So you officially called me fat indirectly. F&CK YOU! She was really rude and hard to understand throughout the visit. My grandma tried ordering the small  burgers and the waitress could not understand at all. finally my grandma got fed up and just pointed at one of the $4 meals and said she would do that. \n\nThe food was not up to the standards. The shake tasted like the ice cream had gone bad and they were using expired product. So lumpy and not in a good way. My sister and I both agreed they were horrible! The burger and fries were warm, not hot and fresh. I was so disappointed. Needless to say none of us left a tip for our server who provided horrible service. You expect me to tip you after you essentially call me fat?! NOPE! \n\nMy sister and I went and gave the place a second chance one late night after returning to the hotel. We did takeout this time. Well actually it was the third attempt, as we stood in line a different day but found that the line wasn't moving. We finally the third time got through the line and the food was a bit better, but not by much, the food was ok. I tried the chili fries...waste of money. Just stick with the fries. This place will stay in business because it is a big name and \"fast food\", but really i think everyone will be disappointed. It does not meet the standards of steak and shake and the staff is horrible!"

Something about health regulations. Must be all the old people and kids that eat there or something. Please explain why some places can do this and others cannot.

It was just not good.\n\nI also ordered a milkshake and I have to say one of the worse ever. I don't know what I was expecting because everyone was saying that their milkshakes were bomb. But they truly were the nastiest part of my lunch.\n\nI took it to go to be polite and threw it in the trash when no one was looking. It was like it was made from old ice cream that had melted and was refrozen, three or four times over.

I used to plan my cross country road trip routes based on when I could first make it to a Steak 'n Shake - so, when you opened up in Las Vegas, I was ecstatic! Three visits on opening day ecstatic.\n\nI have always joked that horrible service is part of the charm of SnS, my last two visits, you have taken this hallmark trait and ran with it. The end of May, my wife and I tried to get some food at SnS before I left for a trip back East. We were seated quickly enough that we were confident we could make it to a movie after dinner, if we so chose to do so. That is where the service stopped. Literally. It took 5 minutes (I keep a stopwatch going when I visit to see how bad your service is) for someone to acknowledge we were seated in their section, a server said hello and she would be right back to take our drink order. 6, yes S-I-X minutes later, we had not been acknowledged again. We walked out, not before we left a note on the table letting whoever saw it (probably a busser that ignored it) that making customers in a non-busy restaurant wait for 11+ minutes for no drink or food order is unacceptable.\n\nNow we come to our visit yesterday for lunch. There was a bit of a line to be seated, was not that bad though. It only took 10-15 minutes to go through the corral and be seated. As you may infer, we know what we want to order when we get to SnS, this was again the case yesterday. \n\nWithin 3 minutes (Woohoo) our server took our drink and food orders. He informed us that SnS is now charging for sides of ranch and Frisco Sauce (are you kidding me?!) Whatever, I need the sauce to dip my Frisco Melt in, so I ordered it anyway. After a few hiccups trying to get our order taken properly, he re-read it back to us correct.\n\nOur drinks came out and he forgot my wife's water (we both order water and something with flavor). Good thing, too, as that was the last we saw of our server. A food runner brought out our food and disappeared with quickness.\n\nMy wife opened up her burger after taking a bite and saw they put the salsa on it she specifically asked be left off (that our server confirmed would be left off) - he did not key it into the computer though.\n\nWe waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nI finished my food.\n\nAnd we waited some more.\n\nOur drinks were now all completely empty. We were wishing the A/C was on a little warmer, so the ice would melt, giving us something else to drink. \n\nAs soon as our drinks were delivered, we did not see our server again. Not only did he avoid our table the rest of our visit but we did not see him in the dining room again until we were at the register.\n\nMy wife was fuming, as extremely hungry people tend to get, when food is before them that is not as ordered and NOBODY CHECKS ON YOU. This is the final straw and we will not be back.\n\nOn speaking with the cashier, she had to go in back to get authorization to remove the improperly prepared burger from the tab. We had other concerns and were not given a chance to speak with a manager. So, here it is for everybody to read and see how you treat your (formerly) loyal customers."

We got the food and drinks very quickly, which is always nice. After taking a few sips of our drinks we realized that the cups were filthy! My husband wiped his napkin on the inside and got a brown residue on it. We then got to looking at the silverware, and it was dirty as well! We called the server over and she apologized and then goes on to tell us that this isn't the first time that has happened, that made me feel SO MUCH better! The manager did take the drinks off our bill and they gave us new drinks in to-go cups, but one of the cups had a hole in the bottom! At this point we didn't even want to try the milkshakes that they are so famous for. With all that being said, the burgers were still pretty good and I liked the fry seasoning, not worth going back though."

I have been there quite a few times and almost each time, the burger was delicious. The only burger that I did not find to be really appetizing was the bacon lover burger. It was just lacking in flavor and the bacon wasn't that good. nothing like the picture. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. Not wanting to be one of \"those\" customers to complain or send food back, I just opened the pepper sauce up, poured some on my burger, and ate a few peppers with my burger. Instant fix. Other than that, I have never received any cold or anything that the other people have complained about. I also love their onion rings! Sooo delicious!!!!! They make me smile just thinking about them! The reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of five is because of the sup-par burger and also, sometimes their service is kind of slow. Nobody has ever been rude to me either... slow, yes. Rude, no. Just go try the place out. FIRE."

Imagine my surprise as I pull into Las Vegas and see a sign that there is one right in South Point! Couldn't wait to check in and head over there. It seemed to be very popular as I had to wait in line for 10 minutes, and the line was just as long when I finished my meal. And the remainder of the week too. \n\nThe mushroom burger was awesome, and I loved the Side by Side milkshake! Banana on one side of the glass and Strawberry on the other!  One thing that I liked is that was a little different than your regular burger joint is that you can choose a salad as your side instead of the standard fries and the burger is not made with ground beef but a thin steak with no meat fillers. So all the burgers had double patties but were not too much to eat. Seeing the double patty scared a few folks. I could hear them asking \"can I have just one patty?\" It must happen a lot because the waitresses had the answer to satisfy them.\n\nCan't wait until they hit the Bay Area!"

But it is amazing, instead of using croutons they use deep fried tortilla strips and everything is just yummy! \n\nYou must go here and try anything on their menu, you will not be disappointed! I promise."

And I was ultimately disappointed when our food came . The only way to make the burger or fries to taste even a little good was to cover them it ketchup or their special seasoning. But I did finish my burger because I was hungry . And the thing I was most excited for , the m&m \"milk shake\" was even more disappointing .. It tasted like a mixture of dry wall, dirty water, skim milk , and crushed m&m's with whip cream on top . I guess you can go here if your craving a burger but don't be too disappointed when your food arrives. It is very cheap though."

Once inside, it takes them a while to bring you the water and after you order, it takes about 20-25 mins to get your food so you can start eating. The speed of the restaurant is really really slow. Like idk what they do back there but they're really slow lol. \nOn the other hand, the food was very delicious. I loved it. The shake is great, the burger is greesy but it's like greesy good. Greasy? But yeah, it's really really good. They have this really spicy jelopeno vinegar sauce that is to die for! I definitely recommend this to everyone who loves burgers to come here and try it. \nThe only problem that I may see people having problem with is the slowness. \nBut hopefully you enjoy it and hopefully this helps! :)"

The sad part of this story is that I live in Los Angeles and it is heart-breaking that there isn't any Steak 'n Shake around here. So when I stayed at South Point in Vegas, I knew I had to get Steak 'n Shake!\n\nI tried to call to order my food for pick-up but they said that I had to physically come in and order the food. Every time I passed by the restaurant, there is a line of people waiting to dine at Steak 'n Shake. So I knew I wanted my food to-go. There was a line for take-out and probably 7 people in front of me. By the time I ordered and got my food, 45 minutes have passed. I guess there is just going to be a wait regardless if you're dining in or taking it to-go. \n\nI ordered the Frisco Melt (I love it!), which came with fries. I also got a cup of chili and a large unsweetened tea (the tea was only $1!). The Frisco Melt was delicious and just as I remembered it! I got a side of Thousand Island (which was 25 cents) to dunk the sandwich in and that only made it all the more enjoyable! The fries were okay. I personally thought they were too skinny and did not have much flavor. The cup of chili was rather disappointing. When I opened it, it had a thin visible layer of oil at the top. It was somewhat bland and there were no toppings like diced onions, tomatoes, cilantro or sour cream.  \n\nNonetheless, I would definitely go back for the Frisco Melt. I might just stay at South Point again, with one of the major reasons being Steak 'n Shake! I wish it was closer to me but until then, I will visit this location despite the wait!"

Good flavor, bun was good, they have soo many toppings to choose from. The fries don't cone salted so u have to season it yourself. Now the milkshakes are the best I've had, super thick & yummy.

Too bad that isn't the case here in Vegas, a 24 hour town & inside a Casino to boot! \n\nThe food here was pretty much the same quality that I have had from the others, with the exception of it being a lot cleaner here, being brand new & all. Also, the fact that the grills here don't have years of seasoning on them yet, so the taste is slightly different. This place is extremely bright & reminds me of a Clean Room or a Hospital. A feeling you definitely wouldn't get from any of the ones I have frequented :P \n\nMy date du jour & I came here pretty late one night during the week, about an hour or so before closing, so fortunately there wasn't much of a line. We both weren't too hungry, so we just went with some Seakburger Shooters & a couple of milkshakes. \n\nWe had Buffalo, Frisco, Ketchup & Mustard & Ketchup & Onion shooters. I had a Chocolate Covered Strawberry shake, which was a special at the time & my date had a Peanut Butter Cup shake. The shakes were pretty awesome! Unfortunately, they kind of messed up the Shooter order & had to bring out some extras to make up for it, needless to say, they never got it right :P But whatever, we got some FREE Shooters out of the deal & I do love FREE!! \n\nOverall, I will come back whenever I am in the mood for a decent shake or a Frisco Melt, which is usually what I get anyways. I would recommend this place for someone who hasn't tried it before & form their own opinions about it."

Steakburger shooters was my weapon of choice this time. I love to customize and they were very receptive to it.  I went with Cajun, Chipotle and BBQ but added grilled onions and Bacon along with Cajun fries. The meal starts at around $6 so a little customizing won't break the bank!  I had water with the meal because I had to finish this madness with a shake. Mocha with fresh banana was my guilty pleasure.  If you haven't tried them live a little your in Vegas,  why not?"

            "review": "I was eager to sample the offerings of South Point's newest culinary addition, Steak 'n Shake, but until very recently was deterred by reports of huge lines just to get inside the restaurant.  On this night we were lucky, and only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were admitted to the inner sanctum.  The place was bright and lively, and packed with happy people.  Servers were scrambling quickly about delivering steakburgers and tantalizing-looking milk shakes to the eager awaiting diners seated at white-topped tables and booths.  Huge photographs of food preparers clad in white 50s-style uniforms with cocked military-style caps adorned the back wall, looking not much different from their present-day counterparts.\n\nDiane and I were both quite hungry after a long drive from California; we hadn't eaten for several hours; and of course I had to order mightily to round out a good review of various kinds of fast food fare.  So, we showed little restraint.\n\nI noted that canned chili was sold on premises.  And, I logically reasoned that any restaurant that cans and sells its chili out the door must make a memorable species of the hot stuff.  And, I am a sucker for good homemade chili--with beans or not.  So, I opened with a side of Genuine Chili with onions but no cheese.  As luck would have it, this chili came with beans, which is the way I prefer.  It was quite good, with a lot of liquid goodness, and a noticeable but not extreme backbite to tickle the throat on the way down.  As a testament to the quality of this chili, I ate all that was set before me, and took a can home that I enjoyed as part of my lunch the very next day.\n\nNext up was a Chicago-style Frank & Fries.  The dog contained a slightly split all-beef wiener, classic emerald green relish, chopped white onions, two sport peppers, and a slice of ripe tomato on a slightly toasted bun.  After downing one complete sport pepper, it seemed like my stomach had turned into a hearth with a log fully ablaze inside it.  So, I elected to bypass the second pepper.  The hot dog was very, very good.  But I would have preferred an untoasted soft bun, and some juiciness had probably escaped where the meat had been sliced.  But the dog was still juicy.  Fries were shoestring style, slightly crispy, and tasty enough.  And, although I couldn't get my Original Double Steakburger with Cheese & Fries (I told you I lacked restraint in ordering on this night!) made even close to medium-rare, it was still fairly juicy and tasty with two hamburger patties, crunchy circling strands of white onion, a tomato slice, a couple of pickles, a slice of orange cheese, fresh lettuce, and tomato ketchup added.\n\nBut the real highlights of this particular meal hands down were the two majestic milk shakes.  We each had a hand-dipped \"specialty shake\"--which means the most expensive variety served.  Diane selected Double Chocolate Fudge, which was really chocolatey and naturally enhanced by hot fudge; and I chose Butter Pecan.  As luscious as that shake was, it had a surprise in store for me that made it probably the best milk shake I have ever had the pleasure of savoring.  For, it was dotted with small bits of pecan.  But these tiny pecan pieces were unlike any I had tasted before.  They were more like pecan seeds that when bit into simply burst with the flavor of pecan.  When at last I got through the cherries, whipped cream, and tall milk shake itself, about 100 of these morsels lay at the bottom of my milk shake glass.  And, I just scooped them up repeatedly with the long spoon provided, and crunched them on the roof of my mouth in spoonfuls, letting the bursts of intense pecan flavor lazily wash down my throat, until at last all were gone.  A heavenly end to a fine fast food meal!"

Luckily, I got there around 11pm on a Monday night and it was pretty empty, so I did not have to wait to be seated and the service was very fast.  I ordered the Original Double Cheeseburger and fries, which surprisingly, is still only $3.99.  This is truly a bargain, especially considering it is full-service restaurant.  The burger was decent, with their signature crispy edges.  The fries, however, seemed almost stale, even though they were served hot.  Overall, it is good option for super cheap eats when at South Point, but I would not go out of my way to go there."

Back in Chicago, it was a routine stop for lunch. We've tried this location a couple times before, but were always turned off by the long wait. This visit, we beat the rush and were seated right away.\n\nI chose a jalapeno melt, but was left wishing I went with my husband's choice, the portobello and swiss burger. My melt was odd, not terribly cheesy, the jalapenos came diced on the side. The bread overpowered the rest of melt. His burger, though,  was juicy and cheesy, just as it should be. I enjoyed their thin and crispy fries and the husband enjoyed his shake very much. The tab was less than twenty bucks, not bad, for a sit down meal. \n\nWe returned the next night grabbed a bite before catching a movie. This time we went to the takeout window. It is definitely the way to go if you don't have time to wait. This time we went with the original burgers, no shake, only fries. I think dinner was about $12. Cheap and easy."

Those thin, crispy fries were as advertised and the burger was freshly prepared and hot off the grill. It was also hand-formed and every bite had great cheese coverage. Yes, it's fast food, but even in this category, some places shine and Steak N' Shake (although not worth waiting hours for) is easily fits in my personal top 5 of fast food burger joints (White castle, In n'out, Culvers, Big mac)."

I got chilli cheese fries, won't make that mistake again. They were pretty crappy. But the mushroom burger was tasty. We had went after a movie, where we had some popcorn and that junk so there wasn't room for a shake. This last time we took the kids and they really enjoyed it also. They got little paper cars to put together with stickers that were cute. On to the food: I got the mushroom burger again cause it was just so good the first time, as did my husband. It did not disappoint. Don't get me wrong their not gourmet burgers by far, but their good. Servings aren't huge, but the prices aren't either. Nice selection of shakes we got the cookies and cream and butterfinger. I'd take the fam back for sure. It wasnt that much more then say Mc Donalds but a far better experience"

            "review": "Ever since my first trip to Tampa a few years ago, I've been going crazy to try Steak n Shake. It's one of those spots that seems to everywhere, but in California. It's that \"want it because you can't get it\" kind of desire so, when we saw a sign at South Point during this week's trip to Vegas saying one had opened, we immediately added it to the top of our itinerary. (fact: this is the first Steak n Shake on the west coast!)\n\nIt's only been open a week, but the hostess, Tammie, said the line had wrapped from the entrance of the restaurant to the Christmas tree by the Poker Room. Fortunately for us, the line had calmed down to 1/4 of that size, so we only waited about 15 minutes for seats (not bad considering the interior space is rather limited- it's a bit small in there!) Tammie was great though, she really made sure the line moved and was constantly updating her queue. We were on the list without half our party even being aware of it (she asked one our friends almost immediately upon falling in line, but did it so quickly that no one noticed!) \n\nThe food isn't amazing, but it's plentiful and affordable. Most sandwiches list at under $6 and all come with fries. \n\nSome key deals to keep in mind:\n\n- Go to Happy Hour from 2-4 (am or pm) for half off shakes (by the way, a regular sized shake is enough for two to share but, if you can't finish it or don't have a partner in shake, they'll give you a to-go cup... same goes for the soda!)\n- Check the 4 for $4 menu for burgers and fries all for $4\n\nThere are still a few kinks to work out, like the delay to get refills on water or to get the bill, but that's all to be expected considering how young the place is. \n\nWe all sampled:\n\n- the Bacon and Blue burger\nIt came with a huge clump of blue cheese, which made me extremely happy. \n\n- the Western BBQ burger\nGood BBQ sauce and excellent crunch from the fried onions. \n\n- the Portobello Burger\nReally tasty, with excellently cooked mushrooms, but a bit salty. \n\n- the Banana-Chocolate side-by-side shake\nDelicious combination of flavors, with a banana side that tasted great and not too artificial (as is the case with lots of banana syrups). \n\n- the Butter Pecan shake\nJust like someone melted butter pecan ice cream and served it straight up, but upped with the addition of candied pecans\n\n- the Oreo Cookie shake\nReally great, as per usual- you can't mess this up. But what's great is they leave some cookies more whole so that milk soaked pieces end up at the bottom of the cup. \n\n- the Orange Cream shake \nLike a creamsicle- what's more to say?\n\n- the Chili Cheese fries\nGood, not great. I really detest cheese fries that use sauce instead of the real deal, but it was edible."

It came with shoe string fries that were good too. We ordered two cups of their chili which I am now craving. My brother ordered the bar b que burger which he liked. The good thing is that the burgers are like regular sized so you can eat everything on your plate without busting your gut. \n\nMy brother ordered two shakes and I also got a Jr strawberry shake. The strawberry shake is the best I have had. \n\nAll this food for $40, my mom had a coupon which took $15 off. I can't wait to go back to Vegas to eat here again!"

            "review": "I really don't know if my review for Steak 'n Shake is going to have much relevance, due to the fact that I had neither steak or shakes.  So yeah, this is pretty weird. It's like the time I went to the Cheesecake Factory and ordered some Chinese food and complain it didn't taste very good. Maybe I should've figured out that their specialty has less to do with Chinese food and more to do with their actual restaurant name (It can't be factories, so it must be cheesecakes, right?). I can't tell you about their cheesecakes because I didn't have any. Whoa, anyways, sorry for going off on a slight tangent.  I can assure you I wasn't as brainless this time, and I originally planned to eat some steak until I saw their hot dog menu. I ordered their Chicago dog, and because I had some wine a couple hours ago I thought a shake wasn't necessary. I was conscious of my decision and yearned for something out of the ordinary. \n\nI ate their Chicago dog with a side serving of fries. Gotta say it was pretty damn good. The color of the relish was unbelievable. I actually didn't even know it was relish until I tasted it. It was so diced to the point it looked like a completely different vegetable. The fries were killer as well. They were thin and crunchy, kinda like the ones from McDonalds, but not drenched in oil nor salt.\n\nThe place was jampacked and the waiting time was pretty long. In the end, however, it was all worth it. I definitely want to go again in the future. Maybe next time I'll be normal and actually order their specialty."

The restaurant isn't quite as big as it should be for how popular they are so you will likely have to wait a little bit during peak hours.\nThere were 3 of us in our party; we each got a variation of their standard cheeseburger, our variances being only in the amount of patties we each desired. I myself chose the double and substituted chili cheese fries for the regular style. The chili was decent, a little thinner than I expected chili over fries to be but not a bad taste. The burger was good, not amazing but definitely worth $3 and some change. The fries were probably the best part of the meal; we all agreed. \nIt is a drive from a lot of areas in LV, especially if you're in North LV but again it's definitely worth the price."

I seriously kid you not but it seriously took him over 40 mins. Poor guy. Maybe we should of dined in instead to save him of all this trouble. \n\nHe said that the place is pretty unorganized and poorly under staffed. There was only 1 person taking orders for the take out window. And the server wasn't there all the time.  The sever will check on the previous orders or will be helping around the restaurant! The place just looked pretty chaotic and ppl around are getting impatient but yet they all don't have a choice. There wasn't a food court in South Point! So there was only 2-3 places that allow take outs. \n\nWe ordered the original double stacked cheeseburger for $3.99 and a harvest Apple grill chicken salad $11.99. The food was worth the wait. But still not worth a 40 min wait.  The burger was out of this world!! It had a lot of flavor and very juicy but yet not too oily.  I would come back again just to dine in next time. The salad was just as good to but on a healthier note. The grill chicken was Nicky seasoned and grilled so that it was not dry. They served a reasonable size chicken over the salad. The rest of the salad was garnished with slicers apples, dry cranberries, and pine nuts. It felt like I was haven't a trail mix in a salad. I really enjoy the nice blend and I know I wouldn't be able to order this salad anywhere else. But a great idea on what to put in your salad at home. \n\nNext time I would dine in instead of ordering to go. Might as well enjoy a quiet bonding time since the kitchen and staff are slow. I'll even order a shake next time to keep me company.."

When I heard they were opening one at the South Point I got pretty psyched for it.\n\nI really, really wanted to love this place since it makes me feel a bit nostalgic, but it can be very inconsistant. Some days are great, others...not so much.\n\nThe prices are fair and reasonable. The burgers are okay, but can't compete with In N Out or even Five Guys. You could do much worse though.\n\nThe service is very hit or miss. I've had days where it was outstanding. I've also had a couple of visits where I wondered if I would even come back. It gets a little busy and it seems like some of the staff just throw that whole customer service idea right out the window.\n\nIf you happen to be at South Point and you've already hit the Del Mar Deli and want to try something else  than it will do, I guess. It's just nothing to go out of your way for.\n\nLast year when I was in Florida, I hit a Steak N Shake there and it was GREAT! Too bad it doesn't seem to translate out here. Shame."

Two different groups came in  after us and got their drinks, food, etc., before we even got drink.  Our waitress disappeared, then the waiter was no where to be found, then the manager or lead someone was mentally kind of not there....\n\nAs the food ended, just like to get the food, I had to stand up and actually go find someone as we had been sitting for a while just to get the bill.

I told them I just wanted a plain hamburger with no bun because of gluten allergies and no mention was made of the fries containing gluten, but they did say they would make sure they prepared my burger separately. About 15 minutes after the rest of my party's food had arrived, the waiter told me that my burger was sitting in the kitchen and done (though he was not delivering it to the table yet) but that I wouldn't be receiving fries because they were not gluten free. He asked if I wanted a side salad, and I said no (because who comes to Steak & Shake for salad?!) and I asked if I could just be charged for the hamburger patty I was receiving instead of the full meal. He refused and said I would be charged full price regardless.\n\nMy friend, with nut allergies, said she had a similar experience when she tried to get a milkshake from this location, with the waitress telling her that it would be a 20 minute wait to make a milkshake because they had to make it on a separate machine. I think this will be my last experience at Steak & Shake."

The shooters were small, but well cooked and three of them were enough to make me feel like I had a good lunch without that over-stuffed feeling. The fries were well cooked but super skinny.

I've taken friends there and have been happy to share the place with those who have never heard of it. But this franchisee is violating their contract as of late.\n\nI went there with my friend Friday for lunch and I can tell you it was nothing but horrible. First they brought us our shakes in styrofoam to-go cups, uh...we're dining-in here. When we complained they mostly said tough, we've run out of glassware. After that, people around us were getting their shakes in glassware. On top of this the milkshakes were horrendous. They tasted like frozen fast food product and had a very icy texture like a Wendy's Frosty. They were definitely not the hand dipped ice cream milk shakes I have enjoyed all of my life at Steak N Shake.\n\nThen when the burgers came I took one bite and could tell it didn't taste proper plus I couldn't see any cheese. I told the waitress and she stuck her fingers in between the patties and showed me the cheese, like 3 or 4 little melted specks. I said it doesn't taste right and sent it back. She said that she would have to make another one since she stuck her fingers in it, how gracious of her, but to which I responded my appetite is lost, just take it off the bill. I tried to complain to the manager, an Indian lady named Naryet or something like that and she basically blew me off. \n\nMy friend was hungry and went on to eat his and later paid dearly for it. He called me that evening complaining of severe stomach pains and vomiting.\n\nThis franchise is cutting corners and I am sure are in violation of their contract. They have no understanding of the ambiance and mystique of the classic American burger diner that Steak N Shake exemplifies. This is what happens when irresponsible franchisees run businesses like this and the franchiser doesn't pay attention and just counts the money. I really hated to see this since living in Vegas is a far different experience from the south where I grew up. It was nice to go to that restaurant and feel like a little bit of nostalgia existed but it's gone."

The service is good and their milkshakes are tasty. The burgers are alright, but not my favorite. They aren't big, juicy, sloppy, totally messy burgers and that is what I love. They get the job done though. I enjoy the mushroom one when I am there. I tried their chili cheese hot dog and wasn't impressed. Stick to the burger and milkshakes.\nI'd much rather make the trip over to 5 guys though and pay a few extra dollars to get my iron fill.\nThey also have a togo window off to the side if you call ahead or you can even order there. I'll take some of their milkshakes to go. mmm"

The table we were seated at was filthy, as was the ketchup container that was on our table (layers of visible greasy fingerprints, as well as layers of hardened ketchup all around the outside of the cap. Disgusting.) We had to request our table be wiped down, and that we get a different ketchup container. If the seating area is so visibly unclean to customers, what must the kitchen area that we can't see be like?\nAnd then there's this: they have very obviously downgraded the product they use for their burgers. The taste has changed and not for the better. The meat now has an underlying taste and smell to the point of being rancid. I noticed it the time we ate there before this one, but thought it was just an isolated incident and/or maybe it was just my picky ass. Nope. My husband noticed it with his burger this time, too. I want to throw up just thinking about it. I have since contemplated just going there for a 1/2 price shake during happy hour but have come to the conclusion of no. Because filth."

The line was semi long when we got there but we were seated in a matter of 15 minutes. We all had shakes, my favorite is the Strawnilla side by side shake (half strawberry, half vanilla). The best thing on the menu in my opinion is the Frisco melt and there chilli is great. The food was good and the price beats Johnny Rockets anyway. We will be back!

WTF?  When the chicken patty finally arrived, my husband could only eat a few bites, he said it was rubbery and gross.  My burger finally arrived and was stone cold, I believe it had been sitting around while the chicken sandwich traveled to and from the buffet.  Also, the fries were soggy.

I got a grilled chicken sandwich it was so bland the chicken had no flavor and wasnt even juicy. The fries were stale. They were literally chewy fries. Shoe string fries?? More like rubbery stale fries. My 7 yr old wouldnt even eat them. My daughter hot dog had some burnt spots on it. Which if any restaurant understands a kids meal with burnt stuff on it is never good. My daughters friend ordered the kids mac n cheese. Well there was probably I'll say 3 big spoonfuls of mac n cheese in the bowl. My friend got the turkey club and she ate half of it and said she will never again return to steak n shake. We went up to the cash register to pay and the girl asked how the meal was and my friend said it was horrible and we wont be coming back. She asked if we told our waitress and we said no. Only reason why we didnt say anything is because we arent the people that go into a restaurant and complain, but the lady that asked we made sure we were honest our meals weren't good. Also we had a movie we were attending around that time and we didn't have much time to complain about our meals and have to deal with that so we just left it alone but made it clear that our meals weren't good at all. Nothing about that place impressed me. But thats just me. Just stinks because we were expecting it to be a nice dinner. I wouldnt recommend this place unless you want to waste your money on low quality food. For that price I could have went to McDonald's and at least gotten fresh, crispy golden hot fries and a cheese burger."

I am a hopeless glutton, and the fastest way to my heart is through my stomach. The more I read your menu and explored your website the more I was drawn to you.  I dreamed about you. I imagined what our first meeting would be like. I knew what I would order and knew exactly how it would taste. I wanted to meet you in person but the closest SnS was in Texas...just like Romeo and Juliet, the universe was keeping us apart. Yeah, sure, I explored other options...In n' Out, Five Guys...but while I was with them, I was thinking about you.\n\nYou can only imagine my excitement when I heard that you were coming to Las Vegas, my home away from home. My heart soared. I didn't want to appear too desperate so I gave you a week to get settled in to your new home. When I arrived I knew exactly how it would be...how you would look...what I would order. You made me wait 30 minutes, but what was 30 minutes more of  a wait to meet my soulmate. And it was indeed worth the wait. It was a love connection! We spent two amazing nights together...nights I will remember forever. And although I had to leave you, I will return to you...soon, and often.\n\nOK, now that I have totally creeped you out here is what we ordered. We actually went twice in 2 days...yeah, it WAS that good:\n\nWisconsin Buttery Burger-two delicious crusty perfectly cooked steakburger patties, one slice of gooey melty cheese, all covered in butter. Yeah, this was pretty much heaven.\n\nGuacamole Steakburger-the same two delicious patties, jalapeno jack cheese, and yummy guacamole. So good!\n\nTriple Steakburger with cheese-more of the same goodness...3 patties and two slices cheese.\n\nThe burgers come with amazing shoestring fries. They are thin and crispy and the seasoning salt is awesome!\n\nA side of chili- A bowl of luscious chili flavored reddish-brown liquid filled with perfectly cooked kidney beans and ground steakburger meat. More like chili beans than standard chili, but you can pay a $1 for extra beef. It was really delicious.\n\nHershey's Special Dark Shake- Creamy, fluffy, frozen, chocolate heaven. The shake was gigantic and delicious topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips.\n\nPeppermint Chocolate Chip Shake-This was one of the special holiday shakes they had on the menu (Along with white chocolate and egg nog.) It was a minty, chocolately Christmas celebration in my mouth! \n\nWe had great food and great service both times we went. It is in the casino in the South Point Hotel, and there was a 30 minute wait each time. I am just so sad there isn't a SnS near Los Angeles."

Most burgers were under $7 and they came with fries!\n\nJust a quick note: They are really busy so, expect a line. Or go there semi-hungry because there is a wait.\nYou know what they say, \"Good things come to those that wait...\""

I used to eat there in Atlanta and in Louisville.  I love their little burgers and those awesome shoestring fries!\n\nIn reading some of the reviews here, I was wary, but I had to go . . . when would I get my next chance???  Yes, the line can be long (but, in my mind, that's usually a GOOD sign - they can only do what they can do with the space they have and the speed of the diners).  I avoided this by going just before noon.  \n\nMy server was excellent - she immediately came over and got my drink order and then returned with my coke and took my food order.  Food came hot off the grill/fryer and in a very short time.  The server was attentive, friendly, smiling and just perfect (the rest of the folks at South Point Hotel and Casino could learn from her).  The food was just as I remember it from years past - and, I had a wonderful time reminiscing about those past experiences and the friends I shared them with . . .\n\nI'd go back!  Really good experience!"

We had to wait to to be seated.\n\nI had a slider trio with different sauces (A-1, BBQ, Ketchup and onions) that was served with fries and my boyfriend had a burger. It was very good and I can see why it's so popular. However, this is not a good place to kick off a weekend after months of fairly \"clean eating\". It's a fatty food grease fest! \n\nThe sliders were good, but I think Crystal or White Castle are much better. \n\nOur server was friendly and quick.

You would think that being a restaurant inside of a casino that the food will be expensive. Not at all. You can grab a full meal with a shake for about $7-$8.\n\nNow the downside... The line outside of Steak N Shake is ridiculous. On a dinner night you'll be waiting in line for about 30-40 minutes. About an hour on weekends. Then once seated it takes about 20 minutes for your order to come to the table and they always bring your shake out later than your food. It's very noisy and all the tables and booths to sit at are bunch together so its hard to enjoy your meal with people in your face and overhearing other peoples conversations.\n\nOverall, the place is great because of the food, the nice staff, the variety of items to choose from on the menu, and the takeout window they titled \"takhomasak\" lol. It just sucks that the only location is on the other side of town. Especially if you live in the Centennial/Aliante area."

Prices are decent especially $4 menu.  Usually end up here every time after bowling or seeing a film at the cinemas.  I love how there is flavored seasoning and hot pepper sauce at table to add a kick and that you can get different seasonings for fries instead of having them plain.  Only downside is they usually have long lines at peak times like dinner, but there is a take out window to order to go."

The hostess was nice and friendly, but the food was a big disappointment and confirms why the restaurant was dead for a Monday lunch hour. My husband and I both ordered a salad that came out with several brown pieces mixed with some oversize cuts of iceberg lettuce. The Blue cheese did not taste like blue cheese and was very runny. I could only pick at my crispy croutons & carrots the most decent part of the \"salad\". I was looking forward to the burger after the salad, but bleh... The pickles on the burger were soft, not how pickles on a burger should be (crispy & crunchy) They gave me a thin piece of lettuce on it, just bland and basic. At least 3 servers walked by our table but no one picked up our salad bowl leftovers sadly. The servers seemed to enjoy standing around talking to each other. Ours did not check back on us until the end in which we were pretty done with our visit and ready to go. Even the onion rings were soft not crispy. Geez. I would choose \"In and Out \" any day over this place."

In fact, I left zero tip last time, which as a person who spent 25 years in Vegas, is unheard of!  \n\nThe shakes never come until after you have had your meal for some time.  This leaves you nothing to drink as you start to eat.  The shakes should be easy and quick, they require no cooking!\n\nThen, the waitress leaves you --but never comes back.  On top of that, she won't take your credit card, you have to go STAND IN LINE--because really, that is what we all love to do at a restaurant, right?\n\nSo if they could improve service, this would be a five star.
