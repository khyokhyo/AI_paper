            "review": "Formerly locals, we went looking for a traditional restaurant away from the modern Strip. We found it and loved it.\n\nSummary: A bit pricey, lovely service, and great food.\n\nStarted with cocktails: perfectly made cosmo and Manhattan. Bread was delicious, followed by the escargot. Huge snails prepared perfectly! Next, we both had the prepared-fresh-at-the-table Caesar salads. Oh, my, these were the best. We both ordered filets (her 8 oz; mine 12 oz) cooked to medium-rare perfection. We split a twice-baked potato and simply had no room for dessert. With a glass of wine each, the total (before tip) was just a hair under two bills. Not Ruth's Chris, but not Outback, either. I'd say the value for the experience (old school room with dressed-up waitstaff and Sinatra on the sound system in an otherwise quiet room) is spot-on."

Also took pictures in Frank Sinatra's booth which is next to Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr's Booths...  \nWhat?  That's not enough to???  \nOk... Let me tell you that the service was wonderful and the food was amazing!!!\nWe had Steak, HUGE Lobster Tail, Caesar Salad, Creamed Corn, great drinks and for desert we had the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the Flaming Cherries Jubilee which is prepared Tableside!!!! It was hard to choose between that and the Bananas Foster which is also prepared Tableside....\nNext time I'm in Vegas I am definitely going back!"

I settled, and I use the term loosely there, on the toasted ravioli, which was AMAZING!!! So creamy, and complimented by a great marinara. \nEveryone else seemed to enjoy their flesh, so no complaints there. \n\nThe wait staff and hostess were so friendly! I especially loved the hostess, who was joking around with us and very helpful in getting us a cab after dinner. Definitely go here on your birthday. It'll be very \"explosive\"..."

            "review": "Golden Steer Steakhouse is THE BEST steakhouse in Las Vegas and my family's personal favorite. Since the very first time we tried the oldest steakhouse in Las Vegas, we knew it would be our regular spot for special occasions and any day that ended in Y. We always always always ask for Tom because Tom gets it. We live in Las Vegas and have been in the service industry for many years so take it from us when we say the service is unmatched when we have Tom as our server. Frankly, the service is unmatched when Tom can't be our server but he's still in the building and coming over to our table knowing we requested him and checking in on us. Every time I send people to Golden Steer, I send them to Tom, and every time he doesn't disappoint. The most recent visit was just a couple of days ago and my friends were so impressed with the service that at one point someone said they totally expected someone from the waitstaff to come over with a toothbrush and clean our teeth. Let me not forget to mention the food. I don't really like prime rib, my husband loves prime rib. I now love prime rib at Golden Steer. We usually share the 24oz Jim Cut Prime Rib because the massive piece of meat that comes out to the table in all its perfection is more than enough to share between two people, especially when you order the largest baked potato in Las Vegas and the twice baked potato and a side of mushrooms. Don't forget to start with the fresh Caesar salad that they make table side for your enjoyment as well as starting with any of their amazing appetizers like the lump crab cakes or the toasted ravioli. Don't waste your time and money going to those heavily marketed, overpriced steakhouses on the strip. You want to try Golden Steer before your time in Las Vegas is over! Let them know if you're celebrating an event, they will make it a night you'll never forget!"

            "review": "I agree with Fred T. \nIn fact I might go further to say that Chef Ramsey, or Chef Irvine might need to shake up the staff in the kitchen. \n\nThe mushrooms tasted like they had been steamed, and had a slimy texture to them. \n    I ate only one, leaving the rest, and pictured that if this were Restaurant Impossible, Robert Irvine would have promptly spit it out. \nI had to keep from being rude, and spitting it out.  I found it Gross !\n\nMy husband had a steak, and ordered the onions to go with it. \n    The onions were cooked to transparency but not caramelized. ( Sad )\n\nAlso, they tasted like someone had tried to thicken them with flour. If you try to make a roux, it needs to be thoroughly cooked, so it looses the nasty taste of flour. Yuck!\n\nMy broccoli was steamed nicely, with a squeeze of lemon on it. That was alright. \n\nOver all, I would not go back. \n\nThere are so many better places for me to spend my money at. \nSorry - outdated."

            "review": "I went here with a few friends on friday and our experience on this night moved me to make this my first review.  First off, I'm a fan of this place, I've been here a few times.  It's a local steakhouse, interesting history, a real old school Vegas feel and definitely a place to try if you're looking for something cool and different in ambiance in LV.  \n\nSo the service is eh, average.  Although the host was excited we were there, the waiter was less than friendly, robotic, interested in taking our order, and moving on to the next table. \n\nThe food was good, traditional steak, american and some italian pasta dishes.  We ordered the escargot, crab cakes and calamari.  The escargot were good, buttery and garlic-y.  The crab cakes big, nice and calamari was just ok.  I tried the lobster bisque and it was delicious.  Everyone had a some sort of steak and we shared the asparagus, which were done very well with a nice buttery hollandaise and also mashed potatoes.\n\nWhen we got our steaks, one was wrong, not just grilled wrong but the wrong cut.  After a 10 minute wait the correct steak was brought out.  And it was disappointing that when the bill came out, we were charged for that steak despite the inconvenience and error on their part....and our starving guest having to wait for his food!  \n\nThe Golden Steer has been around forever and obviously do things well and it is a must try place.  In the future though, I may try other local steakhouses unless I'm dragged here again by a GS virgin.  This experience was less than golden so I rate it 3 stars until they fully win me over again."

I love the decor of this place. Lots of booths. Warm, dark and really really comfortable dim lighting. \n\nThe food. You ask?\n\nBone in ribeye - Soooo  gooood!!!! Cooked to medium rare perfection.very flavorful steak. \n\nFilet - pink juicy center. Go meat.\n\nMushrooms - the sauce was awesome. \n\n2x baked potato - its ok... this put our meal to  carbohydrate overload. I bit too much food I think for two people. \n\nOverall, my experience here was pretty good. I'm pretty sure that I will be back.\n\nNote: They have gaming machines at the bar."

The oldest restaurant in Las Vegas.  \n\nThe steaks are very good but not the very best I've been served in town.  The sides were small. Our server made up for any issues and was great.

For entrees we had ribeye and fillet. Both ok...not bad but nothing special. Wine list was just ok. Nothing was bad but the prices were similar to higher end steak restaurants and food just wasn't that good. I'd prefer to go to Del Friscos or several other places. The live piano/singer in the bar was nice."

            "review": "While the steak and table side Cesar Salad was perfection, NOTHING else at this restaurant was even close to acceptable.  From the moment we arrived, until we left, our service was simply HORRIBLE. First, at the hostess stand the hostess stood glaring at her computer screen as we stood waiting to be acknowledged. Never did acknowledge us, so we turned around and went to the bar. 2 cocktails (a beer and a wine) 17 bucks, gave the older man bartender a 20 and he NEVER CAME BACK WITH OUR CHANGE! The assumption that, that was his tip was rude and in very bad service and bad form. Of course he was going to get that as his tip, but to assume. BAD!  VERY BAD. Its stealing! And if he \"forgot\" even worse, he shouldn't be working at such a restaurant as the Golden Steer.  So we went back to the stand and the \"harried\" hostess was able to accommodate our reservation, clueless as to our earlier \"encounter\".  The food service was slow, wreck-less (no refills of anything: water, bread, butter, coffee, or up-sell cocktails!), and the removal of dirty plates never happened. We stacked our plates to get them out of our way after sitting empty in front of us for 15 minutes. \nThe Prime aged 20 oz. T Bone was very good, as was the Cesar Salad. AS FOR the desert - forget it!! I wanted REAL NY cheesecake: I got Sara Lee...Im almost positive; NOT restaurant QUALITY in the least.  Coffee arrived bitter, luke warm, and no refills were offered. \nIn closing, Id skip Golden Steer. There are wayyyyy too many fine steak house in Vegas to be bothered with this dinosaur."

            "review": "FEAR THE STEER\n\nWe ventured here under the assumption that this was a high quality steakhouse and restaurant. The atmosphere didn't disappoint. Unfortunately, everything else did. If you decide to enter this establishment in anything less than full formal attire, you will be seated in a separate dining area hidden in the dank back corner of the restaurant. Soon after segregating you, they proceed to offer the quickest meal service possible to kick you out the door as if your money is no good there. If you order food that would normally be served tableside, don't be shocked to find it is pre-plated as if your highschool cafeteria lady had slopped it on like hamburger helper. \n\nAt this point I assume the staff just came off the boat fresh from a farm in Russia. Naturally I order a Moscow Mule. So the appetiser wasn't their fort\u00e9, how could they possibly screw up a cocktail right? I'm not sure what they brought me, but it tasted like a glass full of aromatic bitters. If that fancies you, skip the beer at the steer and go for the mule! \n\nMain course time. As they bring my plate with my New York and Crab legs, they are kind enough to offer me a complimentary briss. The sharp steak knife is hurled at my crotch like a trigger happy Rabbi trying to fulfil his quota for the month. Almost joining the Lance Armstrong club is truly what tipped the scales and inspired this review. \n\nPlease do yourself a favour, go to Outbacks and stear clear of the steer."

A bit in the pricey side dropped a pretty penny for dinner and a few bottles of wine for 4 of us. The history behind this establishment is very interesting as the Mobb used to frequent this restaurant often. The service was great our waiters were on point, yes you have to be patient as the other reviews stated. This is the kind of place you come to for dinner and sit and chat and enjoy the ambience and have some wine. We were there for 3 hours. The rib eye steak was cooked to perfection, oysters Rockefeller were delicious and the lamb chops were a favorite. It's dimly lit and old school decor with lots of historic memorabilia. We will definitely return!"

            "review": "Inside this unassuming exterior is a time machine of when the rat pack ran the streets of Vegas.  As we entered, we were greeted by a host and hostess, dressed in formal attire and intent on service.  We felt genuinely welcome and were escorted to one of the dining rooms.  The low-light ambiance made it feel private and red booths with plaques reserved for luminaries like Muhammad Ali and Joe DiMaggio ringed the walls with tables in the middle.  \n\nSeated quickly, we perused the menu.  It featured items that are not for casual dining.  Rather this place is a treat for those who have discerning tastes and expect excellent service.  Our main server, Tom reminded me of a classic Jersey boy - to the point.  No fluff.  All business.  Not that he's unfriendly.  That's far from the case.  It just felt like the kind of guy Sinatra would want at his table.  Another gem was Fabian.  He also assisted us and had almost a Hawaiian laid-back vibe to him.  Again, he was very attentive and requests were quickly met.  We felt like there was no rush.  That the experience was one to be savored.\n\nWe ordered the bone in ribeye, asparagus, surf and turf Combo with fillet mignon and crab.  For sides we also had the French onion soup and cesar salad.  Bread with butter was on the table to take the edge off while we waited.  The salad and steaks either met or slightly exceeded expectations for the investment.  We had them medium rare and medium.  Both were cooked appropriately and obviously seared to lock in juices.  Both were tender and flavorful.  Unlike some other steak houses, these were seasoned minimally to allow the customer to suit his/her tastes.  The bread was nothing spectacular.  Good, but unremarkable.  The asparagus was similar.  Using the lemon and adding some salt really raised it up a notch.  The crab was quite good, A nice touch was they split and grilled some of the legs.  It was a great counterpoint to the other traditional legs served with the meal.  The slightly crunchy texture was delightful.\n\nHowever, the star of the evening was the French onion soup.  This masterpiece had us both raving.  The broth was very flavorful and the cheese expertly melted.  The thick layer ensured that one could have cheese with the soup even after the initial spoonfuls.  \n\nAll the ingredients used were fresh and of the highest caliber.\n\nWe finished the night with the cherries jubilee.  Fabian attended us again and created the wonderful flaming display.  Always looking for improvement, my wife asked for some chocolate to go with it.  Unhesitatingly, Fabian brought out not only chocolate, but a raspberry topping as well.  He knocked it out of the park with the raspberry addition.  It was spectacular.\n\nIt was little touches like Fabian's thoughtfulness, and Tom's chutzpah that made the evening special.  Every person there was part of a team and their goal was the immediate and total satisfaction of the diner.  Though there may be hipper and newer steakhouses - the Golden Steer set the standard.  You don't have to be new and hip if you have brilliance in the basics."

A good, old-fashion steakhouse serving a good piece of meat and traditional sides that are very yummy! The creamy corn, mashed potaotes and mushrooms are delicious! My petit filet was cooked perfectly and my vodka tonic was just right (refilled at the right time too!). I will say that the salad was not very good - so I would either skip it or try the table side ceaser salad (maybe next time)....\n\nIt looks funny from the outside, but has cool history inside (this is where the Rat Pack dined - can't get any cooler than that :)  I love the dim lighting - perfect for a nice dinner. Oh! and their golden cow sign outside is just funny! You must appreciate this place for what it is - a classic steakhouse..."

Auntie order oysters Rockefeller and a grey goose martini she gives it a five for both of those.  Her husband ordered ribeye as did my husband.  Both felt the meat flavor was good and gave theirs 4 stars although they couldn't cut with a butter knife.  mom ordered a combo of crab legs and petite filet she thought her steak was a 3 and her crab legs tasteless like they had been frozen and then put under the broiler.  I am vegetarian I usually love the sides but I give it a 1.  The creamed spinach had an odd spice in it like anise or some strong flavor we all couldn't identify.  The asparagus was steamed and cold they brought us more that was warm but had a bitter sour flavor,  we couldn't eat it.  The $9 baked potato was a 1.50 potato.  I expected the skin to have a nice crust it didn't.  I expected it to be served with butter, sour cream and chives.  It was served with sour cream and margarine.  The French onion soup my husband said tasted like Sysco no flavor.  The salad was iceberg and large but not much too it a few garbanzo beans and tomorrow pieces.  The bread was French loaves but dry and flavorless."

Get straight to the point, the meal and staffs friendliness was more than our expectations.  Sitting in the Ali booth, we were greeted by such a entertaining server who started us with our cocktails, followed by a seafood tower and some wonderful steaks.

This place definitely holds their weight. From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but the inside is nice enough. I called to see if a reservation was needed and the woman that answered the phone was a little punchy. She gave me the info but made me work for it. \n\nWhen we arrived we noticed a lot of the other customers were very casual. It was warm out so my companion was happy to leave his coat and tie in the car. \n\nI ordered the filet and crab legs. I think it came with a salad, or it was extra I'm not sure.... Either was the salad was over priced. Just a boring mix if basic lettuce and dressing. I will skip the salad next time. \nThe filet was cooked perfectly and very tender. Crab legs were opened and very easy to eat. A lot of meat per leg. Steak fries were pretty good as were the asparagus. All and all a pretty nice meal, although slightly overpriced."

The service is impecable but a little slow, but I don't mind that when i am spending a decent amount for dinner.   The last time I went was with a girlfriend, who loves to flirt and we got free bananas foster!  \n\nThe food is some of the best food that I have had in Vegas.  I have had the escargot here and it is pretty tasty.  We always order the table side caesar and it is fantastic because the dressing is made from scratch right in front of you.  I don't usually order caesar salad because more times than not it is from a bottle and tastes terrible.  The steaks are very tender and flavorful and the sides are big enough to share.  The bananas foster is excellent and is also served tableside.  They add a little orange zest to the sauce, which I have never seen before, but it adds a nice little zing to the dish.  \n\nWe love taking out of towners here for dinner mainly because it is fun to reserve the rat pack booths, but next time I will request Elvis's booth (just found out that he used to eat there).  Love the old timey vegas ambiance!"

If you know what i mean .The filet my friend ordered was perfect but my ribeye was something i honestly could have made better at home. For a dry aged 22 ounce ribeye i expected to be knocked out. It didn't happen. It reminded me of a steak cooked at Denny's or a roadside diner.The cream spinach was soupy and although it tasted delicious the texture was off. I chose this placed based on a locals recommendation. I think that local needs to explore other steak houses. Good ..... but not knock your socks off great.  Thus 3 stars."

To keep this short and sweet, the food selection was average and the quality was average - with over 25 other steak houses that I've eaten at in the last 5 and a half years in Vegas, I won't be coming back for awhile. The service was average. There was nothing to write home about; for my money the Steak House at Circus Circus had similar ambience but far superior food and quality and yes, value for the money."

            "review": "I love this place for the classic, old-school Vegas atmosphere. We went on a very slow night, and had the pleasure of being seated at Oscar Goodman's booth (soon to be Carolyn's booth, our waiter informed us), while the only other diners in the restaurant included an Elvis impersonator at the booth behind us. Frank Sinatra music played in the background. Bring in the showgirls. So Vegas.\n\nCredit goes to our server for making the experience so memorable. He's been there for 33 years and shared a little of the restaurant's history with us. It's refreshing to see a truly professional front waiter, and I get a kick out of seeing my food served off a gueridon, as it reminds me of the horrors of a dining room service class I had to complete in culinary school.\n\nOh, right, and the food. My husband enjoyed his prime rib and twice baked potato. There's no room for a whiny vegetarian in a steakhouse, and I was perfectly content with my chopped green salad with garbanzo beans and housemade creamy Roquefort dressing and a large portion of fresh green asparagus with Hollandaise sauce. The garlic bread with cheese was also very tasty. \n\nThis is the kind of place I would love to take a visitor from out of town. I'm dying to go back and try a dessert prepared tableside (another culinary school memory), so hopefully some touristy people come soon!"

However, the service wasn't what you would expect from a restaurant like this. We were never offered refills and they watched like hawks to take our plates as soon as they thought we might be finished. I expected more from this place as far as service.\n\nEven without the great service, they offer a vintage Vegas feel that is getting harder to find! I would recommend this restaurant to someone looking for a piece of Vegas history, not necessarily looking for a nice dinner with a good steak."

As I looked around, all the other tables were marked with famous actors' names. Whenever a certain actor comes into the restaurant to eat, they get to eat at their table. It's pretty neat. Clint Eastwood's table was right across from ours, so I went over there and sat down. It sounds weird, but it was kind of cool to be sitting at Clint Eastwood's table and where he had sat and dined.\n\nThe restaurant has an old fashioned feel to it. It has wood paneling and the lights are dimmed down with Sinatra playing in the background. All the staff were wearing tuxedo's. Don't worry though, I ate in t-shirt and shorts. I felt a little out of place.\n\nThe first thing that really impressed me was that when we ordered their famous Caesar salad, the waiter mixed the dressing and lettuce right in front of us. It was one of the best salads that I've had in a long time.\n\nIf you love prime rib, this is the place to go! The Golden Steer is famous for it and they do not disappoint. When I cut through the steak, it felt like butter. The steak was cooked perfectly and I can say without a doubt, that it was the best prime rib that I've ever had.\n\nCoupled with the history and the outstanding food, I can't think of better dining experiences. Every time someone asks me for a dining suggestion in Vegas, I always mention this restaurant. It is a little out of the way, but it is the perfect getaway to the hustle and bustle of the strip."

This old school steakhouse is a true gem , simply the classic days of vegas ,with dim lighting ,rounded red and black booths surrounding the dining areas. Just to step into this time capsule  where the great performers of the past dined was truly a memorable experience especially from a change of pace from the newer overrated trendy joints.  The best steak I have ever had ( NY 16OZ )  along with a fantastic tableside prepared caesar salad and all the great side dishes.  Everything was outstanding  from the desserts,drinks , atmosphere as well as the friendly service  from all the staff which was top tier and of course our  many thanks go out  to Fernando , the Maitre d'  who entertained us with his funny humor  and out of this world hospitality . It was like a dinner and a show all in one as well as  some good laughs and conversation with some nice folks across the table from us . To sum it up , great food, great service and great feel of the ambiance of  old classic vegas .  It was a perfect dining experience to end the perfect weekend  . When in town guaranteed to be back for sure   !!!"

There are even plaques next to the booths they regularly sat at. (Yeah, I totally went and sat in the Elvis booth.) 5 stars.\n\nWhen you walk in, there's a bar area with gaming on the bar and some couches and whatnot. \n\nWe were greeted and seated promptly. The place was virtually empty on a weeknight.\n\nOur waiter was friendly, but the service just wasn't what one would expect of an old-school establishment, nor was it on par with the service at other Strip establishments. I love the old-school places where they fold your napkin for you if you get up and use the restroom, where the courses are properly timed, where the food is held and not brought to the table of everyone isn't there (because someone went to the restroom), etc. But alas, this place did not offer that sort of classy service. 2 stars.\n\nWe started with the Caesar salad and French onion soup. The salad is made table side and was $12 a person. It was crazy delicious. Easily one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had. 5 stars. The French onion soup was also yummy. Bubbly and full of cheese. 4 stars.\n\nBefore I was even done eating the salad (and whilst I was in the restroom), the steak was delivered. We opted to share the 22oz ribeye. At $50-some bucks, it's a big steak for a relatively low price (by comparison). But it wasn't all the great. It certainly wasn't bad and was cooked exactly as we ordered it. But it just didn't have a lot of flavor to it. 3 stars. Shoulda ordered the filet...\n\nTo go with the steak, we ordered the bernaise and peppercorn sauces. Both were rather ho-hum. 3 stars.\n\nWe also ordered the twice baked potato at the waiter's suggestion. It was overdone and not particularly flavorful. 2 stars.\n\nWith the Groupon, the price we paid wasn't too bad. But I gotta say, had we paid full price, I wouldn't have thought it worth it.\n\nThe main attraction here is the ambiance and history. The food is alright, but there are far better steak places around town."

They make the salad dressing table side as well as the banana flamb\u00e9!! Highly recommend both and the escargot was sooooo delicious. The cream corn is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! I'm usually not a sweets fan but I loved this dish. \n\nScot and a few others whose names I, regretfully, didn't get, were just so accommodating.

The ambiance really makes you feel as if you are sitting across from an old time vegas mobster having a steak dinner.  Impeccable service from the moment we walked in to moment we left. I was impressed by one of what I would call a bus boy, he was quite young but his service was on par with someone who has been in that type of service industry for many years. I am sure you have heard enough about that, I know you all want to hear about the food.  Most everything is served Al la carte, I love this aspect because I can choose what I want with my meal. I started with the French onion soup.  It was so tasty I dreamt about it that night,  the cheeses stretches and stretches, I think they should supply scissors to cut it. I choose to have the baked Alaskan salmon with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. The salmon comes with a small serving of rice pilaf. The gravy the mushrooms comes served in is delctable. The salmon has a nice crust to it. They also have a wide variety of desserts, bananas foster and cherries jubilee are made and served table side. Even the coffee we finished the meal off with was delicious, strong and robust.  I will definitely be going back. This is an amazing place for a special date or to just feel the old nostalgic Vegas."

This place failed on many levels tonight. Nobody I know will ever dine here. I am born and raised in Las Vegas and I work at the best restaurant in the city. Get it together Golden Steer!!!!"

The shrimp was dirty, the twice baked potato was salty as hell (I couldn't even eat it, had to have them take it back), the steak was full of fat & grissle, and my friend king crab was salty as hell too!! They messed up our bill adding a extra $50 for something we didn't buy, the waiter was kinda rude.. But we was the only blacks in there so maybe that's why all this occurred. With all the great reviews I can't understand why it was that bad! I have it 2 stars because it beautiful inside and the calamari was great!"

It has been open since 1958 and has a really great \"rat pack\" feel to it, which is appropriate considering Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Elvis, etc. came here often. Each table has a plaque behind it with a celebrity name of someone who dined at that spot; we sat at the Mickey Rooney table. Service is very professional with career waiters in tuxedos. One waiter has been there for 30 years. I had the prime rib, which is their specialty (they have a number of other beef cuts too). It was the best prime rib I have ever had...about an inch and a quarter thick and big. You will find a lot of classic steak house dishes here...tomato & blue cheese salad, creamed spinach, french onion soup, etc. All are very tasty and far more than routine. Most salads and desserts are made at your table by the waiters. The place has a very grown up vibe, not really a place for kids. Although there were a couple of people dining in shorts and t-shirts, I would advise guests to get in the spirit of the place; grow up and dress up! It's not cheap; prime rib alone is $35, add on all sides, appetizers & drinks, etc. Lobster and filet mignon combo was listed that night at $95. That said, I felt the experience was well worth it. I will definitely go back."

They can pretty much phone it in -- which the waiters do, or did on this particular night. But while the service and starters were crap, the steak really was wonderful. I was pleasantly surprised after such a poor start. I had a bone-in rib-eye, packed with flavor and tender. Friends enjoyed their fillet mignon as well. The steaks made up for the whole night. The asparagus and mash were pretty decent, though the cream of spinach was watery and the worst I've had anywhere. \n\nI came for the experience as much as the food and it was 'interesting,' in a good way There was a Marylin lookalike kicking around, and a sign above our booth told us Joe DiMaggio used to eat where we were sitting. Still a formal dining experience but with a bit of kitsch thrown in.\n \nIs it possible for waiters to be very nice and act like they don't give a crap at the same time? Pretty much what they managed here. We got no service for a half hour and then four guys came by in quick succession. One waiter told us he was from Belarus (I think) and then a Mexican waiter came by, and then the Belarus guy came back and said, 'You're all white folks so don't listen to what the Mexican says'. He was joking, they were friends, I guess, but it was inappropriate enough to add to the surreal humor of the evening.\n\nI wouldn't rush back because of the service and the sides/starters -- the salad and calamari we started with were decidedly average -- but really, the steak saved it and got them from 2 stars to 3. And that's what you go there for after all."

When you walk through the front door, you are transported back to the 1950s.  Back in the 50s and 60s, this was THE place to go for a great steak dinner.  When you are eating, you keep looking over your shoulder to see if Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr. had just walked in.  It is just way too cool in my book.\n\nSo back in the old days of Vegas, all of the Vegas Elite came here and had their own table.  If you were anyone, you had a table with your name on it saving your seat.  This is one of the cool leftovers from that era still in the restaurant.  You can request to sit at Elvis', Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin (my favorite Rat Packer, oh Dean-o I love you!), and numerous other celebrity tables.  My mom is the biggest Elvis fan in the world, so when I took her here for her birthday last year and got the Elvis table, she almost cried.  It is fun to have something fun in common with a superstar from yesteryear, in if it is just sitting at the same table at a great restaurant.\n\nOn top of the coolness factor, the steaks speak for themselves too.  I mean when the smallest steak on the menu is 12oz, you know you are in for a feast!  Last time I was here, i ordered the Prime Rib and it came out on its own plate because there was no room for anything else on the plate.  The Prime Rib was even hanging over the side in more than one place.  I only made a small dent in it and ended up taking it home and it turned into 2 more meals at home.  Now that is some serious MEAT.  Yum and drool all at the same time.\n\nAnother awesome aspect of this restaurant is the table side service for the desserts.  This is one of the only places left in the world that does flaming Cherries Jubilee and Bananas Fosters at your table, flames and all.  It is such a fun time watching your server make your dessert right there for you.  And seriously, how doesn't like desserts on fire right in front of you?\n\nMy absolute favorite part of this place is if you can go on a slow night when the owner is on property.  The owner is this very nice lady who will make friends with you as soon as she meets you.  I have been several times and she will always come by and just sit down with us at the table.  She will tell you all sorts of stories about interesting things that has happened at the place.  There are even some ghost stories about the place.  And yes, weird stuff still happens there.  BOO!  Now that is a fun dinner to have, steaks and ghosts!\n\nSo if you want to experience Old Vegas, eat a huge steak, have a flaming dessert, and maybe get spooked by a spook, this is your joint.  Go check it out and support a local legend."

            "review": "If dinning out is about the experience then our evening was about learning to cope with disappointment.  And I have to tell you, no one was more disappointed than our waiter at having us for guests.  \n\nIt started with the very obvious disdain most waiters have for us when we send a wine list away.  My personal feeling is they think because we're young and we're not ordering wine we're going to be cheap.  That's neither here nor there, but it's a common theme in higher end restaurants that we run into, and it was no different here.  \n\nI ordered a cocktail, and my father ordered a beer, and then we found that we had a seesaw for a table.  I tried to stop the waiter but he seemed really busy trying to work out in his head the minimum number of times he needed to stop at our table and still make a decent tip.  \n\nWhen it came time to order we asked if there were any specials or recommendations and we were told that everything was special.  Super helpful bro, especially when I was trying to wrangle two other indecisive orderers.  Our order failed to impress our waiter though as got bored  about halfway through it and started looking at the wall to see if there was any way it was more interesting than us.  It must have been, but he showed real grit when he forced his glance back to our table to take down the rest or our order.  \n\nOur premade salad came out to the table right around the same time as cart was rolling up to the table next to us.  They do table side Caesar salad prep?  Who knew?  I would consider that something special to recommend to a customer, but I guess we just weren't good enough for him to tell us about it.  \n\nThe escargot was poorly done, with a mystery spice ruining what should be a very simple dish.  We think it was coriander.  \n\nWe then fought with the server bringing our main course out for table space and no one seemed to want to come and clear off any plates on our table.  We resorted to busing the table ourselves and leaving a neat stack of plates on the edge of the table.  We would have asked our waiter, but again, he was probably in the back lamenting to the chefs about what a terrible table he had. \n\nWhen the stakes came out we forgot momentarily about dirty seats, the leaning tower of plates and the see-saw table because these stakes were phenomenal. Well portioned, well seasoned and cooked.  We almost didn't care the broccoli came out cold because we were too enamored with our stakes.    My wife and dad had a filet, and I had the rib-eye.  It really was the saving grace the experience.  \n\nGluttons for punishment, or maybe like a 10 year old son trying to earn his fathers approval, we stayed for coffee and dessert.  We had the Bananas Foster and Cheesecake with fireworks on it since we were celebrating my dads birthday.  The Bananas are served table-side with ice cream and are very good, the cheesecake is cheesecake, and the coffee was coffee.  \n\nAll kidding aside though, when bills start to get up in the $100 per person range there is a level of service that is expected, and we did not receive anything close to that level of service.  I've had better service at an Outback and I hope this was just a one off, but it's disappointing when a poor experience detracts from an otherwise good meal."

I think I would have preferred the dressing come out of a bottle since it was so bland, I couldn't tell it was Caesar.

I don't give up though and out came my monster of a prime rib.  Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed.  The meat was full of tendons and gristle, out of the 24 ounces only about 10 was edible.  Sadly, the whipped potatoes were the highlight of the meal.\n\nWe did feel P.I.M.P. leaving the restaurant in their complimentary limo yet the free ride wasn't redeeming enough."

Inside its beautiful....old school to the nth degree. photos of rat packers are everywhere..waiters wear tuxedos...hostess is especially nice and friendly....Sinatra music plays softly on the speakers...just wish the food would live up to the ambiance they create. Not that the food is bad...but its very expensive and for what they charge it should be better! we started with an  old fashion and manhattan cocktails and were all pleased. Caesar salad was made tableside and received rave reviews. French onion soup was tasty. steaks were fine.....$52 for a rib eye!! NY strip clocked in at $48! the twice baked potato was delicious while beware of the creamed spinach...my daughter thought it was \"tainted\". highlight of the meal was probably the bananas foster..again prepared tableside and enough to share...what a dessert! the entire experience is positive...the meal part..not so much..just typical. get off the strip just  to say you've been there. Its a slice of las vegas that's hard to find anymore."

            "review": "The Golden Steer is a total old school Vegas steakhouse experience. We decided to go on a whim and had no problem making same day reservations. \n\nThe Steer is located on Sahara between the I-15 and Las Vegas Blvd in a strip mall. It doesn't look like much on the outside but the inside is quite a surprise. Walking through the double wood doors you are taken back to old Vegas, I expected to see Frank and Sammy walk in any minute. The dark red booths, steer horns over the doorway and pictures of the rat pack and famous celebrities who have tables in their honor. \n\nWe were seated at Sammy Davis Jr's table with a signed picture of the Rat Pack on the wall behind us. Our server Scott came right over to welcome us and take our drink orders. For dinner we decided on the caesar salad, the 22 oz bone in rib eye, the twice baked potato and creamed spinach. The Steer has many table side preperations such as the caesar salad, chateaubriand, dover sole as well as desserts. \n\nBrian came over with his cart to prepare our table side caesars. Everything is made from scratch using an egg yolk, fresh garlic, EVOO and parmesan cheese. Although I wished it was served a little colder, it was one of the best caesars Ive had. Shortly after, the rest of the dinner arrived. The ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. I thought the quality was good, but Ive had much better steaks in my life. The twice baked potato was excellent with lots of cheese and bacon. The creamed spinach had an odd anise flavor that we did not care for and the spinach was barely warm so we sent it back. \n\nFor dessert we chose the table side bananas foster. At $30 for two I was expecting much more. Brian came back with his cart and started cooking the bananas with brown sugar and rum. He scooped it on to vanilla ice cream and set the dish in front of us. We were waiting for the second one but the one dish was for the two of us. It was quite small and way overpriced for bananas and ice cream although it was very good. \n\nThe ambience and history here is 5 stars. Service was also excellent and we enjoyed our table side preparations. Waters were always refilled without asking. I will definitely return, especially with out of town guests so they can experience \"old Vegas\" themselves."

Granted, we got there at the end of the night, but when you're dropping $200 at minimum on dinner and wine, the 9:00 seating should still get some pretty badass food. Seafood stuffed mushrooms were squishy, bland and sub-par to even crappy Red Lobster stuffed mushrooms. Tableside Caesar was a joke. Had a really nice bottle of pinot noir, so even with teh bad food, we pressed on to dinner. \n\nMy filet was overdone, underseasoned and grainy. His prime rib was repellant. You know that reason a lot of folks think prime rib is gross? His was it: raw, full of uncooked, glisteny fat and sitting in a pool of bloody 'au jus'. I couldn't even look at it. \n\nSo, so disappointed. Will never be back."

Great looking bar, lots of dark wood and comfortable chairs. We all sat around in the bar waiting for the rest of our group.

We will be returning here often for all of the above reasons. Also, I have bought many large dinners in high-end Las Vegas Steakhouses. But this was the first time I got out for less than $900 for 10 adults. Yes I dig this place."

There were so many things wrong with my dining experience it's hard to even figure out where to begin!\n\n1) SERVICE-- I went on a Sunday evening and sat at the bar so I could watch football. The poor bartender does everything here.  She had 9 people at the bar, was cleaning glasses, answering the phone,getting our food  AND she has to make all the drinks for the waiters. And when I say ALL the drinks, they come up to her for a COKE, they don't even have a fountain drink machine for the waiters to do it themselves.  Needless to say, it took her a while to get my food ordered. There also was a group of 3 guys that sat next to me that were ordering food and playing video poker too [hold that thought].\n\n2) DRINKS--They have video poker at the bar. Fine by me. THEY DON'T COMP your DRINKS at the bar. Unheard of in Vegas. I lost $40 bucks and still paid FULL price for my 2 glasses of wine.\n\n3) FOOD--Bread? They have bread here???? Based on the other reviews apparently they do. We didn't' see any bread at the bar- carb free for us! My meal came out before my salad. Noooo bueno.  Also, about 25 mins after I ordered my meal arrived. WHY so long you ask? Because the bartender has to leave the BAR and go get the food herself. I have never in my life seen a restaurant where the bartender goes and gets her own food.  The reasoning for my salad coming out late, the waiters were getting there before her, and since the Caesars are made to order I lucked out.  Let's talk about the food...I order the combination meal-petite fillet, salad, veggie, & shrimp scampi to the tune of $65. \n\nOutback has better steak then this place. It was really dry [see pix] there wasn't even any juice on the plate. When I think of shrimp scampi-garlic, white wine, shrimp, butter, and parsley comes to mind.  This was NOT that.  It was gelatinous kinda like shark fin soup & the tails were still on the 5 shrimp.  Side of broccoli extremely undercooked. It needed 2 or 3 more minutes in the microwave from where it came from.\n\nGuys next to me started laughing when my food arrived. Then I one upped them told them I bet their apps come out with their food....well I was sort of right. Their food came out, but there were no apps with it. So poor little bartender, now has to leave the bar, for about the 5th time [with 9 people at it PS-it only seats 12] and once again go get our food. \n\nPS- I complained about the order in which the food came out, hostess did come talk to me [she might have been the manager] instead of apologizing, offering me a dessert, taking off a glass of wine, she told the bartender if she starts to get behind let her know and she'll help out.  I mentioned to her too the same thing happened to the guys next to me. She offered no apologies and didn't even go speak with them.\n\nMind you we are drinking, eating, AND playing at this place.  My meal cost me well over $125 and was worth about $30 in my opinion.\n\nAgain STK or Botero are much better options. I also have no idea how anyone else had a GOOD experience here as this might be the worst experience I've had in Vegas and maybe in a restaurant period."

The staff is attentive and dressed to impress. The food is executed well. The bar tenders are lively and good for a story or joke if you're in off peak hours.\n\nWhile here you can confidently explore other options like Escargot, Oysters Rockefeller, or an Oscar topping for your filet.

But as I ate on, I hit spots on the steak that tasted chalky. I don't know what the deal was, but it wasn't right. It didn't even have the texture of meat! Luckily the steaks here are the size of a side of cow so I was able to share my bf's steak. \n\nThe chopped salad was so so. Not your typical steakhouse salad. The only thing steakhouse about this salad was the price. It had large pieces of lettuce, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, and lettuce. I didn't even finish it and I shared with my bf! \n\nThe service isn't great either. Our waiter was not attentive. We had to ask for refills twice. He basically dropped our food and never came back until he had something else to drop off. Overall, the experience was okay. For the price, I'd go elsewhere. \n\nAnd for those of you wondering about the bread basket.  That was average too. We were given three halves of a mini baguette.

Very typical steakhouse fare but low quality steaks, a really, really crappy $20+ Caesar Salad (maybe the worst I've ever had) ....everything else marginal. The stuffy waiter was telling me how their Black Peppercorn Sauce was similar to a Bordelaise Sauce.......not even ballpark. It truly added nothing to the meal and was very bland (and about $5 extra)......a baked potato with too much butter & sour cream can be had anywhere...or at home for pennies on the dollar. Their desserts were ordinary. \n\nFolks, there is nothing special about this place as far as I'm concerned. Decor is OK, certainly nothing to go out of your way for. \n\nI am not a snob foodie at all, however: I cannot really see the appeal of your typical everyday steakhouse anyway. The food  all seems the same whether its Ruth Crist, Mortons or the Golden Steer. I admit to not having tried some of the joints from famous names (Craft, etc). A steak plopped onto plate is pretty boring and lacks insperation, and I can do a better technical job of cooking it myself. \n\nIf you want some tasty beef \"on the cheap\", pass this place by and head out to Southpoint Casino where for $16 (total) you can have a pretty good slice of prime rib with all the trimmings.....and it is, by far, more delicious than this hole. Or I have heard good reviews for some of the other pricey places....just don't do this one......really.\n\nThe only people I would \"Steer\" here are unwelcome visitors, drunken tourists, superstar entertainers, and a few deserving others that I know of."

We struck up a terrific conversation with the maitre de one evening who graciously offered us a quick tour of the restaurant - I didn't want to interrupt the other diners so we asked him to share a story instead...he obliged and mentioned a back door a certain member of the infamous Rat Pack had to use. Fascinating to hear. \n\nBesides all the nostalgia this place is fantastic. I adore dimly lit dining rooms with those terrific naugahyde booths that line the perimeter.

Classic cocktails flow easily (plan for Uber or taxi, GS has them on speed dial).\n\nWe always finish our meals with the bananas Foster table side, it's a treat complete with banana liqueur, butter and brown sugar en flambe.\n\nSure there are other steak restaurants, but this one has history and a charm all its own.

It was also a bit too thick and began to form a skin pretty quickly. I expected much, much more.\n\nThe Caesar was a disappointment. (1) It was made in stages; the preparer actually walked away in the middle to do something else, then came back to finish. (2) It was made too soon... so it sat while I finished my soup. I felt rushed because of this and passed my soup on to one of my friends who wanted to try it, just to make room for the hovering staff to deliver the now wilted, warmish salad.\n\nThe great experiences:\n\nMy escargot were perfect. Tender, a lot of flavor, and with a generous portion of garlic butter without drowning in it. Simply prepared and presented, the meat was the shining star here; spot on.\n\nMy companions had the shrimp scampi with fettucini and a petite filet with a side of creamed spinach. The shrimp were large, tender, and done very well. The steak was cooked perfectly to order with just the right char on the outside. Very juicy, fantastic texture, and delicious. I didn't have the spinach (only because I was full off the escargot and tastes of the rest) but it was well received and, in fact, devoured promptly.\n\nThe wine service was done well and the bottle of Paso Robles cab sauv I chose was (of course! ;)) the perfect accompaniment to the meal. We were also gifted a Sebastiani as a second bottle. It was good, but nothing spectacular. The thought is what counts, yes, but - and I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth here - you are a steakhouse and touting your wines... serve us something you would tout and celebrate.\n\nThe creme brulee we shared was tasty. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nSo far, a solid 3-star experience. A-OK, and \"good.\"\n\nBut then...\n\nThe AMAZING experiences:\n\nThe overall service (minus the salad fiasco) was personal and friendly and engaging. Camacho and Jay and the gang want to be a part of your experience and take care of you old-school style. They are ingrained in the history of the place and are, by far, the main reason to dine here. They will, in between filling your glasses and placing your plates, fill you in on history (the good, the bad, the baudy) and are always quick with a smile, a handshake for the guys, and a wink for the gals. They truly enjoy what they do and it shows.\n\nIf you want energetic, you have it. If you want quiet and intimate, you can have that, too. Let them know what to create, and you will find the atmosphere you want. *THIS* is the reason it's a 4-star review/place (as many say, I would do 3.5 if I could). Let the staff take care of you. Be not afraid to make requests, have opinions, and let yourself enjoy the evening.\n\nPS - Camacho's special coffees (not for the under-21 crowd) are yumminess in a cup. ;)"

HOWEVER, I have gone to other steak houses and gotten fish and it was wonderful.  The sea bass at Flemings for example.  Having said that, I will give this place another chance and have a steak.\n\nWhat I didn't care for was our server.  He was not in a good mood and we felt it.  We ordered $130 bottle of champagne and he never brought a bucket of ice, we had to ask for it.  The place was crowded and it's a hard job, however when you pay good money for food, there are no excuses.  Suck it up and give Everyone your best.It wasn't just him either, while waiting in the lobby I spotted an old cappuccino machine, I asked an approaching waiter if it still worked and he just walked past me without a word.  I was the only person in the area, so he heard and saw me, he just ignored me."

Picture a generic and plain front with the strip mall look.\n\nWe were seated into a booth, Mickey Rooney's!, and looked around to find a pretty empty room. It was a Thursday night at 7pm so we expected a bit more traffic in there.\n\nThe service was attentive enough (even when the waiter spilled a beer on the seat next to me). \n\nCome to think of it, he apologized but provided nothing more than getting me an extra napkin to get the beer from the seat and my pants. I didn't press it as much as I should have. \n\nAn omen of things to come?\n\nWe skipped the starters since nothing was jumping out as us so we focused on the mains and sides.\n\nJosh got the prime rib. I got a T-bone. \n\nNeither of us were happy. \n\nBoth were ok to start, not bad, but not at all worth the price. We never felt that it was the best piece of meat we ever got in at a restaurant.  \n\nThere were no happy plates.\n\n(Moreover, we both felt a little \"off\" after finishing.)\n\nFor the sides, we got broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, and the whipped potatoes. I can't speak for the little trees but the mushrooms were good enough while the potatoes were too buttery. I only tasted butter.\n\nOur intention was there to try something off the strip and something historic. Next time in Vegas, and there always be a next time, I'll find some other old school place.\n\nSo, skip it. \n\n(I rounded up to 2 stars due to the fact it's been around so long.)"

Upon entering and being intimidatrd by thr dress code enforced sign we weren't greeted at all. After finding someone to recognize us we were seated and I immediately tried to redeem my Groupon. FYI my phone was acting up in this place so make sure you are able to pull up your groupon prior to ordering. We asked the waiter about their combo meals and holy wow they were almost all 100$ or more. Way more expensive than any other Steakhouse I've been to before. We ordered garlic bread and twice baked potato because of good reviews but I was sorely unimpressed. For $5 we got 3 pieces of dry garlic bread that was crumbly and overseasoned. The free bread is a wayyyyyyyyyy better deal. My gf and I ordered filet mignon which cam out burnt on the outside sitting in a pool of brown water w a single leafy garnish. Worst plating I have seen thus far. They do get one star because the center of my meat was pretty decent. The twice baked potato reminded me of the kind you can buy at the store in the freezer section and microwave. It was dry dry dry and just yuck! I didn't finish mine at all. During our meal we were sort of ignored by all of the staff which is quite odd as they spent plenty of time yacking to an elderly couple right next to us. The bill came and low and behold the guy that took our Groupon forgot to remove it from our bill. Even with a Groupon I thought I overpaid. I have to agree with others saying this place has old school prices for food that I guess is catered towards old people? As a local I will never be back nor refer anyone to this outfit."

The waiter spilled wine all over my table and several other servers dropped food tray lids, neatly dropped a salad bowl, and silverware.

The ambiance was nice--very old school Vegas--an older clientele. Lots of Rat Pack Music going. The service was fine, however we were disappointed in the food. My petite filet was cold and although it was cooked medium rare, like I had ordered, the cut of meat was not good. It seemed like a cheaper grade of beef than we had been served before at the Golden Steer. Also, I ordered fries that were supposed to be home cut, but were obviously frozen. My broccoli was raw. For the price we paid, we will have to reconsider & perhaps choose a more modern steakhouse with higher standards."

It's dark, red leather booths & staff that have probably been there since The Rat Pack frequented the joint. \nThe Food; my steak was lukewarm, and just missing something. We all agreed, the steaks were sub par. The potatoes weren't even good. How do you mess up a baked potato?? We ordered garlic bread & even that was blech!! \nBottom line; we won't be coming back.

I had never heard of this place & even was a bit skeptical when he first mentioned it and I've been to Vegas about 5x per year. How could I not have heard of it?? \n\n Amazing is what I describe this place as. We got there early. Chris had  a reservation he made the same day. The hostess was unable to find , which may have been a problem on a weekend night; But we sat at the bar and caught up about our day...& tried to warm the crotchedy bartender up. Fail on that. He's old school and seemed  stressed by his 10 or so patrons and staff. Premium liquors and he poured what he liked , it seemed. He had some good wines... No list at the bar..& almost grumpy when you ask for one..lol... BUT I do get a kick out of old codgers like this. So there was no way this guy was gonna get to me on the last night in Vegas. The bartender knew all the wines nonetheless;and pours a good pour. Impressive. Don't try carrying the tab over to the table.. Nope. He's not having that either. \n\nThe decor is very old Vegas .. A bit mafioso... Many celebs from the era of when have been here : Marilyn Monroe; Joe Dimaggio; Mario Andretti, to name just the few we saw over the booths named after them and the restaurant  has that feel to it. I personally love character in a place and you will find it here. We ordered the chopped salad... With the Roquefort dressing ... It was divine. The serving size just enough. My date got the ribeye and I the filet...  My usual , when I eat steak. The twice baked potatoe.. And we shared the creamed spinache.. We ordered a Rodney Strong Cabernet.. Offed the bottle and two extra dirty Martinis ; it's Vegas, right?! I can't tell you how amazing this meal was ... Not that I could fit another bite in... My boyfriend didn't want the meal to end without a dessert ... So we ordered my favorite creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e ... And shared it... Yummy... It's not as vanilla--y or creme de la creme as I recall in France but still good ... And bc the waiter liked us so much... He said it was on him... Cheers to that!.. Go there ready to drop some $$ ... It's ala carte ordering ... And this was easily a $180 meal... But oh so worth it... :-) I would say my return factor is 10-10; even with the grouchy bartender."

            "review": "The quintessential Vegas restaurant of yesteryear when the mobbed up town played host to the likes of Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr, and Old Blue Eyes himself (the guys whom the streets are named for).  Back when a steakhouse served steak and service meant jacket clad waiters prepared your salad, shelled your lobster, and flamb\u00e9ed your dessert tableside.\n\nThe Golden Steer brings it all to you.  Make no mistake, despite its location in the Badlands and it's tacky 1960's looking sign, this is a classic, \"elegant\" steakhouse.  Ballers of the past called this their kitchen, do not come looking for the $2.99 NY steak.  \n \nStraight to it, do NOT pass on jumbo shrimp cocktail.  Huge (U8), perfectly cooked and chilled, sweet Gulf shrimp served simply with a lemon and horseradish supercharged cocktail sauce, classic in every respect.  Add a gin martini and all is right with the world.      \n\nThe tableside Caesar salad as good as you want it to be.  Just chopped crisp romaine, raw egg, anchovy fillets, parm, and croutons.  Adjustments are made on the fly for personal preference so speak up.  A good French onion soup.  Beefy, load of caramelized onions.  Not as cheesy as hoped for but great taste.\n\nTo the steaks, all USDA Prime dry aged.  Well trimmed, tender, very even searing and always cooked to temp.  The T-bone and bone in rib eye very flavorful and though the char masks the umame finish, plenty of goodness to be enjoyed.  Next, the excellent prime rib.  Served with a deeply favored au jus and creamed horseradish.  Beefy, juicy, and just good eats.\n\nSimple sides (no truffle this or pancetta that).  Steamed asparagus, creamed spinach, giant baked potato with the works.  Portions are shareable.\n\nFinally the flamb\u00e9s.  Bananas foster and Cherries Jubilee are outstanding.  A great show and as classic as can be albeit a bit heavy on the liqueur flavorings.\n\nService is steakhouse friendly and efficient.  No complaints.\n\nWeak wine list for a steakhouse lacking vintage, varietal, and producer depth.   Fair markup.\n\nSometimes, you just need to embrace Vegas.  Luck Be a Lady after all.  Do it My Way.  As Time Goes By remember, That's Life and most importantly, The Best Is Yet To Come."

If you aren't old enough to remember back then you may want to make comments about how dated it looks and how uninspired the menu is.... so you should not even stop here but just head right over to Prime at the Bellagio.  If, however, you have a clue and enjoy this type experience, read on.\n\nThe first time I came (many years ago), it was slow so the lovely lady who takes care of seating gave me the whole story of how the guys from the Ratpack used to go there after their shows for dinner.  They even have the booths that each of them traditionally sat in marked with plaques.  These days it's rarely slow and I would suggest reservations.  For those goofs that somehow seem to think the world is supposed to make way for their last minute whims, there is a bar area where you can wait.\n\nStart with the seafood sampler but be sure to tell them for how many.  Not as much variety as some of the more elaborate offerings in Vegas, but not as expensive, either.\n\nFollow up with the traditional French onion soup for sure.  Traditional in the 1960's sense.  Perfectly acceptable if you know what to expect... if you're a snotty food snob, maybe not for you.\n\nThe steaks are great.  If you want to argue about level of doneness when it's brought to you, please educate yourself before doing so.  They will of course do their best to please you but I have been present more than once when a pompous ass tries to show off what they think they know about internal temps for different levels of doneness only to end up proving how little they actually know.\n\nI've never done desert here as I'm partial to Lappert's ice cream (another review to get done) and feel like the time for my driver to get into downtown is worth it.  I can say that the espresso is good and will send you on your way with a little energy to get moving after a heavy meal.\n\nAll in all this place is a great nostalgic experience for us older folks who appreciate the traditional and are not looking for the latest gastro-craze goofiness."

It was pretty expensive, about $100 a person and I don't mind paying for a nice meal as long as you get treated properly. There are so many great steakhouses in Vegas and being a local and industry person I've been all over and I won't be going back to Golden Steer just because the service was so poor. Everyone acted like they were at a funeral, no one smiled or made eye contact, the servers seemed like they didn't want to be bothered and it was a very unwelcoming vibe. A good expensive meal needs to be accompanied by good service but Golden Steer staff was rude and snobby.  It was such a disappointment because we were really looking forward to eating there and having a great experience. We won't be back and I hope the staff can cheer up and learn some guest service techniques 101 so they don't ruin the business."

I geek-ed myself up to go check this place out cause I'm a history buff.Food is not that good. I ordered a NY Strip ($40) medium, when I got the steak it was burned I mean burned, when your suppose to be eating a medium steak its' not suppose to taste like charcoal, it tasted like a low end steak. Mash Potatoes ($8) that I got wore horrible, I expected fresh made mash potatoes for the price that I was paying, they were definitely instant mash potatoes, no doubt. Salad ($8) I ordered with ranch was horrible, it was drowned in dressing and then when they cut the lettuce they put the bottom of the head in the salad and it's nasty, salad didn't taste fresh at all. All in all I spent $64 on a meal that was in all honesty worth $17. I was amazed at how when I'm paying $40 for a steak its burnt. Very Disappointed in the food.\n\nIn all honesty when you look at this place from the outside your expecting a cheaper steak house and you figure its old etc, But to pay $64 for a NY strip dinner is crazy, maybe that's why there was only 2 other tables in the restaurant. If they charge $64 for a steak dinner then Outback needs to charge $128 cause there NY steak dinner is light years better. \n\nLike I said don't spend money on the food WAY WAY overrated. If you want to see the place they do have a bar where you can have drinks and look at the place."

Get a steak-why order pasta or fish at a place known for its steaks!?!? And the steaks taste incredible!  This is traditional steakhouse food-no modern dining here.  Most steaks are about $35 average with NO sides!  Get the giant baked potato and tableside made Caesar Salad!  This place has been around since 1959 or so.  Sinatra is constantly on the muzak.  It is a block from the Sahara , so it is close to the strip."

This is where things started falling apart, it comes down to just crappy service. The waiters, dressed in tuxes gathered in a group outside the kitchen and showed little to no interest in providing any level of service. When a waiter did show up to take my coworkers drink order my coworker  asked if they had any IPA's to which the waiter said  that they had Heineken my coworker pointed out that this was not an IPA which the waiter then disputed. I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself. I can't say enough about how bad the service was I'm pretty easy going but I was pissed my the time we were done eating. The food was good which is why I'm giving them 2 stars otherwise it would be one star. \nWhen we were leaving  we told the hostess of our dissatisfaction and she took down our emails and assured us that we'd be taken care of and would receive some sort of compensation, over a week later this hasn't happened."

After eating dinner at the SLS and finding that there were no happy hour specials on Fridays we wandered onto Las Vegas BLVD - I saw the Golden Steer in the distance and was drawn into the light. \n\nWe walked in and were greeted by a tux with a furled brow. After explaining we just wanted few a drinks and we'd be out the door, he obliged and walked us over to the bar. This place is a true Vegas landmark with pictures of Mobsters, The Rat Pack, and Hollywood celebs adorning the walls. You get a real sense of old Vegas, where everyone knew your name and your drink. This place is so old school with the red vinyl seats and the golden accents everywhere; it makes the show \"Mad Men\" look like a modern day TV marvel. \n\nThe bartenders Patty and Blake were awesome, very friendly and willing to chat with us about the place. We ordered vodka sodas and shots right off the bat and after our second round, I started eyeballing the happy hour menu... \"One order of escargot please\"... Yes. I'm a big fan of this land dwelling mollusk, and whenever I see it on a menu, I have to order it. The Golden Steer's versions of these are very good. Swimming in butter and garlic sauce and not too chewy either, the snails simply melted in your mouth. The only thing is, I wish they came in their shells. These snails were served pre-shelled for easy consumption, where's the fun in that?\n\nThis was my first time here, but definitely not my last. It's time to make reservations and party like it's 1959!"

My friend went for the 22oz Ribeye while I opted for the leaner 16oz New York Strip. A giant glass of aged Chianti and a couple slices of warm bread later we received our meals. Aside from the red wine, our giant slabs of meat were the only contrast to our predominantly white dinner setup. It really makes the meal stand out, and for me to dive right in!\n\nBoth of our steaks were cooked to perfection and I was especially satisfied with mine. No need for extra garnishments, no steak sauce. Just pure, unadulterated meat. I really wish I could have ate it all but I easily hit my limit. I also wished that I had room for dessert after seeing a few of the waiters flambe some Cherries Jubilee right next to us.\n\nOur server was very attentive, informative and made sure our glasses of wine stayed full. His formality is top notch and really reflected the establishment well. I really appreciated the recommendations, if you're open minded, definitely hear the staff out when inquiring about what to order.\n\nAttentive and well-paced service accompanied by excellent food is a win-win for me, especially in a city where I always lose. I will definitely be back for more during my next visit in town!"

            "review": "I took my Dad here for his birthday. He was completely indifferent on where he wanted to go for his birthday, and we both love steak. I figured this place was historic in this town, so it'd be cool to say I have eaten here. Also, I had a living social deal that was soon to expire. For all those reasons, it just made sense to try it. The hostess was extremely friendly. She kinda set the tone for what should have been an excellent experience. The ambiance was also pretty sweet. It was exactly what you'd expect after hearing that this place has been around for a while, and the old time Vegas elites used to eat here. \n\nAfter those two huge pluses, the main drawback was the servers. The servers here are absolutely terrible. No personality whatsoever, no customer service, inattentive, and even molasses would get infuriated with impatience waiting for service. It was a perfect storm of what makes someone a shitty waiter. After your waiter takes your order, you might as well say goodbye because that's the last time you're gonna see him. Someone else brings your food, which in and of itself isn't really a big deal. Your food even arrives in a timely manner. But your waiter won't be back again for anything. Want a refill on your soda? Nope. Apparently, you aren't good enough for refills on your sodas here. At other restaurants the waiter makes sure everything is good with your order, not here. No, at Golden Steer, you're on your own to track a busboy down with any requests or issues you may have. Then you need to cross your fingers and hope for the best. They do however, keep up on your water glass. So you aren't gonna die of dehydration at least. Upon looking around the sea of seemingly disheartened geriatrics eating their meals all around us, I assumed that all those people came into the establishment as bright eyed, young go getters. Then they aged horribly waiting for their check to arrive, while simultaneously losing all the hope they once had in this world. I was convinced I was going to suffer the same fate. I even managed to flag down our waiter and gave him my living social voucher after we were done eating, only to have a completely unrelated waiter bring me my bill without any discount showing on it (for what felt like at least a half hour later). I think they were trying some kind of strange, crafty server scheme. Maybe they would take the $50 off the bill afterwards and split it. Who knows, maybe they just get easily confused when they each have a whopping three tables to attend to. \n\nThat whole terrible waiter experience completely took away any of the old school charm the place could have had, it also didn't represent the price they charge for their food (around $100 for two people without any discount). I have no problem paying for a great meal with great service, but this place left much to be desired. It seems awful that the one thing getting the least amount of attention in my review is the actual food itself, which was actually pretty decent. You can do a lot better for your money though. I would take the Palm steakhouse at Caesar's over this place any day of the week. Much much better service, and better food on top of it. I believe the pricing is even a little better there. I was gonna give this place three stars, but when I read the summary of a two star review, it summed it up perfectly. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" ... Cue \"That's what she said\" in 3...2...1.."

This gave my friend and I (two girls) a chance to peruse the menu, as we had been invited and didn't know much as to what to expect.  After the initial sticker shock on the prices of the prime steaks, she and I settled on sharing a 18 oz. prime rib au jus with horseradish cream (the smallest size they had; $40) and a Jumbo Baked Potato ($8.)  They were both delicious.   The wines were good and fairly priced per glass in the low teens.  We could hear each other converse which personally I appreciate.  I would have liked to try the authentic Caesar Salad ($12 per person) made table-side, but we really didn't think we could eat that much so we didn't order it.  If it cost a bit less - say $8 per person, maybe we would have tried it.  The service was attentive and not overbearing. \n \nI'd definitely come back.  I enjoyed the atmosphere of the Rat Pack era Las Vegas - the booths even have plaques with the names of the people who would reserve them, such as Dean Martin, Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra.  There was a man playing piano in the bar.  \n\nI would like to see this restaurant busier - by 11pm when we finished the place was pretty empty and it's as good as any of the more crowded places at the strip hotels.  People need to know that it's still there!  (Since 1958.)"

The oyster rockafeller, 2x baked potato & creamed spinach was delicious though. The \"special garlic bread\" was soooo lame though! 3 pieces for $5! It was basically texas toast! After reading reviews from others, I wanted to also mention that they also double charged us for the \"special garlic bread\" with 2 orders when we only ordered 1 and it was over-priced to begin with and dry.\n\nTo top off the night, the waiter had the audacity to ask me if we were using a GROUPON when giving us our check (keep in mind I had to ask for it because of the crappy service)! WTF!?! HAHA I'm not sure if that was a standard inquiry, but I thought it was an interesting question upon payment.

I wore a nice polo shirt and khakis and was worried I'd be grossly underdressed; I was wrong. There were people there in shorts and t-shirts. Many guests were glued to their phones and I noticed a lack of manners. Maybe that sounds prudish, but for these prices I expected more. And I expected the staff to set a higher standard. I understand they want to survive in a competitive market, and I get that it's Vegas, but was pretty disappointed nonetheless. Bottom line: steaks are very good, but atmosphere kinda killed it.

The hostess is warm and attentive, and the bartender Joe, who's been there for a gazillion years, is a classy work of art, never forgets a face, pours a fine drink, and is very welcoming. I confess that I like some of the old time waiters the best, particularly a waiter named Fabian, an Asian guy with impeccable service who's hair would make any girl swoon, be she 30 or 60, but there are some newbies that are impressive as well. These folks go out of their way to make It a special occasion for you.\n\nI miss the piano players that they used to have here, which really set the place apart from anywhere else in Vegas, but it's still a wonderful place. Once Joe pours you a glass of wine or makes you a terrific Manhattan or Martini, you're transported back in time, ready to nestle into the red leather banquettes where Frank and his ilk once sat, and it's always a lovely visit.\n."

After walking past the neighboring seedy bar (the one that had signs saying \"Karaoke With Porn Stars\" plastered on the window), we walked into the Golden Steer. We were immediately welcomed and noticed the bar was bustling. The decor/ambience - dark, wood paneling, cowboy oil paintings, big horns on each wall, red pleather booths, staff in tuxedos - classic or cheesy? I can't decide. In comparison to the polished, popular places on the strip, I'll be nice and say vintage Vegas. \n\nThe lobster bisque was thick, heavy and creamy, and not in a good way. Consistency resembled ... plaster mix. \n\nI ordered the NY Strip. Cooked perfectly. Very good. The hubby's rib eye was a little overcooked. But was ok. We've definitely had better for about the same price range in places like Mortons or Ruths Chris. \n\nOverall, the whole experience was ok. Service was good. Not sure if we would eat here again though, but I'm glad we tried out it out, at least to experience a little \"old Vegas\"."

Just park in front, make sure to put your alarm on and take your valuables.\n\n1.  Ambiance - Inside it is old School Vegas or old School steak house. Dark, booths, tables. While not modern and I would wonder what the place looks like with all the lights on, this place kinda grows on you.\n\n2.  Service - Same as the ambiance.  Old School for sure. Not your modern and gregarious type, but certainly knowledgeable and efficient!\n\n3.  Food - All the steaks are great an I particularly enjoy the Filet and the Rib Eye.  These two cuts of meat here are fantastic, tender, perfectly cooked.  All the sides are great, especially the mushrooms!  \n\n4.  Price - A bit on the expensive side, but most steak places are.\n\n5.  And... you can come here casual, dressed, in a large party or small.  This is a great place and while it may not have the \"it\" factor of other places, Golden Steer is very consistent!"

He mentioned the location wasn't amazing but not to let that deter us. We came in on a Sunday night and were a little skeptical since its in a strip mall but upon entering where promptly greeted. It was late and only 3 other couples were there. The decor was old school. The waiters were dressed elegantly. We had the house cab which was good. We started with the oysters Rockefeller and the flavor was yummy goodness. I had the filet mignon and crab legs and my honey had the 22 ounce bone in rib eye with a side of creamy spinach. The food was phenomenal. We ended the night with some creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e go ahead and pass on that no good. Overall amazing food & service."

The ambiance alone is worth trotting over to what appears to be a hole in the wall restaurant in a rather less appealing part of town. The hubby and I tried it for a dinner out after a show and we were pleasantly surprised by the experience. I absolutely love love love the decor. When you walk in it's like walking back in time to when wood paneling and large leather covered booths were the epitome of class. The dimly lit dining room with the rich dark colors made my head swim at the sight of it (or maybe that was the wine). I imagined what it was like years ago when the Vegas elite frequented it and I don't think they have changed a bit since. \n\nThe service was impeccable. We couldn't have asked for a more attentive waiter. The food was scrumptious. We ordered the shrimp cocktail and oysters Rockefeller, both were divine. The oysters were lush and perfectly seasoned while the shrimp were fresh and cooked to the ideal texture. The bone in ribeye was delectable. I am a ribeye fanatic and I order my steaks rare which makes it easy to tell if a cut of meat isn't up to par. There was plenty of marble in the meat and although the outside wasn't as crispy as I usually like it, the taste was incredible. My husband ordered the filet and enjoyed his as well. The portions were ample and hearty. I relished the evening of divine food and vintage glamour."

It's not like I don't have the time, it's just that the inspiration is gone. Not within The Golden Steer.\n\nI will address the fact that I have been coming to and living in Las Vegas since the early 80s as a child. I have seen 90% (probably more) of the businesses come, flourish and then be gone. There are few places in Las Vegas that offer an AUTHENTIC old steakhouse, and even fewer near the Strip. Everything about this place, ma\u00eetre's d  and all. Other than Bally's, Circus Circus, Smith & Wollensky and Golden Steer, EVERY SINGLE other steakhouse (on the strip) doesn't pre-date 1989.\n\nI have been to ALL OF THEM. They all are 5 star worthy, But S&W can be a bit pricey... Golden Steer is far and away, my champion of Steak AND Service in Las Vegas. It sits in an inauspicious strip mall 1 block west of LVBLVD on Sahara. The best word to describe this place is Incognitus Majorus. It isn't pain-in-the-assedly normal \"In the Rear of the Casino\" Location, see: Circus Circus and Bally's. or tucked away in a location that is too crowded (everywhere downtown). Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Joey Bishop and Marilyn have their own booths. There is a Grand Piano in the front Lounge area. The d\u00e9cor looks as if it hasn't changed since 1957. It is reported that this was one of the frequents of aforementioned characters of yore. What a perfect spot, in close proximity to the Thunderbird, El Rancho and Riviera, and then later, Sahara.\n\nI came to dinner with the most obnoxious accessory to diners and servers alike: A BABY. They not only sat us immediately, but Our Hostess, Stephanie (?) offered a bowl of mashed potatoes before even handing us the menus for food or wine. That was incredible. Haven't seen that before, or since.\n\nIt was my 5th time there overall and first time with my daughters. The prices were on par with every other steakhouse in town, so I don't mind. The food was not only phenomenal, but the service was incredible, and everyone was so polite about my baby girl. The same hostess even offered to hold her while we finished our last bites. The Crab Legs were huge, sweet and buttery. The steaks were cooked to perfection with the right amount of char and smokiness. The service was jaw droppingly amazing and we ended up tipping everyone that helped us. \n\nNot only was this my favorite steakhouse from this point on; but my favorite dining experience in Las Vegas. Hands Down. I hope that someone actually reads this from front to back. I am a local concierge and VIP Host in town, it is my job to report accurate findings out and about in Vegas. I pass over the mediocre and certifiable, I give Kudos to the businesses that inspire me. Golden Steer offered a dining experience that I will remember for the rest of my life. Not only that, they set the curve. I have eaten quite literally around the world, and experienced service at all levels of remuneration, but have NEVER experienced dinner like my 5th visit to Golden Steer."

            "review": "My friend and I went, mostly based on the mythos surrounding Sinatra and his coterie. We both figured it would be decent enough. We called to confirm our reservation and to see if Frank's booth was attainable. The hostess said we had a good shot, but that the evening hostess was different. That excited us, two Italians and Sinatra fans.\nAs the cab pulled up we got worried. Looks like a strip bar in a strip mall, with blaring yellow placards. Upon entry we were greeted by the maitre'd, a hybrid of Alice Cooper and Vangelis, and a hostess who seemed like she thought herself a prosecutor at Nuremberg when we asked for Frank's booth. We let it go, hoping to receive a meal good enough to erase our initial treatment. We followed Igor back to our booth, a red leather wrap around older than either of us. Soon enough our waiter announced himself, in barely intelligible English. We ordered crab cakes to start. I also got the filet mignon, termed here \"the aristocrat of tenderness.\" The crab cakes arrived. Garnished with cocktail sauce and mayo, they had the appearance of breaded urinal cakes. Alas, they likely had worse flavor. First bite impression: undercooked batter. I got no hint of crab. It took immense will power to choke one and a half down.\nThe filet was okay, but came rare, not medium rare as ordered. No sauce, either. Acceptable, but not at $48.\nWe ordered dessert, just hoping that would be good. I asked for bananas Foster. The preparer worked table side, occasionally engaging in feeble attempts at humor. For $15 I got a sliced banana, cheap liquor, and a scoop of generic ice cream.\nWhen it came time to pay, $100 plus per including tip, we found out they don't do separate checks. I guess the POS system is circa 1958. I can accept a shoddy meal. Not at $100. That's terrible. Banking on Old Blue Eye's past patronage is pathetic. If this is what they served the Rat Pack and no one had their knees broken...This could be a cool place. They need to ditch the staff, shoot the cook, remodel the place, and not dishonor the Rat Pack. I am tempted to throw out my Sinatra collection."

You'll likely be in the company of some Old Vegas Money sitting nearby...peering at you curiously. Regardless, its a cool experience with waiters dressed in tuxes and spouting cheesy jokes and factoids for first time diners. The interior is well maintained with classy paintings and red leather upholstered booths that make you feel like you are breaking bread with the rat pack. If you like atmosphere the way I do, you'll feel right at home.\n\nThe bread wasn't bad, but nothing particularly memorable.\nThe steaks arrived at a reasonable time-- we didn't really wait that long. The steak itself was perfect-- definitely one of the ten best steaks I've ever tasted in my lifetime. I'm not sure if it was the best outright, or if it was considerably better than the one I had at Hank's steak and martini. It was a ribeye cooked medium rare--just the way any real steak eater likes em. My girlfriend had the prime rib which came with some pretty tasty horseradish and cream dip. We ordered steak fries as our solitary side. I had no problem finishing my rib eye and sampled some of my girlfriends cut, which was perfectly cooked as well. I can't comment much on the sides, other than to say that the fries we ordered were tasty but hardly better than the fat fries you can get at your local Fatburger. From what I've been told, the sides are good but not stellar at this joint. If i return in the future I'll be better able to assess the experience but from what I saw, it was an enjoyable night with good, expensive food."

The exterior is sketchy, it seems as if you are far from the glamorous Strip, and nearby Circus Circus looms, questioning your decision with its white pillars of 1970's hotel blocks. You walk in and things still don't seem right at the bar. Your barender is distant, demanding; you can't transfer to your table. It seems this is awkward.\n\nHowever, you steel yourself, saying, \"I made the right call. The fancy overpriced places on the Strip have nothing on here, this is Old Vegas, and Frank was right. If they were trading on name alone, the Steer would be gone. I have faith.\" And you would be right.\n\nAs you're led into the main dining room with your date -- or, as with me, my cousin -- you would be wholly validated. The world opens, angels sing, tuxedoed waiters do their thing, and all is right in an onomatopoeic universe where quality is rare and the Steak is too, capital 's' intended. Enjoy it.\n\nDo not question your decision. From the moment you set down in your red vinyl banquette, your waiter treats you as if it is 1958 and the Steer just opened. Charm and discipline exude in equal measure as the oiled wood and red banquettes simultaneously place you on display for all to see and sequester your conversation in privacy unheard of in the modern era. It's a lovely experience.\n\nIf you're an old-school aficionado of the steakhouse as I am, you should convince your partner to order one of the most difficult of \"old cuts\" of steak to find -- Chateaubriand for two. This extra-thick cut of the tenderloin is sliced tableside and accompanied by wonderfully crisp-tender carrots, asparagus, and broccoli with Bearnaise and Hollandaise sauces that put the 50's to shame. The vegetables and sauces were excellent and worth the wait. The steak was out of this world good, perfect doneness and a complete delight. My cousin and I opted to add a twice-baked potato with each of us having half. It was a good decision, but nothing special.\n\nWe skipped dessert as we were quite full but enjoyed our experience immensely. As we were there early in the evening, our waiter guided my cousin around to some of the named tables and pointed out how they used to enjoy their orders and experiences. She and I sat at Oscar Goodman's table, which was fitting for our evening, and enjoyed the history and charm of the staff immensely. I wish more places like this existed in the world; but if they did, they wouldn't be as special, would they?\n\nThank you, and I will certainly be back when in town. Cheers!"

Two of the signs on the doorway - \"PROPER ATTIRE REQUIRED\" & \"RESTROOMS ARE FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY\" are so rarely seen together. However, once you're inside the double entry-way, you have no idea you're on in a rundown plaza on the wrong side of Sahara. There's a very nice looking bar/lounge area immediately at the entrance, and the maitre'd is to the right. We had reservations, just to be safe (I know, it's only Thursday), and were seated immediately. (The Marilyn Monroe booth, if it matters). The decor is nice, no doubt about it, and it pulls off that old steakhouse vibe very well, without feeling phony or pretentious. I was actually quite skeptical on this, but there were no disappointments there. Our waiter, who was a younger guy, and not the old dude everyone talks about, was cordial enough, but definitely didn't do anything amazing. On to the food...\n\nAppetizers:\nToasted Ravioli - As Gordon H told me \"Not gourmet by any means, but I love them.\" And that's what went through my head as I ate them. Good stuff, but you're not gonna confuse it for a fancy dish.\n\nSoup/salad:\nWe skipped. The guy at the booth next to us ordered the Caeser though, and it looked good.\n\nEntree: \n8oz Petit Filet: My guest had this, and she proclaimed it easily better than the bone-in filet at Joe's, but not better than Joe's ribeye. This really surprised me to hear, but I didn't taste it, so I can't confirm/disconfirm. \n\n20oz? Ribeye: Pretty good, but not great.. I didn't get to finish it, so maybe it could've deserved better. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't kick it out of bed, but it doesn't stack up to the competition IMO.\n\nSides:\nTwice-baked potato: Con bacon. My fucking lady friend said that it was good. I think it was too, but I couldn't compare. \nCreamed spinach: Not great. Sweet & too creamy, in both of our opinions. Definitely outdone by Joe's & Del Frisco's here.\nOnion rings: We both saw the onion rings, prominently displayed on the menu, and hoped that they were some extra special dish. They even had an aura emanating from them upon arrival, but ultimately they were just above-average beer-battered rings. \n\nDesert:\nBananas Foster: The fucking business. Flamb\u00e9ed table-side, as it should be. Our man with the frying pan had some liquor ignition issues, so he had to run to the back and start fresh, but the 2nd take went just fine. And the dish was well worth the wait. My FLF said it was definitely amongst the best she's had. I really enjoyed it, but I haven't had enough others to compare. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't rush back here for the steaks. There was a lot of seafood on the menu, which may be excellent for all I know. I will be returning to try the chicken/veal parmigiana, and definitely for deserts. Cool place though, and if I wasn't aware of other places I liked better, I'd probably come here a helluva lot more often."

Freshly made Caesar salad is amazing and you can really taste the quality.  We started with the Seafood Platter and the King crab legs were so fresh and sweet that we didn't even need condiments. I got the filet and lobster combination and that came with a 16oz lobster!  I'm a huge seafood snob, and the lobster was clearly fresh and so succulent.  We ended with the creme Brule, which was pretty typical. Aside from the fresh and high quality seafood, I also loved how iconic the restaurant is.  We sat in Joe DiMaggio's personal booth, which is next to Clint Eastwood's booth and across from Marilyn Monroe's. It was also across the way from the rat pack's booth-- they used to come to the golden steer for drinks and food before their shows.  Very cool!  It was really neat to be in such a historic and iconic restaurant.  If you have the time and the funds, this place is definitely worth the experience. The host Mark and our server Tommy were splendid and ensured that we had a perfect dining experience. I will be returning!"

It let's you peek into the rat pack era, without the fabrication. \n\nThis was my third trip to Golden Steer.  I Started with a Dirty Martini which was very good. As a tradition, I ordered the Oysters on the half, which were fresh but less tasty then previous dinners. The plump shrimp cocktail made up for the oysters. I ordered the bone in ribeye (usually my favorite cut), but also had some of the wifes filet. I would do the filet here. Both were seasoned well. The sides (creamed spinich, wild rice) were just so so. \n\nThe service was excellent, like each visit. I most like this place for the atmosphere, steak and service, but rate it 4 overall.  The strip mall location doesn't fit today's vegas. (to be fair, they cant move it. Its the oldest steakhouse in vegas).  But if you don't want that manufactured, trying to look old school steakhouse, look past the exterior and try it."

My girlfriend had Caesar's Salad (tell them if you don't want anchovy paste in your salad) and I had the French onion soup -- both were excellent.  For dinner, we shared the 16 oz. NY Strip and lobster tail combination with a HUGE baked potato. For dessert, the waiters put a sparkler candle in our tiramisu and sang happy birthday at our table! (We made reservations on opentable.com and indicated a birthday celebration.) All the food was incredibly good and the wait staff was very attentive and friendly!

That is until I took my fianc\u00e9 here for his 30th birthday dinner on 8/14/2015.\n\nFood was okay, had the NY Strip and the ginormous lobster tail and even bigger baked potato. Combo meal came with soup or salad and veggies. Selected asparagus and clam chowder... Blah... (I'm from New England so I'm hard to impress with chowder). Good ,but nothing to rave about for any of the items definitely will not dream of eating anything I ordered. \n\nNow onto my terrible experience.\nWe arrived around 8 pm without reservations, which wasn't an issue, and were seated right away. Great so far. Restaurant was quite empty for a Friday night. Ambiance was lovely, very old Vegas. Nice. Snuck to the \"bathroom\" to set up a birthday surprise for my love. Hostess told me it is complementary and she would hook us up. Still going Great. Now here's were the ship starts to sink. Quickly. Waiter took our order. TWO lobster and steak dinners. TWO steaks ordered differently. Waiter comes out with one soup. Sorry sir we ordered two. No problem, he grabbed another promptly. Ate our \"blazay\" chowder just in time to receive our main course. ONE meal arrived and was placed in front of my fianc\u00e9. Surely mine was next. Nope I was handed an empty plate and utensils. \"I'm sorry sir I ordered one as well\". Blank stare. He left to figure out the problem. The man who placed our order came over and said he thought we were gonna share and he apologizes. (Mind you we ordered a well done steak and a med well steak, don't c how the chef would pull that off). Still no big deal things happen right? He told me it would take only 15 min or so to fire it up. Cool. Birthday boy offered to wait for my food as well. Cold lobster? No enjoy your food babe I'll wait. 20 minutes later no food! 30 minutes later my food arrived. Did I mention the restaurant was not packed? To bad my fianc\u00e9 was full and done with his plate. So we ate two separate meals. By this time im a tad bit annoyed. Oh yea when my food came out they forgot my veggies and my lobster was over freakin cooked and my steak was well done!!! Whatever just bring on the damn cake. While eating I seen others celebrate their birthday with cake being brought out with sparklers and a cheerful hostess singing. Sweet. I wrapped up my plate as I was over it (still hadn't received my veggies, just a plate of meat) . The hostess comes over with an UNLIT slice of cake (there was a candle in it just wasn't lit) wtf? She places the cake down and said let me check on your veggies I'll be right back!!! Are u freakin kidding me? F$&& the veggies lady! Yay surprise happy bday bae . We sat there awkwardly with an unlit cake for 5 min or so until a different waiter came and asked if we needed anything ... Umm yea a birthday celebration would be nice. I told him the hostess ran off and never came back. He giggled and said I can light it. I wasn't amused. He lit the candle and stood there.AKWARD. I sang to him alone. Never again. By this time I was livid. He said I'm sorry about the confusion but I'm sure the food was good? What? Are u kidding me. No manager no compensation no anything. He proceeded to bring me the check with a smack in the face when he charged me 10 bucks for two glasses of water!!! 300 bucks for two dinners ,two waters and a side of disappointment. Thanks for ruining his birthday dinner Golden Steer. \n\nYou get one star simply because my fianc\u00e9s meal was correct and tasted fine."

First off, the staff seemed irritated to be there, including the Bartender and Server. When we first came in we approached the bar and asked if we could sit and have our meal there, the bartender rudely replied that we could but the service would be extremely slow, then walked away.  We sat there for about 15 minutes while she did dishes and prepared 3 drinks before she bothered giving us a menu.  We decided to wait for a table instead. It took 30 minutes before our server came over to take our order.  We watched other tables being sat and orders taken while we sat and watched our server chat it up with the rest of his section. FINALLY I ordered the $40 Filet and a 12$ ceasar salad (it wasn't good at all) that was to be \"prepared table side\".  Someone from the back just came and dropped it off at the table.  I asked later why everyone else that ordered it had it prepared in front of them and I didn't. He said only at tables that order 2 or more salads.  Even though I watched the woman at the table next to mine order 1 salad for her table and get it prepared table side. We were younger than most of the crowd in there, but definitely were there to spend money. Hands down the worst service I've ever had."

Everything was under seasoned, over priced, and no one seemed happy to be there. $300 for a meal I've made better at home (for 2 people btw). They didn't  cook my lobster properly. It was tough and chewy and when I sent it back they proceeded to argue that the middle was raw (not sure if that was supposed to be comforting) even though it was so overcooked on the outside I had to saw at it with a steak knife. They just assumed I wanted another one cooked (although I didn't) and the second one they brought out was barely passable. My cocktail was average and the bread was average. The $12 per person table side Cesar salad was below average and they even served people who were seated after us before us. \n\nThere were no specials and the server was totally unhelpful despite the fact we mentioned we had never dined there and we're excited to finally be able to. They even cleared a plate that I was eating from without asking.\n\nThere was one thing that was good (crab cocktail) and it was the only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star review. I would never recommend this place to anyone. The servers look down on the clientele and they are pretty much absent if you need anything from them."

They are a left over from a different era and can be quite an experience to be in.  I've been in several similar restaurants (and worked in them as well in my youth) so I had a certain expectation to how it should be.\n\nAtmosphere and ambiance was what I expected.  Service is off though.  I'm used to being introduced to the waiter or waiters for my table and the bus boy and asked if I'd been here before (if I wasn't recognized as a regular).  Instead it was very lack of warmth.  We were brought the wrong salads and when we got the right ones, they weren't brought out at the same time.  We also had to flag someone down for water and ice tea refills at least once.  Also, places of this caliber have an intermezzo service, Golden Steer does not.\n\nThe food was ok but not worth the price.  At this type of place I expect to pay high prices but I should be getting phenomenal service and top quality food and prep.  The so called \"world famous ceasar salad\" was not table side prep, was a small plate of a basic ceasar salad - nothing more.  The house salad a friend got was even more disappointing.  It looks like a salad I would get at a casino cafe.  Our tabled had 2 ribeyes and a top sirloin.  My wife commented that her sirlion was a bit overcooked and while good, she had had better.  The 2 ribeyes were cooked right and tasted fine but seemed to lack seasoning and didn't impress me much - for $52 bucks I can go to several other gourmet steak houses and get a superior piece of meat.  Golden steer is still trying to sell people on prime corn-fed beef at prices for what other competing places give for dried aging and grass-fed.\n\nThe power went out while we were there (not their fault).  Staff was vary accommodating because of it and reduced the check for the inconvenience (didn't even have to ask or mention anything).\n\nWe'll probably just skip this place in the future, there are better places where the food and service is better and I can get that fine dining experience."

Anyway, we got there about 5:15 and it was empty except for one other couple. The decor is very nice with big red leather booths and a romantic atmosphere.  The great thing about the booths is that the tables slide out, so any size can fit!!!\n\nOur waiter took our orders, but seemed very quiet and distant. We asked for tea with cream...no cream came. Then we asked to order wine and he started taking our food order before my friend even ordered her drink. Then there was a small spider in my wine. The waiter offered another glass, but I had drank most of this one and all the spiders siblings, so I declined.  He took it off the bill, but still had a distant demeanor. I almost felt like he didn't want us there. I kept telling my friend, you really expect so much better service from an upscale restaurant. \n\nI ordered the massive 22oz rib eye, because that is my fav cut and the only one in the menu.  It was huge, cooked well and flavorful. I knew this would require a Togo box. Then my friend and I decided to share a twice baked potato. This was yummy. It was crispy in the outside and creamy in the middle with bacon yumminess. \nI also ordered the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Warning, these are not typical saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. These were whole and came with a sauce over them instead of the expected slices in butter.  The weren't gross, but I didn't finish them or take then home with my steak. \n\nOk, so when we were getting the check, I heard a very bubbly friendly waiter giving the \"specials\" to his table. Dang, why didn't we get this waiter or were told the specials?!?  I decided to mention it to the manager, because the service was just so disappointing. She told us the waiter had been there for 40 years and was loosing his eyesight and confidence. Now I felt like a jerk. I feel bad for the guy, but I'm torn, because when you order a $52 rib eye, you expect a certain amount of top service to go with it....hmmmm.  What do you think?"

It truly is like a scene out of Casino VERY 60's-70's esque and the service is IMPECCIBLE!  I do not mind paying for a meal when the guests are treated like this and the food is superb and delicious indeed.  A lot of others should take note of this wonderful place!  The ambience if Old Vegas just enchanted me it just envelopes you as you walk in almost like the set of a movie.  I could care less if a celebrity was sitting there (there was and they \"blended in) with the rest if us - EVERYONE was treated the same in this fine establishment.  I can see why they have been in business for so long - good old fashioned EXCELLENT food and IMPECCIBLE service.  I usually order filet mingnon (well done) not an easy task to do but they did it superbly. My steak was rich and juicy AND well done the way I ordered it.  The stuffed potatoe was GIGANTIC and very delicious too! Vegetables were fresh anad crisp and lightly butterred.  The shrimps we had for an appetizer were the size of small lobsters and mouthwatering GOOD!  LOVED then caesar salad and the way it was prepared - right at the table and FRESH and DELICIOUS! You can tell the shrimp and produce were not \"sitting\" in a fridge for a week either!! Beautiful and FRESH along with the rest of the meal.  No its not cheap but its sure not over priced for quality and service either! If you want cheap go to McDonalds and don't \"whine\" about the prices! If you want a meal thats \"out-of-this-world\" go here!  You will be treated like royalty.

A phenomenal experience and I am definitely coming BACK to this favorite restaurant!!  Another nice thing as I frequently travel it was nice to see diners who were dining alone were not ignored for a second - I'd be comfortable coming back here myself - oh its nice to dine with driends but I'd be just fine alone here too!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"

The atmosphere was some what like a old gangster classic joint. I'm really enjoying this. Ordered me a glass of red wine and of course had to try the prime rib if beef: diamond him cut 24oz cooked rare. Not the best prime rib I've had but gotta admit on my top 5 list. I would recommend this experience to anyone. Need more joints like this back home."

Made reservations, no one came to our table for 10 minutes.  $8 steer salad was white iceberg lettuce with sliced carrots and chick peas, 2 pieces of tomato and cucumber all mixed up and placed on a plate....very tacky, diner presentation.  The steak was good but over cooked \"rare\" and the potato was sent back because it had a slice in the skin and 1/4 of the potato was black.  No quality check before serving the meal.  Will not return.  Could have had a better healthier salad from a buffett for 1/8 the price.\n\nThis was on a weekday evening at dinner hour so maybe the weekend crew is better including the salad chef."

The table ordered the bananas foster and the cherries jubilee. The cherries are likely the best dessert I have ever had. And i love good dessert. If you do nothing else, order the caesar salad and finish it off with cherries jubilee. Seriously. It could all end then and you would have lived a full life. Bon apetit"

We got it!\n\nTHE SETTING: Red leather seats, crisp tablecloths, some Sinatra drifting by in the background. Waiters in bowties dressed better than the patrons. DO NOT LET THE CHINTZY FACADE OUTSIDE FOOL YOU - this is serious business.\n\nTHE SERVICE: My father has recently had a stroke, and as such has had to seriously limit his salt intake. This was noted when the reservation was taken, and the hostess took great pains to make sure that everything was setup to accommodate his needs. If we needed water or bread or anything, a waiter was right there to provide it.\n\nTHE FOOD: First and foremost, the tableside caesar HAS to be gotten. Anchovy, raw egg, the genuine article. I do not exaggerate when I say that we ate the salad one slice of Romaine at a time, as each piece had its own unique combination of elemental flavors.\n\n'Elemental' was the watchword for the steaks, as well; simply beef plus time for aging in a controlled environment. Cut like butter, melted in the mouth, crisp on the outside and perfect-rare inside, sitting in a pool of savory juices.\n\nThe salad and steak were so filling we split only a potato on the side, with butter and sour cream. It was good, not great, but hey, it's a potato - it can be done poorly or decently, there is no 'amazing potato'. \n\nThe only slight miss was the creme brulee; the texture was a bit lumpish and it had clearly been kept in the fridge, then quickly blowtorched to melt sugar on top.\n\nThe coffee was excellent.\n\nTHE DRINKS: 2 martinis each, well-prepared, no complaints.\n\nTHE BILL: For four mixed drinks, two salads, two steaks, one potato, two coffees and one creme brulee, $200."

The staff is quick to tell you about all of the famous people that ate there including the infamous Chicago mobster Tony \"The Ant\" Spilatro, but how does that make this pace special?  Ok, if your on a date it is a really nice atmosphere that kind of takes you back to the old days, but the food is a \"let down\"\n\nThe rib-eye is good, but for $40 bucks, my God!  Not worth it!  Trust me when I say Morton's has a much better steak for the money.  However, the appitizers are excellent.  The escargot are done very well along with the oysters, and I must say the desert was fantastic!  The Cherries Jubillee I highly recomend as well as the bannanas foster.  \n\nSo if you plan on stopping by and just getting a few appitizers along with desert with a date, this place is great.  If you plan on stopping by and getting a whole steak meal with the works, you will be dissappointed along with the two hundred dollar bill for two people!"

The gentleman that carved the steak had clearly done this before, and he prepared and plated the food nicely, which was being served with a side of vegetables.  The veggies were also prepared perfectly.\n\nThey have a very nice wine selection, and we were able to find a bottle of zinfandel that went great with our dinner selection.\n\nThe big question you'll have to ask yourself is, is it worth the money?

I haven't been here since the 80s when we came here as tourists.  \n\nA friend and I went here to enjoy a tasty steak, and that's just what we did.  Since we were there early, we had run of the place.  We took photos of the different booths where Sinatra, Elvis, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin dined.  The hostess showed us a side room where she said Tony Spilotro would dine and she had a story about a counter where their guns were placed before they sat down.  When she said that he was there only a month before his body was found in the desert (after he was murdered, he was buried in a field in Indiana), it cast a little doubt on the authenticity of her story.  Enough of that, on to the meal.\n\nWe both ordered the 12 ounce filet that their menu refers to as \"the Aristocrat of Tenderness).  I ordered a chopped green salad with Roquefort dressing.  I got the jumbo baked potato that the menu bills as \"Vegas' biggest.\"  Finally, we each had some chocolate cake for dessert.\n\nThe bread basket was simply some sliced Italian bread--nothing special.  The steaks were wonderful.  Mine was very tender.  I ordered it black and blue and that's almost the way I got it.  It was done a bit more than I prefer.  My friend ordered his well done--he's a Brit--go figure, but he enjoyed his steak, too!\n\nI only got butter with the baked potato and it was swimming in butter.  It was excellent!  My friend got fries which he described as chips as good as you can get in the States and as good as what he gets at home.\n\nWe both ordered the chocolate cake.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  It was a bit dry and a bit small.  There was no dollop of whipped cream to dress it up.  \n\nService was great.  Our server has been with the Golden Steer for years, and he was on top of everything.  Very nice dining experience in a classic Las Vegas steakhouse that has been around for years and years."

The one above our booth had non frosted bulbs and a Crooked shade that lit up half our table. It took almost 10 minutes for someone to come to the table and it was one of the 30 year vets. No hello or welcome just do you want a drink. After he took or order I asked him if he could either unscrew the non frosted bulbs or straighten the shade. He looks up at it and grumbles ''I'm not doing that Move to anyother table\". I've been in service for 30 years too and I've never said that to a customer. He points us to the next booth that had a reserved sign and walks away. We stand by the table not sure what to do until another waiter gestures for us to sit down at the reserved table. Having our drinks thinking ok bad start but better now when the hostess walks up to the table and loudly asks my guest if we reserved the table. I said no but could explain what happened. The old waiter was behind her. She said she new what happened and walked away. WTF then why bother us. Not an apology nothing just walks away. \nOne of the main reasons for going was the table side preparations. We all ordered the Caesar salad. Another one of the 30 year vets rolls up the salad cart but stops two tables away and starts making the salad. I thought it was for a center table until he served it to us. So much for the show. \n\nOur food was eh at best. First the bring the entrees out in the middle of eating our salads and only offered to keep them warm under the lights. The prime rib ordered medium came out part rare, part medium rare and medium. Terribly uneven. The veal Marsala had absolutely no taste of wine and had a red sauce? The veal was tough. Only the chicken Angelo was decent. But hey they did bring out a tiny dry piece of cheese cake with a Roman candle. Too bad they didn't bring forks to share. \n\nLousy service from burned out waiters, overpriced and poorly cooked food. Don't waste your money."

These are but a few of the things that cross my mind when I think back to what has to be one of the worst dining experiences we have had in some time. \n\nHaving heard of the place from my father who had eaten there some time ago and having had a requirement for Prime Rib for my sons birthday, we thought we would give the Golden Steer a try. It was memorably bad, the kind of bad that has the whole table on edge and wanting to leave. Allow me to explain..... \n\nFrom top to bottom the whole experience was terrible. \n\nService: BAD and got worse: . The waiter visited our table EXACTLY 3 times in the 90 minutes we were there. Since the wine list was spotty, I went for a beer. In this day and age it is not unreasonable to ask for the selection since no drink menu was placed on our table. More to the point don't roll your eyes at me either and look put out, how hard is it to say Bud, Bud Light, et al. (Seriously no local craft beers?).  The next and biggest sin in my book was not clearing the table between courses. When you see the appetizer plates, the salad plates sitting at the table, perhaps its time to clear before you try to WEDGE the next course in.  Clear the table BEFORE you ask about desert. \n\nIf the service was bad the food bordered on edible. It was by far some of the worst food I have had in some time. \n\nThe appetizers: \n\nToasted Ravioli: Not only was it clearly a food service product (Sysco perhaps) it was not properly fried so the interior was not completely melted. (Food temp seems to be an issue with this place too) The marinara sauce had a canned quality to it and was pretty much lifeless. \n\nShrimp Cocktail: Shrimp was decent and the cocktail sauce was just okay. I also appreciate the addition of horseradish which helped pump up the cocktail sauce. \n\nBread: First basket was okay, the second clearly was old. I could have taken an at bat against Madison Baumgarner with it. \n\nSalad/Soup\n\nTable-side Ceasar: While they did prepare ours as part of the larger party next to us (and honestly I don't expect the poor guy doing it to make just two for us) it was dull and lifeless lacking much flavor. The croutons tasted like they were from a prior decade. \n\nOnion Soup: The broth was actually okay (more like an Au Jus) but again the issue of properly heating things reared its ugly head. The soup looked like it had been placed under the salamander and was never brought up to a proper temperature. The soup was just warm at service and that made the Swiss cheese clump within minutes into a curd like manner. \n\nMains\n\nPrime Rib: Not a lot to say here but it was clearly NOT slow roasted but rather quick cooked. No seasoning and it was tough and quite chewy. The Jus had no taste either. \n\nNo desert as we were thoroughly disgusted at this point. Its clear that this place is on its last legs and perhaps needs to a featured restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares or Restaurant Impossible.  Either that our closed to put and anybody who is thinking about eating there out of their misery"

The stuffed mushrooms and crab on my steak were bland, the steak was good but undercooked (better than over-cooked), not outstanding...and lets face it, for over $100 pp, it should be outstanding.  The service was stuffy the last two times and it was once FUN! One of the most historical places in Vegas and on the first visit they made me feel as if I just missed an old actor or mobster.  I can get stuffy and overpriced all over over Vegas, so after two so-so tries, I'll probably give another place a shot next time."

            "review": "So I am a big fan of the Rat Pack. No I don't mean Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estavez, Anthony Michael Hall, or Ally Sheedy. I'm talking about Frank, Dean, and Sammy baby. I'm talking about a time when being smooth was what it was all about and the dolls bore names like Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Shirley Maclaine. \n\nI am also a big fan of Vegas and despite it's several facelifts over the years the gold mine in the desert is one of my favorite places on the planet. This is where the magic happened and sometimes still does, especially when I'm rollin the dice and lady luck is kind to me. Unlike many who go for the mega-clubs, rollercoaster's, and the latest Cirque du Soleil act. I go for the nostalgic shows and spots that make Vegas . . . VEGAS BABY!!!\n\nOne such stop is the legendary Golden Steer. This place is where the rats themselves would frequent which automatically makes it a must on my to do list. So after arriving in town Niki and I got ourselves ready and hit the road. Golden Steer is located on W Sahara Avenue just off the strip. Parking is convenient and it may not look like much on the outside but just wait. When you enter it is like you have been time warped to the late 50's-early 60's. The decor has an old school class that is rarely seen anymore but strangely still sheik. The wood plank walls and red leather booths set the scene and one feels transported to a different time almost instantly after being seated. \n\nThe staff is impeccable and informative answering every question and open to offering recommendations without making one feel uninformed. Drinks are a must and something classic is on my mind. I order a whiskey sour and as quickly as I ordered it arrives. It is absolutely perfect and if you like classic cocktails I guarantee that this is the place. When the waiter returned to take our order. To start we ordered the Caesar Salad for two prepared tableside. For our entrees Niki ordered the NY Strip and I the Prime Rib - End Cut with a Jumbo Baked Potato.\n\nIn a few short minutes a table was wheeled over and the salad was prepared. It was a show all by itself and it was clear this fellow has made this many times over the years. Let the eating begin. This is not your usual Caesar Salad by any means. The mix of vegetables makes this a more hearty Caesar but the hints of spice and anchovies is blended perfectly to taste.\n\nAfter we were finished with our salads the entrees and sides arrived. Niki's strip was so tender she could cut it with a fork and my prime rib was equally tender and thick. Both cooked medium rare, juicy, and oh so delicious. This steak ranks up there at the top of my all time favorites.\n\nThe jumbo potato was simply that - jumbo. It was huge and cooked perfectly. It came with chives, sour cream, and butter. The combination as always, spectacular.\n\nNow I know that Golden Steer is known for it's Bananas Foster prepared tableside but I am not that big a fan. So Niki and I order the cheesecake. I know it is a safe option but boy it was good. thick, creamy, with a hint of vanilla. Niki is a big fan of cheesecake and nothing gets between her and a slice especially when the quality is this superb.\n\nSo that's it folks, the shows over. When in Vegas, do what the boys used to do. Enjoy a great meal at Golden Steer and you'll be swingin like Deano himself. Since I got our attention I want to leave you with a quote from the man himself.\n\n\"I feel sorry for people who don't drink. They wake up in the morning and that's the best they're going to feel all day.\"\n\nDean Martin"

I had the bone in ribeye and my wife had the Alaskan crab legs, - that she absolutely loved and my 10 year old son had the salmon - that he said was one of the best that he has had! \n\nFor desert we had tiramisu, which was phenomenal!  \n\nWe randomly got seated in what ended up to be Muhammed Ali's favorite booth to sit in when he visited...

Look no further than this glorious piece of Las Vegas culture and history. From the table-side prepared Caesar salad and the leather booths, everything here yells \"Las Vegas Institution.\" \n\nLooking at the place from outside, may be a tad concerning...There's a ton of construction going on and the area isn't the greatest, plus the vintage bulb-illuminated sign and surrounding shops might give you pause. But don't judge this book by its cover...\n\nWe came here on a Monday night, place was busy but not at all packed. Reserved the Frank Sinatra booth (seats about five comfortably), on the phone they said, \"no guarantees\" but the booth was available and we got immediately seated. (You can also reserve booth's once occupied by Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., John Wayne and a whole host of other pop culture luminaries.) \n\nThis is an old-school dining experience (think Ruth's Chris or Morton's), but not so old school...They've expanded and updated the restaurant in recent years but at the same time have made sure the older part retained its charm - while not making it feel like your Grandfather's den (ok, it feels a little like Grandpa's den, but that's ok).\n\nWe came for both the food and ambience. Both were excellent. \n\nThe meal: Our server was good-ish, not great. We told him we were 1st-timers and relatively informative, considering. We ordered a few different types of steaks - a bone-in rib eye, a filet mignon, salad, and a few sides. Then the server pretty much handed us off to his table buser after taking our order... \n\nMeal overall was great. Steaks were incredible, pricey, but easily the best we've had at any point in Las Vegas - and we've dined at almost every high-end steak restaurant on the strip. But...we were very taken aback by the taste of the creamed corn side. \n\nApparently they prepare the cream corn old-school style, with nutmeg and some other sweeter spices - the server did not mention anything about this when we ordered the side. And there is no mention of the way it's prepared on the menu. We would have sent it back, but as I mentioned the server pretty much disappeared for the last half of our meal (after the food came). Server also did not offer to remove the side from the bill when we asked him it about (after he re-appeared) at the end of the meal and the whole side remained un-eaten.\n\nAside from that, Caesar salad (made table-side) was also the best we'd ever eaten. (We ate at Rao's in Caesar's Palace the following night - we also ordered a Caesar to start there too, but Rao's charged two dollars more for one that wasn't made tableside, wasn't nearly the same size and tasted like it was pre-made.)   \n\nSteer management, your server cost you a 5 star review because of no mention (by him or on menu) about the variation/prep of the creamed corn - thankfully, no one in our party had a food allergy to nutmeg...\n\nWorth the trip, will definitely return again. Won't order the creamed corn."

We loved the charm of the \"Old Vegas\" decor, and it is truly authentic as they've been in business since 1958.  My New York Steak was incredibly flavorful, and it was the meat and the juices you tasted, not a bunch of spice you didn't expect.  Twice baked potatoes tasted like a guilty pleasure and I tried my wife's desert (chocolate creme brulee) and it was out of this world.  I find it hard to believe that you could have a bad experience here unless you're looking for a bad experience, then you'll find it even in the best of places."

Except from the lovely hostess who greeted us with a smile and helped us to our table, the rest of the wait staff didn't have a clue.  I say wait staff, because we never really were clear on who was our server.  It didn't matter who helped us at a given time, they all messed up an order, forgot to get something we had to flag them down to request, or simply ignored the table.  We shouldn't have to call a server over for every phase of the dining experience.  Luckily, we are all patient individuals.\nThe food was great, but it hurts the experience if the entr\u00e9e comes well before any of the sides, as well as no wine (which was specifically ordered to come with the entr\u00e9e) until after the meal is almost complete (trust me, we held out as long as we could to wait for the wine, but there simply wasn't a server that came near us for a solid 10 min). No check-in by anyone after the food came.\nThe icing on the cake was that when the bill came, the server explained that he comped two drinks for having to wait.  That's nice and all, but the experience still suffered, and he also had an attitude as if he was doing us a favor, which frustrated me even more.\nAs Vegas locals, we've been here several times.  The impression that I got is that they are relying on their reputation as an 'old school'  Vegas steakhouse to carry them.  That will work ok with the out-of-towners, but we probably don't have a reason to go any longer."

            "review": "I will NEVER  return to The Golden Steer.  \n \nI am a local resident, and had visited The Golden Steer only one time before, many years ago.  After my first visit I was convinced that I had eaten at one of the finest restaurants in the world.  The food, the ambiance, and the service were impeccable.  Could it be that when Thomas Wolf wrote 'You Can't Go Home Again' he was referring to restaurants, as well?\n \nOn Tuesday evening, December 20, I revisited The Golden Steer with my partner.    The ambiance on my first visit had been that of a Fine Steak House, elegant and tasteful.  On the Tuesday that we visited it was more akin to a Denny's in a depressed area.  Even though the room was nearly empty, we were seated next to a large corner booth occupied by what was obviously a family.  That would not have been a problem, except that shortly after our seating a young girl, about 5 or 6 years old, began singing the one partial verse of Jingle Bells that she knew - over and over.  Again, not so bad - until she started jumping up and down in the seat.  Then a \"Hostess' or some female employee came over to their booth and encouraged the little girl to keep it up, sing louder; and even joined in with her for a few more rounds of the same 8 - 10 words that she knew.  I could have asked to be reseated, but I let it go.  It was the Christmas Season, after all.\n \nMy guest ordered a dinner salad without tomatoes.   They seemed to take forever to arrive.   They finally arrived via table side cart.  They were finished and placed on the table.  There were tomatoes on both salads.  We told the server, and he took the incorrect salad away on the cart.  Nearly 10 minutes later he returned with the salad plate in his hand, and plopped it down, very unceremoniously, in front of my guest.\n \nThe entrees arrived.  I had ordered Prime Rib of Beef (36 oz), baked potato, and creamed corn.  My guest had the Top Sirloin, steak fries and broccoli.  We both asked for our entree to be cooked the same way; medium to medium well.   My prime rib was overcooked - to the point of being DRY.  Fortunately, the au jus was there to make it palatable.\n \nMy partner's steak was closer to cremated.   There wasn't even a tinge of pink to be found in that steak.  We have both had meat that was a little too done on the outside edges, only to have it turn out to be fine as we got closer to the center.  We both kept eating, hoping for a tasty outcome.  Unfortunately, that was not the case that night.  \n \nAfter reaching the center of the dry, tough steak, the waiter finally wandered by.  We pointed out how overcooked the meat was.   He made a production of inspecting every aspect of the half eaten steak, flashlight and all, trying desperately to find even a speck of pink.  Unable to do so, he offered to replace it, although he felt it necessary to point out that nearly half of the meat had already been eaten.  We declined his embarrassingly disingenuous offer.  He left, returning a few minutes later to say that he had spoken to the management who had graciously taken half the price of the steak off of our bill.\n \nNothing was right that night.  The corn was way too sweet.  The baked potato, while big,  was absolutely unfit to serve.  Nearly black on the bottom, it had about one half inch of dark brown, scorched flesh on the inside.  Fortunately, it was large enough that I could salvage some edible parts from the top half.  The broccoli was the opposite, both undercooked (to the point of being hard)  and COLD.  A dab of butter put on top in an attempt to make it palatable,  just sat there, unmelted, throughout the meal.\n \nWe asked to have the remainder of our meals wrapped to go.  I specifically mentioned wanting the au jus for my prime rib, since it was inedible without it.  I was absolutely stunned and actually embarrassed when they brought out our take home package.  Cheap Styrofoam clam-shells in a generic plastic bag!  Even Denny's has more class than to present their guests with such a cheap, inelegant farewell.  When I got home I found that the waiter had forgotten (?) to include the au jus.  My dogs appreciated The Golden Steer.  That night, they ate prime rib for the first time in their lives.\n \nThe prices were very high, on par with what one would expect from a steakhouse that actually serves good food.  The service was poor, and any sign of ambiance must have fled after Sinatra's last visit.  This is NOT \"Old School Vegas\".  This is just an establishment that  'jumped the shark' many years ago."

So many better choices in town that do it much better.\n\nI have been wanting to go here literally for years, as this was my stepfather's favorite steakhouse, who passed away about 6-7 years ago.  A coupon came up on Groupon so my husband and I had a date night, and overall were pretty unenthusiastic about our meal.\n\nHere's the good:\nThe ribeye on the bone is really tasty, and it comes served with au jus that makes it taste even better.  However, there's very very little discernible char, which would have made it incredible.  I also ordered it medium rare, and it came out more on the medium side.  I actually enjoyed the flavor of this steak more than the American waygu at Cut, if you can believe it. \n\nThe service and the atmosphere is also mostly good, but the food came out so fast that we felt rushed to eat and get out.  We literally were back home in almost an hour after sitting down to eat.\n\nCocktails are pretty phenomenal, this might be a good place to do happy hour.  They know how to mix a drink better that I've had in most places.\n\nThe bad:\nThe fillet mignon was tough.  This is supposed to be the most tender meat, but the ribeye came out much more tender than this.  Also, it was ordered by my husband medium rare, but was so rare it was almost inedible in some areas.  Why he didn't send it back was beyond me.\n\nThe french onion soup came out lukewarm and not hot, and the cheese was not melted all the way.  When you took a bite, you could see the entire slice of cheese come up out of the bowl.  I implored him to send it back, but being a dork he ate it.\n\nCaesar salad - they do the table side Caesar service and it was okay, a little overdressed and on the oily side.  There are much better places to get a quality caesar salad for more than half the price.\n\nGarlic bread - supposed to be \"famous,\" which reminded me of the meals I used to have at the Smoke House in Burbank, CA across from Warner Brothers Studios that had the greatest garlic bread ever.  This was prepared somewhat similar, but nowhere nearly as good.  And for $5, they give you a whopping three small pieces of it.\n\n So I would not recommend this steakhouse at all, and recommend instead The Flame at El Cortez, or Vic and Anthony's in the Golden Nugget for more of an old school Vegas steakhouse that is much better in the same price range or lower.  I still have to try Hugo's Cellar, which I'm told is also similar but have not made it out to try it yet."

Welcome to the age of the Rat Pack, where people drank martinis, dressed up for dinner and ordered chateaubriand for two with table-side caesar salad. \n\nLeather banquettes, a staff that are pros at this and atmosphere that just won't quit.\n\nThere were 6 of us.  We walked in, had a cocktail, and were seated.  The hostess (who was great!  I wanted her to join us!) gave us the history of the restaurant and tales of Sammy Davis Jr.  She knows the history of Vegas well!\n\nWe ordered an assortment of steaks (rib eye, new york, filet mignon) and prime rib (the diamond jim cut - HUGE!), caesar salad, creamed spinach, asparagus and potatoes.  We left FULL.  \n\nNote that the meat is cooked tru to temperature - if you say medium but are hoping for medium well... well, order medium well.\n\nWe never felt rushed.  We had a 5-Star experience all the way.\n\nI can't wait to come back!"

The Caesar salad rocked too. So-so on the creamed spinach. It was a little runny and tastes sweeter than I expected. (A little salt went a long way). Not a lot of wine by the glass options. They could improve on this for sure. Only 2-3 red wine glass options. Desserts looked amazing, but I didn't order one. I would go again and order the same salad and steak. I would also order a bottle of wine vs a glass."

We've eaten at many steakhouses in Town in the last 25 years and the quality in the meat served was mediocre at best. When you pay almost $50 for a steak you expect to be able to cut it with a fork.

The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because of the free cheese cake offered as our wedding gift.  The prices are quite extreme for the portions provided.  The salmon was nearly $40 and was barely enough to fill you up with its tiny scoop of plain rice and 4\" long salmon steak.  Service was very poor.  My wife asked for a drink refill and it was never delivered and the staff was rude and stuck-up.  Couldn't even tip low due to a unavoidable 20% tip already included.  Never again."

            "review": "My wife and I dined at the Golden Steer in mid July 2010 with my parents.  I did a lot of online research regarding Vegas restaurants prior to our trip and the solid reviews on Yelp really got my Dad and I excited for this place.  We both love Frank Sinatra, 'old school' vegas, and good steaks.  We figured this place would be PERFECT for us.   It's only about a $15 cab ride from The Mirage as it's located just northwest of the strip. I don't know if we hit it on a bad night or what, but this place was the absolute disappointment of the trip.\n\nWe had a 7pm reservation on a Saturday night and the place was pretty much dead.  There were about 4 people in the bar upfront which had a guy playing the piano who was pretty average.  We were in the 'front' dining room (there was another in back) and it was only us and 2 other couples.  I thought the atmosphere lacked everything the other Yelp reviewers mentioned.  There were hardly any old school pictures of the famous clientele they claimed to have served in the past.  We were in the Frank Sinatra booth and they had a prototypical picture on the wall of the Rat Pack which you could buy for about $5 anywhere.  I didn't see any authentic pictures of anyone dining there in the past and nothing was autographed.  The booths weren't anything all that special - just the old school round leather style with small inconspicuous gold plaque of who's supposed booth it was.\n\nOur group had 1 bottle of wine, soup/salad appetizers, a new york strip steak, 2 petitie fillets, surf and turf (pettite fillet and lobster tail), and a couple of sides consisting of twice baked potatoes and broccoli and the bill came up to $325.  I had no problem dropping a bunch of money on a meal and actually expected to be into it for about $500 at this place - but I thought the prices were an absolute crime for what it was.  The steaks were good but certainly not the best I ever had.  The soup and sides paled in comparison to other high end places I've been such as Mastro's.  I'm absolutely stunned they command the prices they do for how much competition is in Vegas for this price point and how much better it is.  \n\nThe \"schtick\" of the place seemed to be sharing stories about who used to frequent the place, how some of their dishes came to be, and other 'humorous' stories.  All of them really lacked charm and authenticity.  Our waiter was Mexican and the hostess lady made 3 derogatory jokes about him being Mexican.  One of which was telling another table that they needed to say goodbye to him because it was the last they would see of him because Immigration was in the kitchen.  I'm not even kidding you, that actually happened.  Along with 2 other jokes along these lines.  \n\nIt's at this point that I should probably mention that I'm actual not a pretentious person nor do I have excessive dining standards - I'm certainly not a food critic.  However, paying the prices they charge for the quality of their food along with the very underwhelming atmosphere was just a complete disappointment.  I also expect a certain level of professionalism out of the staff at this price point.  \n\nThere are a number of other places my family and I would've rather dine in retrospect and we wouldn't even had to travel off the strip to do it..."

            "review": "This review is for 3.5 stars.\n\nTo begin, I am a fan of strip steak houses.  Yes they are overpriced but they offer that upscale, good-eats environment that almost guarantees a quality meal.  Golden Steer steers in a little different direction by staying true to its Vegas origin.  The scale of the restaurant is less than a strip steak house, however.  Though the waiters are wearing tuxedos and the prices on par, the restaurant itself is located right off Sahara in a unwelcoming shopping plaza; the bar even has machines to play blackjack.  Very Vegassy vibe.\n\nI decided to give Golden Steer a shot because I found a Groupon and was craving a nice dinner.  I ate at the bar and was served a very nice old fashioned for $12.  I then ordered a caesar salad ($12) and a 12oz filet ($48), medium rare.  The caesar salad, though not prepared bar side like I was hoping, was a top notch salad.  Nothing too extraordinary but a top quality salad nonetheless.  The steak came without sides and was cooked all over the place.  The outside was easily medium if not well done.  The inside was perfect, but only about 70% of the steak was cooked correctly, so that was a little lackluster for a top steak house.\n\nIn all, Golden Steer is worth a go only with a coupon.  It's a nice, classy environment and different from on strip places, but I believe you can find a very similar steak (if not better) either downtown or in the suburbs for a cheaper price. albeit not back in time in old Vegas."

I live in the condo building next door so I try to support businesses in my neighborhood. I can honestly say I'll never be a patron at Golden Steer again. \n\nThe first time I came to The restaurant the hostess tried to act like she couldn't seat me despite the restaurant literally being empty. There were literally 3 customers in the restaurant. I brushed it off. The servers were rude to me and practically ignored me and the prime rib was not good at all. I chalked it up to an isolated bad experience. \n\nI came back about 6 months later (today) and the hostess tells me there's a 1.5 hour wait. She later gets on the phone and tells another potential customer that they have space if they come now. \n\nI sat in the bar high tops area for about 25 minutes. Nobody brought me a menu or even acknowledged me. I literally had to go and find a server and place an order. This time I tried the ribeye. I asked for it medium rare +. They gave me a medium-medium well steak. When asked for another steak the server tried to blame it on the au jus. I eat at steakhouses weekly. Au jus had never made a steak more well done in my experience. \n\nAs I type this I've been finished with my dinner for about 20 minutes and no one has come to offer me the check. I'm practically invisible. This is very disappointing. None of the other patrons are being treated like this. I'm the only Black patron in the restaurant. I hope this is merely a coincidence."

It's very dark and romantic as you dine with the oldies playing in the background. \n\nHowever the food is extremely over-priced and very bland. For appetizers, we ordered the Toasted Ravioli with Marinara Sauce $10, which was really good. \n\nFor entree, they are best known for beef, so we order the Chateaubriand Bouquetiere for two with Hollandaise and B\u00e9arnaise Sauce ($55 per person) and we added on Whipped Potatoes $8 on the side. We have never tried Chateaubriand Bouquetiere before and it was boxed out on the menu, looked special and tempting, so we figured we'd give it a try.\n\nThe Chateaubriand Bouquetiere, which is a roasted beef tenderloin, was just ok. The sauces were very bland. For $55, it also came with some steams vegetables on the side (carrots, broccoli and asparagus), which were just plain steams with no seasoning at all. It was not even salted. \n\nOur total (for 2 people)  with 1 drink, 1 appetizer, Chateaubriand Bouquetiere for 2, and 1 side + tax & tip, came to $180.  I don't know if we just order the wrong item from the menu or they were just having an off-day?  But we went there on a Friday night, from 5-6:45 pm. We were the only table there. There was one couple that came in during our dinner, sat down, took a look at the menu, then left. Another coouple came in as we were leaving. But overall, the place was empty on a Friday night!"

Again he interceded with the Have to have the Caesar salad mantra then you don't need 2 potatoes.. UGH if a guy wants to O.D. on starch allow him.  I almost replaced him but he finally got the point. \n\nThe Good: \nShrimp Cocktail, huge cold horseradish on side extra kick up tasty & Fresh 4 were enough for 2 persons $19.00\n\nEscargots de Bourgogne | 16 fresh with sauce just enough to accent them without being overpowered\n\nAlaskan King Crab Cocktail | 16 Hunks of crabmeat with same cocktail sauce that kicked up enough with butter made this a cant miss.\n\nCaesar Salad made table side $11.00 per person was good - not spectacular just good\n\nThe Great\nRib Eye Steak, Bone-in 22oz. | $54.00 4 of these were ordered to a man stated best steak they ever had.\n\nNew York Strip 16oz. | 50$  3 of these 2 absolutely perfect charred with temperature on the button flavor off the charts  1 was sent back overcooked then when returned it looked nuked then grilled quickly it as not consumed. \n\n3 Filet mignon Oscars with crabmeat were all outstanding - \n1 Market price $75.00 Australian lobster tail was simply OK a bit tough\n\nSides: \nAll excellent from the baked potatoes to the creamed spinach to the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and twice baked potato they simply make each dish outstanding. \n\nThe Bad - the Steak being taken back and then returned unable to be consumed was a definite mark off.  Even had to tell them Take it off the bill at the end should have been done without asking.  Service was good after old Joey stopped selling me like a car salesman; it's not our 1st time dining out.  Private room for 12 of us was fantastic and rest of staff was A Plus. \nDefinitely on the repeat list when in Vegas!"

I give it about a 3, my Aunt, who is rather persnickety, loved it, we will settle with the 4.  We went on a Tuesday and the place was just about packed by the time we left.  I knew the inside would be dated.  Their menu describes it as Turn of the Century San Francisco.  Now that I think of it, it does remind me of the back food area at the Golden Gate Casino downtown.  Lots of red and brown going on.\n\nContrary to the other reviews, I thought the table side Caesar was pretty good.  The french onion soup was a little on the cheesy side, but who can really complain about that.  The lobster bisque was also good but of course any lobster bisque could always use a little more lobster in my opinion.\n\nAuntie and I had the crab and fillet, GF just had the fillet.  I had mine cooked medium and it came out just right.  The crab was okay if not a little dry.

Kind of bummer because if only one person in your group orders a salad, they don't do the full service. Instead, they come with the cart, hand you the plate and the dressing on the side in a small bowl instead of mixing and tossing it for you. This is kind of a ripoff because it is still $12 for iceberg, croutons, and salad dressing. \n\nWe ordered the prime rib and the steak and a twice baked potato to share. It was plenty of food and was prepared decent. As we wee finishing up our meals, it then became a never ending  birthday song extravaganza. Every table near us was celebrating a birthday which was a piece of dessert with a flaming firework. I hated to admit it, but it was the day before my husband's birthday. So he experienced the flaming candle thing, which was really quite cool. \n\nAll in all, the service was attentive but a little strange with their interactions, the price was maybe a touch too high, and the clientele mixed (some in shorts/flip flops and some dressed very smartly)."

It was inedible here. IN-E-DI-BLE!!! disgusting just plain horrible, the worst I've ever had, worse than I can even describe, sour, bitter and oily.  Also it was terrible.\n\nThe twice baked potato was... nothing to write about, turly uneventful, really neither good nor bad.\n\nAt least my Bourbon tasted Okay you can't really mess up pouring Bourbon in a glass from a bottle, Oh an the staff was pleasant, I never felt rushed or ignored.

The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce so delicious that I wanted to lick the plate.  It also came with a side of wild rice.  My husband's 18oz prime rib was also good, but so much meat that he couldn't finish it.\nOur friends had the petite and regular filet mignons.  They raved!

I won't dwell on the service, about which many have commented (which I could actually deal with if the food were good).  I'll start with the fact that none of the wine glasses set up at our table looked clean (all had some white-ish film and mine had a little extra something on it).  That's not acceptable at the prices they charge.  The real problem is the food.  We ordered chopped green salads that were something that looked like a 7-year old could make.  The toasted ravioli may daughters ordered looked and tasted like something you can try in the aisles of Costco on Saturday morning.  The quality of our steaks wasn't bad, but they weren't very juicy.  Of the 4 steaks we ordered, only one was cooked to the medium-rare that we asked for.  The others were medium to medium-well.  I ordered steak fries that were actually seasoned well, but were undercooked and looked like slightly higher quality than something you'd find in an elementary school lunch.  We ordered bananas foster (table-side service) for dessert.  it was kind of a fun process watching it flame up.  Taste-wise, it was just a sugar-bomb with only half a banana in it.  I'll sum up with 3 notes.\n\n1.  I went here on the recommendation of my best friend, who is a certified foodie.  However, my wife reminded me after our beyond-disappointing-for-the-price meal that my friend is Hindu and generally doesn't eat beef (so maybe he doesn't know it when beef isn't great?).\n\n2.  My wife said the best dish was the broccoli (which was a single steamed, unseasoned crown).  To be fair, my wife really liked her apple-tini.\n\n3.  My daughters' comment after dinner:  \"The water was nice and cold.\"\n\nIf people like the historical significance of this place, maybe it should be converted into a museum."

For it supposedly being 22 oz it barely filled the plate. You can get the same cut at Austin's Steakhouse in the Texas, have it be bigger, with a free sauce, and all for 10 bucks cheaper. I asked for it to be medium and it was cooked perfectly. It was also very juicy. It didn't have a lot of flavor though.\n\nI originally wanted to order the onion rings on the menu, but the waiter let me know they were frozen and come from a box, so I just settled on the fries.The fries I got were non-crisp, starchy, non-seasoned, too thick potato spears. No salt or flavored oil or butter coating them. I had to send the over-baked, no-flavor garlic bread away. They didn't want to make the tableside caesar salad fresh at first until I asked them to. When they did make it tableside, it ended up being the most flavorful thing of my meal. The bananas fosters I got was decent, it didn't have a real good sauce though, it tasted mostly of orange. It wasn't bad, but you think of rum, brown sugar, and banana when it comes to bananas foster, not orange.\n\nThe staff was nice and accommodating. They amptly took the bread off my bill when I said I didn't like it. Another waiter quickly made sure I got my tableside salad. My drink always stayed filled and I was always checked up on.\n\nThis place seems to be living through it's glory days instead of keeping their menu up to date and competitive. For the quality of food, they are seriously over charging. Unless they put up another groupon, I won't be coming here again."

Away from the noise, hype, and over-priced cuisine of the strip, this classic 60s steakhouse has the d\u00e9cor, staff, menu, and presentation of a bygone era without being kitschy or fake.  It is completely authentic, from dark woods and red velvet chairs, to the western paintings and decor, to the low lighting and knowledgeable, friendly waiters in full tuxedos.  We enjoyed every second of it.\n\nWe intentionally ordered items prepared tableside, first Caesar salad and later Bananas Foster, so that we could be part of the experience and chat with the waiter.  He complimented our attire and my vintage necklace, saying it reminded him of a time when people knew how to  dress appropriately for dinner.  It made me smile, because that was exactly the experience we sought.  The wine list was classic and had plenty of great selections to accompany the menu.  The salad was flavorful and plentiful.  We chose escargot and Clams Casino as appetizers.  Both were delicious.  We did not soak up the escargot juices with the bread, but thinking back, I wish we had!\n\nOur entrees were the 12oz filet and the T-bone with whipped potatoes and mushrooms as accompaniments.  I read one review that said the mushrooms were in a strange sauce, but I don't know where they got their taste buds.  They were perfectly saut\u00e9ed in butter and garlic and full of flavor.  Had we not been in polite company, I am confident that my boyfriend would have chewed off what little meat remained on the bone when he finished!  \n\nFor dessert, he had the chocolate cake, I had the Bananas Foster.  The preparation and end result were mouth watering!  The chocolate cake was good, nice and fudgy, but paled in comparison to the Bananas Foster.  Knowing that my boyfriend would inevitably steal some of mine, our waiter made us an extra large portion, so I could share.  \n\nI agree with the reviewer who noted that much of the charm and classic menu selections are lost on diners not old enough to remember the 60s.  If you want a 21st century experience, stay on the strip, but for those of us who were born in the 70s, but want to dine where Elvis, Frank, Dean, and Sammy dined, the Golden Steer hits the jackpot!"

You feel like you are entering the 60's version of Las Vegas. Pretty classy. I was greeted by a beautiful hostess who led me straight to my table. From there it seemed like I had two waiters for some reason checking up on me. It was kind of weird.\n\nI end up ordering the Caesar Salad, Stuffed Seafood Mushrooms, and the Bone in Ribeye Steak.\n\nCaesar Salad: (5/5) The salad was tossed right at the table with all the classic ingredients. The salad itself was amazing, probably the best caesar salad i've had. You could taste the subtlety of the anchovy. The croutons were also crisp, by airy. \n\nStuffed Seafood Mushrooms: (2/5) I really did not like this appetizer. Usually I don't regret my orders, but this one was a big time meh. While the mushroom was cooked fine, the seafood stuffing was bland, lacked texture, and just tasted whatever. I had to force myself to finish it. Honestly, my friend makes a better version of stuffed mushrooms. \n\nBone in Ribeye Steak: (4/5) The steak came out on a sizzling plate and looked like ready to beast on. The first couple bites were out of this world. It was perfectly marbled. I was ready to give the trophy as the best steak to this one. But as I beasted on the edges of the steak, the interior got a tad bit tough and was not marbled. As I got closer to the bone, the marbling came back, and I was happy again."

Ask for the room in the rear, as the lighting is a little lower and the wood paneling a little richer.  We had the Shecky Green booth at the far back and I will remember to ask for it again.  Our waiter, Fabian, was just right, no hovering or \"I'll be your server today\" prattle, but always just a little way off when we needed him.\n\nAnd the steaks were fabulous.  My rib eye covered the whole plate. Succulent and marbled with just a little fat, cooked exactly medium rare and let to rest just long enough for the juices to stay inside.  My friend's medium well filet mignon was to his liking as well.  He started with crab cakes, light and flaky and my crab cocktail was the kind that brings you back to Vegas.  My wife's oysters on the half shell were fresh and sweet, though the horseradish sauce lacked punch.\n\nMy only gripe is that the wine list is just adequate, not great.  Fabian looked at the Barolo we brought to remedy the problem skeptically, but it was big and still tannic and a great match to the meat and corkage of $20 wasn't outrageous.  Can't wait to go back with our next out of town guests."

As usual, everything from appetizers to dessert were wonderful.  \n\nIf you haven't tried this place, take the time to make a reservation and stop by.

The place conjures up everything that 'old Vegas' inspires in the minds of anyone of a certain age who is old enough to appreciate the Rat Pack era, but young enough to still be able to stay up as late as Sinatra did back in the day. Red leather banquettes, gold chandeliers, dim lighting, servers dressed at least as well as the patrons...it's all there. We were seated at Betty Grable's booth and promptly greeted by a somewhat aloof server. Our wine and calamari appetizer arrived quickly and we summoned our steaks and sides soon thereafter. We had ordered the signature tableside Caesar salad, but it was unfortunately forgotten. Once our steaks arrived we reminded our server of the forgotten salad and he halfheartedly acknowledged his gaffe. The hostess then arrived and told us that the salad would be compliments of the house. All appreciated. The steaks and salad were very good and prepared precisely as ordered, but once the bill arrived the salad was included. We reminded the hostess of the error and she quickly took care of it. (I wish she was waiting our table that night) Our server returned for the check, but without much to say other than the minimal niceties. All in all we definitely enjoyed our meal, but I have a feeling another server would have taken it to another level. I'd definitely visit again, but perhaps only when our particular server was enjoying a somewhat-deserved night off."

A lot of the wait staff have been here for a long time and are just not working here until they finish school or make it in acting or something.

We were a large group, and the restaurant claimed it was \"no problem\". I'm sure we were all aware that we were going to be hit with an automatic 'large group' gratuity fee, and we were totally willing and able to pay it. While ordering, I inquired of our server (T#m) if it was possible to get \"separate bills\". He said that it would \"all be divided at the end\". OK. So we order. Some people's meals were much more expensive than others. The food was stellar. End of the meal, and the bill comes. One big bill. For everybody. When T#m was asked why our bills were not separated we were told: \"We don't do that here\". Which is BS, as I'd had it done before. We proceeded to spend about ONE HOUR trying to figure out who was supposed to pay for what. It COMPLETELY KILLED the good meal we had just consumed. In retrospect I believe he was just worried that we were trying to snake our way out of paying the automatic 'large group' gratuity. I normally over-tip as it is, but on this occasion I think I was sure to pay not a penny over what was required - purely out of spite. Oh yeah, he also uttered this gem: \"This isn't Denny's\". Huh, well Denny's has it all over the Golden Steer, as they automatically separate your bills! I don't think the Maitre D' was too impressed with T#m either, as he was openly mocking him whilst serving the appetizers. \n It was doubly embarrassing for me personally as I had a couple of first-timers with me along for the experience. They were APPALLED at what occurred. Not a good experience, and a pricey one too!\n I'd consider going again if I knew that T#m didn't work there anymore."

Every staff member we encountered was excellent. First though is that we ordered (and ate) too much. We started with two excellent crab cakes. Then the table side caesar salad which was perfectly balanced - lemon, garlic, anchovy, etc. My wife had the filet Oscar (which she loved) and I had the bone-in ribeye (which was the best steak I have ever had). Dry aged, prime beef cooked perfectly (rare). It was absolutely delicious! For sides, we had the twice baked potato and the creamed spinach. The potato was good, but the least good of everything. I thought the spinach was excellent, my wife wasn't crazy about it. They use a touch of nutmeg (which I love and is probably what turned my wife off). I would definitely go back and highly recommend it to anyone that loves a great steak. We wouldn't have known about this classic had it not been for Groupon.

            "review": "Anyone following my reviews knows how much I like good service, grand surprises and interesting anything.  The Golden Steer meets all of my criteria in such a huge way that there won't be enough room for me to sing its praises.  The strip can be so repetitive and boring.  Let's face it, sometimes over stimulation can become mundane.  The brain becomes numbed with flashing lights, bustier clad waitresses and $50 tiny bites decorated with balsamic squiggles.  Surprise me.  Take me to the Steer.\n\nWalking in initially you'll say to yourself:  \"...What the Hell have I done?\"  (the place looks like a ranch house meets steak joint meets speakeasy - it's very old and in no way resembles the black lacquer, track-lit Wolfgang Emeril place you ate last night).  However,  if you keep an open mind, suspend your strip-sanitized expectations and really get in to it, you'll have the time of your life here.  For God's sake, people - dress up for the occasion.  Pay the proper respect to one of the last standing restaurants of old Vegas.  If it was good enough for Frank, Ava and Sammy to dress up for, it's good enough for you.  \n\nThe staff fawns over the well heeled.  They,  themselves in tuxedos, bend over backward to make certain that you are comfortable, that you have what you need; they make recommendations, they give compliments, they prepare old school Caesar salad table side. The water & wine glasses are never empty.  It 's like being in an old black and white movie - they are just THAT courteous.  \n\nThe food? It's not cheap, folks.  However, food is expensive in Vegas.  At the Steer, you'll be rewarded with huge, quality portions.  I am picky when it comes to red meat.  Very picky.  I like it so rare it might just be considered raw.  Few places ever get it right.  The Steer was right on the money.  My prime rib was seasoned beautifully, cooked perfectly, presented on dishes that probably have not been updated for 20+ years (to this last part I say, 'hooray'!  I'm so weary of the super slick scene in Vegas). My whipped potatoes were rich, creamy and delicious.  Don't miss the Caesar salad mentioned earlier.  They still use the raw egg and you can't beat the texture or the flavor of this authentic method.  My companion's NY steak was, again, a perfect medium-rare.  He commented that it was the best he'd had in recent memory.  Since the two of us eat out, literally, all over the U.S., Europe and central Mexico that's saying something.  I can't speak to the dessert tray as we were too stuffed for anything but coffee.  We sampled the coffee with seven liquors.  We made the mistake of ordering two and here comes my only criticism:  they are SO strong that they taste like gasoline smells.  Coupled with the bottle of wine we had, it was too much booze for one fabulous night.  I'd skip this staff recommended beverage and just have a standard cup.\n\nWhen it was time to bid farewell, jump quickly back into a cab (the Steer isn't in the greatest area of town - be advised), and head back to the masses we were actually a little sad.  Everything back on the strip seemed too bright, too phony somehow.  How an old joint sporting a plaster cow outside can be glamorous is beyond me, but it is.  Eating at the Steer you'll feel like you've not only had a meal, but an adventure.  You'll also  feel a little smug having had the moxie to actually leave the strip to dine where American legends have knocked back a few together."

They claim it's been the best since the 1950s, and they live up to the expectations. For a stand alone steak, with no fancy butters or seasonings, I recommend the golden steer. It is a great place for a date night, or close friends in an intimate environment. For dessert I reccommend the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e...it's chocolate!"

The first time we came here we were mislead by a guidebook saying this place was tacky and not great but was frequented by the likes of Elvis, John Wayne, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr and on and on. We pictured a diner that served diner type flat top fried steaks. When we walked in with t-shirts and jeans only to be greeted by a man in a tuxedo we knew we couldn't have been more wrong. They treated us great, so great we didn't even care the bill was over $200 for just the 2 of us. This was like stepping back into classy pre-strip Vegas, maybe that's why people aren't impressed......."

The service at best was mediocre, the setting and ambiance was nice. I ordered a coke which was flat,  a garden salad that was drenched in ranch, a filet mignon medium rare that was tasty and cooked to perfection, creamed spinach that was so soupy and runny it was disgusting, whipped potatoes that tasted like box potatoes, the \"famous\" garlic bread was burned and tasted like there wasn't even a hint of garlic on it, for dessert cherries jubilee that ended up like a soupy mess..the bill was $246.67 of course before tip. I have had much better service and food at other steakhouses.. I should've stuck with Anthony's at the M. They never do me wrong."

Went to the Golden Steer steakhouse with a close friend, We are both born and raised in Las Vegas and remember coming to this restaurant many many years ago. It was one of the few fancy steakhouses back in the day. Wanted to enjoy a nice meal in a old school higher end not OUTBACK steakhouse since it had been forever and thought we may get much better quality and service then one of the chains we go to all the time Morton's, Del Frisco's  Flemings etc.....looking forward to their table side caesar salad since not too many places offer that these days. The captain or waiter not sure of his title was polite enough but not very engaging. A little too aloof for that job only my opinion The salad was decent not the best table side Caesar but okay. We both ordered the shrimp scampi which was good. Shrimp were decent size and the scampi sauce was delicious!  The service was not so great or the caliber you would expect from a restaurant that markets itself a certain way along with the prices it charges. We had to request additional water along with bread several times. They kept forgetting, and it wasn't busy at all. That in itself doesn't turn me off from coming back or recommending a restaurant, everyone has an off night, but what does and why I am writing this is the way the bill was presented. The Captain/waiter brought over a portable credit card reader swiped my card and then stood there and pointed out the tip choices. He got his 20% which would be the norm that I tip but it was out of the pressure of him standing over us. While he would have received a tip, the service wasn't very attentive it was mediocre at best my feeling 15% tip would have been fair.  I have never ever been presented a bill in this manner and would never expect this at a so called higher end steak house. For that I will never patronize nor recommend this establishment to anyone. Management really needs to revisit this practice. It screams very low class"

We got the ribeye which took up the whole plate you gotta have an appetite to finish the whole thing. Then the lobster and filet mignon was to die for, I love my steak a little pink on the inside and they cooked it perfect. Lobster tail was huge I couldn't even finish it all. The twiced baked potatoe was filling it's enough for 4 people, the mushrooms were so good I wasn't a fan of the asparagus it didn't have too much flavor. We got a bottle of wine which topped off the whole meal I definitely would recommend trying this place it's pricey but we'll worth it."

The decor is definitely what you'd expect from a \"steak and martinis\" type of establishment.  However, it's located in a run-down strip mall and we found the dining room virtually empty at 9:00 on a Thursday night.  This gave the place feel more like a seedy airport lounge than somewhere I would have found Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin.\n\nAs for the food, the pride that this restaurant has in its steaks is not misplaced.  The beef is really good, if overpriced.  The 14 oz. New York Strip that I had was a whopping $40.  Even the chicken entrees were $27-28.  I know it's expensive to eat in Vegas; but this seemed excessive.  Mind you, this is coming from someone who dines out regularly in San Francisco.  Anyway, the beef was the only thing that impressed.  The salad looked like it was from a bag and the sides of mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were nothing short of baby food.  The mixed seafood platter that we started with was stocked with king crab that was still frozen and cocktail sauce that could have come from Red Lobster.\n\nThe service was very attentive and our server was quite personable.  He even comped a couple of desserts when he found out we had some birthdays at the table.\n\nIf you're a carnivore with a fat wallet and little love for ambiance, then this place is for you.  As for me, I don't think I'll be coming back the next time I'm in Vegas."

I thought my stomach would explode from the size of that sucker! I got it medium rare and it was perfect, I will dream of that steak for years and years to come. Everyone else at my table got something different, wife got the veal parmigiana while my sister and her husband both got steaks, but we all agreed at the high quality.

The interesting part was that, the street walker was an old man and he was wearing pink leotard and pink tutu.  I can't be certain but I think he also had a pink bow on his head. The whole incident took about 7 minutes and we couldn't stop staring!  When the lovely \"couple\" drove away, we decided it was safe to get out of our car and walked towards the restaurant.\n\nFrom the outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much but inside, it was really nice.  I'm a sucker for ambiance and I really liked the old school and classy d\u00e9cor.  All the servers were dressed in formal uniform and they were very attentive.\n\nTo start with, we shared a bowl of Lobster Bisque.  It wasn't bad but it tasted slightly different from all other lobster bisque I've had before.  It was smooth and creamy but on the heavier side and somehow it tasted a little tart (kind of like sour cream). \n\nFor entr\u00e9e, BF had Petite Filet Mignon and I had Lil Cut Prime Rib.  We both ordered medium and both meat came out perfect.  The Prime Rib was HUGE and it was delicious especially with the freshly grated horseradish.  As for the Filet Mignon, BF said he's had tastier piece for much less at other restaurants. I believe him; the man always gets Filet Mignon at any restaurant that has one on menu.  \n\nOverall, I'd rate this place 3.5 stars.  I enjoyed the Prime Rib but the Lobster Bisque, not so much.  Also, we saw two of their staff hanging out and taking cigarette break in front of the restaurant - one before dinner and another after dinner.  I didn't expect that for this type of restaurant."

There are a million cookie cutter steakhouses on Las Vegas Blvd., but there's only one Golden Steer.\n\n\n**There is one more thing I would like to add.  If there is something you do not like during your visit to the Golden Steer, try to bring it up to the management.  The staff at the Golden Steer take a lot of pride in what they do, but it's very difficult to change or correct an issue if they do not know something is wrong.

The food is great and I really like the menu but the service is so terrible it ruins the entire experience.  They have a team service approach where any of the waiters can wait on you, but instead of the service being excellent they are just trying to push you out the door and you do not receive attentive service at all.  When I am paying $200 for dinner I expect the food to be excellent and the service to be professional.  The last time that we went there after we had been seated for about 15 minutes and a busser had brought us water a waiter came up to our table smacking gum, leaned on the table, clicked his pen and said \"are you ready to order?\"  WHAT!!!!!  This is something that I would expect at a Denny's not at a high end steak house.  I was actually mad that the waiter was so abrupt and I thought the gum chewing was DISGUSTING.  \n\nWe explained that we were not ready to order quite yet and he just turned and walked away.  A couple minutes later another waiter comes up and says \"are you ready to order?  There was no introduction, didn't ask us if we had been there before and did not discuss the menu at all.  We finally ordered and another waiter brought our food out.  There was an issue with how the steak was cooked but we had to sit there waiting trying to catch a waiter's attention.  After sitting there for about 10 minutes not eating a waiter finally came over and asked if everything was OK (a different waiter).  We explained that there was an issue and he took the steak back.  \n\nI am actually sorry that the service is so bad because I like the restaurant, but when waiters are unprofessional and discourteous it ruins the experience for me.  The prices are commensurate with high-end steak houses on the strip but the service is not."

Because this is an older Las Vegas establishment, they are grandfathered in and one of the only places that are allowed to have an open flame to make their signature desserts.  I must say that my first bananas foster experience did NOT disappoint.  The one caveat is that they could not split up our check, however they do take multiple forms of payment.

The food was good overall but I don't need to be disrespected and insulted on top of mediocre service when I'm dropping a grand in your establishment.\n\nWe had a group of 8 get together for a post Viva Las Vegas dinner. Please note that while this is a rockabilly convention we all dressed up to the nines for a \"classy\" dinner experience at the Golden Steer. When we arrived we asked to have separate checks because as with many high end steakhouses, the items are served ala carte. Thus, it makes figuring the bill at the end a nightmare with this many people. The excuse was the computer system can't handle it..and apparently writing it down on paper is too hard as well for the 200 dollar tip. Our group was not loud nor over demanding yet had a lot of trouble getting service in general as others have mentioned in reviews recently. \n\nAs expected, the chaos begins when it comes check time. We get handed one copy of the check and are basically told \"you need to figure it out\". After lots of asking we finally got multiple copies to try and make sense of the confusing bill. This whole process takes us 40 minutes of struggling with the staff to clarify the bill as if it just too much trouble for them despite the place being less than half full. We ended up missing a show in Vegas we wanted to attend dealing with this fiasco.\n\nAs we start paying, the real fun begins. We are told by one of the servers in a very condescending and rude tone \"well, maybe they do that at Denny's but we dont do it here\" in regards to the poor service with the check. It seemed to be a personal shot based on being from the convention. Also, when asked why we are not being taken care of as is a servers job.. He replies \"is it my job?\" as if he would be doing as little as possible for the 20 percent tip. The older waiter over hearing the conversation was clearly embarrassed by his colleagues remarks.\n\nSorry but there are too many other great steak houses in Vegas to deal with lazy and insulting staff. Perhaps he should not have been so judgmental. I work for a Fortune 100 company and like to take clients to dinner. I make a good living and I am highly educated, I dont eat at Denny's thanks.  I don't need this garbage. Guess who isn't taking any clients here anymore?\n\nP.S. Denny's probably has a spot on their overnight staff for your rude server. He obviously can't handle this gig."

I was fortunate enough to be invited to a dinner party here by a friend's boss, who reserved a room and treated close to 20 people to an amazing meal.  had I come on my own, my experience may not have been so amazing, but this was awesome.   \n\nFirst, I felt like I'd gone back in time when I entered, then the staff was all dressed formally and the bartenders looked like they had been here since Sinatra was last here.\n\nOur meal was a whirlwind of deliciousness.  We were started with a platter of cold seafood: lobster, crab, oysters, and shrimp with the appropriate accompaniments. There was yummy bread and butter, then our meals came.  Several at my table had prime rib, there were a few different steaks and a friend at another table went all out with the lobster!  We also had sides of mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms.  I had ordered a baked potato and it was seriously one of the biggest potatoes I've ever seen!  Everything I ate was delicious.\n\nWe had beverages on our own dime and I have to say the whiskey sour was PERFECT.  We were definitely too full for desserts, but overall, we felt super spoiled, especially since all we paid for was our drinks!\n\nThe place was clean and cool looking.  You really feel like your in old Vegas  \n\nThe ONLY reason why I didn't go for a full 5 stars is that our main waiter was a little odd - kind of brusque and then he jacked up our drink bill and was kind of snotty about it.  But otherwise, LOVE LOVE LOVED the experience!\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED, but keep in mind, it's PRICEY!"

Among the best pieces of steak I have ever had, in such a beautiful setting. What a find!!\n\nCaesars salad made fresh, from scratch (including the dressing) right in front of you. Do not leave without ordering one. Best Caesar salad ever.\n\nOutstanding service. Polite, kind, diligent, and enthusiastic waiters in tuxedos who LOVE their jobs. Our waiter had been there some 20+ years I think, and many of the others looked like they had seniority. He was so passionate about the restaurant, the owners and the food. I love that!\n\nLOVELY ambiance. Oh how deceiving the outside is. The restaurant is off the strip in a strip mall with no windows. I was scared to walk in. Walked in , and loved it. Old hollywood indeed. And tuxed out waiters to top it off.  \n \nFinally the food. Porterhouse was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Amazing. Juicy. Perfect. Generous portion... Great for sharing.\n\nNothing more you can ask for. And with the groupon, the price was even great. Although with everything they offer, I'd go back in a heart beat, and pay full price... If I lived in Vegas :("

No sooner were we seated that we were asked what we wanted to drink and what we wanted to order. I had to explain we were in no hurry to order dinner, wanted a drink first. While waiting for our one drink and bottle of wine, two more servers appeared to ask for our order.  Finally we gave in, not even 1/2 way through our drinks. Caesar salad still served tableside, server overdid the oil so all you tasted was oil. Ordered the filet, medium rare, was served to me raw+, sent it back and within seconds (no time whatsoever) to cook was served to me again and yep, raw, couldn't even cut it with a knife. Seriously? The best steakhouse in Las Vegas...not anymore. Decided not to chance a 3rd time. The baked potato was a baked potato. The b\u00e9arnaise that was served with the first filet, sat there and got cold while someone in the kitchen attempted to cook the filet to medium rare.  The veal parmesan was adequate. Nothing special so much sauce you couldn't see the veal. They did remove the filet from our check and offered dessert but by that time we were so aggravated we paid our bill and left. Nothing like it used to be with the exception of the restaurant itself. Lastly, they need to get some servers who speak English. Don't bother, go to CUT inside the Palazzo."

The food was actually really good for the most part. We ordered the escargot and Caesar salad for the table to start. Escargot was nice, but I can't say much for the Caesar salad. It was prepared table side, which is nice, but too much dressing and too garlicy for me. I am a big fan of Caesar salad and this didn't really do it for me. \nNow this is where the experience took a turn. We told our server that we had a Groupon and it's like his entire attitude changed after that. He became short and never came by. We ordered an 18oz Prime Rib and a chicken dish. This took over an hour and I always order my prime rib RARE. The few times we were actually able to flag our server down during this hour, he said he had another table that he had to help prior to us, and he said this several times. We finally told him I had to go to work, which I did, and been there about an hour and a half at this point. Food came out, Prime Rib was ok. Not the best I've had. The angel chicken and mushroom dish was awesome. We also got creamed spinach and it was just way too rich. Overall the food was fine like I said. \nSo after we were done eating our server comes and gives us our check. He could of asked if we wanted desert or maybe bring one on the house since I waited over an hour for a rare Prime Rib? Naw, he doesn't roll like that. He said, said we told him we needed to leave is there anything else? I was thinking desert, but he just made me feel like I was wrong for saying anything in the first place. He then brought a little credit card machine, pointed to the gratuity part and made sure to point out the original total before the groupon discount..again like he wasn't getting a proper tip, which was his attitude towards the whole thing from the beginning. It was like beyond obvious. \nSo if people ever read my reviews I rarely go off on service like this or ever really. But this guy single handedly ruined our experience. So after all that I am still giving 3 stars, because of the food and the atmosphere. I just don't think will be back."

The prices were comparable to other high end steak restaurants. Drink orders were fill promptly but food orders took a little more time than expect for the amount of diners that were in the restaurant.  The server (his name was Jay) seemed pretentious and to have a classist attitude. I don't know if it was because we were the youngest ones in the place or not.  The waiters attitude wasn't bad enough to give this place a 3 star rating until we got our bill.  Our bill came (didn't have the our gratuity added to it yet) and it seemed right so I paid with a gift card.  When I got the charge slip back it showed my remaining balance on my gift card to be lower that it should have been.  I called my gift card to see how much was charged and it was $30 OVER what was printed on the charge slip.  We called the waiter over the inquire why my gift card was overcharged.  He said that the tip was already included in the bill.  I told him that he had no idea what we were going to tip and that gratuity was not automatically included with only a party of two.  He then got the manager who ran the card with my tip (which was 20% of the bill - $29.13) and said that it ran without a problem.  No apology given by the waiter or the manager was given.  This seemed highly dubious to me.  The pre-tip charge slip must have been printed and voided out and then reran for the higher amount.  It felt like the waiter was trying to guarantee himself a 20% tip without our knowledge.  The way the waiter and manager handled it felt like this fraudulent activity is a very common occurrence at this establishment.  My advice to anyone frequenting this establishment is to thoroughly inspect your bill and to pay CASH only.  It was an unfortunate event that ruined and otherwise pleasant dining experience."

One of our group mentioned that we must have pissed off the waiter.  Steaks, tough! Feel free to check out my other reviews. I am never negative about restaurants, but this one took the cake.

My gf used to go here a lot when she was in college and always talked about it, how awesome it used to be to get a serious steak dinner in an old school steakhouse with charisma and old school charm. Johnny the original bartender is still there, been told he's been there for 50+ years. (I bet he has some stories)\n\nBeing from the Midwest and raising cattle my parents love a good steak. And my cousin and her husband are cowboys(girls) from Red River NM and they love a nice piece of meat as well.  This was perfect, they were all staying at the Flamingo Hilton (behind the flamingo tower) and I swung by to pick them up.  Being so close to the strip it's an easy trek up LV Blvd from flamingo.  We walked in and were immediately greeted and escorted to a table in the middle of the room, we wouldn't all fit in the few booths available. The place was remarkably quiet for the amount of people in there, a huge group of Texans with cowboy hats occupied a table of about 12 in the middle of the room but they kept it down even though there were about 4 bottles of wine empty on the table already haha.\n\nI ordered the Ribeye and it was out of this world. Such a big piece of meat!!!! Ribeye is my favorite cut of steak, the marbling is perfect in this cut and it holds a flavor really well. Some cuts of steak that you try to season never really hold a marinade but ribeyes do. I had the baked potato and it was huge as well, I didn't finish it all.\n\nMy whole family still talks about their experience at \"that steakhouse\" in Vegas talking about how big and reasonably prices the food is. And they're from the Midwest where prices are about 60% of Vegas standards for the same quality and size of steaks so that's saying something.  \nWill definitely be back someday. Still waiting for a steakhouse to do better than this in this town, however there have been a few that are close to comparable. \nOverall experience was 5 stars, Can't wait for my parents to come back so we can go again (since they paid (: )"

Initially indifferent, I must admit there was a certain feeling of cool sitting in the booth where Ol' Blue Eyes used to sit. We debated whether there was enough room in the booth for the entire Pack. I argued there was only room enough for Frank and up to 2 broads. This was confirmed when we noticed similar booths tagged with the names of Dean Martin and the rest.\n\nThe dark, classy back-room ambiance is definitely a throwback to a gone-by era of guys and dolls, gangster and dames. Just ask one of the waiters for a story from the old days...Though most of the staff is younger, there is  a guy who looks like he time-traveled from 1960 to make  you a table-side Caesar salad--which, by the way, is just what he does when you order one.\n\nSteak was uniformly excellent. Even though I'd already eaten dinner and didn't order food, my friends were nice enough to offer me cuts of their meat. The New York Strip, which was mistakenly delivered to my friend who ordered filet mignon but did not mind, was juicy even at medium.\n\nThey also make a mean Old Fashioned, about the only thing on the menu that I actually ordered for myself.\n\nOn the way out, my friend confused two Canadian businessmen in town for CES for waitstaff, thanking them for a wonderful night. Oops, but the verdict was right.\n\nPS: You already know this, but make sure your wallet is stuffed with Grants and Benjamins and your credit card is loaded before venturing in."

We only saw our waiter to greet us, take our order, and ask us for dessert.\n\nWe order the \"famous\" garlic bread to start. It was extremely \"crumby\" and pretty tasteless. \n\nEach of us ordered some kind of steak or prime rib. The meat was okay. Nothing to write home about. We also ordered the \"world's largest baked potato\". Again, nothing special here. One of our other sides was saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.

From there, we had appetizers, more drinks, and our entrees.  After ordering beer and blood marys, we had oysters rockefeller, clams casino, veal marsala, twice baked potatoes, lyonnaise potatoes, toasted raviolis (which were a bonus as we didn't order them), and creamed corn.  I swear I could have stayed for 2 days!  I mentioned that I had a Groupon and not an eyelash was batted.  They retrieved it from my phone and we moved on without missing a beat.  Every single staff member was impeccably dressed, courteous, and accommodating.  I really did feel like I was \"Rat Pack\" worthy, all the way down the music being played.  We finished dinner and still managed to have enough leftovers to fill a bag. (We don't eat a lot but like to try a lot of different things.)  After paying the check and leaving the restaurant, we were called back by a staff member.  It seems Groupon automatically adds the gratuity and I had added another on top.  I find it refreshing and ethical that they would hurry out to find us to let me alter the total.  We have definitely added a new \"regular\" place to vist on every trip. I can't believe I didn't know about them before, but believe you me, I'll never forget them!!  Next time I'm asking for Sheckie Greene's table so my butt can sit in the same grooves as his!"

Looked for a steak house and thought why not, let's give Golden Steer a try, lots of history and old...like me. I'm actually older by a couple years\nInside was old fashion d\u00e9cor of years past, very inviting and a nice ambiance. Waiters and servers were very friendly. \nOrdered the combo New York and Lobster dinner. The lobster was fantastic, the steak was just a bit overcooked from what I ordered, wanted medium rare, got medium. My waiter was more than happy to get me a new one but, I struggle with throwing a good piece of meat away. It was only a little overcooked and I thanked him for the offer.\nOne of the most incredible taste is the table side made Caesar salad. They make the dressing right in front of you, super fresh and OMG flavor. Best ever. The French onion soup is very good as well.\nSo when I start eating my dinner, things take a turn. They make an incredible Bananas Foster table side. And a few tables away was one being made. To start with they light a firework sparkler thing, like a fountain. Really nice for show but, it filled the entire room with a horrible sulfur smelling smoke. I mean it lingered for 10 minutes plus. Completely ruined my experience eating my meal. My nostrils and my taste buds where ruined for the night. From what I hear, on a busy night there could be 40 of these things going off during your meal. So sorry to give a not too impressive review but for the money, you didn't match my expectations."

Bartender (forgot his name but Hispanic guy) scooped ice w the glass and then packed the ice in with his bare palm. Gross!!!..call the Health Dept!!  Bartending 101..use an ice scoop and don't handle money and paperwork and then touch ice or rim of glass w your nasty bare hand. Barf!!! \n\nShortly after we went to be seated in dining room and specifically asked to transfer tab. Same bartender said they don't do that and they are separate and we had to close out. 2 of us are locals and work in restaurants and know that is a greedy scam and a lie. Obviously he wanted the tip instead of transferring for one tab like any high class restaurant offers to do. Then he hands the credit card machine to the one paying and asked him to press the button equivalent to the percent tip he wanted to leave.  Bartender didn't bother telling him grat was already included for our party of 9. So embarrassing seeing someone so hard up for a tip scheming for money. Nobody goes there and wants to scam you out of a tip when they have no problem paying $60 for a steak so relax.   Go be a cabbie you sheisty hack..and wash your hands! \n\nOysters and apps were good. Table side caesar was nothing great. We only wanted 8, but they made 9, took the extra one away, and charged us for 9 anyway. Guess this is a tourist trap where they figure no one looks at the bill that goes on the company card anyway and that's how they make a few extra bucks that probably really adds up. 3 of us got steak Oscar (2 ordered medium rare and one medium) but all 3 filets were dry.  Tsk tsk. The guy that got the pasta enjoyed his dish though :-/.\n\nThink it's just a place you go for the history and nostalgia.  The rest is out w old Vegas standards and in with the new cookie cutter garbage."

At this price point, my food experiences have been memorable and worthy of wish listing a revisit.  Golden Steer doesn't make the cut.  \n\nAs for the decor, in a city of themes, this does not stand out.  I believe there is a way to honor the \"old school\" history and stay updated with lighting, menu, and decor.  \n\nShould you decide to try for yourself, I'll advise not to \"fall\" for the upsell of caesar salad.  Just because it's made tableside it is not special.  For $12 each person I feel ripped off.  \n\nIf you order steamed asparagus, request sauce otherwise it is too naked.  Anyone can steam asparagus, I'd like something I cannot accomplish at home.  I did not find that here.\n\nThe rib-eye is $54 bone in.  There was perhaps 6-8oz of meat, the rest was grizzle and fat.  Total weight from the menu, 22 oz.  Go for the filet of 12 oz for $48.  \n\nThe crab cakes had little filler, but were wimpy/limpy pan fried, I think.  The cocktail sauce was actually pretty good, but this gets a mediocre rating as well.  We could not discuss this during tasting due to the Mr. Caesar Salad at our table tossing and making a show of the salad.\n\nSo there you have it.  I could have given 3 stars had I paid $75, but the bill was $160, plus tip.  I'll go elsewhere."

For an entree, I got the bone in rib-eye, which was honestly one of the juiciest and delicious steaks to which I've ever indulged myself.  This accompanied with a twice baked potato was the perfect classic meat and potatoes meal.  My only regret was not being able to finish everything and get dessert.  Next time!\n\nIf you are looking for a great spot for a classic meal or an anniversary or birthday dinner and happen to be in Vegas.  Give this spot a shot, you won't regret it!"

The temperature on the steak was perfect.  However, there was not a lick of salt or pepper on either the vegetables or the meat.  I don't just mean that it was underseasoned, either... it literally tasted like a steak for someone who isn't allowed to consume added salt.  I'm not sure how can you leave cooked asparagus or broccoli unsalted?!\n\nThe dish did come with bernaise and hollandaise, and I presume that this was meant as the seasoning agent... but even still, the steak and veggies should have been seasoned.\n\nThe food was a massive letdown.

From the staff, the food, and last but not least, the old school Vegas feel and look, the Golden Steer is a night out that will not disappoint. Please do yourself a favor and order the table side presentation caesar salad. The best caesar I have ever had. Had the filet and it is outstanding. The baked potatoes are the largest, and best, I have ever seen. And to top it off, the bananas foster table side presentation is the best way to top this fabulous dinner off.  The staff, Alfredo especially, are among the best in the city. Even Fabian, who has been serving there for 40 years, is a treat to interact with. We were lucky enough to sit in Elvis Presley's booth he sat in when he frequented GS. Of course if you would like to sit in Dean's booth, Franks table, or Sammy's as well, all are represented. The GS is worth the cab ride from any resort you may be staying at while in Vegas. It is an original icon and separates itself from the celebrity chef themed steak houses of the strip. Whether your celebrating a special event or are just wanting a great steak in an original, one of a kind environment, the Golden Steer will not disappoint."

I thought maybe it was a bar or something in a little strip mall.\nIt ended up being a steak restaurant in an old strip mall.  It had some good reviews so I thought I would give it a try.\n\nI was amazed when I walked in the door.  It was gorgeous inside.  Stained glass windows, nice upholstery, the lighting was good.  A hostess/waitress came over and welcomed us.  We said we were just looking and they said go ahead, walk around.\n\nWe decided to come back and eat here.  The 2nd visit was just as friendly.  We were seated at a beautiful booth.  The Hostess told us the history of the establishment.  The mobsters used to meet in the back where they had a special back door so they could get out fast if the cops arrived and in the 60's when Sammy Davis Jr could not stay in the hotels on the strip that he played at nor eat in their restaurants, he and his friends would come and eat there.   They still have his original booth with the same upholstery.  Very cool.  I love hearing the history about places.\n\nWe ordered the Caesars Salad, Steak, Prime Rib, and Asparagus.\nCaesers Salad was made fresh at our table and was incredible.  I would come here just for the salad.\nBoth the steak and the Prime Rib were cooked exactly to our liking.  My husband likes Medium well and I like Black in Blue (rare&cold on the inside and just browned on the outside).\n\nThe asparagus was perfect.  Crisp, but cooked with a light sauce that was equally delicious.\nI will come here again.\n\nWe also saw the next table over having a birthday.  Their dessert came with sparklers and singing. :)"

Sat down got a quick rundown on specials, ordering was fairly fast, service was spotty for the price of their food. Multiple people bringing you the order. Food was subpar for the price you pay. This place is living on it's past of the 60's and 70's. Nothing wowed us from the stuff we ordered, servings were small for the price. Would not come back here. Lots of other similarly priced places in Vegas with better service and quality of food. To the owners those that don't adjust get left with the times and this place is 20 years behind in quality and service."

This place is something out of the 1950's that's appears not to have changed in years.  There's pictures of John Wayne and other's from that era on the walls.  You come here for a steak or some prime rib and the typical side dishes. \n\nWe shared the bone end rib eye that was about 22 ounces and plenty to share between two people.  Got a bottle of wine and started off with some Oysters Rockefeller.  It was a simple dinner, but we were pretty full and didn't have the side dishes.\n\nIf you want to get off the strip and you're into old school steak houses, this is a good place to go and get away from the strip (about $20 taxi) and go back in time."

My wife and I ate at the Golden Steer on 5/16/13 (Her review is before the Golden Steer plant's review below mine.), and the food was simply horrible. For starters, we sat at the Marilyn Monroe table. Yes, the place has been open for a while, but they do stress the old star-power a bit much, making one wonder of the quality of the food. You'll see why I say this: \n\nWhen the bread and butter was brought out, we were eating it and noticed a really strange flavor. I tasted the butter on its own, and it tasted as if it had sat in the fridge for a very - very long time before being brought to our table. Sure we wanted to sit in Marilyn's booth, but we did not want to eat the same butter that was served to her!!! Right then and there I wanted to get out as fast as possible. Nevertheless, we decided to overlook this, notify the waiter, and give them another chance. He didn't bring out any more bread and butter, hence the bad butter must've been all they had. NOTE: Steak is often cooked with butter....\n\nThe ceasar salad came out and it was prepared at the table. We passed on the raw egg, which I feel is a wise move after reading previous reviews alleging salmonella. Barring that, the salad was edible. \n\nI ordered the ribeye medium rare, and my wife ordered the porterhouse steak. Mine actually was tasty, though bloody and borderline raw. My wife's porterhouse, on the other hand, was a different story. She told me her steak tasted a bit off, similar to liver. I took a taste. To me it tasted like pee! I spit the bite into my napkin.   The waiter attempted damage control by bringing her a slab of prime rib. She didn't like it. I tasted it, and it was bland, unsalted, and I have had better at $15 buffets - time and time again. \n\nI really wish I didn't have to write such a scathing review, but this place is priced like an exclusive fine-dining establishment, yet prepares food like as if to act in direct defiance of the health dept. We will not be returning."

It's in a little shopping plaza so the parking is kind of small. But once your in there, it's surprisingly very nice. It's kinda dark in there, it reminds me of what I would think old skool Vegas would be. It was a little expensive but what do you expect for a steak house in Vegas. I ordered Prime Rib diamond Jim cut that sucker was huge. It looked really intimidating when it came out. I ordered it medium-well wow it was delicious. I would really recommend this. Just keep in mind that all side dishes are not included. I ordered the twice baked potato it was OK but I thought it would of tasted better, it was a little plain. My husband ordered the bone-in Rib Eye steak, this was delicious it was nice n tender and super juicy for being well done. He also ordered the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms OMG if you love mushrooms you have to order these.. They we soooo good I don't know know what else to say, they were buttery garlicky just yummy. Along with the jumbo baked potato. All I can say about that was WoW. It was huge, it came with all the goodies. All n all I recommend this place if your  carnavor like us. It's a really nice restaurant great for date night or to try something new"

The bar needs to be fixed up--it is the first place you see when you walk in and it looks aged (and not in the good way),  Once you get into the steak house proper, then it is classic Rat Pack vinyl booths, with memoribilia and photos from famous people who used to frequent the steak house.  We sat at the Mario Andretti booth!\n\nSERVICE:  4.5 stars.  We were met by a super nice hostess and seated immediately (we did have a reservation--which I highly recommend).  The server and his support staff were very good and attentive--and certainly knew the menu in and out.  \n\nDRINKS:  3 stars.  A steak house should have perfect cocktails--ie martinis, cosmos, etc--ours were served promptly but the Golden Steer seems to use fairly pedestrian liquor in their well.\n\nFOOD:  4.5 stars.  We started with the best Caesar Salad we had ever had--made table side by a very skilled server.  We had the Ribeye, which was good sized, cooked perfectly, and very flavorful.  We also had the Lobster Tail--which was prepared perfectly as well.  Our sides were the Twice-Baked potatoes--which were amazing and I highly recommend them--and the Creamed Spinach--which was quite good as well.  The desert was the best part--Bananas Foster made table side--the bananas were lightly coated with the carmelized alcohol, and they were amazing!  Unfortunately the ice cream it was served atop of had ice crystals which kind of took away from the overall effect.\n\nVALUE:  This place is not inexpensive--but it is nowhere near where some of the super fancy places on or just off of the strip.  \n\nOVERALL:  4 stars.  I think the service and food are quite good--but the bar is an issue that should be fixed."

The twice baked potato, fresh asparagus and mushrooms were good, but nothing exciting...but that steak...YUMMY! \nJust when we thought they had topped themselves we ordered the bananas foster...and again...WOW! Excellent presentation and the the flavor was an excellent blend of bananas, ice cream and a hint of citrus.\nThis place is a definite must! Come hungry, but don't come broke.

We had been planning to dine there for awhile and by chance I happened to get a Living Social certificate for $50 for Golden Steer so everything seemed perfect. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that we were not welcome and our business was neither wanted, nor needed. I would mention the name of our rude, terrible, gum chewing (I KNOW!) server, but he never bothered to give it to us. Nor did he give us a wine list until I asked for one. The server had nothing but contempt for us from the moment we presented our Living Social voucher. (If restaurants have a problem with taking these vouchers, then they shouldn't offer them, in my opinion). I guess he figured we were cheap kids and he wouldn't get a good tip. That really doesn't account for the lackluster service and presentation overall. The food was okay, not great, not bad. My filet mignon did have a piece of gristle in it - which is unaccaptable for a $45 filet, but at least it was cooked properly. The same could not be said of my Husband's ribeye. Honestly, what they did to that poor piece of meat was criminal. It was nearly burned to a crisp (ordered medium rare). Overall, the food sucks, the service sucks, and the ambiance is depressing.

The old-school Vegas vibe totally got her into the vacation spirit, and the food was pretty good, but unfortunately the service marred our evening.\n\nOrdered the escargot appetizer ($16) - they were okay, it wasn't the best version I've had, and server did not replenish the bread so that we could enjoy the herbs and oil. Maybe we should have had the seafood-stuffed mushroom caps our server recommended.\nWe had the Caesar salad for the table, prepared tableside ($12/pp) - was disappointed that no anchovies were used in the preparation considering the price, but I liked the croutons. Found it odd that the salad guy did not make eye contact, speak to us, or engage with us at all? Awkward.\nWe waited an hour for our entrees- the Chicken of the Angels (egg battered chicken with artichokes and mushrooms), was incredible, tender and moist without being too heavy. The prime rib (rare as requested, with both fresh horseradish and horseradish cream) was decent, but the creamed spinach  was wayyy too rich.\n\nOur server was absent for the majority of our visit, and was condescending when he was around. He asked for our order twice within 5 minutes of being seated, then copped an attitude when we asked where our food was after an hour of waiting. We let him know we had plans and he was rude about it instead of apologetic. His attitude was completely unnecessary and just made the experience even worse. After we wolfed down our entrees, he took his time coming back and getting our check- I had planned to order dessert, but he took so long that it wasn't an option. \n\nThen, he stood over my shoulder and pointed at the gratuity chart and stared me down as I entered his tip! Completely uncalled for, unprofessional, and disrespectful. Bringing the portable card reader to the table is a tacky move in the first place but there's a way to handle it professionally, and this wasn't it.

I had a little sticker shock when I realized martini was $18 (including tip.) sometimes I forget about strip prices...it was an excellent martini though, extra dirty as requested.\n\nWe ordered basic dinner salads, a side of asparagus, a side of twice baked potatoes, I got a  petite filet and my husband got the 12 oz filet. \n\nWe received our salads promptly and noticed a few minutes later that two very loafed carts were going to the dining room beside the one we were in. Even at 8:30, the place was very busy. I was feeling pretty relaxed from my (strong) martini, and didn't even notice how long we had waited for our food to come out until Lynn stopped by to apologize for our wait, and let us know that dessert would be on the house (which was super nice, but I had been hoping for honey toast somewhere else...) \n\nThe asparagus was perfectly cooked, the twice baked potatoes were okay, last time we had creamed spinach and I would have preferred it over the potatoes. Our steaks were glorious. I should preface this by getting a little cocky, and saying that I can grill a perfect filet mignon...I like medium rare with a gorgeous crust, and I've got it down pat. For this reason, I usually don't order filet when I am out to dinner...but theirs is *almost* as good as mine. I buy my filet at Costco for $38 for 3 steaks vs $42 for 1, so I have to take that into count... :-p \n\nFor dessert we went with their chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e that tastes exactly like my granny's homemade pudding, and the chocolate cake, which is one of the best cakes I've ever had at a steakhouse. \n\n\nWe had a $60 groupon, and dessert was on the house, so our bill came out to around $72. Considering I had purchased the groupon with a local deal coupon for like $20, that wasn't bad. \n\nStaff is friendly and you get the fun old-Vegas ambiance, with the free entertainment of drunken bachelor parties, and middle aged men on golf trips. If you live in Las Vegas you should experience it at least once. Check for Groupons before you go."

We made reservations in advance and requested for Frank Sinatra's booth (Table 22) as we were walked to the table the hostess told us this was the best seat in the house.  Sinatra's booth was across from Dean Martin's booth and Sammy Davis Jr's.  Our dining experience started as soon as we walked through the door, from the host stand to sitting in our booth and all throughout the meal.  \n\nWe started with cocktails: a dirty martini for me and 3 fingers of Jack with an ice cube for him.  The servers work as a team so there were several people coming around checking on us, complimenting on my boyfriends cocktail (Sinatra's drink of choice).  \n\nNow on to the food, we ordered the cocktail shrimp appetizer, ribeye med rare with a side of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms for me and NY strip med rare with a loaded baked potato for him.  While waiting for our appetizers, the dining room was filled with other diners ordering table side Caesar salads or cherries jubilee for dessert.  There was so much to watch in the small dining room of about 9 or 10 booths, whisking of Caesar Salad dressing from scratch, flamb\u00e9ing of cherries, birthday sparklers going off around us, and this was all before we even got our food.  Our shrimp cocktail didn't have any bells or whistles when served, but it didn't need to, the size alone was ridiculous!  The shrimp cocktail comes with 4 huge pieces of shrimp, cocktail sauce, lemon wedges and small bottle of Tabasco.  When the entrees arrived, our steaks were cooked a perfect temperature of med rare and the serving size again, made for a hungry man.  Lucky for me, I don't believe in taking a good steak home for leftovers so I did some work.  The sides were good accompaniments but the steaks were the main star.  \n\nFor dessert we decided on the Bananas Foster made table side.  You can definitely taste the ingredients added in front of you with hints of orange and nutmeg.  We ordered the Golden Steer Coffee to go with desert, the server forgot about this but as soon as we mentioned it, he immediately apologized and said, \"No, you have to get it, completely my fault, it's on me\"  as we were finishing up our dessert and coffee, the maitre d came by and asked us if we needed any assistance with a cab which I thought was a nice service touch.  \n\nAfter 4 drinks, appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 sides and dessert, bill came out to a little over $200 not including tip, not bad for the service and food.  Definitely recommend for the experience and a great steak."

Off the strip and standing since 1958, this Vegas institution has served Frank and the Rat Pack, Marilyn, Ali, Joe DiMaggio, Vegas mobsters and the King himself. \n\nWe arrived dressed to the nines, him in his wedding suit and me in a white dress and fur. We were seated in a corner booth done in red tufted leather with a plaque that said \"Betty Grable.\" Betty Grable was a World War II pinup star and actress who frequented the Golden Steer with her husband, band leader and trumpeter Harry James. Apparently they rarely spoke to each other on those visits - hopefully that doesn't jinx me and my husband lol!  \n\nOur server was of the typical old time steakhouse variety - a bit gruff but accommodating. We ordered a nice bottle of Shiraz, Caesar salad for two, two filet mignons and some creamed spinach. The tableside preparation of the Caesar salad takes you back in time and tastes pretty darn delicious. The filet mignons were superb (though I should've taken the ladylike route and ordered the petite filet which would have been plenty filling at 8 oz, but my eyes are always hungrier than my stomach!). We were planning on ordering one of those spectacular flamb\u00e9 desserts but the Golden Steer had other plans for us. The waiters came over with a slice of cake lit with a sparkler singing \"Happy wedding to you\", which was just the sweetest (cake was delicious, too!). It was definitely the perfect way to celebrate our special day, and we would love to come back someday to celebrate our anniversary and look back on the wonderful time we had! (Hopefully we'll have a large enough party to snag the King's booth next time )"

A Vegas original.\n\nFor those complaining about the service, you've gotta understand where you are.  You don't trot your significant other or your family into Golden Steer on a Friday night and expect rush service.  If you do expect that, then go to Black Angus.  This isn't 'dinner,' it's an event.  Soak it in.  Chill for a couple hours.  Actually chew your food.  Order dessert.  Extend the evening.

Sure beats a ruined evening while you quietly bitch about an overcooked steak and tell your fellow diner(s) how you can't wait to get on Yelp and destroy them.\n\nSmile once in a while.

We brag it up about the great food, the great service, and the unique \"old Vegas\" charm.  However, this last weekend, I experienced something different than ALL the other times I have been there. There are reviews on here that suggest that it is slowly going downhill, and I would have to strongly agree. \nWe were there on a Saturday night and the place was half full. I have never seen that before. The server that waited on us seemed to be going through the motions. Completely uninspired.  The server who made the Caesar salad at the table(one of my favorite parts of the meal), was also totally uninspired and not interested at all in answering the questions our guests had about the process of making the salad. We seemed to be bothering him. We ordered a bottle of the Cakebread Cab ($140), and it came to the table warm.  At the prices they charge, and for a bottle of wine at that price point, it is pretty poor service to bring it to the table warm.  When I informed the server of the fact that it was warm, he asked me \"what would you like me to do\".  I didn't say it, but I thought to myself, \"solve the problem!\"  Instead, we asked him to chill the wine. We shouldn't have to tell the server how to handle a warm bottle of wine.  AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, why are they serving a nice bottle of wine warm?   Where are they keeping it?  Either way, not the kind of service you expect at a restaurant that charges a premium price. Outback, maybe....but not the Golden Steer.\nThat being said, the food was very good.  Not as good as usual, but good. No complaints about the food.\nWhen we finished, the place was a ghost town.  No hostess around to ask to call a cab. \nNo one to thank us for stopping by.  Something has changed with this place.  Employees are uninspired. They are not busy on a Saturday night.  They are not taking care of the customers like they used to. No longer would I consider this a \"special\" place to go, and no longer certainly worth the extra time and effort to go off the strip."

I absolutely adore places like this, it was away from the strip, the mood was intimate and felt classy. The decor reflected its classic history. However, the food was just not up to par. My siblings and I ordered the seafood platter, Manhattan Clam Chower, a filet mignon, and 2 prime ribs (an 18 and 24 oz). Seafood platter was quite the disappointment, clam chowder was aight, prime ribs were cooked to the correct texture, BUUTTT it was under seasoned. Ordered the 3 steak sauces, all three were quite underwhelming. Food wasn't gross that's why I didn't give it a 1, but it was overpriced for the quality of the food. \n\nSo in short, if it weren't for Frank Sinatra and the lovely environment, this place wouldn't have people flocking to it. This place doesn't need to be the best steakhouse, but it does need major step up in the quality of their food if they wanna stick around.    \n\nIf my migraine impaired any judgement, it was giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt, cause I was in denial of how underwhelmed I was."

The steak should have been replaced with a fresh one, not reheated and dried out! Two people, 2 steaks, 2 baked potatoes, 1 shrimp cocktail and one escargot=$300.00! Definitely NOT worth the money."

Unfortunately we only found some good sides, pictures of past celebrities, and poor customer service.\n\nWhen we first arrived and were walking up to the front door we were not greeted by a valet or door man, but by a transient who was going through the butts in the ashtray next to the front door. When checking in at the host stand I mentioned that we had a reservation, and was told to pick any table since few tables were in use. I suggested that the host check the reservation two more times, hoping that he would see the special occasion notes that were made with it, The host did not check the reservation and I was never able to covertly mention the special occasion throughout the evening.\n\nAfter selecting a table our drink orders were taken by the host. A short time later a waiter came to the table who spoke with a thick accent and was somewhat difficult to understand. He seemed to indicate that our drinks probably were not being made and said he would check on them. When the drinks did arrive, the waiter commented that it was a good thing he checked because they were not being made, then asked if we were ready to order. Waiter never introduced himself or explained anything about the restaurant or menu. We placed our orders of rib eye (medium rare) and fillet mignon (medium) with a table side Caesar, side salad, creamed corn, and twice baked potato.\n\nSalads came to table and a busser/expediter tried to remove them from he table while we were still holding forks and eating. Explained to him that we were not done yet, but would definitely set our forks down on the plate when we were. Same young man came back about four minutes later and tried to take the salads again!\n\nThe entree's were brought by someone other than the server. The cooked medium was fine, but the medium rare was over cooked. When the server was flagged down by us (never came by on his own) we advised of the issue. The server looked at the cut and excused himself to get a woman who appeared to be the manager. We explained again that the piece was over cooked, and the server interrupted the conversation with the manager to insist that we cut further into the center of the steak in hopes that the exact center of the steak might be to our liking. The manager admonished the server a little, and said obviously the steak was over cooked and had a new one ordered.\n\nWhen the replacement cut arrived it was under cooked and almost slimy. My partner was frustrated as my meal was almost completed at this time, and when asked if they should fire it up again we declined because my meal was nearly completed and mentioned to them that the cooks at a \"fine\" steak house should be able to get their cuts cooked correctly since that is their specialty.\n\nWe left feeling quite disappointed in our attempt to visit \"Old Vegas\" hospitality and dining, and have told friends both in LV and going to visit to skip this steak shop."

After doing a bit of research and reading a fair share of reviews, I was a cautiously optimistic about what the evening may hold.\n\nI have to say that, for the most part, this was a fine experience and I will certainly be back!\n\nOrdered-\n\n- Caesar salad ($12)\n- Whipped potatoes ($9)\n- Rib Eye Steak, Bone-in (22 oz.) ($54)\n- bread basket (complimentary)\n\n(+) Ambiance and Decor are absolutely incredible! When setting up the reservation, I had requested the Frank Sinatra booth, if possible. Even though we were just a party of 2, they were able to accommodate my request! Usually, it is reserved for parties of 3-4 I was told. This was greatly appreciated! I was geeking out at the thought of dining in the same space where the 'Chairman of the Board' would dine as well! So. Freaking. Cool! The  bar area looked really sharp too! I can't wait to come back and enjoy some drinks here!\n(+) Service was off the charts outstanding! Everyone was attentive to our needs and checked in on us to make sure everything was good! Fantastic service all around!\n(+) The steaks were so tender and juicy and full of flavor! It's right up there as one of the best steaks I have ever had! (see pics)\n(+) Ordered one of the Caesar salads just to see them prepare it table side. lol It was prepared much faster than I thought and tasted great!\n\n(-) those whipped potatoes were the only part of the meal that was not superb! They were actually quite disappointing and tasted like 'instant mashed potatoes'. Ugh. Definitely will avoid that next time!\n\nIt's a matter of when, not if, I will return to the Golden Steer! The steaks are big and tasty, the service is incredible, and the old school charm and history of the place is something I can't get enough of!!\n\nI really went back and forth between 4 or 5 stars, which is why I wish Yelp! would institute 1/2 stars into the rating system. I will likely update after some more visits...so for now it will be..\n\n4.5 stars!\n\nWoohoo! Pretty f*cking awesome!"

If you are hoping for anything beyond that, such as fresh mixed green salads, mind blowing sides, delicious seafood, or even a speck of modernity, I say skip it and head to one of the bajillion steak joints on the Strip. The Steer is Vegas, BABY, not the Vegas where what happens here stays here only in theory.\n\nWe went on a Saturday night, and it was dead. I was a bit concerned, but I was still grinning at the truly old school surrounds, complete with red banquettes and a live piano player. Service was relaxed; it could have been a bit more attentive in explaining the menu and getting our order in a prompt manner. (Casual is okay by the way as there were some old school locals there in their everyday getups.)  \n\nOur order included the chopped salad, the \"Ambassador of Tenderness\" (12 oz Filet) and onion rings. The salad is drenched in dressing and tossed table side, so you may want to request light dressing. It is basically an iceberg salad with some chickpeas and carrot sticks, nothing spectacular. The onion rings were breaded thickly, again okay, but I am still beholden to my Atlanta Varsity rings.\n\nThe steak, however, was perfect and lived up to its Ambassador title. Enough said.\n\nThey appear to have private rooms, so round up your Rat Pack and prepare for a protein feast."

He says you get the same thing for $65 a person so we all gave it a try.  \n\nThe atmosphere reminds me of an old time piano wine bar from the 70's/80's but a little run down in need of some updating.  Waiter was weird and had an attitude that kept growing throughout the night.  He told us how hed been there quite a long time but had left for a while and come back etc making a point I guess that most of them were there for 20+ years.  \n\nWe got a bottle of wine and then ordered.  I had the filet which was nicely cooked and the twice cooked potato.  The potato was actually about the worst i have ever had because it was obvious that it had sat in the oven either all day or for hours.  It was completely burnt on the bottom but not in a good way.  You know how you can totally overdo a potato skin to complete crispy browness that its cracking apart but it still tastes good?  Ya well not like that this was BURNT.  Could not cut it with a fork burnt.  Had to use a steak knife to get through it sooo cuz our waiter was weird with attitude I wasnt going to say anything about my $10 potato.  \n\nThe waiter came back at least 5 times aggressively asking if we wanted another bottle of wine.  It started to feel like it was a demand rather than a request which we all noticed.  At the end we all got dinner drinks/coffee and dessert.  The drinks came out right away and we had a nice conversation while we waited for dessert.  The restaurant only had 3 tables and I noticed 2 waiters and a couple bussers as well as the guy doing the salads and desserts so when we finished the drinks we asked where dessert was.  We were hoping to have it with the drinks but  its like 30 minutes or more later and the waiters response was really snotty that they only had one of those dessert trays and the guy was going to get to us.  We were there at 7 pm and the only people on dessert at the time.  \n\nWe didnt understand the really negative reaction we were getting so we were doing our best to be respectful responding with yes sir etc.  Its almost as if he mistook our kindness for weakness which seems to be happening a whole lot these days when you go out.\n\nSo I watched the dessert guy make our dessert and I noticed he was making cherries jubilee instead of the bananas foster we ordered so I said something about it in a very nice way LOL that doesnt seem to matter.  The response was almost like are you effing kidding me?  This bitch makes a mistake I gotta fix?  He didnt say that but his body language sure did.  The dessert guy went away the waiter comes back with more attitude and do you want another bottle of wine again.  He seemed pissed at us that the guy was making cherries and that we didnt want that as well.  \n\nThey finally made it right and I tasted one bite and not good.  We make it better at home.  Everyone at table agreed we make it better so good thing I got the tiramisu because that was pretty good.\n\nThis is the important part.  I would never have bothered writing any of this until this part happened!  The waiter brings the bill and most of the time my husband just takes care of it but this time I had a funny feeling about the waiter so I looked at it and thank the lord I did because that dude double charged us and charged us extra for stuff that already came with etc. For instance my husband ordered asparagus with Hollandaise sauce $11.  The waiter charged us for 2 of those $22 + Hollandaise sauce $5x 2 = $10 so his asparagus was $32.\n\nWhen we pointed out the errors to the waiter he seemed intensely aggravated.  He responded very quickly like he was expecting it.  I bet he was.  I bet they do that all night long.  He said oh when they put it in they must have made a mistake like someone else rang his order in and like it happens and he will have to go straighten \"them\" out.  Bill came back minus $150 but I am positive we still paid too much because that extra sauce crap didnt hit me til we got home that the asparagus already had Hollandaise on it and I just looked it up on the menu to be sure and yep sure enough.  \n\nBottom line:  These people can cook a steak but so can the Keg and Firebirds etc\n\nDO NOT TRUST YOUR WAITER:  Go over your bill  -  They are looking for suckers\n\nFair restaurant prices on bottles of wine\n\nNONE of us would ever return"

As for entrees: filet with crab legs (perfect) for me, a steak the size of his plate (dad), crab stuffed filet (I think) for hubs, and pasta with seafood for mom. Even though this was a highly anticipated visit with my parents from Ohio, no one spoke. The baked potatoes are big enough to share. Our table was literally overflowing with delicious food. So obviously I will go back...when I pay off this trip. I by no means think it was overpriced, but it was $500 after tip. The men each had a beer or two and my mom had a gin/tonic. The wine list looked fab and I would have indulged, but I was 7 months pregnant. The loss of a star is unfortunate- there was a group of females and older males in the back room; the \"ladies\" frequently walked past our table to the restroom and it definitely had a Goodfellas feel to it; which added to the atmosphere of old timey Vegas, but was unsettling nonetheless. Plus the hostess, while accommodating, was not dressed professionally. I just feel for a $500 dinner, I expect a higher standard. They have a dress code but hostess and much of clientele did not meet it.\nWe'll go back!!"

I found this place on yelp and was impressed since its one of or if not the oldest steak houses in Vegas. After dining here, I really don't understand how anyone could post a negative review. The outside entrance is very deceiving. It looks outdated and old but once you walk inside, WOW. This place is very classy and unique. Its a beautiful restaurant. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Our food was delicious. Our steaks were cooked just right and full of flavor. Yes, this is on the pricey side but it is worth every penny. My husband an I ordered their table side dessert Bananas Foster. OMG! I definitely will come back next time I'm in town. Fabulous place. Fine dining at its best!"

I can say that I have successfully tried all the steaks on the menu and this time I decided to try the pork chop.  My favorite place for a steak has just become my favorite place for a pork chop.\n\nThe table side service is excellent.  Salads prepped for the table, bananas foster and cherries jubilee are like a little show.  Thank you to Fernando and all the the staff there for always showing us a good time."

The build up was incredible, the food was a little meh. \n\nThe decor is very old school vegas. You can almost feel the energy that previously occupied this space. You can picture this place on a busy Friday in the late 50's or early 60's. We were seated in a large room in the back of the restaurant that we were told was used a meeting room by mob members visiting vegas and some of the members of the rat pack. Pretty cool.\n\nWe ordered our food and were all surprised with amount of food that came out. The portions are HUGE. I ordered a filet that while huge was a little bland. The twice baked potatoes were good but tasted like they'd been frozen at some point. The desert was okay but also had a frozen taste.\n\nif I was judging this restaurant on the food it would have been a 3 star review but the service was pretty awful. Just slow, unconcerned and borderline rude. \n\nNot saying I would never try this place again but for the money there is so many options that would blow this place out of the water."

The apps were excellent and the table side Caesar salad was the best I've ever had.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, but might have stood for just a bit more seasoning.  The lobster tail was very large and good, but a little chewy.  And cherries jubilee, are you kidding me?  Outstanding, you can never find that any more.  The service was outstanding, and thanks to the management who comped my son's meal before his deployment overseas.  Top notch!"

            "review": "I have driven by this restaurant hundreds, probably thousands, of times while growing up here in Vegas, and I had never tried out out until yesterday evening. I wish I had tried this place out earlier, as it proved to be some of the most excellent steak I have had in Vegas.\n\nThe real reason I held off on trying this place out for so long was the cost. It is an expensive restaurant, which each steak priced at least $35 and the Italian Specialties (Chicken Parmigiana, etc) running at about $26-$27. That being said, I did use a Groupon to eat here. The Groupon was good for $50, enough to really only cover one person.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant stands in stark contrast to the crappy strip mall that it resides in. It's dark, as classic Vegas restaurants tend to be, and has a wonderful atmosphere. It's definently obvious the place was built in 1958, and the history of the building is easy to see and feel.\n\nThe waiters couldn't have been nicer. They greeted me as though I were a regular in the place, and popped over my table from time to time to share stories about the more famous patrons (The Rat Pack, Elvis Presley, Mario Andretti) of the restaurant. Apparently, Robert De Niro's son also works here as a waiter, which doesn't make much sense...but hey, that's cool.\n\nAs an appetizer, I ordered the signature garlic bread ($5), which was pretty tasty. It's pretty much impossible not to make a huge mess when eating it, which makes it all the more fun. The regular bread was excellent as well, and came out so fresh and hot that I almost burned myself when I grabbed it. No complaints though, I'll take hot, fresh bread any day of the week :)\n\nFor the entree, I had the 14 oz. Top Sirloin steak ($37) and a side order of steak fries ($8). I am a seasoning and sauce fanatic...but this steak needed nothing extra. Much like Bob Taylor's Ranch House, the meat is cooked in such a way that the natural flavor of the meat is rich enough that no extra seasoning is necessary. \n\nWhen all was said and done, my bill came out exactly to $50, so I just had to throw the waiters a tip. It was truly an excellent meal, and I would consider this in the upper echelon of Vegas steakhouses."

            "review": "We've been wanting to go to the Golden Steer for so long due to the history and what we had heard about the food.  The ambiance is awesome, even though they pack people into the same corner until it's completely full when the other side of the room is empty.  Don't understand that concept, but server Mike was great, along with his crew.  He was on top of our needs throughout the evening.  There was a 3 combo appetizer special, both in hot and cold versions.  We got the hot version with calamari, ravioli and stuffed mushroom.  We had forgotten about all the bad reviews on the mushrooms.  Needless to say, the other reviews are accurate.  The mushrooms were awful and cold.  In fact, none of the appetizer plates were real hot.  The calamari and ravioli are mediocre at best and the ravioli is breaded a fried (didn't expect that and it was not good).  The term I used throughout the evening was \"ordinary\".  We also ordered the Caesar Salad, sans anchovy paste, and it was cool having it made at your table.  Taste was what you would expect, but for the price, I would have at least expected the large pieces of cheese you get on nice salads and perhaps homemade croutons...instead we had shaker cheese and croutons out of a bag.  Nothing to write home about with the salad.  For dinner, my husband ordered the Veal Parmigiana.  After the first bite, I could tell it was awful...he was not impressed and was real disappointed since we expected to have a really good dinner.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye, as it's a specialty there....and it was very good and cooked to a perfect medium-rare.  They can do steaks just fine.  For the sides, we ordered the mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The broccoli was barely cooked, so very crunchy and had absolutely nothing on it; no olive oil, butter...nothing.  Couldn't eat it so packed it to take home and steam myself with some olive oil.  The mashed potatoes were ok, but nothing stellar.  I could eat those, but took most of it home.  Finally, for dessert, I ordered bananas foster for one.  It's cool they make it table side with the fire show and it was really good.  Glad there was a good dessert after a mostly disappointing meal.  Tab was around $225...and definitely not worth it.  We won't have dinner there again, but are glad we went and now finally know!  Way too much $$ for mediocre (at best) food."

I'd been there before and like the ambiance (even though it's a bit worn), but I don't like being cheated, so I won't be back. Read on if interested.\n\nWe arrived early and had a drink at the bar. I ordered a very standard Cosmo, which the very grouchy bartender, who barely acknowledged us, is apparently unable to make. I asked him what he had put in it that made it so sweet, and he responded that he'd put in... pineapple juice! It was quite yucky and it was obvious that I was not happy, yet he made no attempt to make me happy. My dad doesn't like the fuss, so we paid for the drinks and took them into the dining room when the table was ready.\n\nThe nice waiter asked me if everything was ok with my drink, and I said I hated it. He was fantastic and immediately offered to give me a real Cosmo (for free, of course). He went and fetched it from the bar and I was definitely pleased with that. The food was decent, but not outstanding. However, when the  bill came, I saw that I was charged for a Cosmo -- what a job! I'd paid for the first one at the bar and the second one was supposed to be comped. Turns out the hostess and the waiter thought I'd ordered the first one from the waiter and thus charged me for it. How is that possible? They saw me walk into the dining room with the drink and he was the one who asked me if I had enjoyed it, and since he hadn't taken the order, it was clear that the drink must have come from the bar. I was quite flabbergasted by this and told the waiter to take the drink off the bill. He said it would take 15 minutes to do this, as they were so busy. What? THat's insane. As an alternative, he offered another drink instead. I didn't want another drink. as I had to drive, but they made it very clear to me that it was terribly inconvenient for them to remove this drink -- which was their mistake in the first place. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I will most certainly not recommend this place to tourist friends. I don't want them to get bad drinks and then get cheated!"

Met at the bar brought to our table, forgot to give menus which was not so terrible. Took another 30 minutes if not more before a waiter decided to come over. My glass of water was not replenished once throughout the meal. The waiter put on his best de Niro game face and tried to make light of the situation. But when diners are spending the kind of money we spent or would have spent more the service should have been top notch instead we were treated like this was steak and ale. Will not be back."
