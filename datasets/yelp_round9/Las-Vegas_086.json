            "review": "I'm not from Vegas, so I'm not sure if this is a restaurant chain, but it surely has a chain atmosphere to it. Think of it as a nicer Macaroni Grill with better food. I ordered the seafood risotto and very much enjoyed it, but the shrimp were not fully cooked and still a little blue. We had to take it home to recook it on the stove. The risotto itself was enjoyable though. Service wasn't excellent, but not terrible. The server notified us that one of the entree we ordered was not available about 15 minutes after all of us ordered, which she should have known ahead of time or notified us earlier, but no harm done."

We sat at the bar because all the couches were taken. Delmar was amazing:) Excellent service. He was so nice and even made my sis and I a yummy shot because she recently turned 21. Cute! Kind! And good at what he did. No complaints here lol oh and the food is always good. Next time I go here I'd like to see the actual menu though. I'm sure it's delish. Dessert was also very good! Overall this place is great to go out on date or hang out with the girls."

The food was fresh and served as it should be. Tasty,hot, promptly delivered in order not ahead and not too slow. Tamara went out of her way to see that our meal was excellent and it was appreciated in my tip. They also have the best tasting flat bread to nibble on while you wait for appetizers and main course. To my shock I discovered that this is actually part of a chain. This is the best chain I have ever eaten at for Italian food. The impression was more like a fine dining experience in beverly hills or pasadena. I think that they have an incredible future if they stick to this formula. Meticulous attention to detail and of course great tasting food. I will definitely be back as I live in summerlin and I discovered they have a place at tivoli."

Nope...yellow lettuce, chicken tasted gross and barely any dressing . Manager asked if I wanted a new one...uhhh no! If you can screw up a salad then you got probs! Service slow..food not up to par.

The best part is that even though it's only Monday-Friday, they honor it on national holidays.\n\nI love their sausage ricotta flatbread and their beef carpaccio.

If portion size is too small for you...ORDER ANOTHER IT'S ONLY TWO NINETY FIVE!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n- BRIO Burger - \nFor 2.95 i was expecting one or two slider sized burgers. Nope they serve a FULL SIZED burger cut into quarters. The beef patty is pretty darn tasty but there's no condiments so after a few bites it could get pretty dull. Couple this with the salad from the Shrimptini or from the carpaccio and sauce it with the sauce from the shrimp and eggplant. \n\n- Ravioli Caprese - \nNot bad but no meat. The sauce ultimately makes the dish. Go early and they'll flood that plate with sweet tasty sauce, go late and there'll be a a few slabs of sauce on the plate.\n\n- Chorizo Fonduta -\nThe 'Meh' of the menu. The fondu is a bit salty and is very rich.\n\n- Beef Carpaccio - \nThin strips of raw beef with a spring salad on top drizzled with some kind of mustard sauce with capers. WIN. \n\n- Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant -\nDont really like eggplant very much but OH MAN THAT SAUCE IS GOOD!!!\n\n- Margherita Flatbread - \nVery nice, Very tasty, Could use more basil but overall it's perfect as a starter\n\n- Shrimptini - \nAlready peeled shrimp in a martini glass filled with tasty salad. Very refreshing and awesome as a starter or in between rich dishes like the shrimp and eggplant\n\n- Sliced Steak Bruschetta - \nAll you taste is the cheese and the greens but still this brushetta is DAMN tasty!!"

That'll be a future review.\n\nTheir happy hour is legit. I would say better than Yardhouse happy hour, but then again I'm not a big fan of Yardhouse. Their food menu is great. Multiple options for only $3.95 each!!! And drink specials are only $5!! And they aren't little skimpy appetizers either. Order about 2 or 3 items along with drinks, you'll definitely get full (well at least I did.) \n\nWe ordered the spinach artichoke dip, shrimp piccante, margherita flatbread, brio burger and 4 cocktails. All came out to $35!!! Not bad for an afternoon of food and drink. Their peach sangria was definitely tastey and I was already on my second one even before the food came. All the items we ordered were delish. Good portions with a lot of flavor on each. Easy to share and reasonable on the price. The bar was busy so the bartenders weren't really on the chatty side. In conclusion, I would say this was a successful happy hour!!!"

            "review": "Brio in Town Square is gorgeous! They did a great job making it a very intimate Italian atmosphere. My boyfriend made a reservation at 7:45pm and we checked in at 7:40pm, but we did not get seated until 8pm. When we finally got seated with our party of four, our waitress came up. She never told us her name, but we felt like she could have been more friendly and more interactive with us. She took our drink orders, but it took about 10 mins for us to actually get 4 waters and 1 beer. We did see that it was pretty busy, so we did not complain. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad. My boyfriend ordered the mushroom pasta and our friends ordered the steak that looked absolutely amazing and the chicken pesto. Once we ordered the food it took about 30 to 45 mins for them to get it out to us. We understand it was busy and the steak would take a while to cook. Our waitress came and gave us our food, but did not speak. I will give her props for not reaching over us, but coming to our side and bring the food directly to us on our side. My food was delicious! What I really felt was amazing about this Brio was the team work I saw being conducted. Whenever anyone saw empty plates at our table, it did not matter if it was our waitress or the manager in the suit and tie, they came over and asked if they could take the dishes for us. That really impressed our table. I plan to come back with my boyfriend for another date night, but the reason why I gave them a 3 star out of 5 was primarily due to the waitress that was not so friendly. \n\nBrio Tuscan Grille at Town Square can be found right in front of the Victoria Secret and the entrance is beside the Kay Jewelers.  They do offer a beautiful outside seating area if you are interested."

Even their dessert has a nice selection that compliments coffee or tea perfectly.\n\nThe restaurant itself is really nice too.  Its typical Tuscon decoration but it goes above and beyond.  \n\nI've always had good service here so I have no complaints about that (lets face it, any restaurant can have a bad waiter at any time).\n\nThere is patio dining as well which I like because I love to people watch.\n\nIt is a little bit pricy, but the food quality is better than most. \n\nAll in all Brio is enjoyable."

For all of us locals look past the good dishes and sangria, the service in the place is a joke. I typically sit at the bar during my visits and have never had an issue. However on this occasion we sat I the dinning room. We we seated immediately on a late Sunday evening and waited over 15 minutes for a server to greet us. Not only that, she walked by us several times and never said a word to us! You know it's terrible service when a young woman at the table next to us tells us \"that we have he patience of a saint, I would have left long ago.\" For being a local and someone who actually works in Town Square too, try your luck at McFadden's or Yardhouse. At least they greet you right away at those restaurants AND they won't ignore you."

We had a reservation and we were seated within minutes so no real waiting. \n\nI got to enjoy Berries & Cream stuffed French toast with applewood bacon. It was a bit overwhelming due to how sweet it was but what do you expect with stuffed French toast drizzled with honey and syrup. Nonetheless, it was yummy!!! \n\nThe service was ok. I felt like our server was getting irritated a couple times but then he would snap out of it.

Yesterday, 11/11/14, one of many visits, we had warm, fresh baked sourdough bread, creamy lobster bisque, the perfectly salty artichoke dip and the chicken and bacon panini. Everything was phenomenal and came out perfectly timed! We shared the white peach sangria and it was crisp, sweet and refreshing. Our server was a tall male with short brownish blonde hair and he split all of our portions in two for us! What an above and beyond task. Thank you Brio for always making us happy and full!"

            "review": "From my first visit in 2008 to many, many visits in the last five years, I have enjoyed EVERY meal and experience. Perfect for an intimate evening with your beau, a light lunch with your shopping partner, or a celebratory meal with a group.\n\nHaving dined here so often, there are few dishes I haven't tried. These are my favorite that are classics and, unfortunately, some items that have since been removed from the menu (seasonal, making room for new dishes):\nCALAMARI FRITTO MISTO: It's no surprise that I love calamari and it's one of my *benchmark* dishes to try at new restaurants. I like their batter, the lightly-battered peperoncini that creates a nice, refreshing note, and their delicious marinara for dipping. I do not like the creamy sauce (not really sure what it is) that is also served.\nLOBSTER BISQUE: This is definitely one of the best lobster bisques (or bisques in general) that I have eaten. Nice pieces of lobster and this version is finished with a touch of sherry. Delicious. BTW, the cup is enough; trust me, don't go for the bowl unless that is all you're planning to eat.\nPOLLO AL FORNO FLATBREAD: Grilled chicken, tomatoes, bacon, feta cheese, green onions with a tomato sauce and creamy parmesan. SERIOUS YUM. The bread is the perfect thickness, creating the right vehicle for this delicious medley of ingredients. Sadly, this is no longer on the Vegas menu!\nCHICKEN MILANESE: Romano breaded chicken with herb spaghetti served in my favorite sauce - pomodoro. The breading is crispy without overwhelming the dish and I love their interpretation of the pomodoro.\nCHICKEN LIMONE: PIccata-style chicken with a blend of lemon, capers, and white wine - another preparation I really enjoy. The chicken breast is always juicy and the sauce is tangy. They used to serve it with their cripsy potatoes (large chucks of well-fried/sauteed potatoes with herbs and peppers - think \"Potatoes O'Brien\"), which I really liked.\n\nThere are many salads, appetizers, pastas, flatbread, and bruschetta that they offer, I've eaten, and have enjoyed very much. You can't go wrong! The only dish that was less than satisfactory was the Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto; bleh.\n\nThis year, they introduced \"The Lighter Side of Tuscany\" with menu items that have reduced calories (I believe they are all below a certain amount, say 600). I tried the INSALATA BRIO: Mixed greens, roasted red peppers, grilled asparagus, tomatoes, grapes and candied pecans tossed with an Italian vinaigrette and balsamic drizzle. Just 345 calories! Well, I removed the gorgonzola and asked for the dressings on the side, so that I could get it as \"Vegan\" as possible. Very delicious!\n\nThey have a specials menu that is updated daily, so make sure to check it out because their seasonal cocktails are certainly worthwhile. Some of my favorites that were offered in the past (and I believe one may have become a permanent menu offering) are the STRAWBERRY BASIL LIMONATA (Muddled strawberries and basil in a limonata, so refreshing and yummy) and the APPLE CIDER MARTINI (A little brandy, apple cider, spiced rum, lemon juice, rimmed with cinnamon, YUMMM). I've recreated both cocktails at home and it has consistently been a crowd-pleaser."

Here's the breakdown:\n\nAtmosphere: Gorgeous! I love the decor of this restaurant and it's high ceilings. It's always decorated so lovely during this holidays.\n\nFood: Overall, good.\n\nCalamari- bland. It needed the accompanying sauces to make it have any flavor.\n\nSpinach & Artichoke dip- very tasty, although the crackers that come with it are not a good match for the dip. The crackers are asiago cheese crackers and the asiago conflicts with the cheese in the dip. I ended up just getting more bread and using that with the dip. It was much better. \n\nChopped Salad- Tasty, but very onion heavy. Don't go kissing anyone after eating this salad!\n\nLasagna- delicious. Cooked perfectly. \n\nService: Just AWFUL. Our server NEVER came by. Our meal took over 2 hours. It was ridiculous. Now, I could have understood if the place was crazy busy, but it really wasn't. You know it's bad when you have to ask the busybody multiple times to get our server. We got there around 8pm and didn't leave until well after 10pm.\n\nPrices: Very fair. The portion size and quality is in line with the prices.\n\nOverall, I will come back to Brio for their food and atmosphere, but if I get seated in the section of the server we had again I am going to request to move to a different table, as I have a life and would like to get to it someday, rather than spending it at a 3 hour dinner."

My mom and I Planned on coming to town square to hang out and do some shopping and we we're both hungry so I remembered Brio had a happy hour and it was almost 4 so perfect timing. \n\nWe came in and sat by the bar for happy hour and I was kind of worried it would be too hot since it was hot outside , but the bar area is shaded so it worked out fine. Even if you do sit by the patio by the walkway and street they have misters and umbrellas. \n\nI decided to have a white peach Sangria which is $4 on the happy hour menu it was so refreshing and perfect for the hot weather and presented very pretty. My mom had a virgin Italian Lemonade because she was scared to drive with a drink in her :). For food we decides to go with Crispy Eggplant Fries ( recommended by a friend on yelp Thanks Nieves ! ) crispy ravioli and Tomato Mozzerella Salad just to start. The eggplant fries were perfectly crispy and super yummy. The pomodoro sauce for both the ravioli and fries was so yummy. The raviolis lacked flavor in my opinion. The tomato Mozzerella salad was really fresh and the balsamic glaze was perfect. It could have had more basil and glaze but that's ok. I just asked for some more glaze ;). I'm glad we only ordered those three dishes because a few raviolis in and some fries later I was stuffed. \n\nAll the servers were friendly and food and drinks came out fast. Despite how busy it was. I suggest coming early and seeing if there is a wait because it filled up fast for happy hour. I will definitely be coming back to try the regular menu as I'm lasagna lover and I'm out to find the best in vegas. That I'm yet to find maybe it's hiding here at Brio. I'll find out sooner or later."

There are dramatic high ceilings with beautifully draped material flowing from the rafters.  The place is huge and although there is a wait at times, it moves along quickly.\n\nThe food has been consistently good. Being Italian, I dislike Italian chain restaurants, but this is not one of them.  The ravioli is superb as is all of their pasta dishes judging from the reaction of our guests and our own experience.  Their desserts are wonderful, and they even have \"tapas\" size to make you feel less guilty.\n\nThe newest location in Summerlin is smaller and a little less showy than the Town Square site. However, this just makes it a totally different experience; same great food, but \"cozier\" feel.  Lots of fun on a Saturday when the Farmers Market sets up at the site!\n\nFor lunch or dinner, this place is a sure hit."

For my entree I ordered the Filet and it was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this dish, if you're in the mood for steak. I went with a group, so I was able to try several other items as well. The pork chops were delicious, but I don't eat much pork these days. If I did, I might order this myself. The lobster bisque was just okay. The last thing I tried was the Shrimp Mediterranean and it was the best of all. It's served with orzo pasta, which is my favorite.\n\nI've been to Brio several times and I have yet to be disappointed. It's a place that I know I will visit again when I'm in the area."

This was our first sit down Italian restaraunt and it was pretty good. They gave you good size proportions and we had to take it to go.  The pasta was very yummy and soft..almost like homemade pasta.

Rachel was our server.. She had no personality nor did she try to up sell a single item on the menu. I like to offer my guests a glass of wine or a beverage to start. It seems like she just wanted us out of there because we had 2 young teens with us. I felt like we were rushed and not given the proper service we deserved. I made a reservation through open table and noted a birthday.. She could've at least greeted us with a happy birthday? Instead when dessert time came around she just left the dessert menu on the table without even explaining to us what was on it. I'll be back for the food.. But definitely get out of Rachel's section! I have better customer service at McDonald's. At least the workers there smile and are polite. I'm now on my way to have drinks elsewhere"

My husband and 7-year old daughter were out shopping at Town Square, and wanted to grab some lunch.  We stumbled upon Brio and weren't sure if we were dressed properly (underdressed) but were treated as if we were first-class diners from start to finish. \n\nTo cut to the chase, from the moment we walked in until the second we left we were treated with the best customer service we've experienced in a restaurant in ages.  Our server (Tammy) was superbly kind, helpful, expedient and professional.  Our drinks came out in a flash, as did everything else.  The food was absolutely D-I-V-I-N-E.  We had the house margaritas (delish!), the chopped  salad (amazing), the Lobster Bisque (to die for!) and for our entrees, the petite filet \"Tournedos di Manzo\" the \"Mushroom Ravioli al Forno\", and for our daughter, the kids' lasagne.  My daughter especially liked the kids' fruit smoothie (by far the best smoothie, I've ever tasted), but wasn't too crazy about the lasagne.  I think it was due to the Italian sausage in it... she's not too crazy about Italian sausage. \nWhat stuck out: the beautiful decor, the very friendly and very attentive serving staff, the \"dough-ball\" given to us to play with while we waited (which, we were told, could be baked before we left) and the extremely unique and tasteful food.\nAll-in-all, a wonderful dining experience, and we will absolutely return!"

My husband and I had our wedding rehearsal dinner here also, so it's near and dear to my heart.\n\nYou start off with a basket of free bread, and Parmesan crusted sesame crackers that are delicious. I ask for oil and vinegar as opposed to the butter that comes out with it regularly.\n\nThe menu has a wonderful variety of salads, pasta, fish, chicken and steaks. My favorite menus items include: the strawberry chicken salad, steak salad, and chopped salad , the ricotta stuffed pasta in the spicy vodka sauce, the lobster bisque,  salmon Fresca, and also the beef medallions. I'm picky about my steak being cooked all the way through, and they always do a great job.\n\nThis place is also super kid friendly. Crayons to color on the paper tablecloth, and the most delicious kids size Mac and cheese that is easily shareable for two children. \n\nBrio, don't you go anywhere."

They also have good deals for the drinks . But keep in mind that happy hour is available only in the bar area ! It's from 3:30-6:30 Monday - Friday . \n\nI've eaten here non happy hour a few times , and it was okay , it's a totally different experience in my opinion. I had the risotto and it was okay portions were good but it did not wow me . \n\nThe main area is really pretty and they have outdoor seating as well so you can people watch if that's your thing . For hot days , they also have mists to keep their patrons cool on their patio. \n\nI love you brio !"

We were not even told it was wrong once, only that it would arrive in a few minutes.  We decided to cancel the meal since everyone was waiting to start their dinner so that one person would not be eating alone. The waitress said \"let me get the manager\".  He came over and was a complete ass.  He said \"what seems to be the problem?\" So we told him our issue and his reply was \" we are making it on the fly\".  Well if he knew what the problem was why did he ask? And then when it came to the bill the waitress said \"I wish you would have ordered dessert, it was on the house\".

We sat down about 7pm.  We were sat at a table for 6 people.  The wait staff did not remove the extra settings and we finally asked them to take them away.  We were given lunch menus and had to ask for dinner menus.  The bread came and it was cold and hard and the breadstick like items were soggy.  My friend tried to order a pale style beer, didn't have one, ordered a lager, didn't have one so he got a Sam Adams.  I ordered a whiskey sour, i couldn't taste the whiskey, drank it ordered another one and it was totally different than the first one, neither of them had a cherry.  They told us when we first sat down that there were only 4 lobster bisque soups left, my friend said he would take one, a minute later they brought us two and we still didn't even have the dinner menus, they took them away and gave them to another table which I thought was against health code.  We asked for more bread and got the same as before.  I ordered the shrimp venuto (or similar) and it when I came it was obvious it sat under the hear lamp for some time.  I thought it was terrible and actually spit out a few bites and didn't finish it.  Our friends pasta dishes also looked like they sat under a heat lamp for a while and no one finished their meals or even asked for a to go box, that's how bad the food was.  Our waters were not filled unless asked.  All in all a very bad dining experience, so bad I felt compelled to yelp.  Hopefully we just experience an off night. But with so many other dining venue to solicit, we will not be going back to the Brio."

That probably didn't make much difference though as it was extremely unexceptional.  I tried half of the chicken club and half of the burger.

I'm normally a red wine kinda gal, but seeing as this was recommended by both my boyfriend and the server I decided to give it a try. It was good until (almost) the last drop...last few sips tasted like straight soda. \n\n    On to the food. I have had quite a few beef carpaccios in my day but none come even CLOSE to comparing to the one they have at Brio. It was about half the size of me, unbelievably fresh and drizzled in what tasted like a garlic aioli. Mind. Blown. The Caprese salad was pretty tasty as well but needed a bit more balsamic glaze; I was too emanored by the carpaccio to remember to ask for more hehe. We also had the bruschetta quattro, Pasta Brio and the special bruschetta, which was a spicy shrimp with lobster butter. I, being allergic to shellfish, could not have the special bruschetta, hence why we ordered this way.\n\n    I deducted a star because the shrimp bruschetta was on the serving plate with the other assorted bruschettas. My allergy is not deathly so I simply avoided the pieces on either side of the shrimp, but as a server they should be a little more careful when a guest states they have an allergy. Hives aren't exactly my idea of a \"fun\" Friday night. \n\n   On a side note: The Pasta Brio tastes just as good cold as it does fresh out of the kitchen."

I've had a few things here that were just ok, which is why I gave it a 4 star and not 5.  \n\nThe gorgonzola crusted lamb chops were delicious, but heavy (as lamb can be, but still).  They were good but needed something lighter to go with it rather than the olive oil covered spinach.  Bruschetta was pretty good, I recommend the sausage or the prosciutto tomato basil one.  The one with steak was too dried out.  The food was still good though and the ambiance is great!"

He only came by after we commented to another waiter, twice, to ask my girlfriend if she wanted more alcohol... \"No thanks, buddy, I'm good on water over here.\"\n\nThe food was still delicious, but we won't come back without making sure we get seated in Phillip's section.

I ordered the Mezza Chicken Under the Brick, while my friends ordered an omelet and a risotto lunch special with salad. The breads for the table were delicious! My favorite was the crispy one with sesame seeds. I wish the butter was softer and more spreadable.\n\nThe Mezza Chicken, listed under 500 calories, was a good lunch-sized portion. The chicken was delicious and absorbed the mushroom flavored gravy it was topped with; but the vegetables were my favorite. They were seasoned very well and I loved the slight char on all of them. The mashed potatoes were light and provided a great contrast to the vegetables and chicken.\n\nOur server was great and friendly. There was a mistake on our order, where we were charged an extra $5 for a salad that was included in the lunch special. When we pointed it out, she apologized and remedied it. I would definitely come here again, and I hope the location near home will be as beautiful as this one."

Brio Tuscan Grille is at the heart of Town Square, and since it's a ways off The Strip, it's not bustling with tourists. Sitting outside at the bar on a warm Spring afternoon...=) SO PEACEFUL! \n\nBEEF CARPACCIO - This one is my favorite! The meat is sliced super super thin and goes so well with the mustard aioli and field greens. \n\nSLICED STEAK BRUSCHETTA - This one is a close runner up. Some bites you may find the gorgonzola to be overpowering. I think the steak and bruschetta could've done without the cheese. Nevertheless, YUM! \n\nBRIO BURGER - Okay, but kind of dry and plain. Not a fan of the chips it comes with either. Sliced into fours for sharing!\n\nRAVIOLI CAPRESE - Three giant raviolis. Super cheesy and tastes like it was fried. So unless you douse each bite with tomato sauce, it gets dry.\n\nSHRIMPTINI - I was pleasantly surprised with this! The're very generous with the shrimp! Super cute presentation and uber refreshing.\n\nI looked over at the party of 2 sitting right next to us...turns out they ordered the exact same 5 dishes. Must be a good sign! Our waiter also recommended the SPICY SHRIMP AND EGGPLANT, but we didn't have enough stomach room. \n\nWhere else can you stuff 2 people with such quality food for less than $20, tax and tip included?!

Based on their menu, there's enough of a selection for everyone.  \n\nThere's even a \"Lighter Side Menu\", which I chose to partake in. Lighter side choices range from lean steaks, chicken, salmon, salads, and some white fish (i.e. Mahi Mahi and Tilapia). Of course, I went with their 5 oz Filet Brio.  This was served with asparagus and sweet potato.  You can't go wrong with grilled asparagus and their sweet potato was amazing.  My only issue with both...wish I had more.  As for their 5 oz filet, I had this cooked medium-well.  In the last 2 weeks I've had steak at least 3 other times at well respected steakhouses.  No joke...I think Brio's was up there in tenderness, taste, and presentation.  My entree was less than 400 calories and a little over $20.  Bang for your buck without a bang on your nutrition!\n\nThe ambiance was great. You gotta love the tall ceilings.  Our server was great as well. I know that this is an Italian restaurant and I didn't get anything Italian.  But their steaks are good and for that alone, I am a fan.  \n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (485/500)"

The strip steak I had was nothing to write home about; it lacked that \"grilled\" flavor you would expect of a steak being served in a fine dining establishment. Portion-wise- it was a decent size. The accompanying mashed potatoes were hot and cold, suggesting they were microwaved. Their texture was like the flour and water you used to make a paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 project in elementary school. As for flavor, well let's just say they did not even come close to being a \"fine dining\" entree; even KFC delivers a better mashed potato. The veggies were worse! My veggies were so overcooked, they reminded me of the shriveled aliens you see in sci-fi movies. Visually, they were simply gross looking.  Thankfully, their flavor was better, but not by much.  Definitely not a \"fine food\" entree!\n\nOVERALL DINING EXPERIENCE:  Double thumbs dow."

I loved the atmosphere and the food was so good the service was top notch. You start off with salad bar lobster bisque and they have sushi too. The waiters come round with all sorts of meats and sliced right at ur table and all the varieties of the meats I can't count em all... However my favorite was bacon wrapped filet mignon . I even had a birthday cheese cake and everyone sang to me. I highly recommend you try this place when out in Vegas . I will be coming again and I'm bringing my kids. What an experience ."

Seated ourselves near the little booths by the bar. It took 13 minutes just for a menu. NOT COOL.luckily my boyfriend and I have some amazing conversations or else I don't know how else to let the time pass. \n\nWe eventually got our menus l, took a look. In a matter of minutes, especially after waiting so long for a menu, we finally are ready to give her the rundown on everything we want. \n\nWe keep seeing the same server rush back and forth so we keep waiting. After we see her and have her tell us she's about ready to take our drink order, she looks over and sees a party of 20 rush outside. \nWhere do you think our server went?!\n\nNever got to put that drink order in :( \nAll we wanted was a nice happy hour!\nAfter all, grandma had the little one all day so we might as well take advantage. \n\nAfter being so patient to try out this elegant restaurant, we thought maybe yard house was a better choice. They know us there so there's never waiting for a drink! \n\n\nMaybe we gotta be dressed lookin like a million bucks, or go with a fat group! \nI wanna try it again, my man was just really tryin to get that happy hour on so it might take a little convincing."

Well unfort. found out that day due to the Vegas winds they close their patio so I was stuck having a big group coming & expecting Happy Hour menu prices. Luckly I spoke with the manager, Craig who was so nice to accommodate for my group & I & set us up in their Chef's room with Craig as our waiter. They let us order off of the HH menu. Was so grateful that my plans were not ruined & I wouldn't be disappointing my Meetup groups!! Thank you so much Craig!!! Craig, our waiter was great too! They have great choices for drinks & food on their HH menu. Fried ravioli is so yummy! Along with their shrimp & eggplant dish. I was soooo full due to their reasonable servings! The Rosa Sangria is delicious & light! I have been here before & definitely  will go back & highly recommend  this place!!!  Town Square is such a great location too with lots of shopping to do afterwards & walk off the food!"

This particular location has paid close attention to the aesthetics, which from a designer's point of view is always appreciated. \n\nMore important however, when considering any restaurant with multiple locations and above-average prices is the food and service. Again, I have yet to be disappointed. Considering the brusque treatment I got at the Grotto in the Golden Nugget, I was afraid that might be par for the course. Thankfully it isnt. \n\nBrio's Vegas location in a walking mall is a nice change from the more parking lot-oriented locations in other states. Its nice to be on a patio that isnt overlooking only cars but real pedestrians going about their business. \n\nFor a nice bite of Italian close to McCarran, Brio's Las Vegas location gets my nod."

And there definitely are points that embrace the chain restaurant blandness (atmosphere), but thankfully, the food is done well. I had the portobello ravioli and my date had the frutti di mare (it was a special). The ravioli was excellent. While the frutti was not as good as Mezzo's take on the dish, it still held up and was satisfying. Our service was adequate and friendly. Overall, most people will be pleased with the restaurant's large menu, quality, and moderate pricing. If you find yourself in Town Square with a group of people, odds are everyone will find something they like here."

After submitting my complaint to Brio's management, they took exceptionally thorough remedial measures to correct the issues I had.  They talked to the waiter and offered a discount on my next meal.  I understand that screwups happen, but when a restaurant takes the effort to mitigate the poor experience, that's worth a lot to me.  It means the restaurant does care about your dining experience.  The management staff was very attentive to my concerns and I would go back to give them a second chance. :)\n\n(Prior Review)\n\nFor 75 dollars for a group of three, this place is was a major disappointment.  The decor is nice with vaulted ceilings.  The ambiance is loud but acceptable.  The problems with this place are significant.  I can recommend the carbonara since it was the only dish that was properly seasoned.  My two associates ordered the lobster risotto and veal scallopini.  Both dishes were sent back for being underseasoned.  The risotto was overcooked and thereby mushy with only a hint of lobster taste.  The scallopini was so underseasoned that my associate had to cover it in vegetables to give it some flavor.  The service was equally disappointing.  Our bill was mixed up with another table.  If I didn't check the receipt, I would have overpaid.  I informed the waiter who corrected the mistake.  However, when I asked for the receipt showing the prior charge was voided, he argued that the receipt was fixed.  I think he was too busy trying to argue with me that he wasn't listening to what I was asking for.  He then blamed me for not being clear.  Holy crap.  Are you serious?!  I left a 4 dollar tip only because leaving ZERO is reserved for particularly egregious service but this case came close."

Better than olive garden, but what isnt? Today was my first time there for happy hour and I may become a regular. \n\nNo drink specials except $5 martinis on Thursdays, but their cocktails are pretty reasonable. However they have one of the best food specials - a nice variety of things for $2.95. We went with the beef carpaccio, pepperoni sausage flat bread, brio burger and shrimp cocktail. I didn't expect much for the price, so it was a pleasant surprise that all of the food was a good sized portion and plated nicely. \n\nCarpaccio was fresh and served with some greens on top - so perfect for a summer evening on the patio. Burger looked like those preformed Costco patties but it was cooked perfectly medium and yummy with a soft tasty bun. Flat bread was the perfect size for two and the dollops of I'm guessing goat cheese? on each piece was a great finish. Shrimp cocktail wasn't a typical cocktail - cocktail sauce on the bottom with tossed romaine and 4 or 5 ok sized shrimp on top. Everything in it was fresh and good. I'm betting it's a lot better than that sketchy 99cent shrimp cocktail downtown. \n\nMy friends white peach sangria was a little sweet, I loved my strawberry basil lemonade (non alcoholic). There were some issues with the bill re the drinks, but the manager was quick to take care of it. Service at the bar was pretty great - bartender was attentive, everything came out quickly. The manager seemed very hands on. He kept making sure we were ok, that our food was coming and immediately corrected the bill. \n\nI may have to try Brio for lunch or dinner again soon. Hopefully that experience will be as good as today's."

I wasn't going to get home till way past midnight so I needed to grab some food. I wanted to check out Brio, but assumed it would be super expensive and I felt silly spending $40 to eat by myself. I headed on over to CPK but it was overpriced and I wasn't in love with anything I saw on the menu. Despite my reservations, I checked out Brio and Wow! They're actually cheaper than CPK!\n\nI went inside and was told it would be 10-20 minutes for a table for one. I was mid-heel turn when the hostess told me I could eat at the bar. The weather was gorgeous and the bartender was very friendly. I ordered the chopped salad and lobster bisque ($1 up charge) deal. The bread basket is amazing with the best crispy flat breads and sourdough I've ever had. My total, with tax and tip came out to $11, which isn't bad whatsoever. When my sister showed up, the waitress told me the Dr. Pepper was on her that I ordered for my sister, which was nice of her. Forget the Strip, my sister and I agreed that this would be our go to restaurant from now on. \n\nBecause I enjoyed my first visit so much, two days later, 4/18/11, after hitting up the 51's game, Beau S. and I headed over here for some after the game drinks. We walked right in to a fairly empty restaurant. We went to the bar and were told it was happy hour. I got beef carpaccio and he got the steak bruschetta and they were each $2.95. It was a great deal and I loved all the capers that came with my carpaccio. I got a soda water and Beau got some sort of beer. We also split a caffe panna cotta that was out of this world. The total, with tip was $15. Really great deal. \n\nObviously, I'll be back for a third time!"

This is the place to celebrate family birthdays, bring people when visiting from out of town. I have had very good experience with staff until tonight. My son's 14 bday dinner. The waiter was the most clueless waiter I have seen comparing to restaurants in the level of Brio. From the beginning, he forgot to bring my soup, i didnt bring it up thinking it was an honest mistake. Then, i was without a drink for 21 minutes and when I asked him, he never brought it. My daughter had to go to the bar area to ask and another gentleman who brought my drink while our waiter was high fiving and hugging every girl including the hostesses that would cross his path. When our dinner came out, we usually get a \"Did your dinner come out ok?\" from a regular waiter. This guy said \" Are you all happy now?\" After the drink incident which im sure someone told him about it, he didnt even recognized and owned up to his mistake but ignored it completely. To top it off, he comes towards the end to ask if we wanted dessert(Of course we said no) and made a comment if our party of 4 switched places on the table....I just had to make a comment to see if he gets it and I said; \"Maybe you should come around more often\"...that comment flew in front of his forehead and he didnt even have a reaction to it.....I have never seen this guy before but next time I go and if i decide to go back to this location, I will make sure I dont get this waiter and run away from his area. Tivoli Village location is almost the same distance for me. I guess i will make that decision later. I consider myself a good tipper(20% to 25%) for average service. At the same time, I give less and even $0 if the experience is a disaster like tonight.

But it didnt feel like any italian restaurant ive ever been to. not that thats a bad thing. the bread they put on the table was somewhat epic. im not sure ive ever said that about bread, but it was. the butter was on the sweeter side but the bread was so good it didnt need butter. for an entree i ordered the chicken pomodoro classico. probably the best pasta dish ive ever had in vegas. Direct from the menu...\"Angel hair with grilled chicken, tomatoes, pine nuts, basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano and pesto drizzle 14.15\"...yum. the pine nuts were a really nice touch.\n\nwhat i dont understand though is why they dont have gingerale. the waitress was really sweet and tried to make it by mixing pepsi with sprite. but it didnt taste like gingerale. so i just had a pepsi. \n\noverall really good for lunch. im told lunch here is better than dinner. who knows. get gingerale!"

They were pretty packed, but service was still good. It's very pretty and romantic inside, so it's a nice place for a date or a bachelorette party. \n\nWe ordered the chicken milanese and the sausage pomodoro. Both dishes came out fairly quickly, and tasted wonderful! It's probably hard to go wrong with any of the dishes though.. everything smells really good! I also opted for the peach bellini, which was fruity, sweet, and totally did not have a hint of alcohol! \n\nThey also have a pretty good menu for happy hour on weekdays! :)"

As I entered the hostess at the stand asked me the basic seating questions once I informed her I was coming in for Happy Hour she changed her tone informed me that Happy Hour seating is at the bar or by the fire pit. \n\nAs I walked around LOST the employees just continued to watch me walk back and fourth. I was alone still waiting on my friend and you can clearly see it in my expression that I couldn't find a seat. I had to ask someone for help who then also told me to look on the other side where there is another fire pit. Ok I get it, it's Happy Hour and seating is first come first serve but what's the point of having guest walk in and out feeling lost when you can have some type of organization to it?\n\nFinally when I sat down it took about 10 minutes for someone to ask me what I wanted to drink and I guess they don't give you menus until you ask for one? This is the 4th time I have came here. It was my first time for Happy Hour and everytime I can't help but feel as if the staff be littles their guest. I clearly come back for the food and not the service! \n\nHappy Hour was definitely worth it! Great prices, good portions so as far as the quality in their food it's great! They need to work on better customer service skills. I have had better service at fast food restaurants then I've had here. It obviously wasn't a bad day for them cause 4 out of 4 tries the service just keeps getting worse."

Typically the service is always great but this past week it wasn't even busy and the service was awful to say the least.  \n\nBrio is the perfect spot for a date, celebration, or just a good meal.  They have reasonable prices and the food is always good.  \n\nI typically always get the sliced steak salad.  It's delicious.  I have gotten the lobster bisque a few times and it's overly salty and doesn't have almost any lobster meat in it.  \n\nMy friends have gotten several different dishes and always enjoy them.  This past time we had the beef carpaccio which is presented very nicely but it's definitely not the best I've ever had.  \n\nA huge plus to me is Brio's loyalty program.  Almost every time I dine here I have a $10 off on my card which is great!  If you don't bring your card they can easily look it up with your phone number as well!  How convenient!\n\nWhile i'll definitely be back I think they have a few things to improve their overall customer experience."

A few of these dishes will make for a perfectly good meal. The special is only good for the bar and it is first come, first serve. Since the weather is getting chillier, it is easy to get a seat on the outdoor side. They close the curtains and turn on heat lamps, so it is not bad.\n\nThe offerings consist of Beef Carpaccio, Spinach Artichoke Dip, two styles of Flatbread, Fried Raviolis (3 large pieces), a Burger (cut into quarters for sharing), Spicy Shrimp with Eggplant, and Shrimptini (Shrimp Cocktail). The carpaccio was my favorite and so inexpensive.The burger was also good. It is very simple, topped with cheese and a special sauce with a few chips. I usually like mine with all sorts of veggies, but this was nothing to frown upon. The raviolis were the last item I had ordered and they were decent. Getting three of these dishes makes for a perfect dinner and will cost less then $10. \n\nI looked at the rest of their regular menu and many of the pastas were cream based or had it as a listed ingredient. I like my pastas to be on the lighter side, so I tend to skip on them here."

            "review": "My most recent visit was not my first visit. Actually, it is among quite the few. Brio has been a pretty good go-to restaurant for a nice sit down dinner with a variety of meat or pasta choices. \n\nI was introduced to Brio about 5 years ago. And it has yet to completely fail me. Even with a recent experience of not mine, but two of my friend's Rack of Lamb order, they had messed up the temperature on the meat twice. One returned to the waiter, second time, even the manager and chef had come out. GREAT service and customer satisfaction. \n\nMy most recent visit was for a friend's graduation party. She had made reservations a day prior. Upon arrival, took maybe 10 minutes from arrival to having table ready. Not bad? Had came here for my b-day as well last august, and it took about the same amount of time for getting table ready. \n\nWe were seated in the back room (first time sitting in that room) in a 7 person round table. \n\nAt first, service was pretty good. Quick for drink orders and first round of bread came pretty fast. But went downhill from there. I had asked the waitress for more bread. My friend had asked another person for more bread. Because we had 7 people, the first round's two bread baskets disappeared fairly quick. Let's say, all our entrees came out, and was more than 1/2 way through it before one new basket of bread came out. Could easily say it was at least 30 minutes. This was just bread. If the bread is being baked or not ready, at least tell us ! The bread was good too ! first round of bread, nice and hot. i wanted more ! *sad face* \n\nI had ordered the Bistecca Alla Fiorentina (14 oz. Strip Steak served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables) - $28.45 - Seasoned well. Meat temperature was perfectly medium rare, like i had ordered. Mashed potatoes were creamy and rich. Roasted vegetables were... well... roasted vegetables. Lol. The one thing i dont understand about restaurants is why do they insist on using serrated steak knives? Not only do they rip through the meat, requires extra force to hold down the meat so it wont move while the serrated edge rips through..... Im not sure if its a safety thing or what... id much prefer a sharp non-serrated knife that allows me to cut through cleanly. Even if the meat quality is low and not cut through like butter, it still wont rip through... just make me make a few more passes before it cuts through.. personal little irk that bothers me i guess. \n\nOne of my friends had ordered the Brio Sliced Steak Salad (Mixed greens, tomatoes, Gorgonzola, mushrooms, candied pecans and creamy horseradish dressing, topped with grilled tenderloin and a balsamic glaze) - $15.95 - chopped greens topped with a tenderloin. Salad itself looked good and wonderfully dressed. The amount of meat she got was very little. I dont know if it really is a tenderloin but dang... i'd estimate the amount of meat that was there to be maybe 3 - 4 oz. For such a big salad, it was quite... tiny \n\nIn previous visits, i have tried the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca as well as the Roasted Lamb Chops. \n\nGorgonzola Crusted Bistecca - (Perfectly seasoned topped with Gorgonzola. Served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.) 8oz filet $29.95, 14oz strip $28.95 - essentially the same as the above listed Bistecca Alla Fiorentina but topped with a gorgonzola crust. Adds a nice flavor but the seasoning on the crust plus possible seasoning on the steak may double up and be a bit salty. \n\nRoasted Lamb Chops (Full rack, perfectly seasoned New Zealand lamb chops, with red wine veal sauce, mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus) - $29.45 - when done right, perfectly cooked and seasoned. tender and juicy. you get i believe 5-6 lamb chops. decent size. great for lamb lovers who may not want a steak. good alternative. \n\nOverall, despite the occassional lack of service, its still a favorite place to go among myself and some friends."

If you like Brio, I reccomend joining the MyBRIO REWARDS club.  You get a free meal on your birthday and various discount offers throughout the year.\n\nThis trip we came for lunch to try the new Lighter Side Menu.  About a 5 minute wait...not bad for lunch time.  Our server arrived right after we were seated for our drink order.  She was very attentive and super sweet.  I wish I remembered her name!  \n\nI had the 5 oz Filet Brio with asparagus, cubed sweet potatoes, spinach, and roasted red peppers.  $19.95 and 365 cals.  It definitely tasted better than 365 calories...and was more filling as well!  The filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare, juicy and savory.  The portion size was just enough to share a few bites with my friend without feeling like I needed more.  For some reason I was expecting mashed sweet potatoes, but they were tiny roasted cubes and were delicious.  The asparagus, spinach, and red peppers were also prepared superbly.  All the ingredients complemented each other and the meal was delightful.  I will definitely get this again.  The price point seemed a couple dollars too high for lunch, but the meat quality was very good, so I cannot complain.\n\nMy friend had the Shrimp Mediterranean, also from the Lighter Side Menu.  $14.95/ 470 cals. It came with orzo & farro pilaf, feta, broccoli, spinach, and asparagus.  She let me sample her dish; it was very tasty and something I would order if I was not super hungry.  I think mine was more filling because of my protein choice.\n\nAll in all, another good Brio meal!"

The girls and I usually order one of everything (don't judge) and justify all that food by telling ourselves it's ok because we're eating early aka during HH time.

However, since I can't and 4-star would be an injustice, this place gets a 5.\n\nBrio is easily one of the best restaurants I've been too in the past couple of years (tied with Hanks and miles ahead of Napa Valley win train). The food is exceptional! The service is impeccable! The decor is tr\u00e8s chic (love the high ceilings) and the staff is attentive.

The main dining room has high ceilings with white fabric billowing across, while the private dining area is separated in a replica/ re-construct of the colloseum. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ALWAYS order the  \"quattro\" bruschetta, which  allows the sampling of several varieties, including roasted red pepper and mozzarella and sliced steak with gorgonzola, arugula, fennel, tomato and Italian dressing. There is always one item of the quattro that change. \n\nA main salad that is a particular favorite of mine is the steak salad. The steak slices are prepared the same as the one used for the bruchetta. The dressing is incredible as well. I have also tried a chef special, which was a scallops with pasta. This may sound very generic, but the scallops were done so well that I now ask if they ever have it available. They do, however, have a great substitute, whichis the scallop and shrimp risotto. This platter is amazing. If you are drinking their chiantis or cabernet sav. it will help bring out the spice of the meal. \n\nI am a huge fan of desserts, and for me, Brio does not disappoint. One of my favorites is the panna cotta, which is served in small espresso cups filled with the panna cotta, and a small amount of shortcake at the bottom, drizzled with strawberry syrup.  I have also tried the tiramisu, which is great as well. And yes, I have had two servings of dessert during one meal  \n\nThe wine list is decently priced with a number of fine choices by the glass.\n\nAgain, one of my favorite places to go on a regular basis, but can be pricey to go that often."

Our food and drinks came out pretty fast. I was impressed and would definitely come back to check out their full menu"

It had a very soothing and settling environment.\n\nThe dishes were slightly large but enough to be finished. They also do half servings, which comes in handy for children or anyone with a small appetite like myself. I got the Lobster and Crab Ravioli and it made my taste buds jump!

The restaurant really has a nice feel and would be perfect if the staff were more attentive and the food faire was better thought out by the Chefs.  First, we were seated for 7 minutes before our server approached us.   Second, the temperature inside the restaurant was uncomfortably warm and stale.  Third, the meals.....My wife had the shrimp and lobster pasta.  We counted 6 small shrimp and mere flakes of what appeared to be lobster.  The sauce was good, but the pasta was the main attraction not the seafood.  I had the crab cakes.  They were just ok.  Two small crab cakes atop a mound of fingerling potatoes and green beans.  The main course was the potatoes.  \n\nThe olive oil and vinegar cruets were disgustingly sticky and I asked them to be replaced.  They were without hesitation by our server, but it's obvious they are infrequently cleaned which is concerning. \n\nWe had high expectations but were sadly disappointed.  We won't be back.  \n\nI got an private message and gave the Mgr my phone number many days ago. Never got a call.  So my recommendation has gone down to 2 stars."

I absolutely loved the lobster bisque, great texture with chunks of lobster in it. It went really well with the cracker-like bread that came in the bread basket, which was also fantastic. And I never like bread. The Mediterranean shrimp was good, and I was pleasantly surprised because I usually don't pair seafood with cheese. It was a nice light dinner and I was able to finish it without feeling too stuffed. Everyone else at the table ordered pasta and took home leftovers. My neighbor ordered pasta with sausage and it smelled great! \nI would go back for sure."

The heat in summer (and the cold in winter) makes much of the year unpleasant outdoors.  But in the spring and fall we can have some absolutely gorgeous days.  Last night was a beautiful warm spring evening.  It was not windy and the clouds overhead were spectacular.  This was the perfect time for dining al fresco and what better meal to have than something Italian.  A friend of ours who works at UNLV suggested this new restaurant in Town Square.  Although we have been to Town Square several times (and visit Fry's next door regularly), we had not tried this restaurant.\n\nWe were seated on the outdoor patio promptly and ordered the carpaccio which was recommended by our friend.  I'm glad we did as it was delicious.  I decided on the lobster risotto and my husband had the Veal Milanese both accompanied by a lovely Italian white wine.  There was plenty of lobster and asparagus in my risotto.  My husband's veal was tender with just enough capers and lemon butter to flavor it, but not to make it soggy.  I am not much of a dessert person, so we skipped it.  Sipping the last of our wine while the the sky grew dark was the perfect end to a beautiful day.  We will be back."

Luckily we arrived before the lunch rush at 11 AM, right when they open. We were seated in the expansive dining area at a large booth. The server arrived right away and took our order.\n\nBread service - comes with sliced white bread, kind of dry, and seasoned toast points. Olive oil/balsamic come along for the ride, as well as butter. OK.\n\nNext up - raspberry iced tea, incredibly sweet, obviously some sort of soft-drink style concoction, not great.\n\nMain entree: Pasta BRIO - \"Rigatoni, grilled chicken, seared mushrooms and roasted red pepper sauce\" - $14.85\n\nWhile pasta was well-cooked and sauce was delicious, chicken pieces had something to be desired. Mushrooms however were a nice addition, although I didn't get any hint of the searing, it seemed like they were just cooked in with the pasta. Overall, OK, but for the price kind of deflating.\n\nPrice points my party felt were a little out-there compared to the quality and quantity of the food we were served. \n\nCoffee service after the meal - a very strong brew accompanied by individual creamers for each person in the party (I liked that).\n\nService - good and on point.\n\nAtmosphere - Nice when we arrived, but as the dining room filled up it became VERY loud and it was hard to carry on a conversation, especially business-related since we didn't really want to yell into any other person's face over the noise.\n\nOverall - A-OK. Better than most chain Italian restaurants out there."

Speaking of service, I once slipped and fell as I entered the bar area. I was more embarrassed than hurt. In fact, I was fine. But the wait staff and a couple patrons rushed to my aide.

(I can't resist Lobster Bisque)  Brio's version was rich and creamy, with good lobster flavor.  I do like more large chunks of lobster meat in my bisque, though.  The bruschetta was a total winner.  There were 4 different types, which our server described as she set down the platter.  I loved the BLT bruschetta.  There was also a Roasted Pepper, and a Beef and Arugula.  They were all fabulous.\n\nOur entrees were:  A chicken and veggie pasta in a light cream sauce (Friend), a Chicken and Applewood Bacon Panini (the Boy), and Scallops with Arugula, Roasted Tomatoes, and Lemon sauce (Me).\n\nCould we be any different?  And yet, each entree was great.  The Scallops weren't overcooked.  (BIG Plus)  The pasta was huge, and the cream sauce wasn't cloying and heavy, and the Boy's panini was crusty, savory goodness.\n\nWe shared their dessert sampler (Photo) consisting of miniature cups of selected samples.  Tiramisu, Raspberry Cheesecake, Brownie Sundae, Blackberry Rhubarb Compote, and Apple Caramel Ala Mode.  HOLY YUM!!  (Tiramisu was rated the Best, followed in my opinion by the Blackberry Rhubarb Compote.)\n\nThe experience was awesome, the company was fabulous, and the food was great.

An old friend reached out to me the other day and suggested we do dinner, so we decided to visit this place last night.  \n\nThe place is dramatic.  There's linen draping the entire top of the inside.  The lighting is dim and super intimate.  Great place for a date!  Our server was cordial and didn't bother us much during our meal.  I appreciate very personable service and a lot of interaction, so it was a little quiet for my taste, but not bad to say the least.  \n\nTonight, we got a bottle of the Tavolo Matto (house brand) pinot grigio.  It was good enough for a house wine at $24 for the bottle.  I also go the sweet potato & chicken risotto for $17.65 which is a weird price.  One thing I can always count on Brio to deliver is an awesome risotto!  So creamy and perfect!  I LOVED the big chunks of sweet potato, asparagus and chicken.  Brio tends to change what they add into their risottos however, I don't mind.  Whatever they add, I know is always good.\n\nI don't tend to visit this place often because I consider it on the higher end of my budget.  I don't really think spending $30 a meal (including drinks) is spending my money effectively, however, it's a great place to visit once in a while.  Tonight was a special occasion and I'm convinced that Brio will be a great place to return to on another occasion!"

If I wasn't going to dinner with my family I probably wouldn't have come here. It is just too out of the way, especially if you don't have a car or you would rather go wild. This is not the place for you. The patrons who come here are mostly an older crowd or families, so this is not a party spot.\n\nThe food here isn't too bad. It isn't gourmet, but it isn't trash. We ended up ordering the Pasta Pesto (Angel hair, grilled chicken, caramelized onions, spinach, tomatoes, red peppers, Feta, basil, light pesto sauce) and the Fettuccine Rustica (Fresh egg pasta, spicy marinara, capers, basil, Kalamata olives, Parmesan). They were both just ok, nothing special. A little on the bland side.\n\nOverall, I would probably try this place again if I was in the area."

Walking in, the AC is so cold that I could see penguins.  We asked to be seated outside and were quickly seated.  We were quickly fogotten.\n\nAfter waiting for some time, a nice himsel man introduces himself and takes our drink order but never returns. This keeps happening over and over.  Finally we get someone and we ask for drinks before we order.  \n\nWe had to keep asking for the bread basket but they kept forgetting. The server didn't know the soup of the day.  Finally we ordered and our food came. The dressing on my Field Greens salad was too heavy on the vinegar and the salad was drenched to the point that the greens were soggy!  My soup got cold because no one brought me a spoon and I had to ask a couple times. No one brought me any crackers, offered pepper or cheese for the soup or salad, or my friends omlette.  Our drinks were often empty.  \n\nFortunately the manager walked by and we were able to share about our experience.  He was too kind and comped our meal, but I am quite reluctant to return to this location."

            "review": "I'll explain the lack of stars.. eventually.  \n\nSo, we arrived and were seated with only a short wait - and the waiting area had lots of very comfy seats so it wasn't much of an inconvenience at all.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, with the standard Tuscan paint scheme.\n\nOur servers arrived (one was apparently being trained).. though our waiter didn't introduce himself, the receipt said his name was Rhett so I'll just assume his trainee was Scarlett.  They were very friendly and helpful, and we ordered our meals.\n\nFirstly, our beverages and their bread selection arrived.. the bread was good.  Then our appetizer arrived, the Duetto Toscano Tuscan Dips.  I had a bit of each, thought they were both good but the Chorizo Fonduta was the best of the two.  Hubby, however, went nuts and cleared the rest of the platter... yes, he loved them both quite a lot.. though he gave extra points to the same dip.  The chilled Pepper Formagio was good, just needed something more.. not sure what.\n\nJust a note.. the over-attentive staff was incredibly prompt at grabbing empties off our table, keeping it clear.  Definite kudos to them for this.\n\nNow, for the entrees.. mine was the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto..absolutely fantastic.  The blend of flavors & textures was incredible, it was a delight.  Hubby's meal, the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca, got rave reviews from hubby though it was overcooked and had to be redone.  No, I didn't taste it.. gorgonzola is evil.  They put mine on a warmer for the duration or replaced it, I have no clue which it was.  He also got the Lobster Bisque which was probably one of the best I've ever tasted.\n\nHis side dishes, the mashed potatoes and vegetables, were not particularly noticable.\n\nNow, with the food being good, the service being fantastic, and the ambiance/decor being nice.. why only 3 stars?  Because it was COLD in there, to the point of teeth chattering, stuffed-up noses, shivering bodies.. and I was wearing jeans, a sweater, and sneakers.. clothing that should keep me warm enough in winter, let alone early September.  I only ate a few bites of my meal and had them package it up to bring home.. where I could actually enjoy the food instead of suffering through it.  And, though I complained many times (and they admitted that they were aware of the problem), nothing was done.\n\nAdditionally, the food was becoming rapidly chilled and cold risotto is not a good thing.\n\nPerhaps the rest of the food isn't that good and they want people to dull their tastebuds with stuffed-up sinuses?  I have no clue, but I know that I was beyond thrilled when we finally left.  And yes, I had even gone outside during the recooking phase just so I could thaw out a bit, only to have it all undone when I returned.\n\nSo.. it was good food, good service, but I doubt if I'll ever want to return there again.. not without Uggs, a parka, and a warming plate for the food.  Overall experience.. miserable."

I had made a reservation for 845 but had trouble finding it and arrived at 9p. I apologized to the hostesses who were [very welcoming]. I informed them it was my friends birthday and left her name with them. They sat me by the kitchen. I'm very impressed with the atmosphere and maintenance.\n\nMy waiter came over to greet me, I ordered a water with lemon. He forgot the lemons and said he would return with them. He returned, no lemons, asked if I would like an appetizer. I ordered an appetizer chopped salad. 30mins goes by and my friend arrived. He comes to greet her and take her drink order, I reminded him about my salad which he got promptly. The salad was excellent. Good portioned and lots of flavor for only 175 calories!\n\nWe order the light selection mahimahi and lemon chicken. The mahimahi was very good, fresh, not over cooked and well portioned. The lemon chicken was juicy but not over powering with a generous portion of veggies. Our compliments to the kitchen.\nI pushed my empty water glass to the end of the table and watched my waiter walk right by. I said excuse me. He came back. I asked for a refill and the manager.\nThe manager knew I STILL had not received my lemons, my salad took 30mins, and I was just overall not pleased with my service. She was very apologetic, got my friend a mini birthday desert, discounted our check, and took over our table herself.\n\nEven though it was a rocky first experience I would still come back and suggest this restaurant. I'm very impressed with the management and kitchen."

            "review": "This review is for Brio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, but frankly, considering how poorly happy hour went, I'm never coming back here to try their lunch or dinner. I wanted to try a new happy hour and had heard good things about Brio's food. I took my sister with me to try it out and off we went.\n\nAs soon as the first thing happened, I knew I should have just turned back around and tried another restaurant at Town Square. What happened? There were three employees up at the front of the restaurant chatting with each other and when we entered, I said two for happy hour. The guy said happy hour hour was on the patio and turned back to chatting with his fellow employees. I had never been to Brio before and wasn't sure how to get to the patio. Did he want me to go outside to gain access? Through the restaurant? His arm gesture wasn't too exact. So I asked how to get there, trying to subtly convey \"Could you walk us there?\" but nope. The guy just kept arm gesturing and said to sit out on the patio.\n\nFine. We walk through the restaurant and exit out a door to the patio. We see an empty table and sit down to wait for a waiter. Five minutes or so later, a harried waiter comes by and asks if we were seated by the front. I said no, we were here for happy hour and the guy up front just told us to sit out on the patio. Apparently the real tables were not meant for people during happy hour and that the couches by the fire pit was designated for happy hour. Uh, that was not mentioned, and this time I flat out asked if the waiter could show us this area. He did and I have to say, the area for happy hour sucked. The tables were made out of some flimsy material (some kind of flexible wood? I don't know) and the chairs/couches were terrible for eating on.\n\nThe waiter said he didn't know which waiter was going to serve us, but he would find out. I thought that was strange, but didn't think much of it. Again, another thing that should have made me just walk out with my sister and try another restaurant at Town Square instead. He came back and said he was our waiter and the entire time, he was just twitchy, like he didn't want to serve us. I guess it's because we were doing happy hour and by default, happy hour customers' bills won't be as high as someone just having dinner? Which is a stupid reason but one I kept leaning towards the longer we stayed at Brio.\n\nI ordered a vodka martini which reads on the menu \"Sobieski Vodka your way: Dirty or Dry with an Olive or Twist.\" When I ordered it, however, the waiter never gave me an option on how I wanted the martini. When it was served to me, I took a sip and nearly spat it out. It tasted terrible. If it wasn't for the fact that I paid for alcohol, I would have just set it aside, but I finished it because I paid for it and I wasn't going to waste it (but I definitely wasn't happy drinking something I didn't like).\n\nAs for happy hour food, we ordered tomato margherita flatbread, brio burger, and crispy cheese ravioli to share between us. The order took awhile to get to us and when it arrived, the burger was cold and the chips on top of it were stale. It was a dish I thought my sister would enjoy the most because it's a burger, but she refused to eat it after one bite. Instead she ate most of the ravioli. The flatbread was okay, just okay, but it's not something I'd want to pay for.\n\nAfter a disappointing meal and happy hour (sad hour), I asked the waiter as he passed by for the check. I wanted to leave and wash away this disappointment. It took him awhile to hand me my bill and then it took even longer for him to return with my credit card. At that point my disappointment slipped into frustration. Why the heck would a restaurant have a happy hour if they don't want to have a happy hour? Because that's how it felt like. The seating for happy hour was terrible, the staff was terrible, the customer service was certainly terrible, and whether they were short staffed or not, don't act like you don't want me there because I'm going for happy hour and not expensive dinner prices.\n\nBrio Tuscan Grille is one place I will never go to again and, frankly, I will always anti-recommend to people whenever possible. If I could give this place negative stars, I would."

When you walk into the restaurant, the hostess is always there with a smile and walking you to your table immediately. \n\nI really like the waiters here, because you can tell they're a team and they're always looking out for each other. Whenever it does get kind of busy, and our waiter is running around, another waiter from another section will come help us or tend to our needs. They always saying they're helping each other out, which is nice to see. At the other location in Town Square, other waiters are always ignoring us unless we're their table. \n\nThe lobster bisque is really good and not too fishy tasting. I personally like penne pasta with vodka sauce. They don't have it on the menu though - they have another type of noodle with cheese in it with the vodka sauce. I always ask for the penne vodka though, and they are always more than willing to accomodate and ask the chef for me. I always add shrimp too! Makes me feel like someone important because theyre doing something off the menu for me haha \n\nMy boyfriend has gotten a combination of some type of steak, lambchops, and several pastas, and they are always good!!\n\nWe always OD on bread so if youre hungry, you should ask for no bread...because once its on your table, its hard to ignore it!"

The answer given to me was since all food was hand/tray carried they only filled soup halfway. The problem with that is from the customer's perspective; it just feels like they are shorting you. Most if not all restaurants carry their food out on trays and my soup is always filled to satisfaction but not here."

I did appreciate the fact that they were very accommodating to our need for a speedy lunch. I had a flat bread pizza which was just fine. Tasted nothing like a true Neopolitan thin crust pizza, but its bastardized Italian food and for what it was it was just fine. If you're a fan of the OG this may be the place for you- plus they have a fantastic patio for outdoor dining."

The restaurant itself is beautiful and has indoor and outdoor seating as well as an indoor and outdoor bar.  Since Brio doesn't take reservations, you'll often have to wait a good 30-45 minutes which is plenty of time to get yourself is peach bellini (yes, it's girly and frothy) which is wonderfully refreshing and not too sweet.  The waiters are all very attentive, even when the place is slammed, which is a nice change from the LV norm.  \n\nFood wise: the bread you're served upon seating is piping hot and delicious; the lobster bisque is amazing; the brio chopped salad is great (but I recommend getting the balsamic dressing over the red wine); caprese bruschetta is delicious, as is the roasted red pepper brushetta (blanking on the name); and those mini desserts (creme brulee especially) are the perfect endings to a great meal."

For my entree I went with the pasta alla vodka and added shrimp it has a nice little spice to it and the pasta was cooked perfectly AL dente  my gf had a mixed seafood pasta dish that I tasted it was also very tasty. One thing I have to say as a downfall was that our waitress seemed to cater to the bigger tables and just check on us when she felt like it but we had a good table convo going so it wasn't that big of a deal. Prices were fair for the food we ate I see a lot of company's about that on here but this is vegas own your wallets people come on. All in all a very nice dining establishment and being in town square would be a really cute date spot for you lovebirds out there."

Our 3 year old had the kid's pepperoni pizza which was delicious and more than enough for him (and such a steal at that price point!)\nWe finished off with a free birthday dessert (thank you Brio for taking that extra step for us!), and the kiddo enjoyed his kid's ice cream sundae.\n\nOur server was wonderful, he was friendly, attentive (but not hovering), and made our dinner extra special.

Even when I relocated for three years, whenever I visit Vegas, I would always have dinner at least once at Brio. I would always suggest Brio as an option to my out of town friends. And more than once did we celebrate birthdays with dinner at Brio. \n\nHonestly, I've never really had a horrible experience at Brio. If we had any issues with our meals, once we bring it up with our server, they'd always manage to get it fixed right away. One of my most recent visits to Brio, our waitress was a blast -- we had a lot of fun kidding around with her. \n\nHowever, I am a little sadden by the fact that a few menu items have changed, such as the steaks. They no longer offer the surf and turf or just a filet mignon with veggies dishes. Though the steak dishes they have right now are still pretty good. I gotta say, the price you pay is a whole lot better than what you pay for if you eat at the strip. Brio has awesome prices (even though the prices have gotten bumped up within the past three years). \n\nIt can get loud while dining in though. There are tons of people talking, laughing, etc. But it never really bothered me. \n\nAs for what to get to eat at the Brio? I'd say try anything you want. Everything I've tried was very good. Some of my favorites are the steaks, rack of lambs, and the carbonara. I also enjoy their bruchetta a lot. One of my favorite drinks at the Brio has got to be their peach bellini -- it's always so yummy!!! Don't be afraid to try anything there :)"

My friend was buying and I did not want to make a scene with the waiter.  I had to soak it in salt and pepper to make it palatable. The waiter was fantastic so I can't blame him for the cook and manager. My wife gave me some of her lasagna and it was bland with no special seasoning or taste.  This place is always busy and there must be some good food on the menu. We drank water and had one appetizer.  Over $100 for 3 with tip no drinks.  Bad deal.  Don't let the atmosphere fool you.

I am not exaggerating! You heard it - world class! I simply did not expect this at all - it was that great!\n\nFrom the moment we walked around the beautiful exterior of the restaurant and sat in the waiting area and got to see the gorgeous interior of the restaurant I had a great feeling the experience would be great - but it actually excelled that expectation!\n\nWe were seated quickly even though we were told we would wait a bit longer. I could not help but look at the pretty earth toned surroundings while my BF and I chatted away. I had read that the risotto was great here so I looked for it on the menu but could not find it. Well, the waiter overheard that I was looking for the risotto and he said that he would see if they could make it for me anyway. WOW!!!! Double WOW actually, because he came back soon and said that they would make it for me! \n\nThe bread basket here is just great! They kept it coming too! They serve a thin crisp bread which is just divine!\n\nTheir iced tea is great and it kept coming too! We never had to ask for anything. The waiter was always looking to make our meal just perfect! You should have seen us drink it too! The hot desert night made us so thirsty!\n\nMy shrimp risotto with red pepper was a dream of a dish! The rice was just right and the creamy sauce was ever so tasty! The shrimp were fresh and cooked to perfection! I am not a big fan of any kind of pepper but they integrated the pepper into the dish ever so subtly and created just the right level of spiciness! It is like they read my mind! OMG!!!!\n\nMy BF had grilled shrimp, steak and chicken. It was soooo tender and juicy that I just wanted to cry tears of the utmost food ecstasy! It all had a really nice grilled taste to it too!\n\nThis place was recommended to us by a good friend of my BF and he really impressed me with his taste on this one! Thanks Pedro!\n\nParking is no issue since Brio Tuscan Grille is located in a large mall. There is outdoor seating as well. Great for people watching! Let no one fool you - this is no average Italian restaurant!"

With so many choices - Brio Tuscan Grille is a great place to get your grub on for cheap!\n\nTheir Tuscan Taster Menu is available in the bar area only and runs\nMonday through Friday: 3 pm to 6 pm\nSunday through Thursday: 9 pm to close\n\nAll nine of their mouthwatering items are only $2.95!!  What a steal!\n\n* Braised Meatballs & Creamy Polenta \"Topped with Marsala tomato sauce, Reggiano and parsley.\" - Three generous sized meatballs in a tasty and tangy sauce.  The polenta is a minimal amount the covers the bottom of the dish, but a nice touch.  The Husband really enjoyed this and was about to get another!\n\n* Beef Carpaccio \"Served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\" - Our favorite of the ones we tried, so we got two orders.  So good and tasty, and the field greens are a nice complement to the dish.\n\n* Margherita Flatbread \"Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil.\" - Very basic flatbread pizza, no fancy frills here.  A nice simple crunch.\n\n* Sliced Steak Bruschetta \"With Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmesan and Tuscan Italian dressing.\" - Four slices of bruschetta makes this a hearty dish with the cheese and beef.  Good flavors though and sauce adds a nice sweetness.\n\nUnfortunately, their happy hour only extends to the food so there are no drink specials.  (When I called, whomever answered said there were drink specials but it wasn't so when we sat down.)  \n\nThe bartenders took our food and drink orders, and the food came out promptly.  We had no issues with service as a result unlike the other reviewers.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place and we enjoyed ourselves here.  The dining room looks like a grand hall with all the drapery.  I suggest getting your grub on here and getting drunk somewhere else if you want to save a few bucks.\n\nUpdate! 07/15/09 - Went back again last Friday and finished off the entire Tuscan Tasters menu.\n\n* Brio Burger \"A quartet of BRIO's famous Bistecca Burgers, with smoked Mozzarella and housemade chips.\" - A very decent size burger for three bucks that was tasty and cut into four, perfect for sharing.  Chips were yummy too!\n\n* Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant \"Grilled shrimp with Romano crusted eggplant and a black pepper cream sauce.\" - A surprise goodie!  Came with eight shrimp/eggplant stacks and definitely would definitely order again.\n\n* Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread \"Fresh Mozzarella and housemade tomato sauce.\" - Good pizza where they aren't shy about the toppings.\n\n* Shrimptini \"Chilled shrimp served in a martini glass with roasted tomato cocktail sauce and fresh lemon.\"  Uneventful of the bunch, fine for simple shrimp but lacks any excitement.\n\n* Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta \"With fresh basil and balsamic drizzle.\" - Tasty bread bites with four pieces of bruschetta.\n\nThis time we went with a group of four and ordered one of everything.  It pretty much filled us for the most part, although if you're hungry, just double up on the burgers and meatballs.  We grabbed a little table this time in the bar area inside and our waitress was fine again.  It took a bit of time to get the table cleared and for the orders to go in, but nothing to complain about.  \n\nOverall, they did well again for filling our tummies on a budget!"

The decor is actually really nice.  It's more of a nice date place.  They've got a really nice faux Colisseum exhibited in the dining area.  A very nice touch to the restaurant.  \n\nI ended up orderering the Pasta Fra Diavolo with chicken.  I thought it was ok.  It didn't really pack the kind of flavor that I was really looking for.  Usually the sauces are exuberant for this type of dish, but this one was a little on the bland side.  The chicken was also forgettable, not really adding much to the dish.\n\nWould I come back to this place?  I'd probably give it another shot and try something else.

The pastas on the other hand were so overly seasoned, greasy, and so salty that they were gross. That kind of scared me off from trying their food again. NOW! Their bar is another story. Love it. They have an absolutely gorgeous patio with canvas curtains, string lights, and comfy chairs. They have this raspberry mojito that is so delicious that I get one every time I go there. It's romantic and intimate. The staff are excellent, I have never had anything less than perfect service when i've gone there. It's a more mature crowd and probably one of my favorite places to go on a date. I would try the food again, because it is possible I just had a few bad experiences. But the ambiance, the drinks, the service, and the location is what keeps making me come back for more."

Yum!\n\nCaprese just like I had in Sicily...fresh tomato and greens with buffalo mozzarella, olive oil, and balsamic with the perfect amount of S&P.  \n\nAmazing service-everyone was smiling and very friendly, nice hostess, great waitress, love the kids menu which offers healthy alternative like salmon, broccoli and mashed potato's one of the reasons we come here...it's my child's favorite!\n\nFour Seasons Service!\n\nI will be back!"

I had the Chicken Limone which came with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies (zucchini, carrots, broccoli). It was a MASSIVE portion. It was delightful. I had moscato to drink and as a non-wine person, also delightful. The appetizer was the parmesan flatbread with artichoke dip. It was yummy. The Caesar salad was on the sad side, but the rest of the meal made up for it. I have no idea if the cake we had was by Brio or if it was brought in, but it was also wonderful. \n\nIf I was spending the day at the mall here, I would definitely stop by for dinner on my own dime."

            "review": "Second time dining at this place, first time was a hit and this time was no different. First thing, I noticed about this place is the layout. High, High Ceilings and the Overall decor looks so Grand, Open and Romanesque. Like its decorated for a Wedding Reception or Event of some sort.\n\nWe were greeted with smiles and quickly seated. Our hostess, immediately gathered and picked up the extra table settings in Lightning Speed and then handed our menus. WOHO! No more than 30 seconds our Server comes over and hands us the menu with a big smile and takes our drink orders. No more than a minute, a food runner brings us our drinks. A few minutes later, Our server politely comes by and asks us if we were ready to order and this is what we got:\n\n\"Primi\" (Appetizers):\n\nCalamari Fritto Misto: Big plate (easily shared by 3-4 people)! I loved the peperoncini mixed with the squid. Once in a while I would pick one up to spice it up a bit! Or sometimes it was a spicy surprise! Breading wasn't real golden brown and crispy. Came with 2 sauces on each side -Red sauce/Marinara type and Yellow sauce/Garlic Aioli. Red sauce typical pasta pizza sauce flavored. On the other hand, the Garlic Aioli was Absolutely Divine!! I don't know if its just me but that flavor got my attention real quick! It had a distinct flavor and a hint of horseradish mustard something that I couldn't get enough of! I didn't want to look like a dog but I would of Licked that plate clean with a shine! \n\nSpicy shrimp & Eggplant: Nice presentation, came on a long rectangle plate all lined up like in a straight line. Overall, flavor wasn't really impressive more disappointing if anything. The black pepper cream sauce wasn't as good as it sounded but the romano crusted egg plant was nice. Basically, after a few pieces, I was over it.. I guess that's why its an appetizer! But this felt heavy and after a few, I threw in the towel..\n\nEntree:\n\nPasta Pomodoro with Chicken and added their Bistecca Insalata (salad): Another Heavy Weight plate, a generous mound of angel hair pasta, grilled chicken, pine nuts and their cilantro pesto drizzle. Plus some grated parmesan on top. Pretty straight forward dish and pretty good as well. It was just lacking 5 Stardom calibur, just like every other dish.. (Except for the salad, I'll get to that!).\n\n*Bistecca Insalata: The Freshest Wedge of Iceberg Lettuce (crisp and almost neon green), Gorgonzola, real pieces of bacon (not dried bits), shiny red roma tomaotes and their mouthwatering creamy parmesan dressing!! One of the Best salads I've ever sunk my teeth in!!\n\nCouldn't help but watch some of the staff really get to work. During our meal, we couldn't help but notice a vacant table behind us that was getting set for the next guest(s). The busser/server assistant was so precise and jaw dropping fast! I mean like watching a dvd and pressing forward like 3 times/3 arrows!! Just like everybody else here!! It's like the In N' Out Burger staff on a Redbull High!!! Also, I must mention our (Pregnant) Server did not skip a beat from refilling drinks, stopping by to check on the dinner status, to adding the extra Garlic Aioli sauces in our staff wrapped doggie bags! Service 5.5 Screaming Stars! Taste of Food 3.5-4 Stars (Bistecca salad 5+ stars), Value for amount of food 4-4.5 Stars and Ambiance 4.5 Stars.."

Not happy with that at all. \n\nThe only explanation we were given was that they were running behind because it was Valentine's Day! Well obviously that's why I made a reservation. Maybe you shouldn't double book your reservations so you can seat people that expect to be seated on their specified time.\n\nDisappointed!!!"

On Monday a friend of mine and I decided to eat here after some shopping. There was no wait and we had the pleasure of being seated in Amanda's section who was an absolute delight!! I could not have asked for a better server or better service! She was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, engaged in some wonderful conversation and even joked with us when appropriate. \n\nWe started with the amazing Bruschetta Sampler which Amanda recommended, perfect choice! My friend went with some sort of pasta and I chose the lamb chops with Maple Balsamic Brussels Sprouts. \n\nAfter the food was delivered, Amanda checked up on us to ensure everything was great. I actually finally was able to convince my friend to try lamb for the first time. She actually loved it  and we expressed that to Amanda. After a couple of minutes Will, some sort of manager came over and asked if everything was ok, we confirmed that it was and he continued on his way. After I finished the first lamb chop, I took a break to show my friend something on my phone when we were rudely interrupted by Will, the manager. He immediately asked if we wanted boxes. We hadn't even had our main dish for longer than 10 minutes and I told him that I was not finished and I was still working on it. He then said he would go get the check, he returned a few minutes later and said \"No rush!\"  I was kind of confused because there wasn't a wait for seats and there were several tables that had been at their enjoying their dinner longer than we were even in the restaurant. \n\nAmanda came over and even was confused on why he was bothering us, we explained that we felt that we were being kicked out and were not even offered the dessert menu which we were actually going to order, but since we were made to feel unwelcome we would just pay and leave. Amanda decided to get another manager to come over and apologize for the experience. Jenna came over and apologized and offered free dessert but our experience was already ruined and since we were made to feel like we were not wanted we just wanted to leave. \n\nWe paid the tab and decided to leave. Again I cannot tell you how amazing Amanda was, Jenna was very sympathetic and tried everything change our experience. \n\nHonestly, Will should not be allowed to work with the public. I do understand why we were basically told to leave before I was able to even taste my side dish.  I definitely will not be back at this location!\n\nI forgot to mention that after this was posted, I did receive gift card in the mail as a way to make peace, but also a personal phone call from Will informing me that he was bothered that someone would feel this was about him, he apologized profusely and even offered to buy me drinks, i kind of feel weird that they gave him my number and he kept me on the phone for a good 30-45 minutes trying to win my approval. It was strangely uncomfortable but at the same time nice to be able to tell someone they were the reason for a low review, just weird he has my cell phone number."

I have been planning my Vegas wedding since February and was having a hard time finding a place that was elegant with excellent food without breaking the bank. Nova is the banquet manager there and he was truly amazing. He addressed my one million emails prior to the dinner and was a true advocate for helping me have an outstanding dinner even when I lived in another state. It was stressful being so far away but Nova made it easy for me. \n\nLet's start with the food. I had visited the restaurant before I signed a contract to try the food. The chicken milanese was great but the real highlights were the filet  and also the pasta with vodka sauce. The pasta was handmade and to die for. We were also served two types of salad and potatoes/veggies. Everything was great but my wedding group raved about the filet for days. Who would have thought you could get such a great steak at an Italian restaurant. \n\nThe service was great. Tamara was fun and very concerned about making sure I was a happy bride. I paid for a bar package and was not disappointed. The staff was very attentive and took multiple drink orders. I definitely felt that we got more than what we paid for. The servers also cut and served our cake that we had ordered. \n\nOverall it was a fantastic experience and I am sure that we will go back each time we visit  Vegas to relive the memory. Thank you so much Nova and Brio Tuscan for making my wedding so memorable."

And the wine they brought over was a perfect pairing.  My friend who was with me did not like her breaded chicken dish at all and tried to swallow it down.  I let the waiter know since she was unwilling to speak up but she didn't know what else she wanted.  He said, \"Do you trust me\" and she affirmed.  \"He said, I've got just the thing for you and you won't be disappointed.\" And she wasn't.  The mini desserts in little Turkish coffee size cups (e.g. Tiramisu, Creme Brulee) etc were perfect for those who don't have any more room for the Big Boy Size confections but could slide in a bite or three amidst the now expanding pasta in one's stomach.  We finished the meal outside taking in the great Vegas weather and the delightful ambience that is Town Square.  I've been there before, I'll go there again.  I'm a fan."

Once we sat down, we were greeted by our server who immediately asked what we wanted for drinks.  Although it wasn't listed on the menu, they offer a carafe of mimosas.  When we asked the server about it, she wasn't sure if they do that and had to go and check if that was possible.  The server returned saying that it was possible and she told us that it would be $18.  We felt like that was a better deal amongst the 2 of us.  One glass of mimosa was already $6.  The carafe ended up being 2 and a half glasses each! \n\nI ordered the open faced chicken avocado omelet and my friend ordered the ravioli di bello. Since we came for brunch, I decided on a brunch dish, but was also interested in the ravioli.  My friend beat me to it!

I will also never come back or recommend Brio's to my friends. This is a customer service town with a lot of choices, first impression counts when it comes to where I spend my money."

Since our group was smaller in size, we opted for the public outdoor patio which was very nice.  They also let us bring in our own desserts to celebrate her.\n\nOur food was great which included an aritchoke dip appetizer and then I had their Citrus Green Salad which was really flavorful.\n\nThe service was excellent.  Crystal was our catering coordinator who was great to work with leading up to the event.  Michael, the manager, was also super friendly.  Our day-of server (I can't remember his name sadly) was also great to us and very patient allowing us to occupy the table for a long time.  \n\nWould definitely go back there the next time I am in the Vegas/Henderson area."

The desserts are smal enough to be crazy, except the cheesecake, but if you're prdering cheesecake calories may not be your focus. heh\n We had two great servers, and were checked on often, but my daughters coffee never got refilled. There was a chari in a sitting near us LEAKING. Dripping onto the floor. No one knew why and the servers stared at for a long time after I pointed it out, but no one cleaned it up.....? Really?"

I normally visit during their happy hour (M-F, 4pm to 6pm) when their prices and portions are quite generous. Here is my happy hour breakdown.\n\nAmbiance: High energy and BUSY!! Their bar area is spacious but plan on waiting for a table if you are not there right at 4pm. \n\nService: Fast and friendly... The way it should be! \n\nFood: AMAZING! Their $3.95 dishes are tasty and come in large portions. Do not leave their happy hour without trying their burger or the shrimp and eggplant dish... You will be sure to love them!\n\nDrinks: The mojitos and sangrias are awesomely refreshing... Depending on the bartender. I wish they were more consistent with their flavor profile and alcohol content of their cocktails. In fact, their drink unpredictability is why I give them 4 stars. \n\nI will most definitely visit again and again!"

Don't they have tons of great restaurants out in the City of Gluttony?   True that... But!  Remember!  This is also home to endless scrumptious buffets as well!  How can I let that slide right?  Ok... so I ended up at a restaurant this time around... Buffets I'll see you on my next trip.\n\nStopped by this hidden shopping plaza near the South end of the strip... Yes!  There is one real nice shopping mall and it's not an outlet!  (Town Square)  This plaza is totally nice and especially during the winter time coz it's got such a cozy feel to it... since we were looking for food, we came, we searched, and we landed at Brio Tuscan Grille.\n\nInitially I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I'm glad that I was wrong.  Let me tell you why this is definitely a place that I'd go back again...\n\nD\u00e9cor:  Awesome!  Interior design at this place rivals those at the Grand Lux caf\u00e9 except much fancier!  Dim, beautiful lighting, and awesome outdoor patio with a fire pit for a nice little gathering should you have a large party.\n\nFood was actually more tastier than I was expecting...  Here were just the few that I've sampled\n\n-Calamari:  Flash fried to perfection with aioli dipping sauce, yum!\n-Penne Gorgonzola:   Off the hook good with just the right amount of sauce\n-Fettuccine Rustica:  Just ok... not enough sauce for my taste\n-Chipotle Chicken and Bacon Panini:  One of the best sandwiches I've had!  The bread was toasted beyond perfection to a point that it is crispy yet chewy!!! Not sure how that happened but I really need to try more paninis and see if they all taste this good!  Then the chipotle flavor coupled with load of chicken was just awesome!  (Yes, this was my dish!)\n\nService was wonderful too!  Water was always filled to the rim without requesting them to come by to do so, and they also allow dogs to be right by the gate so our buddies can share some food with us!  (not inside but at least near us)\n\nPrice:  Very reasonable!  Majority of the dishes for lunch runs no more than $15 and good portions too!\n\nIf you are in the Sin City and craving Italian, do help your wallet a favor by giving this place a visit instead of some fancy Italian joint inside the casino... you won't regret it!"

It felt back home for a while.We sat in the gazibo room, the  lites were nice and dimm, and the atmosphere was great. Sandy was our waitress and she was very polite and spirited. Her recomendations were awsome, the ceaser salads that came out were fresh and the lettuce crisp the lobster bisqe was good too.The basket with the bread that came out was nice and hot. As soon as they  saw our table empty with bread they kept on coming with more, and they always refilled our drinks as well. The pasta dishes with ricotta panceta in a vodka cream sause excellent (Pasta a la Vodka),the brazed beef with cremini mushrooms and homade noodles was great, the flavors were all there, awsome!! The mohitos are a little on the lite side, but it was corected from Sandy.The deserts that came out in little espreso cups [2.50 each] Smart!! Very good idea you can try them all. In general the experience was great and we will be back. For a chain restaurant to look that good and please their customers so well, gets 5 stars from me. PPERRRFFECCTOOOOOOOOOO!"

I would give 5 starts if the salmon salad I had was better. The salmon portion was delicious. However, the salad portion needs some changes... for one, the asparagus still has its stalks and therefore you had to spit out chunks of the end instead of being able to consume it whole. The salad was also a bit mushy... I'm not sure how to change this, but if it can be done, I would highly recommend it. And lastly, the forks can use an upgrading. I was thankful to have an extra fork to use when the first one felt as though the prongs were bent in different ways... unfortunately, the second was similar in fashion although not as severe. \nThat being said, the atmosphere was great! We'll be back and I'd love to try a different dish."

For me the best item on the menu is pasta alla vodka, which is handmade ricotta filled pasta with pancetta, garlic and basil in a spicy tomato Parmesan cream sauce. It is my favorite pasta all times and could eat it almost each time I visit the place and never get bored with it. I usually enjoy tasting various items from the menu in other restaurants, but pasta alla vodka is simply delicious and could never get enough of it. The only problem is that the dinner portion is exactly the same size that lunch portion, but more expensive... Slightly disappointing. \nAnd obviously I did try other dishes from their menu as well and all of them have nice fragrant flavors. So overall good food with solid service!"

It was very loud in the restaurant because of the openness of the space (it's very spacious for seating and the bar area) but I was able to find my group very easily and interact without much trouble.\n\nThe wine, appetizers, salads, bread and soup were all excellent.  The choice in breads was nicely done to not bore you with a simple roll.  The entree's were classic italian faire, however I ordered a steak (not in the mood for lasagna or something pasta).  It was cooked wonderfully; I wasn't the only one to order the steak...all enjoyed theirs, too.\n\nDesserts were served in a type of large shot glass with flavors such as Creme Brulee and Tiramisu, among others.  I loved scooping into the tiramisu and finding a different flavor every scoop.\n\nIt was a little pricey for my taste; since I was part of a group and the company was footing the bill, I was more than happy to attend.  I would come here only if I wasn't paying.  If I were tasked with taking care of the check, I could find quieter, more intimate places to get the most bang for my buck."

            "review": "I have dined with Brio Tuscan Grill in the past, but this time felt compelled to review.\n\nI arrived at Brio Tuscan Grille  just before noon on a Friday and to my surprise did not wait to be seated - the restaurant, albeit busy, provided immediate space.  The restaurant is that of a large, open floor, high ceiling dining space.  The \"Tuscan\" d\u00e9cor is immediately apparent and the high ceiling with streaming tapestry is a nice touch.  Regretfully I felt as though I spent the entire meal yelling at my colleague as the roar of the patrons is stifling.  The dining room rumbles with dialogue from the tables, each seemingly attempting to talk louder than the next.  This may be the result of the large dome-like space.\n\nThe team serving us was friendly, not unlike the hosts, but did unfortunately need to be reminded of extra table flatware, indications for drink refills, and simple things like a spoon to stir my coffee, however, negating these oversights with accommodating pleasant demeanor.\n\nI cannot speak on my friend, but I ordered the Mezza Chicken Limone and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys characteristic chicken.  Aside from the elegant name, this lunch fare is simply Lemon Chicken with Campanelle Florentine.  The chicken was flavorful, with lemon obvious with each bite, and the bed of greens accented the capers nicely; the portion size is perfect for a healthy lunch as well.  I would also like to note the Campanelle Florentine was just a bit overcooked, but not enough for most to notice.  Again, I recommend the Mezza Chicken Limone and Brio Tuscan Grille to all - we'll see how things are next time: at dinner."

I've been coming here for about 4 years since its in a great central location.  It's easy to get people to meet here since its central to Summerlin and Henderson.  \n\nThere is outdoor dining as well as inside dining.  You can only get Happy Hour in the Bar/Lounge area and it is first come first serve for seating. It can get busy especially when the weather is nice so try to get here early especially if you have a decent size group. The outdoor area has fire pits set up as well which is perfect at night when it can get a little chilly.\n\nHappy Hour is $4-$6 small plates and certain drinks.  The sangria is pretty good along with the martini (order it dirty and add Blue Cheese olives for a little extra!).  The beef carpaccio is delicious but not very filling so order a few if you have a decent size.  Some of my other favorites are the eggplant fries, and the black pepper shrimp with eggplant.\n\nThe problem with happy hour is either the bar staff isn't properly equipped or they are just too aloof to actually give good service. Every time we have to wave down our server for silverware, napkins, to put in additional orders, or to let him/her we are ready to pay.  On one specific occasion we tried to get the bartenders attention for 20 minutes to place more drink orders and he ignored us.  Finally as happy hour was ending he said sorry happy hour is over. Thats not good customer service in my opinion as I know he saw us trying to get his attention since we were sitting directly in front of him.\n\nI have also come for brunch and the service was still a miss. We split the Tuscan omelette and the berries and cream French toast. Everything tasted pretty good.\n\nOver all tasty Italian inspired cuisine for a good price with aloof service from staff members who would do well with a little customer service training."

I also pointed out that the hair was greasy and she cleaned that up, but never bothered to do anything about the hair on the table. The plates on the table (for the bread) had so much water that when my friend put her bread on one of them, it got soggy.

While I don't usually like to eat at \"chain\" restaurants, this has been my saving grace for informal lunch meetings, dinners with unadventurous eaters, and satisfying a group of people with various dietary preferences (low carb, low fat, gluten free, vegetarian).  \n\nI highly recommend making reservations for the evening when you have a party of 6 or more, but for lunch I usually have to wait 10-15 minutes.  They give you a pager and you have the freedom to occupy your wait time with shopping in nearby stores.  Once inside, the setting is a pleasing \"Tuscan\" style and the energy/noise level is bustling, but usually I like to sit outside because I usually have my nicely behaved dogs with me. They require I tie my dogs to the outside of the restaurant fence and sit at a nearby table,but I have seen dogs sit on their laps with their owners.  This discrepancy kind of bothers me, because my dogs are well behaved, but like to sit at our feet...many don't notice them but if they do it is because they are cute and well behaved.\n\nUsually I order a flatbread and bruschetta for the table as an appetizer. I usually order the steak salad for lunch, which is phenominal, especially since most places end up making the meat well done or not using a tender meat. The pasta is decent here, at least I never heard my guests complain and usually give raves.   The portions are generous for the price, and usually lasting me two meals.  I have had the steak and vegetables for dinner, which was prepared and cooked nicely. Service is always polite, but sometimes a little slow when it is busy. Again the food is no culinary feat, but it is solid and unoffensive.  While not unique, no one is going to complain and your guests will definitely think it is solid food and come out satisfied and full.  \n\nAgain a great place where everyone can find something they like and enjoy themselves in a casual, relaxed Italian style.\n\nOne other comment, I think they have done a great job with their wine menu. By the glass, plenty of unique and affordable wines covering a range of varietals both whites and reds, but also many familiar, easy drinking wines.  Further, many \"gem\" bottle that are well priced...about 175% markup rather than the 200%+ markups...that can mean atleast $10 -20 savings per bottle."

It was 9:30 at night, we didn't want to spend $32 a plate on the strip, and so we decided to give long passed-by Brio a try.\n\nThe verdict; upscale olive garden that knows what Al Dente means. So 3 stars at least for that. We had hoped to sit outside, but after putting our names in for a table, got so quickly ushered to a seat next to the miniature Colosseum replica (?!...Why would you build that?!) that we sort of gave up on asking.  Very much has the same \"upscale chain that doesn't want to be considered a chain\" vibe as a Yardhouse or a McCormick and Shmick's. \n\nThere was absolutely nothing wrong with the food. We had a calamari appetizer, 2 basil gimlets, a lemonade, 3 pasta dishes and a salad. We might have all been really hungry, but we also finished everything, and then nibbled at some of the crumbs. I actually wish they would have offered a refill on the bread, as my jerk tablemates ate all the french, and left me the crackers, but this offer was not forthcoming. That was sort of the modus opperandi. Nothing extra or surprising or special, no extras extended. You get what you ask for, you pay for what you ask for. Nothing wrong with that, just nothing to get super excited about, either. \n\nI had the sausage and tomato pasta, which was good; the pasta actually had flavor and texture, which I had hoped for but not expected. The tomatoes were actually fresh and the fennel sausage a bit on the dry side, but crispy and very flavorful. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed it. I just doubt I'll remember anything about it a month from now. \n\nBrio seems like a very safe bet; I'm sure if I went back in 6 months I would have a very similar experience. It would be a great place to take my utterly unadventurous friends and relatives when they visit from out of town. If I was still doing the dating thing and on a blind date, had to do a working lunch, or meet an estranged relative I knew nothing about, this might be a good place to avoid judgments."

Then he did bring our iced tea - after we asked three times - with no lemon, no straws. Just clueless! I asked for a manager and requested a new server, who is doing better but we shouldn't have to get a manager's assistance to get drinks. The manager has been very gracious. As for the food?

Maybe starting someone new on the Saturday of a holiday weekend isn't the best idea. Just a thought.\n\nUpdate: We never got our appetizer salads. Frankly, I don't think the server ever submitted our order. Then my brother's order of stuffed pasta with vodka sauce  came out cold. We had to ask three times for olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

The angel hair pasta was cooked perfectly, not too soft, not too hard.  The salmon was a a tad bit more cooked than I would have liked, but because there was a nice scampi butter sauce, it was still delicious.\n\nI will definitely return to try their items on the happy hour menu."

Besides delicious dishes, such as beef carpaccio and spicy shrimp and eggplant in a delicious spicy sauce, we also feasted on crispy shrimp served on a delicious bed of greens.  The Brio burger is still a must have order, for sure.  I must say that it is definitely worth your time, and you owe it to your tastebuds, to enjoy The Brio Restaurant and all it has to offer.

There are times when I have been here where the food and the service is just not up to par and the last time I was here, was not any different. \n   I brought my sister here for her birthday dinner. We decided to sit outside since they had the misters outside turned on to cool things down a bit. We didn't order any appetizers but we decided to get drinks. The peach and raspberry sangria with moscato in it not only looked good but it was very refreshing. My sister ordered the shrimp risotto and I ordered the angel hair pasta with pesto sauce and shrimp. The risotto dish seemed fine, each dish had jumbo shrimp in it but my pasta was dry and had little to no sauce on it.  \n   In the middle of our dinner, the restaurant decided to turn the misters off, even though it was only 7:30. At that point, it just got too hot and uncomfortable to even enjoy our meal. We were just ready to go but our waiter seemed really busy so we just sat out there in heat waiting for him to come by with our check. \n    May be next time I come here, I will sit inside so I am not melting in the heat and can try to enjoy my meal."

You receive warm bread that's freshly baked. Their lasagna was super rich but you could definitely taste all the cheeses and meat. The Filetto Di Manzo Toscano steak is always cooked perfectly! I have never had a steak cooked and done so well! We also asked for the grilled salmon which was just as delicious. All the plates came warm and in big portions. I recommend the peach sangria!

I am not a huge fan but agreed to meet since it was her birthday. My other friend and I arrived first and scored a nice table outside as the weather was perfect. Our two friends arrived shortly after us and we all got comfortable. I just wanted to have a light lunch so I chose the Strawberry Chicken salad. My friend chose the Chicken Limone. My salad was better than expected with good flavor from the spicy pecans and the goat cheese. We also enjoyed really good service. Our server was always there filling up our water and tea. She was kind enough to take a couple of pictures for us too which I know can be a pain when one has several other tables to take care of. I have been to both Brio's here in town and I would have to say that I like the one at Town Square over the one at Tivoli Village. The atmosphere and the outdoor patio dining at Town Square is much nicer then having to inhale exhaust from the cars that are driving through Tivoli Village. I do like Brio's happy hour too during the summer as they offer some great drink specials at decent prices. This was an afternoon of good times with good friends to celebrate Buon Compleanno!"

Good food, lets get things straight I keep going back because of the food location and people watching, the service is at best mediocre and at worst it just plain sucks.\n\nFlatbread - quite good\nFish specials - Good (usually go for this at lunch)\nChicken under a brick - bad should be left under the brick and kicked to the curb\nPizza - good (if you like thin crust stuff, i prefer just going to the flatbreads though)\nLamb - I like pink lamb I have had to send back as ultra rare lamb is not to my taste, beef yes lamb ultra rare no\nDeserts are good I link the sampler (see service below)\n\ni like the ambiance of this place for sitting outside and people watching, there arent enough decent al fresco dining places in vegas (because it gets hot) however it is too big.  Been there a lot and have never been remembered because i rarely have seen the same server twice.\n\nWait staff seems to be overworked and under-crewed so I never take it out on my servers (tip wise), however I have had to complain about wait times and am usually rewarded with free desert to the table which i usually get the sampler which is quite tasty and varied the apple crumble is very good.\n\nPrice to food quality is a very good ratio. Overall it is a decent restaurant,  if you are tight on time, it would be  a no go.  However for extended lunches (booze helps deal with longer wait times) it is a go to place.  Just if the service is slow dont be scared to notify people you are waiting and furthermore dont hesitate to take it out on the manager and not the overworked servers who are really trying their best with what looks like understaffing decisions.\n\nOverall a 3 star would be 4 if their service gets a revamp."

Keep in mind, I'm a bit biased because typically I frequent Brio during happy hour.\n\nFirst, let's talk about Happy Hour. A plenitful variety of appetizers (including a full size burger) for $2.95.  Budget friendly?  That would be a yes.  I've also eaten at their sister company Bravos quite a few times, and everything I ever had off the menu was AMAZING.  \n\nBut good food only gets you so far with me.  What's an instant ratings killer?  Oh right, Bad service. \n\nNow granted, I eat at Brio quite a bit because it happens to be located near my place of employment, so because of that I tend to frequent their Happy Hour specials on my lunch hour.  Just the food portion though.  Drinking during my lunch would be a little more than frowned upon.  \n\nSo I'm not sure if it's because I typically dine alone, or they know I work in the vicinity of the restaurant, or it's because I never consume alcoholic beverage in the bar area when I'm on my lunch, but the service has gone from decent to mediocre to abysmal.\n\nMy review is based on my previous visit.  So I'm sitting at the bar during happy hour and it's actually quite a slow day, meaning lots of empty bar stools.  I come in, sit down, and no exactly what I want.  The gentleman beside me gets his food right as I'm sitting down and apparently knows the one of the many...I think at one point I counted 5 people working behind the bar.....bartenders.  She inquires about his food, glances at me....and WALKS AWAY.  Ok, maybe she was distracted.  5 minutes later- no one has even acknowledged my presence, let alone taken my order.  So I sit patiently wondering what the deal is when one of the bartenders notices I haven't been waited on and asks how she can help me.  Afraid that no one is going to come in my direction again, I place my food and drink order all once.  Meanwhile, the guy to my left is displeased with one of his dishes and gets it removed from his bill.\n\nSo my food comes, it's tasty as always, but water at this point is empty.  After being finished with my food for well over 5 minutes, the bartender from before comes over...glances right at my empty water glass... and asks if I'm ready for the check.  \n\nSo let's briefly discuss the number one way to piss me off at a restaurant- oh that's right, an empty drink.\n\nSo at this point, I pay my tab and bolt.  And haven't been back since."

It's wise to make a reservation first.\n\nFood/Drinks : The menu offers a wide array of choices. The food is very tasty. The drinks are yummy.  It's hard to choose which one to get!   We really enjoy the breads they bring to the table prior to the meal. The multi-grain/cheddar flat bread  is a must try. I like that they bring a display of the desserts they offer to your table at the end of the meal. \n\nService: The staff goes out of their way to make your experience inviting. Very friendly!\n\nAmbiance: Wow! Very nicely decorated . The dim lighting is nice at night. It gets a bit loud at times. Plenty of seating.\n\nLocation: EXCELLENT!!  Town Square is an awesome place to shop at before/after."

We knew something was wrong when the hostess told the other hostess to sit us outside and she said, \" uhh you sure him?\" hah.The food was still amazing. Just the fact that it took them forever to bring us our wine at first & when we asked for the check ( From someone that wasn't our server, 'cause OUR server disappeared on us) it took longer as if we were waiting for more food!\n\nWe went to have brunch just this sunday and had a great time. I got the Eggs Oscar & he got the Chicken & Chorizo Benny. Add some coffee to the mix, Perfect. Server was awesome ( tall guy). \n\n\nAll in all, we love this place & our last visit just solidifies why we always come back."

We waited a long time for our food to arrive.  Turns out the reason for that...everything came out at once!  The server that brought out our food, put down the food and gave me a dirty plate with his thumb smudged on it from the balsamic vinegar on the bruschetta dish we ordered.  Smudge was the size of a quarter but he processed to leave it and walked away.  I quickly got his attention and asked for another.  He wasn't happy about it, but took it and brought back another one.  I could see him walking back to our table with another plate and as he was walking, he was scratching on the plate to get the last of the smudge off of it!  Was still dirty!!!!   A small speck of black was on it. YUCK!!!!!  I asked the female server who took our order for another place and she brought a cleaner one out and apologized.  \n\nAs we were eating our food, which wasn't as good as I remember it to be when I used to frequent this place often.  I saw the server that gave me two dirty places walking around, working obviously, but at one point picked his NOSE!!!!   Omg!!!!   At that point I dropped everything and told my boyfriend lets get the check and get out of here.  \n\nWtf!!!!   That server had no sense of health of any of us dining there!  He should have his health card revoked immediately!!!!  \n\nI thought about bringing it to the attention of a manager but thought to myself why bother...I'm never coming back here ever!   \n\nThe only thing good about this experience is at the server that took our order and checked back on us was nice.  But that isn't enough to bring me back here."

            "review": "This place never seems to disappoint in the area of food.  The management and leadership can still use a little work.  The open at 11:00am and first the girl  had a hard time unlocking the door and keeping it unlocked.  Once she got past that everyone was let in and from the first person on, you were told it was a 5 minute wait to be seated, REALLY???  There was no one seated yet, what was the 5 minute wait for?  \n\nWe requested to be seated outside but when our name was called the person taking us to our table took us to a table inside.  We told her we asked for an outside table and were taken back to the front and told to wait while her and the host figured it out.  In the meantime, other people were seated both inside and out.\n\nFinally we were taken to our table outside.  There was no one else sitting on that side yet so there was a wait for the server to be notified that people were starting to be seated in his area.  \n\nFrom this point on, everything was awesome.  I had the 5oz filet with sweet potatoes and asparagus was cooked more towards medium rare then medium which is not unusual for this kitchen but none the less it was good.\n\nWe also had a salad which was amazing.  At the end we ordered cappuccinos and some desert.  When mine came, I noticed it had cinnamon sprinkled on top.   I called the waiter over and asked if it was cinnamon and he said yes with a surprised look that I was even asking.  I looked at him and asked, Don't you remember I told you I was allergic to cinnamon and we had an entire conversation about this and the sweet potatoes?  He thought for a second and said, oh yes we did talk about that and this was his mistake and he was sorry and would get me another one.  \n\nSo even though the food is really good, from the hostess not listening to where people would like to be seated (inside or out), to the kitchen not really preparing food properly as ordered to the server not really paying attention to his customer and the customer needs is the reason for the 3 stars and the statement at the beginning of this about the management needing a little more work and leadership experience."

The food here is good and the cocktails are well made. My main criticism is the service. It really is one of the worst of places I've been to for slow service. The last 2 times I went, I waited over 40 minutes for my class of wine and the other time it took so long to get the menu that we nearly walked out. They really need to step up their game with the service here, otherwise this place would be fantastic."

The  prosciutto was not good and it actually felt like I was eating onions. I don't like onions.  I never did see the cheese or taste it.  The chicken has a bit of fat on it.  The mashed potatoes got cold very quickly as the air conditioning in the restaurant blew in our faces. My husband ordered a pasta dish with lots of shell fish.

I've had a few of their entrees and they were all very good.  The risotto here is really tasty and one of my favorites.  My only gripe is the portion.  I've asked servers if they do half portions and they've always responded with an \"I don't know.\"  Don't know how hard it is to ask the chefs if its possible, but apparently it is.  For this reason I rarely ever order an entree to myself because it's such a waste.  I sometimes share one with my dining companion and the portion is enough to fill us both up.  The portions are definitely by the whole \"chain\" restaurant standard.  I think it would be nice to offer half portions for those who cannot devour a whole meal to themselves.\n\nThat said, I find myself coming more often just for their happy hour.  It's such an awesome deal.  $2.95 a plate!!!  They have a pretty big selection from their appetizers and the portions are still big enough to share that you won't need one plate for each person.  They also have $5 martinis.  The basil one is tasty but sorta too sweet.  I've also tried the sparkling raspberry and it's not so good.  It tasted like watered down raspberry vodka.  Happy hour is from Monday-Thursday (possibly Friday?) 3-7pm and again at 9-11pm.  \n\nService is so, so.  Not the greatest but not the worst either.  Sometimes it seems like there's an excess of waitstaff.  I don't care too much of the ones I've gotten, they almost always seem rushed and uninterested.  The bar area is not that great either, but I dont expect much; it's whatevzzz.. can't complain at $2.95 lol."

The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful- comfortable booths and drapery hanging from very high ceilings, beautiful colors and lighting (bordering on ornate, but in a good way).  Outside is equally beautiful, including tables and chairs that surround firepits.  They have nightly happy hour (3-6pm, 9pm-close) and really good bruschetta apps with different toppings (shrimp, mushrooms, etc).  Their penne fra diavola with shrimp is delicious (spicy tomato sauce), and they have nice shrimp and crab cakes.  There are nice salads, pastas, chicken, seafood and steak dishes on the menu (Tuscan Italian style).  Their desserts are all available in mini sizes, which is pretty awesome and rare.  Good wine list.   They also have a nice weekend brunch here.   Reservations are a good idea on weekends or you will be waiting well over an hour to sit down.  It is not the best Italian food of my life, but the food is always delicious and the atmosphere is great.  I especially love this place on summer nights, sitting outside."

Not the restaurant's fault, but just an FYI, you may want to request a booth or a table outside instead.\n\nService was a bit slow at first.

She actually turned out to be very nice and attentive, so I guess I can forgive the wait. :p At first glance at the menu, I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to find anything to order. I love Italian food and pasta, but all the dishes seemed complicated for someone who is very picky as myself. My order was about to sound like this, \"Can I have the Chicken Pomodoro Classico with no tomatoes, pine nuts and basil?\" Then, I spotted the only pasta dish with ingredients that I actually liked! Surprising, I know. I had to look twice just to make sure. \n\nThe Campanelle Carbonara had grilled chicken, bacon, Parmesan cheese, spinach and Alfredo. Sold! Our dinners came out about 10 minutes after ordering. My pasta was very flavorful and not salty. The chicken and bacon were cut into perfectly bite sized pieces. The Alfredo sauce was just right and not overpowering. My husband ordered the Roasted Lamb Chops and said they were very good. I never liked lamb. I tried it at Texas de Brazil and didn't like the taste it left in my mouth. However, these lamb chops did look good with the red wine sauce it was served with. For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu, which was delicious as well. A perfect balance of coffee and creme flavors. They also have a gluten free and light menu.\n\nIt looks like they have a MyBRIO loyalty program that you can join for free. According to their website, you get a complimentary appetizer valued up to $10 as a welcome reward. Our server didn't mention that to us at all, so I guess I'll have to remember to ask about it the next time I am there. Brio is a bit on the expensive side, but I would definitely want to come back every so often. The food was awesome! You won't be disappointed."

We usually come here for an occasion, or for lunch happy hour because their pricing is a little expensive.\n\nI always end up getting some sort of pasta, with a nice sauce. I love their ravioli pasta and chicken limon! \n\nCustomer service wise, I've gotten the good, the bad and the in between. Although, our last experience here was actually not so bad. I believe our server might've been new, so she didn't seem like she knew everything on the menu when we asked her about some entrees. It was my friends birthday, so we asked her to bring a surprise cake out for him, or something cute to surprise him. After a few minutes, she comes to our table and asks us who's birthday it is and what kind of cake he would want. He had no idea, and sort of laughed. But instead of just bringing one out to surprise him, she kind of ruined the surprise. But I guess things happen, but it would have been nicer to surprise him. Next time, I'll be sure to make myself clear. LOL"

Many times, that's all I order! The quattro gives you 4 different selections of their famous bruschettas and you get 2 of each one, making it a perfect sharing appetizer (genius!). I'm not a big fan of salads myself, but I LOVE this salad. The steak is prepared medium-rare (again, not usually a fan of bloody steak) but this is fantastic. Of the 10 times that I order this dish, its always just as good as the last. The dressing complements the steak, and the blue cheese, cherry tomatoes, and walnuts put it over the top. We always order it split, so we can share it was well.\n\nMy fiance and I have come to Brio many times, sometimes for a light lunch before seeing a movie, and even one time for an impromptu valentine's day lunch date ... She and I could have gone to a fancy fine dining establishment, but there is just something about Brio and its amazing food and outstanding service that is hard to pass up. The only downside, if you can even call it a downside, is the pricing. It's not totally ridiculous but it is pricey enough to make Brio a twice a month visit, if that."

Reasonable prices and good deserts. Tomato bisque is one of my favorites along with some of there signature entrees. Good selection for salad. They also have a diet calorie menu sometimes I see floating around for those conscious. There is also bonfire setting for the colder weather and sprinkling for the summer outside seating areas.

The place is beautiful with high ceiling and it is located in one of the best shopping places in vegas. They have happy hour too and the bartenders are very nice. They have a patio with fireplace outside and during cooler weather it is very relaxing to jus taut there and have a glass of wine. The food is delicious. It's a great place to entertain guests or meet up with friends. They also have a location in Summerlin but I love the architecture and design of this restaurant. I recommend all the pasta and salad. They have a variety of selections of desserts as well. I love the salmon salad or the salmon dinner. It gets very busy in this place everyday, if you're a walk in is not a good idea unless you are just going to drink and sit by the bar. I recommend to make a reservation although when you have a reservation you will have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes till you get seated and maximum of 30min as it seems like they overbook."

I have to say for the $2.95 price tag on their selections of hour hour menu, the food was delicious and the portions were fair.\n\nMy favorites on their new Spring 2011 Happy Hour menu are the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant (the Black Pepper Sauce is great with pretty much anything savory, try it withthe BRIO Burger or the shrimp from the Shrimptini), followed closely by the Marghita Flatbread.  I would also recommend The Beef Carpaccio, BRIO Burger,and as far as their Strawberry Lemonade (non-alcoholic).\n\nIf you are not working during the weekday afternoon,and happens to be at Town Square shopping or watching a movie or whatever, drop by for inexpensive and very good food.  But plan on arriving around 3:30pm,as the HH is only valid at the bar area, which fillsup rather quickly.\n\nThanks again to Suki L for organizing the UYE here, so I try their HH. And like Anthony M, I think this is also one of my favorite HH in Vegas.\n\nDecor: 5/5 It reminded me of the decor at The Cheese Cake Factory, but with their own twist.  Ilike it.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5  It has good atmosphere.\n\nService: 5/5  The bartenders, waiters,bussers were all great.  Even when it is busy, they paid attention to the customers making sure our orders are placed and our drinks are refilled.\n\nFood:  4/5  Based on the HH menu only.  I liked most of the food I ordered, while some I am glad I tried but would likely not order again now that I know which ones I really like.\n\nPrice:  5/5 for HH\n            3/5 for non-HH.\n\nLocation:  Perfect for those visiting Town Square for the entertainment, shopping, or food.\n\n4 stars.

Since leaving this place, I have been to restaurants that I never knew could exist - restaurants where you can hang out in a trendy restaurant, eat phenomenal food and not spend more than $30/person? What?!\n\nI don't know what it is about Vegas. Maybe it's the fact that Vegas values the bright lights, brand names, glitz and glamour before anything else. \n\nAnyway, a group of us (10 + 1 baby) needed a restaurant that can hold us, have great food, reasonably priced, trendy, and away from the strip.  My friends even though they've lived here all their lives can't even give me any suggestions (I'm flabbergasted). Where I live (Phoenix), I can give you my top 10 and then some. So I decided to on Brio and I've eaten at this restaurant before in Phoenix and was not impressed. Restaurant reminds me that of a Cheesecake factory, chain restaurant.  \n\nThey did seat us right away, which was nice. The bread came out and the group was having a fun time.  We are loud as ever and the noise level of the restaurant was loud so we didn't feel like we were bothering anyone with our obnoxious rants an laughs so that was good.  I ordered the gluten free grilled salmon with lemon and caper sauce. The flavor was ok. Nothing to rave about.\n\nI wish I had better options to fit what I was looking for in my dining experience. At the end of the night, it wasn't the flavor of the food that made the night a \"good\" night.  It was the fact that a group of 11 was able to get together, talk and laugh as loud as we want, not cringe at the bill, and still be happy and full."

Although it IS indeed a chain, which is not my favorite part of a restaurant, it is still nicer than your average.\n\nTheir outdoor seating is spectacular.  The misters make it bearable to sit in the summer Vegas heat, the fire pits are great for the cooler evenings.\n\nThe food is pretty solid - I love their entree sized salads.  I can't comment on cocktails or desserts, as I've never had one there, but I'm guessing it'll push above average.\n\nOverall, it was a great place for chilling on the patio or for a business lunch."

Especially a third time. Prices are pretty high but I was out with a friend and didnt have the family so that was ok. But the food once again was just mediocre. I ended up having the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. Sauce drowned everything out and made it very soggy tasting...The only thing that made up for the food was that I wasnt paying and my peach bellini (AMAZING)..."

So moist, succulent and ;....I'm drooling. Best ever. My BIL ordered what I wanted originally, Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. AH-MAZING! So flavorful and innovative. The BIL's gf (haha I love acronyms) needed gluten free dishes only and the server was most accommodating. Actually, the service was the best I've had in years. Overall the ambiance is in a beautiful setting in a 'strip mall' look of Town Center, but I am now craving for the bistecca and live no where near a Brio :( Will definitely go again!"

It wasn't anything special but I know experience wise, Brio is one of the best and most popular places in Town Square. It's been more than a year until I heard about the happy hour. Their bar happy hour features $5 drinks and $3.99 items. I went with the chips and burger and for that price you can't go wrong!  They also have shrip, ravioli and another 5 or so items on the happy hour menu starting at 9PM. Ill definitely be back soon!"

            "review": "First time at Brio today! Decided to sit outside because the weather was amazeballs. The wait wasn't too bad (20-ish minutes) and we got to sit outside in the nice weather. However, there were numerous hostesses that all seemed not very friendly. They were just okay. Our waiter was chill and friendly enough. Key word -- \"enough\". Meh.\n\nMy lunch date ordered something on the brunch menu and waited quite a while before the waiter came and told us that brunch ended at 2 (it was 3pm). However, the menu stated that brunch ends at 3:30pm, which was bewildering to say the least. Last time something like this happened to me where my original dish couldn't be made and I waited a while, the restaurant gave me my meal for free. Brio offered nothing as compensation and the apology sounded far from sincere.\n\nSo why 4 stars if the service was not very good? The fooooood! The sourdough bread was warm and yummy and the cracker positively bursted with flavor. My risotto was tasty and cheesy without being too heavy (the chicken in it was a little dry though). The salad I chose with my risotto was the wedge salad, which was huge and crispy and well-plated and just awesome. \n\nMy date ended up ordering the salmon with angel hair pasta and he was a little disappointed when the plate arrived at the table. \"Only this much food for 15 bucks?!\" Well he took a bite of the salmon and was surprised to find it juicy and tender. The taste definitely made it worth the price.\n\nThe food far exceeded my expectations but the service left me hungry for more. I will probably eat here again if I'm at Town Square and the weather is nice. Hopefully the employees will be friendlier and enjoy their jobs more next time I visit."

The shrimp was ok and had a lot of kick.  The orzo and farro that came with it was extremely oversalted.  It's as if they put a canister of salt into the cooking water.\nDessert trio- very good.

I thought there was going to be chicken in my dish, i'm sure I read it had chicken in it, but all I got was ham as the meat. Kind of pricy for what I got, but I still ate it, with some hot sauce just because I was hungry. I probably won't eat hear again unless their was going to be a good reason for it.

I was pretty clear to the hostess originally of the name I was looking for, and I'd be at the bar if they arrived.

From the bar, you can't easily see the hostess station...\n\nSigh...anyways, while at the bar, I was greeted warmly and the service was superb...the table for 18 was placed in the middle of the main dining area, which was fine, but we'd been assured there would be a private space for our group.  Guess we got outbid by a larger group?  Anyways, not trying to be picky, but when I know this will be at least a $500 tab, I expect to be treated accordingly!!  \n\nThe food server(s) tho made up for the initial impression...and that's the best part of this review!  The food wasn't what I felt to be any better than Olive Garden, and I'd actually have preferred the food there?  Go figure!  We ordered appetizers, not impressed with the lobster bisque, the roasted garlic spinach artichoke dip, or the breads....so, bring on the salad....I had a house salad, which sounded pretty amazing as described by the food server, but was a disappointment when I got it, and I know the feeling was mutual with the other salad that was ordered too.  \n\nMain course, we had some lasagna orders, some veal marsala orders, some carbonara orders, and some other pasta dishes that I couldn't discern....no one from our group was impressed, and we're not foodies or culinary school graduates or anything, so that's saying a LOT about the quality of the food....it was filling!!  \n\nPersonally, I don't think I'll be going back, but I wouldn't say no to a date taking me there....I'll just know not to expect to be WOW'ed by the food, and just enjoy the atmosphere!!"

So having said that.. I had come in for dinner a few times. I am that guy when it comes to a non-belief in \"American Style Italian\" or whatever Brio claims to be.\n\nAs for the quality of the food.. it isn't bad.. just nothing spectacular. Lately My friends and I have been dropping in for Happy hour on Thursdays as they have a $5 'martini' menu along side their daily happy hour of $2.95 'Tuscan Tasters'' .. \n\nThe thing is, they get so swamped with customers during happy hour, that the service gets seriously patchy. I'm totally down for someone hustling amongst the tables they are waiting on, just trying to do the job and make some descent money.. in fact I can appreciate it. It's the consistent mistakes on the bill, the negative attitude, especially fromt he bar staff, and the disregard for any style of customer service from the staff. There is constant conversation about everything but work, and in a very loud way. \n\nI honestly know that this is literally a step in some direction from a place like 'Chili's\" or 'Friday's\" but with the environment of a bit higher end restaurant that they are trying to create.. you would hope for more is all I am saying. \n\nIn the end of it all, I would be back for the Happy Hour.. as it's good prices and descent nosh when you are shopping or heading to a movie.. but I think I will be looking for other options when I am next down at Town Square.

Adding the fresh, delicious sourdough bread equals a completely enjoyable meal. I will definitely be back for more!"

For us the price is mid to high.  Server was outstanding, did his best to please us, i wish i remember his name.  The salad I ordered, three tomatos something, not excellent.  Server said without the chicken it gets mixed reviews.  Anyway go elsewhere if you're a veggie cause there are much better \"Italian\" places with better selections."

I'm usually pretty skeptical with Italian food in general because I'm allergic to gluten and can't eat much...but I figured I could find something to  suit me.\n\nLoved it here. It's located in this high end outdoor mall (which we didn't see too much of, thanks to scorching Vegas weather...) and the restaurant itself is beautiful. I loved the building with it's high ceilings & open space. I made me feel like I was dining in a castle :)\n\nIt was still a little early for dinner (about 5:30), so we were seated right away, although we had no reservations. We were given a bread basket with some flatbread crisps to munch on while we were looking over the menu. I didn't try any of it, but my mom & uncle said the bread was yummy. I ordered the sweet potato & chicken risotto and a  salad, my mom ordered a flatbread pizza and my uncle got the crab cakes. We all decided to share the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer.\n\nThe salad was amazing. Best cesar salad I've had, and I've had quite a few in my time. The dressing wasn't too salty...and the tanginess was perfection. The dip was a bit too salty for me...but I tasted a little bit of the parmesan crisps that come with it & they were great. \n\nWhen my food arrived it was very pretty :) The risotto wasn't gummy (which is usually the case) and the flavor was great...but I was a little weirded out because they used dark meat chicken. There were ligaments still attached, like they used a chicken leg instead of a chicken breast. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I am just used to seeing white meat used, as opposed to dark. It tasted fine, tho...I took it all in stride.\n\nI ordered a creme brulee for dessert and it was pretty good. Not the best, but definitely up there.\n\nAll in all, the ambiance was nice & the waitress was very friendly. We had a good time here. I'm don't usually visit lavish restaurants when we're in Vegas, but I'd definitely give this place a try again. I'd love to try some pasta here, but I really would hate to land myself in the hospital..."

We had to wait four approximately 30 minutes for a table (Saturday night and lots of prom goers to contend with).  Once we were seated our waiter came right over and took our drink order.   We also received a bread basket that included herbed, baked cheese crackers which were an excellent alternative to bread.  I ordered the steak salad - PHENOMENAL! The flavors were amazing, lettuce, arugala, steak, feta cheese, balamic drizzle and a delicious dressing.  I will go back next time we are in Vegas.  I would never have known about this place if not for our friends that live there.  We wish there was one in Seattle!!!"

            "review": "Me and two girlfriends were out and about in Vegas this past weekend and after all the window shopping we had done, we realized we were famished. So we drove and came upon Brio. The first thing out of me and my friends mouth was HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS!!!! See we frequent the Brio in Scottsdale and we love their happy hour special in which a select few of their appetizers are all $2.95. We snag a great parking spot and walk into Brio where the sign says happy hour 3-7 in the bar. SCORE!\n\nWe are immediately seated and our waiter comes over to take our drink orders and we say may we also get the happy hour menu. He proceeds to say that happy hour doesn't start until 3:30pm but I say your sign says 3pm.  He proceeds to tell me still needs to be changed but happy hour does not start to 3:30pm. We say fine, we will wait the 20mins until happy hour starts. He proceeds to walk away but what he doesn't realize is that I am still watching him and I swear the look on his face was like these bitches.... So needless to say when he came back I called him out on it. He let me know that if his face conveyed that then he was very sorry and that he apologies for the misunderstanding. Hmm suspect... (however he got back into my good gracious later)\n\nWe order Brio Burgers, Ravioli Caprese, Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta and Sliced Steak Bruschetta. Now we have had this before at the Scottsdale Brio and each time the burgers have been perfect and the bruschetta has been divine. This time not so much. The burger was perfect on the inside but burnt on the outside, the Ravioli and all the Brushchetta came out lukewarm at best. Our waiter came over to ask how everything was and I was like eh do you really want to know? So we told him that we weren't happy but we were hungry and we would eat it anyway. He offered to make everything again but we declined as we had already waited for about 30 mins for the food after we ordered. He says I will tell the manager and she may come over to talk to you.\n\nWell the GM came over to talk to us and asked how things were. We told her that we were use to how great everything was at the Scottsdale location and we came here because of that notion and we were disappointed but hey for $2.95 per appetizer, we cannot complain too much. She said that she had just spent a month at the Scottsdale location and this was her first day back and she apologized for the meal and she said she would take care of it for us. We were all like wow, thank you that is very generous. She asked if we wanted anything else and we declined and thanked her again.\n\nLittle did we know that when she said she would take care of it for us, she meant the entire bill!! Drinks and all. We asked for the bill thinking we had to at least pay for our drinks and our waiter let us know that the entire bill had been taken care of. WOW! We did leave our waiter a nice tip and left out of there shaking our heads. \n\nSo maybe this Brio was having an off afternoon but I give it 1.5 stars for the food but 5 stars for the GM for being extra generous."

The restaurant was not busy this particular Sunday night, but reservations are recommended. We were quickly served hot bread and butter which was a good start because I was starving!  Our server was nice, but she was inconsistent. After she took our orders, we hardly saw her again. Someone else brought our dinner to the table, and we were all shocked that they didn't offer cheese. This is supposed to be an Italian place right?? We had to wait a while for our server to come back and check on us and then we were able to ask for fresh parmesan. After that, we hardly saw her again except when it came time to drop off the check. Even after that, she disappeared for a good 20 minutes and we needed some things on our bill adjusted so we finally had to flag someone down to ask them to tell our server to come back to the table. \n\nThe food, meh, nothing special and surely over priced. I went with the chicken under the brick, which is a grilled chicken breast with marsala mushroom sauce, served with mashed potatoes and veggies. The marsala sauce was really good, I just wish there were more of it. I loved the vegetables that came with my meal especially the carrots, they were a tad sweet so I think they might have been glazed. I also ordered a side chopped salad which was just okay as well. For each side salad it was $4.95! That is for lettuce, a few chopped veggies, and dressing. The bill for just me and my mom was $54! Other people in my party agreed the food was just okay and definitely overpriced. I hear they have a good happy hour, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but I wouldn't be opposed to trying the happy hour."

Once you come in, there's kind of like, an Italy-feel atmosphere. Which I love because it feels like I'm eating lunch or dinner somewhere in Italy. \n\nTheir service is PERFECT, they're very welcoming and always introducing themselves in a friendly manner. I come here too often to the point where they recognized who I am and my order, kind of embarrassing but at the same time, am proud to be a regular! \n\nUnto the food, so far I've only tried their tuscan grilled pork chops, beef carpaccio (this appetizer is a MUST), filet mignon, and some pasta. ALL of it were perfectly cooked. I'm very picky when it comes to eating meat and I'm just so glad I found a restaurant that are consistent with grilling their steaks. Although, I've been ordering my usual (pork chops and carpaccio) the last couple of visits, I think it's time to expand my options, but I shouldn't have to worry about getting something that I won't like because brio never disappoints. I highly recommend this place!"

The atmosphere, decor, and service really deserve 4 stars.  They loose 1.5 stars for the food.\n\nI ordered a large Caesar salad, and a Mediteranean Penne dish.   I had the option to get a small salad with the entre for an additional $3.85, but the waiter said it was pretty small so I asked for the large salad entre (which was supposed to cost a whopping $11.00).   The salad came in a large plate which was half empty.  I love Caesar salad, but this one was mediocre at best.  Hardly any flavor.   And the description bragged about the house dressing and brioche croutons  - both tasteless.  When I finished the waiter asked how I liked the salad, and seemed very surprised when I told him that it was bland.   The only good news was that they didn't charge me $11,00 for the salad, but only $5.00, though I don't know if this was because of what I said about it.\n\nThe penne dish was pasta with mushrooms, dried tomatoes and fetta and a very little bit of a tasteless sauce.   This is one of those places where if you ask for parmesan cheese, the waiter makes a show of grinding it on your pasta.   I suppose they want you to think this is entertainment, but I think it is really just a way for them to save money on cheese.   As you watch, they grind and grind and grind, and when they're done you may have a teaspoon or two of cheese on your pasta.   For what this dish cost ($15.15) they could have put a dish of cheese on the table - it might have helped an otherwise boring meal.\n\nThe only bright side of lunch was excellent sour dough bread which tasted like San Francisco sour dough, but they told me it was shipped in daily from Los Angeles.\n\n$25.00 plus tip with ice tea.   I think I would have done better at Olive garden."

The one at tivoli has the same shitty food, but with a more prosperous and much older crowd. The good news is tivoli has live music in the summer. I will probably be going there for *drinks only* whenever they have music."

            "review": "Brio surprised me with their fresh, delicious food and large portion sizes.  I've been to both the Town Square and Tivoli Village locations, and both are quite pretty inside, reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory in style.  \n\nMy favorite starter is the spicy shrimp and eggplant: shrimp over romano crusted eggplant in a black pepper cream sauce, amazing!  \n\nFor entrees, the lasagna bolognese is HUGE and very delicious, it could easily serve 2 people!  It's layers of noodles in a bolognese sauce topped with alfredo and romano/mozzarella cheese, yum.  If you're looking for something lighter, I would absolutely recommend the grilled salmon salad.  The salmon is cooked perfectly, and sits atop spring greens, asparagus, tomatoes, feta cheese, and crispy shoestring potatoes in a balsamic vinaigrette.  The combination of textures and flavors is really delicious and satisfying, without being too heavy.  The only entree I haven't liked here was the shrimp verduta.\n\nThe kids menu is quite impressive as well.  We ordered the salmon ($6.95) for our daughter, it came with a large piece of grilled salmon, mashed potatoes (or sub french fries in our case), steamed broccoli and a drink of her choice.  I could have made a meal of this, it was delicious!  They have other options: chicken parmesan, grilled chicken, lasagna, mac and cheese, burgers and pizzas.  \n\nWe've ordered catering from here in the past, and it is a great deal!  We ordered the lasagna bolognese, the lobster and shrimp fettucine (shrimp and lobster in a spicy lobster butter sauce) and the pasta brio (penne pasta with chicken, mushrooms, and a roasted red pepper sauce), all for $160.  It comes with a tray of fresh bread, a tray of their crispy flatbread, and we also had a coupon for a free dessert tray with a $100 order.  They gave us a generous serving of their tiramisu.  Each tray serves 6-8 people, and we had enough for 14 people with tons of leftovers.  Everyone had a different favorite pasta, so it was enjoyed by all!"

We got seated right away, 4 total in the party, and for about 10-15 mins no waiter or anyone noticed us or said anything until I finally asked a bus boy to grab her. Not a good start but whatever, the service was bad for brio standards tonight, at least she was friendly. \n\nSo the good, the reason we come. The food was great. We had calamri and sausage pepperoni pizza to start. Great. I got the lobster bisque and as always great. For dinner I had lamb, great!!, my wife had rissoito, pretty good, my friend had shrimp Vodak pasta, very good and his girlfriend had steak salad, which she enjoyed. For dessert we split tiramisu and creme breleu, both very good. Overall great meal and mediocre service. Will come back as the service is usually much better than today."

Again, we were frowned upon when we asked to take it back to the warmer until we were ready for it.  Once we were ready for the pasta, we had to ask for Parmesan cheese, again with an unfriendly response from the bartenders.  But unfortunately the Parmesan cheese couldn't even save the pasta - it was bland, almost sauce less & had very little chicken.

The restaurant has a certain sophistication to it: chic, elegant interior with tasteful accoutrements, high ceilings, flowing drapery, and well-trained staff -- you wouldn't even think that this is a chain restaurant. \n\nThe menu has a good selection of insalatas, bruschettas, zuppas, paninis, and pasta. They also have a nice selection of house specialties but I didn't order any of that. The wine selection is not too extensive but you'll certainly find the perfect wine to pair your dish with. \n\nThe shrimp and scallop risotto was well-seasoned and flavorful; I paired it with a glass of pinot Grigio. My friends loved their dishes as well, which they generously shared with me (and vice versa).\n\nThe price range is very reasonable considering the restaurant's ambiance, the quality of dishes, and the quality of service that we got.

The servers are nice and the patio is awesome, when the weather's right. The inside is a large, mostly open space that can get a little loud-ish during peak times, but not so unbearable that you have to yell to your eating companion(s). The price is what you'd expect to pay: not the cheapest, but not that pricey, either; I consider it a slightly less-expensive alternative to my other favorite Vegas/Henderson Italian joints, Casa di Amore, Nora's, and Gaetano's."

She even went out of her way to separately send out our dishes so we weren't overwhelmed with food. Not like thats a bad thing or anything!\n\nI will crave you again soon Brio."

I should've went to the whole foods around the corner instead of this Italian restaurant because the service was horrific !!! the bread was  stale I ordered penne alla vodka with no pancetta and the gentleman brought me a gnocchi ravioli with ricotta cheese ....when I went to send it back he tried to argue with me to tell me that in the menu it says something else ....and I told him that I know what the menu says because I ordered Penne alla vodka  he then sent the manager over who was very nice she offered to pay for my entire dinner asked me if I needed anything else and I told her that she needed to hire people that can read and write... Let me add that I specifically requested penne pasta with allla vodka sauce no ricotta cheese and no pancetta ..if The waiter or the chef had an issue with my order they should've told me but instead of that my order was completely disregarded and that's to the gentleman who decided to message me privately who is now blocked"

            "review": "Brio is a nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Town Square. The prices are affordable and comparable to any other chain restaurant found at a mall such as Cheesecake Factory. I like that they offer a number of gluten-free options including their pasta. The restaurant itself is huge with a nice high ceiling. Service was prompt and our waitress checked in on us frequently.\n\nLunch started off with a couple of appetizers including the beef carpaccio and calamari fritto misto. Although the carpaccio color appeared on the paler side, the actual beef mixed with greens, capers, and mustard aioli tasted delicious. I was disappointed that the calamari was on the soggier side. We were served the standard bread and Parmesan crisps, but I was annoyed by the ice cold and rock hard butter, which has always been a major pet peeve of mine. \n\nLunch specials included a two course meal featuring a soup or salad plus a pasta dish. I got the lobster bisque, which was good, but on the salty side. I had a feeling that it was mostly filled with the shrimp to cover up for the lack of lobster meat. Nonetheless, it was a nice excuse to eat more bread. For my pasta dish, I got the campanelle carbonara. The plate was less than a full entree, but by that time I was getting pretty full. For drinks, they don't carry any beer on draft.\n\nAlthough, I wasn't super impressed with the food, given the service, space, and prices, Brio is pretty fancy for a mall restaurant and a nice fit for Town Square."

Obviously, Brio Tuscan Grille hasn't gotten that message.\n\nWe chose Brio from a host of other restaurants for a Welcoming Dinner for our son's wedding. The coordinator (Tiffany) could not have been nicer and more helpful. She walked us through the menu, choosing insalata, zuppa and entrees as well as passed appetizers. When asked, she easily recommended wines to compliment the other beverage offerings.\n\nLast, but not least, she recommended a couple of bakeries to handle my request for a groom's cake. All of this over the phone or through emails.\n\nEverything was excellent and the waitstaff was extremely attentive. We were able to reserve the Colosseum Room which was perfect for our group. We were able to choose 3 entrees for the group (they printed a menu for our guests) and chose Pasta Brio, Wood-Grilled Salmon and Tuscan Grilled Pork Chops - all excellent from the comments I heard. I can actually comment on the Pork Chop - excellent! We chose the Bruschetta, Beef Carpaccio Crostinis and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp for appetizers and they went over very well - especially the shrimp.\n\nThis is a great place to go if you want to escape the Strip. It is located just south of the airport off of Las Vegas Boulevard in Town Square a new shopping area which is quite nice as well. An excellent experience all around."

The mac and cheese on the kids menu was not your normal kids Mac and cheese and actually tasted like pasta.  It was a portion for an adult or even three kids!   \n\nNow for dessert, order the caramel marscapone cheesecake.

Brio was a great treat - I actually like this place better than some of the restaurants we went to in Italy.  Not that the Italian food in Italy didn't taste good, but the bold flavors at Brio were more pleasing to my palette.\n\nLarge, open, tastefully decorated, the mood was set for relaxation.  Went there with 4 of my team members and this was all our first visit.  The only down was that the acoustics and ambient noise didn't make for the best conversation but as long as your voice was strong, you were good.\n\nService was good and staff was pleasant and orders came out accurately (and quickly).\n\nThe Caprese Bruchetta rocked.  Lots of flavor and great texture.  The sweet balsamic was the perfect addition.\n\nThe Caprese Ravioli was equally as good.  Lots of fresh baby tomatoes to season the dish.  Large pieces of pasta and hearty enough to make a meal.\n\nI had the Sweet Potato and Grilled Chicken Risotto.  DELICIOUS.  I wasn't sure what to expect as it seemed like an odd combination but they pulled it off nicely.  Add in some fresh asparagus and i was very satisfied with the meal.\n\nAt the table was also salmon, tomato bisque, and the lasagna.  All said they enjoyed their meals.\n\nWe had everything except alcohol and we were out of there for around $150.\n\nDefinitely will go here again."

My husband and I very rarely get out of the house, and on our long awaited date day had planned to go to brio for the happy hour that we've heard so much about. I was looking forward to it greatly, but upon arriving the bar was completely packed, not a single chair available. We asked if we could have happy hour at one of the nearby tables and were told we had to be sitting at the bar or on one of the couches (which were also all taken). The bar area was surrounded with 10-15 unoccupied tables that would have done the job, but instead of allowing us to sit and enjoy happy hour with everyone else, our business was turned away. Extremely disappointed in how this situation was handled. Management wasn't even apologetic. Will not be returning... Waste of my time and excitement. Ended up taking our business to yard house, where they were happy to take care of us."

I really wanted to address this with Brio and not the rest of the world, but with no response whatsoever, here I go. I had brunch a month back, and ordered the eggs, home fries, and bacon. It says it comes with brioche toast on the menu. It does not. After addressing this with the waitress, the manager comes over. He stands there for a little while (very awkward) before finally asking what the issue was. Wasn't sure if he was waiting for me to say something first? Anyhow, he told me they don't have or have ever had brioche toast, and I asked him why the menu says they do? He says he doesn't print the menus and that corporate does. Wow!! I couldn't believe his answer! Maybe the correct answer should have been, \"You know you're right, it must be a misprint, I should let corporate know.\" It's very deceptive to advertise brioche toast to people and then serve crappy white stale toast. I rarely bring up anything I am displeased with at a restaurant, but this was Brio's third strike with me. The last time it was a cold omelette that I didn't say anything about. I wanted to give Brio another chance since I have been going here since the opening, (and their eggplant shrimp appetizer is actually pretty amazing), but three strikes and you're out."

The specials are also only at the bar area or patio area, so be sure to snag the first seat you see; it's first come first serve.\n\nMy favorites have been the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant (you have to scoop up every bit of that sauce!), Braised Meatballs and Polenta (I had no idea what polenta was before this, but now I love it), and the Sliced Steak Bruschetta.  There are many more items on the menu but these have stood out to me the most.\n\nDining outside is great, especially in front of a roaring fire on a cool fall evening.

We waited around 10 minutes to be introduced to our waitress and get our orders in. There was an average of 20 minute increments between getting our drinks (besides water) food, any refills and the check. This was a Thursday evening towards the end of the night, no reason at all for service to take that long.\nAs far as the food goes, it was okay. The spinach dip appetizer was hot and full of flavor, definitely a large enough portion to share with 3-4 people. I had the Campanelle Carbonara which had an overwhelming flavor of bacon. It literally took over the entire dish. My boyfriend had the Chicken Limone which was a nice well-rounded entree between the meat and veggies. Dessert was a Torta Di Cioccolata and was the best part of the entire meal- melted chocolate inside the cake complements very nicely with the scoop of vanilla gelato.\nMaybe we'll come back for Happy Hour next time, I've heard good things.

Why?\n\nPart of our positive experience was the waitress we had, which is always appreciated in any establishment. Given the description above you would think she wouldn't know the wine list, right? Wrong. Not only did she had qualitative descriptions about their Tuscan Chiantis, but when she brought out samples of their by the glass range (another plus), her suggestion was spot on! (Winning Chianti selection was San Fabiano)\n\nHer recommendation for a non-meat plate (Mediterranean penne?) was also a great choice. And the fresh sourdough bread made Zefferinis paltry store bought sliced broad baguette weep. \n\nAnd always a huge warm smile. \n\nOne last point: we were in the back room which was intimate and quiet, though I could imagine the main salon would be quiet extremely noisy. \n\nIn sum, if you're looking for good food off the strip and aren't trying to crap shoot fine dining without a star, give Brio a try."

When somebody questioned the wait -- since half of the tables were empty -- she replied that they only had one server for the patio. Huh? Five minutes later the manager came over, and it was obvious that he was asking why people were waiting? Next thing you know, everyone had seats on the patio. Let me guess...they assigned another waiter to the patio? Anyway, the bruschetta was good, the steak in the steak salad was a little wanting, and the waiter needs a little more training: I asked for Chenin Blanc. He said that he didn't know if they had that brand. I do have to say that it was very nice on the patio. I'd go back."

It was part of wedding festivities. They were so nice to let me in a bit early to have the table set so that all of my guests would feel like guests. This is what we ordered. \n\nAppetizers: \nFried calamari and flatbread BBQ chicken pizza \n\nEntrees (everyone was pleased) \nPenne w/Vodka sauce, carbonara, fettuccine rustica, paninis, risotto and some brunch items \n\nCoffee service: \nCappuccino and coffee for dessert. \n\nGluten Free: \nAs I was ordering, I mentioned no croutons with my salad ..can't have gluten. Server asked if I had an allergy, I said yes. They made all the adjustments to accommodate my dietary restrictions. There is a whole protocol that goes into effect to limit cross contamination. Awesome. I'm not as sensitive, but those with allergies should feel confident that they have a knowledgeable staff. I do have to mention that initially I asked the hostess and she said no they do not have GF options/choices. They clearly do. So happy that my waiter(s) and kitchen are informed about food allergies. Our waiters were Ryan and Dino."

Same situation with the water too, we always have to look for someone. \n   We ordered two dishes and shared, Crispy Eggplant Pomodoro and Mezza Chicken Limone.

I am a very loyal customer so once you get me going, i will return. And this is my second time here. \nMy first time was the best. The waiter was also the server and he looked like he enjoyed working there. If i was able to request who my waiter is, and if I remembered his name, i would have done it in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, i cant because the second time, the customer service was so off. My waiter was great and friendly, but my server was not. He just threw the bread onto the table(it even slid upwards). Like wtf? Crapper server. Pissed me off. And then when he brought my dish, he left the plate half hanging off the table in front of me. It could have easily fallen all onto me but I grabbed it and pushed it in. Something he should have done because I can easily burn myself from that. Usually, all the waiters will tell you to not touch the plate. This guy just leaves it half hanging from the table and expect you to take care of it yourself. Also, when he came to pay time, i waited for a long while and had to ask someone else if I can get the check and to go box. :/ my waiter just disappeared on us. \n\nHowever, i will still leave this a 5/5 because i personally love all the other waiters. Especially the waiter from our first time being here. He was so ecstatic to serve us and take our order. He has really good opinions on what to eat and everything. The food itself has always been delicious. The first and the second time, I can honestly say I rather go to brio than cpk. The pricing is only $2-$5 more expensive than cpk but its also $2-$5 worth more than cpk.\n\n*edited, changed it to 4/5 since the manager here completely avoided my concern about how the server during my second visit was rude."

I did hear some comments from co-workers that the there was less vegetarian options on the dinner menu vs. the lunch/brunch menu.   \n\nI'm not going to compare it chains like Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden.  But I did like the ambiance and service was good.  I've never been to Tuscany but if it's all about the feast, Brio certainly is a good place to go for big groups if your in Town Square."

This place is perfect for a Girls Night out, my girlfriends and I ordered everything that was on their menu for HH. I also took my boyfriend here, he loved it. We loved their Crispy Shrimp Piccante, Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip and Brio Burger. Their service isn't too bad either, our server forgot about our drinks. He apologized and said it was on the house. Good job Brio!.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to more Girls Night Out here and a date night's with my leading man."

Love the option to sit at the bar inside or out!  3.95 for a wonderfully cooked burger?!! My husband loves the carpaccio, be sure to ask for extra sauce. They used to have a steak brushetta with Gorgonzola on the happy hour menu, I am sad its gone but they still have great selections, like my favorite spicy shrimp and eggplant, again ask for extra sauce.\n\n You can get a cocktail for 5 dollars as well! We usually stick to the martini, but have tried a few of there specialty cocktails and they were all good. We usually sit at the bar close to Del Mar, he is so awesome! He's busy and still manages to make us perfect drinks, he is always attentive and smiling and always gives outstanding service!! He's in my top 3 bartenders in Vegas!

Crispy triangles that are coated in herbs, sesame seeds, and cheese full of flavor and texture.\nOur favorite is the Pasta alla Vodka. That is why we come to Brio.\nMy heart skips a little beat when they put this dish down in front of me and shower it in finely grated parmesan cheese. The aroma of the vodka sauce is one I have not experiened in any other Italian restaurant. Can't quite put my finger on what makes that distinctive delicious Brio Vodka sauce so special. Maybe it's the garlic that's been shaved thin (with razor blades?), or the fresh basil that perfumes the sauce, or it's the star of the dish...the soft pillows of heaven...the delicate ricotta filled pasta purses that melt in your mouth and go oh so very well with the sauce. I swear someone else must be eating my dish because it goes too quick until you devour the last of the pasta and reach for the sourdough bread to sop up the rest of this amazing sauce...it would be a sin not to!\nThis is all I want to write about Brio, because when you come there you must order the Pasta Alla Vodka :)"

When we arrived, they told me it would be 10 minute wait.  We waited more like 20 minutes before getting seated which is ok but we had asked for a booth and they tried to seat us at  a round set for 6 when there was two of us in the party.  Directly across from the table was a dirty booth.  \nAfter being sat, 10 minutes go by with no sign of service.  When we did finally get someone to the table, he dropped of bread and left without one word.  We watched server after server walk by without anyone coming over.   A table that sat down after us (across from us) got service well before us.  It had to be at least 15 minutes until our waiter arrived.  Once he got there, he apologized for the wait.  It was smooth sailing from there. \nFor a chain restaurant, the food was good.  The Harvest Salad had great flavors however, needed more cheese.  \nI think I will sit at the bar next time.  May be the service there will be better."

The asparagus I was charged extra for, was undercooked and bland.

Lofting ceilings with great colors covering the walls make for a warm inviting place.\n\nFood\nAppetizer - Free bread came in a small basket, it contained three triangular cracker thin bread slices covered in seasoning and a chuck of soft bread.  The cracker bread was seasoned, looked, and tasted like pizza.   They could have offered to bring more bread when it was gone.  If I was eating some pasta as my meal I would have liked it to arrive without me begging. \n\nMain Course - They did not have any stuffed pasta that I was interested in.  So I went with the sliced steak salad.  The steak was over peppered and the medallion pieces needed to be cut.  The lettuce was nothing special, mostly iceberg chopped into small squares.  The highlight of the meal was the candied pecans.  This comment you could put under service or here, the menu indicates that steak will be cooked to order.  The waiter  never asked and I forgot as it took a long time to place our meal order with him.\n\nDessert - skipped it  \n\nService - This was really lacking.  The floor was simply nasty.  Noodles all over the floor next to wear I sat.  As we sat there I noticed a Gatorade bottle on the floor next to me after the lady at the next table over placed in on the floor before they left.  The busy boy must have not noticed it as he kicked it under the table.  I typically only drink water with my meal now, and when you fill a 12 ounce glass completely with ice, you better be coming back with more water frequently.  But not the case here, only once was my water refilled, placing the glass at the edge of the table should all I have to do.   As we were finishing up our meal, a different bus boy took care of the other table next to us.  The table was covered in a table cloth.  When he placed the new one on the table it was like he was making a bed up and down with cloth.  I know it was a hot night but I really do not need a table cloth fan next to me."

My point, veggies were delish!\n- the skin in the chicken was crisp and crunchy \n- the meat on the chicken was moist, I didn't even need a knife\n- not a huge mashed-potato fan but it's mixed with 'mystery' seasoning that revolutionized my thoughts on mashed-potatos\n\nOur server was genuine and knowledgeable. I just can't give that fifth star because of the hostess though.. It was dinner time when we came in (6 adults and 2 kids) and she told us it was about an hour wait. Understandable. We were all tired and weren't about to walk to another restaurant though. Noticing a few empty booths, we asked to be seated there but she promptly told us it's only for parties of 6. They looked pretty spacious and the two kids are no more than 4. We said we didn't mind cramping together and she told us, 'She would need to ask because they don't set the tables for 8.' She seemed extremely annoyed at our request as if placing two more plates was such a huge hassle -.-\n\nGood customer service is a big deal to me.

The ambiance here is warm, the inside dimly lit and there's also plenty of outdoor seating when the weather gets warm. Half of the bar is inside the restaurant and the other half opens out to the outdoor seating area.\n\nBrio has good happy hour specials for Town Square; apps starting around $4 and drinks at $5. Great customer service; the bartenders are all very friendly. \n\nMy favorite, the Shrimptini (cocktail shrimp) was taken off the happy hour menu and I was devastated. I still order it though because it's that good!! The beef carpaccio is excellent as well and I believe that's still on the happy hour menu. The black pepper shrimp is also very good; bite size eggplant pieces topped with peppered shrimp, glazed in a red sauce. Yum!\n\nThe only actual dish I've ordered here was a salmon Caesar salad which I had for lunch one day. It came out pre-tossed and was a decent salad. I would give the bar food and service a 5/5 and the Caesar salad a 3/5. Definitely a great place to come for drinks and apps! Especially once it gets nice outside again, Brio is a great choice in Town Square if you wish to eat and drink while enjoying the Vegas sunshine."

We got there early around 5 pm.  We were immediately seated, and our server Dino was awesome. \nHe gave us great recommendations like the Pasta Alla Vodka and I also had the insalata on the side.  \nThe bread basket kept getting refilled and the timing was perfect.  Our son absolutely loved the bread.   I think it was a mild sourdough? Whatever it was, it was soft and delicious. \n\nOur salads arrived and they were entree sized.   I tasted hubby's Caesar which had great  garlic flavor!\nMy wedge salad with goat cheese and parmesan dressing was EXCELLENT!  There was just enough dressing and flavoring,  but it was not excessive.  Plus, I was expecting a small salad but this was substantial and I had no trouble finishing it.\nMy son's \"mac and cheese\" arrived and he proclaimed it to be \"SO GOOD.\"  Rarely have we heard our picky son rave about any food. \nMy pasta alla vodka consisted of heavenly pillows of dough filled with ricotta in a dreamy \"rosetta\" sauce.  I had chicken added for a few bucks more. \nI took a taste of hubby's angel hair pasta with shrimp which had a nice lemony flavor.  \nOur server Dino was great.  He anticipated our needs and was at our table at just the right time.  None of that annoying repetitious \"Is your food ok?\" before you even had a taste of it.  My ice tea was refilled without having to ask. \nAnother note, the venue is absolutely beautiful and classy in a warm Tuscany style.  It was not ostentatious at all and there's outdoor seating which on a cooler day would have been ideal.   However, it was over 100 degrees, so we wisely chose to eat inside. \nSince we were too full, we got a preview of the dessert tray for our next visit to Brio, the next time we're in Vegas.  Next time, I'll definitely save room for dessert.  There were individual servings in cute miniature containers, so we're not obligated to have to share large desserts. \nThis place seems to appeal to everyone from the executive, families, girlfriends going out, dinner dates....etc.\nApparently, there are many Brios in many cities.  Too bad there isnt a Brio in the South Bay area!"

I went one early evening  for appies (appetizers) & drinks with my girlfriend and our bill was a mere $30 something when we finished! How can you beat that? We noshed on the Carpaccio, Shrimp cocktail and wine!  Also, the environment is great - I love chilling by the outside bar on the lovely spring / summer evenings... always a Gem in my book!\n\nto be more up to date: Saturday, 29 Jan 2011 was date night - even tho our mood was less than nice... we still enjoyed our meal! :)\n\nyour constant companion,\n\n~dee"

Service by Tamara and the other server's name (sorry I forgot her name) exceeded expectations by our entire family!  Host Sabrina was cheerful and very helpful.  Mgr Nova and assistant mgr Maria was great in helping me plan our event.  The appetizers was yummy and the entrees like filet mignon, tournedos and pastas warrants a return trip to the Brio at Town Square......Mahalo & Aloha!"

It is hard to find seating for happy hours since it's only available by the bar and they do get busy but once you do so worth it. My mom usually gets the peach sangria it's her favorite. I get different things. But we always. Always get the spicy shrimp sauce and eggplant appetizer. It's to die for."

            "review": "This is now my favorite restaurant.  As an overview, the food is excellent, the service is professional and fast, the noise level is a bit loud when crowded (like Cheesecake Factory), the lighting is low, the prices are on the higher side, and you get seated almost immediately with reservations. We came for dinner on two occasions around 6pm both on Saturday.\n\nThe food is one of the highlights.  I recommend the 8oz filet, or the crab and shrimp cakes, or the lamb chops, and the sampler bruschetta, the Tiramisu, traditional cheesecake, and the Torta Di Cioccolata (like a fancy lava cake with Gelato).  I recommend those  since those were the only dishes my wife and I have tried so far and they were very good!  \n\nThe beef and lamb were cooked perfectly to order and seasoned just right.  The roasted veggies that came with our entr\u00e9es were very good although mine were slightly over seasoned. \n\nThe crab and shrimp cakes were awesome...  not too much breading,  not overcooked, and the quality of the seafood was great.  When I took my first bite it reminded me of San Francisco (that where I grew up).  The crispy potatoes that came with this dish was really good and so were the roasted veggies.\n\nThe bruschetta was pretty pricey but was pretty good... if you want to skip the appetizers, that's ok because the rest of the food and experience is more than enough to satisfy and leave you with a smile.\n\nThe desserts are a wonderful sweet topping to the experience here.  The cheesecake, has no graham crust but I guess that's traditional.  It was still really good.  The Tiramisu was just the way I like it.  Anyways...all of the desserts that I've listed above go well with the coffee served here.  FYI when the waiter presents you with the dessert tray, they are presented in little cups, however they do have the regular size versions of those.\n\nThe portions were the right size.  Let me put it this way,  when we left, we did not feel like we overate.\n\nMy wife and I have come here twice in the past two weeks and we love it.  The first time was on a date night and we were very happy.  The second time we came was for my dad's 70th bday.  My parent were happy and my wife and I were happy... Good times!\n\nHope you enjoy it!"

We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess, but that's where any semblance of good service ended. The waiter completely forgot to bring bread and butter and was very difficult to catch when we tried to ask for some. \n\nOur starters came quickly. Our entrees also came quickly. So quickly, in fact, that there was no room on the table for any of them, and we were left scrambling to finish our salads while the busboy wedged in main courses. \n\nI ordered shrimp and lobster ravioli, which I've had previously at the Colorado location. Apparently this one doesn't serve it, so the waiter changed my order to fettuccine and neglected to tell me. I did not want fettuccine. The busboy kept trying to give me the plate I hadn't ordered until, a good 5 minutes later, the waiter showed up and allowed me to order something new. By this point, I was stressed out that the rest of the party would be finished by the time that my meal came out. From what I remember, the roast chicken was good, but since I was trying to inhale it, not much made an impression.\n\nLast but not least, my friend and I ordered the same dessert - creme brulee. My dish clearly hadn't been cleaned properly before the new brulee was made, since it had rubbery, burnt on bits at the bottom on the ramekin. That, however, paled in comparison to my friend.\n\nShe found several different kinds of paper inside her dessert - what looked like a sizeable piece of paper towel and tissue. Like the rest of the night, the waiter never came by to check in, so the issue was never resolved.\n\nEw."

I had one of their dinner specials, the blackened scallops on pesto risotto, and thought it was great. The scallops were large and weren't gritty at all. The risotto was a pretty good consistency (not the best I've ever had, but still good) and had some bold flavors with the pesto and mushrooms. This dish is different than the shrimp and scallop risotto on their daily menu, by the way. \n\nI love the fact that you can get small samplings of their desserts for 2.45 a shot. They're large enough to satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling like you're bingeing on a huge piece of cake or whatever. Most of the desserts are tasty, but not spectacular. The tiramisu and cheesecake are probably the best. I was impressed with the food and the interior of the place. It was a nice casual atmosphere and a relatively inexpensive meal."

However, there were only two place settings at the table and our server never even offered to bring me one or a menu or anything once I sat.\n\nWe ordered our lunches and still no place setting.  When our food came I had to ask for silverware, which he brought, but no napkin, which I had to ask for so he finally brought it.  I had ordered the steak medium rare and it was medium.  I ate it anyway and didn't complain since I wasn't paying for lunch and I knew these ladies were in a hurry.\n\nIf I had to rate Brio on all my visits together, I'd give it 4 stars, but based on this last visit alone I have to be honest and say it was only a 3-star visit."

Upon being seated they took our order then we proceeded to draw on the paper table cloth protector for the table cloth under it. \n\nTheir salads are priced perfectly and are rather large, with quite the selection. 4.95. Bread & Butter (tasty). Sparkling water bottled for 2.95, and the entre which we split for 14.95, I wasn't ooo too hungry but the pasta had a very fresh taste to it. Then for the desserts, around 2 bucks for each one of the crme brles, we ordered the the orange flavor which was extremely sweet and tasty along with their lava cake. \n\nOut waiter was very cool, when he brought the sparkling water to the table he had this fun look on his face, no lime. So I sent it back, he came back 5 minutes later with lime and the water, he ran to CPK to get limes for me, as they had run out 4 hours earlier in the night. \n\nIt's not a quiet romantic place, its very open and the sound is carried throughout the whole place.

I've sampled the Brio dinner menu on numerous occasions and I will not be returning for any entrees.\n\nTHE BAR: I frequent Brio for an entirely different reason: a half indoor / half outdoor bar that brings refinement to the ever frowned upon day drinking. In the Spring & Summer, I can be seen in my designer heels relaxing by the bar with a book, sipping on a glass of over-priced shiraz or moscato on a bright, sunny Tuesday afternoon. Town Square is such a pleasant place. A little pop-up of class down the street from what I consider to be the tackiest shopping mall in Las Vegas (Premium Outlets South). \n\nBAR FOOD: I can't help but jump for joy at cheap food. Brio has a bar menu that's only $2.95 a plate. I've sampled everything on that menu. At 3 bucks a pop, I think I can afford to do so. Serving size is pretty big too. I always order the beef carpaccio: thin-slices of raw beef drizzled with olive oil and other delectables. The flat-breads and ravioli are mediocre. The spicy shrimp is too salty. The burger is a burger. And the ravioli is pretty basic. Then again, at those prices I wouldn't expect anything too fancy.\n\nIn short, olive garden food at cheap prices, alcohol, and a pleasant drinking environment to make your day-drinking the slightest bit more upscale."

I eat there at least once month.\n\nOn Saturday I had brunch with a friend. My server Erika was friendly and informative of the entrees. She was concerned that I was ordering to much food since their portions are large, so she convinced me to split a Cesar salad with my friend instead of ordering one for myself.  \n\nErika was right, it was too much food, I was stuffed after eating my Calamari appetizer,  Cesar Salad, and one omelet with roasted potatoes.  Yes!!! It was to much food. \nThanks Erika for having my back!  I also witnessed Erika's interaction with other patrons, and she was polite, professional and friendly with each encounter. \n\nA few things I would recommend, is to offer refills on beverage service without me having to ask. Trying to flag someone down for a refill for my Arnold Palmer was annoying. In addition, when serving an appetizer for two, please bring serving utensils, it was difficult to serve ourselves without any cutlery or spoons for the sauce.\n\nBrio should have a loyalty program for their regulars offering lower priced cocktails and food. \n\nCheers & Bon Appetite!!"

They are one of the many restaurants in Town Center Square shopping area.\n\nWe arrived a little after 1pm and noticed it was busy, lots of people were standing around waiting.  So we went inside and I asked the hostess how long the wait was and was told 15-20 minutes.  She asked for my name and phone number and we went back outside and browsed some nearby shops.  We came back and sat outside at a bench by the restaurant and still didn't hear anything.  I checked my phone frequently and made sure I had my ringer on. More time passed, nearly an hour and we went inside to see how long the wait would be.  The hostess looked up my name on a computer and another hostess immediately showed us to a table.  We realize it was busy BUT if we hadn't checked back with the hostess we would still be outside waiting to hear my phone ring.  So why did the hostess bother to get my phone number if they weren't going to call in the first place?  We felt our time was wasted waiting around for a call.  Maybe they should invest in those pager things that other restaurants give out that buzz and light up when your table is ready.\n\nThe food was pretty good.  We ordered lobster bisque, my boyfriend had an omelet and I had the stuffed french toast with berries.  Our waiter was an older gentleman who picked up on the fact that my boyfriend was pissed when we first arrived.  He was very attentive and had a calm and playful manner.\n\nSo I would give the food 4 stars, but because of the hostesses lack of hospitality and indifference I have to give Brio Tuscan Grille 3 stars."

The feeling I got as soon as I walked in and asked a simple question was as they were doing customers a favor by letting you in. \n\nI choose to ignore their lack of courtesy, asked for patio which faced towards Victoria Secrets and behind their bar, they said it was closed although there we people sitting there. Then they took us instead to another outsite section which basically had no one sitting in the area.\n\nI simply left this restaurant and inmediately ran into California Kitchen, which had a much better attitute towards customers.\n\nMaybe some badic manners trainning would help this hostes at the entrance representing Brio."

This shocked me and put me off quite a bit. I'm 100% Italian and for an Italian restaurant not to have traditional pizzas is just a huge no-no. Like a burger joint that doesn't serve burgers and fries. However, they do have 4 choices of American style flat-breads that can be ordered on pizza dough. But it's just not the same. \n\nI've been here before and the other few dishes I've tried are very tasty. Although, I do not consider this to be an Italian restaurant. More of an American take on Italian cuisine. Still good but not what I was looking for."

So the shuttle dropped us off here before the flight informing us we had about an hour and a half before pick up. We were seated and then given a ticket receipt to show our server and then in turn order from their prix fixe menu. Our server some young guy was obviously annoyed by our dinner package and kept making it clear that gratuity was not included the deal. For drinks I ordered a bellini and for dinner we had a caesar salad & a wedge salad , along with their lasagna & a pasta dish I can't remember. The white sauce with the lasagna was a bit strange since I'm used to red sauces but it was good, everything was good. The restaurant seemed like a fancier version of olive garden but I enjoyed Brio's much more. The server was the only thing that made this visit unpleasant, his presence was scarce and I knew dinner included a dessert which he claimed to forget but seemed like he just wanted us out. Would like to return and experience a better dining experience."

We were starving, so we decided to look for somewhere to eat afterwards. Using my trusty Yelp app, I found that Brio Tuscan Grille was one of the highest rated restaurants in the plaza that was still open at that hour, so off we went!\n\nThe ambience and decor of Brio Tuscan Grille felt very classy and upscale. We weren't too dressed up, so we felt slightly out of place. However, our service remained top notch, and everyone was very nice, friendly, and attentive. Brio Tuscan Grille is a great place I'd recommend if you want a hearty Italian dinner. My boyfriend and I loved everything we ordered, which was the following:\n\n-Roasted Garlic, Spinach, and Artichoke Dip: One of my favorite appetizers, so I usually always order this.. and Brio's is definitely one of my favorites I've had so far! The Parmesan flatbread they provide for dipping tasted so cheesy, crisp, and perfect. It was a good blend of flavors with the spinach dip, which was neither too salty or bland. Usually restaurants serve tortilla chips with spinach/artichoke dip, so I thought Brio's upgrade to parmesan flatbread was a very nice touch. Highly recommend!\n- Lobster Bisque: Very creamy and filling. The lobster bisque I've had in the past had a stronger tomato, tangy taste. Brio's version is definitely more creamy and thick. While I liked it, it was probably too heavy to eat in conjunction with the spinach/artichoke dip.\n- Pasta BRIO: I honestly don't remember this dish too well, since it's been months. However, we ordered this to share per recommendation of our server. I do remember the sauce being very savory and delicious, and I most likely enjoyed it. It's supposedly their signature dish, so I assume it's one of their more popular pastas.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my first dining experience at Brio Tuscan Grille. I usually don't like eating at Italian restaurants, because I'm never blown away by their dishes. However, Brio exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the area. If you're fan of spinach/artichoke dip, definitely order this as well!"

I left feeling pretty disappointed. \n\nI don't like waitstaff who start out very nice and then snub you when you just order an appetizer and drinks. It was lunchtime, not prom night. Geezus. Our waiter's attitude changed instantly when we ordered a bruschetta, kids meal and drinks. He actually said, \"That's it?\"  He never came back to check on our drinks or to clear dishes. He was in an ass-kissing conversation with the table across from us when he dropped off the check, it was an absolute after thought. \n\nThe bruschetta sampler was delicious, and my daughter liked her kids lasagna, but I won't be coming back thanks to the service. I am not willing to risk putting our group of friends & family through crappy service for an expensive, special occasion dinner. \n\nI understand that society believes it acceptable to tip off the dollar amount of a meal. This is why waiters get annoyed when you don't spend the big bucks, I get it. I, however, tip off the quality of the service. I believe a customer who orders an ice tea deserves the same great service as a customer who orders a $500 meal. \n\nSorry, Brio. Epic FAIL."

I have been wanting to try this place out, and considering it was our cheat day, I was really excited to have some good pasta. We ordered the caesar salad, lobster bisque, lasagna, the campanelle carbonara, and the tiramisu and some fresh fruit for dessert. The Caesar was okay, lobster bisque was mediocre at best (very generic tasting), my son liked the lasagna, but the carbonara was just waaaayyy too salty. I thought at first that the Parmesan made it salty, but even the pasta in the very bottom of the dish was salty. I literally couldn't eat more than a quarter of the dish because of it. The tiramisu was okay, at least it washed away the saltiness from the pasta dish. I was so bummed because I've been looking forward to coming here, and actually having some good pasta, and just regretted my decision of choosing brio over yard house or bone fish grill. I know this is only our first visit, but I am sort of hesitant to come back here again since they messed up something that was supposed to be a staple of theirs. On the bright side, our server was nice and on top of things so that adds another star to my review."

On top of that they got my daughters meal wrong, which was sent back and took forever for them to make.  But the flavor was definitely sub-standard.

We had a few drinks and I have to say their Raspberry Mojito is a must try!\n\nWe started with the Carpaccio appetizer and it was absolutely heavenly. Like I'm crazing it right now at 8:00AM just writing about it good.\n\nFor our main course we had the Steak salad and the Salmon salad. Both were ginormous portions and incredibly tasty. Neither of us were able to finish them and we left incredibly satisfied!\n\nThis will definitely be a go to for girls night!"

The service was amazing and funny (like comedy hour) the staff communicated well together and I loved every minute of this experience. I ordered the Salmon dish with pasta, which was to die for. I was able to finish my  entire plate and not waste it or take leftovers. Just enough to feel delightfully full. The tastes and flavors were like a symphony in my mouth. I will be going back  here again and again and again.........."

The aromas make you extra hungry, the dark lighting is just right & the food is always great. \nI haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy & whenever I bring people over who are first timers they become instant fans. I also need to mention that they have a fantastic happy hour even though I didn't participate in this particular visit. Some of my favorite items are; the balsamic strawberry salad, the lobster bisque & the margherita flat bread. \nThe service has also been great on every visit so I highly recommend this place. Outdoor dining is also a must on nice days or evenings."

I ordered a prosciutto sandwich and a lobster bisque soup. The sandwich did not have any prosciutto on it and was mostly slimy cheese and the soup was extremely salty and I think there was a hair in it. A friend of mine is vegan and ordered a plain salad with just vegetables in it and they charged her $20 for it. She brought it up to the waitress and she said it was because it was a modified salmon salad... But she didn't have salmon in it which is the most expensive part. We also waited 40 minutes for our food and it wasn't even right. It came with items she didn't ask for and it took an additional ten minutes for the waitress to bring her side of salad dressing. It's a shame that the food isn't great because the place is really nice and has patio seating."

While our waitress was very nice, she was forever missing in action and when she would take our table of 8 drink orders, she'd return with only 5-6 drinks, the others would sit thirsty. We'd flag her down and politely ask if our drinks were coming and she's look through her notepad and look confused, then 10 minutes later deliver our remaining drinks to our parched friends. Salads and appetizers ordered, again, a salad is missing and as two of the three appetizers are brought to the table, the third elusive appetizer never arrives. Meal orders placed, all miraculously arrive. I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo, which, by its name alone signifies it is a spicy dish. Ugh, no. Quite flavorless honestly. Bland as the napkin on my lap. My husband ordered the Under the Brick (or something like that) Chicken, he said it was not very good, again, lacking in flavor and depth, he was disappointed. Other items ordered was steak which was said to taste very gamey and sat on the plate next to the watery mashed potatoes. Lobster and Shrimp raviolis were said to be okay, but not fantastic. The friend who ordered the Blackened Tilapia said it was very good, however the plate next to her was the Chicken Milanese was not good at all, overly salted and dry. \nOur check took forever to be delivered. Once we paid it was $113 per couple, including a cocktail each. I usually am not super high maintenance, but I felt like I had to beg for a refill of water or the check. The food was not toothsome as one would hope. Big let down."

Brio's Happy Hour is seat-your-self only, and unfortunately you can only experience it if you're seated at the bar, couches, or the tall tables located near the bar, and when my friend and I arrived all seats were taken. \n\nFOOD\nMy friend and I ordered and shared the Bruschetta Quattro, which is perfect for two people since there are four different bruschettas and two for each person. One of my favorite was the bruschetta with the melted mozzarella and sun dried tomato; I just loved  the simple combination of melted cheese and tomato on toasted bread. My least favorite was the asparagus with mozzarella cheese and some kind of sweet sauce that could've been omitted. Not a bad appetizer for sharing, but I don't think it's worth the $14. \n\nRESTAURANT\nWe were seated outdoors by the sidewalk. Fortunately for us it was a lovely evening to be dining outdoors. I can't recommend that this spot would be perfect for a date, unless your idea of romance entails the roars of motorcycle engines and observing the same guy walk around the block talking loudly to \"someone\" on his bluetooth ear piece. Dining outside with a group of friends and family members might be more ideal.\n\nSERVICE\nConsidering how busy it was that evening, we were seated within five minutes from the time we arrived. Our waitress did a decent job taking care us.\n\nOVERALL\nI might return here in the future to try their Happy Hour specials, but I don't think I would try anything off of their regular menus again."

Went for brunch on a Sunday and our group was seated fairly quickly. The clean and beautiful decor captured my eye. There was a bridal shower going on next to our table and they were taken care of nicely by the servers.\n\nOur waitress and waiter were attentive and friendly. Started off with bread and butter, would have liked some oil and vinegar because that makes me think Italian. After looking at their menu for 15 minutes, because I couldn't decide from all the amazing choices, I ordered the Tuscany Harvest Salad. Came with grilled chicken,  mushrooms, bacon, almonds, Gorgonzola cheese, apples, dried cranberries, crispy lavoush, and Tuscan dressing. It was DELICIOUS! \n\nI still had room for dessert and their dessert platter had a nice variety so I went with the BRIO's Famous Cheesecake which was creamy and topped with caramalized sugar and creme anglaise. Every bite I took made me fall in love all over again. \n\nTheir brunch menu has some great choices and I would not mind returning to this place or hosting a dinner party. Good choice, glad we yelped it. It's located in a town center so parking can be a pain but there are plenty of shops to walk around in."

I had been looking forward to trying Brio for a long time as I'm frequently in Town Square. \nWhen we first entered, I really liked the decor! It was very majestic and beautiful - kind of reminded me of Caesar's Palace!\nWe immediately ordered drinks. My best friend decided to order a Bloody Mary while I went with my favorite extra dirty martini. Both cocktails were disappointing. \nOur server then brought out several baskets of warm bread which was delicious and probably one of my favorite parts of the meal!\nOur group ordered several appetizers to share - the calamari and the spicy shrimp & eggplant. Both dishes were excellent. \nSince my cocktail was unenjoyable, I decided to play it safe and order a glass of wine to complement my meal. I knew that I was going to go with seafood so I went with the Sauvignon Blanc from Italy which was an excellent choice! It was a very crisp and refreshing wine.\nFor the main course, I went with the Pesce Piccata (wild caught cod), which unfortunately lacked flavor, was rather dry, & overall disappointing. The angel hair pasta that came with it also tasted somewhat undercooked. My best friend ordered the evening's special - sea bass - which was delicious!\nFinally, we ordered a few desserts that we all shared at the table. I had the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was fantastic!\nOverall, my favorite parts of the meal were the bread, appetizers, desserts, and overall ambiance. The service was very good too and our server was polite and knowledgeable. \nI plan on returning to try other items and specifically to try their happy hour!"

They are a tad pricey, in my opinion, but alot of fancier Italians places just are. The best part of Brio is that it is a place that is both classy and casual.\n\nWe ordered a couple drinks which I don't even remember their names. Lol.

Why the bartender thought I might care if the Bellini was authentic or not I do not know but she was right.  And it was the first step in stellar service that continued through the process of making the drinks, taking our food order and until the time we walked out at the end of our meal.  \n\nNot only was the service great, the food exceeded our expectations, and the setting was lovely, hence the four stars.  \n\nBrio is part of a small chain and as a rule we avoid chains, in particular when they involve 'staged opulence' interiors as here.  Different strokes for different folks and we simply lean to smaller, privately owned places with less flash..  But a local woman we met at Aria and with whom we discussed food (favorite topic for her too) recommended Brio and thought we'd be pleasantly surprised.  So in need of a late lunch, we headed to Town Center Mall (Whole Foods is also located here) and Brio.\n\nWe split the barbequed chicken flatbread and it was tasty...crispy thin crust, delicious sauce with just the right amount of chipotle, white meat chicken, feta and cilantro.  Served very hot from the oven, it was a great partner for the refreshing, well made mojitos..  We finished up by sharing the creme brulee trio, relying on the recommendation of another yelp reviewer, and thought all three brulee options (cleverly presented in demitasse cups) were good for flavor even if the sugar toppings had lost their crispness.\n\nOur food and two cocktails were about $35 so a decent price.  \n\nBased on this single experience, we would return to eat at a Brio Tuscan Grille again if we find one at some other point in our travels."

Whether you're in the mood for a hearty Italian dinner or something light and fresh, Brio does not disappoint! \n\nThe menu was slightly different the last time we went. We had the roasted red pepper bruschetta. The balsamic glaze is amazing. I had the grilled salmon fresca. It was definitely fresh and extremely delicious!"

It was beautiful. The food and service were top notch.  One dish stood out,  a vodka pasta plate was a big hit! \nA very special praise to Nova the director of banquets.  A very sweet, understanding and helpful young man.  He was there for me when I was breaking down and nervous about the party. He is just perfect at what he does! \nThank you for a perfect day! \nSandra Perreault and family"

SO GOOD. this is a solid 4.5 but i rounded up because of our experience there\n\nthis was the place for our last night in vegas dinner and wow was it such a good choice.\n\nlocation & pricing: the pricing is a bit on the higher side, but its totally worth every penny. the location of it is in the heart of the shopping center or square or whatever its called.\n\natmosphere: this place inside and out - was so nice. they had nice couches outside, and a plush entryway, and a wonderful setting on the inside. it was a pretty ornate looking interior. dim lights, curtains, rich carpets.\n\ntaste: AHHH SOSOSO GOOD. we ordered the brio's bruschetta trio, and since we didn't know what to order, we asked our waiter for recommendations. what great recommendations that STEVE gave us. we got the bistecca alla fiorentina, artichoke encrusted beef medallions, pasta brio, and the mushroom ravioli al forno. it was soooo delicious. perfect seasoning, perfect spice & flavor. oh and the complimentary bread!! we had crispy and soft bread. \n\nso we did order the brio's bruschetta trio, but we didn't actually get to try it - steve totally forgot about it and cancelled the bruschetta and offered us the dolchino sampler: peach cobbler, mocha mousse?, creme brulee, cheesecake with a raspberry sauce, applebread, milk chocolate cake with caramel, and tiramisu. the only bad thing is that it was a little \"too much of a good thing\" scenario. while it was so decadent and wonderful, it was a little too rich to finish everything even amongst the four of us (one guy and three girls)\n\nservice: STEVE. impeccable. we even got his card - he works everyday except sunday (to watch football), and when we are back (and WE WILL!) we're going to make sure in hell that we sit at steve's table."

First impression was an arrogant hostess who was more concerned with marking off her floor chart or station map than greeting me. I was sat and ordered the Lobster Bisque which was amazing, the bread was awesome. My server Jade was excellent as well. I ordered the Veal Marsala and it was extremely bland and tasteless. Not even the sauce could save it, Marsala usually has a nice, nutty flavor. It had no flavor at all, very disappointing. After seeing the decor and tasting the bread and the Bisque I was expecting a great meal, it was far from it. A microwave meal has more flavor....."

That being said, I was ultimately surprised when our waitress in the bar section was a little too sarcastic or trying too hard to be nice, like it was physically hurting her to do so... She explained our menus like we looked confused as to what she even had handed us.  I was turned off immediately by how apathetic she was being.  We were done with our meal and two other waiters asked us if we wanted the bill.  15 mins go by, four servers stood by the checkout while we painstakingly waited at our table.  We honestly could have just got up and walked out with no discrepancies...  Also I bartend, my fianc\u00e9 is a competitive bartender as well so we know professionalism.  A older bartender got woodford reserve out and left it on the bar for 5mins... He free handed the sketchiest old fashioned I've ever seen... And then did not put the bottle back in its place.  The second bartender came around and poured water yet did nothing about the bottle that was still out.  The original tender passed it four more times without putting it back.  He also proceeded to stick an unopened straw into a shot he poured but had found something in the drink that wasn't supposed to be there. It was an unpleasant experience."

            "review": "This is the short version of the longest review ever written...\n\nI got married in Vegas June 20, 2008 and chose Brio for the after ceremony (reception?) dinner. I planned my entire wedding over the course of 3 weeks remotely from Colorado, so I didn't realize Brio was in a mall. I'm sure I could have figured that out if I'd read more reviews...\n\nI ended up loving Brio! When we first arrived, we were told that our private room was not available due to the air conditioning unit going out inside and the room temp hovering around 90 degrees. I think when something goes wrong with a major reservation, the way the staff treats the issue is a true sign of their customer service skillz. Well folks, the staff at this Brio location has mad skillz, the skillz that pay the billz even!! They apparently left me a voicemail letting me know of the issue earlier in the night, but for some crazy reason, could be that I was exchanging vows and bling with the love of my life, I didn't get the msg. So anyway, they were very apologetic and seemed almost let down themselves that I didn't have the perfect room for my dinner on my wedding day....it was really okay though because I was at a very zen place right then and they were so nice about it. \n\nSo, onto the meal. The staff had curtained off half of the regular dining area so we still had a private dinner, it was just a little louder around us than it would have been behind closed doors. Brio comped us two bottles of Champagne for our toast due to the room being unavailable and Chris, who was absolutely sweet and could not have been more attentive, waited on us hand and foot during our meal. He also provided sparkling orange juice for the kids and my sister in law who is expecting for the toast. The champagne was good, the bartender even came in and helped us pick out a few bottles of wine to drink with our meal which was nice. We all ordered right off the menu since there were only 14 of us. My son and I both had the Salmon which was served on parmesan crusted tomatoes and with shoestring potatoes, so delicious! My husband and step-son had the lamb chops and mashed potatoes - I don't like lamb but I tasted the mashers and they were seriously the best I've ever had. All in all, the food was scrumptious and prompt and the service was outstanding. \n\nThe day after the wedding, I had a message from the manager at Brio, Kenna, that someone in my wedding party left something at the restaurant and she needed my address to send it to me. I waited a few days to receive whatever it was that was left there after I got back to CO. To my surprise, a package arrived with a letter from Chris and the staff at Brio thanking me for choosing them for my reception dinner. Included was the cork from our champagne bottle, that day's newspaper and the table covers that we had written on in crayon while enjoying our meal. So thoughtful and cute, the staff at Brio going above and beyond made the experience of my Vegas wedding that much more enjoyable! Grazie!"

Me and two coworkers went here after work on Friday around 1:30pm and we just had sangria and appetizers. We sat outside in Town Square because the weather was beautiful. We ordered the white peach sangria, which was excellent beyond belief. I'm typically a red sangria person because the others are too sweet but this was just perfect. I ordered the steak bruschetta. My goodness. It was so awesome. It had a touch of Gorgonzola cheese on it but it wasn't too strong as it sometimes can be. It had arugula and Parmesan. The steak was so tender and flavorful. I was legitimately impressed. \n\nOur service was very good and attentive as well and she split the check three ways for us which I appreciated...considering this is sometimes a painful task. \n\nI was glad we sat outside where is was quiet and shaded. I saw a glimpse of the inside and it just wasn't inviting. It looked dark and loud."

He's a simple kind of guy and way pickier than our daughter, but he cleared his plate with \"Wow\" in between bites.

We were hungry so we chose to brave the elements. It was a bit chilly - to be certain. We were glad for our jackets and I ordered a hot chocolate.\n\nThe decor was nice, outdoor tables could maybe use a few more heaters on the cold evenings. We loved the idea of the fire pit though it's not super comfortable for dining - better for drinks/appetizers I suspect.\n\nWe started with the ravioli appetizer. It was quite good, though perhaps could have used just a tad more tomato/marinara sauce.\n\nI ordered the steak and I have to say it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, much larger than I expected, perfectly seasoned.  Nicely done sides of mashed potatoes and vegetables.  Really outstanding. The rest of the table seemed to enjoy their dishes as well.\n\nService was friendly, professional and attentive.  He made a small mistake on the check in not crediting our free appetizer coupon but immediately recognized and fixed it with an apology.  \n\nThe only downside I can think of was it being a bit chilly, but we can't fault Brio for the weather. Look forward to going back on our next trip to Vegas."

It was around noon on a Friday, and since there was a wait to sit inside we decided to sit on the patio. \n\nThe overall attitude of the hostess worried me a bit... She wasn't welcoming, did not try to engage us in any conversation, walked way ahead of us, and did not check to see if we were ok with the table she put us at. And we weren't, as soon as our waiter came to take our drink orders we asked to be moved to an area that was slightly shaded. \n\nAfter checking over the menu I was unable to decide so I decided to ask  our waiters to help. We had multiple waiters, one was being trained by the other. Between the snooty hostess and trainee-waiter this could have been a disastrous lunch but thankfully the waiters  did a great job together. They convinced me to to try the citrus garden salad with shrimp. My friend had  the mezza chicken under the brick. \n\nThe bread did not come out until after our food, but our food did come out pretty quickly. My salad was huge, had lots of perfectly cooked shrimp and the linguine was surprisingly good, which made me happy since I was worried I wouldn't like noodles on a salad. The dressing was a light lemon vinaigrette, and the dried cranberries and pecans were nice compliments to the cilantro and peppers. \n\nBased on how quickly she devoured it, I think the mezza chicken under the brick was pretty good as well! \n\nTotal damage for our 2 lunches and 2 ice teas was right around $30 before tip. I am looking forward to visiting Brio again during happy hour."

Brio, Monday to Thursday, 9pm to close at the bar, $2.95 per Tuscan Taster, which are supposed to be appetizers but are the size of entrees. $5 Martini Thursdays can apply to the Tuscan Taster Happy Hour special, and if it's not Thursday, but you have a card to show that you're in the food and beverage industry, you can get $5 martinis even if it's not Thursday. \n\nThey used to have the Steak Bruschetta, but they took that off the menu and replaced it with the Mozzarella Red Pepper Bruschetta with Arugula. Anyway, to the food.\n\nBrio Burger: ordered this at medium, came with crisp chips and a nice plain brioche bun. The meat was delicious and fresh. The chips were really crispy. Dip this in the tomato sauce of the\n\nRavioli Caprese: 3 pieces of ravioli, circular, with cheese topped with basil and tomatoes. \n\nBeef Carpaccio: paper-thin slices of raw beef (about 6) with a little aioli, capers, some leafy greens, and a pizza-shaped slice of crisp flatbread. Everything was fresh and tasted great.\n\nSausage and Pepperoni Flatbread: Crisp flatbread baked in a wood-fire oven comes topped with bits of sausage and pepperoni cut into four triangles.\n\nFood deserves 4 stars. Service from Nicole M. deserves 5 stars as we only had happy hour items and raspberry iced tea, but she still treated us like any other guest, and ambience and happy hour menu deserve 5 stars. I have been to Brio Tuscan Grille about 5 times for their night time happy hour.\n\nGive this place a shot if you haven't tried it yet for happy hour. You'll be surprised - pleasantly while enjoying the view of the Colosseum and the background Italian music that so dearly reminds me of Firenze, Italia."

If you arrive at happy hour, the deals at the bar are amazing.  $3.95 for 3 deep fried cheese raviolis for example.  They also serve mojitos and sangria on top of all the regular bar drinks.  For dinner, their pasta is good.  I had the lobster bisque and it was good, but I enjoyed their tomato bisque even better... but I don't think it's always available.  Overall, it's a classy place at a just above average price range.  Most dishes are $10 - $20.  I think it's a step above Olive Garden and Macaroni Grille..."

I like the beef carpaccio, ravioli (crispy with a yummy marinara sauce/ tomato relish), the sliders look good as well.  \n\nThe outdoor patio has a nice ambiance and a great spot for convos. There's section of sofa with a fireside as well but is normally taken up by a crowd.  A nice and relaxing restaurant to hang out (speaking of the bar and patio area)."

We (son, his father, and I) arrived at 6:00pm and the patio area was packed when we walked by, but we were promptly seated inside at a spacious booth.  I told the hostess that we were celebrating the teenager's birthday and her immediate reaction was, \"Oh, you didn't tell us at the front--let me get his birthday card!\"  What?  So, she came right back with a birthday card that was obviously pre-handwritten for such occasions, but it did include a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit--nice touch.  The kind lady also informed us that the birthday boy was also going to get a free dessert of his choosing with a lit candle, but that there would be no singing--yay!  My son picked the perfect place for his birthday!  We've been to Brio several times and this is one of the reasons--they give great customer service.  Our waitress was attentive, we always had plenty of bread and drink refills, and were satisfied with our dishes:  Chicken Under the Brick, Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto, and Grilled Shrimp & Orzo.  The kid chose the Chocolate Lava cake and free dessert is always delicious!  If you want to get the most for your money on your birthday, check out Brio:  great food, fantastic service, and freebies!"

Carpacchio as usual, Burger (perfectly medium-rare), Crab cakes and Fritatta for me... all with a glass of Chianti.\n\nWe were in and out literally in 30 minutes. Service was timely and attentive.

Sounds petty but it left a bad impression being that it was our first time there. The waitress walked over to check on us and I said nicely \" What's the managers name the woman who's been walking over to these tables next to us acknowledging every other table besides ours? Is it because everyone else that's here is Caucasian and we're not? \" She said oh I'm sorry I'm sure that's not what it is, I know being minority it feels like a racial thing sometimes but I'm sure that's not what it is.\" I made it very clear that I never ever feel that way because I have a multi cultural family. She asked if I wanted her to address the issue and have her walk over and I refused it.

The ambiance was perfect Sunday, even though we only had a lunch hour instead of the normal brunch experience.  Service was quick, and we had delicious bread and artisan crackers on our table before we could even order.\nThe brunch food is awesome.  I had my heart set on the vegetable omelet with egg whites, mushrooms, etc. (I was sold with the mushrooms) and my darling wife had the Sicilian Omelet, with ham, bacon, sausage, etc. - and the star of the whole meal by far was the tomato compote on top of her omelet.  That sauce made us think of Italy, and made us want to come back to try some pasta here, because it was the most flavorful, full-bodied tomato sauce we've ever had. It totally took over the omelet, but in a darn good way.\nMy white omelet was awesome, and I would get it again in a heartbeat.  But I'll try getting the tomato compote on it...  And maybe the brunch potatoes, which are also sublimely well done, not too crisp or soggy, not too salty or bland, just yum all around."

            "review": "I am not especially jazzed to be writing a review of Brio as it is more of a chain establishment; however, it has a couple of things going for it that elevate it a couple of inches above Wal-Mart, so I am doing it.\n\nThese things are atmosphere and tiny desserts. Let's start with atmosphere: the place is giant and perhaps bordering on tacky, but at least they tried, and they have probably the largest, most impressive patio in Las Vegas featuring not only tables but love seats and plenty of umbrellas. It must be at least a solid two blocks of outdoor experience. Of course, all of this is undermined by the fact that Town Square sits solidly underneath the flat path for McCarran, so every ten minutes you have a 757 flying over and rendering conversation impossible for about a minute. After about 15 minutes of this, my mom commented, \"I hope they got a good deal on this property.\" I would say this makes what could be a five star atmosphere a three star experience, possibly even two if you are sensitive to jet engines.\n\nYet, they have one more trick up their patio: tiny desserts. Really, this is a brilliant idea, and I am not sure why more restaurants do not do this. Brio offers six miniature desserts. They come in what is best described as a sweet shot glass, which is probably the volume of 3 shot glasses. Each mini-sweetie only costs $2.45! My mom and I had the Peachberry Crostada topped with pecan streusel, vanilla bean gelato and Melba sauce. My mom wanted to order five more, and I can't blame her.\n\nWe both had salad and soup for our lunch, and those were done well. They also have a nice happy hour, but you have to sit at the bar to get those deals. I recommend just creating your own secret happy hour: grab a table on the patio and order $2.45 desserts until your sweet tooth begs for mercy. It's a good plan."

I am a huge fan of spinach and artichoke dip and this is definitely one of my favorite. \nThe complimentary bread they give is also so good! They give you soft, warm bread, and cripsy flatbread with balsamic vinegar and wine...oh so good. I would just go for this!\nTheir caesar salad and Brio chopped salad was good, nothing really special, but they both did taste very good.\nI had the Chipotle Chicken & Bacon Panini with charred tomato, carmelized onions, spicy chipotle mayonnaise, Fontina, Boursin and Applewood bacon. The Bacon was superb! The sandwich overall was perfect! I would get this next time I go to lunch.\nFor dinner, I had the Grilled Salmon. I am also a fan of salmon, and the salmon was cooked to perfection for me. It came with Romano crusted tomatoes, citrus pesto, asparagus and crispy shoestring potatoes. \nFor dessert, I had their tiramisu. It was okay, nothing worth mentioning about it. \nThe service was great both times I went and I loved the decor around the entire restaurant most of all. It really made me feel like I was in another world, not just in another LV restaurant. \nIf you go to Las Vegas, this is a must try for some good Italian food and not as expensive as on the strip.

Keep in mind I only had 15 adults. When we finally did get the food it was excellent. Based on this experience I would dine there with a small group of people,  but hosting a party is not there strong suit. Additionally,  I never met the Banquet Manager or the Assistant Banquet Manager.

They were polite and welcoming.  A very short time afterwards a basket of bread was dropped off.  This is the kicker.  15-20 mins later we were greeted by our server.  I know this because a party of 10 was sat after us and proceeded to receive their first course before we even had water glasses or even a simple \"I'll be right with you\".  We noticed a manager walk by us 4 times and didn't notice we hadn't even been given waters.  The busser that had given us our bread must not have brought it to the server's attention.  At this time we were taking bets on the over under on how much longer it'd be before we were greeted.  So we got out our stopwatch and started clocking it from that moment.  Just from that moment we had an elapsed 4 mins.  I unfortunately lost the bet.  I had taken the over which was another 8 mins.  The meal went smoothly from that point on.  The chicken limone was amazing and my friend's filet was also enjoyed.  \n\nAfter a bottle of true grit petite Syrah, a salad course, main course, and dessert we left satisfied with our meal.

EXCEPT our last visit when the \"chef just didn't feel like making it...\"  Not out of ingredients, not we just can no longer offer it since it is not on the menu, etc.  The waiter, who is very cool, said the chef was just being moody and said he didn't want to offer it anymore or \"didn't feel like making it today\"\n\nWRONG ANSWER buddy...I'm sure it means nothing cause the place does have great food and is always busy but you just don't do that to your regular customers.  Food is a 5, Chef is a 0!!!"

We went on a Sunday night and they seemed to be pretty busy but their service was very fast. We got our drinks and appetizer right away. Our food came not too long after that. Which was great! Usually places being that busy take quite awhile. \n\nWe ordered calamari as an appetizer and blue moon and moscato for our drinks. My bf wasn't please with the blue moon coming from the bottle. But I was very pleased with the moscato and the calamari was good. For our entrees, I ordered lobster and shrimp fettuccine and my bf had the 8oz filet mignon. Although, my bf was disappointed that the steak was almost smaller than my fist.. both entrees were delicious!\n\nWould come here again whenever I crave Italian!"

Thank goodness we did because the wait would have been over an hour!!  And even with a reservation they sat us 15 mins later.....\n\nWe got water and menus promptly and decided to order the pasta tuscano, the vodka pasta, the shrimp and eggplant appetizer and the beef Carpaccio.  Food came out relatively quickly and we got everything at once.  The beef Carpaccio was plated beautifully.  It was in this gigantic plate that took up the whole table space.  Beef was sliced super thin and stuck to the plate.  You can't even pick up a piece of it without tearing.  I don't know if that's good or bad.   But it was delicious and fresh.  The eggplant and shrimp was probably my favorite dish.  A little salty but the eggplant was perfectly fried and crispy.  It was not mushy at all even though it was smothered in sauce.\n\nAs for the pastas, the noodles were cooked well.  It wasn't aldente and I actually liked that it was softer.  The tuscano pasta is Bolognese made with sausage instead of beef.  I was disappointed because it tasted overly cheesy and the sausage is overwhelming.  I think I like the original version with beef better.  The vodka pasta was very good.  It was ricotta stuffed pasta in a creamy tomato sauce.  The ricotta was light and airy and the tart tomato sauce balanced it well.\n\nOverall, this is not a place I will come to again on my own.  Its a nice ambiance, but too expensive for the quality of food.  Our waiter was also super FORGETFUL.  Had the ask for water, plate, fork, check TWICE."

It was a little chilly at 11am, so they were kind enough to bring a heat lamp over to our table. We ordered so much. We started with the Bruschetta sampler. There wasn't a bad one in the dish!! I think for each of us, this stood out as the winner. We ordered peach sangria, mimosa and coffee. The coffee was average, drinks were above average in quality and alcohol ratio. \nI ordered a Greek chopped salad. It was inexpensive and hit the mark. My friend ordered a burger and fries. She said everything was great, my other friend ordered breakfast- eggs, toast, potatoes. She said the potatoes were pretty super. Then we finished it off with mars Capone cheesecake. This was everything I had expected it would be when they showed & explained it to us. \nEverything about this place works for me. Really a perfect place for brunch! Again..... do the Bruschetta!!!!"

We started with their white peach sangria and beef carpaccio, spicy shrimp & eggplant, and four cheese pizzeta.  We thought that the food wouldn't be enough, but boy were we wrong!  The portions are HUGE for the price.  One appetizer for each of us would have been enough.  The flat bread pizza was good and paired well with our sangrias.  But our favorite dishes are the spicy shrimp & eggplant and beef carpaccio.  The spicy shrimp was laid on top of the eggplant with this creamy sauce ladled around it.  The beef carpaccio is definitely a star all on its own.  Its such a steal to get a huge plate full of thinly sliced beef for less than 4 bucks.  I've carpaccio at sushi restaurants, but this was way different.  The beef melted in your mouth and I could've probably scarfed down the whole plate if I wasn't sharing it.  \n\nMy first time there did not disappoint.  I'll definitely be back for a beef carpaccio of my own and try some other things on the menu."

The entrees were delish but my dining partner didn't like the lasagne due to the fact that it did come in a cream sauce but I thought it was great because it wasn't thick & lasagne noodle-y.  My veal milanese classico was tasty & is lemony with (in a good way).  Our waiter, Allen, was fine, not weird as was mentioned in previous reviews but forgot to fill our water & ice tea.

Let's say B+.  Stuffed peppers.  Best part of the meal.\n\nEntrees:  This was where it just got bad.  Two terrible entrees.  Mezza Chicken Limone tasted like I was eating straight egg.  Zero flavor unless you ate a moutful of salt and capers.\n\nDo yourself a favor, if you want a chain Italian restaurant in Las Vegas, head on over to the Macaroni Grill and save yourself some time and money.

Happily not much of wait at all most part soon walked in got seated. They had live band playing outside that night outside on the patio. So the place had nice lively vibe too it especially around the patio/bar area. So I do need too come back because like the whole outdoor, open fire pit, and HH prices looks like steal. \n\nI came in for dinner with the family. We ordered two appetizers too share start artichoke spinach dip and calamari. Both really good. I enjoyed about the artichoke spinach dip was the fact it came with lavosh crackers rather then typical beard. It gave the dish another spin with the crispy lavosh topped with nice hot dip on top! It was nice creamy texture, vibrant green color, and great flavor. The calamari was solid nice crispy moist hot on in the inside comes with two different sauce one traditional marinade sauce and other not sure. Each sauce paired nice with the crispy calamari. Both were great starter before our entrees.\n\nI had the chicken milanese. Break it down same as chicken parmesan. The chicken breast had perfect golden crust on the outside nice crispy and cooked perfectly on the inside! It was nice HOT and moist throughout! It served on bed of noodles cooked perfectly and saute with in some kind of butter sauce. Outside around the bed of pasta had red sauce. I really enjoyed everything on the plate nothing left too show!\n\nThe atmosphere feel like upscale version of Olive Garden. The prices are not that really upscale might be slightly more expensive then Olive Garden. It great alternative if looking for Italian food. The staff there from time walked in too our server all greeted us with smile, warm welcome, and fabulous job! If in the near the area would stop by again."

One of the best I've had; the ones I usually get are too salty and lacking in flavor, but this one was perfect.\n\nAs an entree I got the Pasta Pesto, my father got the Pasta Brio (his go to), and our friends got the Ravioli di Bello, and Balsamic Braised Beef Short Rib. \n\nThe Pasta Pesto was amazing. Didn't want too hardy of a sauce and too much food so this dish was perfect. It had a light sauce (since usually pasta dishes have too much). The Pasta Brio...there is no wrong with this dish! Again, not an overwhelming sauce, portion is bigger than the Pasta Pesto, but perfect for eating it the next day. I can't vouch for the Short Rib and Ravioli, but I know our friends enjoyed it VERY much. \n\nOur waiter was great. He made the experience even better. Great recommendations, very personable, made us feel very welcomed. Also, it was my Aunt's birthday 2 days prior and we mentioned it casually and he ended up bringing a small dessert for her without us even asking. Haven't had service like this for a while."

Which amazed and thrilled me, he doesn't like Italian (because he never knows what to order and picks the wrong stuff) I love Italian especially because I get it so rarely! \n\nI got the caesar salad, yummy.  Perfect amount of dressing to food.  He got the Wedge Bistecca Insalata, he loves wedges so he was happy.  He finally followed my lead and got what I ordered, the Lobster & Shrimp Fettuccine.

We were immediately impressed with the set-up and interior of the restaurant. Compared to the Town Square (Las Vegas) location, it has an \"open\" feeling since the whole seating area of the restaurant is under one beautiful canopy of drapes. The outdoor seating has a beautiful view of the center of Tivoli Village.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy both Las Vegas locations and merely choose one based on where I am in the valley at the time!"

My guest and I were seated right after a supremely difficult woman, the type that just makes a fuss about everything. This made for some interesting dinner conversation, to say the least, and the staff seemed to handle her well. Certainly better than I could have! I came to the conclusion throughout dinner that our waiter was not supposed to be taking care of our section but was just picking up the slack for another waiter or trying to get some extra tables. Even despite this, I am certain I will be back.\n\nFirst off, the bread is sourdough! Any restaurant that has a default option of sourdough bread, sign me up. I had the lobster and shrimp fettucini and a chopped salad. Other Yelpers don't lie when they praise the chopped salad here! The shrimp and lobster pasta was as good as any I have ever head but still when I come back I think I will order a chopped salad. On the menu it is $5 and comes as a side, so maybe order two and ask them to combine it into a bowl. I am honestly surprised there is no entree option for this salad but I guess most people don't come to an Italian restaurant to have their cheapest salad option. It is that good though, so do yourself a favor and order it!"

I can't comment on the drink prices during happy hour because we were taking advantage of the free peach sangria and cucumber gin gimlets but the $2.95 tasting menu in the bar area is fabulous.  \nThe Ravioli Caprese arrived with 3 generously sized pieces of ravioli in marinara sauce. Not only was this dish tasty, but for $3 I was impressed by the portion size. The Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant was my favorite of the dishes we ordered. The portion is smaller than the ravioli but the flavor makes up for the size. So good, and only $3. We'll order two of those next time.

The accumulated experiences mandate that it's time for a review.\n\nFor a chain, I think it's one of the better ones.  Brio's food is consistently good and most of the time, above average for a chain restaurant.  We find ourselves going there with some frequency lately since this location is just a few miles from the house, in the nearby and still growing Tivoli Village.  Easy to get to, great underground parking (a huge plus in the summertime!), and a nice place to stroll after overeating.  (Yep, it's gonna happen.)\n\nThe food:  Two visits ago I had the Pasta Fra Diavalo.  Not my first pasta dish here because they do a great job with not overcooking the pasta.  The flavors were wonderful as alway and the dish was served at just the right temperature.  I don't know if they heat their dishes, but I noticed that the bowl didn't cause the pasta to cool rapidly--something that happens too often at many restaurants.  During my most recent visit I was able to sample a number of new tasty menu items:  a fresh Caprese Salad.  It was especially specially fresh and had just the right amount of dressing to allow the mild tomatoes and mozzarella to shine through.  Next the group of us shared a Sausage and Pepperoni Flatbread, cooked well so that the flatbread was at just the right place between soft and too crisp.  Next, Black Pepper Shrimp featuring middle-sized, peeled shrimp served on slices of eggplant and drizzled in a fantastic sauce.  Brio found a great way to combine shrimp and eggplant into what became an instant favorite.  I'll definitely order it again.  I sampled Brio's take on bread pudding for dessert and was pleasantly surprised.  I wouldn't normally order bread pudding, but I'm glad I had the chance to try this.  The portion was just right to follow a full meal and the pudding and sauce were delicious.  I'd definitely get it again.\n\nThe beverages:  If you're in the mood for a little wine with your dinner, I recommend the White Peach Sangria.  I'm not a fan of sweet wines or drinks, but this was nice and refreshing, and not too sweet to keep me from enjoying it.\n\nThe service:  Top notch for this kind of restaurant.  The staff is always there taking care of you, but they're not in the way or hovering.  I also love that they'll always tell you the specials, then make recommendations if you prefer.  I almost always ask and when recommendations come, they seem genuine rather than what might otherwise feel like they were told to push a particular dish that day.\n\nOverall, well done Brio!"

We sat RIGHT OUTSIDE and waited not long after were pleasantly surprised that another woman manager with a bun came up to us with a flatbread to take a piece while we waited. We were so grateful that she not only offered us a snack, but thanked us for waiting. Patronage is a huge thing in local restaurants and being thanked for waiting is a rare commodity.\n\nWell an hour passes and we finally get up And walk inside. We ask how much longer to be told they were paging us for 15 mins?? Apparently they gave us a broken pager that was fully lot and functional. Thanks to the First Lady manager. We're surprised at this considering there were 4 hostesses and 2 managers, not one of them would've walked outside to call our name? \n\nAt that point they handed my boyfriend a new charger and expected us to wait more.

            "review": "Let's get one thing straight - I love Brio at Town Square, so after going to the Kidville CYME today (8/22/11,) I headed over here at 11:30 AM. The place was pretty dead, save for a handful of tables. Literally, you could count the tables that were full on one hand. My three siblings and I were sat at a booth right next to the kitchen (annoying) and given menus. \n\nOur waiter would periodically pop in to say that he would be with us in a minute and after a little over 10 minutes, we finally got to order our waters. 5-7 minutes later, he ask if we still needed time with the menu or if we were ready to order. We were ready. After the wait, my sister and I were talking about just getting up and leaving - it's aggravating to be discriminated against because we're young. Don't put us in the back by the kitchen because we have two kids with us and don't ignore us because you think you won't get a good tip. Bad service, like what was exhibited, equals a bad tip.\n\nAnyway, I ordered the lunch portion of the sweet potato & chicken risotto with the bistecca salad ($12.95.) My sister got the fettuccine rustica ($9.95) and then our younger siblings got the kid's ravioli ($4.95) and the kid's fettuccine alfredo ($4.50.) \n\nMy food was okay but extremely salty/ msg-ish. It had that overwhelming umami flavor that comes with excessive msg so that made me leery. I actually got really full quite quickly and couldn't finish it all. Also, the risotto was kind of unappetizing with the cubes of not soft sweet potato and green beans. It was edible, but I wouldn't order it again. My sister complained that her pasta was also extra salty and she left most of the \"goodies\" in her bowl. The kids liked their pasta - it actually came in the same size bowls as our meals with the same sized portions. I was actually worried that the waiter didn't write that they were kids' meals.  \n\nWe got one water refill about 5 minutes before we got the check. We would have ordered dessert but my sister said she was really sick of constantly waiting for our waiter so I paid $40 and we bounced. Go to Brio at Town Square at Happy Hour if you want a great deal and great service. Come to Brio at Tivoli Village if you want to be ignored and leave unsatisfied with your meal."

The last time I went to a Brio was the Town Square location, with my wife, on our second date, four years ago. It hasn't improoved in that time. \n\nMy chopped dinner salad was a good portion, but very dry and tasteless.  My wife had the \"big\" pork chop. It was big and meaty, but very dry. My daughter in law had a chicken dish worthy of a cheap buffet. I forgot what my son ordered, but I tasted it, and it wasn't very good.\n\nThe service was very good. Our bread baket was constantly refilled, our drinks always full, and when my wife complained to the manager about her dry pork, the manager did offer a substitute, but we were already full (mostly of bread).  She did send a comp'd desert as a way of saying \"sorry\".\n\nEven though the service was very good, I would say it was a Rich Man's Bucca Di Peppo, with smaller portions, and an alternative for a High School Date to The Olive Garden."

We live in Los Angeles and were planning a wedding in Las Vegas, so I was very nervous about planning this via email and telephone, however the GM was extremely kind and helpful. First off, lets start with the fact that this location doesn't even have a \"wedding\"/or banquet room, the first time I called the manager informed me about their other location closer to the strip that had space to accommodate large parties and I explained to her that because our ceremony was in Summerlin, we wanted our reception to be there too so that guests wouldn't have to drive so far back and forth from the strip. She completely understood and welcomed our business. So, instead of taking up the majority of their restaurant on a Saturday night, they gave us the patio as well as a wrap around lounge area. Again, I was a little skeptical about the idea of my reception being on a patio, but we were running out of time and options within our budget and we booked Brio mostly because of their kind professionalism and because the food sounded delicious.\n\nSo, we began planning our menu, I emailed the GM probably around 20-30 times in the course of 3 months, and every time she responded within 24 hours and never seemed bothered or irritated. She allowed us to have table decorations and when I explained I was worried my family member would miss the ceremony due to setting up the tables, she offered to have some employees set up the dining area for us, and never even mentioned a service charge. Amazing. Also, she accommodated us with our menu choices completely and everyone in at our reception said the food was amazing and that they were going to look up the nearest Brio in their areas.\n\n I'll save you all the sob story, but basically we had some hiccups at our ceremony (insane photographer) and we were about ready to tell the limo driver to just keep driving and not even take us to our reception when we pulled up to this amazingly beautiful, twinkly lit patio that took both of our breath away. We ended up having the most amazing reception. We danced. We drank. We laughed. We cried. It was everything I wanted for my wedding and I have Brio to thank for it. Not only did our reception at Brio make up for a pretty lousy ceremony, they also told us \"not to rush\" and to \"stay as long as we're enjoying ourselves\". That is amazing. The servers not only went above and beyond all night long, they were attentive, personable, extremely quick and one of the girls even danced with my brother who has Down's Syndrome. She was such a sweetheart. I have never experienced such great service along with such amazing food in such a beautiful restaurant. Brio truly has it all. We are eternally grateful because you gave us the most beautiful wedding reception we could have asked for."

I would have liked to have told the server that everything was cold but, sadly, she didn't bother to check back to see how everything was.  I don't know when the potatoes or asparagus were prepared but I'm not even certain that they were made the same day.  Tasted like leftovers that I could pull out of my own refrigerator.

My only complaint is it def needed more balsamic. Their balsamic is a good one by the way.\nWe also had the lasagna bolognese. This item was really tastey. Nothing crazy extravagant and certainly nothing to complain about. It was just a great item \nThe prices were pretty good in my opinion. 10-20 a person without drinks.\nWhen we got there we were seated on the patio.

It was $2.99 for like 8 different dishes, but I recently went back and was disappointed to find that happy hour dishes are now $3.99.  The bartender told me they have some newer items, and the portions are bigger.  I wouldn't know as I went for the burger, which did not change in size.  They also told me they added $5 cocktails, which also didn't matter to me as I was drinking a regular priced Stella, if I remember correctly.\n\nI came back a few weeks later and had two apps, the beef carpaccio and the crispy shrimp.  I almost always get the carpaccio, so I was pretty excited when indeed a bigger plate arrived.  Except once I was digging in, I found that they had sliced the meat thinner than before, and so it seemed like the same amount... or LESS!  The meat kind of stuck to the plate, so it wasn't the same enjoyable appetizer that I was used to.\n\nThe crispy shrimp were a nice addition to the menu, though.  Tasty, plentiful, and not too much breading.  I definitely enjoyed that.  I also tried a $5 sangria rosa just so I could sample their drink menu, and it was good, but it didn't blow me away.\n\nThis is still one of the best happy hours on this side of town, but it's not the \"oh my god we have to go there\" deal that it once was."

For $5, a decent size list of specialty cocktails has something for most. \n\nThe two food items I ordered was enough to tide me over. The beef carpaccio with mixed greens is one of my regularly favorites. The shrimp with eggplant was a solid option as well. As an in between snack to banish hunger, a better deal is hard to come by. \n\nOne drink and two appetizers for $14. Check please."

When I explained what happened to him, he said nothing, but \"Would you like to order off the bar's happy hour menu in the main restaurant?\" While I appreciated that offer, an apology would have been the appropriate action, talking to the offended server would also have been an appropriate action (I doubt this happened).

The pleasant hostess took us to a nice and quiet corner table. The dining room was not crowded, yet, so was pretty quiet, although the bar area was hopping, as the patio was a bit too cold, even for the tough young crowd. Our server, Kim, was very friendly and helpful, and got our beer orders (Blue Moon, $5.25) started immediately. Good thing she did that for us, too, because the barkeeps were kept super busy by those happy yuppies, who \"never seem to have to work!\"  Boy do I envy them!  ;-)  \nThe wait staff quickly brought us our favorite bread basket with warm and delicious rolls, which we enjoyed over our beers. And I started feeling great!\n\nBTW: Brio's STILL  DON'T serve Blue Moon on DRAFT, yet, only in a bottle! SIGH! \n\nFor dinner, my wife ordered the \"Sliced steak salad\" (15.95), and I had the \"Mediteranian shrimps\" (15.95). Both were delicious! The steak was tender and juicy and in good quanty; shrimps were cruchy fresh and very tasty! Their presentations were quite appetizing - I totally forgot to take any pics of our dishes, being distracted by our hunger and discusions on our travel plans for 2014! Trust me, our dinners looked good! \n\nOur sweet server Kim (no, she is NOT Korean) was attentive and pleasant; her crew was efficient, keeping our water glasses full, and putting our finished dishes discreetly away. Kim also did us a great favor, taking the time to straighten out the mistakes with my Brio's reward account and honored my $15 reward credits - very nice of her!\n\nDuring our dinner, the hostess (perhaps also mgr) came by to say hello, and later helped the waitress out with our check. [i.e., taking it to/from the cashier, but NO, she did NOT really help out with the $Check, You Silly!]  ;-)   - A nice business practice! \n\nThe Brio brand is characterized by its reliable, good italian style cuisine of VALUE; spaciousness, comfy ambience; vibrant bar scene; excellent service. Hmm...table cloths also add a touch of elegance. Of course there are other comparable restaurants, but I think Brio stands out in ITS CLASS. \n- My friends say, it's like dining in a \"Mid-Upscale\" restaurant at Olive Garden prices. \n\nFor me, the Brio's in general and this locale in particular is one of the places I would go on a whim for happy hour (their $4 tasty small plates, Wed Martinis...are hard to resist at times) and/or for a tasty meal - NO SURPRISES!\n\nJan 2014"

There are certainly better options out there for both.  Their wine list has always been stale and conventional.\n\nThe most disappointing thing is their changing quality and quantity of HH items.  HH was the best thing they had going for them.  The first month that their Happy Hour was going the portions were much larger and it seemed as if more care was taken...when their burger was first added it was great for the price.  The patty has changed and it is now a crappy burger covered up in a good I-N-O style burger spread."

            "review": "Though we live pretty close to Tivoli, this was our first visit to Brio for dinner.  Our last attempt was for Happy Hour a year ago, but we bailed when we were directed to sit on the side of the patio in which every seat was in full sun -- and it was 112\u00b0 outside!  Happily, though the temp was five degrees hotter tonight, we ate in air-conditioned comfort.\n\nWe were with friends who are soon-to-be locals (if the husband ever gets his way), and our waitress, whose name I unfortunately don't remember, was extremely attentive and efficient throughout the meal.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the Bruschetta Sampler platter.  None of us realized until we were biting into different tastes that it was made up of all the different bruschettas they offered.  Some had prosciutto, some broiled tomato, and some were heavy on the balsamic (this is a good thing).  We enjoyed it a lot.  We also liked the Spinach and Artichoke dip, with the crunchy triangles of flatbread that accompanied it.  \n\nBrio tends to have a Mediterranean flair that tries to up it a notch from straight Italian, but for me this wasn't a plus.  I do love the food at Mediterranean restaurants, and am also a fan of Greek cuisine, but I'm not keen on feta cheese.  While trying to decide on an entree, almost everything I wanted to order had feta.  Happily, I was able to substitute gorgonzola in the Mediterranean Shrimp dish I settled on.  I could have also changed it to parmesan.  Four nicely-broiled shrimp sat atop a delicious melange of orzo, farro, broccoli, and artichokes.  I haven't had farro before (though I have a package of it in my pantry waiting for me to cook), and I liked the nuttiness that it added to the mixture.  If I hadn't already been full from the appetizers, I might have thought that there should have been one more shrimp on the plate.  Then again, it was 14.95, the shrimp were meaty, and I was stuffed before I started.\n\nTwo others ordered Chicken Milanese, and the third had Filet Mignon, which came with veggies and his choice of crisply roasted potatoes instead of the mashed it came with.  I didn't taste them, but they looked like a small version of potato skins without all the toppings, and he really liked them.  The Chicken Milanese was covered with mozzarella, which is unusual.  Add some red sauce and they would have had chicken parm.  That was served with a side of linguine in a plain tomato sauce.  The chicken was reported to be tender and perfectly cooked.\n\nWe shared a bottle of California Riesling; I think it was Wente, and wasn't overly sweet or dry, just right.  My only nit was the bread, because the dense bread with the hard crust that I love turned out to be sourdough.  I don't like sourdough, but others will disagree with me.  Other than that, it was a very enjoyable meal.  And we'll try Happy Hour again if the heat wave ever breaks.  Like in October  :)"

I'm in!\n\nI came here after working an event, just looking for a quick snack before hitting the long road back to Henderson. I bellied up to the bar and almost fell off my chair when I peeked at the menu saw the prices; the most expensive item was the Brio Burger for $6. I didn't order this, but instead went with Black Pepper Shrimp, Beef Carpaccio, Tuscan Tots and a Margherita Flatbread. \n\nEverything was very good, but the Black Pepper Shrimp was the winner of the meal. Seared Romano crusted eggplant with seared shrimp on top and some insane cream sauce, definitely not a low calorie option, but worth totally worth it. The beef Carpaccio is must order, it wasn't too fatty and cut paper thin it will literally melt in your mouth. \n\nThe Tuscan Tots were sneaky. I was thinking these would be your basic tater tots, but they are small mashed potato balls that are coated in breadcrumbs and filled with bacon, mozzarella cheese and fried, I'm done. The Flatbread pizza was great, covered in fresh veggies and flavorful basil, but compared to everything else it was probably least favorite out of the bunch, but still worth ordering.  \n\nThe price point was the best part of the whole meal, with two cocktails each and with all the food mentioned prior, our tab didn't break $40. \n\nHappy Hour goes from 3:30 - 6:30pm and then again from 8pm to close.

I don't know if the cost of rent in this place is so low it invites the kind of \"who cares if it fails\" culinary experimentation, or if it is so high restaurants are forced to try and sell you crap at a premium. \n\nAs an outside observer, it would seem as if Brio Tuscan Grille is the only restaurant that has managed to survive the Tivoli Village curse. Unfortunately, its mere survival does not preclude the fact that the restaurant as a whole is, well just blah. One look at the main photo on its Yelp page speaks volumes, the burger looks like something I would expect at my third cousin's \"backyard birthday bonanza\" for her 6 year old - they even cut it up in sections for the kiddies.\n\nThe food is not bad, and quite honestly I am impressed with the portion size of their appetizers, as they simply whet your appetite, not drown it. The unfortunate part is that the appetizers are only good if they are half off during happy-hour - I can't imagine paying full price for that. Which leads us to the rest of the menu, where the price points are where you would expect them to be if you were dining on the Strip. Not that I don't have great hope that Tivoli eventually becomes a great dining destination worthy of the high-dolar restaurants, but if it is Friday night and your place is half empty - well I'm just saying.\n\nThe service itself was okay, but one doesn't feel an abundance of warmth from the staff. Don't get me wrong, they did everything right and in a timely manner, it's just that there was no warmth there.\n\nI won't go as far as to say that Brio Tuscan Grille is a disappointment, I just can't imagine waiting in line for this place, which is probably why there isn't one."

I've never received such amazing genuine service from everyone that works at a restaurant. I sat at the bar this time and Terri was the bartender. If you ever have the chance to interact with her consider yourself lucky. She is so full of energy, fun, and attentive. She became very busy the day I was there but she always checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed or wanted. She's funny and all around a good genuine person. Every server that passed by me always asked how I was doing and how my food was. Jessie one of the managers is the cherry on top of amazing service. He is always cool calm and collected and I see him running around with the servers helping them out. He's a genuine guy who cares about the way his restaurant is ran. If you're looking for good food and GREAT service this is the place to be!!!"

It was setup very nicely, although I prefer the look and setup in Town Square (Thats just personal preference). The food was delicious as always and the staff was there to service, very friendly! \n\nThe staff did seem a little \"on edge\" and checking everything, but that is okay by me! I also think they were like that because it opened very recently, so they are still getting into the routine. Regardless, simply wonderful! I am sure with time this location will be just as popular as the Town Square location."

WIth this being the first day to really feel like summer (well, summer in Ohio, where I'm from) I really enjoyed sitting outside and enjoying the sunshine, the breeze and the passers by (including Carrot Top, who said hi as he ambled by). The atmosphere was fun and casual- I really liked the view of the outdoor section where diners sit separated from the sidewalks of Tivoli Village by an attractively scalloped, metal \"fence.\"  Aluminum-colored heating elements spaced throughout the outdoor area looked sculptural and artsy.  Large umbrellas protected patrons from the bright, hot sun.  Our waiter, Brian, had a great personality and made the experience even more enjoyable..\n\nI had the risotto with chicken and the tossed salad for about $14.00. It was tasty, but I liked my friend's shrimp version better.  The crusty bread served before the meal was quite enjoyable.  A couple of us had the wedge salad, which was accompanied by a gorgonzola and garlic dressing that, in my opinion, was light and not overpowering. My friends loved that it had bacon.\n\nI would definitely come here again and bring family or friends. Now I want to see what it looks like inside!"

I came here expecting Italian food (my usual is the lobster & shrimp ravioli) but went with the 5 oz. filet instead.  It was cooked perfectly - honestly one of the best steaks I've had!  It cut through like butter, the flavor was amazing, and I gobbled it down.  The portions are really small at Brio.  I was expecting my plate to be a bit more loaded for the price I pay compared to hole in the wall Italian restaurants found in Las Vegas.  I'm not talking about the filet, but the pasta dishes are rather small.  Otherwise my experience was positive from the food, the server, and the restaurant setting."

Town Square is much better, and nicer too! \n\nAmbiance: 3 - I mean, since you have the huge one at Town Square to compare it to, with TS's nice, high ceilings and romantic lighting..this location would be average. Tivoli seems like it caters more to families than the couples, adults, and tourists that crowd Town Square, sipping on wine and fancily buttering their bread. \n\nService: 4 - Our server was extremely funny and had a great personality. If there's one thing about Summerlin..they know customer service. \n\nFood: 3 - First thing that has to get out: Food is a bit too pricey for what it is. I mean $15 dollars for a steak salad?! Come on now haha! \n\nI do admit that I am really into salads lately, and Brio's sliced steak salad is one of my favorite combinations of meat and greens. But I do remember thinking that it was wayyy better at TS. \n\nIt was the meat that was -just slightly- better in quality at the other location. JUST slightly. It just tasted better at TS. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. It was average. Brio Tivoli is still a fair place to eat. But if there was a race... Brio Town Square would win."

There were only 2 servers.  One took the orders and the other delivered.  Unlike any other bar/restaurants we've gone to when it came time to get the bills we were told that we couldn't get individual bills.  We would get one bill for each table and it was up to us to figure out who owed what including each share of the tax.  After speaking to the manager, although she was very nice and smiley it still came down to; that's the way it is.  If you're a group of more than 4 don't go to Brio's happy hour."

My friend and I shared a pasta (I don't remember the name), and I thought it was alright, it wasn't appealing. For dessert, we had creme brulee and tiramisu. The creme brulee was good, unlike most people, I like the filling more than the caramel part, and their creme brulee has more filling than other places, so I was very pleased. On the other hand, the tiramisu wasn't that great, there was a strong rum taste in it. Maybe it's just me, I don't like that having too much rum in the tiramisu, so it was bad to me.\n\nOverall, this place is only a one time thing for me, I don't think I'll go back unless I want to give this place another try."

This mess tasted like it was pre made and sat in the walk-in for a few hours. Equally tasteless, the pasta. Here's a thought- garlic. It's Italian food for Christ's sake.\nAnd if your diner does not eat the salad, before removing it, ask if it was ok.

When I arrived (early)  I told the hostess that I was there and would let her know when my friend showed up. I told her it was my friend's birthday and asked it they did anything special. She said \"Oh yes!  She would post it on her reservation list.\"  \n\nWhen she seated us It was on time at 8:00PM on Wednesday night and the place was not the least bit crowded.  In fact it was very slow.  I asked her if I could see their brunch menu.  She said that it was just their regular menu. I have seen others post on here about their eggs benedict and other \"brunch\" items\".  hmmm. Maybe I just missed it on the regular menu. I wasn't planning on ordering anything from that menu, but wanted to consider it for a later occasion.\n\nWhen the waiter came, he was very gracious. He asked if we wanted any appetizers before dinner. I told him that I would like the bruschetta. NEVER GOT IT! I also ordered the lobster bisque and it was excellent. \n\nMy friend ordered the 7 ounce steak and said that it was very good.  I ordered the \"Pasta Brio\".  I have had better at Applebees. Seriously!  \n\nI had also seen on this site that some had raved about their bread basket and how wonderful their rolls were..  We didn't get a bread basket. I had to ask another waiter for it. It arrived with just little slices of some kind of toast - No rolls. \n\nMy wine was a 4 ounce glass of Cabernet. $13. THIRTEN Dollars!!! It was decent, but certainly not worth $13.  Hey this is not a Strip destination spot.  It's an upscale locals restaurant (At least I thought so.)\n\nI may come back for Happy Hour, but doubt if I eat dinner here again, Highly overpriced menu.  \n\nPS: Didn't have anything for a birthday - no dessert or anything. \nThis is the only review for a restaurant I have ever written."

Thank you also to Jesse, manager extraordinaire, for his most personable approach and care. Happy hour is very special!! Dinners are divine! Sunday Brunch is a must!! Experienced them al!! Enjoy Brio!!"

We sat on the patio which was filled with empty, dirty tables and remained that way throughout our lunch... Our server couldn't be bothered to open the door and actually come to the table but would just stick his head out, yelling... Didn't offer boxes, ask about the food or even return quickly after asking for the check... My son hated his food and we would have ordered something else had the waiter checked back before we'd finished eating...I could maybe understand it if he was super busy but it wasn't busy at all!! Upon returning after running my credit card he made a big show of shaking each of our hands which was weird because until then he couldn't have cared less about our service or food. Maybe he hoped the show would make us forget the terrible service... It didn't! Sadly I left a 15% tip, which I never do but I don't even think that was deserved. Won't be going back!"

It works out great because my coworkers can order one item each and we just share of each others plates. The Mojitos really hit the spot after a long day at work . They are nice and sweet! The patio area also has comfy couches you can sit on but I would suggest bringing sunglasses when dining in the patio area because the sun can be  quite strong. Brio has the cheapest Happy Hour I have experienced. You would think for the price they would skimp on the food but their portions are big enough to share!"

I came to enjoy their wonderful happy hour and great sangria and was heartbroken by the WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.\n\n1) it took the waitress 35 minutes to take our order. fine fine i'll let that slide..\n2) the waitress didn't bring us any bread. we thought it was because it was happy hour but all the surrounding tables had bread. \n3) we were sitting at a tiny cocktail table with 3 cups of water pitcher of sangria with 3 wine glass plus the salt/pepper sugar... summary. Not much room. when our food came he wouldn't take other dishes away. we asked him nicely to if he could take some dishes away and even passed it to him and he just walked away! HOW FREAKING RUDE. i thought he was going to put something down and come back because we CLEARLY had no room on our tiny little cocktail table to put 4 giant plates on the table and eat comfortably. but guess what. he left. like the jerk he is. \n4) when we needed the bill to get out of this place the waitress was no where to be found. this was suppose to be a quick drink eat and go that ended up taking over 2 hours because the waitress forgot we existed. \n\nthe food was still consistent and delicious as expected. but nothing ruins an eating experience worse than bad customer service.\n\nthe worst part of this visit was not only was the waitress terrible and inattentive. the food server guy was also terrible. it wasn't just one person that ruined my night. it was TWO. TWO TERRIBLE WORKERS. i couldn't believe the lack of customer service we received at this place.\n\nI'll never come back to this Brio again."

One of the best HH I've had. \n\nHH specials are for food & drinks and it's from $4-$6 which is a pretty good deal with the amount of food they give you! For foods we got Beef Cappaccio, Crispy Eggplant fries, black pepper shrimp, Crispy cheese ravioli, and Roasted garlic spinach artichoke dip. All oh so delicous! My favorite would have to be the Crispy eggplant fries which is pretty crazy because I do NOT like eggplant at all. Also I think the Crispy Cheese Ravioli was to die for. It wasn't too cheesy, it was the perfect amount of cheesiness! \n\nFor drinks we got White Peach Sangria, Sangria Rosa, & Mango Mojito. I really liked the Sangria Rosa. Now it's really not real sangria because real sangria is fruits marinated in wine but they just put some fruit in a cup & add wine with vodka. Still good tho.\n\nBest bartender there, hands down is Geoffrey. He accomodated each of our needs. When the door was open and the wind was blowing our hair all over our faces, he shut the doors. We were right under the AC vents which was blowing cold a** air right on top of us making us shiver uncontrollably, he made the waiters turn the vents off. He also made us his speciality shots, on the house! \n\n2nd time I went was the next day for brunch. Not as good as Happy Hour. I got the Salmon with Angel Hair with Lobster Bisque. Was not that good. It had a sauce that was kind of on the sour side.  & the lobster bisque was on the salty side. There was a fly buzzing around our table that was annoying me! \n\nThis place would be a solid 5 star rating for me if I did not come back for brunch the next day. None the less, I would probably return for HH again!"

Our server, Tom, was on his A game. He greeted us and immediately got the drink order. What I appreciate is communication, and he let us know that he'd be right back. While taking our order, I let him know that I had a birthday voucher for Shrimp Scampi and beef medallions and my friend got the Chipotle Chicken & Bacon Panini with to Ceasar salads, in addition. The best was when Tom asked me how I wanted the medallions cooked. I asked Tom what the meat was and he said 'cow'. AWSOME! I laughed. The salads came right away and were delicious. Plenty of dressing and parm (the way I like it), with sweet Romain lettuce. Shortly after, came the fresh flat bread and bread basket with butter that tasted like it was homemade. This Brio seems more open and brighter than it's big sister. The food came the second my salad dish was removed and it looked beautiful. It tasted even better. It was an amazing birthday lunch and I am happy with our service from Tom. Thank you, Brio Tivoli!"

The eggplant pomodoro was ok...could hardly tell the cooked-to-death mush inside was once eggplant, but it was edible. The pasta it came with was very good, perfectly cooked with a very nice balance of garlic, seasoning, and oil. Next time, I'll have a simple pasta dish; they seem to know their pasta. The desserts were very good. I had the mocha pannacotta, and my friends had tiramisu and choc lava cake...all very, very good. \n\nI can't give it more than a solid 3-star rating (this review ain't bad overall...it's just that mushy low-flavor eggplant that's sticking in my craw...maybe when I go back I'll be able to push it to 4 stars if I'm a big fan of whatever I order then).

Had the shrimp and crab crepes for brunch.  Scrambled eggs, shrimp, crab, and asparagus rolled up in crepe served with fresh fruit and fried red potatoes.  Sounds awesome.  It was far from it,  To start off the smell of the over ripe melon in the fresh fruit overwhelmed my plate with a horrible smell.  Strike one.  Next I moved to the potatoes, over cooked to the point that  they were black and burnt to a crisp.  Strike two.  Next the crepes, the eggs were over cooked and dry, there was not crab or shrimp in them, the asparagus was flavorless and overcooked, and the hollandaise sauce taste like something out of a box or package.  Strike three.  Sadly they had a fourth strike as well.  Everything on my plate was the same temperature, the crepes and the potatoes were cold, and the fruit was warm.  I try to give everyplace a second chance, but I am not sure this place is worthy of that."

We requested the burger to not be over cooked and it was good like we asked, however our server seemed annoyed when we asked him to let kitchen know not to over cook it.

The lunch menu has a lot of variety and I probably would have been happy ordering one of 4 or 5 different things, but lasagna wins almost every time, and Brio's version is quite nice.  It comes with your choice of 3 different salads (chopped, Caesar, or house) and I was very happy with the chopped.  Far more than a boring plate of greens, and it isn't drowning in dressing.   The lasagna arrived not long after, and it's made with white sauce, meat, and the usual noodles/cheese/sauce.  I dove in and was a little sad when I took the last bite because for a second, I contemplated ordering another.  It's nicely balanced, has just a teeny tiny amount of burned edges of cheese/noodle.and the meat is moist, like a meatloaf.\n\nMimosa wasn't anything to get too excited about, but the raspberry gelato (not on the dessert tray) was the perfect amount of dessert.  Allegedly Brio may make its way to California, and I can't wait!  So much better than Olive Garden!"

Along with crayons and the kids menu to color, they also brought Pizza dough for my daughter to play with. They even offered to cook it for her when she was done- but she was having too much fun just playing with it. \n\nI have never been to a Brio Tuscan Grille before so I had no expectations.  In fact, I didn't even know it was a chain restaurant at the time. Nonetheless, I am a fan of the food.  I ordered the Fettuccine Rustica and I highly recommend this dish if you like sun dried tomatoes.  I added the Bistecca Ensalata for an additional $3.95 and this salad was a meal in itself.  It was so delicious and so filling- I may just get a whole order of that next time since I am a sucker for gorgonzola cheese and bacon!  My husband ordered the chopped salad to start with and the Shrimp and Crab cakes.  It had only come with 2 average sized cakes, but they were so flavorful and surprisingly quite filling.  We ordered the kids lasagna for my daughter, and for $4.95- this was practically an adult serving.  In fact, the three of us shared it because it was that big, and that delicious! \n\nThe dessert display looked too fabulous to pass us, so I ate about 1/4th of my delicious pasta and had the rest packed up to take home.  We ordered the creme brulee and the raspberry cheesecake and both were the perfect way to end such a satisfying lunch.  The total bill for the 3 of us was less than $50. And it was well worth it- the ambiance, the service, the food were all great."

For this specific location, I've only been for happy hour, but I don't see how their regular menu would differ from their location at Town Square.  \n\nTheir happy hour must be one of the best!  They have a list of items for $2.95.  Don't let the price fool you though.  Their portions are decent sized.  We always order one of everything, and maybe even two of some other things.  (Don't judge us!!)  How could you not though?  Cheap, good food is so hard to pass up!\n\nTheir service is always amazing.  They check several times to make sure everything is okay and refill drinks before it is necessary."

Ordered the burger, artichoke dip and the ravioli. Bartender was friendly enough to tell me the eggplant shrimp is the best thing they've got, so I take him up on it.\n\nHe was right, the eggplant shrimp was very, very good, and I don't even like shrimp that much. Ravioli was good too, I'd probably get it again. Burger had a charred taste to it I liked. The burger was pretty simple, but hey, it's $3.95.\n\nFor the drinks I believe they only have Sangrias, Martinis, wine, and Mojitos for $5. No beer as far as I could tell.\n\nThe bartenders seemed nice and knew the regulars by name, the ambiance is good, parking is easy in Tivoli Village, and the prices for happy hour are worth it. Nice spot for a slightly more \"upscale\" happy hour at cheap prices."

Then when we finally got seated and it took another 10 minutes just to be greeted by a waitress.  From there we get our menus and complimentary bread and wait another 15 minutes for our waitress to deliver our drinks and take our orders.  \n\nNext, we were not given silverware or plates for our bread.  And unbelievably our waitress could not be found and was not even in eyesight until 15 minutes later.  So we ended up eating bread off of our menus (which she for some reason didn't even take away once we ordered) with no napkin or anything.  \n\nThe utensils finally came along with our meals.  The food itself, an omelette and brunch quinoa salad, was just alright.  The portion size was good but the eggs themselves didn't seem anything too great and probably not worth $11 each.  I guess you're paying for the ambiance of Tivoli in that case.  Buta gain the waitress struggled when we asked for some extra condiments and it took her so long to track some down that we were halfway done with our meals by then.\n\nWe overheard the waitress talking to another party about getting some food comped since her service was so bad for them, so I'm guessing we just got stuck with a new waitress who was having a bad day or something; but still, it gave the restaurant a very poor first impression from my point of view from her service.  \n\nI hear the Happy Hour is worthwhile so I could be back for a drink or two in the future, but it's not likely I'll ever come back for a full meal, especially at the Tivoli location."

I dined at a Brio at a different location, but it had been a few years. We had to wait for a few minutes, but that's expected on a Saturday night. Once we were seated, our server took our drink order and then our food order. The wait wasn't very long and the food was delicious. I had the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. My partner had the lasagne. My meal was absolutely scrumptious. I was hesitant about ordering it, but my server guaranteed me that I would enjoy it. He was right. I tasted the lasagna and it was cheesy and tasty. There was nothing special about the service. It was average. The restaurant was a little louder than I. Ike, but once my meal arrived, I easily forgot about that. I'll definitely go back more often."

Most of the servers I've had there have been very friendly, got the time to know us and chat it up a bit.  Sometimes we come when it's busy and we don't see our server much; which is fine, I don't like when people hover anyway, but it would help if we didn't have to wait for them to walk by so we could ask for something.\n\nThe goods: Incredible happy hour.  The Brio Burger is probably my favorite thing to get but I've tried just about everything on the HH menu and I can't remember disliking anything.  The basic menu can get a little pricy.  I ordered a salmon salad something or other once, $14.95.  I won't say it wasn't worth the money because, oh my God it WAS.  But, I'm just saying, pricy (at least for me).  I love their dessert display.  We do something similar at the fine dining restaurant I used to work at.  They bring the plate over so you can look at your desserts.  Very good eye-catcher.  I always order the chocolate cake thingy (I should really learn the names...but whenever I order I sort of just point and say, \"I want THAT.  Please and thank you.\")  Their raspberry mascarpone cheesecake is heaven.  It melts in your mouth and the crust is the only thing left to chew.\n\nThe atmosphere: I think in all the times I've come here I've only sat inside once.  I love sitting outside watching the shoppers of Tivoli Village.  It always kind of freaks me out though when one of the valet boys starts running for a car.  I have to turn around and see the red uniform before I realize it's not some guy stealing a lady's purse.  Other than that, everything else is great.  The lighting adds a lot to the ambiance, from the restaurant, and other shops alike.  And my friends and I are always listening intently to the music, trying to guess the language and what they're saying.  I think coming to Brio is going to end up being a weekly thing for us.  We're all kind of night owls these days and we've got to start somewhere, best to do it where we can fill our stomachs and prep for the night ahead."

Our guests were raving about the service we received and the beautiful atmosphere . Having spent several years in Italy during my military career, I know excellent Italian food when I taste it and Brio has it all together. A nice  touch was added by Brio Manager Prado who stopped by to ask if we were satisfied with our service and food. With so many restaurants in the surrounding area to choose from, there is little wonder why we choose Brio when we are looking for an exceptional night out"

After we were done we waited even more. About 20 min or so till we got some service and that's because I had to go up to a manager to ask. And all this waiting we were watching our server walk past us many times without any acknowledgment that we were in his section. Never would I have thought I would have a horrible experience here.

Also, their entr\u00e9es are a cut above for an upscale fast casual restaurant, and their prices are reasonable.  The entr\u00e9es on my previous visits have been consistently good.  Not so much on my latest visit.  I ordered the Ham & Biscuit Benedict, $10.50 off the Brunch Menu.  It consists of two poached cage free eggs, Cherrywood smoked ham, housemade biscuit, hollandaise. Served with brunch potatoes.  First, I was disappointed in the fact that my breakfast was not hot and was served cold.  Bottom line, hot food should be served hot.  The Cherrywood smoked ham had no flavor due to it being over cooked, as a result it was tough and chewy.  Likewise, the house made biscuit was hard as a rock.  On my previous visit their brunch potatoes were a big hit with everyone.  This time they were over seasoned and very salty.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise was good.  Two other people in our party had the same entr\u00e9e and made same or similar comments.  Service was great.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  In closing, I recommend the Brio.

We found a nice Ruffino that we liked so much, we had a couple bottles. Small groups do great here -- especially in the sharing department. (The bread/cracker basket is dangerous, be forewarned). \n\nNow, should you order the carpaccio appetizer (which I recommend you do), be prepared for a large portion that you'll either share, or have no need for an entree.  Good meat, tangy argula and shaved parm: all good.   This second time, I was set to have a salad but randomly queried if there was anything not on the menu. Gazpacho I was told, and yay to that!  It had excellent flavors, and a pleasant texture, complemented with just enough kick. Mmm. And it was cold, of course. Truly an excellent way to start a meal -- especially since it was, um, 110 degrees outside -- at least!\n\nDespite the weather, we were very comfortable inside. Service flowed effortlessly -- or maybe that was the wine. Still, I enjoyed a very good Filet, cooked to order. This is not a steakhouse, of course. Rather Brio has many things they offer - with a Mediterranean way about them. Entrees are typically served with their mashed potatoes (which I couldn't imagine), but our Server was flexible: she easily swapped the spuds for spinach. \n\nThe pastas looked, and I'm told, are good. There was a nice salmon a few folks ordered. Tasted it myself, and it was perfectly fine -- with some memorable flavors that right now I forget. Really, there were no sour notes here. Which leads me to dessert --- always fun with a group. We tried several, and they were all outstanding. Seriously, we must have had three or four we worked on. Top things off with good coffee, or espresso, and you're good."

We waited 10 minutes too long before our waitress Hollie came to serve us.  She never introduced herself and the only reason I know her name it is because it is stated on the ticket.  I asked her specifically if the spaghetti bolognese was an entree that we could order and if it was made the same as before she said yes it is.  We had put in 2 orders and it came out with a different kind of pasta.  The gentleman that brought it out to us explained to us that it is made differently now which Hollie never told us after I had asked her specifically if it was.  The waiter was kind enough to change the order for us and we got what we originally wanted.  Hollie never stopped by the table to apologize for the mistake, as a matter of fact she completely disappeared for the entire dinner until we were finished.  Only then she asked if our meal was ok.  She never checked on us and didn't offer any bread, which we had to ask for, or was around for us to get more water or drinks.  The worse part is that she wasn't friendly at all and if anything made it very unpleasant for us dine there and made us feel discriminated.  Employees like her shouldn't be in the hospitality industry and she is costing you money by not providing a great experience for your customers.  If we had a better service we would have gotten more drinks and stayed for dessert.  It is very unfortunate that she represents your company and that we could have gotten better service somewhere else.

Also a good variety of happy hour appetizers to choose from. I wish they could incorporate more items that aren't fried. Very spacious and clean. They also have the best lobster bisque! I can never remember which pasta dishes I get when I go for lunch/dinner but I have never been disappointed. They also have an outdoor seating area. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have a favorite dish there which is the seared steak salad or sometimes for a healthier version we substitute it the steak for salmon. great mixture of greens and the dressing they use is so delicious. A good amount of food for the price you pay. \n\nComparing it to the TS location I believe this is a little smaller but I like both. No complaints!"

The servers are professional without being stuffy - -always pleasant and helpful, and you never feel they are pressuring you to run up the bill.  The food is divine.  The portions are large, so I often just get two appetizers.  They have both indoor and sheltered outdoor seating, and can accommodate large groups.  If you get a loyalty card (no cost), you can receive email offers for discounts and special meals.  Both the Las Vegas and Miami locations are equally good, and both are located near excellent shopping, making them excellent choices for lunch with I am running errands on a weekend.  Both locations also have valet parking."

Happy Hour  lounge indoor and outdoor seating  is a great deal with food and drinks.\nOn this visit we had dinner in the dining room. The room was conversation friendly. For a starter we chose the Bruschetta Quattro which was wonderful. Our entrees were the Chicken Limone and Cioppino. The Chicken was a large portion, very moist\nand perfectly cooked. The Cioppino arrived with 2 clams and 1 mussel that were not open. Our waitress apologized and reported the problem to the chef. She returned with a large plate of clams and mussels and again apologized. The Cioppino had a good variety of seafood and I would order it again. Overall Brio has a large menu with something for everyones taste. The service is professional and timely."

It's true folks, Tivoli- Brio blew me away with their attentiveness and spectacular customer service during my dinner last night.\n\nGreeted by two perky hostesses the (I assume) Manager escorted my date and I to our table.  Before we could even place the cloth napkins on our laps our server was at our table kindly taking our drink orders.  \n\nSifting through the menus placed on the table, wine list, dinner menu, I stumbled upon the GLUTEN FREE menu! Yes, a special menu just for me.. My excitement continued when I browsed the decent list of gluten free options, including pasta.  Fellow allergy sufferers would agree that most restaurants name their basic protein dishes their \"gluten free option's\"..pause while I yawn.. But I digress.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my Cesar salad with CRISP, fresh Romain lettuce, dressed to perfection. My taste buds were then taken on a gluten free amazing pasta trip that was out of this world..\n\nTwo glasses of wine and a full belly later, this girl was a happy diner.  The manager checked on our table while we dined, bussers were exceptionally attentive clearing plates promptly, and our server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive as well.\n\nAll in all I give this Brio (2) very solid thumbs up.  I sincerely hope they keep up the above average customer service and delicious gluten free menu options.\n\nWest Side, should we meet again and I am in the mood for Italian food, Brio you're at the top of my list!"

I came for happy hour, and I tell you their happy hour really makes you happy! they have a $2.95 happy hour menu for your basic appetizers, finger foods, and a regular sized burger. Although they don't have a happy hour menu for drinks. I think the over all quality of the food makes up for it all. The BRIO burger is awesome, and definitely a steal for the price! The buns are toasted, and the meat is so tender and juicy. Full of flavor! We also ordered a bunch of chorizo fonduta. I would highly reccomend that along with their margherita flatbread. You will definitely get full fast, and still have some left over!"

The management at Brio was more than helpful and made me feel comfortable and at ease at hosting the dinner.  We had never eaten at a Brio restaurant. Picking a place to eat from out of town is a little scary.  We were more than pleased.   They did an amazing job at securing our group in the back with a semi private area yet still part of the restaurant.  50 people sat comfortable.  We had our own table for two in the middle of our  group.  The tables were beautiful.  Everyone raved about the food and choices offered on our preset menus.  We had our own 3 servers and they did a spectacular job.  Thank you for completing our wedding day."

It was terrible. I've noticed the portion size of the steaks shrinking over the last few months but this was nearly half the size it used to be! And the perfect medium rare at which it's typically served was more like well well. Dry, hard, completely void of flavor. I honestly don't think I'll ever order it again. And that's sad.

            "review": "The wifey wanted to come back to Brio after her and her girlfriend came the week before for Happy Hour.  Honestly, it was just OK.\n\nI agreed to go because since its opening I still hadn't been to Tivoli Village.  I'm for 'yuppie-ism' in many cases, and seeing how rich people sometimes like to spend their money just amazes me (and somewhat annoys me at the same time).  But to each their own.  Who am I to tell the local Summerlin millionaire that the restaurant chains they visit are often vastly inferior to the local Mom & Pop Italian deli down the way?  They'll probably just scoff then go back to their yuppie gym (I'm looking at you David Barton) where apparently only people with 8+ abs, and Armani workout clothes can sweat it out.  Yes, I am in fact wearing last, last, last season Adidas sneakers (but in my defense they are a rare blue pair) and a pleather jacket.  \n\nTivoli Village was nice, but I was right in that it caters to specific clientele.  I like window shopping (unlike my homeboy 50 Cent) and wow, 'what-I-cannot-afford-even-if-I-tried' syndrome took over.  But I digress on back to eating (and fantasizing I was P-Diddy's hidden 16 year old bastard son).\n\nSeems like Brio is one of the only restaurants that has survived the turmoil of Tivoli Village.  A number of eateries here have come and gone over the year.\n\nNow I can only comment on their late night Happy Hour after 9 PM in the bar area.  I will have to try the regular restaurant some other time if we ever go back.  The hostesses were nice, showed us exactly where the bar area was in no time.  Seats were open, and we were told to sit anywhere in the bar for Happy Hour.  We chose a nice little table towards the wall section.  Our waitress was quick, and asked if we were interested in some drinks or if we were going to stick around for Happy Hour.  We told her we indeed there for Happy Hour and were immediately offered one of their bar plate menus.  \n\nThere are a decent number of dishes available during Happy Hour, around 10 or so.  The pricing is good, between $4 - $6 each.  There are a number of drink specials as well.\n\nI stuck with a Peroni beer for $4, not exactly a value, but apparently it's cheaper than normal.  Really?  Damn markup must be massive!  The wifey and I wanted to share the Black Pepper Shrimp plate, but according to our waitress they were out of the cream sauce for it.  Huh?  How hard is it for a kitchen to whip up a cream sauce exactly?  I certainly hope you have an ITALIAN kitchen that can make cream sauces all day long!  Alfredo, anyone?  Was just beyond me but OK.  We opted for the Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip instead.  We also got an order of Beef Carpaccio, and two BRIO burgers.\n\nPlates took around 20 minutes to arrive, average for most restaurants.  But it wasn't exactly busy when we were there so I don't know what the holdup was.  I gotta say though that our plates weren't exactly news to write home about.  Yes, I know it's Happy Hour, and yes I know the pricing is considered 'cheap', but come on now.  These were some ugly looking plates!  Poorly executed for the most part.  The Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip with flatbread triangles was alright.  It seemed to be sitting under the heat lamp for a bit on the long side, top layer of it was hard.  It tasted ok, but should I be ashamed to say it tastes like something I can pick up at Costco?  Let me get on with the BRIO burger.  Wow.  $5 for this?  A thin burger patty with Provolone and roasted tomato mayo on what looks like a Costco hamburger bun?  And a side of housemade 'chips', once again, that could be from Costco?  Now before you get your panties in a twist, I adore Costco and shop there weekly (and drink a kale shake almost daily).  I'm just saying, if I can make the same stuff from ingredients at Costco, why go to Brio?  Why?  And this BRIO burger was plated funny too.  A 5-year old can make a plate better than this.  The burger, no lettuce, no tomato?  Cut into four pieces, and chips stuffed in the middle of the plate?  Rookies!  It didn't taste the greatest either.  Burger was overcooked and dry, the cheese was near non-existent, the roasted tomato mayo was barely there, and there was too much bun!  For the price I could have gone to Wendy's right nearby and gotten a bigger burger.  Just so-so for me.  The best item of the night was the Beef Carpaccio.  Ultra thin slices of raw beef, topped with dressed field greens, capers, a mustard aioli, and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano.  This plate was DELICIOUS.  Beef was nice and cold, greens had great crunch, capers and the mustard aioli added a nice bite, and the cheese gave it an extra layer of flavor.  We heartily ate this up.  All for $4!  Next time I won't waste any effort and just get two orders of carpaccio.  And maybe a Peroni.\n\nRant done Brio."

My pasta had way too much sauce and the fish was almost invisible. One of the meals came out with the wrong noodles but they apologised immediately and made a new one quickly without fuss which was great.

Finally ordered (we couldn't make up\nOur minds) and I opted to start with a salad and artichoke dip. Dip was okay. Nothing special. I'd love to mention the salad but it never came. Got the spicy chicken bacon sandwich. BEWARE it tastes like chipotle sauce and mayonnaise only! It was the most awkward tasting item is ever had before! French toast was underwhelming as well. Very tart with some gross lemon filling. But the fruit and syrup were delicious. Which we had to ask for syrup from three different people. Bc we were still hungry we ordered a side of scrambled eggs... Which took twenty minutes to arrive. Then I had to go to the bar for ketchup. It was just an overall poor experience. We wanted to love this place. The patio is very nice to enjoy! We had a great time people watching!"

The salad had tender slices of steak with a chopped salad that had a delicious balsamic dressing along with tomatoes, gargonzola, mushrooms, spicy pecans and I think there was a bit of creamy horseradish that gave it that perfect BITE with the steak!! Wish they had this dish at home! \n\nWe also had the special which was the Seared Scallops with Risotto - I think my hubby pretty much inhaled this dish and the plate licked clean!  Other family members had the Lobster and Risotto!  The TAIL was HUGE - they LOVED it and each of the risottos were paired with wine which went perfectly with each of the dishes!\n\nWe were so stuffed we couldn't eat dessert but i have to tell you - the food, service, atmosphere was PERFECT! We sat around and enjoyed our meal and company with water glasses getting filled and just great service all around.\n\nI actually wish we had a Brio Tuscan Grille in the bay area but at least now we know a go to place when in Vegas!!"

It did it twice; the first time we thought someone had flipped sauce on her, and three of us helped her get it out of her hair.  The second time, we looked around and noticed the bird above her head.  The staff was disgustingly unprofessional, insulted us with a 20 dollar gift card after we spent 500 dollars on food (that's not even enough to go back and have the meal paid for!!), the waiters and waitresses laughed, told other guests, swore, and mocked our family.  Your staff implying that a filthy disease ridden animal defecating on guests near the kitchen of your restaurant is out of the company's policy to make things right makes me shudder to think what else you would not help on.  I've had better customer service in every single other restaurant I've ever attended.  To make matters worse, when posting complaints on your Facebook wall, after talking to my sister in law who ever manages that account LIED and said she was fine with how things were handled!  Your customer service is disgusting and as we now see on more than just your one restaurants standard.  We are a family of 20 adults with in laws, 30 grandchildren and have been established in Las Vegas.  Your lack of class and neglegance has lost all of our business and all of extended family and friends business."

One got tortellini and one got the gargonzola crusted lamb chops. We also had calamari and caesar salads for appetizers. All food was great. We had cocktails and then got a bottle of wine. The wine selection never disappoints. Toward the end of dinner, they brought out creme brulee with a candle for the bday boy which was nice. The table ordered dessert drinks (I had an amazing port wine!). \n\nSo why only 3 stars? We loved the service and the food. The problem was the fire alarm. It went off not once but twice during dinner. So loud thay everyone was plugging their ears. Strobe lights flashing. It took a very long time for it to stop each time. I understand that this might be out of the restaurants control, but they could have done something to appease the few tables of people in the restaurant. After the first alarm, a manager walked around apologizing. After the second, nothing. There weren't many people in the restaurant at 9:30 so it would have been a nice gesture to at least offer a drink on the house or something. No more apologies or compensation. It just seems a little unprofessional when we're spending $300 and had to sit through alarms twice. \n\nIf you can go and avoid the alarm (or don't mind them not caring if it ruins your dinner), everything else is great!"

Unfortunately after she took the order, she returned much later to ask if we would like dessert. I guess what happens between the initial order and the time they are ready to clear the table for the next party does not matter much. The guy who actually delivers the lunch was ill-prepared to serve us because the table was covered with dirty dishes from the appetizer round. Hello? Clear the table and then bring the meal. Got busboys? Use them. It also never pays to respond to the typical question, \"Is there anything else you need?\" because you never get what you need. A simple request for red pepper flakes, which should be within reach of every table in an Italian restaurant, was completely ignored. I guess he had other things to do such as deliver water to each new customer regardless whether the water is requested or not. (I thought there was a water shortage in this town. Never mind....) Considering the location (Tivoli Village, the \"Rodeo Drive\" of Summerlin) the service was at best cordial, but hectic. Maybe adding more staff during the Christmas season, as many offices are having their office parties these days, would be helpful. I am sure we will be back, as I say for the great food, but dear friends, bring your own red pepper flakes if you like your food spicy."

Having dined at the Brio in Town Square, and enjoyed it several times, we decided to give this location a go.\n\nThe patio was lovely at 11am on a Saturday. We managed to get there before the rush, so we had our pick of seats and it was quiet and very relaxing. \n\nOur server wasn't the best in the world. He was a tall slim guy (though all the servers seemed to be super tall and slim) with a huge band-aid on the side of his neck. I assume this was to cover some kind of tattoo, but it wasn't that appetizing, i'll be honest.\n\nHowever, because he was so soft spoken and meek, I thought maybe he had some kind of life-saving throat or neck surgery and cut him some slack.  His service was super slow and he forgot about us a few times, but I refused to let it ruin the brunch and let Mr. Potential Cancerous Goiter and/or Criss Angel Tattoo off without griping.\n\nThe peach bellini is TO DIE for. So good and comes in a giant pint glass. I thought it was going to be a simple bellini in a champagne flute, but no, this was like a booze slurpee. For $7. I'll have two next time.\n\nI had the eggs benedict, which was absolutely delicious. The grilled asparagus that came with it was gone in 30 seconds. I like my poached eggs on the medium-well side and mine came so runny they were almost cold inside (which I realize is how some folks like them). But the manager, who happened to be walking by, had them remake them, despite my protests. She was really attentive and personable. I should've gotten her name -- she's got long dark hair and blue eyes, kinda on the wee side.\n\nI'd definitely go back to this location, especially  for brunch.

Because as my husband said, \"There's nothing but martinis and mojitos on this damn drink list!\"  It's true, 95% of the menu is sugary and girly concoctions, but sometimes I like me a good lemon drop!\n\nOpinions on the drinks:\nThe drinks are nicely made and tasty and they're all only $5.  My favorite is one of the special ones they have on Wednesdays that is like a lemon drop with basil.  The sangria rosa is better than the white peach sangria.  The strawberry mojito tastes like fresh strawberries.  The red wine is a good, dry one.\n\nOpinions on the food:\nThis is the money maker right here.  During HH, they have a special food list where everything is $3.95.  My husband and I ordered a hamburger to share.  Wowza, when it came out, it was like the size of a Carl's Jr. burger and it came with homemade potato chips.  What, what, what?  This whole thing is only $4?  And it was a delicious hamburger with melted provolone cheese and a zingy little secret sauce.  The gentleman next to us ordered the spicy crispy shrimp and a sausage flatbread, both of which were also generously sized for the $4 pricetag.  When I went with my friend, we ordered the ravioli caprese.  Very tasty, but it only comes with 3 ravioli.  Come on...you give out a huge burger and chips, but only 3 ravioli?  I was a little disappointed in that.  We also ordered the shrimp and eggplant which has a really nice smoky sauce to it.\n\nIt does get crowded during the HH, and sometimes you have to wait a while to get the bartender's attention, but that is what you have to expect when it's a great HH.  My advice: get there around 3:30 so you can find a seat and put an order in before the rush!"

They take both reservations and walk-ins so lucky for us since we didn't make a reservation. The estimated wait time was 80 minutes? But we actually got in earlier, probably 30 to 40 minutes?\n\nAnyways... We ate outside near a heat lamp which wasn't too bad in today's weather. We ordered calamari as our appetizer which was fine. I mean, it's calamari... Not much else to it. For our entrees, I got the pasta brio which is grilled chicken with rigatoni. My boyfriend got campenelle carbonara which kind of resembled chicken Alfredo. I also got a flirtini - probably won't get that again. It resembled cough syrup to me, but that could just be my taste buds.\n\nAll in all, for $67 this was definitely not a bad place for a date. We will probably check out the one in Town Square once the weather gets warmer since they have a fire pit outside.\n\nHappy eatings!"

There was a live band playing in one one coutyards with people mingling and dancing.  Very cool.  If and when additional phases of this complex are completed, it will be a wonderful destination.\n\nThe restaurant carried the theme of the complex, with beautiful flooring, stonework and large spaces.  The vibe, ambience, seating and service were all excellent.  We had a 6:30 p.m. reservation and had to wait 15 minutes for our table, the only drawback to an otherwise perfect evening.\n\nThe wine was priced reasonably asnd the beer was ice cold.  We ordered the quartet of brushetta.  It was beautifully plated, visually appealing and delicious.  My wife had the penne alla vodka, which she really enjoyed.  I had the veal Marsala, with a very dark, rich sauce that was a bit too thick for my taste but otherwise excellent.\n\nWe look forward to going again."

If you are lucky enough to grab a table inside or outside before 630 pm you are definitely set to enjoy a budget friendly happy hour.  It was a Wednesday night about 6pm I was lucky enough to grab a table in the bar area.  It was very busy.  There was some weird guy playing a guitar and singing to keep me and my friend entertained while we waited for the table to be cleared and cleaned.  Not sure if this is a regular thing for brio now providing live entertainment but it was the first I have seen. In any case he was ok, not terrible.  Lol. Our waitress I believe it was Monica K. ( at least that's the name on our receipt) was great!  She ended every sentence with...\"it's my pleasure\".  Even though it was obvious she was slammed, she never lost her cool and never lost her smile.  She came around to let us know last call for happy hour, which was greatly appreciated.  We ended up with three martinis, one spinach and artichoke dip, two brio burgers and one chocolate cake all for $40.87.  What a steal! Especially since the food is great too!  Burgers are juicy. They have a great variety of items on their happy hour food menu.  In addition to a happy hour drink menu, brio offers $5 martinis all day Wednesday's and $5 wines all days Thursday's. Give it a try and check it out. They have a big outdoor patio.  See you there!"

We started with the bruschetta sampler I snagged a steak one with tomatoes parm and a nice hint of balsamic that was great the best thing I had that night.  Also got one of tomato and goat cheese ones which were pretty tasty too.  Next a salad with their creamy parm dressing which was balanced very well also.  Just enough cheese, onions, maters it was great.  Some others had the lobster bisque and said it was fishy even to seasoned fish eaters.  On to the pasta they had a fruit of the sea special which was great hint of spicy red pepper flakes a light sauce that didn't drown out the seafood.  I did have one problem with the dish I got 4 mussels maybe 3 oz of fish. Cut to the size of baby scallops and the scallops that were supposed to be in there were AWOL which is probably why the fish was cut that way.  Now the 4 shrimp I got in there were tender tasty and perfectly cooked just like the rest of the seafood were great but for me I would like to see alot more fruit of the sea. Service was friendly but not best I've had.  Overall a good place great tasting food and one of the few places that I've seen give more than a few raviolis in those dishes wanna go back and try the lobster raviolis and if that plate is smaller than mushroom ravioli plate I'm gonna be pissed.\n\nAlso the kids plates are really good and the portions are pretty big."

It was busy, which was expected, but were able to find a perfect little table for two in the bar area. I'm not going to sugar-coat it - once we sat down, we waited for a really long time to get our order taken, to get our wine and bread, and to get our meals. But on busy nights even at good places, things can go wrong - and I'm a firm believer that it is 100% about how staff and management handle themselves. Brio did an excellent job at recovering our experience. Our wine order wasn't put in and we had to flag the manager down after 15 minutes of wondering what was up, but she got our wine to us, and took the glasses off the bill. In fact, while we were having dinner, our server even brought us over two extra glasses. (The wine was delicious, one of their pinot noirs, but I can't remember exactly which one.)\n\nI didn't know what to expect out of our food since I'd never been here, but I was really impressed - the food is so good! I had a hard time deciding between their chicken pesto pomodoro, the pasta alla vodka and the pasta brio, but I decided on the pasta brio (rigatoni, roasted red pepper sauce, mushrooms and grilled chicken) since it's their signature dish and came highly recommended by our server. It was SO delicious and very flavorful - it wasn't spicy but still had the kick I crave! My friend had their chicken pesto over angel hair and didn't really love their pesto- according to our server it isn't true pesto - its base is chicken broth? So maybe that was why. But he ate it and had some of my pasta brio, and we both agreed that dish was incredible.\n\nComing in on such a busy holiday, I think everyone at Brio handled themselves very well, even when there were mishaps. The atmosphere was really nice - had good lighting and seemed sophisticated but also jovial. And you can't beat the location - Tivoli Village is so pretty. I loved our experience here and can't wait to come back and bring my husband!"

They were in an italian mood, but I was limiting carbs due to the night's Yelp Pizza Party, so I did not partake of any pasta during my visit. \n\nService was fairly good- our server was very friendly and made a bunch of helpful chit-chat with us, mostly bonding with my dining companions over their love of carbonara, and discussing the best places in LV to get it. I appreciated his honesty in that he did not try to BS us about how the dish here is the best there is or anything, but he did say it was good- he personally does not like the use of spinach in the dish, preferring beans, but it's not offered that way here.\n\nAs it is, I debated between a few dishes- the shrimp mediterranean in particular, caught my eye. But I ultimately opted for the soup and salad combo, with the wedge and the lobster bisque- the salad arrived already doused in a sea of dressing, which surely took it far beyond the listed calorie counts. The bisque was an odd dish- the first bite wasn't that great to me, and I considered asking to switch it out for the tomato, but as I ate more of the dish it grew on me. Guess I'm just not a lobster bisque person? Duly noted.\n\nMy coworkers both opted for the carbonara- and both were underwhelmed with it. The dishes were huge, and they easily could have shared a single order instead of getting separate dishes, but one dish had overcooked pasta that was borderline mushy while the other was a good al dente. Both ladies were underwhelmed by their selection and had buyer's remorse, of a sort- commenting that they wished they'd gone with their original choices, but felt like the dish would be better here given the conversation with our server. Womp womp.\n\nSeems like this place is best for a happy hour visit- I may need to take advantage of that, but I don't think I'm likely to return for lunch."

As soon as they called his name for the prize, my heart just sank into the bottomless pit of despair. Not to mention the hubs signed me up for their rewards program so I get a coupon now every year for my birthday. \n\nWTF!?!?!? I swear, my hubs hates me. As if it isn't traumatic enough getting 1 year older.\n\nI can't tell you the amount of vitriol I have for Brio Tuscan Grill but that would take way more than the 5000 character limit that Yelp sets out for reviews.\n\nI mean, it's not that the food is absolutely disgusting. It isn't. It's all edible. But that's about it. Considering the exorbitant prices for the level of cuisine, this joint represents all the things that are repellent about dining in the Summerlin area: generic, pricey for what it is, and a hot spot for the geriatric crowd whose taste buds have been ruined by the multitude of meds they take. And don't forget the f*(king patio dining. Like I said, mediocrity at its finest.\n\nIf you must come, come for lunch as the prices are a lot better.\n\nOkay, seeing as I have been forced to eat here more times that I care to, I'll let it loose on a few of the many items I have tried.\n\nLobster bisque ($6.95): too much sherry not enough lobster = pass.\n\nSalads (including Caesar, Grilled Salmon salad) are pretty bad here. Have yet to ever have a salad here without finding some wilted lettuce mixed in. In addition to that, the dressings are all really generic. And what the heck is up with all the cheese they put on everything? What is up with all this gorgonzola? Pass.\n\nCalamari ($10.45/lunch price): First of all, the plating. Have no idea who thought that putting the marinara and cream sauce (neither one which is particularly good), in the same bowl of the fried calamari. This makes all the fried food soggy. Not to mention the deep fried peperoncini represents half of the plate of greasy calamari.\n\nMezza Chicken under the Brick ($14.85/lunch): The roasted chicken is fine, the marsala sauce is decidedly meh. The plate is very small for the $14.85 price tag. \n\nPasta alla vodka ($16.15/lunch): My husband usually gets this. Me, I think it's okay. But given the price and the serving size, it's ridiculous. Pass on this one.\n\nThe only dish I have ever really truly liked there and thought that it was worth it was a special they had. It was a truffle oil flatbread with arugula, mushrooms and proscuitto. They had that for about $10.\n\nGiven that I would likely pass on nearly everything I tried there, I don't recommend coming here as for the above mentioned reasons. Though edible, their food is expensive for what it's worth. 2.5 starred review bumped down to 2 stars."

            "review": "I have discovered that although Tivoli has shops with price tags that make me want to cry, it actually offers a pretty wide selection of reasonable places to eat. Usually we go to Leone, but today I wanted to try Brio because I was craving pasta. \n\nThe ravioli di bello was the perfect dish to satisfy that craving. I wish I had taken better note of what was in it, but basically it was cheesy mushroom ravioli with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and a chardonnay (it might have been some other wine) cream sauce. Yum yum yum yum yum. The flavors were developed very well, and it was indulgent without making me want to take a nap. Most of the items on the menu were within the $15-20 range, so you can have a meal with some friends and not break the bank. \n\nOur waiter was a little pushy when it came to add-ons like appetizers and desserts but it really wasn't that big of a deal. I will definitely be coming back for more!"

He was a very nice waiter and our food and drinks came out fast. The service was great and the food was delicious. The happy hour menu is definitely worth while. We ordered the Brio burger which was perfectly cooked. We also ordered the eggplant fries, spinach artichoke dip,the sausage and pepperoni ricotta flatbread and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. Everything tasted wonderful.

Waited for a solid 10 minutes and finally 2 hostesses came and apologized for the wait. Why are there 2 hostesses if they are BOTH going to be occupied at the same time? Fine whatever.\n\nGot seated outside. We made reservations for 5. Got four plates and sets. I asked for one more set... And I got the \"Oh did I miss a set?\" Yes you did. No biggie. \n\nService is really bad. Not even mediocre, bad. Waited forever to get our orders in, very disappointing. I ordered the lasagna, but 20 mins into it (after we were served calamari and carpacciio, the only decent items on the menu), they came in to let me know they ran out. 20 mins later? Whatever, fine. They told me they could make me a spaghetti with bolognese sauce. I opted for that. Everyone's meal came earlier and they all waited for mine to come out (even though I insisted they go ahead and eat). I finally got this \"bolognese\" but it was like a pasta stew. Everyone knows bolognese is meat sauce and it's not supposed to be mushy and soggy and filled with sauce, but meat. It looked like they threw on the lasagna ragu. It was terrible! Even the meat of the sauce was not edible.\n\nAt this point I was done. My mother insisted that I let them know I didn't get what I ordered. I assumed that my voice wouldn't be heard considered the already bad service... but the Manager was the only redeeming quality of this joint: She offered an apology (that's all I expected), and dessert around the table. She didn't have to do that and that was nice. For that, they get one star.\n\nWithout it, it wouldn't be anything.\n\nI would NOT come back here again and do not recommend this place for anyone who wants a romantic or nice italian experience. Bad food, bad service."

Our food was served pretty quickly, and most importantly, it was delicious. We split an appetizer of bacon and tomato jam bruschetta with ricotta cheese and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I wish I could have taken a jar of that jam home with me. It was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. For my main course I had Gorgonzola-crusted lamb chops. They were cooked medium well, I asked for medium, but they were still great. The Gorgonzola crust was delicious and the mashed potatoes on the side were also quite good. It's a little pricey for brunch, but if you're not on a budget this is an excellent choice."

That is how I feel about the food at Brio.  I have been to the new Tivoli location a few times now and love the happy hour. Be aware that because this is between Kona grill and Sun City, so there is a wide age range.  It had been a while since I had a 65 year old man hit on me, but it wasn't creepy...(is that creepy?).  Service is great each time but if you sit outside the sun just blares down during the happy hour.  The house white wine is nice and light and a reasonable price.  A nice place.

My son came into town, and we picked him up at his hotel on the Strip, and drove the whole way out here because I had bragged on how good it was.  Well,needless to say, the service was terrible.  The food was mediocre.  We were overcharged ($15) on the bill - and we will NOT be back.  The bill was over $100 for 3 people, and the Pasta Brio which is usually quite good was dry, unflavorful, and very disappointing.  My son also ordered the Brio Pasta, based on my previous recommendation, and he did not even finish the dish.  We had to ask fro butter and bread three different times, and never received it. \nAlso, if you are desirous of traditional Bruschetta, do NOT order the Bruschetta Quattro - it is bruschettas with red peppers all over them.  YUK!!  When I order Bruschetta,I want chopped tomatoes, cheese,cilantro and italian seasonings on toasted bread.  \n\nI was embarrassed to have bragged about this restaurant that I have been to MANY times in the past.  However, I would not recommend it to anyone now.  I know my son was disappointed....and it made me sad because I wanted to enjoy a wonderful evening with him.  Shame on Brio for their decline.  We will NOT recommend or be back.  RIP OFF!"

I was raised by a real Italian mama and nothing comes close to her sauce, her meatballs, her pasta dishes. I am terribly critical of most Italian restaurants and therefore am very hard to please. \n\nI will say that Brio Tuscan Grille has thoroughly impressed this Italian palate. I avoided it like the plague when it opened at Town Square, but when it opened at Tivoli I decided to give Brio a chance. One chance!\n\nWell it turned out one chance was all it needed because Brio knocked my Italian socks off. \n\nThe pasta alla vodka was tremendous, with ricotta stuffed pasta in a cheesy cream sauce. The top was sprinkled with pancetta and basil and the dish was large enough to bring some home for lunch.\n\nA friend ordered the lasagna and it was huge - seriously enough for two people.\n\nOn my most recent visit, we decided to hit the bar before heading over for some wine tasting. What a treat we found in that bar....in the form of a $2.95 menu!!! Wow, it was awfully tasty, and with such selections as ravioli caprese, shrimp and eggplant (EXCELLENT) and a gigantic burger. Oh and Wednesday is Martini night - $5 martinis -- yippee!!!!\n\nGood food, good service, good prices. Seriously, what's not to love?"

I had experienced below average service here in the past, but nothing egregious. Knowing this, I had mentally prepared myself for the culinary adventure I was about to undertake... I sat down with a friend at one of the round tables in the bar area. I noticed the same waitress who had been my waitress the other times I had entered the establishment, the very same one who had given shotty service in the past. She was very busy talking to a woman seated at the bar, they appeared to be friends (I made eye contact with her about five times as I waited). I noticed the bar tender as I sat, Making eye contact with this gentleman multiple times. I sat for about 5 minutes, my excitement disappearing by the minute. Again, I made eye contact with the bartender. He went over to the waitress who was still talking to her friend and asked \"are you going to take care of them?\" being busy, she retorted \"that's your job, my tables are all taken care of\". They are arguing loudly, so the patrons in the bar could hear every word, for about 3 minutes. My friend was so embarrassed. Finally, the waitress came over and handed us menus, asked if we wanted waters, and would be back to take our order. We left the establishment. We went across the street to Made LV, and vented to the bartender there about this treatment. He laughed and said he heard it all the time. I wrote an email to the Brio corporate office relating this experience. A couple of days later, brio called, but I missed the call. I called back and spoke to the hostess, who took a message for the manager that I had called back. I received a call from the manager the next day, who apologized and was very sweet,  but also informed me that HER manager wanted to talk to me and apologize. It's been 2 and a half weeks and am still waiting for a call. By the way, first yelp review. \n\n-Russ"

Our server was and always is very friendly and needless to say patient. We're pretty indecisive mainly because every dish is so great. I usually don't step out my comfort zone and try new things but here I have no issue picking something new! Yes, I'm that annoying customer who will ask the server what their favorite dish is. I wanted something spicy so I got a pasta dish and as I write this review I've forgotten the name. The point is though you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. \n\nOne thing I will recommend to fellow yelpers is you have to, HAVE TO try their Spicy Eggplant and Shrimp. Don't let the eggplant part scare you off. I know it's not everyone's first choice but you can't go wrong with this dish. It contains pan seared shrimp, Romano crusted eggplant and the best part the black pepper cream sauce. It'll immediately turn into one of your favorites. \n\nAlso, this location had a great happy hour with live music on the patio!

The walls, decorations, art and overall feel screams Italian countryside, complemented by the bright Vegas sun outside.  \n\nWe ordered one of the chicken sandwiches with the housemade chips, the mezzo chicken \"under the brick\", the grilled chicken risotto with sweet potatoes and I had the grilled shrimp with orzo.  Everything was good.  Nothing the blew us away.  The food is noticeably rich with butter and salt (fair warning for those looking for lighter, healthier choices) and is served in smallish portions perfect for lunch.  My family really enjoyed the housemade chips which were not salty at all and perfectly crisp.  \n\nThis place might have gotten an extra star if the service had been a little bit more personable and organized.  The waitress was friendly but she came back after our order and handed me a Caesar salad.  I looked back at her in confusion.  \"I didn't order a salad.\"  \"Yes, you did.  This is yours.\"  My aunt spoke up and said it was hers and she apologized but if I told her I didn't order it, I thought that should have been it.  \n\nBy the time we started eating, my mother still didn't have her side salad.  The waitress told us it would be right out.  After she'd brought it out, Mom said the girl dropped it on the table and said \"here you are\" while already looking to the next table and moving on.  Since she believes that service includes making eye contact with your customers when you are engaging with them, I'm mentioning it here.  \n\nOtherwise, it was a good experience.  It's reaosnably close to Summerlin, but I think we'll continue exploring other Italian options before returning."
