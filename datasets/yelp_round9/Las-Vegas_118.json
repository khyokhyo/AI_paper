My wife took for Father's Day this Sunday. No wait went right it around 9. The valley was about to shut down for the night. We started of with a new dish to there menu but definitely not new to us tuna tartar, it was awesome really fresh nothing out of the ordinary in it."

I love beef, S&W serve awesome dry aged beef, match made in heaven right? Wrong.... 1) they got rid of the rosemary bread and replaced it with pretzel...lame..2) Apparently this fine establishemt charges for  water however they don't charge the parade of half dressed tweens to use the bathroom, I'm not kidding about 10 walked past the  table to come in and pee and leave...and I have to pay for euro trash water?? 3) waitstaff, i have to pay $60 for a steak to hear you bs with the other staff?!?! go in the back..... you made my poor excuse for a drink in 60 seconds perhaps you could have spent a little less time staring at the 16 year olds cut of shorts and put a little more effort in my drink. 4) steak was over cooked and small. 5) worst lunch experience ever....I expected so much more. We had a good run S&W, it was good while it lasted...Now to find a new Vegas steak house, any suggestions?"

The waiter brought the manager over but he didn't care and said the steaks are not trimmed.  That doesn't explain the lack of taste.  Hubby is from Kansas City so he knows good steaks.  This was not one of them and for $49 it should have been better.  Restaurant doesn't care about their customers and we won't be back.  Unfortunately, this was our anniversary.  Hubby couldn't eat it.  Waiter was attentive and good.  Not his fault meat was terrible."

Luckily I didn't have to pay for this meal! haha\n\nSat in the bar area as the dining room is a bit too formal for my liking.\n\nOrdered the Wollensky Burger and its still one of the best burgers in town to me. A classic done right and simple. Bacon, cheese, lettuce on a pretzel bun. Delicious.\nEveryone seemed to enjoy their respective dishes. Some sides we had were fries, onion rings and the deliciously amazing Truffled Mac and Cheese.\n\nWish they had a few more beers on tap, but the Alaskan Ale was pretty good. Great staff, clean restrooms and great food. Can't beat that!"

            "review": "I've always liked going to this steakhouse because of the way the steaks are cut and the quality is worth what you are paying for. Both the Boston and LV locations are quality. Get the dry aged steak selections if you go here. The service is great even when it's busy. We got a Bordeaux blend red from Spain and it was  nice and light but with enough tartness to cut the fatty taste off the bone in ribeye. It is also one of the cheaper wines on the menu. Spanish wines are way less expensive than how much these guys are selling them for... the wines in the list are def not cheap at this place with the markup quite high. The truffled mac and cheese is indeed crack like the other reviews mentioned. I would try the house red wine someday."

Have been to the S&W in Chicago, and S&W always seems to execute a handsome experience. \n\nExtensive, impressive wine list. Had a 2000 Lohr cab - best cab I've ever had. \n\nOrdered the surf and turf - lobster did not disappoint - a beautiful 1.25lb. lobster - v. fresh and sweet. Medium rare filet mignon was well-prepared to order but found it on the bland side (prefer Jean-Georges' Prime steakhouse). \n\nTruffled mac & cheese - pure indulgence, incredible truffle flavor - coworkers would come to S&W for this alone. Personally prefer the crustier cavatini-based lobster mac at Capital Grille.\n\nWere out of prime rib to friend's dismay.\n\nDesserts were surprisingly average - apple tart was fine but not extraordinary. Pecan pie was oddly sweetly spiced, didn't care for the crust."

            "review": "This was a nice option for a restaurant that doesn't scream \"Vegas\". Our party of four stopped by after an event without reservations on a Sunday night and 10 minutes later we were seated on the patio with a nice view of all the guys handing out escort cards. Besides the \"view\", good food for what I had. I wasn't feeling a large meal so I ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad, crab cake, and split calamari. Our table split a bottle of wine. \n\nAs someone else mentioned, the rolls are amazing. The calamari was very good, as was their tarter sauce seasoning. It did bother me the calamari didn't come with a lemon, so we had to ask for one, and the dish was a bit cold by the time we got our garnish. The crab cake was good, and expensive (I believe about $13 for one crab cake), but nothing to write home to my Maryland peeps about. The mozzarella and tomato salad was very good! Huge slices of tomato and generous portions of fresh mozzarella...very good!\n\nA great stop-in place in Vegas without the hassle of a big name, star chef restaurant. Prepare to drop some dough for a full meal."

My mouth was watering when the waiter opened the lid.  The prime rib looked so yummy and juicy.  However both the burger and prime rib were disappointing.  Both lacked major flavor.  Too bland.  We also had a side of creamed spinach.  Again, lacked flavor and basic salt.  The only thing I enjoyed was the split pea soup.  That was really good and hearty.  Service was standard.  I will not be returning here based on the food.  Too many restaurants in Vegas to try."

The sides were substantial and nice takes on classics.  Had the green beans, which were perfectly al-dente and tossed with cashews and top-quality blue cheese.   Delicious.  The decor and atmosphere is \"old New York\" and can be boisterous; but that's part of the charm.  My only regret is the portions were so large, that I did not have room for dessert."

Sounds like a pretty good deal for a \"high end\" steakhouse, right?  Welll....\n\nI started with the split pea soup which was supposed to be famous. It was ok.  Pea Soup Andersen doesn't have to worry about competition.  \n\nThe steak was disappointing.  It was \"Steak and Frites\".  Last time I checked, frites means \"fries\" in restaurant term.  I think I got dehydrated fried potato chip strips from a can... like the fried onion strings you get for Thanksgiving on the bean casserole?  And the steak was like a teriyaki type skirt steak cut in strips, not a whole steak.  \n\nSorry but I think the Liquid Lunch was very overrated, and lucky my drink came with it... $4 for an 8 ounch diet coke bottle (no refills) is a joke.  Over rated, and lucky to get 2 stars from me.  \n\nMeh! I have experienced much better for lunch at other higher end steakhouses for about the same price.\n\nThe good part was we had a groupon, so we saved some money on lunch."

            "review": "I wish I were rich & powerful because I would most certainly make backroom deals where I kept \"the man down.\"  Where those deals would be made?  Smith & Wollensky.  This steakhouse epitomizes an old-school, clubby atmosphere where one discusses the latest issue of the New Yorker.  Their Las Vegas outpost is an amazing respite from the invasion of over priced, modern fancy steak joints that have become omnipresent on the strip.  \n\nWhere to start on what makes Smith & Wollensky great?  Ive already touched on the amazing vibe they've created, but the food is just as good.  The meat is Prime and cooked expertly.  I love that they dont drown their cuts in butter like some other top-end places and they make the meat the real star.  Ive had the Bone-In Ribyeye twice now and I can say its nothing short of breathtaking.  My associate swears by the Filet Oscar style (how great is it that they still do an Oscar style?  Old school, I told you) and judging by the bites I had I concur.  The sides are bold yet traditional and complimentary with the rest of the menu.  If you're only ordering one, it MUST be the truffle mac & cheese.  Thumbs up also to the creamed spinach, hash browns & lobster mashed potatoes.  As for starters, I always get their crisp iceberg wedge salad which is the best of any restaurant not named Gibson's in Chicago.  Ive never had the deserts there because with all the other food, who can?  Judging from the rest of the dining room, it looks like that is a popular sentiment.  \n\nThe service is attentive yet unobtrusive.  Our waiter Michael knows the menu inside out and was helpful with the wine menu as well.  What a treat to have a waiter who treats the food as a passion instead of job.  Im sure they other staff our amazing too, but if you can Michael will make your dinner very special in that you wont even realize he made it special.  See how that works?\n\nWith all these nice touches comes a hefty price tag, but S & W delivers.  Expect that each person will be about $100 bucks with some alcohol.  \n\nToo bad the only back-room deals I usually make here is how to get my friend to treat...."

And every year, I get disappointed.  Until this year.  I really like this place.  As always, the only cut I get is the Ribeye.  Much better than a Filet Mignon.  The perfect amount of marbling gives you a more tender and flavorful cut.  And the only way to eat it is Medium Rare.  This place delivered.  I had the Cajun seasoned cut.  It was cooked perfectly and the spices were not overbearing but perfectly seasoned.  I hope I can convinced my buddies to repeat.  Biggest complaint from them was that the steaks were undercooked.  Big sissies."

            "review": "Valentine's Day dinner 2K15. I'll remember this one because there's a story to tell.\n\nGot a reservation for 2 at Smith & Wollensky. I drive by the restaurant every so often and always say I've got to try that place. So we did. Besides trying to make a right into the driveway off of Las Vegas Blvd (tons and tons of walkers crossing the driveway), once you make it over, they've got a nice valet waiting for you. You literally get out of your car and you walk right into the restaurant.\n\nWe walk in and the first thing that grabs my attention is a wedding party enjoying their reception dinner. I thought, that's cool. So we check in and the host escorts us to a cozy table adjacent to the wedding party. After sitting down for a couple minutes, one of the guests from the wedding party is heard having a good time, ranting/raving about stuff...we figure he's feelin' good, no worries. But as the minutes go by, we hear him raising his voice, ranting across the table to the bride or groom, using profanities. I take a little peak (as my back was facing him), and this dude is totally faded and wearing a Yankee ball cap and jeans. I look around and everyone else is either suited n booted or in business casual, including myself. \n\nSo after the waiter greeted us and went over the menu, we (and others around us in this part of the dining room) were subjected to not only this inebriated ghetto knucklehead, but the bride AND groom got in on the action about how slow service was and that they were going to leave and go to IN N OUT. \n\nI inconspicuously made my way over to the host and told her what was going on and requested to move. (Honestly i was thinking chances were zero of moving b/c it was Valentine's Day and the place was booked). But Gina, the host, immediately apologized on the restaurant's behalf and found us a table upstairs with no hesitation.\n\nHere's the kicker: as we got up to move and had to walk right past the wedding party, many people from the party started taunting us. It was weird b/c all of a sudden me and my wife were the center of attention while we were leaving. We didn't make eye contact nor engage with those crazy people.\n\nWe got upstairs and sat in a beautiful table overlooking the Strip. The night turned from \"Oh my God\" to what we had expected...a nice quiet Valentines Dinner. This incident and the way in which the staff handled it prompted me to give them 5-stars. They were extremely polite, professional, and apologetic. I felt for them in dealing with that nasty wedding party, especially in an establishment like this, but oh well...it happens from time to time.\n\nTo finish my review and not to diminish the other parts of this dining experience, I'll keep it short and sweet:\nService: impeccable...some of the best customer service I've ever had\nFood: as expected...excellent filet mignon and wild mushrooms\nAmbiance: perfect (upstairs, of course)\nPrice: once again, as expected. This is fine dining with fine dining prices. Oh, and I think our waiter didn't charge us for the $20 martini maybe b/c of the initial incident. \nThank you Smith & Wollensky. It was a memorable night."

The steaks are huge, the service is top notch, and, best of all, there is no corkage fee!  For any of you wine lovers out there this should be a big deal to you.  You can open that First-Growth Bordeaux, or Napa Cabernet Sauvignon with a great steak and not have to pay $35 just to get it opened and poured for you!  I don't know about you, but this is a big deal for me!  The only other place on the strip that has free corkage is Pinot Brasserie at the Venetian (all of Splichal's restaurants do).  \n\nI suggest one steak because it's what I get at every steakhouse: Bone-in Ribeye.  It's like two meals in one.  The juicy steak, and the flavorful bone!  The sides did not impress me too much, but the steak, service, and free corkage bring it up far enough to make it a 5 stars!  \n\nIf you're looking for a great steak in a classic steakhouse atmosphere with great service then Smith & Wollensky's is your place."

It was more tender and perfectly cooked. The 28 day dry aging added the perfect flavor. The side dishes are also much larger portions at S&W. It's enough for two people to share compared to Flemings.

So if you want a good well rounded meal give this place a try."

            "review": "Amazing fillet.  They offer a few different styles of preparation for your fillet.  I ordered the Gorgonzola.  It was fantastic.  The beef would have been great even without the Gorgonzola.  Somebody at the table ordered the Rib-eye.  He was in heaven as well.  One person ordered a lesser steak (sirloin).  He was not satisfied, but knowing this person, I attribute this to bad taste buds and not the restaurant's fault. Steaks were about $35-$45 each.\nMost of the side dishes were very good.  The creamed spinach was excellent.  The asparagus was also very good (and enough to feed a small country).  I was very disappointed with the mashed potatoes.  I expected them to be better.  Somebody at my table ordered french fries.  They were pretty good.  WARNING: each side dish feeds at least 2 people, so don't order too many (like we did).  Side dishes were about $12 each.\nWe also ordered creme brulee for dessert.  Not a big fan of creme brulee.  It was ok.\nTotal bill for 6 people = over $350; my share (2 people) = $165 (tip included).  So make sure you don't spend all of your money at the casinos beforehand.\nNot sure if reservations are required, but we had one just to be safe.\nS&W will definitely be a stop everytime I am in Las Vegas."

We had to catch up with the rest of our group later that evening, and this was right across the street.\n\nSo...I got a nice big filet, \"simply grilled, au poivre.\" The sauce was pretty good. I had higher expectations for the beef. I mean, HOW COULD A RESTAURANT OF THEIR SUPPOSED REPUTE RUIN A 28-DAY DRY-AGED TENDERLOIN STEAK? Easy. By not cooking it right. \"Medium\" does not mean \"charred extra well.\" It means cooked through, but with a juicy pinkness starting, oh, about a third of the depth into the cut of the meat. Did they electrocute it on the MGM's marquee? Just not good at all.\n\nI got a side order of asparagus. It was overdone too. Maybe the chef was also our waiter, because (ok, the guy seemed to be an amiable dude) he seemed to be held hostage by an obnoxious party of bogans sitting next to us who were trying to pick up on some Dutch chicks sitting in our proximity. You do not pick up on Dutch chicks by speaking bad German because that isn't their language. Germans might think it's OK, but that's another story, for another place and another time...\n\nSo, all the while this was happening, our food was getting BURNT!\n\nThe steak that my buddy got was equally horrendous, by his report. So it wasn't just me.\n\nNow that we'd filled our bellies with some atrociously mutilated animal flesh, it was time to get the check.\n\nTime...ticking away...Helllooooo Maytag repairman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAnd those goons next to us were still trying to hit on those Dutch chicks using bad German pick-up lines, holding our waiter hostage (maybe they were really just trying to impress him?).\n\nAll I could think was, \"Jullie hebben de dommekloote rukkeren, shut the F--- up and let me get the waiter's attention so I could get my check.\" I may even have said that out loud while flailing about trying to get said waiter's attention.\n\nI took matters into my own hands, went inside, and asked the host to get me the check. No problem.\n\nTime...flies...when...you're...having...fun...\n\nAt this point, we were tempted just to leave without paying. And just as we were about to do so, the check came, oh, about 38 minutes after it was first solicited.\n\nNot good. In fact, that made some bad food taste even worse. The price was on par with what one would expect to pay at a restaurant of the caliber one would get the impression of this being, not having actually dined there. Expensive doesn't necessarily mean high-class.\n\nOh, yeah, and I guess they thought those pretzel bites with honey mustard in lieu of some good crusty French bread were cute. No. I'm at a steakhouse. Not 7-11."

The salads were fresh, but skimpy with the veggies, just lots of lettuce.  The vegetarian choice was pasta primavera, so, rather than having cream-drenched pasta, I ordered the tuna, which was fabulous- fresh, not overcooked, melt in your mouth tender, accompanied by the lightest Wasabi sauce.  Sides were creamed spinach (ok) and garlic mashed potatoes (average).   Dessert was a heavy cheesecake.  All in all, outstanding tuna, but the remainder was average at best.  Disappointing compared to the downtown Chicago Smith and Wollensky.  If someone else weren't buying, I don't think I would return."

What you really go here for are the New York and the Rib Eye.  Also, if they have the king crab legs on the night that you go, those are really good too.  Other highlights are the Wollensky salad and the truffled mac & cheese (Mmmmmmmm.).  The portions tend to be epic.  Basically, if your a vegan or a male who takes longer than five minutes on his hair in the morning you're going to hate this place.

Service was poor and neglectful, with some personnel poorly groomed.  Cadaveric managers hovered around the tables, but did little to help staff.  The corkage policy abruptly changed, costing us more.  Lamb chops were unseasoned as far as I could tell.\n\nMy advice, look elsewhere.

Let me just say that I didn't even finish my dinner, but I was so stuffed afterwords that my mom and I could not even go to the Celine Dion show, we just went back to our hotel and passed out. I don't know what they put in their food but I had the WORST food hangover, like the kind where you keep tossing and turning during the night and having nightmares about eating. Taste-wise, everything tasted alright, nothing special though. The steak was cooked as I asked, but for $60 they'd better cook it as I asked. The caesar salad sucked, I expected better from a steakhouse. My mom and dad ordered lamb chops and they said it was good. My brother and husband got steaks like me, they said it was alright. Let me just say though, the staff was the RUDEST staff I have ever experienced in any restaurant. The host snapped at me when I told him we had an open table reservation, and said \"don't worry about it, the rest of your party is already here\". I explained to him that I wanted him to take care of the opentable reservation, and he snapped at me and said he would (HE NEVER DID!) Our waiter was impatient when we asked questions and recommendations. His assistant, another girl waitress, was SO rude. She acted like I asked her to move a mountain when I asked her for a to-go box. During the meal, I spilled a little wine on myself, and it took them about 45 minutes to get me a napkin. If this was a diner, FINE, but this is a $$$$$ restaurant and my dad had a $800 tab, which means you are getting a $160 tip out of default. Don't act like you are entitled to it or something!"

It is well known in New York as the first new steak house that had opened in quite sometime.\n\nThey got their name by picking the two names out of a phone book . The chain was founded by the founders of TGI Fridays, and there in lies the problem.\n\nIn New York, if an establishment turns out a mediocre product, they are done. Not so in Las Vegas, where tourists are too excited to notice they are paying top dollar for sub par food and service,and this place is a good example. \n\nI've eaten here three times, and three strikes and you're out!\n\nOne time I hosted a business function with 20 people. Some were from New York, and were truly disappointed. Two other times were intimate social occasions, and both times I was disappointed.\n\nOn the last occasion, I ordered a rib eye. It was 95% fat. I told the waiter my steak had too much fat, he just said \"Yes\", and did nothing. \n\nWhen I complained to the manager, he offered to buy desert and drinks, but \"the damage was done\". \n\nHere's the bottom line; Smith & Wollensky is a Rich Man's Black Angus.\n\nRead my review of Del Frisco's.  It's not that NYC atmosphere, but you'll walk away with a better steak. Trust me!!"

The straight forward menu and service is classic and practical. Not much on the menu is extremely innovative, but it is solid.\n\nThe drinks menu is dominated by items made with ginger beer. I got a Lima Mule and it was light and refreshing. It uses Cacha\u00e7a, a liquor fermented from sugarcane. I wished more places carry it because it tastes so much better than rum.\n\nOur first course was a caprese salad. The heirloom tomatoes were vibrant, but had little flavor to them. The mozzarella cheese was the integral aspect of the whole dish. It was fresh, creamy and slightly sweet. I could have just eaten a plate full of that and basil alone. \n\nAs for our entrees we decided to upgrade to the 10oz filet for an additional $10. It was worth getting. They offer all prime meats and the steaks were grilled well. I got mine topped with the foie gras mushroom ragout. I did not get much of the foie flavor, but it was a tasty sauce. True to most steakhouses, no sides came with it. We ordered the truffle mac and cheese and it was spot on when it came to flavor. The only down side was the texture of the pasta. It was cooked for too long and lost the necessary bite. The butternut squash gorgonzola dish was decent. The cheese just over powered everything else. \n\nThe chocolate cake was shockingly light. I was stuffed by the end of the entree, but I kept eating the cake. \n\nI am not sure if I would go back to Smith & Wollensky's because it is not one of the top tiers when it comes to steakhouse."

I believe you can only get to it if you are northfound on Las Vegas Blvd.\n2)Their well drinks are NOT good. I had asked for a signature drink at the bar and the bartender had no idea what I was talking about. Stick with the wines at this place.\n3)Pretty much a steak only place, not much of other selections. Well, you shouldn't come here if  you want salad. \n\nHere are the postives:\n1)The service was really good. We had a lady named Luciana and we had a party of ten. Everyone was very satisfied.\n2)The steak here is one of the best! Probably on my list of top three. \n3)They made something so simple and so good. \n\nI didn't give them 5 stars mainly because we still have to wait a bit even when we had reservations. Getting out on the strip, well you know how that is too but I will be back!"

One shining moment here was the politeness and pleasantness of the waiter who was very accomodating."

What really pulled me in was the different \"enhancements\" you could get with your steak and after seeing that on their menu this place needed to happen.  \n\nThe wife and I went on a Tuesday so there wasn't a lot of people around and I didn't really look around to much to see if there was any additional seating besides the main area.  I've always hated going to restaurants that don't seat you right away and instead turn you to the bar area even though there's plenty of seating available...sorry but i came here to eat steak not socialize at the bar.  This place didn't do that +1!  The host was very professional as well at the wait staff.  They were always coming around checking up on us, which was pretty nice.\n\nSo we decided to order the Filet Mignon with blue cheese on the side as well as Truffled Mac and Cheese.  After a while the food came out and we started to dig in.  I gotta say, hand down one of the best steaks I've ever had.  The Truffle Mac and Cheese was just right, not too overpowering but really spot on for taste.  The blue cheese side with the steak made it even better...I was even trying to mix the left over cheese from the mac with my steak, just as good as the blue cheese. \n\nOverall this place blew my mind.  I figured this place was going to be good, I didn't expect it to top my list of steakhouses.  If I have one bad thing to so about this place it would be why do you have to be so far from San Francisco!"

My Yorkshire pudding was dry and unremarkable at best (and also creeped out my friend because he said it looked like a baby arm [SOMEONE is projecting!]). I was so disappointed as I am a steak fanatic who has embraced all sorts of steak ranging from the low-pro diner set-up to the high-end, formal-attire establishments in the most pretentious nooks and crannies of both coasts and beyond. Smith and Wollensky, however, failed miserably and has no place in my steak-consuming repertoire. I went to some sketchy hotel diner the next morning with the rest of my hungover constituents and my $13 steak and eggs dwarfed Smith and Wollensky in terms of edibility and taste. \n\nService-wise, the staff was top-notch and being that we were a rough and tumble bachelor party, the host graciously placed us in the VIP room in which we were consistently and diligently pampered. I can't justify dropping fifty bucks on a shit steak, but the service evened it out.\n\nThe triple-baked mac and cheese was a little too salty and overpowering. Come to think of it, everything was too salty. I had three greyhounds and I didn't feel the urge to shred my carcass any harder than if I'd had a glass of warm milk. \n\nA bad steak makes for a very unhappy Stephie. I came up big time in the casino later that night so financially speaking, I managed to break even with our hefty bill, but the psychological and emotional scars inflicted by that prime rib will forever remain in the distant recesses of my fragile constitution. A 500-pound animal died scared shitless and without warning for you, dudes. Show the poor beast a modicum of justice and at least serve him right."

All of these locations are pretty much mirror images of each other as far as building appearance, and similar in size.  I guess that's how a chain or mini-chain, in this case, operates.\n\nThis place was similar in food as well although I think I've had better food before elsewhere.  I had the prime rib which to me was not worth the price.  The cut was fattier than most, and wasn't bone-in which I've seen and had at the other locations. \n\nI was here Memorial day weekend at lunch as a walk-in.  They asked if I had a reservation even though the restaurant was fairly empty looking to me.  Service was good, the food was good.  They recommended the house mac and cheese which I thought was excellent.  Baked potatoes were huge and served with all the fixings you could want on the side, so you can build it the way you want it.  I gave their own Smith & W wine brand a try and thought it was very tasty.  My buddy got the cajun rib-eye which he found excellent and even said he liked the steak here better than Ruth Chris's.\n\nTo me, I've had better deals.  This place is good and I would go back, but the main reason we came here was because most of the Vegas steakhouses don't open until 5pm, and when you want steak you want it NOW.  S & W, lower the prices a bit and I'll be here every day.  Enough already."

It was a sight to behold as over 200 people traipsed from our hotel, down the side walk, through the cross walk and up the other side of the street to the Eatery. People were stopping and staring and I couldn't help but giggle some. \n\nThe location is directly across the street from the Monte Carlo Hotel, and it's a lovely 3 story building, white and gray, it appears spartan on the outside, but on the inside its decorated with dark woods, nautical decor and photographs.  \n\nWe were taken to a holding area on the 2nd floor, where drinks and apps were passed. Since I was squeezed into a small corner, I didn't get to try everything, but what I did try - the crab cake - was absolutely decadent, and by now, you know how I feel about sea food. I also got a Rum & Diet, and it appears they only were using top shelf. (ooh la la - so didn't want to see the bill for liquor.. sheesh)\n\nWe were then brought into our room and seated, long tables where everyone was seated into different group. Friends sat with friends if they got in early enough, or if you were like my husband and myself, you sat where you could. We ended up at a table where he knew a few people and I made a few new friends, including the Estonian support group. \n\nThe food was delicious. We started with red or white wine, and bread was offered to the table, they were decadent little rolls topped with garlic butter, served in what I can only describe as Monkey bread style. Then our salads came around, crisp ceasar salads topped with almost literal sheets of parmigan cheese and a crustini that had an olive tepanade on it - this was delicious. \n\nThe mains were a choice of a Fillet Mignon, a Stuffed Chicken breast or Pasta Alfredo. My own personal choice was the fillet, served Medium, with a side of mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  It was decadent, you could totally cut the steak with your butter knife, and the meat was - I don't know the spice blend but lordy, it was melt in your mouth amazing.  The sides were so good as well. \n\nDessert was New York style cheesecake, though for me, I didn't find that it was exactly New York style, it was lighter, fluffier... It would have been made better with either caramel or chocolate.. otherwise it was a tasty end to the meal, when paired with rich Lavasa Coffee.  YUM."

However, when we walked out around 8:15 PM, the place was packed. \n\nThe interior is old-school steakhouse, dim lighting, etc. It's like 1910 elegance, you know, before the stock market crashed and people stood in line for a piece of bread. The plush, cushy chairs are perfect for sitting back and stuffing your face with indulgent food and delicious steaks.\n\nOur server was cordial and had a light sense of humor. I have a feeling since we were a group of young ladies his demeanor was a tad different from what he would have presented had we been three businessmen. Of course, that's not a problem for the waitstaff to be versatile. \n\nFood - I ordered off the RW menu, a fixed price of $40 (and some change). I received the Wollensky Salad - a salad with crisp romaine lettuce, served with warm, large chunks of bacon and mushrooms. Also - tomatoes.. um, two tomatoes to be exact. Is there a problem with tomatoes lately? Seems as though they appear sparser and sparser in my salads at restaurants. The salad was good, and filling. \n\nDeconstructed Beef Wellington with Foie Gras. (Originally $42). This meal comes out very simplistic on a large white plate. Along with the meat you receive three slender carrots and three slender asparagus. The meat is cooked medium-rare, which I said yes to because I have never had beef wellington so I decided to go with the recommendation. The \"deconstruction\" part is the fact that the beef wellington is served differently than normal, but with all the elements still there. The meat is cut up, the foie gras is not wrapped around all of the meat, and the puff pastry is on the bottom of the meat, more like a platter than a wrapper, which is what is normal. Overall I enjoyed the dish, the meat was simply divine and I did not have a chewy bit. I did run into a few bits of overcooked foie gras, being that it was a bit crunchy. Typically I do not eat my meat medium rare and I found the fact that the meal came out much cooler than I'm used to a bit strange at first, but perhaps something I can stomach when eating a beef wellington in the future.\n\nChocolate cake - chocolate meh. I wasn't impressed. I've had much better cake elsewhere, but obviously desserts is not their forte. Skip dessert, go somewhere else after your meal. Or just have another cocktail instead.\n\nCocktails - I had two of the same, something called  French martini. Very girly and pink. Swirly, swirly! I liked it, no complaints.\n\nSides (not included on RW Menu) - We decided to get two sides to share between the three of us. We went for the truffled mac n cheese and the mushrooms. Mushrooms to me were all right. But since I had had mushrooms on my salad and I had mushrooms with the beef wellington I only had a spoonful of them. The mac and cheese though - heaven! Perfectly creamy, just enough of a breading on top for a crunch, and just straight up gooey goodness that is sooo bad for you, but it's soooo good. \n\nFor the RW 2013 S&W gets a 4-star rating. Now, would I return to pay full price? Yes, I think I would. I also like that they have a lunch menu, something I would love to explore. Also, currently when you check-in with Yelp you can receive a deal, so that is always a plus for us Yelpers!\n\nGood job S&W and thank you for a fabulous meal."

The service is normally very good and unobtrusive but on this occasion I felt our waiter was a little pushy, for example he tried to steer us to bottle water rather than tap. Maybe it was a slow night for tips or something. The food as always was amazing so that didn't disappoint.\n\nAt the end of the evening we went to the valet and asked them to order us a taxi, there were 6 of us. They immediately started to sell us on getting a limo which would be about the \"same cost\" as a normal taxi. We got guilted into accepting and paid $40 for a $15 cab ride. (Incidentally the driver then had the cheek to ask for a tip!) The driver immediately went into \"sleazy Vegas cab driver\" mode and started to try and get us to go to clubs, bars and even a strip club - where he will get referral fees I presume. This was totally unacceptable before you consider we were a mixed group. I would have given more stars but I felt the latter part of the evening sullied the dining experience."

            "review": "We were told great things about this restaurant from a family member and thought we should make reservations for dinner during our stay in Las Vegas.\n\nOverall, our food was not worth the price tag. We asked our waiter for recommendations on wine, appetizers/salads, steaks, etc. His knowledge of the menu didn't seem to be what I was expecting and it seemed like he didn't know what the popular items at the restaurant were. \n\nOur salads were nothing over the top that we couldn't do ourselves. Honestly, every steakhouse I've had a salad or soup at is always one of a kind. Take it from someone who ate her fair share of steaks in the South! All of our steaks were overcooked from the temperature we asked for. Our wine was more dry and not as sweet as we had expected. I felt that our dessert might have been the only good part to our meal, which wasn't recommended by him, but we read through popular reviews. \n\nIt was very disappointing to have the level of service that we did and I had hoped it would have been more accommodating to someone who was a vegetarian. I know what you're thinking, why would a vegetarian show up to a steakhouse. However, you'd be surprised how accommodating many are willing to be for someone who would like a little more than just a side dish. While I don't expect chefs to create a new meal, to make an added effort/detail to a side dish would have been nice. It also didn't help that our waiter seemed like he was rushing to close up our bill rather than having us enjoy a nice meal. \n\nOverall our experience, was a complete bust. We've experience better steakhouses in Vegas that have been much more accommodating and notable for their service and food. I definitely wouldn't recommend this steakhouse to people in the future.\n\nI felt the reason they should get one more star is for extra effort in the complimentary glass of prosecco they served us for our anniversaries and taking picture of us from my iphone."

Yes that was my best man with 4 cans of diet red bull in his pockets so he could \"save money\" and get more vodka.  I'm not sure how that all worked out for him but at least he felt pleased with it.  \n\nDinner was good.  Most of the guys had steak.  I think there might have been a sissy fish or chicken mixed in.  Another buddy, Adrian, showed up late after disappearing (no, not for a good reason) because he had just spent 24 straight hours on a poker roller coaster.  He managed to replenish his system for the nights events ahead.  Amazing.  \n\nI think the cost was about what you'd expect from a Morton's or any other nice steakhouse.

I also enjoy cooking steaks myself and have geeked out on the details on cuts and cooking techniques.  I know steaks.  And I know a prime filet mignon shouldn't leave you spitting out chunks of jello-like, crunching, unchewable gristle.  Heck, an Outback Steakhouse filet shouldn't do that - it's a filet!\n\nI wasn't going to say anything at first since I was enjoying my meal with my (very drunk) friend (I was sober).  But then I got some backbone and realized I'm paying real money for this and should give them the chance to give me a good experience.  \n\nThe waiter, then the manager, were condescending pr*cks.  \"Sir, you don't understand what a fine steak is like.  A better steak has fat inside it that provides flavor ...\".  Marbling is Steak 101 - if THEY knew what a fine steak is like they'd know marbling is thin streaks of fat that dissolve during cooking, and that a filet has very low fat anyways.  Seeing my drunk friend, he obviously assumed I was also drunk and made me feel like we were lowlifes doing a once-in-a-lifetime splurge and not understanding steaks; or making it up as a form of dine-and-dash (despite the chunks of fat in my napkin).\n\nEventually, he rolled his eyes and agreed to take some money off the bill, clearly just to get away and not out of courtesy or understanding.  I left upset, hungry, and with less money in my wallet.\n\nThis was a while ago and I've talked every group I've been with in Vegas since into going somewhere else, and never gone to S&W anywhere else either.

I made the reservation about 2 1/2 months before arriving.  \n\nI hate opening up with a complaint, but it sticks out the most.  Maybe others give it high stars but not every customer is satisfied the same.\n\nWe checked in and were seated at a round table for six in a corner near the front door/bar. I asked for the vacant longer table for six; round tables are hard to do with 3 BIG guys. I was told it was already reserved; when I called a week before I was told you couldn't reserve a specific table...odd. I asked for something else but were told that's all that was avaialble; this was at 7:30pm; reasturants in Las Vegas usually don't get crazy until 830/930pm, as they did in this case. There was no luck, even after kindly asking several times and expressing that we were there first (by at least 25/30mins). No dice, and the host wasn't even considerate, borderline rude about it. This is a large place, it's bullsh*t that he couldn't help us out.  Again, there were 3 big guys at the table in a corner with a lot of food on the table...not fun.  We tried to make the best of it.\n\nBesides the the two parties of about 10 or more, the ambiance was bright and loud.  Maybe that's typical of seating next to the kitchen, front door and bar.\n\nOur server was friendly, and very helpful. We had a lot of questions and he was a pro.  Steaks were tasty; I had the Oscar style filet which had crap meat on it in a very rich and heavy sauce.  Sides for two come in small pots right off the grill; mashed potatos were watery and had no flavor...I mentioned this but was told simply \"sorry about that.\" Creamed spinish and mushrooms are great, very happy with those; I'm not all complaints and complimented that and the steak. \n\nIt's not really business casual when people are wearing t-shirts and shorts.  We had on nice jeans and collars shirts...and weren't nearly as loud and obnoxious as the idiots next to us.  Hard to really enjoy the dinner with them; I didn't expect anyone to say anything to them either. Prices are somewhat typical...$49 for a small fillet (looks like little food but its filling especially with a salad and sides).\n\nThis S & W is a bit of a novelty (maybe because it's in Las Vegas).  I've been to many steak houses around the country and this one seems to be the least exciting.  I prefer dim light and class compared to this bright, fast passed mess hall sounding place.  Next time I'll try somewhere else and not recommend this."

My review is not to recommend a particular cut of steak or impress you with my encyclopedic knowledge of mixed drinks--I'm sure there's plenty of yelp reviews for that.\n\nHere are my points:\n1) For a special occasion, request the Chef's Table.  You get to see inside the bustling kitchen, and you can shut the door, so people can't eavesdrop on your fascinating conversations.  I'm actually not sure how this reservation works since someone else booked it--I was just there to join in on the good times!!!\n\n2) Request Eddie as your server :)  Eddie was very warm and friendly, and he made us feel right at home.  He went the extra mile to make sure the Bachelorette's glass was always at least 1/2 full.  It's actually kind of magical that Eddie would just show up and refill all of our drinks :)  I think that's probably the most important thing when partying in Vegas, esp a Bachelorette--the drinks shall over-floweth.  Eddie was also very knowledgeable about the menu--the creamed spinach and lobster truffle Mac and cheese were ah-mazing!!!!!  Thank you Eddie for helping to make my friend's bachelorette a SUCCESS!!!!\n\n3) Also a special shout out to the Bartender--I'm sorry I do not know your name, but your drinks are awesome!!!!"

The service was amazing, our waiter was quite attentive and the servers w/ the hors d'\u0153uvres were friendly. The hors d'\u0153uvres were awesome, bite sized but not invisible specks of food. We had mini cheese burgers, chickeny pizza, tomato basil pizza, and shrimp. The chicken pizza was teh best, it was a mix of flavors-chicken, parmesan, garlic with a light crisp dough. It makes me salivate just thinking about it. \nThe girls were served filet mignon & chicken medallions. The chicken was not dry, stuffed with sun dried tomatoes. The filet mignon (I am told) was medium rare, juicy, and tender. I had a plate of roasted veggies. They also served their bread rolls, which come covered in garlic butter in a pan. Yum! Alongside the entrees were small pots of sauteed mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were heavenly, slathered in a stick of butter, they were light and fluffy. The sauteed mushrooms were YUMYUMYUM, so tasty!\nOverall, we had an amazing time and this place is such a great place for a party! \n\nYummilicious Factor = B"

Great service and funny guy.... genuine.  \n\nTwo people not starving?  Belly up to George's bar and order a flat bread and maybe one other appetizer and you'll be stuffed.  Reasonably priced also.  My favorite appetizer that was off the new menu last week when I was there is the \"Lump Crab Appetizer\".  They can still get it to you though.\n\nThe problem with this place is groups of 6 or more and their steaks.  They charge an arm and a leg for them and spend a great deal of time selling you on the fact that it's the best you'll ever have.  They're good... but not THAT good.  Way overpriced.\n\nWhen busy, it's loud.  When it's cool outside, sit on patio if it's open.  No matter how much you like the food, you'll love the \"People Watching\" out there."

This was my first time eating here, so I had no expectations, only thing I knew about this place was the Beef Wellington they're known for. When we were seated the first thing I noticed was the wainscoting had old food particles all over it. Disgusting. It appeared no one has wiped down the area in years. I had to scoot away because I didn't want someone else's food from last year on my arm. \n\nFor dinner, I started out with the Wollensky Salad, this was soaked in salad dressing, there was a pile of it at the bottom of the dish, I love a good salad and this was nothing special. I tried the Deconstructed Beef Wellington, I ordered it medium well and it came out tartare, it was bright red in the middle, all the way through. I have a huge fear of returning food, so I tried my best to eat this but just could not get it down. It was smothered in foie gras & mushrooms. So overwhelming. Ended it with the coconut cake, I took 2 bites and was done. It tasted old like it had been made days before. This was by far the most disappointing Restaurant Week meal I had. I would never return."

When we arrived, we were told that there were no tables available and that the hostess just wanted us to come and wait. Fortunately, there were tables outside available after a few minutes wait.\n\nOur waiter, who didn't come to our table for 5 minutes or so, gave us our menus and walked away. When he came back again, he said, \"Did you guys already order drinks?\" We hadn't. Isn't it his job to ask for our drink orders? So we order drinks. He forgets two of them. It takes him another 10 minutes, roughly, to get back to our table and take our order. Basically, the entire night, our waiter paid us very little attention. \n\nOur food was mediocre. When you are paying $50 per entree with everything else a la carte, your food better be effing spectacular. It wasn't. I got the filet, oscar style, which was $51, plus two sides, which were another $25.  My steak was overdone to the degree that I couldn't chew some of it. The mashed potatoes were good, but a small portion for $12. The asparagus was also good, but again, it was $12 for a two person portion.\n\nThe reviews from the other six guys were very similar. The food was fine, but nothing special at those prices. For the seven of us, the bill came to $575. I wouldn't go back. It is WAY overpriced for the quality and service we got that night."

You take a well-known restaurant from somewhere else or a well-known chef, drop it/he/she in Vegas, don't get it 100% right, and end up with some bastardized version of the original.\n\nThree bottles of Pinot Noir for the table is always a good way to start, so that's what we did.  Appetizers were good, but nothing special.  Your usual mix of caesar salads, iceberg lettuce wedges with bleu cheese and a tomato bisque type soup.\n\nBiggest let down was their signature steak.  I had never been there so I asked the waiter what is the thing they are best known for and he said the \"Cajun Spice Rib Eye\".  The spice is rubbed in and then left to rest for 24 hours, blah, blah, blah.  I think they also told it that it had a nice personality so it would have high self-esteem.  They don't trim the steak so that the extra fat adds more flavor.  The problem was that every other bite had something that was undigestible because it was either fat or sinew.  I think I would have traded the \"flavor\" for just being edible.  Last thing about the steak - never tasted the cajun spice (insert Seinfeld voice - \"called a cajun steak...but wasn't cooked by a cajun and never tasted the spice...what is the deal with that?).  They must have known it was lacking flavor or something because they put their S&W steak sauce out on the table.  I'll be honest, I've never heard of a big-time steak house offering steak sauce.  I wanted to check if they had A-1 while he was at it.\n\nHighlight was actually dessert.  Coconut Layer Cake was awesome.  We also ordered the chocolate mousse, but they mistakenly brought out their \"Gigantic Chocolate Cake\" - no joke, that's what it's called on the menu.  This five layer monstrosity is the size of Fat Bastard's head and as tall as two phone books.  We passed it around the table and still had half of it left.  It was super moist, but it all stayed together when you cut it.  Phenomenal with a little coffee or espresso at the end.\n\nOverall, a pretty mediocre steak night (food-wise) with the fellas, but hey, you're in Vegas, so you let it slide."

Clearly more interested in maximizing revenue at the expense of customer service.  Food was so - so.  Some dishes really good, some no so much.   Avoid this place - mush better choices in the area."

First the good: great location on the strip, terrific service, decor and ambience. Just like a traditional East Coast steak house. Sides and wine were excellent: truffled mac and cheese, S&W green beans, sauteed spinach, fabulous bottle of rioja: all exemplary The problem was the steak. A big, bone in rib eye for $49 came charred on the outside, tough and overcooked. (I asked for Medium Rare), it was between Medium and Well done. Even if the temperature had been right, the charring outside was way overdone, and the quality of the cut was not great. Such a shame. But I will go go back and try another cut, perhaps the rack of lamb or filet mignon."

The waiter was terrible. Didn't take drink orders. Repeatedly had to go into the kitchen looking for the waiter. We were concerned about the service and the restaurant being staffed for a party of 15. Our fears came true. One waiter for 15 people is unacceptable. He would leave for one drink, bring it back then get the rest.  At one point he delivered one plate, someone asked for a special item, he left all the food on the cart and left for 10 minutes. \n\nPlease go somewhere else with better service."

The majority of the Steak houses in Vegas are open at 5:30 pm which wouldn't have worked for me but luckily Smith & Wollensky opens at 11am. \n\nMy husband and I started off with drinks to enjoy before the meal. I ordered a Skinny Mint . It tastes like Chocolate Mint candy but it was a little strong for me. The waiter was nice enough to ask me if I liked my drink because it looked like it hasn't been touched. He was willing to get me another one but I just explained that I did like it it's just that I am a sipper. My husband helped me finish it towards the end of the meal because I couldn't do it by myself. I was already feeling warm and making up my own phrases...I was a little tipsy. The drinks were $14.95 so my husband made sure we finished most of it. \n\nI had the Rib Eye Steak with Truffled Mac and Cheese. I really wanted their Lobster Mashed Potatoes but they stopped serving it because it's a seasonal item. I wasn't sure how I'd feel eating Mac and Cheese with my steak but it was melt in your mouth delicious! The steak was nice and juicy which I love because there is nothing worse then a dry, tough steak. We also had the Wollensky salad that had a type of Dijon dressing, real bacon and potato croutons. That was also really good. \n\nWe ended the meal with coffee, tea and my complimentary Birthday dessert . The presentation was cute and it consisted of a chocolate walnut brownie which is one of my favorites. Who am I kidding anything chocolate is my favorite!"

We started with a dozen oysters on the half shell and the pork belly. The oysters were amazingly fresh and the pork belly was cooked to perfection -- super juicy and not overdone, with a superb corn butter sauce. We then shared the prime rib (with bone), with a side of cajun shrimp and crab legs; mac and cheese, spinach, and the wollensky salad. Everything was delicious -- the prime rib was juicy, the crab legs had a delicious lemon butter sauce, and shrimp was not overcooked. Even the bread was amazing -- with a sprinkle of sea salt and some herbs -- and whipped butter. \n\nThe food, combined with the great service, made this one of the best meals I've had in years."

Lots of good steak places to try in Vegas...this is surely one of them.  Exceptional service from every staff member we encountered in this restaurant.  They made you feel welcome and well taken care of.\n\nStarted with the Wedge salad.  Have to say, one of the best wedge salads I have ever had anywhere.  Just enough to make you want more.  The blue cheese dressing is made in-house and the lardons (think big bacon chunks) are spectacular.\nThey are known for BONE IN steaks, so I usually get a filet, but bone in it was.  I did the Cajun Rib Eye 24 oz.  I do not need to eat again until Labor Day, but it was soooo good.  Cooked just right.  When you want to eat the fat, you know it's cooked right.  The Cajun spice was marinated into the meet for 24 hours, so really flavorful and if you like spice, this one's for you.  My partner had the Au Povoir style, in red wine reduction and LOTS OF PEPPER.  He didn't care for the way his medium steak came out, and didn't say anything until we left.  You pay a lot for these steaks, and they did ask several times how the steak was.  If mine was overcooked, I would have let them know.  He did not...so, guess I have to take off a star for his meal.  We shared the corn side dish - very fresh, they shave that corn right off the cob in a funky sauce that is a little spicy, but with my meal, it was a nice compliment.  Also shared a loaded baked potato and I couldn't eat all of that as the steak took precedence for me.\n\nHad a nice Russian River Pinot with dinner that was recommended and an excellent choice if you are a fan of this type of wine.\n\nWould consider it again, after I make my way through all the other steakhouse in town.

For some reason S&W has the perfect balance of creamy richness and gooey cheesy texture, yet is feels light enough to eat the entire serving - or at least get sick trying.  Most places it's too runny or too thick, too rich or not tasty enough.  S&W just gets it right, every single time.\n\nI have been coming here for years and I recommend this place to anyone wanting a great steak (yes, they do serve steak with the creamed spinach on occasion).  I honestly never order anything besides the bone-in rib eye.  Why?  Because it's that damn good people.  In all my experiences, I have never had a bad steak.  Never.  It always comes out a perfect medium rare with a nice tasty char on the outside.\n\nOn my most recent visit, I noticed the changed the bread basket and no longer had the mustard butter.  I was pretty saddened and almost had to walk out of there.  Yeah, right, who am I kidding?  Seriously, though, the new stuff just isn't as good as before, but it is still ok.  \n\nFor appetizers, I recommend you don't eat any.  The first time I did, many years ago, I paid the price and couldn't finish my steak.  In case you were wondering, I had ordered the caprese, which was, in and of itself, pretty darn big.  Now when I go, I just skip the apps and head straight for the beef and sides.\n\nFor sides, my staples are: creamed spinach (duh!), sauteed mushrooms and mac & cheese.  Honestly, all the sides are pretty standard fare, but to me, the creamed spinach is outstanding.\n\nWorth mentioning is that S&W does not charge a corkage for bottles of wine you bring in, as long as it's not on the list and your group is 4 or less.  No corkage!  If you live in Vegas, like I do, that is like money in your pocket.  Most places charge $35, so if you bring two bottles (the limit here), you just saved $70 on corkage!  That's a meal here!  Go ahead and order an extra desert (if you're not totally stuffed).\n\nUm, speaking of deserts, I can't really say much.  I have never had a single desert here through my numerous visits.  I'm always stuffed to gills from eating the fantastic meat.\n\nIf you want A5 Kobe or some jazzed-up, marinated or sauced beef, this is the wrong place.  You come here for a damn fine slab of prime, dry-aged American cow cooked to absolute perfection.\n\nIf you want a quiet, romantic or posh eatery, where you can people watch this ain't it.  The decor is stark and simple, the service spot on and the repeat clientele come for the beef, not the meat.  Well, I come for the spinach, but hey, we all have our own quirks, right?"

            "review": "We were staying at the MGM and wondered what would be a good place to hold us over until dinner buffet. Well, considering it was 105 degree heat outside, we didn't want to venture too far from our hotel. We ended up stumbling into Smith and Wollensky. We were going to try a different steak house but it was snugged away in a suspicious looking alley way.\n\nAnyhow, upon arriving we were seated. There weren't too many other people in the restaurant and we started to think this wasn't the best choice of restaurant. We got our water from a waiter, and then was left to flag someone down when we were ready to order. No one came by to check up on us (and for the rest of the lunch for that matter). One of the reasons is that all the servers are guys, and a baseball game was on. I understand that sports draws your attention, but if you have hungry people at a table anxiously waiting to order, take a break!\n\nWe didn't touch any of the seafood items because we would be heading to a seafood buffet that night. We ordered a bone-in ribeye steak, and a sirloin. To accompany the meal, we picked out the truffle macaroni and cheese.\n\n20 minutes later, we receive our meal (which was preceded by a bread bowl which was hardly that... think of Wetzel's Pretzels). Thankfully, our food came out pretty decent. The meats were both tender, and cooked almost perfectly. Mine was a bit on the charred side. The true star was the mac and cheese. With the savory flavor of the truffle oil, it was the stand out... that doesn't sit well for a place that claims they are a good steakhouse.\n\nAll in all, the service is lackluster and while the food tasted good, it really doesn't match up for the pricing this place is asking for. Considering we came all this way for some good steak, it just doesn't seem all that worth it."

Since we were staying at the MGM this was right next door. We were able to walk in on a Friday during CES. Our steaks were great, and cooked perfectly. Other reviews state that this wasn't the case, maybe we had a better evening because the restaurant was not very full when we dined. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were also well executed. \nIf you are in the mood for a steak, and are staying at the MGM and don't want to pay for CRAFTsteak, this is a good alternative."

The atmosphere is awesome, service is homey, & the food is prepared simply and delicious. Don't expect modern skimpy food, expect generous tried & true food. I used to think this was an expensive restaurant, but now I believe that prices have caught up to S&W instead of vise versa. \nThis last visit I learned 2 thing new about steak at S&W...always order the fillet, and never order the rib eye (lol). \nThis visit the wine week wine selection was amazing, the highlight was the Jordan Cab. Sav.\nThe food ordered was:\nApps:\nScallops-delicious-3 huge pieces w/fresh & tasty produce. Good peanut sauce. 4.5/5\nFlat bread w/shrimp and avocado-pretty solid app. It had a welcome amount of spice and beautiful tomatoes & avocados. 3.5/5 \nMain course:\nFillet Au Poivre-perfectly cooked, well made sauce, good texture. 5/5\nCajun marinated rib eye- it came bone-in (a plus), and was cooked as ordered, med rare. However, this had way too much fat + grizzle. I know the cut of meat I ordered is supposed to have fat, but this was way too much fat. The Cajun marinade was too peppery and over powering what little meat was on the bone. 2/5\nSides:\nMashed potatoes-good, solid. 4/5\nAsparagus- big, fresh, & tasty. Served w/a nice sauce to boot. I cant help but feel that I am eating health as an added bonus. 5/5\nDessert:\nCoconut cake: this is one of my wife's favorite desserts anywhere. It is simply put...Amazing! Moist, fresh, not too sweet,  served w/ berries & fresh coconut, and generously served. \nThe service is 4/5. \nI am not going to do the math...this is a solid 4 star restaurant. Next time when I order the fillet it will be 4.5/5 (let's hope).  I dont believe this restaurant is trying to be anything more than a good stand by type of place.\nMore on the rib eye/fillet deal:\nThe best fillets I have had came from S&W. The previous time I visited S&W, back in October 2010, I ordered a bone-in rib eye and did not care for it. This time I ordered a Cajun rib eye and it came bone-in and did not care for it. One of my favorite steak memories hands down: bone-in Cajun seasoned rib eye from n9ne. I don't care for that place, but the steak on it's own was the absolute best piece of meat I ever had-nothing else about that place was mentionable. \nMore about the service:\nYou get one server, that's it. He/she takes your order, fills your beverage, & serves your food. In my experience the servers have always been cordial, I have seen other servers being more friendly towards other patrons, but have never received poor service."

I'm kind of glad because if I saw what we see on the shows I would not have enjoyed my meal.  \n\nI ordered the signature bone in NY cut sirloin, medium rare--it was perfectly medium rare and perfectly seasoned.  I wish that I could have finished it, but I just couldn't--the portions were huge!  I can't remember what my husband ordered, but it was a giant rib that hung way off the plate!  It obviously was delicious because he pretty much finished it.  Even if you are not a steak eater, you will find something on the menu that will satisfy you.  My daughter said that her salmon was fit for a 5 star seafood restaurant. \n\nOur waiter was very helpful in making suggestions.  He was also good at reading people because when he asked if we wanted more bread, there was a bit of silence, so he just put some on the table, taking our split second of hesitation as a \"yes\".  \n\nThis is one of the few places where I will eat the steak tartare--loved it.  We also got the usual sides--mushrooms, asparagus, baked potatoes--passed on the truffle mac and cheese this time which is amazing, too.  The one thing that I am sad about is that they've removed the pork shank from the menu.  My mother-in-law said they brought it back as a special once, so I was praying and praying that it would be on the menu as a special again . . . no such luck.  I'm figuring that maybe they might consider adding it back to the menu if enough people \"yelp\" to reminisce about the time they were able to order this.

We specifically wanted someplace we had never been to before that we could walk to, so we wanted to try this legendary steakhouse chain.\n\nThis is a decent, reliable place to get a steak, but I wouldn't rate it in the top steakhouses I have been to in Las Vegas.

The prices were not outrageous, as I don't remember what we paid.  If it was too expensive, I would have remembered.  My biggest complaint was that the fillet was bland and it tasted as if there was no seasoning whatsoever.  My husband had the bone-in fillet which was more flavorful, but he said it did not hold a candle to his favorite fillet from Vic and Anthony's in the Golden Nugget.\n\nNormally I would give a place like this three stars, because it was okay.  But I had seen that the coconut cake that is served here was highlighted in a food network show and other food shows.  I don't normally partake in dessert at all, ever, but I had to try it.  It was \"holy shit,\" good, and is probably the best dessert I have ever tasted.  Here's a picture of it from a famous food blog that I frequently read:\n\nhttp://newyork.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sugar-rush-smith-wollenskys-coconut-cake-dessert-nyc.html\n\nThis is like coconut heaven, if there is such a place.  I could have eaten a troth of this cake, but they would take me away in a coma.  My husband, who does not like coconut, even tried it and said it was pretty damn good (he'll never admit he loved it though).\n\nI would come here again just to eat coconut cake.  Thank god it is on the strip in an area that is a pain in the ass to get to, or I might do that too much."

The $61 bone-in ribeye was not very good. Creamed spinach was cold. The restaurant was about half full on NYE and the only reservation we could get at the last minute.  I think their stand alone location on the wrong side of the strip is hurting them. The other contemporary / newer steakhouses in this town have passed smith & wollensky by, quite literally. This restaurant felt like an old dated taxi cab to Carnavino's uber. I predict this location will close during 2017. Suggest you spend your money elsewhere."

Smith and Wollensky is a steak/lobster restaurant on the strip across from Monte Carlo.\n\nAmbiance/Decor: Americana. Could be used as a venue for Gangster Movies in the 30's. Rustic Wood Tables.  Real clothtowels in the bathroom instead of papertowels. \n\nSocial Scene: Loud and rowdy group of friends at one table dressed to the nines. Two couples (including me and boyfriend) trying to have a quiet dinner in Vegas.\n\nService:  Excellent! \n\nWhat we ordered:\nSalud!:  A glass of Smith and Wollensky Napa Reserve $18\n               Iced Tea    $ 4.75\nFood:  2 Whole Lobsters and 10 oz Steak for me and BF $59 each\n            4 pcs Oysters on Half-Shell $16\n\nTotal: $193.90 including tax and tip\n\nOverall:\n1.  Being with my Asian family who loves buffets, BF and I wanted to have a nice quiet dinner by ourselves that will not include stuffing ourselves with 40 dishes.  So, we sneaked out!\n\n2.  Believe it or not, the restaurants on the strip were closed at 11PM except the bars and clubs. Smith and Wollensky was the only place that was open  until midnight.  That's how we ended here by accident.\n\n3.  The dinner was disappointing considering how expensive it was.  The steak was burnt (no,not charbroiled) dry and bland that BF and I ended up dipping the steak in the sauce that came for the lobster.    The small lobster came with a rich sauce and hot melted butter on the side. It was rubbery. BF said maybe because we were the last customers for the evening. Not good enough excuse for a $200 dinner!\n\n4.  If you are in Vegas, skip this place. There are so many fine dining available out there!\n\nI'll keep this review short and sweet since WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS STAYS IN VEGAS.   One thing's for sure though, Boyfriend and I had a memorable and  romantic weekend in Las Vegas! ;)"

It is wonderfully creamy and is topped off with the right amount of bread crumbs which makes it nice and crispy on top. And of course the wonderful truffle oil that they use to make it irresistible.\n\nAnd of course their steaks are just AMAZING! The Portherhouse for Two (which is on their dinner menu but also available for lunch if you ask nicely), is enough food for two guys or three girls. It also comes with yummy vegetables that were sauteed in the drippings from the steak. All of their steaks are dry aged which provides a beautiful meaty flavor and because they know how to sear the steaks well each bite is a beautiful little treasure of meaty goodness.\n\nThe Cajun Rib Eye was also really nicely done. The seasoning provides a gentle kick and and was nicely seared on the outside, providing you with that savory crust that good steaks have.\n\nIf you have a hard time finding this place, it is directly across the street from the Monte Carlo."

I split the USDA rib eye and the veal rib eye with one of our directors. Sides are all a la carte so you can share with your table. I wasn't super impressed with the sides, I felt they lacked some seasoning/flavor. The rib eye was on point though, cooked to a juicy perfection. I have been to other upscale steakhouses that are in the same price range and was more impressed with them, which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. Had I been the one to foot the bill for this I probably would not have been so happy.. But again, great service, great atmosphere. It is right on the heart of the strip, so for a local that kind of sucks. This may be why they weren't as busy as I would have expected.. Us locals avoid the strip like the plague. For that reason combined with having a better dining experience elsewhere, I probably won't be back here.. but that's not to say it isn't worth trying!"

I love this place now, friendly staff greeted at the door. After being seated, warm bread is served in a pan. So cute! \n\nThe beau and I wasn't all that hungry, so we decided to get 1 appetizer and main course to share. Always a good idea to share when you are not all that hungry. We don't want any good steak to go to waste. \n\nFor appetizer we had Truffles Mac and Cheese, OMG! It was delicious! Thank you fellow Yelper for the awesome suggestion! None of it went to waste, every little bit of it was taken care of by my tummy.\n\nAs for the main course, we shared Wollensky Steak. Very YUM! It came with 6 pieces of thickly sliced steak with a little sauce on the side. Crab (big pieces of crab meat) salad served on a sea shell. And some steam veggies lined up in the center. Very yum! And just enough for 2 people who are not so hungry to share.\n\nCustomer service was a plus, very nice and knowledgeable staff. Had a lot of suggestions for us, since it was our first time there. \n\nFor those who ate steak during the meal, they actually bring out a different type of knife for you to use. It was nice and shiny, and for sure very sharp. I need one of those at home. Ha ha. \n\nI will most definitely go back and dine there again. Hopefully soon. :)"

We walked by the sign for $9 lunch burger special 2x while walking the week on the strip, and on the last day (8/6) after feeling severely hung over decided a burger was what we needed.   I have got to tell you this is one of the best deals around, it was unbelievable. We walked off the 105 degree strip into the lush air-conditioned restaurant and sat at the bar. $4 draft fosters were as good as you can get if your not at a casino bar. The burger was huge with bacon and cheese of your choice. It was so juicy I got a drip on my lap so lean over when you bite. The super nice bartender girl told us the meat is entirely ground from steak so no wonder it tasted this good.  The $9 lunch burger special is only during the slower non convention busy season (hello isn't summer busy enough?) so snap this up!  (side note, this awesome lunch of burgers for two and a few like 5 beers was cheaper than the crappy breakfast we had at the PBR cafe the day before, better ways to spend $60 in Vegas)"

The manager, William Wilson, was very friendly and warm and attended to our whole dining experience. I recommend this place to all my friends. Very happy and satisfied customer here. :)"

But seriously this is a great steakhouse. First of all it's restaurant week in Vegas my favorite two weeks in the year.  So for 40 bucks I got their split pea soup, a filet Oscar that's actually 10 bucks more and their famous coconut cake.  Let's start with the split pea soup. First of all I hate peas. So you would think that's an odd choice for a starter. But they're famous for it and I had to try it. Our waiter said it tasted more like pork to him then peas and he was right. They bring it in a silver container and they pour it into a bowl while at the same time pour fresh croutons on top of the soup.  It was great. Then the filet Oscar obviously comes with crab on top with hollandaise sauce and asparagus it was fantastic.  We ordered some sides and they were the truffle mac & cheese and the onion rings. When they say sides for two they mean sides for 2 to 4. Seriously these sides were humongous really nothing like the modern-day steakhouses which don't tend to give you as much.  This is like old school when it says since 1977 I'm willing to bet not a lot has changed but this is actually a good thing. The dishes are Kinda retro the portions are kinda retro and the food is kind of retro but it's all really comforting and good.   I was also additionally lucky that for four days they were doing a wine flight for 20 bucks that benefited the Cleveland clinic. Three fantastic wines for 20 bucks a French Rose a California Pinot Noir and a California cab.  Really one of the best deals in town but otherwise their wine list is pricey.   The coconut cake really is the star.  First the waiter tells us that it was on the best thing I ever ate on food network. It is really that good. Creamy and delicious. The service is impeccable we never wanted for anything.  I will definitely go back."

The first time we had a bachelor party 7 guys dressed in suits. We wanted to start our Vegas trip off right. We each had a fillet minion and 1 guy got the prime rib. We also included 2 bottles of wine. The selection was good according to our wine guy, We got Asparagus spears, mashed potatoes, and truffle encrusted macaroni and cheese. The mac was the best I've every had. Mashed potatoes were mediocre at best. The Asparagus was cooked perfectly. The steaks were cooked perfectly. The peppercorn sauce or simply grilled are the way to go. I enjoyed the Cajun style mixed with the peppercorn sauce but I'm not a minimalist when it comes to steaks, I like saucing it up a little.\n\nThe second time I came I got the prime rib bail out special. For $49 bucks you get an app, main course and a dessert. What a spectacular deal. The prime rib was perfect. The warm salad was terrific as a start and the dessert was incredible. As a word of warning the desserts are a little large and you may need help finishing it off.\n\nI recommend this place. So far it is my Gold standard of steak places. It is also a must stop when you're in Vegas, to get away from the neon crap at least for a little while."

It did feel a little crammed in there (with the walls closing in on you).  But I got the feeling that was intended to create a more cozy, familiar atmosphere.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I thought my steak (beef filet) was actually decent.  It was cooked properly at medium rare.  The only problem was that it was a little on the salty side.  The a la carte sides were nothing special.  I did have a crab cake to start and that was mediocre.\n\nFor dessert, they talked up the pecan pie.  I ordered that, and it was nothing special though the large man next to me who took some bites from it seemed like he was in love.\n\nThis is the only Smith & Wollensky I've been to so I couldn't tell you if it was any better or worse.  However, my experience with most Las Vegas restaurants is that they are (a) below average and (b) overpriced."

But enough about me being treated to a nice meal, lets talk about the meal.\n\nSmith and Wollensky has a menu equal parts, steak, seafood and whiskey, which is my kind of place. My filet Oscar was topped with the perfect amount of crab  and was also cooked to perfection. It was hard to finish it because we started with a seafood sampler that had great lobster claws, crab cakes and jumbo shrimp. Easily one of the best meals I've ever eaten.\n\nThe waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. They talked to us a bit about our reasons for being in town and it was beyond your normal patron and waiter banter.\n\nAnother nice feature was this restaurant has a kitchen room where we were enclosed by glass. We could see the kitchen which was very cool. (It was clean by the way).\n\nBest bet: get the crab cakes in some way, shape or form. Also try the tremendous sides that are great for sharing. The macaroni and cheese was among the best I've ever eaten and the baked potatoes were the size of footballs. No exaggeration."

The truffle mac and cheese is so yummy and rich, but I can only have a little because of that. The asparagus and creamed spinach are my favs...oh and my daughter loves their chocoloate cake! They have a good wine selection as well, which my Mom really enjoyed ('96 Ch Montrose)! LOL \n\nThis is where I go when I want a steak and I'll deal with the strip traffic to get it.

This is Vegas peoples and the restaurant is on the strip, so if you want a quiet romantic dinner spot, then I think room service is the best bet. Note that this steak restaurant is not in California, so if you are a Californian steak lover, Vegas is the closest S&W.\n\nI came here with a bachelor party and once inside, we were placed in a table near the restaurant entrance.  The table would have been fitting except for the fact that I was rubbing elbows with the couple next to us (I was on the end part of the table). So for where we were, the table space was itty bitty too tight!\n\nIf youre a meat eater, then definitely get the Cajun Marinated Bone-In Rib Eye.  The slab is a pretty hearty size and is their signature steak.  I tried my friends regular Bone-In Rib Eye and it was decent but tasted a bit dry. I would say that the steak is comparable to the ruth chris and mortons of the world. That said, the food item that REALLY caught my eye was the mac and cheese w/ truffle oil. You food lovers know what im talking about - truffle oil makes anything brilliant. The mac and cheese was excellent and was the first dish that was licked clean by our group. On top of this, we ordered the asparagus and fries. Both were nothing special as the asparagus was just lightly salted and the fries were delivered hot and soggy. \n\nOur server was a big jolly wrestling looking fellow who had a hilarious persona.  The service was legit as we were never without a full glass of water, wine or a drink.  Most impressively, we all (group of 10) received our steaks at the same time, which is a must in my book!\n\nAll in all, this restaurant is good variety amongst those Vegas buffets!"

Makes me appreciate the good places for steak.  I had a good run by basing my choice of locations on Yelp and The Food Network.  Lobster was tasty though and the Mac and cheese was delicious!!  no joke!"

            "review": "03/11/13-03/15/13 LUNCH\n\nDURING WINE WEEK.\n\nNOTE: THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN UPDATED WITH THE LAST 3 DAYS OF DINING.\n\nThe DOs and DON'Ts of lunches @ Smith & Wollensky.\n\nDO's\n- Lobster bisque. Lovely sherry flavor, lots of bits of lobster, very nice.\n- Mussels. Wonderful.\n- Wedge salad. Classic.\n- Wollensky salad. This was a surprise. Quite good, altho lettuce could be a better choice. The bacon lardons and potato \"croutons\" were nice.\n- Foie gras burger.\n- Lobster BLT, altho not the best priced item to order ($25).\n- Steak sandwich. Split this and the Lobster BLT with spouse, we both thought this sandwich was a better deal than the Lobster.\n- Swordfish in cracked pepper crust w/ veal jus. This was interesting. The fish is a little overwhelmed by the massive amounts of pepper used in this dish, however, unbelievably a bit of this with the Chardonnay they served that day during Wine Week (one of the few that wasn't simply an oak bomb) was heavenly.\n- Salmon w/ risotto & smoked tomato sauce. This worked wonderfully. My fave main dish of the week.\n- Deconstructed Beef Wellington, ONLY offered on the Restaurant Week lunch menu. Even tho it came looking rather unattractive (lots of brown!), and it had the foie gras and mushroom duxelles in separate \"patties\", it tasted great. BUT MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY TEMPERATURE, THEY WON'T ASK! Luckily it was medium rare, I prefer rare, but medium rare is fine for me, too.\n- Truffle mac & cheese. Perhaps the best side item on the entire menu. NOW, REGARDING THE CONTROVERSY RE: TRUFFLE OIL. Yes, I know, truffle oil is not truffles, it's chemically induced. BUT added to a cheese item such as this, and a price point easily accessible by the \"rest of us\" (ie dwindling middle class), I'm not going to complain. It went beautifully with the Pinot Noirs during wine week, I'm happy. And who can afford true black and especially white truffles these days? So if you're monied enough to complain about lack of real truffles, eat elsewhere.\n- Haricot verts w/ spiced cashews & mild gorgonzola cheese. After a week of hearty, rich dishes, this was a breath of fresh air. Lightest dish in the sides, I'd order this again. So refreshing.\n- Chocolate cake. Last time I had this, 6+ months ago, I wasn't as impressed. This time, it was really good, but you MUST share, it's the size of a small boat.\n- Coconut cake.\n- Carrot cake.\n\nDON'Ts\n- Club soda. $4 for a tiny bottle brought to the table. Not even poured for you!\n- Buffalo mozzerela & tomato salad. This was good, but I've made better myself with ingredients at the Downtown Las Vegas Farmers' Market.\n- Split pea soup. Thin, weak, sad.\n- Dry aged prime t-bone steak. I hate to put this on the DON'Ts, but I must. I ordered it rare, it didn't have much flavor, and was rather tough. I'm glad I didn't pay full price ($40+), I got it for a deal (basically $20 during the Restaurant Week, a one-day-only offer). Perhaps they were trying to get rid of them?\n- DON'T order ANY dish that has lovely, large looks-like-diver scallops. The kitchen will always send them out so overcooked it will break your heart. Even that \"scallop & sliced prime beef\" dish you see at the top right of the menu. It had an interesting blue cheese fondue, and some of that beef, scallop & sauce combined worked well (strange as that might sound), but the 8 or more large scallops had the consistency of rocks. Very sad.\n\nPS Service can be spotty. First day this week, rather blase'. Rest of the week, good to great service."

You have to make a turn in a really narrow alley to get to the parking lot.  They do offer valet.  The ambiance was pretty nice, but nothing WOW about it.  We were at a private room which I thought was large enough to accommodate our party. The views from the private room were okay.  The staff members were really nice and friendly. I researched the place before I went and the photos taken on their website looks way better than in person.  They are located between Ross and Walgreens on Las Vegas Blvd.  Overall, customer service was great, food was delicious and our party was amazing so I give this restaurant a 4-star review"

The decor was very old-school and the servers were friendly and informative.  The portions were a little pricey, but hey its a steak house and well my steak was larger than my head so I'm not complaining.  \n\nIts also worth noting that the wine selection is quite good and if you have a chance definitely try the trillian lobster which everyone in my party seemingly enjoyed... note I say seemingly enjoyed because while they ordered this awesome lobster i somehow made the mistake of ordering the afore mentioned larger than my head prime rib (which was quite tasty... and did i mention large??)."

But on this occasion it was Thanksgiving Dinner date. Smith & Wollensky did not disappoint. 5 stars (or circles) again\n\nThey had a nice little Prix Fixe spread for $50 per person. Worth every penny! Soup & salad, deliciously juicy turkey slices (both white & dark meat) with all the fixings (carrots, potatoes, stuffing, etc...) and choice of desert. Far too much food for me & my girlfriend to finish, though we really did try. \n\nThe service was top notch. You would think on Thanksgiving that people who had to work would have a bit of a chip on their shoulder, but no. Everyone had a smile on their face & was more than accommodating. I think about 3 or 4 different people came to check in to see if we were doing all right. And respectfully in between courses so I didn't have to answer with a full mouth for once.\n\nIn the past, the steak here has been tender & juicy. This time around the turkey was more of the same. At $50 per person, if they have a holiday prix fixe menu, I would undoubtedly recommend it. For just their regular dinner menu, on the whole it leans slightly towards the pricey side. But the bottom line is you're getting a great meal.\n\nVisited November 2012"

The service was past top notch.  I saw one reviewer saying that S&W is not as good as Flemings or Ruth Chris...I wouldn't even put them in the same category.  First off I am a rib eye man and Ruth Chris is a Filet place IMHO.  So I stayed true to my liking and did the Cajun ribeye. Flemings is just mediocre from my times there.  Back to the Ribeye, this steak just simply melted in your mouth. Yes there was a lot of fat, but that is to be expected on a Prime Aged ribeye. I carefully cut around all of it while the guy who was sitting next to me (this was a coporate party of 12 people) eat every last drop of that fat.  If you don't like that type of cut the some nice NY strips and nice Filet's as well.\n\nOverall the creamed spinach is top notch, I had not ever had the mac and cheese with lobster, it was great and the asparagus were very good.\n\nI would take this over Morton's, Flemings, RC, or just about any other chain. To do better you need to go with the one-off steak house, Peter Luger's comes to mind. There are just not many better.\n\nDid I mention the CAJUN Ribeye? If you like some spice, this is a no brainer. If your not afraid to look like a gluton order the tomahawk one, of course it would help if you do not have to pay the bill as that is a spendy cut."

            "review": "My first impression of S&W was love at first sight.  A steak house that does not pretend to be anything other than a steak house.  I was with a large group of co wokers 11 total.  Smith allocated one full time waiter and one that helped plus a bus boy.  \n\nThe first clue of what I was in for is when the seafood appitizers came out.  Two huge platters of shrimp, lobster, oysters, crab.  The food was fantastic and was perfection personified.  At this point I knew I would not be able to eat my salad.  I asked the waiter if it was possible to cancel the salad.  He did with no problems.  Mrs K. ordered and kept her salad.  She had a wedge salad.  It was typical ingredients of a wedge blue cheese bacon and other stuff.  What makes this notable was the bacon.  True huge chunks of bacon a size I have never seen before.  While Mrs. K was gone from the table I tasted the bacon.  wow!  \n\nFor the meal I ordered no sides but others around me did.  All sides are enough for 2 people easy.  What caught my eye was the Truffe Mac and Cheese.  Looked great but alas no taste for me. My steak was something I normally do not get which is a fillet.  It just seemed to be the right size for the meal we were having and it had a topping of gargonzola cheese.  Each bite was just a slice of heaven.  Cooked per my request and served while still hot.  Good Job!!\n\nWhile I did not have any dessert I did see their version of a slice of chocolate cake.  Slice is not a proper term.  It was more like 1/4 of a cake.  All people who had the desert loved it.  funny how everyone says they are so full and cannot eat another bite but all the dessert was gone."

I can't bring myself to leave less than 3 stars because my 2/3 dinners at S&W have been nothing short of spectacular.\nWe had a dinner party of 7 in over Easter weekend and I just have to say that I've learned my lesson - Bone in filet is just not the cut for me.\nWay too much sinew around the bone - I like my steak to be mouth melty, vs. getting that bubble gum crackle of gristle between the teeth.  I do wish I had more of an opportunity to give feedback at the table especially after leaving a third of the cut on my plate, but admittedly my party members were too busy enthusing to the waiter so it would have been hard to sneak that in. Since we hosted the dinner, I'm very happy that the rest of my party had a great S&W experience and I will chalk up my decision as the wrong one for me, can't win them all, can't ever go home again kind of happenstance. I tasted my friend's filet Oscar and it was delicious and melty.  \nThe seafood appetizer was awesome, and the sides were great as always."

Ok I am exaggerating on all fronts here but the bottom line is Smith and Wollensky is what we thought they were--an outstanding steakhouse. If you read there tagline, \"It's a place to end all arguments\" and after one visit, you will quickly learn why! Matter a fact if she can't get over the fact you were texting a random on behalf of your friend who lost his cell phone *wink wink* then run my friend, run. Because if she can't forgive you after wolving down a $50 steak, your SOL and she can go eat at the Olive Garden with the next chump she meets! Good riddance sista..ok back to the food. \n\nI'm a creature of habit so I order pretty much the same thing every time..if it aint broke, don't fix it right? First off you have to wet the palate! Beefeater straight up with Olives Sir (throw a little bass in your voice too). \n\nNext up, the Wedge salad! Um..excuse me waiter, can you tell the chef don't be tight with the Blue Cheese! He will usually laugh and wa-la you got extra complimentary Blue Cheese! Fuckin A!!  \n\nNext Order the cajun ribeye if you like a little kick to your steak and you won't be disappointed. And don't be that guy that orders it Well Done, act like you've been there before and calmly say, medium rare thanks...I'll usually go with this cut and it takes up the entire plate. Also at this time I will order a glass of Pinot or Cab and tell them you want it delivered simultaneously with the steak!\n\nAs for sides there Mac and Cheese is without question the best Mac and Cheese on the planet. Other sides that are worth trying, the sauteed mushrooms, grilled asparagus and of course the twiced baked potatoe. Also there seafood tower is legit although I don't reccommend it if your palate is set on beef because it's overkill with all the food and you might of walked in looking like Vin Diesel, but after indulging you might leave looking like Tony Soprano, so be forewarned. (This happened to me once, was on a date and somehow the fuckin shirt shrunk during dinner and when I left, I couldn't breathe! dohhh)\n\nAs for cocktails, the mixologists here do a great job here on whipping up that concoction that you enjoy. Extensive wine list and a great selection of wines by the glass. On the side bar, I believe they still sell cigars although I am not sure where you can fire up at. There scotch selection is great and I reccommend going with an 18 year Glenlivet single malt to wash down that great meal. \n\nLook let's face it, you're in Vegas, your going to drop $200 easy gambling, at the club or at the strippy...SO do yourself a favor and call your concierge at your hotel and tell that cocksucker you need a reservation at Smith and Wolls baby! Never. Stop. Eating."

When I received my steak, I realized why...it was COLD and had been precooked, then kept in a refrigerator.  And this is from a STEAKHOUSE!!!  At the very least, the menu (or waiter) should have warned that it was a cold steak salad (allowing one to make an informed decision).  None of my friends finished their salads, either...they just weren't that tasty.   I don't expect ever to be back...even if someone else is paying.  The only thing worth eating was the crab cake.\n\nI really am appalled at the fact that a steakhouse would serve cold, refrigerated steak, even if it's on the salad.

Now on to the real review.\n\nS&W's steaks are brilliant. The aging process they use imparts a medium earthiness and creates a bite through the meat that is perfect. Not tough but actually requires you to chew lightly to savor the flavor. I recommend the bleu cheese encrusted filet and the porterhouse.\n\nThe bar is VERY EXTENSIVE to which I was extremely grateful. I am an avid absinteur and enjoyed that they had four different types of absinthe/pastis NOT SERVED ELSEWHERE in Las Vegas. I recommend ordering a Ricard with a rocks glass of ice water.\n\nAlso the sides are awesome, the truffled mac and cheese is great but I preferred it without the truffle oil,  baked potatoes are huge, and the sauteed mushrooms were served in a butter wine reduction that was superb.\n\nLastly, we had 3 different desserts: creme brulee, fresh fruit marinated in liqueur, and a chocolate souffle. All were excellent.\n\nThe service and hours are wonderful. Open til 1-2am and the servers pointed us in the right direction when it came to food. The prices were sizable (4 people, $355+$80 tip) but VEEEEERY worth it.\n\nWhen you need to have a night just to splurge and experience excellence in a steakhouse, visit Smith and Wollensky's."

No matter where we go in Vegas, I usually order steak, and this steak is hands-down my favorite. It is expensive, so know that going in and you'll have a fabulous time! I always eat waaaaayyyy too much and need a nap afterward!\n\nNote: They are known for their Cajun rub, but we did not enjoy that flavor at all. Stick with just a plain ol' steak... no need to get fancy :)\n\nLet me reiterate: Don't pass up the bread!"

I try to make at least one dinner here whenever I am in Vegas on business or vacation, and it never disappoints.\n\nSure, there are many upscale and trendy steakhouses and celebrity restaurants all throughout the Vegas strip now, but on occasion I stll like the old school feel of having a meal at S&W.\n\nDuring my last visit here a few months back I had a filet mignon perfectly cooked medium rare. Delicious cut of meat with a nice char on the edges. Huge amount of steamed broccoli, yummy mac and cheese, and soft baked potato the size of a Nerf football. Paired with a nice Malbec this was just a terrific meal. I usually order almost this same meal each time I am there, and never get tired of it.\n\nService has always been top notch and know their stuff.

            "review": "Another multinational chain and another one supposing itself to be high end, though they didn't seem to really bother with this place. It feels more like a fish house than a steak house, actually. Lots of white trim, but also lots of white paint...maybe even more like a boat than a restaurant. It also is in a peculiar location on the Strip, with the door in a little alleyway off to the side, perhaps that and the nondescript exterior paint to keep the Vegas wildlife on the Strip more at bay.  Before I get much further into this, seriously nothing will expose the conceit of pretension as far as high end as handing someone a paper menu and a stained one at that, which is what I got here. For the menu prices, they can definitely afford better...and a lot more sanitary.\n\nTo the meal, the majority of sides could have used work. Steak Tartare was a disaster. Beef bacon was also a near total miss. Rib Eye Carpaccio was the best of the lot but also required more work than an appetizer should. The potatoes, both varieties that were there and the mac and cheese as well, were offensively bad. Dessert was acceptable, but a chocolate layer cake is hardly challenging, though the cake itself was slightly dry.\n\nAs to the steak, they had a t-bone and given the choice, I have a hard time passing up either that or porterhouse. This one was probably closer to the latter rather than the former, but fine by me. The cut was solid, the cook was near flawless. Flavoring was not something I would put near the top of what I've had, but no real complaints, either. Service was also exemplary, easily among the best I've experienced in Vegas and were the other food items and the paper menu itself less disgusting, they probably would have earned the bump all by themselves."

There are much better high-end steak houses in Vegas,  went with a large party and the food was just average at five star prices.  Three people in our party steaks where undercooked and they argued with us like we wanted something for free.  This chain has struggled for years and it is not hard to see why;  the steak should be of prime quality and you should know how to cook at the proper temps.   My guess is they think the it is the economy is making for tough times for this chain and not that they don't know how to run a good steak house.  Got a tip for upper management, go to Gibson's in Chicago and eat there and get your pointers from them and you will see what sets them apart from your chain.  Gibson's has lines out the door and people waiting to eat at a huge restaurant.  It seems as though your company is following Texas Road House but charging five star prices.  We had a group of 10 and the price was over $2,000 which we are happy to pay...we only want the experience that should go along with that price tag!\n\nUpdate on how they treat people 1/26/13:\nAn Italian tourist forgot his wallet and landed in jail. Ok, he actually forgot his wallet after ordering $208 worth of food at high-end New York steakhouse, Smith & Wollensky. When he realized his mistake, Graziano Graziussi offered to leave his iPhone as collateral. Then he asked a busboy to accompany him to his hotel to get the money. However, the Steakhouse still called the cops. Probably, yelling something like \"...if you wanted compromise you should have eaten at Applebees!\"\nThis article is real and posted to support that this company really needs better leadership as they think the customer is the enemy that is somehow trying to get something for free!\n\nThey should be out of business in no time!"

            "review": "I've always driven by this place when passing through the Strip. Had to finally check it out for myself. Had dinner here for mama's birthday. We had heard about some Summer Grill promotion they were doing. Discounted prices for their traditional menu. Definately a factor in helping us on our decision. \n\nWe made reservations for 9pm. It was quiet in there on a Monday nite. We liked the decor of the place. Very homey with hardwood floors and a classic steakhouse appeal. It had a sense of country diner with a hint of uppity restaurant. \n\nMama fell in love with her bleu cheese stuffed olive Martini. She says they made it very well. The bread they provide as an appetizer is not too shabby. I didn't eat much just so I can save room in the belly for the cow i was going to consume. \n\nBy the way, they dont' offer the promotional Summer menu at the table. You have to ask for it. No big deal. I felt we should be rewarded for doing our homework. Our waiter did inform us that the promo portions are slightly less grandiose than the traditional menu portions. We kind of figured that to be the case. \n\nI ordered the Cajun Marinated Ribeye and mama had the Salmon with lump crabmeat and fingerlings. We were hoping that the portions would be sufficient enough to keep us from going back to Denny's later in the evening. \n\nI guess the non-promotional Ribeye is 22oz. My Summer portion came out to \"only\" 18oz. 18 OUNCES!?!?!?!?! Are you effing kidding me? That thing was huge! The cajun marinade gave a great crust to the outer shell all the while keeping the middle medium and juicy. Mama had already relegated, especially after the watier reiterated, that the \"lump\" crab meat would be sparse. Then it came out. Holy mother of crab. The salmon was pretty much sitting on a bed of Crab Meat. A BED OF CRAB MEAT! I think the chef confused the crab meat for the fingerling potatoes and filled that plate with crab instead of potato. \n\nMy ribeye was absolutely magnificent. Cooked perfectly. Crusty seasoning encased the mouth watering tenderness that was my medium steak. I can't say enough about it without going out to the store right now to buy some red meat.\n\nWhat more can be said about mama's Salmon? I mean, the Salmon was actually the secondary part of that dish. The Crab meat with mushrooms and fingerlings were the star of that plate. Don't get me wrong, the Salmon was delicious, but, the Crab was the star. Absolutley magnificent. \n\nHere are the reasons why no 5star... When we first got seated, there was butter on the seat. Luckily, mama missed sitting on it. The host was very nice about it, wiping it up and asking mama if she wanted to move. Mama declined since she liked our seat. Unfortunately, when I picked up the wine menu, there was butter on that thing too! WTF? I mean, those 2 things dont' kill the night, but, I had higher expectations for restaurant quality. Oh, and because I had told them earlier about mama's birthday, they brought a little cupcake out with a candle. It was very sweet of them, but, it was dryer than the vegas desert.\n\nStill, one of the best dinners we've had in Vegas."

Out of the 4 trips, I have had 2 very good meals and 2 memorable/outstanding meals. \n\nThe first memorable meal was about 5 years ago. Just ordered the filet and 1 side. I ordered it medium rare and it came out crispy on the outside - i knew that it had been overcooked. But upon cutting into it, it was perfect and probably stands as my comparison to all other meals as to what a great steak should taste like.\n\nMy second memorable meal was two weeks ago. I went with business associates so we were a little more liberal in our ordering. I had an Old Fashioned to start that was perfect. Then we ordered the seafood appetizer - remarkable. It had huge tasty shrimp, ridiculously large lump crabmeat, and lobster. Wonderful. Then the spinach salad which was unique, and incredibly tasteful, finished off with a filet and a couple of sides. \n\nWhen I come back to Vegas, I will come back to Smith & Wollensky"

Lobster, Oysters, Shrimp, Mussels, Clams, and Colossal Lump Crabmeat. I've died and gone to Atlantis! If you even think about stopping there, you are gambling your taste buds away. Suck it up and chow down on a Wollensky salad. If Lady Luck blesses you, you'll still have room for the bone-in rib-eye. I spent many mornings gnawing on my leftovers in the hotel room. Sides I would go with include the creamed spinach. Don't ask me about desserts because I never make it that far."

Didn't do any check backs etc.  Took forever to get the check etc.   \n\nWhat really fell out was the wine list.  I ordered a bottle of an 07 Merlot and the waitress brought out an 08 - Same Price of course.  Sent it back.   Asked for any of the 2 2007 California Merlot  - Nope didn't have.  At this point I asked for the Sommelier who was not too interested in dealing with us but finally came through with an 07 that was pretty good.   They shouldn't count on people not paying attention and should have an up to date wine list on what they are actually selling.   I thought it was supposed to be a high end steak house??"

And mine while 3 others were eating. Caesar salad was delicious. Creamed spinach a LOT better at Ruth's Chris as are the steaks. All in all wouldn't ever go again as the prices are too much to get average steak."

I've been on a run over that last 6 months of trying various high-end steakhouses in Las Vegas and Smith & Wollensky's has earned a top spot in my list of the best based solely on the quality, preparation, presentation and overall taste of one kind of steak I'm sampling, that is the bone-in Rib-Eye. This steak at this restaurant is wonderful.  It has a very nice aged beef flavor that complements the tenderness almost buttery quality.  I regard this steak as good as anything you'll find in the $50 to $90 range.  The side-dishes and starts are are very good, but my emphasis is on the STEAK in Steakhouse."

And too their credit, the mac and cheese side was about the best I have ever tried.  We also had a fillet and lobster combo which is highly recommended for those who like the ultimate surf and turf.\n\nI had the dry aged sirloin.  It was flavorful, but, about as tough as a steak could be, plenty of gristle, and not what I expected.   I ordered medium, and got it somewhere between rare and mid rare, not the end of the world, but, when you shell out $400 bucks plus for dinner for 4, one might have higher expectations.\n\nThe server was very friendly, however, didn't appear to have time deal with us.  His insight and suggestions were helpful, but, the service was very slow.  We sat at 6:30 thinking we would be done by 8, and and left about 9:15.\n\nThey did provide a complimentary chocolate cake for the birthday.  We only ate a bite or two while waiting 20 minutes or more for the other dessert to arrive.  When the other dessert arrived, the barely eaten chocolate cake was snatched away from us before we even noticed what happened.  Apparently the waiter assumed we didn't want it  because it hadn't been devoured. \n\nI don't think this is a bad place, it was probably just a bad night for us to be there."

My buddies and I were starving after a day couped up in a rehearsal space writing new music and had the kind of craving only meat and stiff drinks could sate.\n\nInitially we were at the Bellagio trying unsuccessfully to get a steak at \"Prime\" among other places.  (Travel tip - don't expect to get a nice meal at the Bellagio if you're wearing jeans and a sweater that costs under $1,500)  Thank goodness one of my travel partners lives in L.A. and has the type of connections it seems everyone in L.A. has.  He whips out the trusty iPhone and connects with a corporate party planner who knows the good spots in Vegas like it was her second home.  She tells us to hit Smith & Wollensky which is \"just right across the street\".  Little did we know it was in fact across the street......and about a mile down the road next to MGM.  It didn't help that we were in Vegas during a bout of both cold AND wet so we walked swiftly in the cold misty rain with all of the grace of someone holding in a 3 day dump.\n\nWe finally walk into this joint and were transported from the neon glitz of the strip to a corner steak joint somewhere in old town USA.  The decor is basic with decades old sports memorabilia and such on the walls.  We were greeted by an exuberant maitre d' who I'll praise because he noticed our size (6'7\", 6'6\", and 6'3\") and took the time to clear us a table in a spot where we would have plenty of room.\n\nOur server was fantastic.  She was very upbeat and playful and besides the great service she jumped right into our often bawdy and uncensored banter.  We started with manhattans but at the suggestion of our server followed with a round of another house specialty and ended up putting away about a bakers dozen of them between the 3 of us.\n\nWhen it came time for dinner I ordered their largest bone in prime rib mainly because I caught a whiff of the horseradish when I came in the place and my choice was set pretty much right then and there.  I'm not really exaggerating here when I tell you that this was the prettiest cut of meat I ever had set in front of me.  It tasted as good as it looked....aged to perfection and tender enough to melt in your mouth.  One of my buddies got the smaller cut without the bone and he raved about his as I did of mine and his was similarly picture quality.  Our other friend got the bone in NY strip and it looked amazing and by all accounts it was top notch.  The sides come family style and we got the creamed spinach and hashed browns which both complemented the meal nicely.\n\nWe left this place laughing, tipsy, and full to capacity.  You really can't ask for more.  Smith & Wollensky goes on my list next to Craftsteak in MGM of places I'll send people in Vegas when they want a steak they'll think about the other 364 days of the year."

Definitely not worth the over inflated cost.  \n\nOur waiter did take off the missing items from our check, still the bill came to $1060.00.  Unreal how disappointing this experience was.  We do not recommend this restaurant."

Then we shared the house salad- amazing with a warm Dijon dressing. The bacon and \"croutons\" was a nice surprise. Jose ordered the bone in ribeye and I got the veal. Yum yum yum. Extra large sides were the duck fat veggies and the truffle Mac. Both as good as they sound/read. And Nick sent out a slice of cheesecake for the birthday boy. Waved the corkage fee for us... And they have their own valet. Such a great date/birthday dinner. Thanks team!"

I was happy with my bone in rib eye and the Mac & Cheese with truffles was great - BUT \nThe service was very disappointing. It was confused (3 different people serving) and as a result we felt the waiters didn't care about us. Near the end of the meal one waiter asked if we were ready for desert.  My wife said we wanted to finish our wine (2nd bottle). A few minutes later another waiter dropped off a piece of cheese cake that we hadn't ordered.  We all looked at each other - What was going on? Then a few minutes later the leading waiter said it was for our daughter's birthday. That's OK but four people on one piece of cheese cake was not what we were planning on. We were hoping to order cr\u00e8me brulee and I wanted an Irish coffee and the ladies wanted cappuccino of decafs.. Within 3 or 4 minutes another waiter drops off the bill to be paid. What was going on? \nWell to make a long story short I told the lead waiter it was the first time I have ever been at a steak house that didn't even ask me if I wanted a cup of coffee. He acted as if we were finished, which was not the case and he had no idea because neither he nor anyone else ever asked us if we wanted anything after my wife asked for a few minutes to finish the wine.\nI will never go back to ANY SMITH & WOLLENSKY again (either personally or for business). What was a really nice evening turned into a very lousy ending as a result of uncoordinated uncaring wait service. \nTwo thumbs down!!"

It  was a nice they have this since we just walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night.\nI was excited to come here, my parents spoke highly of it and people really seemed to like the Mac and Cheese here. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed with the food I got. \nFirst off, skip the world famous split pea soup.. there is nothing great about it. I got the filet minon with the Gorgonzola cheese on top. It sounded good, however I found it was over powering and I ended up scraping it off. I should of just gone with it grilled normally. The Mac and Cheese was o.k.... still many levels below the Mac and Cheese you get at Del Friscos.\nMy wife got the Bone in rib eye which I enjoyed much more than my filet, however we both agreed it was  a bit over charred and seasoned with a heavy hand. \nThe lone good thing was that they had a lighter portion menu of pretty much everything on the normal menu. Its a nice option.\nWith so many steak house options in Vegas, I doubt I will be back."

The Truffle Macaroni and Cheese as well as the Cajun steaks were some of the best we had ever had. Our server, Heidi, was absolutely abysmal. She was rude, condescending and one of the worst servers I have ever been in contact with. She told us it would take hours to separate alcoholic drinks from the rest of the bill. We were assured several times that two servers would be serving the party, but we never saw anyone but her. When this concern was expressed, she of course was rude and quick to say it was under control.\n\nThe low point of our experience was three people in our party missing their meals. The server was so awful that she didn't even realize this, and when it was brought up she made sure to say it wasn't her fault. After a 30 minute wait, the other people finally got their food (by now everyone was finished).\n\nHeidi then took her server pad and threw it down, consequently breaking a plate.\n\nBy this time, I had had enough. I promptly went to the manager and expressed my concern. The management was wonderful and understanding. They really made the night better and without such great staff (with the obvious exception of Heidi), this night would have been forfeit completely."

The restaurant is located on the exuberant Vegas strip.\n\nIf dining indoors, the decor is has a hint of western influence, as it is slightly saloon-like. We dined outdoors on the patio located parallel to the strip's pedestrian traffic. This made for a bit of natural entertainment throughout our meal.\n\nThe food was tasty and moderately priced. I had a steak with a side of mushrooms while my friend enjoyed lobster tail. This restaurant provided one of the better dining experiences I had in my short visit to the city. \n\nThe service was great. Our waiter was friendly and attentive..... and somewhat psychic. He gave us a generous birthday dessert at the end of the meal. It was my friend's birthday, but I didn't inform him of this and neither did my friend. Hmmm....\n\nBottom line, I would recommend this restaurant to locals and visitors."

Well apparently I do because I did not want to order a dinner so I could enjoy my appetizer, salad and dessert. Don't get me wrong. It's was a delicious $19 burger.

            "review": "I was more excited to try this place than Delmonico's! I've been wanting to come here for decades & when Restaurant Week featured this restaurant as one of their participants.. I smiled & jumped on the opportunity to finally dine here. \n\nThe valet attendant was prompt in taking my car in & directed us to the entrance. As my Father & I walked in, we were greeted instantly by two friendly hostesses & sat us right away to a nice booth as requested.\n\nNow here is where things went downhill. Our server, an older Caucasian male seem to be taking care of the back section of the room, came over & handed us our menus. We ordered a Acqua Panna bottle & when he came back with it.. I asked him about the baked potato side dish if it was served for one or two guests.. he told me that's only for one person. I told him we're here for Restaurant Week & we're ready to order. At that exact moment of saying those words, we became nonexistence to him. Service went from 100 to zero in a split second. He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about & then said.. Oh the Restaurant Week menu.. I'll go get that.. I guess you won't be needing these & took the regular menus with him. When he came back with the RW menus, he took off when I was half way letting him know we were ready to order. WOW really?! He passed by not once, but eight times without even acknowledging us. I finally waved my hand as he was passing by & said we're ready to order & he puts his index finger in the air, noting to me to wait. We watched this rude server walk back & forth taking his time to other tables, probably not participating in RW, giving them the kind of service we never received. My blood began to boil, because this wasn't an ordinary outing. My only day off & I took my Father here to celebrate a belated Father's Day. I would think I chose a great place to make him feel special in this nice steakhouse that's been here forever, but I was completely wrong. WE felt like nobodys after I said we're here for Restaurant Week. If you're a participant for this wonderful program of giving back to our community that needs it more than anything, why are you not wanting to share it with your guests or even supporting a great cause?! In return, we were treated like a peasant for wanting to give back & share a good meal together. At that very moment, I had enough. As soon as I saw the next staff member, I told him I want to talk to your manager right now. The rude server that was in the next room probably heard me, since he came over after I said that & acted all nonchalant with.. so you ready to order? My look at his face.. I wish someone was there to take a picture. I told him.. Actually no, I'm going to talk to your manager first. And look who's behind him.. the manager. I explained to the manager what happened and told him straightforwardly.. I want a different server immediately. As soon as those words came out of my mouth, the manager unhesitatingly took care of this matter and like a shot.. here came Jinho. There's the one star comeback. His service was 100x better. Like night and day compared to the rude server we had. So welcoming & attentive.. he read our minds with what we wanted to ask for without even having to ask! Now that's the kind of service every restaurant should provide, especially being a well known steakhouse here in Las Vegas. When he asked if we would like any side dishes, I mentioned the baked potato and on the double he goes.. that's a good choice.. it's a big portion that both of you can share. Rude, greedy server of \"no that's only for one person\" to this server letting me know we can share it. It was more of a self serve kind of place, poured my Father some more water as well as myself. Or maybe that's just for RW guests.\n\nAppetizer of Tomato Carpaccio with Burrata was decent. Nothing spectacular. Food runner dropped off a few Ribeyes and sides that were for the table in front of us. I told the runner, this isn't our order. He looked at it, then looked at the table in front of us and flat-out took everything back to the cariton. The table in front of us saw what happened and we, both shared a laugh. Then a few seconds later our food came out and the runner goes.. let's try this again, it's like a deja vu. My filet mignon on one side was completely burnt to a black crisp. I had to cut it off and discard it. The baked potato was simply what it was, but good toppings of butter, sour cream, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese. NY Cheesecake was light and soft. The star of the night.. Chocolate Cake was DELICIOUS! We took it home. My Mother ate a few bites and said.. this is the best tasting cake I ever had. I have to agree.. I couldn't stop eating it!!!\n\nOne star for the valet that had my car parked and ready for me when I came out, another star for the prompt action of the manager in getting me another server, and our server, Jinho for making up for the lack of another. Minus two stars for the rude server that treated us cold as winter."

Had a side of creamed spinach. My bench mark for that is from IZZY's in San Francisco. This creamed spinach tasted like frozen chopped spinach with some bland cream. Seltzer water was a small bottle of Canada dry. Low class for this sort of eatery. My rib steak came out over cooked. I sent it back and got a new one and it was perfect!

The ambiance was a little stuffy, with much older patrons.\n\nAfter a hefty bill, satisfaction peered through our protruding bellies."

            "review": "Wow, I absolutely loved this place! I'm as picky as they get when it comes to my steak. I've been to so many steakhouses and a lot of them just don't get it right even when they charge you an arm and a leg. Well, Smith and Wollensky has it right. From the friendly hostesses at the front door, the assistant helping clean the table, the super friendly waitstaff to the delicious steak. I mean wow! I'm impressed. \n\nFirst we started with a wedge salad. We didn't want to eat too much and ruin our appetite so me and my hubby split it. They were kind enough to split it for us. Perfect portions, super fresh greens and yummy blue cheese dressing. Next came the filet Oscar steak and truffle mac and cheese. I requested medium rare and it was just that. Perfect flavor, juicy, covered with delicious lump crab meat and asparagus. Yum! The Truffle Mac and cheese was to die for. Melt in your mouth cheesy wonderfulness. I also tried my hubby's filet au poivre and the sauce was simply sinful. Nothing short of perfect. \n\nTo top it all off the staff was super friendly. We were Christmas Day diners and they gave us each a $25 bonus card for dining with them on the holiday. The card can be used between January thru end of February. What a pleasant surprise and gift. Our waiter was also just phenomenal. Big shout out to John from Jersey. Attentive, helpful, knowledgeable and kind. \n\nI can't say enough good things about this place. I used to be a huge Ruth's Chris advocate and would tell people that there's no one better than Ruth's Chris. Well, S&W officially proved me wrong. I don't think I've ever been treated as well as I was treated at S&W. It's official. S&W you've made a fan out of me! I'll be back sooner than later! Thanks for an amazing Christmas dinner!"

During this time we went to the bar and got a drink. He got a jack and coke and I got pink moscato-very good. We sat in the back of the restaurant-I didn't realize how big the restaurant is! From the outside it looks smaller. \n\nOnce we sat down we received our menus. I feel that this deal for restaurant week is the best. For $40.13 you get three courses ($10 more if you order the filet for the second course) You also get this amazing bread! It is cooked inside a pan and is fresh. For the first course I got the Wollensky salad. I really liked it. It came with potato croutons and bacon which really made the salad. For my second course I got the deconstructed Beef Wellington. It was sooo good! It doesn't look like your normal beef Wellington which made it unique. My Uncle got the coffee and cocoa rubbed filet which I tried as well. Even though it sounds like a weird combo it wasn't at all. It tasted delicious. If you are to get a filet here I would recommend that one. Then for dessert I got the Coconut Cake with the passion fruit sauce and my uncle got the chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and we split both of them. Both were great because dessert is always good in my book but my favorite was the Coconut Cake. The passion fruit sauce made it so fruity and tasty. I would definitely want to come back here another time.  \n\nGreat service and great food. :)"

Classic designs and we got our own private room. We had a huge group of 18 people and they didn't charge extra for the room or have any minimum purchase per person like other steakhouses did. They even accommodated moving our reservation back 30 minutes and us arriving about 10 minutes late after that (some of us may have been tired from some Vegas activities...) One complaint was that the music was a little loud, we asked them to turn it down and they gladly did.\n\nService: awesome! 5 stars. Both the waiters were very personable and helpful. The main waiter took time to explain the whole menu. They joined in on some conversation and made it a great experience. They were very quick to seat us, zero complaints here.\n\nFood: 3 stars. I have a thing for trying ribeyes at different steakhouses and this lands somewhere in the middle. It is a huge portion but I think it seemed a little bland and dry. I didn't get any rubs, just the steak. I would probably opt for an enhancement or cajun next time. We pretty much got all the sides on the menu and those were great. I really liked the lobster mac & cheese (if you like it creamy) and mushrooms (great companion to the steaks). They also gave complimentary bread that was in a caprese style which was delicious. \n\nAlso you can't beat the location of this place, right on the strip and you don't have to walk through a hotel to get there. You can get dropped off right at the front in case you're strapped for time. Overall a great experience. Top notch service, and while the steak wasn't the best I've ever had, everything else was superb."

I had never been to a two story steakhouse let alone a three story steakhouse.  We huffed it up the stairs and built up our appetites for what was to come.\n\nCrab Cake Appetizer:  Decently sized shredded crab meat, deep fried crusty outer with a juicy delicious center.  Nicely done!\n\nSalad with Blue Cheese Dressing and Blue Cheese Crumbles.  This also was quite tasty.  Almost too tasty as you want to finish the whole thing, and yet also save room for the later courses.\n\nFilet Mignon:  A nice 2+\" cut, cooked to a perfect medium rare.  A few of the orders on our table got mixed up, but mine's was done right.  The meat was tasty, but I'm not a big fan of the Bernaise Sauce that accompanied it.\n\nMacaroni & Cheese with Truffle Oil:  Delicious, but also quite rich and heavy.  If you're suffering from insomnia, this dish will definitely put you down for the count.\n\nSteamed Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce:  A classic side dish which is almost impossible to mess up.\n\nMashed Potatoes:  Their take on this included finely chopped chives.  It was quite smooth and went well with the meat.\n\nCongrats again Jen & Ryan!"

It was nothing fancy, but it allowed us to have a clear view of the kitchen and it was nice to watch the chefs at work.  This stand alone restaurant is located on the strip and is unassuming.  I highly recommend the bone in filet.  You have a choice of steak preparations and we chose the au poivre style where they put a thin layer of coarsely ground pepper on the steak and sear it to perfection.  Our steak was perfectly cooked and leaving the bone in definitely makes a difference. I've had this style of steak at many other places and this is one of the best I've had.  It was just the perfect amount of seasoning and flavor without overpowering the integrity of the steak itself.  It tasted even better with a side of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms we ordered with each bite of your steak.  \nThe truffled Mac and cheese was creamy and tasty, but I am never a fan of this dish at any establishment. I find that most places use truffle oil which I don't particularly like.  This may come off a little pretentious, but I only like freshly sliced truffles with my food.  If you want great truffle Mac and cheese, you must go to the Waverly Inn located in NYC. They actually shave a generous portion of fresh truffles on top of your Mac and cheese at tableside. \nThe wallenski salad had mushrooms, bacon lardons, and fried potato cubes was decent. They do serve the best split pea soup I've ever had as well.  All in all I enjoyed my dining experience here."

Sadly, no more. \n\nThis is a long overdue correction and amplification of the review below. The manager contacted me. He was gracious and apologized...and refunded what we spent, which I did not expect. My comments below still stand, but I'll have to believe that our waiter that night was an anomaly and not the norm. I usually love Smith & Wollensky and will go back to this location in Las Vegas and have been to several other locations after this review. It's about time I corrected what's below. I also went from one star to 4 stars because of the locations terrific general manager.  \n\n I've been to at least 7 or 8 other Smith & Wollensky properties around the US. This meal, in a word, sucked. It wasn't so much that the food was so bad (it was not even good though), it was that the waiter lied. Flat out lied.\n\nThere were only 3 of us. Two ordered a filet and I ordered the aged rib steak. My steak was not an aged piece of meat. I know aged meat. It was fatty with a kind of fat that is not the texture seen in aged beef. It didn't have the rich beefy flavor that aged steak attains. It was also a bit overcooked...to about medium. Additionally, it shrank too much to be aged. When the food was delivered to the table, one of the filets was missing. The waiter said he put the order in. He didn't. We saw him put it into the computer. He had forgotten to put it in. I told him to take the two steaks back to the kitchen to re-fire and he said the one that was left in the kitchen would be out in a minute. It wasn't. It took 7 minutes. We timed it. By the time the third steak came out...neither of us wanted to eat without the other steak on the table...my $50 rib was cold and when our third guest finally cut into her filet, it was not medium rare...it was medium raw. Totally raw and cold in the middle. First, the waiter tried to say it was correct. It was blue, which is rarer than rare. He reluctantly took the steak back to the kitchen and it came back medium, not medium rare. We gave up. The manager sent over one of the massive desserts, which was nice but really didn't change the overall tenor of the meal.\n\nThe wine I ordered came with a different vintage. I really don't appreciate that. And it's beneath a restaurant wine list that's supposed to be the 'caliber' of S & W's wine list. Just because this S& W is on the Las Vegas strip doesn't mean the service, the wine list and the management suck. But they do. S&W here probably thinks that everyone is a tourist and will never darken their door again. Well, for sure i won't darken their door and I'm in Las Vegas at least 3 times a year and used to eat at S&W almost every time along with recommending this restaurant. No more.\n\nBad table waiting, bad management, bad food all around.\n\nToo bad. It could be a great oasis on the strip."

I've been to a fair amount of steakhouses, and Smith & Wollensky is about as good as it gets.  I'd been here once before, but it was quite as excellent the second time.\n\nOur server, Mark, was exactly as attentive as he should have been - which is a lot harder than it sounds.  It means he was there when we needed something, but he also wasn't hovering over us while we were eating, asking \"is everything okay?\"\n\nI also have to give him credit for suggesting the truffled mac and cheese, which is incredible and almost certainly a lot better than the whipped potatoes I'd been planning to order as a side.  I can see why, as Mark noted, people come back just for this dish.  I could certainly see just sitting at the bar with a dish of that mac and cheese and a martini and then going home happy and fulfilled.\n\nBut of course where the rubber meets the road with steakhouses is whether the steak is good or not.  And the answer at Smith & Wollensky is:  Heck yeah.  If you don't like them grilled at blazing heat to produce a dark sear on the outside, you won't like it, but if you do, if you like that char, then you definitely will like this place.  The meat itself is obviously high quality, at least as high as you would get at any other high-end steakhouse."
