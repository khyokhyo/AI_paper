            "review": "After logging in some time at the Daylight day club we were hungry and looking for a good place to get our grub on within Mandalay Bay. A friend remembered having a good experience here so we figured it should be pretty good. Well, it fell a little short of the mark with pricey food and slow service. My tuna melt was good, but it better damn well be for $16! The accompanying seasoned criss-cut fries were a tad overdone, making them overly crunchy. The service was nice but slow; it seemed like it took forever for the food to come out and we were HUNGRY. It was crowded, to be sure, with 4th of July weekend and the MMA fights and all, but it seemed like they should've anticipated this and staffed appropriately. Not a special destination in my book."

Delicious. \n\nLike the atmosphere and staff was friendly & attentive. 3 stars because they gave me veggies that should have been tossed out but instead served it to me - great presentation though. \n\nCustomer service 5 stars. \nSoup: 4 stars."

            "review": "I stay at Mandalay Bay for two weeks at a time about 5 times a year so I am always looking for a place to eat. Citizens is ok but the customer service is lacking. The food is pretty typical of what you get in Vegas prep aired to an average standard at an inflated price. The staff is also pretty typical Vegas, lacK of experience with a pulse. I often dine alone since my trips are for business. I work for one of the shows out here so I am always around the building. The often blank stare no personality hostess is put off by having to seat one and will always try and get you to sit at the bar. The bar with its uncomfortable foo foo hard plastic bar stools is always loud due to its hard tile surfaces. The service is unpredictable depending on who is working at the bar. The take out can be a good option but it's take it as it is. Pre made and don,t ask for it any other way. Once again young no personality who gives a shit attitude. Even Burger King will give it to you your way if you ask at a fraction of the price. They are open all the time which is a plus since I often finish working late."

Buttery, thick, shale-like layers with a generous amount of raspberry filling and crumbles on top. The banana chip muffin was okay, but the chips were interesting in that they melted at the slightest touch. If I blew on it, three chips disinegrated immediately! \n\nWhen I asked for the banana chip muffin, they accidentally gave me banana bread, and when I went back to the counter to exchange it, they told me to keep it so I gave it to my homie who said it was the best thing of the 5 things we got. \n\nWith so many other bakery options on the Strip, I wouldn't make a special trip here, but it was nice that they had counter seating available for snackers like us :)"

Basic food that will help you get on your way, and isn't fastfoody and greasy.  If you are from Southern California, think of it as an expensive, upscale Corner Bakery.\n\nThe items I got here were the turkey and avocado sandwhich (Very good, even at $14) and the breakfast burrito (decent, at $14).\n\nYou pay top dollar for being in the lobby of a top-notch Casino/Hotel (Mandalay Bay), so if you're looking for a dollar menu, call a taxi and have them take you off the strip.  Food on the strip will always have twice the price tag."

The cob salad is perfect. I liked their clean fresh decor. \n\nThe service was mixed. Depending of who's working there, you may or may not have a good experience. I often walked by to see if I Katie was working at the bar. If she was, I'd definitely walk in for a meal. You need more like her Citizens."

            "review": "A few colleagues and I stopped by Citizens Kitchen and Bar located in the Mandalay Bay Hotel on the evening of Monday, October 17th.  I ordered the French Dip which consisted of thin sliced prime rib, caramelized onions, Provolone cheese, and Au Jus.  It came with a side of fries (which were hot temperature wise and salted perfectly) and a pickle spear.  It was somewhat challenging to dip in the Au Jus because of the bread.  It was more of a hoagie bun and full of meat, so it made it hard to get that big sandwich into the little \"cup\" of Au Jus.  However, when I was able to dip it, it was good.\n\nJustin, our waiter, was FANTASTIC!!!  He was very talkative and friendly, and checked up on us quite a bit to ensure that we had everything we needed.  He is an asset to the restaurant.\n\nIf you are hungry late night, or anytime really, then sneak into Citizens for a bite.  You'll walk away happy!"

The tacos has big filets of fish , rather than the usual chunks.  Fish was delicious as well as the entire taco.  Bustling, but relaxed atmosphere, good service even though the place was busy.  I also tried the Ginger Snap juice smoothie - was very good.  There was a choice of 6-8 juice smoothies.  This place offers comfort food, but plenty of healthy options too.  We saw a few burgers come past - they looked great."

Food presentation was beautiful.  unfortunately the fish was over cooked and the potato salad, al though made in house, lacked flavor. In the end our bill was $50 for a mediocre meal. The fish and chips was definitely over priced, $26!"

We are still sitting here and it's blasting. Extremely inappropriate for a morning setting. We ordered coffee and water and received those pretty quickly. Not sure what is up with the water here, but it was disgusting. We also received them in skinny glasses without ice, while tables around us received them in bigger glasses with ice.

Basically we just sat and ate while trying to avoid seeing women wearing dresses so short we could literally see butt cheeks! Also, the club is SO LOUD that we couldn't even talk during our meal.

The interesting thing about this place that I did not know at first is that they have an actual restaurant and they also have a to-go area where all of the salads and sandwiches are basically pre-made and ready to be sold. I came here twice on my most recent visit and ate once at the restaurant and I also got some food to-go the other time.\n\nWhen I did eat at the restaurant, the service was great. The host was very nice and so was the server. The manager even stopped by to ask how my meal was going. They definitely take customer service seriously here which is a good thing!\n\nFood:\nChicken Cobb Salad- Chicken, cheese, egg, cucumber, tomato and bacon. The salad was pretty good and refreshing. They also give you a choice of what dressing you want, but I stuck with the typical cobb salad dressing which is bleu cheese. $18\n\nTurkey Avocado- Turkey, cheese, sprouts, tomato, lettuce, avocado, lemon aioli on a cranberry walnut bread. A really good sandwich for the most part. It tasted really healthy which is good since I always eat the worst food while I'm in Vegas. $18\n\nFrench Dip Steak- Thin sliced prime rib, caramelized onions, provolone cheese and au jus. Served with cole slaw and a pickle. This was probably one of the best tasting French dips that I've had. Towards the end it started to be a little on the salty side, but overall I thought it was a delicious sandwich. $19\n\nTypically, I would probably lower it to 3 stars since the prices are pretty high for the amount of food, but it is Vegas and nothing in Vegas is cheap. I've spent over $10 on a lousy piece of pizza before so I'd rather spend $20+ on a delicious sandwich! I would definitely recommend Citizens Kitchen & Bar to anyone that is at the Mandalay Bay and is looking for your typical American food."

The waiter took my order, and checked on me about a minute after my food was delivered, and then disappeared.

Nobody checked on me- I was just ignored. After about 15 minutes- I gave up and waved the waiter down for my bill. I went next door to Starbucks for coffee and dessert.\n\nI don't like being constantly bothered by waiters, but I would think if someone's drink is empty or they are clearly done eating- they would make some effort to see if the diner wants something else.

I'm here at the JC K jewelry show and I must eat quick and I must eat good and healthy and with a lot of taste yes that's what I like and I have happen to find that for my morning take in my lunch and also dinner if I'm not going to fancy restaurant here at the citizens the service is fast the food is delicious and extremely well prepared from the Apple cinnamon muffin which is my favorite to the kale salad which has an anonymous amount of taste try it you'll be addicted."

The waiter was great, very attentive and at one point seemed like he was going to sit down with us to tell us about every item on the menu - maybe he was new.  The first hint was during a conference with 30,000 people this place had tons of open tables.  Food was not so great at dinner - ribs were not great, wings were not great, rice bowl was not great, fries were not great, get the picture?  I guess it's better for breakfast in the AM but there isn't much else open either at that time of day.  Bar looked well stocked, I will give them that.  Pricey for what it was, I think the hotel should tear this out and make a bigger Starbucks, they would have happier customers.  Sorry, go in for a drink or coffee and you'll be fine - avoid the food."

Super crisp and refreshing exactly what I wanted. It tasted like a cool summer day.\n\nLunch:\nMy All American comfort meal the Blue Beat, included Blue Cheese, Red Wine Mushrooms & Cherry Peppers. Although the burger was cooked to perfect (medium rare). I felt this burger lacked sauce, it was very dry and hard to eat. The mushrooms were barely sauteed almost raw.

Most of the portions are large enough to split, so keep that in mind and ask your server if you are unsure. The sandwiches are tasty, we usually stop in and grab something to go to take to the pool but Thursday after we checked in we decided to eat at the restaurant. Honestly we've had way better service and the waitress had a bit of an attitude but I think she may have been a little overwhelmed with the amount of tables she was waiting on. Plus she had to deal with a few people who purchased food at the take out counter then decided it was ok to sit in the restaurant - I blame the hostess for this, neither seemed to know what they were doing. I can't remember what sandwich we ordered but we asked to split it and we each got our own fries - no split there! We also ordered the mixed green salad and the white balsamic dressing was fantastic. With the sandwich, salad and two drinks I think our bill was a little over $20. We also stopped in for breakfast one morning, the omelet was a disappointment so just skip that all together. No flavor, weird texture, not worth the $$$. My husband ordered the French Toast and that was amazing, it came with an orange flavored whip cream that was light, citrusy and paired well with the French Toast and berries. \n\nTo sum this up:\n1. make the walk back from the pool and get take out. trust me you'll be happier with this then ordering food from the pool. \n2. Most items can be split\n3. Skip the omelet, order the French Toast"

The cocktails we had at lunch were pretty decent. \n\nBreakfast we had waffles and eggs... its hard to screw those up. \n\nAt 4am I don't recall exactly what we were eating.. I think it was probably waffles and french fries. The point is, they were open at 4 am and serving the entire menu! We couldn't get room service at the Delano at that time so Citizens saved us. \n\nIn sum, this place isn't fancy or all that great food-wise. It's basically like a diner (just more expensive than your average diner). I wouldn't eat dinner here but for a casual breakfast or lunch its just dandy."

It was too full grilled cheese sandwiches with a great beef patty and caramelized grilled onions in it. Oh the grilled cheese sandwiches also had great slices of tomato inside of them and a patty melt itself had lettuce shreds inside of it. My wife had the same thing and we both knew this flavor from something else. Then all of a sudden it hit us - - please anybody doublecheck this going forward, but this grilled cheese patty melt taste almost exactly like an In-and-Out Burger Double Double. The service was good and attentive. Oh, I almost forgot we had the fried calamari as an appetizer and it was ok. The only real complaint was that the sandwich was extremely messy to eat and hard to control. With the size this thing there's no way around it. My wife's pickle spear was huge compared to the anorexic pickle spear that I got, just sayin'."

It also was one of the few full menu places in Mandalay that stayed open late. Surprisingly most of the food spots shut down at around midnight. \n\nCitizens was a bit of a hit and miss. Two of the four times I came it was great. The other two were just ok. I liked that they had 3 sections (bar, restaurant and counter). The counter was a quick line that basically had sandwich, salad, coffee and other quick items available for immediate purchase. This was convenient for conference breaks as I was able to just run over, grab some pre-made foods and coffee before heading back. The restaurant and bar were nice for late night dinners. We came here twice to eat at the restaurant portion. The food was ok. The only thing I ordered here that I hated was the mixed green salad. The leaves were very bitter and the dressing was sub-par. Most of the other dishes we ordered were good, but nothing stood out as extraordinary. \n\nEverything here was overpriced. As I mentioned it's a convenient spot and it's open late so they're able to get away with the prices... But don't expect the quality to match the price.\n\nThe service was on and off. We had one server who was great. The barista and employees behind the counter were also good. But we also had a server who was terrible. But overall it had decent service.  \n\nThe number one thing this place has going for them is the convenience of location and hours."

The decor is nice and casual with a pretty open floor plan. There are big windows that allow you to people watch while you eat. We went there twice because they are the only place open 24 hrs. Before the club I had the chicken penne. The penne was cooked perfectly but the sauce to pasta ratio was way off, the penne was swimming. After the club I had the fish and chips. The cod is nice and large but its the breading that killed the dish for me. The cod was beer battered but there was so much beer in the batter, it made my fish taste like fried bud light. Way too over powering to finish not even hot sauce could save it. Id go back if in Vegas again but I would just try my luck with other items."

They had a great breakfast menu that you can get to-go to include espresso drinks. The wait for the food isn't too bad. The price is reasonable considering you are at a Vegas resort. They have several smoothie options and their sandwiches are stuffed with lots of meat.

Over the phone would be great if they answered their phones.  I've tried three times to place phone orders, the first time after 43 min of calling and getting the hotel involved they would not answer their phone, I ended up driving down there to place my order.  Second time I came here I decided to try calling again. Yayyyy they picked up the phone...then put me on hold... an hour and 38 min later I drove down still being on hold to show them that no one is answering and that I was on hold for an hour and 38 min.  I spoke with the manager (Shawn) and  he apologized and said there must be something wrong with the phones.  I called as he was standing there and voila they worked fine.  Weird.  Today a month later, I decided to try my luck one more time.  Driving past state line I called and someone answered the phone yayyyyy... NOPE. Again placed on hold and drove all the way to the Mandalay again to show the same manager that I've been on hold 38 min.    He apologized and again gave me there must be something wrong with the phone schpeal.  Tried calling while standing there and holy cow the phones worked.   When I was on hold all of these times I tried calling on three way to see if they would pick up and the phone just rang and rang. \n\nBack to today, I placed my order to be told they are all out of the bread that my 5 sandwiches come on..  I asked for a croissant instead and a girl named  Heather said you need to pay extra for that.  Super condescending and rude.  The only one that handled this professionally was Sarah.  Jessica decided to come to me and directly  say you need to move your bags(the food) they just brought out to me off the counter.  She argued in front of the customers and two other customers stated that the customer service is horrible.  Was this girl for real??? After everything I've been put through she is raising her voice in front of other guest and telling me to move my food bags in a condescending voice.  Ughhh.  So sad the food is really good here but they need to clean house and hire staff that knows how to work with guests.  Thanks Sarah for your help!   Shawn the manager just kind of looked at me glossy eyed  both times I spoke to him so I'm not sure he's going to address the issues at hand.  Some how the staff acted as if I was in the wrong here.  Please citizens get it together. Mandala is an amazing place this restaurant should be ran with the same customer service as the place it's in.   So sad"

After a long drive and just before Jamie arrived, I was feeling mighty peckish but recognized dining options at a pricey resort are not so inclusive of solitary cheapskates like me. As I strolled among the restaurants and the hostesses in their strapless gowns, I came upon Citizens which turned out to be a slightly upscale 24-hour diner and bar. It's about three years old, so I wasn't familiar with the place.\n\nI took a look at the menu and noticed it was all-American comfort food with Vegas prices. I have to say I was starving since I had not eaten since an early morning breakfast at SFO airport. The $15 Caesar sounded good to me, but I didn't want to use up room in my belly reserved for meat. The server offered a small version for $5, which was frankly quite abundant by itself with plenty of romaine drenched in a lemon garlic dressing topped with a Parmesan crisp (photo: http://bit.ly/21GGabO). It wasn't an artful plate but it certainly hit the spot. Now back to the size thing I was alluding to before. I decided to throw caution to the wind and ordered the $36 Citizens Prime Rib Dinner, oh yes, by far the most expensive thing on the menu.\n\nWhat came out was a sizable cut of beef on the rare side but slow roasted apparently for 18 hours. It was satisfying enough with a nice crust though not as juicy or laden with au jus as I was hoping. There was a bit of sour cream on the side though surprisingly no horseradish. I should have asked for it, but the place was starting to hop at that hour. It came with a loaded baked potato heavy with a molten cheddar though the spud itself was a tad on the lukewarm side, while the steamed broccoli turned out to be one chewy stalk that required a sawing motion to get it into digestible portions (photo: http://bit.ly/1pnnNuG). I couldn't finish the meat, so I took the rest back to the room where there was serious gnawing throughout the weekend.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...hits the spot when you're hungry and portions are abundant (consider the prices) but nothing really transcended\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...spacious enough for a resort restaurant\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...servers buzz around a lot but pay attention when it matters\nTOTAL - 3 stars...definitely a more reasonably priced option anytime you want it at Mandalay Bay"

My coworkers and I ordered a round of drinks first, they too have a nice beer list, cocktails and wine list to get you going.  \n\nWe decided to get some potato skins as an appetizer and it was pretty good, thick cut potato wedge with some bacon sprinkled on top and of course melty cheese on top with green onions. \nYou get 4 per order with guac, sour cream and pico.  We were quite hungry so we devoured it in minutes.  \n\nAs for my main, I got the Mahi Tacos, 3 grilled Mahi pieces with all the normal fixin's such as pico de gallo, cabbage and avocado slices. Served with their usual friends of guac, sour cream and more pico. Fish was nicely cooked and good sized pieces and flavorful.  Anything with avocado or guacamole makes it that much better.  \n\nForgot what my coworkers ordered but they enjoyed their first Vegas meal very much. Stayed a bit longer to have a few more drinks so no room for dessert.  \n\nStaff was fine, quite friendly, attentive and quick and helpful with making suggestions. No issues with our dining experience. If you don't want to sit in the dining room, there is a counter/walk up area where you can order to go.

The chicken was pretty good and moist and it came with a generous helping of potatoes and also a ginormous head of broccoli which was good. On top of that I ordered a side of brown rice to fill me up because eat larabars all day couldn't fill me up. The food itself was a 3.5-4 not knock your socks off but not terrible. What pulled this down to a 3 was the amount of time the food took to come out considering the place was relatively empty when we were there. I think the chef forgot our order. They actually sent out a Caesar salad to apologize so that was a nice gesture, would rather have had them discount the meal given I'm not eating the creamy dressings on salads anymore. \n\nHey if you need a quicker meal, you don't want to pay $80 for a salad and Le Fluer then give Citizens a shot, I'm sure the food order being overlooked isn't common and I'd change he review in the future if so."

The chili was to DIE for.  Very mild with chunks of premium beef.  Tasted devine with sour cream.  The waffle cut fries were delicious and arrived in this cute little basket thing.  Which actually seem to be like the thing to do in Vegas now.  Must be a hipster chef thing.\n\nThe chicken wings were WAY spicy but my husband enjoyed them.\n\nI really like this place for a quick treat.

The space, redecorated from its previous goofy pseudo-diner style, is quite nice, masculine and casual yet well-appointed, with a classy bar and the now-ubiquitious but still pretty old style light bulbs. Sat at the bar and had friendly and attentive service. \n\nThe breakfast was standard - eggs/toast/sausage/potatoes were like \"diner plus\" with a flavorful pepper mixed in with the potatoes and thick texas style toast. Fine. The major disappointment was dinner. I went in craving something just barely healthy (after a few days in Vegas I was desperate for a vegetable) and the main recommended entree at Citizens is a chicken/brocolli/potato plate that looked great. Unfortunately the execution was inexcusably poor, especially for a \"signature\" dish. The chicken was flavorless and dry, even with the skin left on. Broccoli rabe was undercooked and also flavorless, and the potato quarters were the least cooked of all, with a full half of them too hard to even cut with a fork, and inedible. Everything sat in a plate full of broth, perhaps that's in an attempt to disguize the dryness and blandless of the food, but even the broth doesn't help. Chow in San Francisco does this chicken/brussel sprouts/mashed potato dish that's just bursting with flavor and juiciness, and it's like 12 bucks. This $25 plate was just sad and pointless. Again, like so much in Vegas in general, it's an opportunity to spend twice as much on something half as good."

Mixed w/ ham and peas and crunchy bread crumbs on top, it was a good side dish.\n\nWhile the food was not bad, the price was astronomical.  The pasta, for example, was $30 w/ chicken.   While it was enough pasta to probably feed two people, I can't help but feel bad afterwards for spending that much on one pasta in a place that's not really 'fancy'.

After looking at the outrageous prices at some of the other restaurants we decided on eating here as it wasn't crowded at 1pm on Saturday afternoon. Average price of a meal was somewhere between $10-16 and they had a very quick moving to go line. \nCame here on a sat around 1:30 with 6 people, 5 min wait to be seated. The food was a different story. Ray was our server. He was so sweet but we waited over 30min for our food even though the restaurant was less than 1/2 full. \nAs my friend said: \"this is the quintessential restaurant that needs to serve bread or chips.\" The waiting time was horrible as everyone in the restaurant can see the kitchen and see the food being lined up and just waiting to come to the table. \nWe ordered fish tacos, loco moco and frisco melt.\n1)Fish tacos came with 3 tacos and all the fixings: gauc, salsa and sour cream\n2)Locomoco was a substantial size but pretty pricey for 17$ and IT IS NOT A BURGER. it is literally rice served with a hamburger patty and gravy and an egg overeasy. Really not sure why it is listed under the burger section\n3) 2 of us order the FRISCO MELT: totally bomb and the price of 16$ on the strip was great. Melty melty cheese with sourdough bread and fried onions served with mayo and ketchup and French fries on the side. \nMouth already watering even just thinking about it. Great meal for a pre-drinking night on the strip.\nWould come here again. Price was reasonably and food was good. Service a totally different story. \n\nThe funniest part of this place is that the atmosphere music was that CD \"That what I call music\" circa 1999"

The food was great on our first visit and the server accommodating to dietary needs and requests making us fall in love with the place.   The second visit, our server was totally slammed and he was very much absent minded, leaving us to wait over 20 minutes for a Mimosa from the clearly empty bar next to us.   He also wasn't really down with the hospitality and wouldn't let my guest order the exact same thing she enjoyed the day before which struck me as a little odd.   Had we not been in a hurry, we would have probably asked to see a Manager but it was so busy we just sucked up and left.   What a difference a day makes......"

My coworker ordered a burger and asked for no onions on it. I ordered the fish tacos. We waited a good 25 minutes for our food, which is an eternity in lunch hour time, and the restaurant wasn't even close to full. When our food arrived, my coworkers burger had onions on it. He stated this to the waitress and she just gave him a dead stare and then walked off. He picked them off, and said the rest of the burger was ok. \n\nThe fish tacos were itty bitty. I was confused and wondered if I had accidentally ordered off the appetizer menu, but nope....they were listed as one of the lunch specialities of the place. The three tiniest fish tacos of my life were not worth the $24 price tag attached to them, especially since my only \"sides\" were tiny cups of pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole to put on the tiny tacos. If, after spending $24 on three tacos I have to stop somewhere else to get something to eat so I don't pass out from hunger by 2:00, we have a problem. Our waitress ignored us, and we had to ask for every single drink refill we got. \n\nI was ready to boycott the place for life, but my coworker is a more kind and forgiving soul than I am (or a glutton for punishment), so we went back for breakfast a couple of days later. We each ordered an omelet. My coworker asked for no guacamole on his....and they messed up his order.....again. I ordered a denver omelet and washed it down with some of the worst coffee of my life (which was $4...yes, for a cup of black coffee.....yes, you read that right). \n\nMy coworker bought both of these meals, and I can't say I would ever come back, even if the food was being paid for by someone else. I am giving the place two stars because the decor inside is nice and the fish tacos (all six bites of 'em) were tasty. Otherwise, this place would be a solid one star."

I had a panini and one of their juices. The panini was okay. Just okay. The juice was pretty good. \n\nIt did take them a while to make our food.  \n\nThe seating was also unclear. There was a section of the restaurant blocked off, which I could only assume was for the sit down restaurant part. There was also another area which wasn't labeled and kinda separated from the rest of the place. The only obvious seating for the cafe was outside the restaurant on the \"patio\" (and b \"patio,\" I mean the air conditioned hallway of Mandalay Bay) and even half of that was blocked off presumably for the sit down restaurant. Some signs so customers don't get confused would be nice."

So I just came here with a friend just to watch a show and we had plenty of time to kill. The bottomless mimosas were absolutely amazing. The bartender Lizzy was so nice and genuine and had the most funniest conversations with us ever. Also Glen who is a waiter there is great as well. These people have amazing customer service and made me and my friend have nothing but an amazing experience full of laughter and fun with these people. They are so wonderful at customer interaction and multitasking. If you are going to go to the bar, I would put in a request for Lizzy. If you are looking for a sit down, Glen is great too. In my personal opinion, this place is the best for a breakfast, brunch, and lunch. I would definitely come back here again. Atmospheres great and so are the employees. Thank you Lizzy and Glen for an amazing experience, I will see you guys soon!"

Our server was so excited at first to greet us because we had a party of 6. He thought we were going to be a high value table, but his demeanor all changed when we told him we were only ordering a couple orders of those crispy piping hot waffle fries and the wonderful delectable sliders along with only waters. We only saw him once more after he brought us our food. I thought it was rude of our waiter to treat us differently only because we weren't spending as much $$$ as most tables would. It was am, we just wanted some snacks!\n\nDespite the service snafu, the appetizers (sliders and waffle fries) were quite good. Even though we didn't order any main entrees, everything was reasonable priced. I will definitely come back to Citizens Kitchen & Bar to give their entrees a try!"

After long night of dancing at Light nightclub, Citizens was a few steps away.  Got seated relatively fast and we quickly ordered off the one page menu.  Our party of four ordered quite a few items to share and all was quite good.  \nThe Prime rib was AWESOME!  Highly recommended.  \nThe Mahi mahi fish taco was ok and had a spicy kick in it. \nThe Cheese dip chips was amazing!  The dipping of cheese and chili was perfect filling for the late night cravings.\nThe Buffalo wings were ok.  It was a bit acidic for a late night food but the taste was still good.\n\nServer was really busy and the whole place was understaffed.  On a Saturday night, one large section was held down by only one server.  He seemed very collected but I can tell, he was a little overwhelmed with the requests from each table.  We didn't bother him much but there was a tables that had many requests every time he walks by- not sure if the server forgot and had to be reminded or it was simply the patrons asking for different stuff each time.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back again especially for the prime rib and the cheese dip chips."

The chips were a mixed bag of tortilla chips and pita chips.  The problem were some chips were soggy and stale tasting and some were crisp and fresh. The pita was mostly hard with a few soft bites.  The dip itself was lacking in flavor but tasted ok.  \n\nFor our meal, at the server's suggestion we split an entree due to large portion size.   To our delight, the split entree was brought on two separate plates.  Some establishments do not separate it for you and I thought that was a nice touch.\n\nHowever the blue cheese burger was quite disappointing.  The bun was boring, the burger dry and over cooked, and the blue cheese had no distinguishable flavor from a goat cheese.   The mac and cheese with hamhock also lacked any identifiable cheese flavor with only a light hint of a mild cheddar.  The side of fries were soggy matchstick size fries.\n\nI expected more from an establishment in the Mandalay Bay.\n\nThere are a few interesting menu items but when we asked about them, the server hesitated to recommend them.\n\nThey do have a hangover brunch with $25 bottomless mimosas.\nThey also have a 24 burgers in 24 minutes challenge for $40.00 unless you eat them all and then it is free.  \n\nI can't imagine I will be back unless it is just to sample a dessert."

The waiter was not the most friendly person, but was polite.  We placed our order, pancakes and eggs for my hubby and I got a Denver Omlette both with hash-browns and we split a side of bacon.  Tim comes by twice in the next 30 minutes to apologize for the order taking so long.  When it finally comes out, everything is cold. I'm diabetic and my blood sugar is so low that I HAVE to eat.  So, we ate it.  I don't mean it wasn't hot.  I mean the little balls of butter wouldn't melt on anything.  Not my hubby's pancakes, not my toast, not the hash-browns!  Also, know how I am when I was hungry so I didn't say anything, not that I was even asked how things were. Tim ignored us until he brought the check.  So, I waited two weeks to post this, cuz when I think about it I'm still mad.  Go ANYWHERE else!!"

My only complaint would be a lighter side like fruit as an option. But the sandwich was flavorful, the au jus delicious and really a great meal. I'd recommend asking for horseradish on the side for an extra kick but either way it's good."

He took a great photo of the group next to us without hesitation!  \nThe French Onion Soup we split was excellent, very cheesy, and large portions...even split between the two of us.  I had a Tommykbocker Butthead Boch, and my GF had the Midori sour, both excellent even if the sour is a bit overpriced.  We then split the NY steak and it was very juicy, and well cooked to our medium order.  Came with fries on the plate, and if it wasn't juicy enough, the A-1 butter was really good.  A really good meal on the Strip for a high-priced seventy bucks, given the atmosphere, but not as pricy as other places in the Mandalay Bay.\nWell recommended, and we split on whether we would come back again.  We like variety, after all...."

Pricey, but I was happy for some fresh veggies!\nThe sit-down side got me through breakfast with a tasty CA omelette. I got the eggs fried (and requested them cooked in butter not oil) with avocado, sour cream and pico de gallo on top. A little pile of tatertot hash came with. Was it mind blowing? No. Was it tasty, fresh and satisfying? You bet. The hash was \"meh\" but I could see folks liking it for that salty kick back to grade school. \nCoffee (iced americano w/soy) was quite good. \nService was attentive and friendly, no complaints. \nAll in all I am grateful this place is here and will gladly come back knowing I can get a fresh tasty meal. Expensive? No more so than the rest of Vegas.\nThanks, Citizens! (I'd actually give them 3.5 stars, 4 if the menu were a little more inspired, but all in all the food is reliable, good, and fresh.)"

A bottle of water was $5 - bringing our small-ish lunch to share to $40.  We thought we'd give it another try the following day, it was better - the food may have been restocked overnight, not sure, but sandwich was great, fruit was fresher, water was still $5 - and total was $43 again, but better experience over all.  Ate out on the patio outside, not served, may be a different experience - overall great when on the go in Vegas, just a little pricey for a sandwich and salad."

            "review": "First time here. As a Vegas local, I usually try to avoid the Strip places, as from what I've seen they're usually overpriced tourist traps. I'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised by Citizens. I had been considering Citizens as an after-concert choice (Neil Diamond!), since it's open 24 hours. We arrived at Mandalay Bay early and had an hour and a half to kill, so we decided to eat before the show instead.\n\nAfter checking out the menu board outside and getting on the list, we waited about 3 minutes and we were seated in the outer \"patio\" area. Our server, Nick, greeted us very shortly thereafter and brought us our drinks, offering to answer any questions we had about the menu sections. I decided against spending $40 on a 14 oz NY sirloin steak and went with the bacon burger (medium done, add cheese, hold the onions) & fries. My wife chose the NY-style pastrami sandwich. Being that it was 5:45 pm, I expected to wait a bit for my order to come out. After 15 minutes or so Nick came back to the table and apologized for the wait, explaining that they were very busy and that he would see to our orders ASAP. I thought that was really cool of him, because I cannot tell how many times I have been sitting in a restaurant, getting aggravated looking at my watch over and over, while the wait staff hangs around chatting or walks by us over and over like we haven't been sitting there sipping our drinks for over a half hour. The food arrived a few minutes later and it was time to dig in.\n\nMy burger platter, served on what looked like a cookie sheet, was the perfect size for the $20 price tag: a good-size, nicely stacked burger with tomato and shredded lettuce, cooked and prepared exactly as I had requested and skewered through the top bun with a large pepperoncini that would make Papa John cry, a decently-sized \"bucket\" of shoestring fries and a half pickle slice. My wife's equally-priced sandwich was huge (the half she couldn't finish wound up in the car in a to-go box before we went to the show), stuffed with perfectly lean pastrami, along with a side bowl of potato salad (or fries or cole slaw) and also sporting that pepperoncini and pickle slice. Both orders were delicious and appropriately priced for the portions we received. When it came time to settle the bill, I jokingly asked if they do employee discounts for fellow MGM employees, to which Nick said he would go check. He returned a couple of minutes later with, to my surprise, a new bill reflecting a 20% discount (which I kicked back to Nick on top of the original tip for his great service) - a definite high-five to Citizens for that!\n\nAll in all, I still generally think Strip dining establishments are tourist traps, but I also think they have not yet seen the last of me at Citizens - it seemed to be, at least to me, one of the few exceptions to the rule."

I was told that we should get there before 7 am to ensure that we get a table - and we did.   It was not crowded at 6:45 am.   \n\nI was there for 2 consecutive mornings for my breakfast business meetings and my server remembered me on the 2nd day.   Perhaps my tipping made an impression?  (Not sure if that was good or bad).   The service was okay but my second serving of cappuccino took over 10 mins to get to me.\n\nI had my custom omelette both mornings but due my focus on the business interactions, I actually didn't remember if the food were good or bad!   :-).   \n\nI like the casual setting and the atmosphere that could facilitate a discussion."

I only went here a second time (on a separate Vegas trip) because my group was starved and drunk... and couldn't walk another hundred feet to another restaurant or something ridiculous....  I can't remember.\n\nBUT I CAN REMEMBER HOW SHITTY BOTH MY VISITS HERE WERE!\nThe first time, I ordered a pretty basic burger that ended up coming to the table late and undercooked.  While I would typically eat it if it was anything else (my standards of food are pretty low), I would probably have yakked it out if I decided to eat it.  I asked for it to be recooked, but the waiter was pretty unresponsive about me getting a new one, so I didn't even end up eating it as my group was in a rush.  I gave up and decided to never come back again....\n\nBut I did, several months later.  This time, our group was much bigger (about 10) so understandably, it would take a while to get our food.  However, we were there for maybe a half hour-45 AFTER ordering and our waitress passed by our table once, only after we all spent time staring at her from across the room.  Finally got the food and it was cold as Antarctica.  Wow! It's like they cooked it on time but left it on the counter to hang out or something.  Some people at my table refused to eat most of their food so I asked (shamelessly) if they \"were gonna eat that\" so I could doggy bag it.  Even the boxes took some effort to acquire.  I was determined to salvage as much as I could from this experience and never return again!  \n\nOh, 24 hr Vegas McDonald's.  I will never forsake you again."

However, Sat morning 3/5/16 my fiance and I went to Citizen for breakfast after grabbing a cup of Java at Starbucks.  As we approached the young blonde woman who was the hostess, I immediately saw the sour look on her face.  She was leaning on her elbow and was either in a bad mood or had a terrible hangover. I stood by and waited for her to look my way so I could make my request.  Mind you there was only one other guy waiting to get in. After waiting a minute with no acknowledgement,  I walked all the way up to her, and said excuse me, but we'd like to have breakfast.  She looked at me like I kicked her buns, then said just two of you?.  I said yes, and thank you. She said sternly, stand close!  I shrugged her attitude off and we checked out the posted breakfast menu.  Then she smugly told us,\" I'm sorry, but no outside drinks are allowed you'll have to throw it away\". That was before she even planned on seating us. At that point I told her to forget it, and we would go elsewhere.\nRound 2... We returned for dinner, and it was like night n day.  The young brunette woman greeted us warmly, and sat us within 10 mins.  The waitress was excellent as was the food. \nI'm giving this a 3 star but would give it 5 had that first employee not ruined my morning .. Management should do random attitude checks to improve their customer's experience. Their Mac n cheese and mahi tacos were outstanding."

This place is set up like a diner but the menu items have high-end prices. Any entr\u00e9e cost anywhere from between $40-$60. It's located conveniently next to the club Light so you go at 4AM you will see a lot of drunk, post-clubbers (like me). \n\nI ordered a filet mignon and fries which was around $58 (another high/low thing). The steak fries were delicious! Nothing better than some comfort food after drinking! The filet mignon was very tender and juicy too, but for some reason I filled up on the fries. I found it a bit hilarious that the filet mignon came with fries instead of mashed potatoes or creamed corn like traditional steakhouses, but, hey, that's Vegas for ya. \n\nOverall the environment of the restaurant was not that memorable, but the food was pretty decent. I did find it rather funny that this place looked so casual but the menu items would be something that an upscale (okay, at least business casual) restaurant would serve. I would probably end up here again if I went to Light, but not something I would go out of my way for. Plus, it's also rather pricey considering what you get, but that's Vegas *shrugs*.\n\nThe service was pretty good too. I don't have any memorable stories, but my other friends actually came here as well and saw me eating with someone and told the waitress that they were going to leave because they saw someone they knew. The waitress replied, \"Don't worry, I'll hide you.\"  That's top notch service right there!\n\nYelp should really do half stars. I would give this place 3.5 stars but I rounded down to 3 because I was less than impressed with the decor."

I ordered a small Caesar salad for a starter.  For the main, he recommended the fish tacos and I went with that.  For dessert, I again took his recommendation and ordered the carrot cake.  It was good following his advice!\n\nThe Cesar salad was a normal one, nothing special.  They could have left the hard piece of bread with baked cheese on it.  The bread was indeed hard and there was no cheese flavor.  It looked better than it tasted.\n\nI have only gotten fish tacos once before so this was almost a new entr\u00e9e for me.  The tacos were filled to the brim.  The mahi mahi was tasty, there was some slaw, and each taco had a slice of avocado along with some chipotle aioli.  There were three side containers of sour cream, guacamole, and pico.  The tacos were juicy and messy eating, but worth it.  \n\nThe carrot cake was a gigantic slice of goodness.  It was rich cake with a good cream cheese icing and nuts sprinkled liberally on the icing.\n\nYou are paying Strip prices for tacos you could get from a street vendor for much less.  The restaurant was almost empty and the quiet was enjoyable.  Tony was a great server and I'm glad I gave Citizens a try."

The concept is open with indoor and \"outdoor\" (walking area of hotel)seating as well as to-go options. Aesthetics could be described as a classy American diner.\n\nWhen my coworker and I landed at night, we were starving and quickly decided on Citizens. I went for the French Onion Soup and a side of the Mac and Cheese. Be warned! The French Onion Soup is not meant to be an appetizer. It comes in a very large bowl and was a meal in and of itself-I'm sad to say much of it was wasted, as delicious as it was. The mac and cheese was also quite good. I also had a glass of red wine-which also came in a huge glass. Ok wine, but not worth the price tag. \n\nDays later, when my husband and I were enjoying the pool, we were looking for food options and decided on Citizens for take out by the pool. We opted for the chicken and cheese quesadillas which came with sides of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo.

Towering high, barely held together by a skewer, this rapidly fell apart and more napkins gave their lives here than for any other meal in Vegas.

The space is huge, and comprised of all hard surfaces; hard floors, hard ceilings, and hard walls. What this equates to is an extremely loud dining experience, even if it's not that full. The vaulted ceilings, light fixtures and finishes are all cool, but this place is just huge. I would also point out that if you want comfort, do not sit on the incorrectly proportioned backless bar chairs at the bar, and instead get yourself a table.  More importantly this place is overpriced; you'll notice that just about everything on the menu is about $2-3 more than you'd be willing to spend. I had this gripe when I ate at Mandalay's noodle shop a few weeks ago when my lunch special was an astonishing $18 for a soup and lunch-portioned dish. Apparently the property really likes to take advantage of their massive convention crowds. With everything from breakfasts, salads, burgers, entrees and desserts you can certainly find something you'd like, just expect to pay handsomely for it. Also, they use the words 'specialty' and 'signature' quite a bit on their menu, but looking around at other people's dishes and based on my meal this definition seems to be based around providing mediocre, high priced sandwiches.\n\nMy classic hamburger was placed in front of me and looked as mediocre as it tasted. The bun was dry and a bit too big, but well-proportioned to the patty. Not sure if you have a choice of cheeses, but when I asked for a cheeseburger I wasn't offered any options and was given American cheese. The presumably frozen patty had ok char flavor, but was of your extremely generic back yard BBQ variety, and very overcooked at that. But I guess one of this quality shouldn't be ordered any other way. One small slice of not too fresh tomato didn't provide much coverage, but I had plenty of pickles, lettuce and red onion at my disposal. Overall this had nothing great going on. \n\nMy waffle fries sucked as they always do, and considering the menu gives you the option of skinny fries, potato salad or coleslaw I'm not quite sure why I got these stupid fries. They're clearly never fresh due to how they're made, so why bother? Plus, $21 for a burger and iced tea is about $9 more than you should pay for this, even in a casino setting capitalizing on desperate conventioneers. After this awful experience, combined with Burger Bar's drop off, I can probably now claim that there are no decent burger options south of Tropicana along the Strip until you get much more south away from the casinos. If you're at Mandalay I would still recommend Burger Bar over this as you get far better quality for the money, but I can't promise anything there anymore."

Kale and brown rice salad with grilled chicken\n2. Quinoa vegetable Salad with grilled Salmon\n\nYummy....Huge portion, tasty and fresh. I was fully satisfied with our selections. \n\nIt's open 24 hours!! It's pretty awesome when your in Vegas knowing you'll be up all night and hungry at any time.\nYou can either sit and be served or order and pick up...but if you order and pick up, you must eat out on the patio of the restaurant."

I called them at 5 AM asking about the menu options at that hour and they said that the to go part was open and what I wanted to order was available when I told her. Once I got there and made my order(Turkey avocado sandwich), they said they were out of the cranberry walnut bread it's normally served on, which is part of why I wanted to go there to try it and they should've told me that on the phone. Whatever, I got it on sourdough instead. Then I ordered a chicken Caesar salad, the chicken soup and the green mean juice shake. They said that they wouldn't serve me the soup because it had been sitting there all day..... Ok then why have it on a late night menu if you're not going to serve it? \n\nOnce I got home I realize there was no avocado in my turkey avocado sandwich...again annoying...to pay for something I didn't get and not wanting to drive all the way back for it. Anyways, the food still tasted good and I could tell was fresh. \n\nMy bill was $35 for a salad, sandwich and drink.....pretty pricy but I don't mind paying to bad because the quality was good. I will definitely come back here to try it again. Hopefully this next time I'll have a better experience and can give it more stars."

She said \"That time was an estimation and as soon as the \"right\" table opens we will be sat\". I said ok.. 5 mins later we had a table. Now mind you the surrounding 4 tables were empty too. We sat there for at least 10 minutes  before anyone even came over. We ordered drinks, I a soda, my nephews soda and the last a water no lemon. When guy finally brought the drinks he brought water with lemon. My mom is allergic so we asked if he would just change it out. He had the worst attitude and when he came back\nhe tossed the water on the table.This was completely offensive. I located the manager and asked or another server. The new server was nice but extremely slow. The surrounding tables all got their food long before we did. It was just not a fun experience. We will never, ever be back!"

            "review": "Yes, we went on their opening day but still, 2 hours for a lunch that consisted of a couple of sandwiches and a salad is completely unacceptable.  Since this place was Red, White and Blue like 5 minutes ago, I'm 99% sure they just re-branded the place and didn't replace their entire staff.  Of course, I could be completely wrong about that.  Even so, for a restaurant that was less than half full, they should have it together enough to throw some sandwiches on a plate.\n\nOn the bright side, our server was nice and always had our drinks refilled.  The food, once we got it, was decent.  My Greek salad was huge, although, I'm not sure it was Greek so much as an Italian chopped salad like the kind you'd get at your favorite pizza joint.  The salmon that I ordered with it was, despite being heavily over seasoned, cooked very well and pretty good.  The portions are huge but for the $32 I spent on a salad and an iced tea, I still think it's pretty steep, although probably on par with the rest of the hotel outlets.\n\nIt does look like they've put some thought and effort into their beverage program, which I appreciate.  I've been dying to try the new Bombay Sapphire East, which they have here and nowhere else that I've seen in the hotel.  They've also come up with a cocktail menu that looks like they've tried to put twists on some of what seem to be Vegas' most popular drinks.  If I hadn't been working, I would have given them a go.\n\nHonestly, I probably won't ever come back for lunch because I will most likely be fired for being gone so long again.  Since I basically live at the Mandalay Bay for work, I'm sure I'll be back at some point.  Hopefully with a lot of time on my hands."

The server was very friendly, took our order right away and frequently came back to check on our table.

I know it's a simple dish, but you can tell a huge difference between the sandwich here and a $5.99 melt somewhere else. The tuna had great quality while the bread and cheese were grilled to perfection. I love the crunchy softness.\nMy friend ordered the French Dip Steak which was very good as well.\n\nThis place is well-worth coming back to if it was comp'd again! haha\nBut I'd probably just stick to a cheaper cafe or grill if I were craving a sandwich."

I mentioned to the waitress that my eggs were suppose to be runny and dripping yolk over my toast and all she could do was apologize. The manager on shift was snooty when she came over to our table.

The cole slaw side was ok, but probably should've gone with the fries.\n-$18 Bacon cheeseburger. Three slices of fine bacon makes for a tasty cheeseburger and the fries were served hot and crispy.

Don't do it. Interestingly, the $2 side of toast is worth it: two slices so large they are a breakfast in themselves. My regular way to start the day at a Vegas trade show at Mandalay is with the chocolate peanut butter smoothie ($9) and that side of toast ($2). For $11, it's a great starter to an intense day on your feet. \n\nAnd speaking of being on your feet, the floors in Mandalay leading into Citizens are crazy slippery. I'm shocked people aren't breaking their hips on a regular basis. I ate at Citizens twice this week while in town for the Project trade show and nearly fell over another guest waiting in line for a table. \n\nThe service at Citizens definitely makes up for the overpriced menu.

Not the healthiest of meals but we were all hungry and looking forward to a quiet place to sit and catch up.  My husband is a fast eater and got through his food fast and within 1/2 an hour, was in the bathroom.  We left earlier then planned as he was not feeling well.  My friend managed to get back to her room before her stomach started bothering her and I made it home.  All night & morning, we all had diahhrea and stomach issues.  I called them in the morning and asked to speak to a manager to let them know what happened so maybe others wouldn't get sick.  I got a snotty, arogant manager who told me they hadn't had any other complaints and since we didn't all eat the same food, it couldn't possibly be food poisoning.  I told her we all had something fried so maybe there was an issue with their fryers and they should look into it.  She said OK - and hung up on me.  What great customer service!  \n\nWe spend $70 on 2 meals & 2 sodas and ended up sick as dogs and we basically got - nope, didn't happen, don't care - see you.  Mind you I know their mentality - these people won't be back and we won't have to worry about it again although I did start the conversation letting her know we were locals but that didn't even seem to matter - and it shouldn't - bad food or service should not be for anyone, local or tourists.  But we will definately not be going there again and I will let everyone know what happened so they don't have to experience it themselves.  All of this could have been resolved with a little bit of compasion - it wasn't like I was asking for a free meal or anything - just for them to acknowledge and do something so no one else would get sick.  It might have been a one off but I won't recommend it to anyone - if management doesn't care, why should their employees?"

Well there was no problem! Only problem was ROXANNE at CITZiZENS! \nThankfully Ashley at MLife applied the discount over the phone so I wouldn't have to stand in line.

If you are on the Strip, you're going to pay twice any amount for that sandwich. Get over it. I ordered the tarragon chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the turkey and avocado on wheat instead of whichever roll they had listed on the menu. The staff was happy to accommodate to our requests and were more than friendly. My sandwich was out of this world delicious. The bread was so surprisingly delightful. Crusty, but with a soft pillowy center. One sandwich was nearly more than enough for me. The boyfriend and I usually order two things and trade halves. His turkey/avocado sandwich was exactly what he was looking for and made to satisfaction. It wasn't anything that lifted my eyebrows but there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. All good here if you're just looking for a quick sandwich."

They had their menu on the outside and I saw they had a lobster roll. That is all I needed. So I went to the hostess and got seated. I was told a server would be by shortly. Um not what happened. Now the place was virtually empty and I noticed my server had looked over and saw me sitting there waiting but he never came up and offered me a drink or anything. He just kept staring at me and carried on conversations with his co workers. It made me very uncomfortable. Then he finally comes up and asks me if I am ready. He offers no apology for the wait or the fact that he saw me sitting there and did nothing. He did not ask me if I wanted a drink or anything like servers normally ask first he just asked me if I was ready and had a huge attitude when he asked. The annoying tone in his voice was like I had kept him waiting while I stared at the menu forever or something like that. His attitude surprised me considering I knew what I wanted from the second I walked in and I was the one who was kept waiting but ok. I also wanted to get to the Shark Reef aquarium before I started collecting my social security so if anyone should've been annoyed it should have been me. I ordered my food and guess what more waiting. Again he was too busy doing his own thing to go check on my food. It took almost 30 minutes to get my food. I know it was not the kitchen for one thing the lobster is served cold so is not like they have to cook the lobster and heat it up or anything and my side was coleslaw. How long does that take? I had already thought it was a mistake coming there because my server acted like a complete asshole but it was even worse after I tried this pitiful excuse for a lobster roll. It was disgusting. After I picked through my food I waited and waited for the server to bring me my check. I had to flag him down at some point because if not I would have sat there forever. Well wanting my check must have been a problem because Mr. Attitude acted even more stuck up when I flagged him down and asked for my check. Needless to say after $23 for that lunch I felt leaving unsatisfied and downright stupid for wasting my time and money there. The food was shitty and the customer service was even shittier. others many have a better experience but personally for me I will not ever waste my time and energy here again. Mandalay Bay and Vegas itself has WAY too many superior options for dining for me to waste me time where I am clearly not wanted."

These nachos definitely hit the late night craving. There is plenty of nachos to share, and we even had some left at the end as they do get heavy with the cheese whiz on it. Most of the nachos retained their crispyness and crunch, except for the bunch on the bottom that were smothered in the cheese whiz. While at Citizens I did see giant and I mean giant pieces of cake that I will want to try on my next trip to Las Vegas."

Never have I had such terrible service but what makes it worst is that it was from multiple people (including the manager) WOW!! Only reason this place has 2 stars and not 1 is becasue it is located in a cool hotel. No way no how will not ever stop by at this place again. Incredibly rude and unhelpful people. I was appalled at the way the manager or supervisor lady we spoke to runs this place. We walked by on the weekend of my birthday before heading back to LA around 11:30am on a Sunday and was told by the hostess that they were currently not seating anyone and to check back in about 20 minutes. We tried to ask if we can just sit at a table and have a drink but again she was persistant with more or less the same answer but in a much more rude way.  So we took a walk around Mandalay for a bit then upon our return around 12 we were told the same thing. At this point we were a bit frustrated and mad so we asked to speak to their manager. The lady came out and explained to us that they were changing cooks so could not seat anyone. But not only that in a very rude and snarky type of way, almost as if speaking and explainng was painful. We just wanted to sit out by the patio area and have a few drinks and people watch. But apperantly thats way to much to ask for these people. We finally ended up getting a table after somewhat of a heated confrontation from the bitter clueless manager. We had a few drinks and bought a few bread items/pastries from inside but could definitely feel the unpleasent welcome. How difficult is it to say sorry the kitchen is currently closed but if you wish to sit outside and enjoy some drinks go ahead. I mean geez it is freaking VEGAS how can you deny people drinks, she was very clear and did not want to let us sit in the patio table area she said we could sit at the bar but I guess customer service and making money is not exactly their first priority here... If I were the owner or person in charge I would seriously think about training the employees better. I know the hostess was just following directions but one would expect a person such as the female manager/supervisor to be a bit more competent with customer service as apposed to chasing money away. Will definitley tell everyone I know that is going to Vegas (specificly Mandalay Bay) to avoid this place like the plague."

That was way more than I was expecting to get but for the cost of $9, it def was a humongous heavy piece of late night cake. Was it worth $9 bucks?? Most likely not. It was moist and it was delicious but for a slice of cake, it was a little dent in my pocket for it. That cake served me as a snack and a part of my breakfast in the morning of the next day. As for the drink, it was good but also $9! The serving size for that was actually small, not worth the $9 even though the flavors were great. Peanut butter and dark chocolate flavors blended with bananas, soy and flax seeds. Tasty food but way too over priced. I get that we are in Vegas but for that price and the longggg wait for just my two items,  I am sure I can still find something  with more bang for my buck."

Pair that with the relatively high prices ($9 breakfast burrito, $9 smoothies, etc) and it's not a particularly high value proposition. \n\nThe smoothie I got was the \"Green...\" something? I can't remember. But it had Kale and Avocado in it, and wasn't bad. My stomach wasn't feeling to great from a heavy dinner the night before, and it had a soothing effect. However it wan't the best kale smoothy I've had, and was probably the most expensive I've ever had at $9, so ehhh... \n\nThe breakfast burrito wasn't particularly good, but it was hearty and satisfying. They are pre-made in the morning, so you can't change anything about them. And while they are pre-made they need to be grilled to order, so they take quite some time. The worst of both worlds overall, but still was the best option for a relatively quick and hearty breakfast in the morning. \n\nStill, we stopped by here almost every morning that we were staying at Mandalay bay for a business conference, as there really wasn't much competition for quick morning eats in the vicinity. \n\nI would likely stop by and get food here if I was attending morning conference sessions at the Mandalay Bay conference center again, but probably not outside of that circumstance."

We walked in and got seated, the server had problems taking our orders and since he thought he could remember everything without writing it down he then brought out some of the food wrong. It took them 30-35minutes to bring out the food. No one wants to wait that long for food at 2am. Five out of  six people ordered the same food and it was the Burger and let me tell you that the vacation ended right there! Every single person had the worst stomach pain and you can imagine the rest!  I asked for a refund  the following day,  the managers told me that I should send an email with my experience so they could look it over, Nick one of the managers actually tried to help and he told us that they were very embarrassed over this and would do anything to fix it so he asked for the receipt and that he would refund the money, until today I only received $45 out of almost $180, they couldn't even track our bill and refund the rest being that they have an advanced POS system. It took them 3 weeks to refund the $45 while I had to text and call everyday.  Two of the five  people that had food poisoning  actually went to the doctors the day after and were told that it was 100% food poisoning.

We then asked for everything to get packaged to go so we could sit outside as they demanded. \n\nThe sandwiches themselves are decently sized but nothing special at all. Does it warrant a $13 price tag? HELL NO! I wish I could ask for our money back because this place left such a sour taste in our mouths. I got the Turkey, avocado, and sprouts sandwich. The ingredients are fresh seeming enough, but seriously nothing to write home about. My bf got the Reuben, which poorly assembled and just messy. This was the worst spent $40 of our lives. I don't know how anyone else gives this place more than 3 stars (and even that is too generous). We are paying customers, we should be treated with respect, not whatever they say is passing for service here."

It all started out alright, service was okay, server was nice enough. We came in and we're almost the only ones there.. As we sat they got busier and busier and that's when our service got worse and worse. Our food came and it was very bland, drinks very dry, and the service getting worse and worse. We would get the occasional how is everything, how are you guys doing followed by a dash off, not even to stop and hear the response to his question. My brother ordered a drink, to which he got a response that they don't have that drink, this was not the case. The actual waiter didn't know that they even had this drink on the menu.. Very disappointing service, very bland and tasteless food.. Definitely wouldn't recommend it if your here in Las Vegas.."

The waitress was nice at first. She tended to us, answered all our questions, and took our order. It took a long while to get our food, but we didn't want to make a big deal because the Olympian Soccer player, Mia Hamm was sitting right next to us. \n\nI ordered the Mac and Cheese which the cheese was so runny, it looked like clam chowder. The cheese wasn't orange, but it was white. I also had the Smothered Tator Tots which was good. My fiance had the Tuna Melt and Corn on the Cob, He enjoyed the corn, but said he had better Tuna Melts. \n\nAfter we got our food, we noticed the waitress so involved with Mia Hamm and her guest. We finally made eye contact and asked for our bill. When I gave her my credit card, the waitress came back with my reciepts to be signed. I was writing a tip and calculating my total when the waitress came back. She apologized and said she accidentally put Mia Hamm's table on my credit card. She said, since they didn't close the bill, my credit card will not be charged. WRONG! I went on my bank statement that day and I seen two charges for Citizen's. One charge finally dropped off two days later. \n\nI wouldn't come back again. There food is ridicously over priced for what it is. There are a ton of other great restaurants in Vegas."

They have pastries , salads , coffees .\n\nI ordered a Cobb salad to go which cost about $11. It had lettuce , cubes of Swiss cheese , bacon , eggs , scallions , tomatoes . It was a decent size and the nice cashier gave me an extra ranch dressing for free . The salad looked a bit messy compared to the other ones I saw in display case but it tasted pretty good nonetheless .\n\nThe caffe latte was $5 and made to order . It was a delicious hot coffee that was made well .\n\nI'd stop by again to try out breakfast items if I stay in this hotel again ."

She helped us navigate through the menu and recommended her favorite bottle of of wine. It was spot on!! We then asked her to get us some munchies and said we trusted her. She got us some calamari, artichoke dip and potato skins. AGAIN SPOT ON!! They were all delish. She finished us off with a carrot cake to share ( it's HUGE) and some coffee. After chitchatting and winding down for abt 2 HOURS, we were all refreshed and left to walk some more. Great food and awesome service. Thanks for awesome experience to citizens and Lotus! I will definitely be back :)"

We were greeted promptly at the hostess stand and were offered the choice of inside or patio seating. We love people watching, so we took a seat on the patio. We were quickly greeted by our server, Art, who was kind enough to take our beer and mixed drink order, brought us some waters and recommended a few appetizers.  We decided on the Spinach Dip. It arrived quickly and piping hot.  There were multiple different cheeses, an abundance of fresh tasting spinach and they had enough chips where we didn't have to worry about running out of chips with a lot of dip left (a huge pet peeve of ours). We would go out of our way to order this again.\n\nOur dinner entrees were delicious and promptly served after our appetizer was completed. Everything was hot and tasted fresh. The manager, Andrea, even stopped by and not only asked about how our meal was, but asked us about how we were enjoying our time in Vegas and gave us a couple additional ideas of things to do. That was a nice touch. Great food, great service, we will definitely go there again next time we are in town."

But before I could take a bite, the waitress that I had waved to was at my table asking if I needed anything.  Dang, she wasn't even my waitress but she dropped what she was doing and hustled over to see what she could do for me.  \n\nThat's just one example.  I could cite more.   All the waitstaff are like that.  Efficient, accommodating and super friendly. \n\nThis wasn't our first visit.  We've been eating here since the restaurant was called Red, White and Blue.  The name changed, but the food is still great, and the service is exemplary.\n\nThe food is a little more expensive here than the coffee shop.  Breakfasts are $17-$20.  I always get the Eggs Benedict, which is always prepared perfectly.  The Hollandaise has a subtle herb flavor that sets it apart from the typical version.  The breakfast potatoes are simple, yet delicious.  If you order anything with breakfast potatoes be sure to get a side of their sausage gravy.  It's outstanding and absolutely loaded with sausage.\n\nMy wife typically gets some sort of fresh fruit bowl.   I can verify the berries were fresh and delicious.  My nephew had the french toast, which comes topped with those same fresh berries, and it looked really good.  \n\nThey serve Lavazza for their house coffee here.  They use it for their espresso beverages, too.  Good stuff!\n\nMikey C says: Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite yo!"

When that's the aggregate rating out of hundreds of reviews, for me personally I begin to think the establishment might be shitty.   Especially when there is a sprinkling of reviews that are at 1 star with all kinds of jacked up things being written.  \"3\" may be \"A-OK\" according to Yelp, to me it means the place is questionable.  \n\nSo if you don't want to fuck around with Citizens and risk disappointment, here's my advice:  Go to the the takeout counter and order either the Reuben or else the turkey avocado sandwich.  Simple as that.    \n\nThese sandwiches are so good.   The ingredients, the breads, the thinly-sliced soft and moist deli meat... Adds up to an amazing sandwich that I go out of my way for.   Trust me.   \n\nYes, these sandwiches are expensive.   Around $15 for one sandwich to give you some idea.    But damn worth it, and I keep going back for it.  For the times I drive in to Vegas from So Cal, I typically order extra sandwiches to go as a snack later on.   \n\nBut if the price still seems completely outrageous to you, I won't fault you.  Just do it if you're comfortable.   However, to put it in perspective, what did cost you to get a bottle of Grey Goose last night at Hakkasan?   Or even one cocktail at Light... How much did that cost?  How much money did you put out in the casino?   What did you spend on the stripper with your buddies?\n\nExactly.      So shut the hell up and get one of the best sandwiches you'll ever eat!!!"

It wasn't hugely busy, but our waiter did have several tables concurrently and I can forgive that oversight. He was still friendly and courteous. It's service that sets most any restaurant on the Strip apart, since the food is usually pretty decent but often over-priced.\nThe food was quite good; I had the double burger that's on two grilled cheese sandwiches, which is to say that my fiance wondered whether we'd make it to the show or not when the ambulance was called. I survived by some miracle, and came out of it with a smile on my face and half the burger in a to-go box so that I could finish killing myself later after NASA got back to me with the calorie count calculation for the thing.\nOverall, I'd probably come back here; it was a pretty friendly little place and you got a decent amount of food for the money. Yes, the prices are higher than an off-strip restaurant, but the portions are still good."

First of all, if you opt to dine in for dinner, at least the couple of times that I've gone (Sunday after 10pm), it gets really LOUD because of the band that plays just across the way.  Sometimes you just want to wind down with some good conversation, but you can't really do that with the extremely loud music playing.  If you have a headache, forget about coming here!  When we went back recently, we opted to just take our food to go.  Anyway, I like a cozy ambiance or a place with a trendy/sexy vibe; Citizens has neither.  So no problem not dining in that time.\n\nOn both of my visits, service was meh.  The hostess the time we dined in started to seat us out on their patio area closest to the live band. When we requested a quieter table inside, she sat us at a table right next to the patio making little difference in the noise level :/  There's definitely no service with a smile at Citizens, at least from my experience.\n\nAs for the food, I definitely wasn't impressed on my first visit.  I wasn't too hungry, so I opted for their french onion soup and got to taste my dining companion's penne prosciutto.  Again, meh.  Even though we weren't impressed on that visit, we went back to Citizens on a recent trip to Vegas since we were staying at the Four Seasons next door and our options were limited for late night dining.  We ordered at their to-go counter, and I chose their cheese quesadilla this time and their salted caramel parfait.  Their quesadilla I didn't care for but I did like the parfait.  I ended up coming back a few days later to pick up a blondie.  It had some toffee in it and was tasty overall and it did not disappoint!  (I forgot to take pics of the food I picked up to go.)\n\nOverall, I would recommend Citizens for their treats at the to-go counter, or if it's late and you're not in the mood for fast food and there are no other options nearby.  Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to have a meal here."

My wife usually goes for the eggs benedict and she enjoys it - she gives them a 4/5 (and she eats them just about everywhere).  I've had a number of different breakfast dishes and find them to be good, but not any better than anywhere else.  \n\nI find the service to be very inconsistent however.  Like others have written when they are busy service can be really slow (I know it's difficult when it is busy - but this is Vegas and you know weekends will be extremely busy - you should plan around that).  So if it looks busy and you're in a rush you might want to avoid this place. \n\nThe weird part is that even when they're not busy service is hit and miss.  Most recently they couldn't get our order straight.  My wife was offered fruit or hash browns with her meal - she ended up being given both (although it looked like a half order of each).  I asked for bacon with mine and ended up with ham.  They fixed it all and no problem but she wrote our order down and it wasn't busy... How do you mess that up?"

I pointed this out to the server who asked if I wanted him to take it back and get something else instead.

I was then billed for both items when I asked about this they were not willing to correct it and said that they had to make both dishes it is not their fault I am not happy with their food.\n\nIf you want actual corned beef go to Ri Ra in the same casino.

We order a parfait, donut, hot tea, and fresh juice. Everything except for the juice was grabbed from the counter. The juice took over 15 minutes. Everything was already pre-cut in a cup, all the person had to do was add orange juice and blend.\n\nThey were clearly understaffed, and for the prices they charge there is no excuse.\n\nAlso, when I was paying the second day the girl working the register asked if I needed a receipt. When I said yes, she handed me the itemized receipt. I asked her where the credit card receipt was and she said she threw it away. I told her I needed it because this was a work expense. She then proceeded to dig through the garbage until she produced my crumpled receipt. That is not okay, if someone says they want a receipt they should be given both receipts, or at the bare minimum the credit card receipt.\n\nThis place would be good if they could just get their ish together!"

Their motto should not be that it's some sort of city-wide ziplock sealing so tightly that not even vapors can escape, the metaphorically alluded-to \"municipality as black hole\". No. Their motto should be one more truthful and perhaps more pithy. That new motto of which I speak would go something like this: Nothing exceeds like excess.\n\nAnd perhaps no place encapsulates that better than this place. Want to know what's in the dessert case? Well you can just walk (or waddle) yourself over there and go look. The dessert menu has five things on it (order any of these and they're huge). The dessert case has probably 5X that, but damn if they will tell you what that is. The menu itself has a number of things on it. Order any of them but appetizers and they come on a cookie sheet. This not only does wonders for the carefully crafted ambiance, but adds a flair of mystery to things. For instance, I can't begin to imagine the food waste this place must go through, but I'm betting they toss a lot more than anyone ever eats. \n\nActually, given the flavor, this is almost a guarantee. I can almost hear you smacking your lips right now? You mean to say we can get a bunch of substandard - and here, this word is best - \"grub\", served by some very smarmy prick who looks vaguely like Fred Arminsen, but is far from funny or even amusing (wait, maybe it is Fred Arminsen!), yet has a full-tilt condescending attitude that all but insists we should be grateful he can be deigned to bother with us mere mortals. Maybe that's it. Maybe the wait staff in this elegantly laid out pristine and serene little oasis from the flood of body odor and stale cigarette smoke isn't here for us, but rather that we're here for them. Now I know why I flew here. I wonder if it would be an insult if I tipped 150%...I'm in but I have to get back out somehow.\n\nThen again, it's a great deal, if you get a lot, right? It may be expensive, but at least it's mediocre! Expensive is the nature of the biz in Vegas and comes with the territory and so, apparently, does throwing any old thing in front of people.  This place clearly doesn't care about patrons coming in and out and is one of the more jaded places I've seen. Maybe they ought to just throw all in and go for \"Citizen\" by way of the old Soviet Union. I'm thinking a food line with metal bowls and plates. The only thing served will be potato soup with cabbage and garlic, along with a small roll that may or may not be moldy. Drink choices are cheap vodka or brackish water. If nothing else, it would at least accurately mirror the contempt for the customers this place clearly seems to have.\n\nAlso, like everything else in Vegas, this place is loud."

We all ordered appetizers since we werent super hungry. We ordered the waffle fries that came with gravy and bacon bits...yea If you plan to order it, dont... Why? Wholly cow, it is heavy on the sodium. So the ones that got soaked in the gravy is not edible :(. The other items we ordered were pretty generic, chicken fingers (basically just fried chicken strips) and a cup or veggies (you know the ones you get in the frozen aisle in the market?)\n\nIf we were crying over the appetizers already, imagine the main course!!"

I will say one thing the amount of food you get for the price is decent as my sandwich was HUGE. The chicken was fried well and the buffalo sauce was pretty good. The Blue Cheese was a little strong personal preference wise (I like bleu cheese but not the amount I had on my sandwich). Even given the portion, taste and ambiance of the restaurant the one thing that stood out for me was the price sadly. Even with the amount of food you get, the taste really didn't wow me at all and I left thinking \"I paid quite a bit...\" Probably won't come back as this place wasn't that memorable for me."

Brunch might be the best time to go if you want to pig out on plenty of sweet and savory offerings like I did. The massive stack of red velvet pancakes may be one of the better versions in town. Just bring family or friends to make a dent in it. The creme brulee French toast is another exceptional rendition on a classic with bread dense enough to soak up and retain plenty of custard and a well crusted exterior that provides plenty of crunch. \n\nFor savory options the kobe chili cheese fries were good -- particularly the light, crispy waffle fries that held up well under the meaty chili. They don't skimp with portion sizes on that dish or the big meatball parm, which is a single baseball sized hunk of beef and pork topped with a dollop of ricotta and sitting in a pool of sauce. A less than stellar dish is their ultimate tots -- standard tater tots covered in cheese and gravy. The chicken and waffles also proved to be decent, but far less memorable than the other dishes we tried.\n\nEnding the meal was an excellent house-made carrot cake. It's moist and dense spice cake foundation with subtle hints of carrot were complimented by plenty of sweetness from a smooth and creamy cream cheese icing. \n\nIt's clear that the Light Group knows who their target audience is and how to satisfy them. With Citizens, they deliver comfort food fit for a casual meal any time of day"

It is nice to have healthy options, so I indulged in a fresh made juice and a breakfast sandwich. Juice was good (I would hope so for $9!) and the sandwich was just ok as it was warmed in the microwave.

It was definitely cheesy and baked to perfection but the broth wasn't as robust as I'd hope it would be, however, they sure didn't skimp on the onions!  Soup was $12.\n\nFor my entree, I had their Lobster Roll w/Pasta Salad.  I've had my taste of what a true Lobster Roll tastes like from a couple spots in the East Coast.  Unfortunately, this Lobster Roll had more pieces of celery than lobster; it was really disappointing, especially with a $23 price tag. The Pasta Salad also seemed like it was under cooked; the pasta that is.\n\nOverall, there are FAR, FAR, FAR better spots to eat in Vegas, can't speak for the other restos in Mandalay Bay.

Naomi was our server twice out of the four visits (the only reason she wasn't for all four visits was because she wasn't working the other two times we requested her) and it was as if she was a friend feeding us at her house.  Very accommodating and friendly.  If you want AWESOME service ask for Naomi or Bailey.  Bailey was mrs \"Johnny on the spot\" fun, spunky and there when we needed her, just as it should be!  There was one server (who shall remain nameless to avoid any scandal or shame) that we weren't super pleased with... not awful... just came off as a bit cocky and arrogant.  However the food more than made up for it (French onion is amazing and their breakfast skillets are D-LISH).  An added bonus was that the prices & food quality compared to the other places at Mandalay couldn't compare.  You won't be disappointed if you swing by!

We ordered a Stella (I had water, boooooo), fried calamari and home mustard buffalo wings. When our food arrived, it was more than enough for two people. The wings were juicy and flavorful. The bleu cheese dressing was creamy and not tangy like some cheap substitutes. Fried calamari wasn't greasy and we ended up scarfing that down first. All in all, a good experience.

Apaca and Joe were our servers for our dinners and Robert served us breakfast.  All three servers recommended excellent dinners and Joe recommended a great breakfast choice.  It's a hidden gem in Vegas. Staff is friendly, restaurant was very clean.  I recommend the Reuben, Meatloaf, Gumbo and for breakfast sandwich or Eggs Benedict.  \n\nI have traveled to Vegas 5 times in the last 90 days and stayed at high end to average resorts and this is my new favorite restaurant."

Our waiter was awesome, Greg, there when we needed him and let us chill when we needed to. We had a great dinner with great service. If that is what you are looking for then give this place a chance. And about the prices, your in Vegas, in a casino, you are not going to get prices like your eating at Denny's. Note: most meals are large enough to be shared. That can help you save some money."

Citizens Kitchen and Bar was like a shining beacon that drew late diners in like a moth to a flame. Honestly though, it was our our only dining option at 1AM inside Mandalay Bay (thank goodness for 24 hour eating establishments, right?). Citizens was actually pretty crowded at this time of night. We only had a 5 minute wait to be seated, so no sweat.\n\nCitizens is washed in bright lighting and white decor. Me and my gal pal were seated at a small table amid all the hustle and bustle. Our waiter promptly arrived to take our drink orders. When I got to looking at the menu, I quickly realized Citizens wasn't really a vegetarian friendly kind of place. I wasn't too worried because I was hungry but not like starving or anything so I was fine with getting an appetizer. Artichoke dip and chips it is! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a photo because my phone had died. :( The food came out in less than 10 minutes and was a good sized serving. I wasn't able to finish it all and left full. The dip had a great consistency and tasted great. Chips were yummy too.  \n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nI wouldn't go out if my way for Citizens, but if I find myself at Mandalay Bay in the wee hours of the morning I'd have no qualms about coming back.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #138"

Keep listening to your customers and I think you will do A-OK.\n\n\nReview from Feb 2, 2013.\n\nThe scene:\n\nCitizens Kitchen & Bar\nHotel: Mandalay Bay\nDate: Saturday, February 2, 2013\nTime: 12:00 pm\nThere was a UFC fight the same day. Picture lots of men on steroids with tons of testosterone, pent up rage and Affliction t-shirts.  HA\nFood: 1 Turkey Sandwich, 2 Iced Teas and Chicken Soup= $66.00\n\nI was craving some comfort food to help revitalize my energy levels. I had a giant sandwich on my mind, so I walked through the Casino in hopes of eating at the Red, White and Blue Restaurant. I come to find out that my favorite sandwich spot is closed and Citizen's Kitchen & Bar has replaced my go-to sandwich spot. Citizens prides itself on non fancy, REAL comfort food. The vibe is new American mixed with old fashioned comfort.  The environment was great, the service and food..not so much. When we arrived for lunch, there was one other group at the bar. We were told by our server that we were the first lunch customers EVER. \n\nSince we were the first lunch customers, I didn't come with ridiculously high standards. I was here with the most relaxed group of foodies. I grew up in a restaurant, so I'm always pretty calm and understanding when things go wrong, however there were so many mistakes and unkept promises, I was embarrassed for the restaurant. Charles Barkley showed up 1 hour after us and still got served before us. Haha  It took us 2 hours to get a cup of chicken noodle soup and a hot turkey sandwich. We were told 6 times that our food would be out soon. The hot turkey sandwich with gravy was COLD. One turkey sandwich, one cup of soup and 2 iced teas cost us $66.00, no joke. \n\nThe manager did not listen to us and acted as if we were an inconvenience.  We didn't get a discount, but they offered us free pastries. We  were not interested. We won't be coming back here. \n\nTip of the day: You are better off going to Subway or a food court for lunch.  Take your $66.00 to STK, getting a mouthwatering steak + the mac and cheese and enjoy ridiculously superb service."

I had just come off a pretty wild night so I was not looking for an all booze drink, but something tasty and classy for breakfast. Lizzie made me a double chocolate espresso martini. She used a rye based vodka which was very good. \n\nFor breakfast food, I ordered off of their Sunday brunch menu and had a French Toast Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9.it was pretty good tasting and I would recommend it if you are here for a breakfast item.\n\nI had a second drink which is also very good.

Three of them were working on one person's order b/c she must have had a comp meal or something but really there were at least 20 people in line while we listened to this. Once we made it to order, I just got the yogurt b/c I knew the wait for eggs might take until lunch. My friends got the banana pancakes and eggs benedict. The pancakes were huge, doughy and honestly just gross. There was nothing redeeming about them. The eggs benedict was okay but nothing too great.

But Wynn has much better casual restaurants with the same price level.\n\nService: If you are planning to order something over the counter, don't expect to get treated nicely. Just think you are at the local $3 burger shop, but the price is 5 times higher. First, the cashier / hostess at the counter, is not professional (I don't think they are rude. It seems like they just didn't get trained enough about how to serve customers politely).\n\nThe worst part is the manager, who is even worse. This place's manager (Mike) is the RUDEST manager I have ever met in my life. I saw another bad review about this place's manger, now I know why. if you have any issue with this place, don't even try to make it fixed with a manager, cuz it will make you look like you are the one with the problem. And don't try to explain what went wrong with your order, because the manage won't listen you.\n\nIf you don't care about the service, this place is good to go."

But...mmm...this is still a great choice.\n\nI had the fried calamari, French onion soup, Caesar salad, and steak frites -- to go. It was packed perfectly for me to take back to my room.\n\nThe calamari was tasty and lightly beaded. It was great even without the two sauces it comes with - cocktail and Thai chili. The salad was crisp and as fresh as you'd expect with a couple of large croutons. The French onion soup was savory with shredded onions and a layer of gooey cheese. No croutons in the soup and it was on the slightly sweeter side. The steak itself was good. I ordered it medium and it was a full 16oz steak. The fruit bowl was a nice way to finish it all off.\n\nService was fast but the wait for the food was over 20 minutes. *sigh* Pricey too but what else are you going to eat at this hour on Christmas day?"

Even though there were empty tables, it took around 10 minutes before we were seated. We ordered as soon as possible because we were starving and it took 30 minutes for our food to come out even though none of the dishes we ordered were complex. We ordered two salads, an artichoke dip, and a teriyaki chicken bowl. I got the BBQ chicken salad, and it was pretty good. There were a lot of different ingredients, such as beans, onion rings, corn, and avocado, so I didn't get sick of it. Portions were pretty big, and I was actually full from the salad, but I don't think it was worth $19. I also tried the artichoke dip, which was pretty good! It came with two different kinds of chips. I liked the pita one better. The artichoke dip was hot, creamy, and cheesy."

When you're staying at the Mandalay Bay, it's late night and there's nothing else to eat, this is the only option (besides room service but I honestly think room service and this place are one in the same.)\n\nThe 3 times I had to eat here was all different, experience wise and food wise. I only utilized the take out counter, thinking that this would be the \"faster\" route but it's not necessarily.  Price wise it's all going to be pricey because you're at the Mandalay/on the strip, but again if you haven't eaten all day and you have not other options, a $16 sandwich is suddenly doable and you're at the mercy of their service. I'll sum up my review in my visits:\n\n1st visit - Was 10pm, went in to grab a quick snack of fruit and a muffin. Really wanted ice cream but they don't serve that. Was expensive but at least service as quick as nothing needed to be prepped and there wasn't much of a line. Muffin was good, too. \n\n2nd visit - Was about 1pm, hubby ran in to grab a reuben sandwich, not sure how long his wait was but that reuben was way too salty! Could only handle 2 bites, not a fan...\n\n3rd visit - It was 11pm and I have no idea what was happening but it took them 20 minutes to even acknowledge my husband standing there at the take out counter! My husband has the patience of a saint and saw that they were extremely understaffed but why the hell does it take the manager 15 minutes to make one espresso? The poor dude who ordered the espresso just seemed amazed at the whole process too, but you can't badger someone who's touching your food, ya know? There was people just standing there waiting to pay for a canned soda and the one of only two employees behind the counter just said, \"take it\" and waived them off.  The more annoying thing? That there was other workers in that restaurant meandering around the take out area! Come on now, help them out! \n\nAnyways, I was ready to leave after the first 20 mins but my husband was really hungry and again, we're at the mercy of being out in BFE Mandalay at midnight. After being in there for over 30 minutes and not even having anything to show for it, I forced my husband to leave and bought him a banana and some Dibs ice cream in the sundries store to quiet his stomach until we could get a proper meal in the morning. \n\nThank goodness we were checking out the next day as well."

It's a casual place that's not affiliated with a celebrity chef, so you'll never have to wait for a table. \n\nItems we tried:\n\n- French Onion Soup: HUGE portion. I think this is easily a two person starter. It was very flavorful, and had lots of cheese. The previous Yelp reviews on this did not disappoint. \n\n- Kobe Chili Cheese Fries: I saw \"Kobe\" on the menu and knew I had to order it. Seasoned waffle fries came out with Kobe beef chili and a mini pitcher of nacho cheese. It was good, but it was very high in sodium (probably all chili cheese fries are). I would suggest trying this if you like chili cheese fries. \n\n- 2 Eggs Any Style Breakfast: Yum! The tater tots were delicious! I ordered scrambled eggs and they were good. Not rubbery at all. If you order bacon as your meat, you will get three slices. It's breakfast, so it's hard to really mess this up. \n\nOverall, I good casual spot for a quick meal if you're hungry and don't want to leave the area."

One of the homies recommended this place plus it was located in the hotel we stayed at. \n\nIt was a cute spot. Service was not memorable.  My turkey burger was good but meat kinda fell apart. The bf liked his food. But, it was kinda priceyyy!  \n\n3.5 stars for me!"

The next morning the waiter chose to not listen and didn't communicate to the chef what my travel partner wanted. He asked specifically for Banana pancakes that were on the menu. He ended up with regular pancakes with a couple of bananas thrown on top. The manager was spot on and professional and took control of the issue. I was very impressed and will be back. The food is top notch and I highly recommend Citizens for breakfast. It was quite tasty. The overall feel of the restaurant is spot on."

            "review": "Came here late night with my best friend and her co worker! It was literally not the first choice of dining but at 3:30-4 AM there isn't much of a choice in Mandalay Bay. The menu of course is going to be expensive because it's a hotel chain restaurant/deli or whatever. The down fall is that with it being so late they have a very selective menu to choose from so you don't really have many options! Our waiter was an airhead and we had to keep asking him for the necessary things that should've already came automatically such as napkins and water.. After spending over $60 for some basic ass meal I was completely over it because there's no way no breakfast burrito that small should've costed $13 and then the potatoes were basic with no seasoning.. My bf liked the food probably only because he was drunk but other than that I can't see myself eating here again unless I had a food and beverage credit from the hotel, but wait even then idk I would probably choose somewhere else..."
