            "review": "3.5 stars\n\nMet up with a couple friends here because this was their favorite Italian place to hit up every time they're in Vegas. Only heard nothing but good things about Rao's from the Food Network and on an episode of the Travel Channel's The Best Of, so I was stoked to finally get a chance to check it out. \n\nUnfortunately, the head chef (ex-wife of the Rao's owner) Carla Pelligrino no longer runs the kitchen. I think that might've had something to do with some of the lackluster dishes we were served that night. \n\nOf course my boys and I had to get liquored up on some bread and booze while waiting for our appetizers.\n\nAlcohol is pricey, but expected when you're in Vegas. \nWhat I didn't expect was how little alcohol was detected in our mixed drinks: \n- 2008 Chianti Classico Cecchi ($55)\n- Dirty Vodka Martini ($15.50)\n- Grey Goose Pear Martini ($13)\n- Chilled Belvedere Vodka shots ($12.50)\n\nThe cracker bread was the best part of the bread basket. Everything else seemed stale.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ?select=lhclSBefk34_8wOpgIbVCQ\n\nBRUSCHETTA (4 pcs for $17): Thinly sliced crunchy crostinis topped off with \n1) Tomato & Basil: Needed a touch of salt and some acid\n\n2) Marinated Artichokes: My piece still had the inedible fibrous hairy part of \"choke\" still intact. Not very lady-like of me to have to spit this out in front of the hot waiter walking by. Ugh.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ?select=R1ToPCJRYPVb8V-mtDhCsg\n\nRAO'S MEATBALLS (side order of 2 fist-sized meatballs for $16):\nThe first thing people mention when talking about Rao's is their famous traditional meatballs served with their house marinara sauce.\n\nCombining the right ratio of ground veal, pork and lean beef with pecorino cheese makes it oh-so flavorful and meaty! \n\nMy only complaint was that it was a bit on the dry side. Thank goodness for the marinara sauce! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ?select=dvcpo1Yh_IV7W-59ZsjcGQ\n\nORECCHIETTE CON BROCCOLI RAPPE (sweet italian sausage, broccoli rabe and garlic sauteed in extra virgin olive oil, $26):\n I enjoyed the sweet italian sausage very much. The casing had a fantastic bite to it, while the sausage itself remained oh-so-juicy and seasoned perfectly.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ?select=TK0ZVflco6pR06oWzxkEtQ\n\nEverything else was not up to par:\n1) The orecchiette pasta was undercooked. There were a bunch of them still stuck in hard undercooked clusters of 2 or 3 pieces. Imagine every forkful being hard and chewy.\n\n2) The broccoli rabe was so damn bitter that it threw off the entire dish. I LOVE broccoli rabe, it's bitterness is what makes it unique. But this was the first time I've had it overpower an entire dish. \n***A quick 1 min blanch prior to throwing it into the pasta would've saved this dish***\n\nSPAGHETTI ALLA BOLOGNESE ($27):\nGround beef, pork and veal (same mixture and tastes as their meatballs) cooked with San Marzano Tomatoes and herbs. \n\nThese particular plum tomatoes are less acidic and sweeter when compared to the usual Roma tomatoes used by most Italian places, so I could see how Rao's chose this for their tasty marinara and bolognese sauce. \nWould've been a perfect dish if it weren't for the overcooked pasta.\n\nRIGATONI FILETTO DI POMODORO (pancetta, sweet white onions and lots of black pepper, $25):\nThe same same San Marzano tomato sauce was used. The rigatoni was undercooked. But I could forgive that since there was a good amount of pancetta in the sauce. \nServed with a light dusting of pecorino cheese, we asked for extra cheese to cover the entire dish, lol! This pasta dish needed the extra saltiness from the pecorino cheese, trust."

And I am glad I did...\nVery good food - Just like you would expect from a good Italian restaurant.

The ravioli was sprinkled with cinnamon I think and had different cheeses inside. \n\nIt was such a welcome relief to eat here, you're set aside from all the Vegas noise and the quality was very fresh and the pasta was to die for! Table-side plating made sure everything was piping hot. I'll be back as soon as I'm back in Vegas!"

Great blend of cheese and italian herbs. Very well seasoned.\n\nOur mains were the rigatoni with proccuito in a red sauce, (forgot dish name..this is next day) and the penne vodka.  Both of the extremely delicious.  I also ordered the side of meatballs since they are often talked about.  I have got to figure out the blend they use for those balls because they were amazing.\n\nI don't understand some peoples bad experience here.   Yes the pasta is served al dente.  This is the best way to eat pasta, especially health wise. Look it up. Yes, this place is pricey but it is definitely worth it.  Though I was shocked that house merlot was $16 a glass, we enjoyed our last night in vegas.\n\nWill return in a heartbeat when we visit again!!"

I paired it with a barbera wine.  That was perfect.  Dessert was a chocolate and peanut butter creation that I still had room for.  It's not a cheap place to go, but worth eating at once during a trip to Vegas."

No lettuce, just all fresh calamari, shrimp, lobster, crab!  Pasta is great. Portions were always huge and we would take leftovers to our hotel refridge for later.  I've downgraded Rao's to 3 stars as they have really shrunk the portion sizes and especially the outstanding veal chop. Still tastes great but it is about half the size of what it used to be and quite fatty.  This has been the same over the last two visits and our waiter agreed with us. Of course price hasn't shrunk. Just disappointing as we loved it so much."

Reservations were a breeze to make and both times we were sat immediately.  The service is truly awesome.  Every person was attentive, friendly, and accommodating.  The menu is mostly traditional Italian with a few newer dishes added in for good measure.  The Caprese Salad is one of the freshest and tastiest I have ever eaten.  The eggplant parm was delicious.  However, the ravioli purses are definitely one of the most amazing entrees I have ever eaten.  The grilled veggies were a great accompaniment to the entrees.  The dessert menu (if you still have room for it!) is wonderful.  I highly suggest giving this restaurant a go.  You will not be disappointed."

They ran out of the veal chop, which half of my table was planning on ordering (veal parm or veal with arugula) the meatballs were fine, the salad was all right, my lamb chops were probably the best thing ordered by my table of 10. The chicken and peppers were too spicy to enjoy, the pastas were sad. I got no feel of the original in Brooklyn and guess that location is full of ambiance and tradition. The Ceasers location is just another Vegas spot with nothing special to offer."

But I don't think it was worth the price. \nI ordered the Lemon Chicken.\nWe put our order in at around 9:30, and the food came out only a few minutes after we had ordered. \n\nI'm not sure how they cooked multiple different types of pasta, and chicken in under a few minutes so the food must be precooked and sitting under heat lamps. \n\nThe lemon chicken was pretty good. Lots of flavor and the chicken was cooked properly. Definitely recommend ordering a side with it. While the chicken is very filling a nice side will make it a complete meal. I really wish they put a small side of pasta included, it would have really made the meal much better especially for $30. \n\nOverall, great service and pretty decent food. \nIf you're looking for a cheaper (but still really solid) option, there's a great Italian restaurant inside of the forum shops."

You miss out on the tiny, claustrophobic interiors, but that means you get to share second-hand cuban cigar smoke with more people! And the millions of pictures on the wall. And buy the homemade sauce firsthand, that three days ago, i picked up from a dominick's in chicago!\n\nJokes aside, i thought this was a great place. Maybe it had to do with the fact that it was a private hosted reception, and i got to meet the chef and the las vegas owners, the pellegrino sons, and maybe it helped that drinks were on the house.\n\nBut the history of this place is amazing. And they really look after you while you're eating here. Minute attention to detail, unobtrusive omnipresence (oxymoron time!) - i mean it; our server had a way of refilling our water, topping off the wine glasses, and bringing fresh bread without seeming to hover.\n\nI got the ravioli, and it was great. Their sommelier does a pretty good job of walking you through the options without being forceful, so all in all, the meal was great.\n\nCaveat, this was pretty pricey. But for an experience that you're not likely to repeat every week, might be worth a visit."

            "review": "Overview: Rao's was pretty good. Good New York style Italian. Not trying to do anything too fancy, for those of you who enjoy Classic Italian without a crazy twist. Although I will say that this place is totally overpriced. You could get just as good Italian food somewhere else for much less. But you won't be disappointed. \n\nVodka Penne: This was so good! Sometimes vodka sauces can be way too creamy and this one was the perfect balance between creamy and acidity. I think the pasta is all made in-house too, at least some of it is. And it's all really good. \n\nShrimp Scampi: Oh my goodness. I wish I could eat this every night forever. Out of all the meals I tried, this one was the best. Their shrimp were big, super meaty and had great flavor. The scampi sauce was the best I've ever had, and I make a mean scampi at home, so that's saying something. I recommend getting it with angel hair pasta. Super delicious. You have to try it. \n\nEggplant Parmesan: So this was the only thing we ordered that was just okay. I've had many eggplant parmesans in my life, so it's hard to find one that soars above the others. I think my issue was that it was a little bland and not crispy. Eggplant Parmesan needs to have a little crunch because of the natural sogginess of eggplant. This didn't really have it. Something that was good was the eggplant slices were really thick and there was a delicious layer of browned, melted cheese. Gotta love that cheese. \n\nThe salmon was also fantastic and very unique. Other favorites were the Steak Pizzaiola, and the Veal Parmesan. \n\nI would say if you are a huge Italian fan, give it a try. It's definitely worth the trip if you are willing to spend a little more."

Our server was exactly what you would expect to find in a New York Italian restaurant - like the Italian grandfather I never had. He was very knowledgeable about the menu, incredibly friendly (and a little grandfatherly), and anticipated needs before we could even ask.\n\nThe food was quite delicious. Definitely get the meatballs. Even if you don't usually care for meatballs (like me), get the meatballs. Probably some of the best meatballs you will ever have.\n\nMy standard Italian dish, which for me can make or break a restaurant, is penne vodka. And the penne vodka here was above and beyond. Penne vodka has been a favorite dish of mine since I lived in NYC - and Rao's, in my opinion, is the best place in Vegas for it.\n\nSadly, I never had the chance to eat at the original Rao's in NYC. It can be rather exclusive and quite difficult to get a table at. Vegas Rao's provides you the opportunity to experience the great food and service the original Rao's is known for, but without having to be a celebrity."

            "review": "We wanted to try a new Italian place in Vegas, and since most Caesar's restaurants have impressed us, we went with Rao's.  BIG MISTAKE.  Hundreds of dollars later, the only nice thing I have to say about Rao's is that the service was great and the ambiance is nice (Although Christmas-y.  In August.) but everything else?  Pass.  \n\nThis is what we had: \n\nCaprese Salad-  Weird.  The tomatoes were in huge quarters instead of slices and there was a pesto/garlic/balsamic sauce all over it.  The cheese was delicious but the rest?  Not so much.  \n\nCaesar Salad-  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  \n\nSalsa alla Marinara and a Side of Meatballs-  My husband had this dish and didn't dislike it, but didn't think it was anything great either.  I tried the meatballs in some marinara, and I'm not going to lie...there was an acidic, I-just-puked-in-my-mouth aftertaste that I couldn't shake.  Needless to say, I've had better meatballs.  And sauce.  \n\nPorcini Mushroom Risotto- I really thought this dish was going to blow my mind.  The menu lists it as:  \"Vialone Rice Cooked with Mushroom Stock, Sliced Porcini Mushrooms, Parmesan Cheese, and White Truffle Oil\".  What it actually is though is a different story:  Simultaneously mushy and hard rice with bland mushrooms, and an overwhelming truffle oil scent with a underwhelming truffle oil taste.  The busboy knew I didn't like it and offered to tell my server, but what is she going to do about it?  She didn't make it.  I'm just bummed we paid $30 for a dish I took five bites of.\n\nOverall, the place has potential, the service is great (I mean, a guy comes out and dishes your plates in front of you!), but it didn't do anything for our wallets or our stomachs."

First, they told us we would be seated and 15 mins later we weren't with a reservation. The server Nick was horrible. Less than attentive, never checked up on us and at the end when we were still drinking dropped off the check that was prepaid and left. We had to find another waiter up get us drinks.. I guess no effort when you automatically get 18%? The food was subpar. For $85 a person the portions were tiny. The calamari and salad were fine. The pasta was bland and noodles were undercooked. The entrees were tiny to share and not much flavor. The meatballs were average, the lemon chicken had no flavor and the veal was eh. The desserts were ok but again nothing special. With the service and the food I won't ever return here again, especially for a larger event with a preset menu.., way overpriced for the quality."

That isn't easy as there is cigarette smoke from the casino to compete with. We were going to sit inside which has a great interior like the classic old school NY Italian restaurant without being cheesy. We decided to sit on the outside part of the place. It was a little warm inside that night.\n\nService was great from waiter to busboy. It's usually a good sign when the bread they bring out which came immediately is great. My partner had the penne ala vodka and a ceasar salad. He said both were some of the best he has had.  I had the rigatoni with pancetta, onions and tomato sauce. It was excellent. It's not cheap here as most places are not in LV but I would happily eat here again."

Don't expect lettuce, but an excellent light simple dressing.  For my entree, I had Gnocci ala Bolognese.  The sauce was incredible: a perfect combo of their signature veal,beef, and pork combination that goes into their meatballs.  It was so good I ate it with a spoon to get as much sauce as possible.  My wife ordered the Lemon Chicken which was cooked perfectly and served on the bone.  Service was excellent.  For our children, they prepared half orders of penne with alfredo sauce and a pasta with smoked salmon."

In NYC, this restaurant has 10 or so tables and you need to make a reservation about a year in advance!  Here in Las Vegas, it's much more accessible.  And I'm glad it is because there's something incredible about the food! \n\nThe service here is hit or miss.  The first time I came years ago, it was flawless.  It felt like you didn't just pay for the food but also for impeccable and attentive service.  That's not to say it's poor now; just that there has not been as much attention to detail in recent visits.  \n\nThe wine list at Rao's is expansive and the sommelier is always knowledgable and helpful if we're having trouble deciding.  \n\nI love, love, love Rao's marinara and arrabiata sauce.  Good sauce is so vital to any italian meal and Rao's is among the best!  I sometimes want a little bit of a kick in my meal and they're usually accommodating by giving me a \"toned down\" version somewhere in between regular marinara and arrabiata.  \n\nYou HAVE to try the meatballs.  I don't even like meatballs but these are legendary!  The compliments come with 2 huge meatballs and they're great if you're splitting them as an appetizer or adding them as a side to your meal.  The ravioli purses are amazing!  I love that the servers carefully and delicately transfer your meal on to a plate right at the table in front of you.  The NY cheesecake with fresh berries is simply decadent.  My favorite dessert, however, is the peanut butter tart.\n\nWe came most recently for restaurant week and, at $50 for 3 courses, it was a steal!  The usual prices are the only thing that keep me from coming more often and, as it is, I already come every couple of months.  My mouth is already watering thinking of my next meal there!"

The food here is mostly pasta.  You would think for $30.00, and a serving size that would fit in a salad bowl, the pasta would be good.  Sorry, it's not good, and sadly, not even house made pasta, it is purchased outside, as told by the waiter. The fried calamari was nothing to write home about either. Three people, three pasta dishes, 1 appetizer, 1 meatball (half order) 1 glass of wine $285.00 not worth the money at all.  Only upside, waiter was very friendly."

A big piece of pounded veal, lightly breaded but still juicy. It was covered in san marzano tomatoes and generous amount of cheese. Even I could not finish it. The house wine was surprisingly good.\n\nReading some of the other reviews of this place, I am debating on how to deal with the pricing at this establishment. The pricing is high for Italian food but normal for what you pay at a restaurant for a meal in a better hotel in Las Vegas. And if it comes down to quality - that is definitely there.\n\nPlus they turned away Madonna at the NY location - that's worth an extra star by itself."

It is pricey, but for a special occasion... the pasta is excellent. \n\nCut to New Year's Eve 2012. I made an 8 pm reservation 6 months in advance. I called to confirm the reservation 3 days prior to the date. At no time did anyone mention to me that this restaurant does a mandatory prix fixe (price fixed) menu on New Year's. (Important Note: I don't eat meat) So our cute little party of 4 arrives at the restaurant, excited for a stellar meal, and we are informed by a polite hostess of the prix fixe menu. This menu is $140 per person. It does not include wine or drinks. The main course has no vegetarian options and there are no substitutions. \n\nWe were pissed and disappointed. We are not cheap, but none of us wanted a four course heavy meal that evening.  \n\nMoved our reservation to the next night with no problem (I really just wanted a nice bowl of pasta, Jesus). We show up the next day and are quickly whisked to a TINY booth. \n\nLong story short: \nWe order from a friendly waiter and receive several appetizers and dishes. The flavors are lovely, my fiance was particularly impressed with the bolognese sauce. Unfortunately for me, my first bite of Linguine and Clams with red sauce was FULL of sand and grit. OWW! My tooth!  I should have sent the dish back but figured I just had bad luck and soldiered on stupidly. Again the flavors were great, but when a guest is paying $30 for a plate of pasta, the kitchen better make damn sure there isn't SAND in the clam shells! \n\nAs we left, I mentioned my issue to a manager, just to let him know so that he could alert the kitchen. He could not have cared less. He gave me a half-assed, \"I'm Sorry,\" and walked off. Ass. \n\nWe will not be back."

Finding the place was a bitch. There are three dining rooms, two of which replicate the original vibe of the Rao's in NYC. I'd suggest requesting one of the 'original' Rao's rooms (tons of photos, Christmas lights, etc.) instead of the third dining area near the pool (which isn't very interesting). You enter the restaurant and walk through a great bar area to get to your table. The wait staff is pretty good - but I'd definitely ask for one of the New Yorkers imported to offer a higher level of service. \n\nI had grilled zucchini with crabmeat and shrimp which was DELISH. I split an order of lemon chicken (very moist and full of lemony flavor - and a great dish. $24) and penne alla vodka (very good - $20). I'd come to Rao's thinking that the servings would be 'family-sized' but they were really only sufficient for two adults with not much of an appetite. The house Chianti was very good, too.

Unfortunately, the orrechiette with sausage and broccoli rabe was swimming in olive oil. After dinner, we consulted the Rao's cookbook that was for sale in the store adjoining the restaurant and guessed that there was probably twice the amount of oil in our dish than was called for in its recipe.

I had three great wines and the wine steward was very helpful and down-to-earth. \n\nWe started with the meatballs, as an appetizer. Good news: they were very nice--juicy, soft, tasty and the sauce was simple and nice.   They were not mind-blowing, though. They were fine. \n\nWe split a bolognese for our first course. We both found it to be bland but acceptable, if a bit oily. It wasn't offensive, just really disappointing.  The pasta was spaghetti and, to be fair, it was cooked correctly. Again, plating table side was very nicely done.  We each ate maybe half of this dish. \n\nWe decided to split the second course, which was Chicken Scarpariello.  I was really surprised at this dish. It's well-reviewed and our waiter recommended it. All I can comment on was what was served on this night and on this night it was incredibly salty and sour. The number of cherry peppers was so high that the brine overpowered the entire dish.  I felt almost sick after eating. Between two of us, most of the dish was uneaten. I think we each suffered through one piece of the cut up half chicken. The dish includes a cream or butter but, for us, it just could not diminish the impact of all of those pickled cherry peppers.  We took it home and I gave it another shot the next day and felt exactly the same way. \n\nThe cannoli for dessert was overly sweet.  I like the glaceed (sp?) fruit pieces and this version had none. They opt instead to infuse the ricotta with Cointreau. It was fine, but not great. I missed a trace of cinnamon and vanilla. The shell was fresh and crunchy and good. \n\nThe bread basket was acceptable but uninteresting. They served a great, earthy  olive oil for dipping.  Its a shame. Much was fine but the Bolognese and the chicken were so disappointing.  I'm glad I went but I would not go again."

The ambiance was warm and welcoming with the perfect balance of class and comfort.  The reason that this review isn't getting 5 stars is because the waiter was really bad.  To wait for 10 minutes to be asked if we wanted another glass of red wine even though a refill was clearly needed at the time that our meal arrived is unacceptable - at least it a unacceptable anywhere that the price of a glass of wine is the same as the price of the wine bottle at the store.  \n\nAlso, there was no butter or vinegar served with the bread at the start of the meal, only olive oil.  While I've had some \"unique\" bread,  to serve cold bread without butter cheapens the meal.  Even after asking for it twice, our butter arrived with the busser right before he cleared our starters....the food however was fantastic.   We'll be back for the food...and to hope for a different server."

We started with a bowl of pasta fagioli - the worst we've ever tasted. I could only eat 2 spoonfuls. Then we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi on a bed of angel hair pasta. I sent it back because it wasn't cooked enough and was very fishy and had no flavor.  So I decided to keep it simple and order pasta marinara (there aren't too many other pasta choices). The sauce was awful - I took two bites and couldn't eat it, but I didn't want to send it back - I had had enough! My husband ordered the Ossobuco on a bed of risotto which was mediocre, and the risotto was over salted and not edible. The corkage is $35, so we opted to buy a bottle of wine for $121 - outrageous. We didn't have dessert or coffee. Our bill was $225 for wine, a pasta dish and an ossobuco. Don't waste your money.  No wonder it was so easy to get a reservation on a Saturday night.  We work hard for our money, and we don't want anyone else to get ripped off.  However, the staff was very friendly."

As I am no rock star, I have not been fortunate enough to get into the original, but Rao's in Las Vegas is itself amazing.  Large, loud, lots of ambiance, and the staff is top notch.\n\nGo there to eat a slow, lengthy, relaxing meal, talk, drink wine, and share a lot of courses and dishes, for goodness sake.\n\nWe skipped salads this time, but Baked clams are a must and are served exactly the way I remember them growing up in Brooklyn - plump, delicious, in a wonderful broth just made for dipping bread - if you haven't already finished the huge bread assortment with Rao's EVOO and balsamic. Remember, you need to pace yourself!\n\nAll of the pastas are awesome and just right for two people as a second course.  We had the spaghetti bolognese, very old school, and there was so much meat in the gravy, oh my, and you know by the depth of flavor that this cooked all day long to get it so sumptuous.\n\nStill with plenty of room for our entrees, we passed on our usual choices - the monster veal parmesan chop that spills over the large plate on which it is served, my favorite shrimp fra diavolo, and even Rao's signature meat balls.  I wish we could have had them all!  Instead, we shared the crispy eggplant parmesan and the melt in your mouth veal short ribs, served with incredible polenta, and split a side order of spinach.  All to die for.  \n\nStuffed, we still found room to share a cannoli, and sipped on expressos and sambucas to finish a PERFECT meal.\n\nIt's pricey, but hey, what what great things aren't.  Rao's is a must stop every time we come to Vegas.  No, I take that back.  We come to Vegas just to go to Rao's.  Maybe some day we will know someone who can get us into the original up in Harlem."

I was down...being half Italian I'm always down for Italian food!!! One thing I don't like to do is make reservations for dinner while on vacation...I like to have my places picked out where I want to eat, but it's really hard to follow a set schedule/itinerary.  Based on that I suggested we just go here early to eat dinner, around 5 after they open.  That idea worked out great.  We came in on a Monday night shortly after they opened and we were seated promptly - no problems there.\n\nFor starters you get a bread basket with a tomato flavored dip which was really good along with these huge cheese flavored crisps.  The wine list wasn't the most expensive I've seen in Vegas, but wasn't the cheapest either.  Our server was able to recommend a wine that paired great with the penne vodka I ordered.  For starters we ordered the meatballs... pretty big in size, and reminded me a lot of the meatballs my Grandma used to make.  My dinner was the Penne Vodka - and added sausage to it for the added protein as pasta alone won't fill me up.  This wasn't your usual vodka sauce which is super creamy...it was much better than that.  I was pleasantly filled at the end of my meal but left just enough room to share the angel food cake for dessert - sugar free, fat free, and gluten free so ... a little less guilt there!\n\nThis place was great all around...great food, atmosphere, and service.  I highly recommend coming here for dinner!"

Yes, it was overpriced for a plate of spaghetti with sauce, but he said it was the best sauce he had ever tasted. I ordered a ravioli special and it was excellent too.

The gnocci bolognese was very good (probably top dish), and the meatballs were a very nice companion (not the best meatballs I've ever had, those would be Arturo's mama's at Amalfi in Indianapolis of all places, but still very tasty), and then the veal chop was also a very nice finish to the evening.  We also enjoyed a very nice and very reasonably priced bottle of Amarone to go with the meal.\n\nDespite some of the other comments, service was very good, even though we were there on a Friday night and it was quite busy (is it never not busy here?).

The special seasonal pasta - purses with blue cheese, pears and cranberries in a sage butter sauce - was tasty, though the lemon chicken my friend ordered seemed to be *the* dish.  Our waiter was one of those old school guys, who'd been working at the high end restaurants in Vegas since the days of Frank and Sammy, and he certainly added to the ambiance, since the schizophrenic music selection (Christmas, Motown and a bit of Italian thrown in for measure) didn't do much.\n\nAnd outside a small misunderstanding on the wine order where the sommelier gal opened up a bottle about 4x the price of the one we ordered, it was enjoyable, if a bit overpriced for the food and ambiance.

Clearly, there is a big difference between the two, and it's not at all a good thing.   The table placed an order for baked clams, fried mozzarella, meatballs, and bruschetta as appetizers, and my partner and I split a Veal Parmagiana and a Penne a la Vodka as main courses.  What had me instantly worried was the speed with which the appetizers arrived.  Food was there in a matter of a few minutes. Baked clams take a while to bake, and when properly prepared arrive at the table piping hot.  Sure enough, the clams were barely warm, and intensely fishy.  We returned that dish to the kitchen immediately; the baked clams were inedible, and had clearly been made hours in advance and reheated, or something.  The remaining appetizers were unremarkable or just bad.  When the Veal Parm and the Penne a la Vodka arrived, I was holding out hope that the situation would improve.  It didn't.  The veal was nicely presented, but the tomato sauce was the most mundane, boring sauce ever, and the penne was completely unremarkable, even if it was the best dish of the evening.  They were just plain bad, and not worth the price.  Finally, the other couple who joined us ordered profiteroles for dessert.   They were the highlight of the meal, but not enough to save this sinking ship from capsizing.  There are plenty of good Italian restaurants in Las Vegas (especially off the strip).  I would recommend you try those first.  The food at Rao's is mediocre  at best, and not worth the prices charged.  Avoid."

The al dente penne tosses in the rose cream sauce with bits of ham always brings a smile to my face. I am still a kid that plays with his food. Lacing each individual piece over a prong of the fork and eating them one by one is my way to savor this pasta. The mix of veal, pork, and beef in the meatballs makes them what they are.

The celebrant decided on Rao's in Caesar's.  I had forgotten until I walked up to the restaurant that I had actually eaten there twice before.  After this experience, I remember why I didn't remember them the first two times.  \n\nOur night began with a phone call to the restaurant to find out the dress code/attire.  We were told that it was business casual and that jeans were not permitted.  We asked even for women if they were nice jeans and were told we would be \"turned away.\"  Upon arriving at the restaurant, the first guest I saw seated was wearing a Hawaiian print button up shirt, tan shorts and flip flops.  Next I saw a women in a tank top, white shorts and tennis shoes.  I had changed out of my outfit to meet their requirements, making us 20 minutes late, only to find out when we got there that we still would have been better dressed then some of the patrons.\n\nWe were seated in a far corner in the back of the restaurant.  Greeted promptly with menus and a discussion of the specials.  The rest of my party was a bit put-off when we were told that the poached salmon was actually served in a \"foil-bag.\"  We ordered drinks and reviewed the menu.  I explained what I had eaten before and what I thought might be good selections.  Being that I had been there before I decided to try something new.  Their vodka sauce is truly amazing and they had a ricotta shell dish that came with their famous marinara sauce, so I decided to switch it out with the vodka sauce.  The rest of the party gave their orders. \nOur waiter then became non-existent and seemed rushed or busy whenever he did finally come over to check on us.   Food came out after a long wait (the restaurant wasn't even busy)...mine looked like a glorified version of mac and cheese made with pasta shells and a vodka sauce.  I was very disappointed that there wasn't any ricotta in the shells.  When I inquired about it with the waiter, he told me I had ordered it that way.  I knew I had specifically asked for ricotta so he offered to bring me a side of ricotta.   The rest of the party was not satisfied with their meals either.  The waiter never asked what we thought about our meals.  When we finally got our check, we about passed out.  The drinks we had been ordering (Red Bull and house vodka) were $22 each.  These were tiny little cocktails that are served in the same size glasses that you get comp'd drinks in, while gambling in a  casino.  They charged separately for the Red Bull and vodka, which most places do, but charged us for a full Red Bull with each drink, with out bringing out the remaining Red Bull to the table (as most places do.)  We were appalled.  Dinner was over $250 per couple, the food was below average, and the service was horrible.  We even told him we were there for our friend's birthday and he looked at us like, \"so?\"  \nI can pretty much guarantee I will NEVER eat at Rao's again.  I am more than willing to pay decent prices for excellent food and service, but for what we received at Rao's, I would have rather gone to The Olive Garden and saved $200!  At least there I can get unlimited salad and breadsticks!  LOL\nI am not a glutton for punishment...this girl will NEVER make the mistake of going to Rao's for a nice night out with friends, EVER again."

For the price I shouldn't have to yell across the table and the cash man photo lady came while I was eating my appetizer and was loud and a little pushy - 2 5*7 photos are $40.\n\nI would return, but not for an elegant meal"

Additionally, the large bar area is fun for drinks before dinner (killer by-the-glass wine list). Regarding the food, the chicken scarpiello, seafood salad, and pasta bolognese were perfect! \nNote: the owner, Frank Jr., is a really nice guy.

Most of our dinner was good however for the price, some items were very underwhelming. The bread was very fresh and was served with 3 different types of butter, regular unsalted, roasted red pepper, and smoked honey which was delicious. We then split the meatballs which were delicious as well. However for 18 dollars I expected more than 2, or at least make them a bit bigger.  For entrees we got the lemon chicken which was quite good. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a nice lemon sauce. But 31 bucks, and no sides or vegetables? I know I'm on the Vegas strip so prices are high, but that's still a lot of money for just half of a roast chicken. The one dish that was disappointing was the linguini with clams. It was very bland and desperately needed some seasoning. For dessert we split the peanut butter tart which I enjoyed. It came with this maple candied popcorn which I thought was interesting. The wine pours were extremely stingy.  All in all I probably wouldn't go back to the Vegas location. Most of the dinner was good, but even on the strip, it definitely wasn't worth the price."

Being in Vegas and at Caesars, we knew what the price tag was going to be.  So \"value\" didn't even figure into the 2 star rating."

We ordered the garden salad, meatballs, and baked clams for appetizers.  The meatballs were amazing!  Super moist and flavorful in every bite.  We then ordered three entrees to share, penne a la vodka, veal parmesan, and another chicken dish with sausage and peppers (I can't remember the name).  The wait staff shared the penne across 5 plates and we just added the meat dishes to our own plates.  Three entrees was more than enough for the five of us.  Service was great throughout the meal.

We made reservations for a 6:30 dinner, but due to our schedule, we showed up early and they were more than happy to seat us around 5:45.\n\nThe menu options made it difficult to choose, but I finally decided on the Ravioli Purses while he chose the Rigatoni Filetto di Pomodoro. We debated ordering appetizers, but given how much we'd been eating on our vacation, we bypassed it and enjoyed the amazing freshly baked bread that came out.\n\nI was absolutely shocked by how fast the food came out! I was expecting 15 minutes at least, but I swear, it was only five minutes before a server came out with our dishes. With a glass of wine each, we dove into our food. There's not too many ways I can describe what we had as ~*delicious*~. Amazing and subtle flavours, this was nothing like I've had before. We both cleared our plates and despite not having an appetizer, were quite full and happy by the end.\n\nThe service itself is amazing. One of the chefs came out to go over the specials and make recommendations, as well as review the wine list with us. He came out several times to check up on us, and the servers were also extremely attentive and courteous. \n\nWhile a bit on the pricy side, I'd say that Rao's is worth it. Between the quality of the food, the speedy service, and the amazing attention to detail, we were more than happy with the bill, which wasn't that pricy when I think about it. I've had good quality Italian before and this was quite reasonable by the end of the meal. I would be more than happy to go back at some point in the future!"

The highlight of our meal was probably the ample amount of bread that was served along with a very tasty bottle of olive oil.\n\nIn my unprofessional opinion, Rao is a place that gained notoriety not for its food, but for the smallness of its original location in New York. Any restaurant that charges many thousands of dollars to \"buy\" its tables for the year is bound to create buzz and I believe Rao Las Vegas has ridden that buzz all the way from Harlem. If you're in Vegas for a month, Rao might be a viable dinner stop for your trip, but for the majority of Vegas tourists, your money is MUCH better spent elsewhere."

            "review": "My girlfriend and I are hardcore devotees of Rao's pasta sauces. \n\nStore-bought or not, these lil' jars of flavor can easily elevate any old pasta meal to the next level, thanks a blend of fresh ingredients and an emphasis on natural, genuine flavors. However, despite having spent the better portion of her life in NYC, my girl has never had the chance to visit the actual Rao's outpost in New York's Upper East Side (although you can't really fault her for not being one of the place's dozen or so lucky regulars...!). Thus, in celebrating our six months together earlier this summer, we jumped at the chance to visit the restaurant that bears the very same name as our favorite brand of Italian food products.\n\nThe atmosphere at Rao's is homey and down-to-earth. Upon entering, the dark woods and dim lighting immediately transported me from the charged, uptempo atmosphere of the Strip into something akin to Michael Corleone's dining room. The charm at Rao's was all the more amped up by our table, which was located in the restaurant's \"Christmas\" room (see photos!). Complete with a staggering variety of portraits depicting NYC's who's who, the room does an outstanding job of making you as though you're part of \"the club.\"\n\nThe best detail of all, however, was was the loud, borderline obnoxious New Yorker seated one table over - whose accent made him stand out from every other conversation in the room. We couldn't stop giggling at his exclamations to his tablemates (\"The food here is absolutely pheNAWmenal!\" \"Waiter, we're gonna need maw woine!\"), and it was thanks to him that our dinner felt pretty much as New York as a meal could get.\n\nThe vibes of family and gracious charm were driven home by the fantastic service that we received from a gent whom I believe is named Alex. Despite the flurry of questions thrown (We must've asked him about 6-7 entrees that we were choosing from, each of which he explained in lovingly extensive detail!), Alex never gave us anything less than his undivided attention. I'd give his service six stars, if I could.  \n\nWe started out with a couple glasses of the house wise, which was refreshing, crisp, and palette cleansing. \n\nThe Caprese Salad appetizer was earthy and fresh. The creamy burrata and heirloom tomatoes combined to create a wonderful melding of flavors. The house blend balsamic used at Rao's, however, was a show-stopper; we learned that the vinegar used by Rao's undergoes a specific, twelve-year aging process (so as to maximize its depth of flavor). The results of this process were easy to identify, and I had to pry myself away from a second bread basket to make room for the rest of my meal. \n\nIn the hopes of getting a full idea of what the menu at Rao's had to offer, we ordered three entrees - my girlfriend got the Spaghetti Bolognese, I ordered Beef Lasagna, and we tacked on a serving of Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken, too. (Needless to say. we were in full indulgence mode.)\n\nOur food was brought out quickly, and in mammoth portions; my Lasagna alone seemed like it could've been used as a boat anchor. These big serving sizes were much appreciated, however - as the flavors of Rao's entrees were just as massive and satisfying. The bolognese blends used in our two pasta dishes were fantastic, striking a welcome balance between meatiness and crisp tomato flavor. My lasagna had to have been seven or eight layers deep - with ricotta, parmesan, and mozzarella lending a creaminess that counterbalanced the umami meat flavors of the bolognese.\n\nThe Lemon Chicken was juicy and had a great char. The strong lemon flavor paired off well in between bites of tomato sauce-laden pasta, but I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed a full serving of this dish on its own. The tanginess might have gotten a little played out without accompaniment from another entree.\n\nThe icing on the cake for our Rao's experience was that of our unexpected dessert course (no pun intended!). While being seated, I briefly mentioned that my girlfriend and I were celebrating an anniversary. Although the GF and I were given a dessert menu to scope out towards the conclusion of our meal - a very clever deception tactic on the part of the Rao's staff - we were entirely blindsided when Alex presented us with a heaping (and free!!!) portion of Caramel Apple Cheesecake, complete with a message from the chef. As he explained, \"a little birdy\" had happened to mention that we were commemorating a special occasion, and we were absolutely swept off our feet by this unexpected gesture of hospitality. With plenty of leftovers, my girlfriend and I waddled out of Rao's with the biggest grins on our faces!\n\nAccording to its menu, Rao's has been serving up homestyle Italian food for over a century. All this practice definitely amounted to something - I haven't had an Italian meal this memorable in a long time, if ever. Paying another visit to Rao's is near the top of my things to do the next time I'm in Sin City."

We made it a point to dine here on our short visit in town. So I made reservations that morning for dinner in the evening on the phone with no problem.\nOnce we arrived at Caesar's that night. We walked through the casino floor and past a few shops to get to the restaurant. Inside the hotel is a challenge to travel from here to there but the hotel staff are very helpful with directions if you get lost.\nThe service at Rao's that night was exceptional. Our waitress Angela was amazing. Her wait staff were just as good. Never had a dirty plate, fork, etc. the whole dinner. Water glass always full. Asked Angela for some recommendations and she was spot on. She really knew her stuff and made us feel special.\nThe food speaks for itself. Rao's have the best meatballs anywhere. No one does it better. There famous for it for good reason. If you come here. Start with that. You haven't lived until you have eaten the meatballs. I am serious.\nThere isn't anything bad on the menu that I have tried. From the salads, to the pasta dishes, to the pork chops. Yum, yum and more yum. Dessert? I go with their classic cheese cake. Delicious.\nRao's is my wife's and my favorite place to dine in Vegas. The service is top notch. The dining is classy, romantic, old school. The food is epically amazing. I wish I could give Rao's more stars. They deserve it. Bravo Rao's. My wife and I are your fans."

The service was almost too attentive, our waiter told us about the history of Rao's (I grew up in CT, kinda of knew, but not really), gave us an excellent rundown of the menu and allowed us to be unpretentious with our wine choices. Two of us were sat in a booth in a busy, but sociable room off to the left side. \n\nWe went for the full-bellied Italian order of the Mozzarella in Carrozza, arugula salad, veal parm (on the bone!), with the tomato and ham vodka cream pasta. Oh, and don't forget the meatballs and gravy..... \n\nAlthough we were in a food coma (need to upload picture to prove it), we enjoyed the meal and wine thoroughly (and dreamt about the meatballs for months). We couldn't wait to come again. \n\nOur next visit was in July 09. We had a Caesar's concierge make our reservations and dined at a more reasonable hour before 9pm. Although the house was packed, we had a very competent, but indifferent waiter who may have spent too many years in the business to add anything special to the experience. With no other guidance other than \"whataya want?\", we fumbled our way without an app (no recommendation, no order), warm white wine (I had face my trashy side and put ice cubes in the wine) an uninspiring salad, and somehow, the \"parm and balls\" just didn't hit the same high notes. After moving to red, we didn't even finish the bottle. \n\nMaybe it was the summer season, the heat taking it's toll, the down economy on Vegas, or something hidden, but the place didn't have the twinkle of that first visit. \n\nOh Rao's, if you want America to buy those sauces and pastas now found from Kroger to Shop Rite, you better give people a memorable experience in your carnival sized restaurant. \n\nAlas, I'll give it one more try, if I'm not broke off playing craps by the time dinner rolls around that evening...."

Special thank you to the owner for singing to our birthday girl, Jessica C, and offering up complimentary tray of desserts!\n\nI like the ordering options here. You can order individually, or choose some dishes that are made for sharing. However, when I dine with friends all our food ends up being sharing!  Also it is a good place to pick for diners who like solely plant based food and/or meat. \n\nOur dining experience happened after a show at the Palace, so we dined late. This may be a tip for late diners, some menu items may be out! Eeeeeekkkk... this happened to my friend, Mel K, but luckily she found another suitable option.\n\nOur table sampled a variety of dishes:\n\n-roasted beet salad\n-caesar salad\n-special of the day - salmon\n-grilled veggies\n-several of the pasta dishes\n-and not to forget the meats\n\nI really enjoyed the roasted beet salad for the flavour and fresh ingredients. I also liked that my greens were not soaked in dressing =D  Caesar salad was good but nothing interesting to make it stand out. The salmon was terrific as well as the grilled veggies.\n\nOne con is the restroom situation. For the size of this restaurant and location within the Caesars Palace, there is a single stall bathroom for each male and females. This means for the ladies, a LOOOONNNNG line. Not a favourite when dining.  However, the bathroom was large and cozy for those \"private\" moments."

I had the Shrimp Scampi over linguine, pretty good but nothing to get crazy about.\n\nThe server we had was slow and shaky, such as having to be asked 3 times for a glass of wine.\n\nI never pay close attention to the bill, however my wife does. She asks me what this random $7 charge was on the bill. I was going to pay it do we could just go but she insisted on asking. The server says that was for distilled water. Then I was confused as we ordered a bottle of Pellegrino which was also $7 and was already on the bill. After a little back and forth, he finalyy had the $7 removed.\n\nThis little incident turned me off completely to this place and I would never even consider on going back. \n\nPlease either consider a different Italian Place or check your bill carefully."

Well this place did have a little attitude.... the hostess told me there was no seats available except for the bar as it is first come first serve. As I passed by an open table i checked out the bar which was packed  with only 1 bartender for about 20 guests. As i was going to ask about the free table the hostess  was now seating another couple there. I was a little perturbed and told her there were no seats.... she said she didnt know how long it wold be, and then she  asked what i wanted to eat. How about the pasta I said? To my surprise she then began to list a few places to go! Well i came out  to try  that \"goodfella attitude\" anyway!  I told her we came here to try this place and she just said.... \"oh\"  .....well I guess they have their own way to handle things! Anyway after another couple tried to hawk down a free table (saved by our waiter) we got a seat. This place is just a no frills Italian eatery with wonderful simple sauces (vodka and a san marzano tomato)  and al dente pasta. Im sure the atmosphere and friends made this a hangout joint for all the Sopranos in NYC! Here its kinda like a classic place that you must try, but you will probably find better food for the price. My lunch for 2....  and no drinks (ice tea) was $85.00. However I like old school places and sometimes a \"Tommy's  Chili burger\" can really hit the spot over an \"angus prime beef burger\" at the four seasons !! But as opposed to here the Tommy burger is waaaayyy cheaper!"

Italy being one of my favorite countries, and food.   Ceasars Palace Rao's is in my opinion a total rip off, in pricing and quality of food comparatively speaking.  When you pay 27 dollars for a spaghetti plate I expect something rather good, if not the best.  The spaghetti we got was no better than chili's or spaghetti warehouse type but they only charge 10 dollars.  Serious, I ordered Osso Buco, and it was 47 dollars, believe me, it was the worst i've had.  The buffets in vegas had better Osso Buco, the texture was bad, and had little to no taste to it.  considering the cost of this meal, come on Ceasars Palace you can do better.  Learn from Wynn, and learn from Ballagio.  The manager was nice to offer a comp desert and coffee, but seriously they should have done better, just for customer service.  I'm definitely not dining at any of the Ceasars group chains again, value is the name of the game to customer loyalty, you can't charge high prices just because, provide something decent in return.  total disappointment."

Didn't Mussolini and Hitler form some sort of tag team about denying people what they wanted or some such?\n\nNot that I'm comparing the inability to order a set of damn meatballs to genocide, but I've actually been told I couldn't get food there; nobody's ever tried to shove me into a gas chamber.  Melt me in lava, impale me, throw me off of catwalks that don't meet OSHA standards, wreck my pod racer, and ignite the bio gas coming from the Deathstar's latrines with a bomb, sure.\n\nHere's the deal:  If your website says you are open till midnight every night.....when someone shows up at 11, don't tell them that you closed an hour and a half ago because it was \"a vittle slow\".  It's Vegas - the town never shuts down.  You're telling me that you closed your entire restaurant in a major strip casino 2.5 hours early because you felt like it?  This has happened 2 of the last 3 times we've gone there.  \n\nDo these people have ANY idea how hard it is to find parking for the Deathstar?  Those resort parking lots are designed for 9 dollar a day subcompact rentals, not capital spaceships.  And don't even get me started on what happened last time I parked it valet - I'm still paying the fines associated with the planetoid they blew up because they thought the Deathray button was the e-brake.  It takes effort to get to this place.\n\nThe worst part is just how unapologetic and rude these people are about it.  Look, I've dined at the Harlem location.  I know that you have to book it half a year in advance and if you don't like it then that's no sweat off of them because....well....you have to book it half a year in advance! But this is a much larger space in a major Vegas resort, and one that I have never seen at more than 20% capacity.  You aren't that damn special.  You aren't afforded the right to be a bunch of jackasses.  You guys are lucky that I had a 50,000 game Keno ticket at Caesar's that I wouldn't have been able to check on had I been thrown out of the casino for Force Choking all of you, otherwise it woulda been the end of all of you.\n\nThe food?  It's delicious when you can get it.  The meatballs are literally the best I've had anywhere.  Of course, the Lady Vader has figured out how to perfectly replicate them, so we don't need you for that.  The pasta dishes are delicious, but nothing that can't be easily replaced by venturing about a mile off strip and going to Ferraro's.   The service alone drops this thing all the way down from a solid 4, possibly even a 5, to a 2.  And rest assured, we will NOT be returning to be denied for a 3rd time out of the last 4....which is probably best for the staff's health.  \n\nA very sincere \"shove an iLightsaber up your ass\" and a score of 2 Deathstars."

In the old days finding a decent meal for a New Orleans' boy was next to impossible. Of course people did not go to Las Vegas to dine. And food was inexpensive at the same time. That has changed. \n\nToday you pass a grand time enjoying some very palatable culinary wonders. Rao's is a restaurant I would recommend. The original restaurant was started in New York, New York in 1896 and is still owned and operated by the same family. They do a very good job as far as the food, service and atmosphere along with a respectable wine list.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the statute of the Blessed Mother. For those of Italian decent and Catholics I am sure that was notice. There is no pushing of religion at all but I do believe the owners are just showing respect.\n\nReservations were made long in advance and there was no problem with the handling of those reservations. Since my wife and I were staying at Caesar's we can't tell you about parking for the place. I signed up for their player's card and received a $20.00 discount for any restaurant in Caesar's. With the prices now at this play spot that is helpful.\n\nThe servers were all personable and professional. We informed our waiter we were not in a rush and from New Orleans and there to dine. All went well. Jim, Mike, and Adam who assisted with wine selection could not have provided better service without being invasive for a night out with my wife. \n\nThe Penne Vodka was totally enjoyed by my wife. San Marzano Tomatoes, Prosciutto Cotto, Vodka, and Cream in a very tasty and large portion made her contented. \n\nMy choice was the Veal Parmesan which was pounded and breaded. This is a most enjoyable piece of meat and the serving is large. Cost is high and portions are large. \n\nCould not resist and knew it was a bit much but also had to taste the Meatball. Humongous meatball made with Ground Veal, Pork and Beef. Well seasoned and covered with Italian Breadcrumbs and Marinara Sauce.\n\nA bottle of Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon was just dandy with the meal and we ended with some very fine Cappuccino.\n\nThe tables are apart so that conversations are private. The background music is at an acceptable level and the music being played was perfect for the ambiance of the restaurant. Food is tasty and flavorful and it is accompanied with attentive but not invasive service. So happy to have selected Rao's over so many choices and will return on any future visit to Las Vegas."

On the other hand, the baked clams, bruschetta, \"pasta of the day,\" veal marsala, and the veal chop were among the worst I have ever had.  The bruschetta tasted like canned artichoke hearts.  The breading on the veal marsala was mushy, and the veal itself was overcooked.  The sauce was thick, syrupy, and had no mushroom or lemon flavor.  It tasted like brown gravy with a splash of wine added.  The \"pasta of the day\" was a pasta in mushroom cream sauce.  The pasta was overcooked, and the sauce tasted like a beef stroganoff without the beef.  The veal chop was almost raw in the middle (coming from a group of medium rare meat eaters at that), and was also tough, and lacking in flavor.  The cherry pepper sauce was great, but not enough to cover up the undercooked, underseasoned piece of meat it was served with.\n\nOther than the veal marsala, nothing was terrible, but for the prices, definitely not worth it, and compared to the stories we have heard from the NY restaurant and recipes we have tried at home from the cookbooks, very disappointing.  Definitely my most underwhelming dining experience in years."

After sitting down and ordering a nice bottle of wine my family and I preceded to sip our wine and figure out what we were going to eat. We each only ordered a pasta dish (due to our indulgence at breakfast and lunch). The wine expert or sommelier ... not sure... made us feel comfortable and not rushed at all, we felt welcome to enjoy ourselves. We finally told the server our order which consisted of the spaghetti, the pear pasta, and the rigatoni I believe. After ONLY about 3-4 minutes our food came out, revealing that it was pre-made and probably heated up. The busboy transferred our food from a heat saving dish to our plates in front of us. After tasting our food it was OKAY. It wasn't bad but it also was nothing to rave about. The only other italian place I have eaten in Vegas is Carmine's which is located in the Forum shops of Caesars and I would 100% say it is tastier. I am sure there is much better, more authentic italian food that is not pre-made found all over Vegas. I would not recommend Rao's to anyone visiting Las Vegas."

The lemon chicken was amazing!  It definitely lived up to the hype.  The gnocchi was great, but after having a bite of lemon chicken, it didn't compare (hence reason the almost 5 star review).\n\nThis place had a nice and intimate feel, and I definitely felt removed from the rest of the strip while eating there.  All in all, the service was fantastic and the food was great and I would eat here again."

The highlights from our meal were the meatballs, which were extremely moist and flavorful, duck cannelloni, the lemon chicken, which is another of their signature dishes, ravioli purses, which wasn't a favorite around the table, but I really enjoyed the sweet and savory elements and the veal parmigiana. \n\nThe desserts were classic and delicious as well.

Maybe with the jealousy in play, my expectations were higher than they should have been, but I would have thought that for the price and expectations, the service and experience would have been a bit better.\n\nFirst was the table - round tables, especially for large groups, suck.  We were crammed into the table, our feet kicking one another and having to eat like we were preying mantises (think of eating with your elbows glued to your sides).  \n\nSecond was the service - for a $$$$ restaurant take the ladie's orders first and keep track of who ordered which dish so that we aren't shuffling food around when it is served.\n\nThird was the appetizers - the waitress recommended family style and in a compromise we decided to have a bevy of appetizers to share.  However, for a restaurant that recommended family style they were impossible to serve and cut up.\n\nFourth was the drinks - excellent drinks but sheesh this is Vegas, keep them coming!  Be attentive!\n\nNow the goods - great food.  I had a veal with salad peppers (gave it a little kick) that was unlike anything I have had before and tasted excellent.  I also had a great apple tart dessert which achieved great balance.  So many desserts are excessively sweet and rich these days; it's nice to have one that is lighter, not so sweet, and showcases the flavors of the ingredients.\n\nAlso, the portions were well defined.  By no means did I leave hungry, but I was able to have dessert and leave without feeling like a glutton.  I ate everything that I would have wanted to."

But when I'm told I'm unable to gain admittance to one of NYC's stalwart Italian restaurants, I can't help but feel the need to sneak my way in. The original NYC Rao's has a 100+ year history in East Harlem and is a celebrity-laden experience that reserves tables for \"members.\" So unless you're a \"friend of a friend\" as they say, you ain't getting in.\n\nSo what recourse does a regular Joe or Jane have? Take a flight to Vegas and stop by the Rao's at Caesar's Palace! The menu is virtually the same along with an attempt to provide the same \"in the know\" experience. It's also replete with snarky, but experienced servers - a classic old school Italian touch.\n\nBread Service\n\nYou start off with Italian bread, which wasn't served warm, but was plenty fresh. A nice spread of red pepper ricotta and olive oil spread came in place of just your typical EVOO.\n\nMozzarella Carrozza [$16 / $15 Total Rewards]\n\nThe fried mozzarella was smaller than they may appear, especially if you consider that each triangle was $8. Enough for four decent bites in sum. Still, they were perfectly and crisply fried, housing undeniably fresh mozzarella within. A pat of simply sweet and slightly tangy marinara accompanied the mozzarella.\n\nTaglioline with Peas & Ham [$30 / $29 Total Rewards] \nFresh made pasta, prosciutto cotto, sweet peas, light Parmesan cream sauce \n\nThe GF went with the taglioline pasta, which was nicely al dente and fresh. The light Parmesan cream sauce was sweeter than expected, with what seemed to be the essence of corn. The cooked prosciutto provided light heft to each bite, though I think pancetta may have been better served to counter the sweetness of the peas. Still, it helped to make each bite not overly heavy for a cream-based pasta dish. \n\nUncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken [$30 / $29 Total Rewards] \nCharcoal broiled, bone-in chicken, Uncle Vincent's famous lemon sauce \n\nI went with the famed lemon chicken, which featured wonderfully crisp skin and a juicy, moist bird. Keep in mind, there are plenty of bones to pick through with this dish, but hey - that's where the flavor is right? The lemon cannot be denied - sharp and bright.\n\nTraditional Rao's Meatballs [$18 / $17 Total Rewards] \nGround veal, pork, beef, Italian bread crumbs, marinara \n\nYou'd be best served by trying their meatballs. In contrast with the fried mozzarella, these were huge. So big in fact that our party of five went with two orders, but one would have sufficed (that's with the belly of this pig in tow). Extremely moist and well-seasoned, there was also a great char developed on the exterior. Wonderful. \n\nWe were actually in Vegas to celebrate the GF's brother's 21st, so our server, Russ, brought out complimentary tiramisu (light, with great coffee essence), along with his kazoo. A nice touch.\n\nI'm pretty sure the fuss for the Rao's in NYC is more about the exclusivity factor. Sure, the dishes are very good, but there are plenty of great Italian options in the city without having to jump through hoops. That being said, I can see why members would return. So if you're craving quality Italian while in Vegas, I would definitely give the Caesar's outpost a try."

The crazy thing is that I saw the owner, Frank Pellegrino Jr, standing by the wall sipping on some coffee and I walked over and struck up a conversation with him.  I told him I'd seen him on tv a few times.  Frankie is a total class act.  Extremely approachable and grateful.  He thanked me for coming over to talk to him and asked where our party was sitting.  He then added, 'I'd like to buy you all a round.'  He bought us a bottle of wine!  \n\nAside from that really cool experience, we asked Mike, our bartender (really good guy) what he recommended.  \"Without a doubt, you have to have our meatballs, our fried mozzarella and the clams.\"  We ordered one of each and they were really, really good.  \n\nWe wanted to try a main course and split it and Mike recommended his favorite.  He asked us to order the veal parmesan and it really was a wonderful plate.  The size was big enough to feed two if you order an appetizer, say the meatballs to go with it.    \n\nThe ambience is very cool.  It's low lit, I saw a bocce ball court in the back, great music and also the photos of the celebrities on the walls are pretty neat, as well.  \n\nNew York City is pretty far from here and I hear getting a table there can be quite difficult.  So, I'm happy we have a Rao's here in Vegas.  We'll come back for sure."

It was a simple dish, but the sauce was just perfect! My dining companions all favored this dish as well out of our particular selections, but they did enjoy their own entrees very much to say the least.

The ultimate expression of what many have come to know as Italian or rather I-talian (emphasis on the I and meaning no disrespect) food in the US.  It's origins in Naples, but long since corrupted for American taste and bounty.  The Italian spirit and passion for sharing good food lives on.\n\nRao's is a fun place to mangia!  Example one, ginormous meatballs the size of your fist.  Flavorful, Perfectly cooked, tender, balls bathed in a hearty red sauce.  A great blend of fatty beef, pork, and lean veal the right amount of breadcrumb filler.  Example two, spaghetti alla Bolognese, a pile of noodles hidden under a thick meaty, flavor charged sauce.\n\nClassic starters.  Baked clams, rich with butter and crisp breadcrumbs, dried herbs and a kiss of lemon; the fritto misto (calamari, shrimp, cod, and zucchini) a slightly crisp, slightly oily, aggressively seasoned; the saut\u00e9ed mussels, sweet and tender saut\u00e9ed in butter then quickly steamed in white wine and garlic.  No complaints.\n\nClassic mains.  Outstanding veal chop served smothered with Rao's classic sauce of mildly spicy, sweet cherry peppers.  Subtle flavor of tender veal along side the clean, pepper flavor and zesty tomato sauce.  It heightens the sweetness of the veal.  Win!  Veal not your thing?   The same sauce tops a tender grilled shell steak (Steak Pizzaiola) and a thick, juicy, double cut pork chop.  The Ossobuco, delicious.  Well braised, tender without being stringy.  A good portion of bone marrow a nice touch.  Finally \"Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken; charbroiled marinated in a lemon olive oil mixture and finished in the same.  Tart, sweet, bitter, classic.\n\nPortions are large.  \n\nVery good wine list focusing on Italy.  Typical high Vegas resort pricing.\n\nService is very friendly and efficient.  Exactly what you would expect from an I-talian restaurant from NYC.  Well done."

That was not the case here, the huge shaves of parmesan cheese, delicious crispy croutons and fresh tasty dressing made this salad a memorable one. \n\nThank you Rao's, your comfy chair and no nonsense lunch menu saved my tummy!"

The only interest she held was sneezing into her hands and then touching our glasses and plates.  NO charisma, no class and they weren't working to please their customers at all.   \n\nThe restaurant is uncomfortable.   We were led down the stairs to an area that looks out to the pool.   The front of the restaurant that had cozy looking booths and intimate table were passed up and we were placed in the middle of the walk way between the kitchen/service area and other tables!!    There were people constantly brushing up against our backs and the seats are very small and have very little butt space.   The pad of the chair is short and narrow.   The odd thing is, there weren't any customers we when came in the front part of the restaurant, so they could have sat us there.  Also, the sun was beating down on us and there wasn't any shade given so we had to eat with the sun in our eyes.   This has been hands down the most uncomfortable restaurant experience in Las Vegas so far.     The atmosphere distracted us from the food and dining experience.\n\nLastly, the dessert menu was unimpressive.    Standard Italian desserts.  This place has great food but lousy service and ambience, which will turn people away."

My wife ordered the Chicken Scarpariello.  We were pre-warned that the chicken came on the bone which meant we would have to \"work for it\", which is a very nice way of making sure the dish doesn't come back for not being a chicken breast.  The dish was huge, and looked great, but was overpowered by the taste taste of the hot peppers, like someone had dumped a bottle of Gardinar juice on top of the whole thing.\n\nMy Osso bucco was amazing however and more than made up for her dish.  It was one of those dishes that was so good you are almost hesitant to order it again for fear that it wouldn't live up to the first time you had it.\n\nI took one star off for the chicken dish and because our table was seated right next to the bar.  We were so close that we kept getting bumped into.  The table was also so small we were obliged send our bread dish away to make room for the main course.  \n\nPrice wise this was a pretty good, $150 for app, two dinners, a drink and a half a bottle of wine.  \n\nOur server was very cordial and pleasant.  I had not problems leaving a 20% tip on the bill."

She is less than adventurous when it comes to food so Italian seemed like a safe bet for dinner for the two of us.\n\nFor some reason, I find it difficult to find baked clams in LA and they were a favorite of mine growing up in NY so my friend and I decided to split an order.  They came out piping hot, the breading was plentiful and perfectly seasoned and the ratio of breading to clam was spot on.  A squirt of lemon and I was in heaven.\n\nWe didn't want to stuff ourselves before going out for the night and I wanted something simple so I ordered the spaghetti marinara (something I would normally NEVER order out), a side of meatballs to split with my friend and I had a glass of wine to wash it all down.\n\nThe pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was well balanced, sweet and just a little tangy and the meatballs were everything that everyone makes them out to be.  They are just dense enough not to crumble when you cut into it with your fork and tender enough that they still practically melt in your mouth.  Truly divine.  \n\nThe portions were HUGE.  I had half of my pasta and half of a meatball left over at the end of the meal.  It's a good thing though because for what they charge, I might have been LIVID if I wasn't MORE than stuffed.  Our waiter convinced us to take our food back to our hotel (even though we didnt have a microwave) and I'll admit, after a long drunk night out, it tasted just as good cold as it did when it was hot and at least I felt like I got my moneys worth and didn't have to eat at McDonalds at 3am.  At least not on that night."

Seemed foolish to pass on the opportunity to eat at the same restaurant in Vegas since the one in NYC will likely never happen. \n\nWe were able to get last minute reservations on a Thursday for 9:30. Restaurant has a very cool feel to it, kinda like something out of an old school Italian mob movie. \n\nBread basket - surprisingly enjoyable. What really makes this is the free different types of butter served with the bread. Don't ask me what they are; no one told us. \n\nMeatballs - these were highly recommended  by our waiter; he said they always sell out of these. 15 minutes prior to closing, they still had them. When I think of excellent meatballs, I think of places like Lavo or Carbone where the meatball is full of texture and you can plainly see and taste the different meats. This was more of a uniform, over mixed meatball. It's fine, but nothing to wax poetic about. The meatballs at Lavo are. \n\nFrito misto - so, so, so much food. This could easily serve five people comfortably, and really was good. The calamari was super, super tender, as was the shrimp. This was one of the two dishes that truly excelled. \n\nMozzarella Carrozza - this is basically a giant mozzarella stick. It's good, for what it is, but let's be honest about what it is. Again, it's fine, but nothing that special. \n\nPastas had a cool presentation factor, and were brought to you table side in stainless steel pots and mixed there, then served. \n\nPenne Vodka - this is excellent. Pasta tastes fresh with a nice chew factor and the sauce is rich and creamy. \n\nLinguini and Clams - there is no reason to order this. Seriously. It is spaghetti and clams with basically no real flavor. Resist temptation and skip this. We barely are it and didn't bother to bring it home. \n\nVeal Parm - the other dish that the waiter said they always run out of was also still available at 9:45. The only thing that really distinguished this veal park from most every other one I've ever had was that it comes on the bone. Like the meatball, it's fine, but nothing you could have and call life changing. \n\nThe biggest thing this place has going for it is the novelty of what it is, and the allure to anyone from NYC that you can actually get in here. It's more less standard, expensive Italian food. If you are really dying to try Rao's in NYC and can't, coming here will satisfy the urge and make you feel like you didn't really miss out if this is the same as the original."

Since good service is much more difficult to find than good food I finally decided to give it a Yelp rating of 4 stars. But I had to think about it for a while. \n\nActually, I would nearly give it a 5 star rating for service. The staff was unerringly friendly and helpful, and we only had to wait a few extra minutes for our table even though the person who had taken our reservation had failed to note that the leader of our party had requested a prime window seat (which we received, by the way) when taking the reservation. Our waiter met my acid test for service: to wit, after we had received our beverage or food for each round of service (i.e., cocktails, appetizers, main course, etc.) he would stand close by and watch for us to finish or call for him. I had only to look over my shoulder and he would be at my side, awaiting instruction. The service lacked only that extra, almost extrasensory anticipation of need that is the hallmark of a truly great dining experience worthy of 5 stars. \n\nWe ordered several appetizers to share. The Mozzarella in Carozza was nice but nothing to write home about. The Fritto Misto di Mare was quite pedestrian. The grilled octopus with broccoli raabi was tasty and nicely cooked, but could have been better seasoned. It was, however, accompanied by some very tasty braised cipollini onions. We also shared a Caesar salad which was . . . how can I put this . . . just a Caesar salad. \n\nI had the grilled lamb chops as a main course (can't remember the Italian name). They were perfectly cooked (I told the waiter to leave the degree of doneness up to the chef, and he did a good job), the meat was of a good quality and presented in a very nice balsamic vinegar reduction, but the accompanying roasted potatoes were pretty nondescript. Our hostess had risotto with shrimp, which was perfectly cooked though unimaginatively seasoned. My friend and his wife split the Salsa alla Marinara and an order of meatballs, subsequently expressing bitter disappointment. The sauce for the pasta was quite average, and the meatballs, while of a nice consistency and heft, were rather bland. \n\nWe were quite full by the end of the entrees, and ordered no desserts. \n\nThe overall ambiance is simple but attractive. I can think of any number of places I have been to that are just as nice. \n\nThe bottom line is that if you come to Rao's expecting a transcendent dining experience, you are bound to be disappointed. Whereas a great deal of the allure of the original Rao's lies in the insane difficulty in getting a table there in the first place, the food at the Rao's in Las Vegas is just of slightly-better-than-any-other-red-sauce-Italian-restaurant quality. Accept this fact, enjoy the ambiance and the service, and you'll have a great time. Expect any more, and prepare to face the awful truth that is dining on The Strip."

Little did we know what offense we had committed by being ever so slightly hungry ever so slightly too early. \n\nWe dropped by Rao's about a half hour before they opened and inquired as to when they were opening for the night.

Take a seat and I'll get you a couple of menus. And right as we were about to sit down a lovely curve ball. \n\n\"No you can't sit down... I was just messing with you.. leave!\" He started laughing at us and just walked away.

We ended up ordering the shell pasta with ricotta and the shrimp fra diavolo. The shell pasta was not cooked properly, they were very hard. The diavolo sauce was good and spicy but the shrimp was chewy and gross. Also, our waiter wasn't attentive of us like he was to other tables surrounding us.

After hearing how hard it is to get into the original restaurant in NYC (there's only 8 tables, and you need to know someone who knows someone - you get the point), we decided that we would get a taste of Italy in Las Vegas.\n\nThe dinner was a Pre-Fixe Menu that had 3 choices of appetizers, pasta, meat, and dessert for $160 - it also came with a glass of Champagne or a Bellini. I chose the Caprese Salad, Risotto with fresh veggies, Surf and Turf (9 oz filet and 7 oz lobster tail), and we all shared the 3 desserts (the best was the tiramisu).\n\nThe wait staff was superb, and the meal was very good - but as with most Italian restaurants, there was a LOT of food.  After the salad and risotto, I was already starting to get full, then the main courses came, and they were delicious, but about half way through, I was done.  My wife had the Ossobuco, which was amazing, and super tender.  When dessert was being served, we all needed espresso to kick us out of a food coma, and get us ready for the rest of the night...\n\nThe best part of the evening was that Frank Peligrino (the owner - also a star in The Sopranos) was there, and we took photos - he also sang in the Live Band that played from 10 until we brought in the New Year.  Most of the crowd in the restaurant wandered out to the private patio and watched the fireworks display over the Strip - it was awesome, and very LOUD, as the explosions echoed off the buildings at Caesar's Palace.\n\nOverall, it was a great night, and if I had a bigger appetite, then I would have rated the entire experience 5-stars!"

We were seated on time and the first thing I asked for was a drink.  Well, to start off that drink was strong so I thought that this may actually work out well.  We ordered our appetizers and enjoyed them as they were cooked well.  It was nothing special just a caprese salad and some cheesesticks for the others.  We ordered our main course and everyone enjoyed their food.  Was it the best food we have ever, EVER had - no, but it was still delicious and it was piping hot.  The signature lasagna, the rigatoni, and....I actually completely forgot about the others and what they got but I do remember everyone enjoying their meal and saying they should've done without the appetizers.

            "review": "We called and were told the ONLY reservations available were at 5:00 - fine, we were on East Coast time, felt like 8:00 to us.  When myself and a co-worker arrived at at 4:59 (told over the phone if we were late or no showed, they would charge our card $50) there was no one at the hostess stand to greet us.  Had to wander to the bar to announce our arrival ---- only to find that the 2 young ladies sitting with the 2 older men RIGHT NEXT TO THE HOSTESS STAND were actually the hostesses who should have greeted and seated us.  Owners, if you are reading this, NOT THE WAY TO START A MEAL FOR 2 FOR OVER $150 - work it out.  Stay off TV and fix this.  I can't overlook this, hire better.  Unless you can back it up at the end, start strong.\n\nOnce seated our waiter was knowledgeable and reasonably accommodating but we felt so rushed.  Everything we ordered arrived within 5 minutes...just as quickly we were asked if they could take FULL plates.  NO - go away.  The waiter also sat on chairs that were weirdly blocking access to our booth - I expect Hooters waitresses to sit at my table, not Rao's waiters.\n\nStarted with the antipasta appetizer for 2 - amazing,  Also ordered the Meatball side dish, they were fine, I truly make better, I also serve mine hot.  The Pasta with Vodka sauce was simply amazing.  Also had an order of the Fussilli with spicy sausage and cabbage - the pasta was perfect, the cabbage was a good addition - the sausage was over cooked, just short of burned, the sauce was acceptable, bordering on too acidic.\n\nWhen leaving, I was put off that the only res was at 5:00, we felt rushed and left at 7:00 to an almost empty restaurant.  Should I ever have the option to try the Harlem version, I would be hard pressed to say yes, sorry.  Work is needed."

Can't begin to describe the flavour and excellence of these dishes.  Truley awesome.\n\nWe went on to share penne alla vodka and the risotto.  The penne were fantastic and risotto, while it was very good, too much mushrooms in our opinion.  It was good but risotto should not be overpowered by the additions.  Still very good.\n\nStrongly recommend the experience!!!!1"

I might never get a chance to try those legendary meatballs in NYC, so this could be my only chance. \n\nAlright, ordered two meatballs as an appetizer, with Penne alla Vodka as the main course. The meal came with rather plain jane bread that was good and fresh, but nothing spectacular. \n\nSo, the meatballs are about 5oz each and are covered in a thinly sweet Marinara sauce, sans any pasta. Real Italian Polpettine, perhaps a little too large for Napoli but delicious & soft while retaining an exterior form that prevents them from mushing. I tasted beef, pork, and veal, with parsley and garlic. Yum yum. Oh so yum yum!\n\nAh, the Penne alla Vodka? Now, it was served while I was still chowing on the meatballs (haha--did I write that?), and that is a faux pax of serving but I forgive them. Now, the sauce was a little too thick for my taste; I think a loosening of some starchy pasta water would have helped. But it was deliciously creamy, with a nice pepper bite to it, and a delicate balance of pancetta and garlic. The graininess from the vodka was perceptible, but not overwhelming. \n\nWell-done."

And, it was OK, but I'm still a little upset about my $36 shrimp fra diavolo WITH NO PASTA and only 5 shrimp. It wasn't special enough for that price. To be completely honest, I'm also still upset about my teeny tiny escarole and bean soup that cost $15. Don't get me wrong: I get it. Restaurants are expensive and even moreso in Las Vegas but I have issues paying this much for traditional Italian-American cuisine. I'll stick to my local places in the future and skip this one. There are MUCH better places in Vegas where I'd choose to drop my cash."

We left the restaurant with full stomachs unable to eat dessert which is unheard of for us..anyways im definitely coming back for sure. \n\nThe only thing i was gripe about is the info shows casual attire..well casual to me is just that casual..i went with jeans and nice shirt and shoes and my hat..they asked me to take off my hat at the dinner table which i dont mind doing ..but dont say its casual attire then. i say it should have a classy title than casual"

They definitely know their stuff and will tell you what they like or what is popular.  Overall, it is like working together to create a great meal experience.\n\nStarters- Not bad at all. Not a 5 but not a 3 either. 3.75!\n\na.  Meatballs - There were five of us and we actually ordered 3 meatballs to split. They are rather large, larger than you anticipate so this was perfect.\n\nb.

The sausage and the cabbage make for a nice mix.\n\nc. Antipasto Della Casa - Very nice. Besides all the normal meats, cheese, peppers, tomatoes and olives, they also give you gran padano cheese. It is my favorite...\n\nd.  Roasted Peppers - Very nice with pine nuts!\n\nMain Entree -  We shared three meat dishes and it was plenty\n\na.  Grilled Lamb chops - Awesome and especially on the bone. So tasty!\n\nb.  Osso Bucco - Huge shank and that means a lot of bone marrow to dig out.  Yum Yum for those that like the marrow!\n\nc.  Veal Parmasan - Nice and tender.  It was pretty good.  \n\nOverall the Osso Bucco and Lamb Chops were great, the Antipasto and the meatballs were awesome and everything else was pretty good.\n\nGK says check it out.

There are standing reservations so don't even try.  \n\nUntil now.  Rao's LV is owned and operated by members of the family who own Rao's NYC.  The LV restaurant is much larger than the one in NYC.  There are even two rooms which are exact replicas of the NYC restaurant, right down to the autographed photos of celebrities who have had the fortune to dine at the original location.  \n\nI've been to Rao's LV multiple times, and each time I love it.  We always receive fabulous service and delicious old-school Italian cuisine.  This place is the kind of restaurant where even your Nonni (Italian grandmother) would feel like she was dining at the home of a fellow Italian family.  Seriously.\n\nIt is that good.

He's a frequent visitor to Vegas so he has been to most of the good ones on the strip (thanks to me! ha!).  Throw in Restaurant Week and a lack of last minute tables available at 9pm on a Saturday and I was back at Rao's for the first time in 6 years.  \n\nI wanted to dine in the Christmas room again but there was a wait so we just opted for the lower floor area facing the pool.  We ordered a plate of antipasto (prosciutto di parma, mild sopresata, marinated artichokes, gaeta olives, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, grana padano, gorgonzola cheese, dressed arugula) to kick things off and that was very good.  Everything was fresh and that was a nice substitute instead of four people getting individual salads.\n\nThe osso bucco was literally calling my name right off the page but I figured I could come back for that any other time of the year.  I decided to take advantage of the great value of Restaurant Week and use the couple of bucks saved on drinking more wine.  \n\nThe appetizer was \"Mozzarella in Carrozza\" which was described as fried fresh mozzarella sandwich served with marinara.  In reality it was 2 HUGE wedges of deep fried breaded mozzarella.  So unhealthy yet so delicious.  Fried cheese has never tasted bad...ever.\n\nThere were four options for the main course but since everyone else was getting pasta (scampi, spaghetti and meatballs, shells) I decided on the pork chop and MAN OH MAN was that a solid choice.  It was a double cut of pork that was pan seared and sauteed with hot and sweet cherry peppers.  It was juicy, spicy, well seasoned and I ended up gnawing on the bones at the end like a dog.  \n\nI took only one bite of the tiramisu since I was so full and my wife ate the rest of it.  \n\nThere are so, so, so many Italian options around these days (and better values to be had) but I wouldn't mind splurging a little more for this gem a few times a year."

My boss is a huge wine snob so our group generally goes through a half dozen bottles at dinner -- I must recommend Rao's Sicilian reds which are tremendous.  Ask your server for a Sicilian that will cater to your tastes.  All of them are excellent.\n\nThe restaurant, itself, is somewhat interesting.  The decorations are on par with other traditional Italian sit-down places.  A 360 bar serves as the restaurant's center hub, and various large rooms shoot off of this area.  There is a fake outdoor area by the entrance, which is next to a fountain inside Caesars Palace.  This area can get pretty loud so I would recommend against sitting here.  Alternatively, there is a real outdoor area which faces Caesars' pool.  The pool closes relatively early so there won't be much noise from there but you will get some residual sound from the Strip's traffic.\n\nOverall, this is a nice place for a nice dinner.

The giant meatball side (you get 2) could be it's own meal.  Topped with some Parmesan cheese, the meatballs are excellent.  We also got a special - a linguini pasta with crab and a light fettucini/olive oil sauce.  The clams as well were delicious - a little on the smaller side but full of flavor and baked to perfection.  The food amount for the most part nearly worked out too - hitting the middle ground for a good-sized portion for sharing or eating alone.  Additionally, you get a bunch of different types of bread like olive bread to a cracker that you can dip in your own olive oil/balsamic vinaigrette!  We ended the meal with profiteroles that were drenched in chocolate sauce - it was a great finish.\n\nThe price for all of these dishes ended up about $50 per person - not too shabby when you think about the amount of food we were hitting up.  The server was super super friendly and the staff were diligent about refilling water and taking away plates after they were done.  The seating we had was nice as well - right by the pool that in the Winter was closed and made for a nice, serene view.  Seating seems pretty plentiful as well as a nice middle circle bar.  To find Rao's, it'll be deeper into the Casino by the Bacchanal and a sushi stand (as well as a dessert place across the way).   \n\nRao's isn't the best Italian I've ever bad but it sure is plentiful and tasty enough to just make you enjoy yourself in Vegas.  The prices aren't exorbitant and you feel like you're being treated well.  If you're looking for Italian and a nice place on the Strip, Rao's is solid all-around."

Onions sweet with just enough bite to them to round out the dish.\n\nThe service was fast, staff friendly, and food great.  I did get sick later that night and can't for sure say it was the food, the recent flight, or just happen stance.  But on another trip I would eat at Raos again."

The service was excellent, the food was fantastic - one friend had the spinach ravioli special, another had the Pollo Scarpariello with special requests, my husband had the Gnocchi alla Bolognese, and I had the Vitello alla Parmigiana. We all split a side of meatballs, and there were plenty to go around.\n\nI haven't had food like this in years. The meatballs alone rivaled my Italian grandmother's, and everything else was fantastic. We will definitely be back."

I got the lasagna and my lady got the ravioli purses, along with a massive salad (which can be easily split between two people) which collectively made for a perfect meal. Even before the meal itself was served, our server recommended several wines, and the additional bread came with a variety of butter spreads and extra virgin olive oil. \n\nFrom start to do ish, everything was flawless, even the photos after dinner provided by the kind staff.

The rib eye my husband ordered was cold, not room temp but ice cold, no au jus either, (seriously) so thin and filled with fat that by the time we could see the steak it might have been the size of your palm. The sommelier was not happy (AND showed it) how rude of us that we did not order wine!.. we were having cocktails! He quickly turned around showing us his disdain with a sour look. The little lamp on the famous 'jar', was totally torn to pieces, the waiter was clueless. The table was way too tight for a party of 4, I felt I was at a taco bell, the tables that are inside the booths have no space at all, and the restaurant was not full.  They could have given us a better seating area. The person that showed us to our table was not happy that we requested another spot, so then she placed us in a worse location. This was 12/26/16 I felt bad because my sister paid for this outrageously expensive dinner (reminded me of buca di beppo) which I was invited once, saw the food, tasted something filled with red sauce and left.  Nothing was notable, not a thing, not the heavy handed sauce on my pasta, nor my nephew's seafood salad that was the size of a tapas dish.  I was wondering about the food in this place...how come I had better food in a smaller unknown restaurants in Rome/Venice/Capri/and Florence? And also here in the US!  What a shame."

And while their line of products is truly 5 star, I'm happy to say their restaurant (located in Caesar's Palace, across from the buffet) is also a culinary delight.\n\nAn offshoot of their main NYC-based location, the Rao's in Vegas is not a disappointment.  While a tad bit pricey, I think you'll find this place is worth your dollar, as the pizza is fantastic, as are the delicious salads, and of course the meatball is something that must be tried at least once in your life.\n\nFor those of you on the west coast, a drive to Vegas sure beats a flight to NY, so save yourself the trip and try the Vegas Rao's, if you'd like a little taste of that authentic NYC Italian fare.  \n\nPro-tip:  Order the meatball with a marinara-based pasta dish.  Combine the two for a giant meal that will feed a couple people for a reasonable price!"

With that said, I decided to try the next best thing: a dinner reservation at Rao's, inside of Caesars Palace.\n\nOur group of 6 got a dinner reservation via OpenTable for July 4th. While the ambience & atmosphere of Rao's was very warm and welcoming, the food didn't blow me away like what I thought it would. The Chicken Caesar salad lacked originality and for almost $20, looked like one of those salads found in the MDR on a Norweigan Cruise Line. I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Bolognese. While the dish tasted fine (almost like Olive Garden quality), nor my nose or mouth was tantalized by the lukewarm dish that was served.\n\nI loved the interior decorations of the place and even the red door entrance looks like the mother ship restaurant in New York. Sadly I was disappointed by the food here, especially when I had ultra-high expectations for a chapter of Rao's. While I will hold out hope that someday I will receive that exclusive invitation to eat at Rao's in New York, I will avoid this Las Vegas location for the near future."

While entering the decor is nice and sets a good mood. I started with a strawberry spiritz which was okay. Pretty basic drink it had strawberries, vodka, lemon sour and sparking soda. My boyfriend and I split the caprese salad and it was so good. The tomatoes were very fresh and cheese was so rich and creamy. For our main course I got the stuffed ricotta shells. They were cooked to a perfect al dente. The tomato ricotta sauce had just the right amount of acidity and creamy texture. For dessert I ordered the tiramisu. It was near perfection. The coffee flavor was prevalent but not over powering. The mascarpone cream was so silky smooth. The whole bite was just perfect. All the flavors meddled together harmoniously. \n\nWith all that being said and the food being absolutely perfect the reason for the two stars was unfortunately due to the service. The service here was sub par at best. I know being young and being a waitress myself I understand the stigma with young people and how they do not tip a lot. With that being said I try to be mindful and try to tip well to break the stigma. Unfortunately this stereotype may have gotten to our waitress Angela. She was nice and sure she means well but she never checked in on us. She never checked if I liked my drink, she did not ask about our caprese or even our main course. The drink and appetizer I understand but not checking in on ones main course is something I find unacceptable. She would have gotten a nice tip if she had only checked on us. She managed to check on her other three tables right next to us multiple times but failed to even see how we were doing. Very disappointed how she could let our young appearance get to her. If we are dining at Raos and ordering drinks then we obviously have money. Too bad the service really lacked because the food was top notch."

Chicken parm was just alright. The sauce in the jar tastes better than this sauce. Lobster and shrimp pasta was tasty, as well as, the shrimp scampi.

Actually, I think I would have preferred sitting there to the main area (or the \"outside\"); our meal was served more quickly and was way more low-key. I had the salmon pasta which was deliciously fishy and flavorful. My husband pasta with clams which was also excellent. Sure it was pricey, but it is Vegas, and it was so worth it."

The beet salad was fine (although it was weird that it almost had no beets), so was the spaghetti bolognese. The real reason to go are the meatballs, which are great, but almost an afterthought at the end of the menu. It's too bad they aren't open for lunch anymore, just to get a meatball sandwich. And I ordered the cannoli just to taste what a $14 cannoli tastes like. And, well, it tastes like a $3 cannoli.  \n\nOne expects the prices at Vegas's popular spots to be inflated, but, besides the meatballs, this was way too much for decent Italian. $120 for two with one glass of wine. \n\nI would have given it 2.5 stars if I could. This place is mostly hype."

So we continued to ask her, is there anyway you could squeeze us in (yes we were hungry and didn't want to go searching for another place we could all agree on!).

SO why didn't the biatch in the front tell us that? We immediately found a table and sat. I was a little disappointed in the vegetarian options.

The design of Rao's in Las Vegas resembles a steakhouse, a neighborhood bar, and an old family restaurant, with dark cherry walls, white table cloths, signed photographs on the walls, and a gaudy bar awkwardly situated in the middle of the dining space. \n\nThe selection of breads was uninteresting, but leavened by the intensely fruity, clear, beautiful olive oil at the table. The risotto with shrimp was a stellar rendition of the dish, though it released too many droplets of butter in the bowl as we lingered. The shrimp with spicy tomato sauce was visually stunning, with splashes of crimson gracing five gleaming tails, but the seafood was tough and slightly overcooked. And, the housemade sausage, traditionally but nicely seasoned, had a welcome, coarsely ground texture, but could not enliven its accompanying orecchiette and broccoli rabe. \n\nHowever, the service was impeccable, and the wine pours were generous.

But, overall it was more good (or very good) than bad, so here we arrive at a 4 star rating.\n\nWe had reservations for 8 on a Friday.  We arrived promptly and only had to wait a couple of minutes while they set our table up.  We didn't love the placement of our table, it was like it was put in the middle of a dining room as an afterthought.  Not much room to maneuver, and other tables were all on top of us, so we asked to move and were accommodated.  The server brought us water and a wine list.  The wine list is above average for the Strip, and the prices are what you'd expect to pay.  Appropriately, there were several Italian wines on the list.  The somm was great, he came over and offered some assistance and was very friendly.\n\nThe bread service is good, it's served with 3 types of butter.  My favorite was the red pepper.  To start, we had 2 appetizers (baked clams and bruschetta) and two pastas (linguine with white claim sauce and rigatoni filletto).  The appetizers were average, probably one of the least impressive parts of the meal.  The baked clams were mostly bread crumbs, and they were over-salted.  They did have a nice crust on top from the broiler.  The bruschetta was good and fresh, but I could have used more balsamic. It was very basic. \n\nOf the pastas, the linguine was vastly superior.  It was loaded with clams and the white wine sauce was great.  Cooked perfectly as well.  I considered ordering another order of this as a side dish, it was that good.  The rigatoni was too far on the other spectrum of al dente for me.  It had way too much bite.  And, the sauce didn't have the flavors we expected from the menu description:  pancetta, white onion, tomatoes, pecorino romano.  It tasted like a basic tomato sauce, I didn't get any taste of pancetta.  Had the pasta been cooked maybe a minute longer it would have been much better, but I wouldn't get this again.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the veal parm.  But, our group is big on sharing dishes, so I also tried Uncle Vincent's lemon chicken, this chicken dish with peppers and sausage, and the pasta special of the evening, which was lobster and shrimp in a fra diavolo sauce.  We also got an order of meatballs to share.  As many Yelpers note, the meatballs are massive, softball size.  So, 2 of them was plenty for a group of 4, we each probably had nearly a half-pound of meatball to eat.\n\nThe entrees, in my order of preference:  veal parm, chicken with sausage and peppers, Uncle Vincent's, and the seafood pasta.  The veal chop is huge, thin, and breaded well.  You really don't need a knife, I cut it with my fork at least half the time.  It's covered in marinara and cheese.  It certainly isn't re-inventing the wheel, but it's a fantastic version of a classic dish.  The table loved it.\n\nThe chicken and peppers was good, with both being cooked well.  But, the star was the sausage.  Some of the best Italian sausage I can remember having, and it wasn't overcooked, so it retained some juiciness.  I can see why Uncle Vincent's is popular.  The chicken is prepared very well and is juicy.  I'm just not a huge lemon chicken guy, so the dish was lost on me.  But, I was glad to try one of Rao's more famous (which is saying something) dishes.\n\nThe fra diavolo was a miss.  It had no heat at all.  It was a watery tomato sauce with the seafood.  They would have been way better off just using the house marinara.  Very disappointing.  The guy that ordered it picked out all the seafood and then supplemented his dinner with stuff from our plates.  \n\nThe meatballs have earned their reputation.  They are tender, moist, and very flavorful.  Just incredible.  Nothing more needs to be said that hasn't been said in decades about these things.  Just order them when you go, even if you just have a couple of bites.\n\nLike I said, service was spotty.  At one point, we counted during an hour and we saw the somm more than we saw our server.  The restaurant was busy, but I am guessing that a place like Rao's is always busy.  That being said, for the most part the food was very good, and I would eat here again."

Rao's was on that list and I had not been there yet so - OK! We made a reso, no problem and were seated right on time. Nice place (Caesar's Palace and easy to find at the casino exit into the Shops area), the restaurant itself was actually better than the service (think Capone style). I would not call our server unprofessional per se but he had an indescribable edge to him that made us a bit uneasy especially when he would grab a chair and sit with us for a bit?\nThe food was very good. we shared a meatball (to die for, so moist and the marinara sauce divine), and my spouse had the rigatoni with pancetta, onion, tomatoes. The pasta was well cooked and he gave it a 4 out of 5. My linguini with clams was a 5. For me, it is hard for anyone to give me perfect pasta as I am picky and I despise overcooked pasta especially when at a restaurant, you pay a premium for such a cheap dish (for the house). The clams were great, only found 1 broken shell. The garlic wine sauce was fantastic, not too heavy and just enough of it. Well seasoned.\nDrinks were good but pricey.\nI expected the bill to be a bit heftier overall, but we were pleasantly surprised.\nWould I come back here? Vegas is a foodie Mecca and there are just too many other places to go and try so, no.. But I would not dissuade anyone else from coming here for the love of Italian food!"

I made a reservation for 5 PM so I had lots of time for a leisurely meal before the 7:30 show.\n\nI was greeted promptly and taken to a table on the far side of the bar and down a few steps.  It's the last area before you go to their patio.  I had a view of the pool area and one of Caesars iconic Roman statues in a columned structure.\n\nMy server, Howard, quickly appeared and asked for my drink order.  He brought my iced tea quickly.  Having read about the size of Rao's portion, I was careful to choose wisely.  I went with the baked clams for an appetizer and the ravioli purses for the main course.\n\nI was soon brought a nice bread basket.  Howard asked me if I wanted some balsamic with the olive oil and I declined.  I poured some of the oil onto the plate, salted it a bit, and then dipped some of the olive bread that was part of the basket.\n\nWithin a short time, my baked clams were delivered.  They are littleneck clams that had an oregano bread crumb topping.  I squeezed some lemon on the clams and dug in.  It's been a long time since I got baked clams and they were great!  The lemon mixed with the juices from the clams and I had another dipping \"sauce\" for my bread.  Very tasty!\n\nThe main course came. Rao's calls them beggar purse ravioli.  The ravioli were stuffed with a mixture of pear and ricotta cheese and they were in a sauce of brown butter seasoned with sage and topped with dried cranberries.  This caught my eye when I was reading the menu because it was such a different dish.  It was excellent, too!  The pear taste with the cheese was very mild and the butter with the dried cranberries was a true winner!  A good dish that's really different.  Also, I had dipping sauce #3--the brown butter with sage was a wonderful place to dip a few cubes of the good bread.\n\nFor dessert, I asked Howard for his advice.  He gave me a listing of the entire dessert menu without having to bring one to me.  Of the things on the menu, he recommended one, the peanut butter tart, something his wife makes--she's one of the pastry chefs at Rao's.  The tart had a graham cracker crust, a layer of chocolate ganache, and it was topped with peanut butter mousse.  It was superb!  I'll have the other dessert he recommended on my next visit.\n\nThe dinner was very very good!  Service was exemplary.  The staff or Howard was always around to refill water, get more iced tea, remove dirty dishes, and simply to do a great job!  I am a big fan of Rao's."

Some Italian Grandma has made all these dishes for her whole life and has been taught them by her Grandma and will pass them on to her Grandchildren who will all open restaurants in your cities.  They won't charge you an arm and a leg for them and you will eat them all the time.  They will be really good.  So if I walk into an Italian Restaurant in Caesar's Palace where you need a reservation in advance, I'm going to hold them to a higher standard and I'm expecting to be really wowed.  I wasn't, it was just ok.\n\nFor starters we had baked stuffed clams.  These smelled great but the clam was pretty tough to get out of the shell (as clams can be).  The stuffing was way way overdone with fresh oregano.  You could taste nothing else, just oregano bread stuffing. Plus with the clam hanging onto it's shell for dear life, when you scooped out the clam shell, all you got was the stuffing.  The clam was left behind.  2 stars for this appetizer.\n\nMy dish was the best at the table, Ossobucco alla Milanese.  I would give it 4 stars.  It was nice and tender shank of veal cut very thick.  It was served on top of saffron risotto and in a traditional tomato/ vegetable sauce.  There was a small fork placed in the bone marrow for sampling.  I enjoyed the flavor of the bone marrow, but I'm not a fan of the texture of it.  If you eat at Rao's, I would recommend this dish.  \n\nMy brother got a beautiful looking Veal Parmesan.  This was served bone in and was impressive to look at as it covered the entire large plate.  Unfortunately it's flavor didn't match it's looks.  It was also tough.  Not terrible, but not great either...3 stars.  \n\nMy wife had Ricotta Purses with Sage and Butter.  Although the pasta was cooked nicely, the ricotta cheese was kind of sweet and somehow the sage butter lacked the savory element to offset it.  Just recently we had a similar ravioli style sage butter sauce dish at Angelini Osteria in Hollywood, CA.  That dish was so magical, but this one was very blah.  Again 3 stars.  \n\nOne other strange bit of info is that Rao's is decorated for Christmas year round.  I asked about this and was told that at the original Rao's in New York, they never got around to taking the Christmas decorations down one year, so it became a joke that they would just leave them up.  When they opened this Las Vegas location, they kept that tradition.\n\nSo there you go, as with most restaurants on the strip, Rao's is 3 star food at 5 star prices."

The food was dangerously delicious. I went with the stuffed shells and was in pasta heaven.

Two of the dishes were quite tasty - pasta with clams and the pasta with peas and prosciutto.  Probably the best part of the whole experience was watching the server transfer the pasta from the serving dish to the plate... table-side.  Fun!\n\nThings to mention where improvement should be considered:\n\n1.  Serving chicken on the bone.  The Chicken Scarpiello was tasty but hacking the meat off of bones was a bit too \"home-style\" for me.  At home that would be fine but not in a restaurant at those prices.  Small pieces of bone had to be carefully dealt with.  I really worried about getting one lodged in my throat since several somehow made it off of the plate and didn't get noticed until it was chewed.  (I hate spitting out food -- even discretely into a napkin -- while dining in public.\n\n2.  The sausage -- yuck: dry, mealy, some \"carmelized\" beyond the carmel stage, and generally tasteless.  A real disappointment.  AVOID!\n\n3.  Dessert prices.  Twelve bucks for a piece of cheesecake or cannoli.  They were tasty but not worth the price.  Next time we'll walk across the hall and have a $7 Payard pastry!\n\nNow that we've experienced part of the menu I think we are in a better position to make better choices next time."

The oysters were delicious but the star of the appetizers was the meatball. It was light and had a great blended taste of pork beef and veal and a great red sauce. The seafood was a mix of shrimp pieces, crab which was not jumbo lump and calamari. It was served cold but did have a nice flavor to it.\n\nOur server was great and made a lot of recommendations and accommodated all of our needs. He even suggested we do more of a family-style with our party so we all got taste of the food.\n\nWe had the also buchu linguine with White clam sauce ravioli. My favorite was the ravioli.\n\nThe wine selections we made were out of this world but at that caliber of a restaurant I would've expected the sommelier to have a little better pouring technique. I only noticed because he reached across me to pour to the person sitting to the next to me rather than walk around.

But grading on a price to dining experience ratio, not so much.  Look, I know that every restaurant at Caesar's Palace is overpriced, and I'm perfectly willing to overpay for a great dinner, but this was overpaying for a mediocre dinner.\n\nWe started with Frito Misto for the table.  A couple of bites convinced me to save my appetite for the next course.  It's not that it was bland.  It had flavor.  It's just that it had flavors I didn't care for.  So on to the first course special - Pasta Fagioli.  Dean Martin claims that this dish should make me drool like I'm in love, but it was pretty much just a bowl of soup.  My main course was the bone-in veal parm, which was huge.  That made it a bit of a waste, since I left most of it on the plate, and declined an offer to take the rest home in a doggy bag.  I knew I could whip up something for tomorrow night's dinner that would taste much better.   I also had a side of Quattro Fromagi pasta - large pasta shells with no noticeable cheese flavor and, come to think of it, no particular flavor at all.\n\nIn short, I just wasn't impressed. Neither was the rest of our table.  My wife had a pasta dish, which she described as \"acceptable.\"  One of our friends had chicken, which he called \"a waste.\"  Our other friend had a steak, on which he didn't comment.\n\nThe room was a bit cramped.  The walls were completely covered with photographs of people who, I guess, you had to be a New Yorker to recognize.  I certainly didn't.  Service was attentive, but a bit rushed.  The goal seemed to be quick turnaround of the table, rather than facilitating a relaxing dining experience.\n\nSo the whole thing was disappointing.  If my veal parm had cost $22, I probably wouldn't have minded leaving most of it on the plate.  But at $53 I expected something top notch.  This wasn't it.  My suggestion:  If you want a high-end and fairly priced Italian meal, go a mile off the strip to Piero's Italian Cuisine."

You get the crunchy crispy outside contrasting with a tender juicy inside of both breast meat and thigh meat. Each order uses Half a chicken. Their chicken is bigger then a Cornish game hen but much smaller than a supermarket chicken. The small size allows for fast cooking to the inside to the bone without raw pink spots near the bone and still maintaining the crispy outside without burning. Almost impossible to replicate at home consistently. You have to control the grilling temperature with the size of the meat. The sauce is not sweet. Tangy. They don't use sugar as a short cut to carmelization. When served you can smell the vinegar evaporating. As the dish ages the tangy flavor changes to the subtle tartness of aging lemon. Very delicate. You have to experience this. The lemon chicken in the first minute is different than what it evolves to 10 minutes later. No fat. Not greasy. The big supermarket chickens are higher in cholesterol. Completely different texture and flavor"

The menu is designed for you go with a group and eat family-style.\n\nFor our First Course we had the Fritto Misto which was a pile of battered and deep fried shredded zucchini, calamari, and a few pieces of shrimp and cod served with marinara and tarter sauces.  It was a large appetizer which could easily be shared between 5-6 people, but it was nothing special.  A bit greasy, a bit bland, I didn't want any more after a few bites.\n\nFor our Second Course we had the Penne Vodka.  The penne was pretty al dente, probably the least cooked you could eat pasta without complaining it was still raw.  The pink prosciutto, tomato-cream sauce was tasty.  Portion wise this could have easily been split by 3-4 as a first entree.\n\nFor our Third Course we had the Ossobuco, a huge veal shank with saffron risotto.  The veal wasn't as tender as I would have hoped, it didn't fall off the bone and wasn't deep and rich in flavor.  I couldn't taste the saffron in the risotto and it was wet in texture from the veal jus poured over it.  As a second entree, this could have been shared by 3-4.  For a Side, we ordered the Rao's Meatball which was tender and moist, but a bit bland, and big enough for 4 to share.\n\nWe skipped the Fourth Course, dessert, because we were full and with three lack-luster courses under our belts decided we were done.\n\nFor 2 people, without drinks, our meal was $158.00, and the leftovers we took home could have easily fed 2 more.  For the price, there are definitely better eats in Vegas.\n\nIf you do want to try Rao's, come with a group to help you eat the volume of food and spread out the cost."

Because they have one of the best meatball dishes I've ever eaten in Las Vegas, but also because this review is a little different from other reviews I've done because I'm actually taking into account a bit of rare service.\n\nA RARE CASE OF GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE\nI wasn't feeling hungry earlier today despite the fact that I had a reservation at Rao's - the Italian restaurant at Caesar's Palace.  Rao's is purported to have one of the best meatballs in all of Las Vegas so of course I had to try it.  The problem is, I don't think you can really can't rate food if you're completely full.  So I cancelled the reservation and headed off to my evening show. (Penn & Teller)  After the show, I headed straight to Caesars intending on eating dinner by racing over to Rao's.\n...It was just under 11PM and I ran up to the maitre d' huffing & puffing and said, \"I MADE IT!  You're still open right?  I'm dying for some meatballs.\"  She said, \"Yes, we're open for the bar, but not for food.\"  I said, \"What?\"  She said, \"The kitchen closes at 10:30PM!\"  I suddenly frowned, became despondent - rolled my eyes and slowly turned around.\"\n...Suddenly the girl said, \"Wait.  Hold on.\"  I stopped, and she gestured to come in, and so I did.  She said, \"ONE dish, right?\"  I said, \"Yeah.  Just the meatballs.  That's it.\"  She said, \"Hold on - I'm going to ask the kitchen if they'll prepare just that dish.\"  She was gone for awhile but when she came back she said, \"They're going to take care of you.  One dish of meatballs.\"  She turned to the bartender, where I was sitting by then, and said, \"The kitchen said it's okay - one dish of meatballs.\"  The Bartender said, \"Cool.\"  Needless to say, I tipped her $10 as she left.  \n\nTHE MEATBALLS\nAnd sure enough, when the meatballs arrived, they were steaming hot, smothered in licktastic ally delicious marinara.  (Really - I ache for that marinara... it's so tasty!) The bartender came and put fresh aromatic parmesan cheese all over it that smelled heavenly and to me, marked the beginning of a fantastic meal.  Folks - any time your head swoons when you smell your meal, you know you're off to a good start.\n...Taste & texture wise, the meatballs were moist & juicy.  It had good substance and you could tell it was cooked right.  If I had one criticism it would be that I personally could have used a little more sausage in the meat but overall it was a very good meatball.  What took it to the next level really were the parmesan and the marinara.  These folks at Rao's know they're frickin' marinara and cheese for certain.  I licked the plate up and left nothing to wash off.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe food is the most important part but the service is what gets them to the \"I-will-definitely-return\" level.  The only reason I haven't cranked this to 5-stars is because I think I need to eat their Lasagna, their Spaghetti, and if they have it, Cannaloni, to give it a more thorough review.\n\n4 1/2-stars."

Not much went into each dish and made it memorable.  We tried a bunch of options including the veal parmesan, chicken parmesan, seafood pasta, ravioli pouches, simple angel hair, and some meatballs.  Raviolis were interesting, filled with fruit, but seemed more of an appetizer.  Their notorious meatballs were great and very big, but again an appetizer which isn't supposed to be the highlight of the meal in my opinion.  The rest of the pasta dishes were fine but not spectacular which I would expect when paying $40+ per dish.  Wine menu and service were great but I still felt unimpressed as I walked out after the meal.  I was full and ate quality Italian, but at a place like that I expected to be transported to New York and I didn't feel that way after paying the bill."

As soon as we checked in with the hostess, she said it'll be about 30 min, which was not a problem. We went to the bar. The bar was huge, we had no problem finding 7 seats together. Hmmm. Seemed strange to me, but then I quickly found out why. The bartender was rude, not smiling, and seemed very agitated that we sat down. I was in shock. So were the rest of the people I went with. There were literally 3 other people at this bar. We were escorted to our table in just under 10 min. Perfect, because the bar area was morbid with the angry bartender.  \nOur server was on point, with excellent service. I decided I'd say something to our server about the bar experience after we were through  and he immediately knew what I was going to say, as if he had  complaints all the time on Mr rude bartender. So he brought the GM over. I told her about her one employee who people see as soon as they walk in, and she was happy I expressed to her. Sorry, not impressed, but food was ok. Not worth over 120.00 per person."

In my opinion the food is on the level of Olive Garden and below Pasta Pomodoro.  YIKES!  The primary reason we went here was the fairly decent reviews and because we were going to see a show at Caesar's.  After a couple of bad experiences eating at hotel restaurants in Vegas...I'll stick to those that are standalone restaurant businesses for now on (e.g., Maggiano's and Casa Di Amore)."

I made the reservation and asked to sit somewhere with a view. To my surprise they listened! From our seats we had a great view of the pool which gave us something to look at during dinner. \nAs for the food we started with the calamari. It was good but I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had. The breading was coming off and the portion was not family style. The wine list was safe and we did find something that was tasty without being too pricey. For my meal I had the risotto, I loved it. However, I could have done without the carrots. My girlfriend had the manicotti and she said it was good but not great. The service was fair. It was odd that there were so many workers running around but it took a good while before we got our first drink. But after the drinks came to the table, the service did improve. Bottom line, Rao's is a great place to take a group of people if you want a nice meal, good atmosphere, and you don't to mind paying $17.00 for calamari."

            "review": "Not bad, but not great for the money spent. \n\nI read a few reviews here on Yelp before and after I went to Rao's. I had to confirm what I had read to be accurate. Among the situations other Yelper's have listed, such as being told they are fully booked or that they they don't have a particular bottle wine (due to the lower price of the bottle..) I can tell you both of these things happened to myself and my party. \n\nWe originally tried to make a reservation for 8 pm on a Friday and were told there was absolutely no way that would be possible for 3 people. The reservationist directed us to come in and sit at the bar if we liked and we could wait for a table to open up for dining. This is what we decided to do. \n\nWe strolled in just before 8 pm to a crowded bar at Rao's. My female companion inquired at the door about a table for 3. We wanted to be thorough in case a cancellation or something of the sort had occurred. The young hostess assured us there was no way we would be seated in the dining room before 930 p.m. We decided to go to the bar for a drink. Sitting at the bar, the room was fairly full. As I turned to look at the dining room, I saw 7 empty tables. All clean, prepped and ready to go. At 830, then 845, still no one sitting in them. Close to 9 pm we are seated to a half empty dining room. ... ... \n\nSo we sit down and my one buddy has been here before including the one in New York. He did the ordering of food. I ordered wine. Figuring the 3 of us would drink at least 2 bottles of wine throughout dinner.. (we like wine:) I decided on a $80-ish bottle of Montepulciano. The server came by to tell us that the wine was unavailable and suggested a $95 dollar bottle instead. I told him I would check the menu a bit and get back to him. Im not afraid of a $95 bottle of wine, but the review I had read was ringing in my ears.. so I decided on a $70-ish bottle instead... ALSO unavailable. So when I decided to go to the $95 dollar bottle .. they had it practically ready to pour! Haha.. It was almost comical. \n\nThe sommelier came by and was pouring wine as the first course of beet salad was arriving. I was serving the salad to my friends and was told by the sommelier that I \"do that very well\"..I said thanks, I am in the service industry also. \n\n\"Oh we didn't know you were service industry too\"... she said.. Hmm. Why does that matter I thought?\n\nOverall.. I have to tell you i was so unimpressed with the whole situation, that I just smiled, ate and ordered more wine. I gotta say.. the food was really unimpressive. My main gripe about 'American Style' Italian food is the over abundance of sauce, and lack of flavor.. in a high-end place like Rao's.. I would have expected that to be a non-issue. Not so. Really bland Sausage and Broccoli Rabe, unflavored red sauce on a couple of meatballs, and really just non existent on anything over the top delicious. Aside from the bottle of Ripasso I had in place of dinner, as I stopped dining after a few bites. Just not good. \n\nThe bartenders at the bar were very nice, smiling and made a great martini. It was a saving bit to the evening as they even smiled and wished us good night as we left. It was around $300 for the 3 of us, and is probably near average per person price, but far less than average dining experience. Sorry. Better luck to you if you try this out. I won't be back for dinner."

You can taste the fresh and the sauce was light and flavorful at the same time. My escort had the Shell Pasta with Ricotta Sauce - large shell pasta in red sauce with a gloop of ricotta to bring it all together. Delicious! We split the ground veal/pork/beef meatballs, which were very good. He would describe them as very *very* good. \nDefinetly full at the end of the meal. Of course I liked it, but it's pasta - what's not to like? Maybe how the NY scene raves about this place... maybe the Vegas real estate... conspired to affect my expectations. It was good, yes. It did not blow me away. I wouldn't recommend it .. but I wouldn't NOT recommend it either, make sense? Definetly not horrific but not superb, either. It's just sort of ... there."

He asked if we were getting appetizers to split and we said yes and picked up the \"Antipasto Della CASA\" which had amazing cheeses and meats, the \"Fritto Misto\" which was the best Calamari i ever tasted, and he suggested the famous Meatballs (which again, the best i ever had).  After the appetizer order, he took our menus which seemed a bit off but we didn't think much of it since we were having a good time.  After we ate the appetizers he came back over and asked if everything was good and if we needed anything else.  He was SHOCKED when we said we had been waiting to order more drinks and dinner.  His attitude completely changed and then he was all over our table being the nicest guy ever.  \n\nThe food was really good, i got the \"Chicken Scarpariello\" which was amazing, but seemed a little small and mostly peppers in the bowl, i wish it had a bit more sausage.

Having been invited once about 10 years ago, I truly can state back then I wasn't quite sure if I was in a great restaurant with great food, or If all the hype skewed my judgment as coming away from that experience As Teddy KGB said in Rounder's, like a teenager coming in for a quickie, I feel so unsatisfied.  \n\n\nNow some 10 years later the Las Vegas venue obviously not the same chefs, ingredients etc, were on our horizon this past Super Bowl weekend as 4 of us headed to the Forum shops of Ceases to give this location a whirl. 3 of us to dine for dinner tonight and Saturday night Super Bowl weekend the place is crowded but not packed to the rafters. Greeted by a very nice Italian looking gentlemen who was as pleasant as can be. (More on this later).  Seated in the lower area courtyard facing the windows to the pool, its dark out so not much to see. Well as things go I sit down on what can only be described on a soaking wet back half of the chair and I'm drenched. Here I am in a $300.00 shirt and expensive slacks that are soaked. Not even an apology from the waiters, host, mgr, nothing. They changed the chair out and it was like ok sit down shut the F*** up and eat. OK.\n\n\nOrdered a bottle of wine that was marked up a little excessively but nothing I couldn't live with based on the venue. The place is well appointed abet my wet chair with white table cloths attentive servers. Bread was hot & crispy with a nice good olive oil / balsamic to mix and dip. Butter was also served.  3 Appetizers were ordered the famous Rao's meatballs (+1) so we each had one, an order of the Mozzarella in Carrozza Crispy Fried Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich served with marinara Sauce and an order of the baked stuffed little neck clams.  \n\n\n\nThe meatballs were good nothing special and my mothers are far superior but I'm biased. The sauce again was ok, nothing great and I asked for \"Ricotta Cheese\" and the 3 waiters this is not a racist or culturally biased statement being Hispanic had no idea what I was referring to, then stated no we don't have that for the meatballs. OK Must be dreaming thought I saw a scoop being presented with the stuffed shells at the table next to me but if you say so.  The Carrozza was again nothing special was no great improvement over fried mozzarella at any chain restaurant and the same sauce as the meatballs and not enough of it. The clams were a hunk of bread crumb that I could not find them. Hmm. Maybe it was bread crumb stuffed in the clam shells. \n\n\n\nOn to Dinner where 3 entries were ordered Conchiglie al Pomodoro e Ricotta Shell Pasta with Fresh Ricotta Cheese and Marinara Sauce (Son of a B***) I knew there was Ricotta in this place, A Pollo Scarpariello Chicken Saut\u00e9ed with Hot and Sweet Italian Sausage and Yellow and Red Bell Peppers in a White Wine Sauce & Vitello alla Parmigiana Pounded and Breaded Veal Chop Topped with Marinara Sauce, Parmesan and Melted Mozzarella.   \n\n\n\nThe Shell Pasta was excellent you can taste the San Maranzano Tomatoes bursting with every bite  unfortunately for $28.00 the size of the portion could have fed my 5 year old nephews. MAYBE.  The Veal Chop $48.00 was truly good, fresh veal, pounded but not too thin with a nice sweet mozzarella cheese with a tasty marinara sauce.  A good Sized portion that would not hesitate to order again.  The Pollo Scarpariello which should have been one of the highlights, unfortunately got low marks from me. Normally rich in flavor especially when chicken remains on the bone as this was prepared, it should have had a nice vinegar base or spicy taste, but the sauce was bland like natural juice or chicken broth. Sausage was tasteless if not forgetful, and the peppers were mush.  No deserts were tried but some Espressos were served. Coffee was bitter / burnt tasting and even a shot of sambucca couldn't help. \n\n\nAll and all a very unremarkable meal that as New York had done 10 years ago left me shall we say \"UNSATISFIED\"   With the abundant amount of restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas now days I certainly expected and to be honest demanded more of this place. It was a 2.5 stars but her at Yelp we don't have that 1/2 star ability. I've had better, I've had worse, but at these prices we shouldn't be in the 2 Star range. PASS for Me.\n\n\nOn a sad note the nice gentlemen (Older Italian Guy) who greeted us upon entering was celebrating a birthday on the way out with the \"Rao Family of staff and friend\" I was informed last night that he passed away last night from a friend of mine who lives in Las Vegas. Truly makes you remember to take nothing for granted in life as tomorrow  is promised to no one."

I ordered the Chicken Scarpariello, and had the meatballs as well. Raos probably made the best meatballs I ever had, even though they were a bit on the pricy side for only two meatballs. The meatballs were pretty big, and very rich in flavor as well as very moist. The Chicken Scarpariello was on the bone, so I'm not the biggest fan, but very juicy and moist as well. Also had a bit of my friends pasta, which was cooked perfectly al-dente. Certainly a good experience to try something a bit different than Chicken Parmesan all the time.\n\n\nPROS\n*Service - Our waiter was fantastic, and very knowledgeable about everything in Las Vegas and was even telling us about how he used to be a professional poker player. Very casual dining experience and good pacing for bringing out our food.\n\n*Atmosphere - Really cool place facing out to the pool. Our waiter told us that their was some sort of modeling event going on during that week, so you can get a great view if you come out during the day most likely. \n\nCONS\n*Food Options - I didn't want my chicken on the bone, but that was the only option we had. Couldn't get grilled chicken added to a pasta or onto a salad, so that was a bit disappointing.

Once they got squared away, service picked up considerably.\n\nThe antipasto is very good.    The fusilli and the taglioline were both awesome and portions were huge.    We ordered a side of meatballs based on the Yelp reviews and they did not disappoint.   The only downside was that after having the meatballs, I could not finish my taglioline.\n\nThe wine list is decent but a tad expensive so we ordered a couple glasses instead."

But then, even I couldn't screw up a salad.   My friend had the veal milanese which she reported was w/o taste and dry as a bone.  I had the world famous lemon chicken.  The chicken had been marinated so long that it was like eating mashed potatoes.

Don't get me wrong the atmosphere is great and the staff was personable and professional, the antipasto the side of meatballs were great. \n\nThe problem is, I have a favorite dish and its one that every place does a little different and that's OK but when I saw that they had chicken scarpiello on the menu I thought I was in for a dinner to remember.  Rao's does it with bone in chicken pieces which I suppose is more authentic if harder to eat and that wasn't the problem the problem is I have had better for half the money at a little pizza/pasta place in Westchester NY! The sauce was just so so and the sausage was not the best (nor the worst certainly) that I have ever had and the chicken pieces were a little less than meaty.  Oh well I will dream that some day Martin Scorsese will cast me and I can get into the original and see how it stacks up!\n\nIf I had ordered anything else for dinner I probably would have given this place at least a 4 but it was sort of like meeting your child hood hero and finding out he has a beer gut and too much nose hair, he still might be a great guy but you built him up to be something better."

So, when I found out they opened a location in Las Vegas, I was thrilled. Food was amazing (we had Uncle Vincent's lemon chicken, pasta and Cesar salad), but the service was horrible. Our wait staff was inattentive, didn't take the time to discuss menu items, actually threw salad plates on our table, never asked if we wanted pepper for the salads, more water refills, etc. They were quoting a 45 minute wait with empty tables (although front of the house staff friendly) and the staff looking a bit bored. Never saw a manager checking tables as they should ensure the dining guests are happy. We visited Bouchon the night before (price points are about the same and the difference in service was night and day). I believe if Mr. Rao was aware of the type of service we observed tonight he would be embarrassed."

But then after waiting over a half hour, we finally get seated, and then reality hit! Rao's is great if you have no sense of taste and love bland food. They are known for their meatballs so a few of us ordered those. Let me tell you, the meatballs in the frozen section at the supermarket were better. Very bland. The lasagna? Again, not the worst I have ever had but very far from the best. Again, the ladies at the local church make better pasta dishes than Rao's and their lasagna does not cost $30. But the worst of the meal was the peas, onions and prosciutto.  What were they thinking? The  prosciutto was so tasteless! How do you make it so bland? \n\nAnyhow if you are thinking of eating at Rao's, don't. If you want to spend big bucks on a meal in Vegas, go over to the Bellagio and try their buffet, the locals love it. Or try FireFly Tapas over on Paradise Rd. I'm a foodie that's been coming to Vegas for 10 years. Don't waste your money here, unless of course, you enjoy spending big money on food with no flavor at all."

Setting aside high prices and service that would benefit from a few more hands-on-deck, Rao's is a worthy dinner for those seeking rustic red sauce on the Strip."

I think it would have been an insurmountable challenge for her to even crack a smile. \nWe were seated at a table that was located in a spot that it really didn't belong.\nThe table was located in the room to the left, in the position where a door would be placed. \nDuring the course of the meal, a number of dining parties had to pass right by our table to get to theirs. It would have made more sense to have maybe a table for two or four here in it's place to allow more space to pass through but that's just some food for thought (no pun intended). The place is pretty loud for such a restaurant and the sound carries which is a byproduct of a room with low ceilings and a sitting near the room's entrance/exit.\n\nWe tried the famous Traditional Rao's Meatballs. \nI would say the meatballs were the highlight portion of the meal.\nAt about the size of an orange and served in two these balls of meat (pork, beef and veal) were bathed in the marinara sauce, tender and cooked immaculately. \n\nOn to the main course: the red rose went to the..... Linguine with clams and red sauce. I didn't detect the pepper flakes or white wine. Probably had I gone with the white sauce, certain elements to the dish might have stood out more. I did like how they toss the pasta at the table right before serving. I think it does prevent the sauce and ingredients from falling to the bottom of the plate.\nIt was a solid dish but wouldn't called it spectacular. The red sauce didn't exactly pop with the pasta. Quite frankly I think I could have prepared a dish that could have resulted in similar quality. \n\nThe service and waitstaff were spotty with the exception of the water guy. If we were a group of girls, the service would have been a notch or two better. Our waiter got \"thirsty\" once a party of women were seated a few tables down from us and was more attentive to them. \n\nAt least with the dessert I got hooked up with an extra scoop of gelato, courtesy of the favorable mistake on the part of the dessert chef. \n \nDoes the food here warrant a return trip from me? Unless it's the meatballs I'd say \"naw\".\n\nNow some of the attractive women dining here made for an interesting dinner. But that's another story for another day."

And the food was just as good as in NY. \nThey were filming for the food network while I was there, part of  \"10 Best places to eat before you die\". Watch it! \nSo what are you waiting for?

Upon arriving at 10 p.m. (Vegas time, on a Monday night) we were told they didn't have a table for two (despite our being able to see many open tables). That's ok, we're happy to sit at the bar. The bartender was super nice, very helpful with suggestions for food & wine. We tried a Tuscan red (1st time, despite being AVID wine drinkers & Italian food & restaurant fans) and it was great. My husband got the Chicken Scappiolini (or something like that, the menu isn't available on line) at the bartenders suggestion & he LOVED it! Tons of chicken (bone in) & sausage, smothered in red, yellow & green (sweet & hot) peppers, with onions & garlic. Smelled amazing! I had the Ravioli Pillows (beggars purses stuffed with Ricotta & pear, (wow) in a light parmesean, butter, sage, cranberry, oil sauce).... they were rich & decadent & delish!!! Absolutely delicious dinner. I DO recommend Rao's & believe the hype now. We will continue our pursuit of the NY location, but would definitely return to the Vegas one as well."

When we do Vegas, we always try and go big meaning we do the fancy expensive restaurants that we normally wouldn't ever do at home. I wanted to eat at Rao's for my birthday dinner since I love Italian food and am a mob buff. I read about the history of the original Rao's Restaurant in New York and the traditions they kept and used to authenticate the Las Vegas location. Also I read that at least one of the owners Frank Pellegrino and his son Frank Pellegrino Jr. were there every night. Do some research and you'll see you'll remember Frank Pellegrino from Goodfellas and the Sopranos.\n\nAs I mentioned in the above paragraph the Las Vegas Rao's took some of the traditions from their New York location and put them here. When you walk in you see the bar decorated with the Christmas decorations up regardless of what time of year it is. It's a really warm inviting vibe with the Christmas lights and holly especially since I love Christmas. Also the jukebox is blaring music but I have to say they have only good stuff (real music) on the jukebox such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Louis Prima and I was honored to be able to play some songs and that jukebox. They also have framed photos covering almost every area of the walls of family and celebrities who autographed them.\n\nThe food was awesome, real authentic Italian cuisine. I had the Mozzarella Planks for an appetizer, Chicken Parmesan for the main course and a glass of Chianti. The whole meal was delicious and the service was great. Picture an atmosphere where the music is loud, everyone there is enjoying themselves with great food and drink and you got Rao's.\n\nWe paid our bill and as we were leaving I noticed the owner Frank Pellegrino Jr. by the bar area. I went up to him and introduced myself and told him it was my first time dining at Rao's and that my party and I loved everything about the whole Rao's experience from the ambience and atmosphere to the food. He was very kind, courteous and receptive and thanked me for coming in and asked if he could buy me and my party a round of drinks at the bar. I was floored by this kind gesture and said I appreciated it but it wasn't necessary and he said he insisted. I called my brother and my friend and they met me back at the bar and I introduced them to Mr. Pellegrino Jr. and we got to chill at the bar with a nice drink after dinner.\n\nAmazing service like this is so rare and hard to find now a days so that's why I take the time to make sure the world knows about it when it happens. Frank Pellegrino Jr. and the Rao's staff are all class acts and they make you feel like part of their family. I will be back for sure next time and I am in Vegas and would give this place 10 stars if I had the option!"

Since it's pretty much impossible to get a reservation at the Rao's in Manhattan, as soon as I saw this one in Vegas, we had to stop in!  We went during lunch and there's no need for reservations, there's some tables \"outside\" aka overlooking the busy hallway giving it an almost sidewalk like feel or you can sit at the bar (which has some nice sunken corners for 3).  Wait staff is somewhat slow but food was really good.  Dont get me wrong, staff was really nice but ya...service was sllooowwwww.  We noticed a few people frustrated with not getting their food in time and having to leave or waiting more than 5 mns to pay their check.  Mind you it was NOT busy...Bar area was only half full.  Most were conference people so no idea if they made it out on time, we were in no rush so we enjoyed ourselves right up to their \"break\" time before dinner.\n\n*Affettati Misti: thinly sliced parma prosciuto, soppressata, cubed provolone cheese, gaeta olives, pickled cornichons, sweet marinated garlic and mache greens.  Delicious and sure to severely increase your salt intake...\n*Le Polpotte di Rao's: traditional Rao's meatballs served in tomato sauce.  2 HUGE succulent and flavorful meatballs in some of the best tomato sauce.  Hands down, some of the best sauce. Really.\n*Bianca (Foccacia): really great flatbread to go with both dishes.  One to cut the salt and one to mop up the sauce.  Bread was crisp outside and fluffy inside.  Great olive oil, rosemary and sea salt sprinkled on.\n\nWe'll definitely return next time we're in Vegas since it takes 3-4 months to get a table in nyc ..."

He paid great attention to our table, although we were probably too loud and disturbed the other tables in the restaurant since the manager told us to quiet it down! Our friends probably ordered the appetizers before we got there, so I'm not sure of the names of what we ate. We had a clam dish that reminded me of Oyster Rockefeller and a plate of fried calamari with a few fried shrimp. Fried calamari to me tastes the same everywhere, which isn't bad if you're in the mood. The clams tasted great. Too bad we all had to share, so I only got to eat one! \n\nFor my main dish, I ordered the lemon chicken, and it was super delish! It is chargrilled to perfection. It would have been nice if it also included veggies, but that's ok b/c I ate the yummy buttery green beans from my friend's salmon dish. Her salmon had almonds on it, but to me, salmon tastes the same as well anywhere you go. I believe I finished my plate, although I did share my chicken with a few friends. Being that it's an Italian restaurant, I should have ordered pasta, but I wasn't in the mood. I was happy with my choice anyway, so if you're in the mood for chicken, order that when you come here!"

Rao's as a strong reputation to live up to and considering it is just about impossible to reserve a table at their NYC location I was looking forward to dining here.\n\nI arrived for an early dinner with a colleague and we elected to dine on their patio (people watching is great at Caesars Palace) so we did not get to experience the NYC style restaurant inside. Right up front service was fantastic. Our server was very knowledgeable regarding the chef specials, their wine, and very patient and agreeable as we customized our entrees. \n\nFrom start to finish the food was exceptional. Start off with fresh bread and their homemade butter while you attempt to pair down your dinner choices. I opted for the Caesar salad with fresh cheese and extra anchovies. My dining companion's caprese salad is a great choice as well.\n\nI selected the linguine and clam sauce with white sauce. The clams were small Manila clams. The dish was spiced with, noticeable, garlic, white wine, & red pepper. After devouring my dinner I finished off the wonderful sauce with their bread. Absolutely exceptional!\n\nMy dining companion had the Bolognese with penne pasta she reported bliss as well. \nRao's is indeed pricey but well worth it if you care to experience a wonderful traditional Italian fare."

There was nothing that I wish would have been done differently.\n\nOne of the most noticeable things was that every single person we had an interaction with on staff was so friendly. It's clear there is a dedication to customer service there.\n\nWe went on a Friday evening, made a reservation on Open Table, and although it wasn't completely full (no one was using the tables outside of the entrance), the back was fairly full. We did not feel cramped on other diners, though.\n\nOur waiter was patient and attentive, suggesting but not pushing complimentary dishes to what we were ordering. He smiled when we said we HAD to try the meatballs! What blows my mind is how quickly the food came out. I truly don't care how it was prepared (I mean, of course I do), but it was LIGHTNING QUICK. We honestly thought it was for the table next to us. The runner who brought our food out made light of his job and made us chuckle by asking us, \"Would you like some cheese on your cheese?\" (Parmesan)\n\nMy husband had a full belly and loved all our choices: Beef Lasagna, Eggplant Parm, Ricotta Shells, MEATBALLS, Cabernet. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY THE MEATBALLS YOU PROBABLY HATE PUPPIES, TOO, DON'T YOU?! Wonderfully delightful.

And the service and ambiance are exactly perfect.  The food has always been quality, and I've never had something here I didn't like.  It's a perfect place for a nice dinner with one friend or a big corporate meal...either way, it works just right.  \n\nThis last trip, I went there once with all my work peeps (9 of us total).  We all loved everything we got for appetizers and entrees and desserts.  The portions are ginormous.  The prices are high, but you really get a lot for what you pay for.  Just know: you will only finish about half of what you get. \n\nThe wine list is insane, with many bottles well over $500, $1000, and up.  This place definitely isn't a cheap place, but you gotta splurge sometimes, right???\n\nI also went there a few times before dinners elsewhere for a dirty martini (I was staying at Caesar's).  The bartenders are all very old-school...and it really feels like you're in a mafia bar.  I do love it.  The dirty martinis are giant and come with blue-cheese stuffed olives, so they make me happy.\n\nI also went my last night in town with a friend to sit at the bar and have an appetizer and a cocktail before heading out for the night.  Whether you're ordering a $300 dinner or a $30 snack, the staff still treats you the same way.  They're very polite and professional, but super friendly.  We both got martinis and ordered the Fritto Misto Deep Fried Calamari, Shrimp, Cod Fish and Julienne Zucchini with Remoulade and Marinara Sauce ($21).  Even though I've been there about 10 times and know that the portions are HUGE, I was shocked by how big this appetizer was.  It was the prettiest Fritto Misto I've ever seen (and I've seen many), as well as one of the best tasting ones I've ever eaten.  The zucchini was a nice little touch, too.  The shrimp were fantastic, the cod was flakey and good, but the calamari was the best part.  So, So, So good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We had just stopped in for a snack, but left feeling full!  And now it's a week later, and I'm still thinking about how delicious this was!\n\nSome other favorites from the menu are the softball sized meatballs (sooo good!...but honestly, you can get one order to feed an entire table), the caprese salad (big wedges of tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella instead of thin slices of each), the pastas are all good (especially the shrimp fra diavola), but the real stars are the meat and veal entrees.  The parmesans and milaneses are so big they don't even really fit onto the plate, but gosh darn they taste delicious!\n\nCan't wait for my next Vegas trip...where you'll definitely find me here at the bar and noshing on something delicious."

She helped us choose a fantastic Chianti and she suggested we try the meatballs...I am SO GLAD she \"made\" us get them!  \n\nEveryone at our table ordered something different and we each loved our entrees.  We had two appetizers - bruschetta and caprese salad.  The bruschetta was unbelievable and the caprese salad was perfection.  \n\nThe stars at this restaurant are truly the sauces and the meatballs.  The sauce I had on my angel hair pasta was marinara and was just out of this world.  The meatballs were fantastic and melt-in-your-mouth heaven!  \n\nWe cannot wait to go back to Rao's the next time we are in Vegas!"

We split an order of basically spaghetti and meatballs, and the meatballs are outstanding.  We were too stuffed to have desert and the desert options did not thrill me anyway (canolli, tiramisu, etc. - not anything you could not get at a pizza place - not speaking to the quality, but it was just a little predictable).\nThe bill was a little high and I do not think I would go back again without hitting a big jackpot.  However, I definitely do not regret going either."

This room is bright as it has many windows . The other dining rooms are interior and do not have windows and a dark atmosphere. We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation time. The hostess checked us in, asked to be seated in the vestibule and stated that we would be seated at our reservation time. The dining room was not very busy and we were seated at a nice table adjacent to a window overlooking the pool and gardens. \nOur server Matt was friendly and attentive. He was very familiar with the menu and provided  us with a description of the specials and some recommendations. Follow up though out was timely. \nA starter was an order of baked  Little Neck Clams. Six clams topped with bread crumbs and oregano and served with a wedge of lemon. Overall they were very tasty but one was chewy. \nThe meatballs are listed as a side but the order of two is more than enough as an entree. The Meatballs are made with Ground Veal, Pork and Beef, Italian Breadcrumbs and Seasonings in a wonderful Marinara Sauce. The order of buttery mashed potatoes was also enough for two people.\nThe OssoBuco, Braised Veal Shank  Veal Jus, Gremolatta, served over Saffron Risotto  is one of the best in town. The OssoBuco is a complete meal in itself, no other sides required.\n\nDesert must wait for a return visit."

The vodka pasta the other couple mostly split was well-seasoned and wonderful, but not really worth the price tag. The steak with warmed tomatoes, one of the veal dishes, and a broccolini/sweet sausage pasta dish rounded out the meal...all very good dishes, but nothing outstanding or really that memorable. I love Italian food and pasta, but Rao's was a tad overpriced. The portions were large, but the 4 of us opted to share everything \"family-style,\" to taste more dishes...which I also HIGHLY reccomend. I think if we had all picked one dish, we either would have been bored, disappointed, or spent too much and had too much left over to order courses. \n\nThe waiter was extremely knowledgable about the food, restaurant, chef, wine, etc....but he was sort of obnoxious and in our faces and too much....It was also a little strange to me how much information he went on about...at a nicer place like that, to just assume all of the diners were idiots with an utter lack of food knowledge was a little strange. The waiter often explained dishes and items to us, like describing the different levels of doneness for steak, explaining that broccolini is bitter, etc...I think maybe a different table of people might have loved his comments better, but oh well. All in all this place was just ok, not somewhere I'd bring friends in town to, but I would absolutely eat here meeting people."

It was the last night of our trip and we wanted to really celebrate.  The menu called to me, and I was psyched.\n\nWe sat \"outside\" in the tables meant to mimic NYC; a nice enough spot, and even the noise from the casino wasn't too distracting.  We were welcomed with bread and olive oil, all very delicious, and we ordered a bottle of Montepulciano. I started with the Roasted Beet Salad which, truth be told, was one of the reasons I really wanted to come.  It was tasty, but was loaded with way too much arugula and not enough of everything else.  There's not much worse than an uneven salad.\n\nI knew the salad would fill me, so for my entr\u00e9e I ordered the Baked Clams.  Again, I so wanted them to be good and they just were not.  Way too much filling, which had little flavor.  My fianc\u00e9's Spaghetti Alla Bolognese was truly delicious, however.  The sauce was rich and had layers of meaty flavor.  We both enjoyed that!\n\nAgain, we skipped dessert because there wasn't much on the menu that was a 'must-order'.  The service was pleasantly acceptable, nothing of note, until it was time for the check.  Our server brought us the check and it was not ours, not realizing until she ran the credit card.  The charge stayed on our card for a few days, which was a definite inconvenience.\n\nUnfortunately, (and it pains me to say this!) several times during the meal, I found myself wishing that we'd gone across the way to the Bacchanal Buffet."

This place is Italian through and through, and of course I'm talking about the food.  It's located inside Caesar's Palace, near the buffet and the pool.  Truthfully, you could probably eat here cheaper for dinner than you can at the buffet.  I remember asking about the dinner price at the buffet, and it was $51 per person.\n\nThey start you off with a large bread basket here, which has a wide assortment of breads.  We even had some olive oil to dip our bread in.  It was very good.  I split a caesar salad with my wife, and it's a good thing because it was way too much for one person.  For my main course, I ordered the lasagna.  Once again, a huge portion.  I could barely even finish half of it.  It was good, but certainly not the best lasagna I've ever had.  Either way, I was plenty full.  My wife had a penne vodka type dish.  I tried a few bites and it was excellent.  I think I'll consider getting her dish the next time.  There are several other things I'd like to try on the menu (meatballs), but they'll just have to wait.  Just like most of the restaurants at Caesar's Palace, this place is pretty pricey.  Two people could eat here for less than $100, if you don't order alcohol.  It's worth it in my book, though.  I had absolutely no room for dessert, so I can't comment on that.  I look forward to coming back here again in the future."

My friend decided to go to Rao's since they had several options in their prix fixe menu compared to the other restaurants participating in this event.\n\nSo we made a reservation and was seated right away.  The restaurant was probably 3/4 full when we got in at 7:15pm.  The waiter did get our drinks and orders immediately.  I got a pear martini and it was good.  My friends got a Malibu and Pomegranate martini and they all enjoyed it.  All four of us ordered the prix fixe menu. We had baked clams topped with bread crumbs for the appetizer and it was good but just a tad salty.  The main entree took a little longer to arrive after the appetizer.  This was when the service started to suck. So we got our entrees and I got the ravioli with Bartlett pears and ricotta cheese topped with dried cranberries and basil.  It was pretty good.  You can taste the sweetness of the pear, tartness of the cranberries and saltiness of the Parmesan cheese.  I liked the favors all together.  My other friends got the pork chop with roasted vegetables and they both said that it was dry.  I believe one of them even mentioned that they wanted medium and both still came out dry.  So probably 15 minutes after we finished our entrees, that's when the waiter decided to show up and asked us if we wanted desserts.  I got the strawberry shortcake and it was disappointing. It was very ordinary and it tasted like it was not from a upper scale restaurant.  Some of my friends had tiramisu and I tasted it, it was just mediocre. I'm a dessert person and I always look forward to happy ending desserts.\n\nAfter desserts, we probably waited 20 minutes to get our bill!

I rather have normal cheap pizza at my cheap ass hotel, than to spend 20 dollars on a pizza that was not OUT OF THIS WORLD.... \n\nTHE PASTA VODKA something blah blah was good, but not good enough that is deserves four stars from me. Excuse me, the ambiance is nice but I actually want to spend money elsewhere! Let alone, drop 30 on some pasta thats not out of this world! I definitely DO NOT recommend this place to anyone! Save your money and time, and go to a buffet instead!"

Well, we had dinner this past Saturday night (11/19/2011) and I am sad to say we'll not be coming back anytime soon.\n\nTo start with, while we were seated in one of our favorite booths, there was a large group of diners (dressed in shabby jeans, t-shirts and jerseys) seated close by that were beyond loud, even by Vegas standards. I mean loud, disruptive, vulgar and screaming to a point that everyone in the place was disgusted. While this can happen anywhere, the management of the place did nothing, even the wait staff complained to us about them. They finally left and were replace by an equally loud and obnoxious group. \n\nThe atmosphere was so bad, my wife and I decided to speed up our meal. The meal arrived and it was not up to the Rao's level of the past... I dare say verging on awful. We skipped desert finished our bottle of wine and got the bill only to find drinks added to it that was not ours at all. While the bill was adjusted, it seemed to be a topper to an awful dining experience at what was one of our favorite places to com e each time we visited Las Vegas."

Feel free to click that little \"Useful\" button down below.\n\nAtmospherically speaking, Rao's is very nice. Warm, clean, inviting. Sort of homey, if you lived in a really nice home. With lots of people eating in it.\n\nFoodwise, Rao's is merely good, in my opinion. The pasta I had was fine, but there wasn't anything to really set it off from a bunch of other Italian restaurants I've been to. And it's pricey too. The average pasta price was around $24. A moderately sized side of spinach was $14. Yes, I realize price around here is as much a factor of location as anything else, but even factoring that in I don't think the price is QUITE justified. \n\nThe service was good. Our waitress had good recommendations and water & ice tea glasses were refilled properly.\n\nSomething else useful to know (hint, hint) is that while it doesn't say so on the menu, you can get half portions of pasta for a little more ($2 I think) than half the price of the full portion. I made a meal out of two half pastas, and it was enough food. They also give you plenty of bread. My friend's chicken dish was also quite big. If you aren't super hungry you could probably split an appetizer and an entree between two people, which would make Rao's a bit more affordable.\n\nI'm a little torn between 3 & 4 stars, but at the end of the day I'm not ready to call myself a fan."

First of all, the Manhattan location doesn't accept reservations (calling their number is hilarious - basically a thank you for calling but go away message).  Secondly, I don't know any mobsters.  My chances of actually getting Regis Philbin to invite me is slim (though oddly enough, I think this is my only likely hope).  Lastly, I can't pony up enough $$ to actually buy myself a table there (one of 11 I think), that would be if one actually became free, which would never happen.  Then there are the logistics of eating at Rao's - since they are in the Hood, and you have to hire a car service to wait for you while you eat, or have someone drive your car and wait or something...   \n\nIn short, Las Vegas will have to be a flimsy, Disney-fied, substitute to experiencing the real thing.  The first question I had was, how could they open such a large restaurant, with so many tables and translate the experience from New York to Vegas?  The answer - Since no one has actually eaten at the original, it doesn't matter.\n\nThe decor is upscale pizza joint like, red and white checkered tableclothes and lots of photos of celebrities who apparently have made it in to Rao's.  I ordered the stuffed zucchini blossoms that were stuffed with cheese and anchovies and deep fried.  It was salty and gooey goodness.  At any Italian restaurant, I like to order either a bolognese or a red sauce type pasta, as I think it's a barometer to how good it is.  So, I had the rigatoni with red sauce and pancetta.  I have to say, it was very good, but not out of this world exceptional.  The meatballs didn't disappoint - moist and tasty.  \n\nThe service was very attentive - I think they imported some characters from New York to add charm.  It worked.  Overall, the atmosphere was an upscale but down home Italian American restaurant.  Here it seems like the recipes were handed down through generations, and there is lots of care taken to make solid dishes.  You won't find the food complicated by new fangled things like truffle oil and flavored foams.  I think it's exactly this which keeps Rao's in New York exclusive and packed every night with loyal diners, and they were successful in recreating (some of) the moment in Las Vegas."

Whatever, with food this good, we literally put the bag over our air conditioner vent and ate it cold the next morning for breakfast and it was still dope.\n\nWhile we waited for our table, we had strong but delicious Manhattans at the bar.

For example, a Caesar Salad is $15.  Is it better than the Caesar at Italian Village in Chicago?  Not even close IMHO.  The croutons were good though.\n\nI had the Spaghetti Bolognese upgraded to linguini with no problems.  It was a nice dish of pasta, not too large, but $28?  Not worth it at all; if it came in at around $12 at most, it would be acceptable.  So spending over $40 for a plate of pasta and a salad (no drinks) is unthinkable unless there is something magical about the food.  The only magic was the disappearance of my money.\n\nFor appetizers, we had a family platter of calamari with a few shrimp and a fillet of a white fish.  Great texture to the calamari, but I'm sure other restaurants can make the same quality for much less.  The meatballs in marinara sauce were really good, tender, flavourful and a nice size.\n\nIf this restaurant has some notoriety, it is not for the food.

It's like an unofficial tradition for us; one that is important and when visiting new cities, it's a welcome challenge to find the right spot.  That said, we're not made of money, so dining on the Strip was challenge enough.  Additionally, we won no large sums of money betting our luck (in fact, I lost and only lost), so it had to be date night on somewhat of a budget (yeah!).\n\nI saw a short \"ad\" for Rao's on one of the hotel's internal channels (the Vegas Dining channel).  Not really sure what other options we had (we were decided on Italian), we decided to give it a try.  Reviews were pretty good and it was nearby our hotel.  Not thinking, we made no advance reservations so we were greeted with a 45-minute wait at 6-ish on a Thursday.  No problem, we'll just stop by the Payard place next door and wait for the phantom chocolates to drop (review to follow).\n\nAfter shuffling through some of the hotel and avoiding the gambling floor for those 45 minutes, we returned and were seated at a cozy-ish two-top in the back.  My chair was pulled out for me--how proper.  The bread basket they presented was pretty awesome (or maybe I was just hungry?).  The cheese crisp thing (that's a technical term) was my fave.  For wine we went cheap-o route and did the half bottle (for $35); yes, I felt bad the sommelier had to come by just for that (and I'm sure his thoughts were similar) but it is what it is.  After presenting Dude with a taster (of a $35 half bottle haha), my wine was poured first--how proper.\n\nWe split a salad for our first course (on suggestion of the server; good call because it was huge).  Lettuce was fresh and crisp and croutons were a delight.  For our mains I got stuffed ricotta shells and he got linguini with clams in white sauce.  By the time it arrived the bread had done its work in my stomach and I was basically stuffed (much like the shells I ordered).  Dude commended his dish, and mine was darn tasty as well.  We skipped dessert, as we had plans for Serendipity 3 afterwards.\n\nMaybe it's because we're basically from a cow town; we're not high society folk.  Maybe it's because we enjoy food (but not necessarily spending a paycheck on it).  Or maybe it's because really, this place was just fine... but Rao's was just fine.  I see a lot of mixed reviews on this listing but I stand by my own.  Was it overpriced?  Probably, but so is everything on the Strip.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the food was good.  Do I wish they offered a (full) bottle of wine for less than $70, sure, but I also wish I'd won big enough at Black Jack that it wouldn't have mattered!  So overall, a successful choice.  I don't know if I'll make it a point to go back should I ever be in the area again, but I'll at least know it's there in Caesar's Palace if I so desire.\n\nAnd at the end of the meal our server handed the check to Dude--how proper.\n\nLadies be treated like ladies here.  Haha.  /sexism (mainly joking I don't really care)"

The chicken was simple but so delicious. The dark meat chicken was seared then quickly sauteed with pickled pappadew peppers, onions, and bell peppers. The sharp vinegary bite of the peppers was so vibrant and added such a brightness.  Matched with the sweet peppers and onions, I was in love with the chicken.  The plainest pasta available was probably a tad oiler than I would have preferred, but it was meant as a pasta course not a base for my chicken.

We shared the seafood salad (it's large enough to split), a meatball (appetizer), and for my dinner I had  Pan-Seared Pork Chop, Topped with Sauteed Hot and Sweet Cherry Peppers. The pork chop was hands down one of the best I've ever had. VERY flavorful, it was like the food was dancing in your mouth. DEFINITELY recommend it!"

            "review": "Rao's in New York City is notorious.  It is not clear how good their food actually is since no one is able to get a reservation at the restaurant.  Seriously, the wait is measured in terms of years, and at the end of the day, they primarily serve pasta like most any other Italian restaurant in the city.  In Las Vegas, it is a different story.  One can freely walk into the restaurant with the hope of actually getting a table.  Short of that, a seat at the bar is almost always guaranteed.  I believe the menu is the same, and the owner was at the restaurant on my visit, so I felt like I was able to have roughly the same experience as I would in New York if I had somehow managed a reservation.\n\nI ordered the gnocchi bolognese and had a glass of Montepulciano.  The dinner began with a bread course served with a plate of olive oil and vinegar.  I was happy with this beginning with the tasty bread and the good quality olive oil.  The gnocchi were beautifully presented simply dressed in a deep dish.  I had an impressive amount of pasta before me, and the gnocchi were not heavy at all.  I thought the texture was great.  The sauce was very flavorful and balanced.  Simple and good, exactly what I wanted.  The wine paired well.  More generally, I was pleased to have a nice selection of Italian wines available by the glass.  \n\nThe restaurant itself was fairly busy and very dynamic.  The interior is dark and nearly every square inch of the walls was decorated with photos of the celebrities who have visited.  I know that can be kind of cheesy, for example at the Carnegie Deli, but here I was getting more of a Minetta Tavern kind of feel.  I think this location of Rao's is a wonderful place to have a glass of wine and a plate of pasta.  It definitely gets my vote over places like B and B Ristorante which charges far more for less.  Recommend."

            "review": "I know I have said that when I travel I prefer to go to places that I can't when I'm home. Rao's NYC might be the toughest reservation on the planet; Rao's Las Vegas is much easier. It's the same family who owns it and not a private equity or franchise like some other big name 'chains', from what I understand. When we checked in with the hostess, she did give me advice on how to get into NYC and I will let you know if it works.  Rao's is an old school, family style Italian restaurant. Keep that in mind when ordering or you'll end up with left overs for days, or so full you may explode. Many of the pastas and salads can be halved (which isn't noted on the menu).\n \nWe started with a roasted beet salad. It was your typical beet salad with arugula. Gramercy Guy and I disagree though; I think the beets were from a can and not roasted in house. \n\nOne of my favorite dishes ever is chicken scarpiello or sometimes called country chicken. It's chicken on the bone with sweet and spicy sausage and onions and peppers. I get it often when I see on a menu. The Rao's version is exceptional.  I don't even need to look at the menu, I know I will always get this.\n\nWe did try a new pasta this time, the ravioli purses which had pear and ricotta in a butter and sage sauce with dried cranberries. They were really, really good. Happy we only got a  1/2 order because otherwise, I wouldn't have eaten my chicken. They had a nice sweetness that I think in a strange way would work well as a dessert. How great would pasta for dessert be?\n\nFor dessert we got the profiteroles. They looked amazing and were huge, but I wasn't impressed. Maybe it was my fault for getting a French dessert in an Italian restaurant, the puff pastry was chewy and there was way too much chocolate sauce which was cold. I like it when they drizzle warm, semi-sweet chocolate right on top so the chocolate and ice cream melt together. This dessert misstep will not stop me from going back to Rao's in the future.\n\nFor pictures and more reviews http://gramercygirl.blogspot.com/2012/03/raos-las-vegas.html"

We are so fond of their arribiatta sauce that when we learned there was a restaurant here we were thrilled.  Unfortunately, bc it was NYE we were at mercy of a prie fixe.   The caprice salad was the highlight of the meal.  For the pasta course I had these browned butter ravioli which were ok and David had penne with vodka sauce, same.  Dinner he had some chicken dish and I had the eggplant parm.  I love eggplant parm, but it was pretty obvious the hard little disks were not cooked to order and probably reheated from prep last night?  I had cheesecake for the prix fixe - a 2\" square of it you might expect at an office party.  All in all, we let our expectations be too high based on the jar sauce. The cool thing is that we got to taste their olive oil - available online.  So we will continue ordering the good stuff but likely won't feel the need to return to the restaurant\n\nIncidentally, excellent service.  But id rank this one on the same level as a bucca de beppo."

            "review": "I'm surprised at the negativity of some of the reviews below.  The common theme in the reviews is that this restaurant is crazy expensive.  Hello -- welcome to Vegas!  Even the frickin' Starbucks have marked up their prices in Vegas.  Doesn't that tell anyone beside me anything?\n\nOkay, and so once you 'get' that things are pricier in Vegas, how does Rao's do?  Firstly, I don't know the NYC location.  Never heard of this 'chain' until I stumbed upon this Vegas location.  What made our experience special --\n\n-- is that we were initially sat in the inner room, with the dark booths -- a vintage flavored Eyetalian restaurant.  If I had been sat more outside in the cafe area, I'm convinced I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.\n\nNext I had the only waiter I've ever asked the name of and requested on returns trips.  Yup -- I won't eat at this place unless I'm inside and being served by this dude.  Really nice guy.  Won't give his name or I may jam up my little secret hideaway.\n\nNext up is the bread they drop on the table.  Hello.  My God niece's jaw dropped like a rock when that hit the table.  She's a carb addict and was in instant heaven.  I was in heaven watching her in heaven.\n\nSo then we order.  It doesn't matter exactly what we ordered because everything is essentially the same quality here:  somewhere between B+ to an A-.  To get an A or A+, they'd have to serve uniquely distinctive dishes with bigger portions.  But they don't because they're taking the french bistro 'less is more' thing instead of the old school 'giant portions of mediocrity'.   So the clam pasta was good, but not amazing.  The manicotti solid but not stunning.  The gnocchi definitely tasty but not ambrosia.\n\nUnderstand, I tried the Onda Italian restaurant inside the Mirage.  Similar prices.  Food is between B- to B+.  But the windowless big room prohibitively claustrophobic -- as in, why sit here unless in a hurry? Service okay but not as enthusiastic as Caesar's.  CPK inside the Mirage probably offers the best value of all three places, but you're sitting IN the casino with all the thick cheesy cigarette smoke.  \n\nSo what is so terrible about Rao's again?   Not much.  They claimed the gnocchi were made fresh, but I'm not buying that.  The clams were tiny in the pasta, but voluminous, and the sauce with subtle and spicy.  If I were the manager of this place, I'd make the menu much smaller but everything simply amazing.  I'd use the Tao restaurant as a guide.  \n\nBut I've been told the Tao owners opened an Italian joint in Palazzo, called Lavo.  Guess what?  No, go ahead, guess.  That's right -- Yelpers say it's only so-so and way over-priced.  Get it?  Got it?  Good.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nUPDATE:  Had the Shrimp Scampi here.  A simply sinful ball of pasta with four BIG shrimp on top.  Not only my new favorite here, but with the Sea Bass at the TAO probably one of the favorite dishes in Vegas (so far)."

I have heard about Rao's for years because of its New York City location and reputation, so I was eager to dine there on this last trip to Vegas. Loved it and will make sure to eat there every time I go to Las Vegas.\n\nAtmosphere:\nExcellent...very warm, quite setting. This was a huge relief after a full day of crowds, loud music and noise the Las Vegas strip offers. We got there about 30 minutes before our reservation to have a drink at the bar. My husband loves old school cocktails and had an Old Fashioned. He raved about it. The walls were adorned with photos and memorabilia of Rao's legendary past and prestigious clientele. It was fun to take a few moments to look at their history. TIP: The bar is a great place to dine there if you can't get a table.\n\nWait Staff:\nProfessional, courteous and prompt. The hostess greeted us with a nice smile and offered to sit us at our table even though the rest of our party had not yet arrived. The waiter knew the menu well and made some good recommendations. The sommelier was knowledgeable and helpful. Some of the wines were incredibly expensive and others were very reasonably priced. We purchased a very nice Chianti (one we have purchased at Costco for $40 a bottle) and it was $99 at Rao's, which is a lower than average mark up. In a nutshell, the service could not have been better. TIP: Ask questions...the waiters know the menu well and can help guide you.\n\nFood:\nThere were 4 of us and we did our best to try the menu. The bread basket was excellent....some kind of white bread with olives and a Parmesan covered cracker of some kind. It came with a red pepper butter, which was very good but we preferred regular butter which they gladly brought us. We had the meatballs as an appetizer. They were excellent....very mildly seasoned and covered in the kind of marinara sauce I grew up eating. Our friends had the Steak Pizzaiola...the steak was perfectly cooked and the peppers were not too spicy. We had the Chicken Scarpariello...something I have never heard of before. It was chicken and sausage in a wine sauce....very rich and savory but also very tasty. We love pasta and asked for a side dish of rigatoni with the Bolognese sauce. Our other friend had the fusilli special with seafood and some kind of red pepper/cream sauce. Also very rich and savory but very good. We were too full for dessert. TIP: The portions are very large. If you are a party of 4, order three entrees and ask them to serve it family style, which they will gladly do for you. That way everyone gets to try a new dish.\n\nPricing:\nExpensive...the dinner, with the tip, was close to $400 ($100 per person). That is because we had a $100 bottle of wine. But don't expect to get out of there for less than $75 per person. TIP: Plan on spending a lot of money. There is NO cheap dining on the Las Vegas strip.  For a low priced meal, you will have to go downtown.\n\nSummary:\nWe enjoyed our experience there so much we cancelled our reservation for the next night and wet back to Rao's and ate at the bar. This time we had the salad (house salad...excellent and very tangy) and more meatballs. We also had coffee and dessert (the Cheesecake...very good) and coffee.\n\nWe loved it and will be return customers every time we travel to Vegas. It felt like I was dining at home.\n\nTIP: Make a reservation and ask for a table back by the glass wall facing the pool. Get there early and experience the bar too.\n\nThe only downside, as noted earlier, is the pricing. It is expensive dining but ALL  dining is expensive on the Las Vegas strip. It was worth it to us to find a place that was actually quiet (a rare thing in Las Vegas) and felt warm and welcoming.\n\nBuon Appetito!!"

            "review": "Ah Rao's. Living in the NYC area we have wondered what the food would be like as the Rao's in the city is hard, if not impossible, to get into. The destination is actually popular as a charity item with a reservation usually going for somewhere on the order of $10,000. Yes, that's a reservation and not the meal which we hear is of low to average cost for something in NYC.\n\nThus we had to head to Rao's in Las Vegas to see what the food is all about assuming...and hoping...it would be close to the elusive fare closer to our home. One of the dishes in particular that we wanted to try were the meatballs since our high mark on those has become Macaluso's in Miami Beach, FL.\n\nSo, how did everything turn out? First, it was fun going to the location. Caesars itself has always been a cut above. I remember from 30 years ago when the buffets were $2.99 at all of the other places and you would go to Caesars and spend the big $7.99 to get something really amazing. Well, at least for my first impression that scale of class still continues as you approach Rao's and see what looks like the facade of the NYC location rebuilt in the middle of the casino on the inside.\n\nOur reservations took us to the back... It started out as a quiet meal but the only downside to the entire experience was an extremely loud table of around 10 guys shouting at each other (describing their volume and not demeanor) for the entire dinner. Oh well... I had a caesar salad -- wow, it was huge! (and good) and a salmon dish for the main entree. The main dish was excellent but what about those meatballs?\n\nWell, I think Macaluso's has a runner in the top competition and the only way to figure out which is best is to do a side by side blind taste test on this one. Instead of trying to actually arrange that somehow I will leave the result for someone else to figure out and simple enjoy the best meatball experience at both places depending on where we are in the country."

Both were delicious. Then had the rigatoni filetto and the veal picatta. The pasta was incredible. Tasted the oinion and pancetta but it was't overpowering - it was perfectly balanced. The pasta was cooked just right. The veal was tender and the sauce was great. In addition to great food, the service was amazing. I wasn't feeling great that night and didn't dig into the pasta with my usual gusto. I didn't realize it, but the owner (manager?) must have been watching and came to our table to ask if everything was okay, and offered to prepare something different for us. I had to let him know, it wasn't the food - it was me. Great service, great food - can't wait to go back during our next trip to Vegas."

As an appetizer I got Cesar salad which was good just the dressing was a little lighter than I prefer. We also got an order of meatballs which were great. The meatballs were ever so soft and the red sauce complimented them. As for dinner I had a tough choice. I went with the veil parmesan. Boy was I glad I did. It was perfect. The veil was very tenor and the breading was just the right amount of crisp. Just the right amount of cheese melted. For dessert we finished off with the tirimasu, it was awesome. The tirimasu had just the right amount of softness with a cool espresso taste. I would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back when I visit vegas gain or if I can ever get into the New York one."

I had asked to be moved to a separate room...and was re-seated without hesitation. The meat balls were delicious....my fork went threw it like butter...ask for oregano for the meat balls....you can't go wrong with a little hint of fresh oregano. The lemon chicken is a bit expensive but well worth it. It's organic and the bones aren't black (which would hint of being frozen). Split everything with someone else and you'll have a nice filling meal for around $70. Thank you guys I'll be back."

Started out with the Cannellini & Scarolla soup, which was pretty good.  For a dinner entree, I had a simple dish of spaghetti in tomato sauce accompanied with a meatball, which is ordered separately.  Granted, this wasn't exactly the ideal dish to allow the restaurant to flex it's culinary might, but I came away definitely less impressed with the overall experience from my first visit--primarily due to a difference in quality of service.\n\nI think Rao's could best be summarized as a disappointment of expectations.  The food is solid, for the most part, but as a major restaurant in Caesar's Palace, I expected more of a \"wow factor\" that never materialized."

We got a cannoli and tiramisu those were great hence 2 stars but 14 bucks each??!!come on thats insane.After this meal i was still hungry luckily they give u bread!!I would not recommend and not return this place is overpriced and quality and portions are horrible.Go to buca or brio.The Worst Italian restaurant I have ever been too!!

We went for the famous meatballs so were a little surprised that they are only available as a side dish since my DH had his heart set on spaghetti and meatballs. Of course we had to order them as a side dish. we went with friends who use the Rao's meatball recipe at home and of course wanted to see if theirs measure up. Be warned that the meatballs can be a meal in themselves. You only get 2, but they are enormous! as a result we ordered too much food. Between us the DH and I got the spaghetti bolognese, the meatballs, and lamb chops. We would have been happy after the spaghetti and the meatballs. The lamb chops were absolutely delicious, but put me way past the point of being stuffed. \n The bolognese was delicious, as were the meatballs. for wine we got a chianti classico which was just ok. It would be nice to see more affordable options on their wine list. Our service was very good and the prices weren't outrageous, especially for Vegas. After trying the meatballs I had to come home and look up the recipe, and it has now replaced our old standby meatball recipe. There are a lot of great restaurants in Vegas, but I wouldn't hesitate returning to Rao's."

My fiance raved about the steak they brought out and told me it was one of the best steaks he had.  I had a cheese pasta,  it was delicious.  They also give you complimentary bread and I think it was fried cheese.  The only thing I was disappointed about was not having enough time to actually enjoy my food since we were in a rush.

I've been lucky to have wonderful homemade pasta at restaurants near my home in the San Francisco Bay Area my entire life; and I'm fairly well versed on the cost of doing business in an upmarket arena, and I was shocked at both the quality of the pasta dishes my family ordered, and the price on them. \nOur family ordered: Taglialini w/peas and ham, Ravioli, plain Taglialini w/butter (split between my 7yr old and 4yr old), and the special of the day (Parpadelle w/shrimp). The Taglialini w/butter was a whopping $26 for 3/4c. of boiled noodles tossed with butter, the Taglialini w/peas and ham $30 for an appetizer serving (1/2c. noodles with an equal amount of frozen peas and common ham), same price for my husband's ravioli (roughly 6-7 ravioli in red sauce), and the kicker was $39 for a bowl of under-seasoned Parpadelle w/5 medium shrimp (my 10yr old daughter's main course). \nWhat should have been pasta with beautiful texture, signs of being hand-cut, and stuffed pasta that resembled something more than a frozen product, was just at best \"Olive Garden\" American food being passed off as authentic Italian.\nWith such a let down on our last night in Las Vegas, I was incredibly grateful that we had an incredible service and meal experience at Gordon Ramsay's Steak the evening before."

Normally when you show up with a party of 8 or more, if the hostess can find a way to seat you she will do so without seeming to annoyed by it. That was not the case with the hostess on the night we visited. We planned a last min dinner and had 10 people, and expected it to be a stretch to get seated anywhere together. They had several tables available on the front deck of their restaruant but it took them about 20 min to push them together and let us sit down. Again, not a big deal because we had a big party and did not have a reservation. Overall, the food was really good but it seemed like our whole meal the hostess was staring us down and the waiters were not so happy about our party size... if its such a big issue just say no next time!"

At the beginning I suppose, right?\n\nThey make a pear and gorgonzola stuffed tortellini's that are the best.  Served in butter with pine nuts.  Wow.\n\nAnother winner is the \"Pepperoni Arrostitti\", which are Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Tossed with Golden Raisins and Pine Nuts.  Incredible.\n\nThe pasta is perfect.  I recommend the Orecchiette, because I like the idea of eating little ears, aside from the fact that its entirely delicious in san marzano tomato sauce.\n\nAs a main course, you have to try Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken.  Don't ask why, just try it and send me a thank you note later.  \n\nAnother main course you need to try (but maybe not at the same sitting..  maybe) is the Pollo Scarpariello (Chicken Sauteed with Hot and Sweet Italian Sausage and Yellow and Red Bell Peppers\nin a White Wine Sauce).  Try it, send me a thanks later, same place.\n\nThe meatballs?  What does one say about perfection?  When I went there, the waiter brought us out a couple meatballs without us asking for them.  I said \"We didn't order these\".  He said \"Try them.  You don't like them, they're on me.\"  Well, they were gone when he came back 20 minutes later to check on us.  Enough said.\n\nThe Italian Ricotta Cheese Cake is sweet, but not too sweet, as is the Cannoli.  Both go perfect with the coffee, espresso, or some anisette.  You really can't go wrong with this place.\n\nAnd why is it decorated like Christmas all year round?  Because the previous owner one year decided to leave the decorations up after the holidays, and never took them down again (at the NYC location).  Its in tribute to him.  \n\nOh, and if you see a huge ox of a man at the front, thats Tiny.  Say hi, but be nice.  The desert is a big place my friend."

It was offering an array of several choices including dead-ahead NYC red sauce Italian fare.  And, that is exactly what we received.  What I had was delicious.\n\nWe began with very good bread and butter, which for me was followed by an excellent House Salad that included radicchio, white cucumber, bright red tomato, lettuce consisting of fresh crisp mixed greens, Red Onions, and a very tasty light Italian vinaigrette.  Meanwhile, Diane devoured her gooey Mozzarella in Carrozza, which was just what a diner would want to receive for an appetizer of fried mozzarella.\n\nFor an entr\u00e9e I was presented with Spaghetti and Meatballs, or more correctly Spaghetti and Meatball.  But the quite large 6 oz. meatball--constructed of a mixture of beef, veal, and pork--truly delivered excellent flavor, along with the tasty Marinara Sauce that was generously ladled over it and al dente spaghetti.  Uncle Vincent's Famous Lemon Chicken was good, too, but the lemon flavor was strong, tart, and a bit overpowering for those not overly fond of lemon.  The Roasted Potatoes accompanying this dish were simply great.\n\nThe service staff was extremely friendly and helpful, except our busboy briefly fell down on the job by forgetting to replace removed silverware even after our entrees arrived.  Our helpful and extremely knowledgeable waitress stepped in to correct the error, and enable us to continue on a fine gustatory adventure.\n\nFor dessert, creamy Cheesecake was very satisfying accompanied by plump and juicy blueberries, although for Restaurant Week it was in rounded rather than classic form as a junior version of the classic V-shaped wedge.  And, Diane enjoyed her small Tiramisu.\n\nIt was a memorable meal, and I look forward to returning to Caesars Palace soon for another Rao's meatball fix and trying other attractive menu items here."

We went here for our anniversary dinner because my hubby read an article online about the original Rao's in New York City.  Apparently, at that location, reservations are nearly impossible to come by, it's constantly packed and they're doing so well they don't even bother to be open on the weekends . . . all this info I got second-hand from the hubs so if you find some of it a little exaggerated, my apologies! :)\n\nAbout Rao's Las Vegas in Ceasar's Palace:\n\nService: \nWe had a reservation, arrived on time and they sat us right away.  Our waiter, Sean, showed up shortly after we were seated, was very friendly and explained the specials.  He was very honest about  what he liked and didn't care for as much on the menu and helped us make really good food choices. (which i will describe below!) When making the reservation, my husband had sent an email telling them it was our anniversary so everyone who came to our table wished us a happy anniversary and they even remembered the name of our daughter (who wasn't with us) which I guess the hubs had mentioned in his email! The waiter and other staff was very attentive to our needs  but there was really nothing extra that we needed b/c they took care of everything.  \nAs a side note, the have a photographer there that goes around taking pics and tries to sell them to you after you're done eating.  We didn't buy them, but she did do a good job.  \nOh, and I can't forget the owner, I guess his name is Rao and he is the son of the guy who originally started the restaurant.  He also knew it was our anniversary, and gave us two cookbooks that he had autographed for us.  He was a very sweet and humble guy ( unlike some chef/restaurant owners you meet).\n\nFood: \nOMG the food. It was ridiculous!  I am a huge italian food fan, particularly red sauces, and of course, the best I've ever had was in Florence, Italy. Since then, I have never been able to find a red sauce that good.  Rao's has it.  \nFor an appetizer, we ordered the meatballs. You get two baseball-size meatballs, cooked to perfection and smothered in marinara sauce.  The meatballs were tender and flavorful all the way through and the sauce was smooth, silky, garlicky, basil-ly (which is not a word, but who cares). I'm  gonna dream about those meatballs. The recipe is in the cookbook we got so you better believe I'm gonna try my hand at making them at home . . . i think they use beef, italian sausage and veal. We also ordered the parmesan risotto balls, which were a special that night. They came with more marinara sauce, were nice and crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle and just yummy.  /but if you can only pick one appetizer, get the meatballs.\n\nWine: We ordered the chianti classico, which was delicious and went well with everything else we had.\n\nMain courses: Like i said, i love red sauce so i was tempted to get the spaghetti bolognese. Our waiter, though, told us that although it was good, he recommended the spaghetti and meatballs more. Since id already had meatballs, i decided to go with the ravioli purses ....and I'm so glad i did. It was amazing. You get a plate of ravioli purses filled with ricotta cheese and barlett pears, topped with cranberries, sage leaves (which i think might have been seared in oil or something because they were crispy and delicious) and a brown butter sauce. Now, if you've ever had butter sauces, you know they can sometimes be overly greasy, this one was perfect. Not too oily and full of flavor.\nThe hubs got the chicken scarpariello . . .for the life of me, I don't understand why anyone would go to an italian restaurant and not order pasta, but whatevs! LOL It was chicken, italian sausage and a variety of peppers in a white wine sauce. It was the mostly highly recommended (by our waiter) chicken dish on the menu. I didn't taste it myself but hubby said it was delicious but he admitted he liked my pasta better. ;)\n\nDessert: I was going to order the cannoli but the waiter said, \"may I make a suggestion?\" LOL yet again . . . so we ended up ordering the strawberry shortcake, which was my second choice anyway.  So glad we listened to our waiter again . . .the shortcake was actually an authentic style scone, slightly sweet, the strawberries were marinated, sweet, fresh and cold (but not frozen) the ice cream was perfect and it was topped with whipped cream.  So yummy! Oh, and they wrote Happy Anniversary around the rim of the bowl with chocolate sauce, which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nI can't finish without mentioning the ambiance . . . It was so anti-Vegas and I loved it!! Old NYC style, pics of celebrities and random people on the walls, dark wood paneling and a cozy, comfortable yet upscale vibe. And even though its located inside Ceasar's Palace, the storefront and \"outdoor\" seating area look almost exactly like the original location in NYC. Very cool.\n\nOverall, excellent experience and superb food!"

Caprese salad was small but the buffalo mozzarella was tasty..nothing special though. The meat balls were phenomenal and thy was the saving grace of this place. For $17 I thought we would get more than 2 meatballs but I went here expecting it to be expensive. The lemon chicken was the absolute worst I have ever had. I don't mind when bones are in the chicken but when you leave the rib bones in then butcher the cchicken, you are left with tiny pieces of bone in everything. It was terrible taste and extremely hard to eat with all the bone pieces in it. $28 for half a chicken with loads of bone...no thanks. $30 for a normal size portion of spaghetti bolognese. All in all, cute ambiance and good service but certainly would not be coming back or recommending to anyone."

My friend tried the \"famous lemon chicken\" and it tasted like dry, plain bone in chicken with lemon juice squeezed on top. Utter Crap. I had the waiter replace my dish with the cheesy vodka pasta and it was good but the meat was scarce and tasteless. The meat balls were good, but not amazing. The table bread was also cold instead of fresh baked which I didn't care for.\n\nThis food isn't very good, and it hurts even more when you get the bill."

It was one of the best Italian resturats I have been to.  It wasn't super busy when we got there, so the staff was pretty attentive.  I asked to have a table in the replica room when I originally made the reservations.  It was awesome!  I loved the old style look.  It was a little dark, but we used our phone flashlights when we needed to. \n\nWe started off with the Mozzarella Carrozza.  They were like two giant fried cheese triangles.  They were perfectly breaded and the mozzarella was rich and creamy.  The marinara sauce was pretty tasty too - very fresh and flavorful.\n\nFor our entrees, hubby had the Veal Parm and I had the Penne Vodka w/Meatballs on the side.  Seriously, the veal was HUGE!!  And bone in!!!  It was so tender that hubby was cutting it with his fork.  The penne was cooked to a perfect al dente and the vodka sauce was heavanly.  I have become a big fan of Vodka sauce, so I've had it in a few resturants and this has to be one of the best, if not the best.  I thought it was pretty cool the way they presented it.  The waiter came to the table and plated it from the pan that it was cooking in.  The real star of the evening was the meatballs.  They melted in your mouth like butter.  We were actually taking slices off of them with our forks.  We were so stuffed, but I felt horrible having so much left over, so we over ate...again.  We didn't finish them, but couldn't take them with us, it was really a damn shame.  \n\nNo room for dessert this time, which is shocking since I LOVE sweets.  I think next time we'll scale it back so we can try the cheesecake.  Hubby was very grateful that I set this up for us.  We will definately return.  Cheers!"

I had wanted something more upscale with a menu that is accommodating as I am a vegetarian but my fellow travelers are not. \n\nMy reservation had been made for 6:45PM, as nothing was available between 7 and 8 PM. We arrived to the restaurant close to 7, after being held up waiting on transportation. I was nervous that they would cancel the reservation and I'd miss out, but we had no problem when we got to the restaurant.\n\nWe were seated at a table in the New York replica room. Our server was Shaun A, who was very attentive and accommodating - he was always quick to refill waters and gave us plenty of time to review menus and enjoy our meal and time together. I enjoyed the ambiance and it did was easy to forget that you were in a busy restaurant as it was not noisy nor did it have a crowded feeling.\n\nI had a caprese salad to start, which had the freshest mozzarella I've been able to experience thus far. I followed it up with the ravioli purses, after seeing many raves. The dish is so flavorful, and it was actually hot - unlike food you'll find at most restaurants today. Upon being brought to the table, a member of my group commented that it was a good portion - it certainly looks that way, but it is deceiving! This little bites are very filling, and sweet. As much as I wanted to continue eating them due to them being good, I was unable to. \n\nOthers in my group ordered the meatballs, which received great reviews. One had the house salad, remarking that it was the best salad he had ever eaten (he is no salad connoisseur, but it did appear to have a good mix of flavors). He also had rave reviews about the pork chop he had ordered and the potatoes. \n\nWe opted not to order dessert. The menu was very appealing, but none of us could continue eating. I was brought a tiramisu, however, which was phenomenal. I don't eat tiramisu that often, but this one was again full of flavor and topped with a good quality cocoa and one I would order.\n\nOur bill ended up coming out to around $68 per person. We could cut this cost down some on a future visit by sharing entrees as they are very filling. Two in the group ordered meatballs, for example, but could only manage to eat one each and myself and another each consumed about half of our ravioli purses. The restaurant allows for sharing without any hassle, even encouraging it for some items. \n\nI am really happy that I opted to book at Rao's and that it did not disappoint. It will definitely be considered for future visits and recommended to others."

My veal chop was so pre cooked and then microwaved and not even microwaved properly at that. It was barely Luke warm. 23.00 for a plain bowl of ziti with maranara sauce. I would be fine with that if everything else was acceptable but it certainly was not. \nI know good Italian food, I used to eat lunch at a little joint in Hillside NJ called M&M Pizzaria run by a guy called Vito. He made the best Eggplant in the world, and I mean it. I order eggplant wherever I travel to and none have come close. Good Italian food does not have to be at a big fancy restaurant, Vito rates up there with the best of them including Il Mulino's, il Gabianos etc. That is in certain dishes, for the basics Vito can't be beat. Which is more than I can say about Raos! It was the second worst meal I had in Vegas and in the top 10 worst I had in my life, for a $162.00 no less. The worst meal was Aureole at the Mandalay, it was completely unedible and the manager would not even charge us after what I can only assume tasting some of the dishes that were served to us.  We each returned our original main course selections and then the manager graciously offered to make us different second dishes which were worst than the first dishes. \n\nIt was so very disappointing since the restaurant as a whole is beautiful and the Swan room is a special place. So you sit there expecting greatness and end up with an Olive Garden meal gone bad, no make that a Sabaro's meal gone bad. Raos came in a close second just to put  it in perspective how bad it is.\n\nMy theory on dinning holds true. Number one if you walk into a Restaurant during prime time and it's not packed it's a good bet the food is not good, second if you walk into a gourmet restaurant and they serve you cold bread it's a good bet the food is not good. If you encounter either of these situations do yourself a favor and get up and leave.\n\nThis place doesn't even deserve 1 star but Yelp won't let you post unless you select at least one star. Aureole is a negative 5 star."

Very salty...\n\nNext came the Liguine with clams...this is an Italian restaurant right???? Well the linguine was undercooked...I'm not even kidding.  The noodles were not cooked.  To make matters worse the white wine sauce was tasteless and clams were barely average.  How is this even possible??? Amateur cooks can do better.  Took a few bites and had enough.  \nMy girlfriend got the Ravioli and she said it tasted like something from a Chef Boyardee can.  Absolutely underwhelming.\n\nI had another course coming but by this point I was so upset that I got the bill, paid for it and left.  \n\nThe bill for me alone came to over $65 USD.  This had to have been the worst meal I've had in years.  \n\nTo make matters worst the outside chef that was organizing everything seemed annoyed I had said the meal was awful.  He didn't look to make anything right.  \n\nAvoid this place.\n\nEdit: reading the reviews here is laughable.  I cannot believe there is such a massive difference in experiences.

The roasted red peppers alone would be great too.\n\nThen, share/sample the Pasta in Vodka sauce and the Meat Balls (huge savory moist meat).\n\nThey say they are famous for the Lemon Chicken...but we had the Veal.  If you do the above, stick with the Veal Chop with Cherry Peppers.   We did the Veal Chop and the Veal Parmesan (which is also fabulous - so much melted cheese it looks like a pizza)!  But the contrast of the veal chop to the pasta and meatball is really superb!\n\nNo room for dessert...but go win some money - you're in Vegas, baby!\n\nRao's - please open up a location in Los Angeles."

I've experienced better\" is right.\n\nNothing personal Rao's, but being a huge fan of Italian food, you were not the best; you weren't even very close, and yes I've had Italian food all over LA, Vegas, and New York.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the decor and feel of this place, but our server was a little on the pretentious side, as were his recommendations, and the restaurant's pricing. The price you pay for the quality you receive is pretty outrageous, even for Vegas.\n\nOf all the items ordered, the only thing that truly stood out was the meatball everyone talks about. They can sure make a good meatball. But all the pasta dishes were average, the antipasti dish was just okay, and the wine list while decent in selection, was close to double and/or triple what we have paid at other Vegas restaurants, and in New York. \n\nI really wanted to love you.

The kitchen is also partially open so you can see your meal being prepared if you are sitting at the bar.\n\nRao's doesn't feel like you are in Vegas but when you go to Vegas make sure you stop in for dinner ( I don't think they do lunch service anymore)."

Fantastic combination of beef, pork, and veal that give a buttery texture and fantastic flavor.  \n\nThe downside is that we ordered too much food.  The pasta dishes are entree sized, which would be good to explain, as traditional Italian restaurants with multiple courses typically downsize the portions so you can enjoy all courses.  Our pastas (Shells with Ricotta and Spaghetti Bolognese) were very, very good, but simply too much food.  \n\nWe compounded our error by ordering a single entree to share (Osso buco), and this was good.  Just good, not great.  \n\nIt this was the whole story, then my summary would be high quality food but overpriced and portions were too large.  Unfortunately, we then had an incident with a server dropping a plate with marinara sauce near our table, and the associated shrapnel hitting my wife and myself.  Initially, it did not seem that bad, and the first response was for an employee to come with a stain stick and club soda.  The first response was quick and helpful, and the employee who dropped the plate came to apologize (mistakes happen, don't sweat it), but eventually it was clear that the sauce had really hit my wife's blouse and pants pretty badly, and by this time, the waiter had brought our check with no adjustment but a comp dessert (which we were too full to eat).  The lady with the stain stick then just left us an almost empty one because \"she was too busy\".    \n\nEventually (with no complaint or prompting by us) the manager did in fact make things right comping the meal, which we appreciated, but this or something similar should have been done as soon as it was clear that the problem was as bad as it was. Bringing us a $200 check and running my AMEX was unnecessary, even when the bill was credited eventually.  The manager did offer to take care of dry cleaning but we were leaving the following day so that would not work.  She did give us her card and invited us back, which was appreciated.\n\nBottom line, it's expensive, but the meatballs are among the best I have ever experienced and the food is very good - just don't order too much.  Our waiter (Jimmy) was outstanding and I think he was a little embarased that management did not move more quickly, but like us he was satisfied that they made it right (and we did tip Jimmy anyway).  What I really hope is that they did not fire the server who dropped the plate.  Mistakes happen - they just look worse with red sauce."

Based on fellow yelpers we ordered the beet salad which was very fresh, meatballs that were light and not overly seasoned, lemon chicken that was succulent and with a hint of lemon and dessert with cake and berries.

Rao's in NY has some sort of crazy reservation system in which it's a two year wait list so the one In Vegas is your only shot without a reservation.\n\nWhen we went there my girlfriend and I were greeted by this nice older dude who I presume was the manager siting in the corner taking a break (I think). We were seated quickly and had good service throughout the meal.\n\nI have tried different chicken parmigiana, but have never found one I liked. When I saw on the menu that Rao's had Veal Parmigiana (I've heard that's how it's traditionally made) I had to try. The idea of breading and frying something, then covering it with melted mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce sounds so delicious to me, but I have just come to accept that it's just not for me. Nothing wrong with the meat itself, in fact I was surprised at how big the portion was, I just find this dish is always to salty for me, no matter which restaurant I try it at. One thing about Rao's Parmigiana dish is that it does not come with a side of pasta, all you get is the veal (huge bummer). My girlfriend had the pasta shells with, I believe was, ricotta and marinara sauce. It was really good and I wished I had gotten that instead. \n\n The reason I give this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because while the food is delicious and is some of the better Italian fair that I have ever had, it did not blow my mind like I had hoped it would or how Food Network's \"Throwdown with Bobby Flay\" portrayed it as the holy grail of Italian food. If I am ever near the Las Vegas area again though, I will surely give this place another shot."

We started with a Fritto Misto, which is a generous sized platter made up of fried calamari, shrimp, cod fish, and zucchini which was great until the middle & was extremely salty and had a fishy aftertaste; we returned it. The chef agreed that it was too salty and that they use rock salt. We then had a Cesar's Salad which was average. My boyfriend had the steak with a side if Pizzaiola that he was greatly disappointed with because it was mostly onion and is called Pizzaiola because it is supposed to more of a \"Pizza sauce\" with more tomato than anything and the steak also tasted too salty. I had the Penne Vodka which was actually the only dish I enjoyed. Unfortunately, my boyfriend was sick from all the salt we had from the Fritto Misto which we ate as an appetizer that he was not able to enjoy the rest of his food. \n\nMy bf was then was asked by a server if the he was enjoying his food and laughed at him after my bf said \"No and that he was feeling sick.\" I felt a little sick as well because of the overdose of salt and fishy aftertaste from the appetizer.

Both wine and beer are overpriced, but that is part of being in Las Vegas.  \n\nPizzas were about 8 to 10 inches--all were personal pizzas.  The size wasn't so much the issue as was how they were dressed.  In other restaurants, their pizzas would have been classified as appetizers rather than entrees.  \n\nMy biggest complaint has to do with the meatball entree.  For lunch, this included 1 large meatball, but it didn't come with anything at all--no pasta, no salad, no bread, nothing.  WHO orders a meatball and NOTHING ELSE?  What was worse was the sneaky way the server tacked on what was less than a half-order of pasta to make it a meal...for an extra $13!  I actually don't think the meatball may have cost that much.\n\nIn a place like Las Vegas, famous for gourmet all-you-can-eat buffets, Rao's is NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.  Small portions, service that deliberately did not disclose information about the menu, and a much larger than warranted bill at the end of the experience was enough to keep me searching for a better deal and better food."

This dish combines chicken, hot & sweet sausages, and peppers in a yummy sauce. I have never had another dish that I have enjoyed as much as this one!  It was just as good as I remember it from our 2010 visit to Rao's.  The penne vodka was very good and the ravioli was very flavorful.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive through-out the meal.

It seems as if  these guys have been living on name alone or they were having a REALLY off night.\n\nAlso, we told them we were in a rush and they didn't really change their already inattentive service. I guess they get enough business regardless where they can not care about their service and their food.\n\nOh and we made a reservation for 13 but only 11 of us showed up. They charged us for 13 anyway because \"that's our policy.\"\n\nWill never ever ever go back again and highly recommend spending your money at the other 50 spots in vegas with better food or..going to in n out. \n\np.s. My roomate makes better meatballs at home. OVERRATED."

Honestly I absolutely love the sauce Rao's and think it is one of the best jar sauce out there on the market.  So I mean if I love the jar sauce, then even if I am not eating at the original Rao's the carbon copy in Vegas has to be good, right?  Not exactly, the atmosphere was beautiful, we ate outside overlooking the Caesar pool, the sun was setting and it was really romantic.  They serve you warm crispy on the outside soft on the inside bread and have olive oil for dipping.  Love that!!  The wait staff was very friendly and really took the time to recommend some famous dishes.  OK so they serve family style, which means enough for two to four people to share.  Perfect.  So their are four of us, we order the fried mozzarella appetizer, two Caesar salads, side of meatballs, veal parm and one person who doesn't eat meat orders the pasta with red clam sauce.  The verdict...the mozzarella appetizers was good, sauce thick but not like my Rao's in the jar.  Weird I think...the Caesars classic.  The meatballs were so disappointing.  Rubbery and not flavorful.  Reminded me of the ones that you can buy in the frozen food isle of your local supermarket.  The veal parm wasn't that good either, the breading was too thick and the mozz wasn't melted enough, not enough sauce.  The pasta with red clam sauce looked good and they seemed to enjoy it all.\n\nWe didn't go for dessert so I can't comment on that, but they do have a store in the front of the restaurant where you can buy Rao's products and cookbooks.  Very cool, but we have this here.  OK so we met this woman who has been to the original Rao's and said that this one is just as good.  Well we had to disagree stating the sauce is nothing like the sauce in the jar, so get this.  She tells us that is because Rao's just uses their name and they do not make the sauce.  Who knew, but have to say that jar sauce is so damn good.  I didn't care who makes it.  So if you want Italian, want the hype that Rao's has become being unattainable in Manhattan then I would say sure make a reservation and enjoy the Vegas but hey you were forewarned."

Our water glasses and coffee cups were never close to being empty. Wine and Cheesecake dessert topped it all off.  We were staying at Cesars, however I would recommend Rao's as a good Italian Restaurant even if you are staying elsewhere in LV.  It's worth the trip into the casino!"

It left us having to do a lot of math to try and split up our own check and after an hour of trying to do that our check still ended up being short and someone had to pay ten extra dollars for their meal. On top of that they only allowed 6 debits cards?! A girl didn't know what to do at our table because all she brought was a debit card to pay with. For a restaurant in the middle of Caesars palace Las Vegas, they need to learn how to split up the checks. By the end of the meal everyone was frustrated with having spent an extra hour there trying to split up the check that it ruined everyone's evening. Everyone ended up fighting with each other over the check issue and it just wasn't worth it. When we talked to the manager about it she was extremely rude and didn't even help us. I mean geez the least she could do was give us a free bottle of wine or something. Absolutely ridiculous and everyone should avoid this restaurant by all means. I'll never be returning."

Caesar's opened and we were there.....and finally we got our own in Los Angeles that we visit often and enjoy.   The issue with the dinner we had at Caesar's Place on Tuesday, October 13, 2016 with 6PM reservations for 5 adults is this;  We spent almost $425 to celebrate my Sisters 50th wedding anniversary.  When we were reviewing the menus and options for the evening, I had seen a plate go by that didn't look familiar and asked our waiter what it was and he responded \"we can do anything you want with pasta and sauces.\"  Great answer....I thought!   One of the specials that day was Chicken Parmesan which I love and ordered.  I was told it came with spaghetti and marinara sauce and asked for penne or rigatoni instead.  Our waiter informed me that the Chef would not change the pasta on this dish but i could order a side dish for an additional charge and I asked why and was told that was \"the rule.\"  Well, this is truly not acceptable.   I kindly spoke with a Manager and was informed the same thing.  Feeling defeated and not understanding the issue with placing penne on the plate instead of spaghetti with the same sauce made no sense.   Our meal was spectacle as always but the taste left in our mouth ruined the evening for me and my Guests.   More bad news came when the bill arrived.   $44 for the chicken parmesan with spaghetti.  $44 for a slab of pounded chicken...which was delicious and 4oz of spaghetti and I couldn't have a penne with it instead.   Will we return....uncertain.   If a simple request, in a world class restaurant can not be made, then it might be time to revisit your customer base and what message this sends.  (this is not a fast food Italian restaurant.  The restaurant was not busy as usual due to our early arrival time and to think that the kitchen could not handle a simple change is disturbing."

The waiter took the orders in a clockwise manner around the table, and did not take the ladies first, which I find inappropriate for a nice meal. \n\nFor as in a hurry as he was to take the orders, there was a lot of snappiness in the service. I have no problem with a nice slow paced meal, but this was not that. We waited an extraordinary amount of time to receive our check, too. If I remember correctly, we got stuck with a 20% auto-tip too. I don't mind auto-tip for parties over 6, but let's not assume 20%, okay?\n\nThe food was good, but not great. My veal was not particularly tender, which seems like would be the signature of veal. I paid the same amount for a lamb dish at Circo days later and they weren't even in the same league.\n\nI had high hopes after seeing and hearing so much about Rao's, but I left very disappointed and I wouldn't recommend Rao's to you.
