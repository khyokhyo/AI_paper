The waiter even wrote Jain in front of the items (so I suppose they might be getting a lot of Jain customers)\n\nWe ordered the following Jain items this time.\nMalai Paneer\nYellow Daal\nMutter Paneer\n\nThe last time (around 2 years ago) they also made Jain Malai Kofta (during dinner)\n\nI have been to this place around 4 times and its always a saviour :)\n\nThis time around they were very busy so the service sucked (its not like this always), but yes sometimes we take the buffet, so not much service is required anyways. We could see several people waiting to be seated and they were also getting a little bit frustrated.\n\nWould definitely recommend this place for good Jain food."

They show the nice lounge area (which is NOT where they seat you for dinner).  The lounge area was nice, but it wasn't open at all when I was there. (and I left at 10pm)\n\nThe food was pretty good.  I couldn't believe that the entrees didn't come with Naan or anything.  Everything (Dal, Naan, etc.) had to be ordered a la carte (for an extra charge).  We ordered the Naan and Roti which only came with four pieces each. \n\nMaybe I'm just used to going to places where the Naan is free and you get it by the basket-load.\n\nI would definitely go back again if I wanted Indian food while in Vegas.\n\nThe service was excellent too.  Very attentive and quick."

I have to say, the items were in Indian so I had no idea about a few items that I was eating but since I'm adventurous like that, I put a teeny bit of whatever I didn't know and then decided if I wanted seconds. Certain items were a tad spicy but not enough to ruin your meal if you're sensitive to heat. The Tandoori Chicken, which always tends to be dry, was super juicy, the Curry Chicken was fragrant and addicting. The Rice was soft and fluffy and they give u a basket of Naan for your table. I may have been the only Spanish person here, lol, everyone else was Indian, I love that, very telling AND promising. The price is right, $14 for a very clean, well maintained, hot meal. If you want a hearty, savory meal this would be the place to go. Vegas wants to attack your pocket and serve u junk, but this place is the real deal. I would DEFINITELY go back."

Staying a little off the Strip was nice, however, getting food is always a pain in the ass due to constant tourist everywhere. We decided we should try somewhere close that, preferably. wouldn't have very many tourists. Bring in Tamba. \n\nWe made a reservation thinking the place would be jam packed, however, it was not. We were seated immediately, not having to wait at all because the place wasn't crowded at all. \n\nTheir Chicken Tikka Masala was amazingly good. This is one of my favorite dishes, so I enjoy when I go to an Indian place that really makes it the way I like it. Their Naan was also delicious. We got the garlic naan, as well as the Alu Naan, which was also VERY good. \n\nI'd definitely go here again if I am in the area. It is somewhat off the beaten path. I don't think the tourist have really found this gem of a restaurant."

Normally I don't go out of my way to eat fish, however the fish in the meat sample platter was cooked perfectly with a light crust and a lot of flavor without a \"fishy\" taste. The lamb was very tender and didn't have excessive fat either. We had the Garlic Naan, Tikka Masala with chicken, curry with Lamb, and a spinach curry with rice and Mango Lassi drinks. All of the meat was very tender and the spices were perfect. We also ended up getting the mango and pistachio ice cream which I was pleasantly surprised at how creamy it was.\n\nOur server was very kind and he seemed like he was happy to serve us. He always kept our waters full at all times without being overbearing. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience at a classy Indian restaurant with a polite server and exceptional food! I would definitely recommend trying it on your next visit to the Strip!"

There were lots of \"ethnic\" types which is always a good sign.\nThe chicken curry, tandoori chicken and spiced cauliflower and potatoes were excellent. The naan was good and the dhaal and sambhar were actually not good. So there you have it.\nAlso there was no drink included with the meal for $12.99 which if fine. But what I found quite annoying was that you had to prepay and then if you wanted anything other than water, pay again. This did not make me happy.\n\nExc -Curry, Tandoori Chicken, spiced veggies.\nGood - Decor\nAve - Food\nPoor - Paying policy \n\nWOULD I GO BACK? Probably not.

All the food just sits around. \n\nOn that note, Me and my boyfriend went and ate here about a week ago bc a friend I had in my summer class at UNLV worked here.  Although he wasn't there that night we went anyways and everyone was so nice.  The service was excellent and the food was fantastic.  I completely disagree with the yelp from Sang whatever bc we ordered the Chicken tikka masala and it was awesome.  We also got the lamb vindaloo and the combo together was phenomenal.  The chicken tikka was so buttery and had a great flavor while the lamb vindaloo had the perfect amount of heat.  We had samosas of course and they were pretty good.  From my memory I've had better but everything else was delicious.  Our water was never empty and everyone was so nice.  We also had some dessert, a round cake like ball thing (dont know what its called) and some carrots.  Very good as well.  \n\nThe location is a little strange (I thought it was closed when we were going there) but they were open.

Strangely placed on the second level of a nearly empty strip mall along the Strip, you might not know it was there. Beautiful inside with soft Indian music playing, this was a place I could forget that I was in Las Vegas and enjoy delicious curry. I shared the goat curry with my husband since the serving size easily serves 2 reasonable appetites along with rice and naan. The naan bread was delicious! The curry had a nice light spice and was probably a bit too salty, but I still loved it. The lime ginger soda was unexpectedly tasty too. I could see going back here a few more times if I were stuck here longer. The waitstaff was attentive too, though there weren't many diners. \n\nOkay, this isn't a place I would typically give 5 stars, but it was just what I needed at the time.

We shared a main of prawns in a flavorful red pepper curry with basmati rice.  Each dish was spot-on with a balance of flavor and spice.

Or loads of carbs everywhere. And then at Tamba's buffet I got really really good food; hugely filling. The dessert - gulab jamun which many people get wrong (too dense or in thick stale sugar syrup) was perfect as well.\nAlthough the 'katories' or styrofoam bowls I took the curries in were flimsy, they helped me taste everything separately and not have everything mixed in my plate. I liked that.\nThe entry to this place made us doubt it but then we saw it was full of people having good good food. I liked the no-fuss atmosphere of the place too.

How could a \"mild\" requested Navratna Korma turn up spicey. This dish is made sweet all throught Mumbai. Not here. Not even upon special request.\n\nService by a certain server named Anand (tall guy, grey hair) was much below par. The only the only thing he did promptly was to take the initial order. For every thing else (water, soda, extra naan) we had to raise our hand in hope that this server would notice and come to the table.\n\n\nWe even had to wait long to get the check and the receipt. All this on a Tuesday night - not weekend.\n\nWhen I tipped him apt to the service reveived (it was not zero. There was still some tip). This server totally lost his cool and started shouting abusive language in front of my kids. \n\nNot coming back here. Not even in a decade. Would prefer McDonald's to this place.\n\nAdvice for the Anand (the server). You are in the wrong profession. Hospitality is not about expcting good returns for bad service. It is certainly not about shouting bad language to your customer for the tip you receive."

I cook a lot at home because its not easy finding restaurants to eat at, especially in Las Vegas, the steakhouse capital of the world. I decided I needed to get out for Valentine's Day and chose to go Indian. I came across Tamba's amazing website and easily made up my mind. After making the reservation I read a few revues on Google and they worried me a bit, but I wasn't going to be shaken. I'm so glad I stayed with it, I loved this place. Staff was very friendly and the food was delicious! We tried the Bhel Puri for an appetizer, based off of the waiters recommendation, great choice. Then for entrees we went with the Aloo Gobi & Chana Masala. Both were amazing and complimented each other nicely, great for sharing. She went with a glass of house Chard, which turned out to be Mondavi(Nice!) and I tried one of the many Indian Imported beers. Hayward 5000 was the beer I went with and was perfect. Gotta find that at Lee's Discount Liquor, hope they have it. \n\nOne side note, when they ask you for bread, it's not included. That was awkward. Also, parking is a bit rough.\n\nOver all this was probably one of the least expensive Vday dinners I've ever had and also one of the most satisfying."

First, we were looking for a Greek place, but didn't find any with decent reviews, so since we have had good luck with Indian food in the past, I figured I'd scour Yelp for suggestions.  I found Tamba to be in the top five on Yelp and found every place in the list to have mixed reviews.  After looking at the web sites of the top five, their menus and plenty of thought, I finally decided on Tamba.  I used opentable.com to make our reservation for 7pm Saturday night.  Since this place is in the Hawaiian Marketplace on the strip, I figured it would be packed.  In fact, one of the reviews said to make sure you get a reservation or your wait could exceed two hours.\n\nWhen we arrived, the place was pretty empty.  I believe there were only four or five tables taken at that point, so we were greeted by the manager and he wished my girlfriend a happy birthday.  Nice touch.  \n\nI am actually glad the place was empty because the waiter spent a lot of time talking over the menu options and giving us recommendations.  During our conversation with the waiter, we talked about the lamb dishes and he could tell we were hesitant, so he brought over sample for us to try.  It was so good, I chose the Roghan Gosht as my main dish.  My girlfriend chose the Butter Chicken and we started with the Sea Bass appetizer.  On the spice scale, I'd say the lamb was a 5 out of 10 and the butter chicken was a 3.\n\nThe wine selection was average, but my girlfriend really enjoyed the fruity martini.\n\nThe price was better than I expected for dinner on the strip in Las Vegas.  We both had two drinks, an appetizer, two main dishes, rice, garlic nan and two desert items and got out of there for around $70 and that included the tip.  \n\nTwo more signs that Tamba serves good Indian food; by the time we left (8:30ish), the place was packed and there were a lot of actual Indian people dinning there.\n\nWe both said that we would go back."

Usually, it's associated with trying to make more from you off something else (once they get you in), or just offering you something at a discount because it was way overpriced to begin with.  Then there are those deals that are so low because it's crappy food (like many of the prime rib specials.) Well, Tamba doesn't fit into any of those categories, but they have a genuine deal: a $12.95 lunch buffet!\n\nAnd it's not the type of buffet that you're accustomed to running away from.  There are a variety of reasons I stay away from buffets these days, but Indian buffets tend to be an exception. Quality food, and wait for it...fresh food. Shocker!  I had salad with mint chutney, potatoes, rice, marsala, chicken tandoori, and a few other things I can't all remember.  Most of the items contain a description above it, but when I was struggling, one of the employees noticed and gave me a suggestion in a kind matter.  He didn't make me feel dumb at all for not knowing what some things were.\n\nIt's a pretty nice restaurant too, quite large and relaxing ambience, really dim.  It's nice to feel relaxed at a buffet, rather then rushing through buffet lines or worrying that the person in front of you is gonna get it before you.  There was none of that here (at least when I went).  I'm surprised it wasn't more crowded on a Sunday afternoon, but I'm not going to complain.

VERY tasty.   When he first put down the dish I figured I'd eat about half of it, but I polished it off and would have continued eating if there had been more...

This made ordering very easy for me. While there were several options, I decided on the following:\n\nKali Dal (slow cooked Black Lentils and spices) http://su.pr/7Wv21z\nVeggie Samosas (about 5 or 6 pieces) http://su.pr/2wAdc9\nTandoori Roti - whole wheat flat bread\nBasmati Rice\n\nOne sad thing about take out is that the presentation is not as elegant. However, it smelled good, it tasted good, and I was happy. My friends were definitely peering over at my food. I even gave away one of my tasty Veggie Samosas.

Unlike most Indian restaurants in Vegas, the cooks at Tamba don't focus on a bland tourist palate.  And as a result, they don't produce spice-less offerings.\n\nWhat the buffet does offer is an amazing array of vegetarian options--tasty, spicy and delicious options--chana masala (chick pea masala), palak paneer and various other vegetable-based deliciousness.  But the buffet isn't solely for the vegetable lover.  The Tamba buffet also carries several chicken dishes in well-crafted sauces.  If you've eaten at a few Vegas Indian buffets, you'll know that tasty and spicy foods are rare.  So if you're near the south side of the strip for lunch, you can't do much better.\n\nAs for the dinner or regular dishes (not in buffet form), I haven't tried them, but several India-born friends have told me that Tamba is the best Indian restaurant in town."

They vary the degree of spicyness, just tell them what you like. I had the Aloo Gobi, which is vegan ny the way. My favorite Indian dish, a potato-cauliflower curry. The portions are pretty big, I took half of it home."

We were happy to find an Indian place on the strip! The ambience was good, location was great and the food tasted ok as well! Upma was very tasty. Idly was very dry - probably because we went around 2:00 pm which was too late for the food to be fresh.\n\nMy main complaint is,the minute we completed our lunch all of us felt extremely drowsy and sleepy. All of us were not up until late evening. We were surprised that all 6 of us felt the same way! Neither we were sleep deprived nor extremely tired to doze off after lunch.\n\nOn sharing this with our friends, we came to know that 12 of our friends had lunch buffet in Tamba sometime in September 2015. Most of them had an upset stomach. \n\nAll other restaurants had a long wait time because of which we chose to go to an Indian place. Had we chosen a different place, we might explored the strip that afternoon instead of warming our beds. \n\nHope this is not happening to anyone else!"

If you can walk or take a taxi, do that instead. \n\nFirst thing that throws us off is the prepay for lunch buffet. I mean, this is the only restaurant I know where you have to prepay for the buffet. Yes, the spread of the dishes is good; that is where we were deceived :(\n\nThe veggie dishes were bland and lacked the flavor and punch of the Indian spices! The 'Malai Kofta' was too salty. The 'saag paneer' lacked paneer and was only a mishmash of spinach; the chole was OK and lacked the punch as well. The Idlis: like rubber! Upma was OK. \n\nFrom the desserts, the Gulab Jamun was OK and the Custard was alright too. But then, he placed small containers to fill them up. We filled our stomachs with mostly the desserts(not a healthy way, I know) and for a high-price of almost $13 per person. \n\nThere are better Indian restaurants, I would recommend. Go to Gandhi's or India Place instead and be treated to some flavorful food and better service.\n\nAnd waiters in Tamba: Grow up and dont play 'Catch ball' when you have customers...and by 'Ball' I mean...you know what?\n\nAnd to end this, I AM NOT GOING THERE AGAIN!"

It is also easy to miss because it is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace Plaza. You have to go into the main building next to the Chili's and just ignore the rundown shops on the first floor as you ascend to the second level where this restaurant is located.  \n\nThey have a good selection of food like naan, butter chicken, basmati rice, tandoori chicken, and some other items. The naan is in the buffet so you can grab as much as you want when you want it! The only downer is that it is plain naan instead of garlic, but it still tastes fine since you can just eat it with the curry for flavor. \n\nI'd recommend checking this place out if you like Indian food and want a change of pace when it comes to eating on the strip. The lunch price with the Yelp discount was about $14-15/ person which isn't too bad considering the food and location. Also, I saw a bunch of Indian people when we walked in so that must mean this place is good! The staff is also very attentive as they refill your drink and take away your plates in a timely manner."

I myself had \"Palak Paneer\" and \"Yellow Rice\". The paneer was excellent and generous portions of tofu. The rice was nearly perfect but just a tad undercooked/dry but worked well as a mix with the paneer wrapped up in fresh nan.\n\nThe dishes and the restaurant are well presented with authentic palettes and decor. The music was subtle an unobtrusive and the waiter was superb.\n\nWhile this restaurant is in Vegas, the prices were a little high than I'd normally expect but are a pretty good deal considering the location. Good deals can be had if you check the normal coupon books. There are specific ones for Tamba that could have saved us a bit.\n\nWith all that said, while the food was excellent, the staff was superb, and the atmosphere was inviting, the restrooms were atrocious. I was pretty shocked considering the dining experience to find the bathrooms somewhat trashed and unkept which worried me a little.\n\nOverall I still give Tamba 4/5, but please folks, take care of those frightening bathrooms and you'd easily be a 5."

The server knew immediately when I raised my phone so it's nice the staff is competent and very friendly. \n\nThe quality of food in comparison to other Indian places around town is a bit sub standard. Especially with respect towards price. They have a nice variety from North to South Indian dishes. Your standard tikka masala meal is there as well as a butter chicken dish aka chicken makkni. \n\nThe naan is very good especially when fresh from the plain to the garlic you can't really go wrong.\n\nThis is a three star review because of poor parking accessibility and quality of food.

The meal came out to $55 with wine!\n\nWine: Bonny Doon Riesling. Something about a sweet white wine pairs nicely with spicy, rich Indian food. This retails for $11 and paid $26 at the restaurant. Not too bad of a mark-up I guess. \n\nEntrees: Tandoori chicken--yum yum. Very generous portion. \nPrawn Makhni--rich buttery cream sauce. On the spicy side. \nChicken Tikka Masala -- another rich flavorful curry. \n3 dishes with rice and garlic nan--the 3 of us were completely stuffed."

First, I dont expect to be amazed by a buffet, and second, i definitely dont expect to be amazed by a buffet that is so cheap (compared to other buffets on the strip). You get a good variety of indian food (mostly vegetarian) and its around $13. What is the funniest thing about this place is where it is located. It is inside a, what seems to be an abandoned food court type building, and is the only that has been running ever since I first came here 4 years ago. Seriously, I have never seen any other store in this food court open. \nI think if you dont mind eating a little unhealthy indian food that tastes decent you should check this place out. I have had their fresh food here once, and honestly this is one place where their fresh food tastes slightly better than their buffet. Usually, the restaurant's fresh food tastes way better than their buffet, but I guess their food quality doesnt change much between ordering off the menu or the buffet."

After finally having eaten there,  I would give this place HALF a star if I could, for its bad food and terrible service!\n\nI live in Silicon Valley---a mecca of Indian restaurants and cafes-- and eat Indian food at least once a week. (It's my latest addiction).  I know good curry when I taste it, and let me tell you now before you waste your time and money: you will not find good curry here.\n\nWe went for the \"dinner buffet\" which, it turns out, \"was reserved for private parties only.\" So we ended up ordering the butter chicken and a lamb curry with some naan off of the menu.  But the waiter brought out what he called \"chicken tikka masala\", and when we told him it wasn't what we ordered, he then said he misspoke and it was actually \"butter chicken\" after all.\n\nEither way, it tasted like water.  No flavor whatsoever.  The lamb curry on the other hand... was a SPOONFUL of SALT with every bite.  YUCK!\n\nI've never abandoned an Indian meal in my life, no matter how mediocre.  But I could not get myself past even half this meal.  Maybe the bland curry juxtaposed to the salty one made it seem even saltier, or, \"Maybe,\" I thought, \"if i mix the two curries together, I would find a happy medium.\"  How wrong I was! There was no happiness to be found there. :(\n\nTo top it off, when our bill came, we were charged $15 for the \"chicken tikka masala\" instead of butter chicken, and told our server about the mistake.  He said, \"It doesn't matter anyway, they're the same price.\"  Indeed not!  I corrected him and said that the butter chicken is $14.  So he responded, \"Fine, I'll just COMP you the difference.\"\n\n\"COMP\"? \"COMP\"??? Are you kidding me?!  You're not comping us anything!  We're just asking you to charge us for what we ACTUALLY ORDERED!  Don't think you're doing us any favors!\n\nFinally, just to add insult to injury, they advertised 10% off the bill if you showed them the ad from the Vegas 24/7 booklet.  But when we gave him the \"coupon\", INSTEAD of taking 10% OFF, he ADDED 18% to our bill for gratuity!\n\nHA! Unbelievable.  I guess, in Vegas,  you don't have to go to the casinos to lose your money!"

Decided on the buffet, and was told that we would have to pay before being seated. Was told the buffet was $40 dollars for two people. Gave the front desk a $100 bill. \n\nTamba Cashier: Do you have anything smaller? \nMe: No, I don't. (I wanted to get the change) \nTC: We can't break this bill. \nMe: So, how will I get my change back? \nTC: Well, we don't have anything else, because everybody else has been paying with $100 bills. \n\nAt this point, I was going to argue with the cashier, talk to the manager, or suggest that they go to one of the other restaurants nearby to break a few hundreds to manageable change for their register, but my date pulled out her wallet and paid the bill. \n\nDuring the meal, asked for a Coke and a lassi, which added another $5.39 to the total bill. Turns out that drinks aren't included in a $20/person buffet. What?  (But water is free, so don't think you can't get a bargain out of Las Vegas.) If the Coke is coming out from a fountain station, is it normal to ask the diner, \"Do you want ice in that?\" \n\nLeaving the restaurant, had the bill for the drinks with me and $6 ready to pay. \n\nMe: Hey, we also got drinks. I'd like to pay up. (Hands the bill and money over.) \nTC: Sir, we don't have any change available and can't give you your $.61 back ... (while holding $1 to give back to me) \nMe: You know what, just keep it. Peace out. \n\nThe food review: We wish that there were tags describing what we were eating. Wanting to try something new, we had passed by Tamba before while walking the Strip, just because we didn't know it was at the Hawaiian Marketplace. Her being vegetarian, Indian food was a good choice since meat isn't so prevalent in the diet.  She says that the food was spicier than what she was prepared for, but there was a nice variety.  As someone who will eat everything, it was a pleasant meal and flavorful.\n\nI understand the need to economize during this economy, but plastic plates for the buffet and plastic cups for water?  And the containers for sauces are little styrofoam bowls?  What an ecological disaster.  For the Coke and lassi, we were given glass tumblers, which was good, I guess.\n\nMy final assessment is that the food was good, but the experience was bad bad bad."

The owners have come to visit us at my work on several occasions so I thought I could at least go and see what it was all about. I knew it was going to be good because it was the only business left in the building (its located inside the Hawaiian Marketplace building by Polo Towers) and there were a ton of Indian people there (always a good sign).Alex was our server. He was very friendly and we left our dinner in his hands....what a smart decision. He brought out an AMAZING prix fixe menu I think of his own creation (nice touch). Now I will do my best to at least describe my favorites:\n\n1) Little fried dough balls with peas and potatoes inside...served with a mint cilantro and some sort of sweet/spicy glaze (tandoori sauce?)\n2) Chicken tandoori....great flavor. Sweet/spicy and BBQ'd to perfection\n3) Lollipop lamb chops with some sort of glaze with a kick (great with the mint cilantro and sweet/spicy sauce mixed together).\n4) Chicken Tikka Masala....HOLY COW! You must get this dish. The curry is mild, its creamy and a little bit of heaven in a dish. \n5) Garlic nan....garlic flat bread which was perfect for dipping in the Chicken Tikka Masala.\n\nI was so happy when we left. My man and I actually went back the following evening because I was craving it again. Just as good the second time and we actually got Alex as our server again...he remembered us from the night before (another nice touch). Will be back again soon."

I am in Vegas quite a bit for work and my coworkers and I are always searching for dinner options that don't require you to win big before you can eat.  Thanks to Open Table, we found this hidden little gem.\n\nThe feeling of the restaurant is pretty generic.  The website gives the impression that you will be walking into a luxurious setting complete with red velvet cushions and dramatic draperies.  Um, not so much, but we clearly weren't looking for trendy so no big deal.\n\nWe had booked a party of 6, which ended up being a party of four.  The host was nice about it, but, unfortunately the restaurant doesn't have too many options for 4-tops so we ended up sitting at a table for six.  I guess they get a lot of large groups?\n\nI started with a manhattan.  When it came out a dark red, I was a little concerned that it wasn't made correctly, but after tasting, it was just right.  I had the butter chicken, which was rich and delicious, but not too heavy.  My friends didn't really know what they wanted so the server just brought out a few different dishes to share.  One of my friends had a spicy chicken dish that was fantastic.  In hindsight, I wish we would have asked what they were.\n\nAll in all, it was a great meal, friendly service, and we were all able to get out of there for around $20 per person.  Woo hoo!"

There was huge variety of dishes for for Veg and non-Veg. Everything was spiced perfectly and tasted fresh. Here what was on menu:\n-Idli (soft), Sambhar\n-Chutneys (Delicious)\n-Upama ( Best I have had so far)\n-Zucchini curry\n-Kadhi Pakoda ( oh so yumm!)\n-Yellow dal tadka\n-Cumin Rice\n-Navratan Korma ( good flavors)\n- Shahi Paneer (Okay)\n-Pakoris (Crispy)\n- Chiken tikka\n- shahi Chicken curry\n-Lamb curry\n-Chicken biryani\n-Sooji Halwa\n- Kheer\n \nThe server took a very long time to bring the water and clear the plates but food was delicious and we ended up having alot to eat.

Luckily I was meeting friends who had some knowledge about it and helped me out on what to have.  We went 'family style' so we were able to taste a little bit of everything we ordered.  \n\nFirst I want to say the service and staff here were amazing.  My water glass never went less than half full.  Kudos! Our waiter was very helpful also in helping us decide what to get.  I would say he went above and beyond! \n\nTo start off, we tried the Vegetable Samosa's and Vegetable Pakora's.  The Samosa's reminded me of an empanada except stuffed with potato and peas.  Accompanied with the sauces, these were great! The Pakora's were good also but a little too much breading.  For the main course, we went with the Chicken Tikka Masala.  The tomato curry sauce over the chicken was good! I scooped this over the basmati rice and was very pleased.   As for the chicken and rice dishes, there was plenty to be shared between 3 people and couldn't imagine eating this all myself. We even had much leftover! The garlic naan came out warm, flavorful and perfect.  \n\nOverall I was delighted for this to be my first Indian food experience."

I generally don't go to the buffet lunches as they usually don't offer the best selection (everything chicken) and quality but my friend said, the buffet is actually good and they even offer lamb curry/korma (you just have to ask for it and the waiter will bring it to  your table).\n\nThe flavors of all the curries were fantastic and deserving of 4-5 stars, the only problem is every curry was WAY TOO SALTY.  Not sure if this was intended being that it was a buffet and perhaps they want you to fill up on rice or nan.  Had they cut the salt in half, they would have gotten 5 stars from me.\n\nApparently they must be doing something right because out of the whole food court in Hawaiian Village, they were the only restaurant left standing.  I would potentially go back again but only if I needed some extra sodium in my diet."

The buffet was vegetarian heavy, which I loved as I favor the southern style. Waitstaff was friendly. The decor was pleasantly better than expected, considering this was not a strip hotel restaurant. I guess I would describe the food as not particularly gourmet, but utterly satisfying. Not bad for a semi-vacant strip mall. If I ever go back to Vegas, I will have to try dinner a a la carte."

Delicious, warm decor and excellent service. If you are having that sudden craving for desi food in the middle of the strip, look nowhere else."

The aroma of the place drew us in and got our taste buds working. We ordered chicken tikka masala, fish tandoori with naan and rice. It was all very delicious - full of all the flavors you'd expect in an Indian dish - tied together with thin and crispy naan. The service was great as well - the waiters were very accommodating to every request we made for our food and water was refilled in a timely manner.

The restaurant is located upstairs in a little strip mall or whatever  it is.  There is an escalator to get up there.  We sat down on a monday night - not busy, but i dont care.\n\nThe waiter took forever to take our order.  I ordered the Meat Thali.  The food was bland and not tasty.  It was better than Gandhi Indian restaurant for sure, but still sucked.  We came here specifically because another yelp review said that the naan melted in your mouth.  I call BS.  No way.  The prices were expensive 15-18 dollars a plate. \n\nThey gave us onions and indian pickle without asking which was nice.\n\nAnyway Bottom line is that I will keep looking for that elusive good indian restaurant in Las Vegas"

            "review": "Indian food for two?  Walking upstairs at the Hawaiian marketplace, you'll be surprised to see this dimly lit restaurant and its ample seating area.  They offer a buffet lunch and dinner a la carte.\n\nIt's hard when you want to try a bunch of different stuff when it's just you and the BF.  But Tamba offers a couple of 'feasts' to help satisfy that curiosity!\n\nFor $25, the BF got the Ashoka's Feast which comes with:\n\n* Tandoori Chicken \"Spring chicken in a mildly spiced ginger yogurt sauce.\" - It came with two drumsticks and two breasts, a decent amount to start his meal.  There were three dipping sauces - the mint one, a chutney of some sort, and a dark purplish one.  I'm not a particular big fan of tandoori, but the BF ate three pieces of it.\n\n* Lamb Curry \"Cubes of lamb cooked with onions, tomatoes, garlic, red chilies, and pickling spices.\" - It tasted a bit gamey for me, but we did enjoy dipping our nan bread into the sauce.\n\n* Chicken Tikka Masala \"Chunks of boneless chicken roasted in the clay oven and then served in a mild curry sauce.\" - The chicken was white meat, and pretty flavorless.  But the curry sauce was SO good!  I wish I had a bucket of that to dump all over my rice and to smother my nan bread with!  Next time I'll tell them to skip the chicken and give me more of that sauce!\n\n* Kali Dal \"Slow cooked black lentils with a medley of spices.\" The BF thought this would taste just fabulous in a burrito, as in skip the black beans, refried beans, or pinto, and add some black lentils instead.  Pretty tasty stuff and good with the nan bread too.\n\n* Rice - A generous scoop coupled with a few green peas for decoration.  Needed to enjoy all the lovely sauces the meal has to offer.\n\n* Nan \"White flour tandoori bread\" - A must when eating Indian food.  My preferred choice when soaking up any kind of curries, especially those that come with tikka masalas! \n\n* Raita - Condiment based on yogurt used as a sauce or dip.  Served chilled and has a cooling effect when eating spicy dishes.  I'm not a big fan of the raita and was only dumping it on the rice 'cuz the BF was doing it.  I can pass on this.  \n\n* Daily Dessert - Two small donut-like holes sitting in a bath of butter and honey.  Oh so sweet and a nice finish after a hearty Indian dinner.\n\nI ordered up the Buddha's Feast for $21 and this is what I got: \n\n* Vegetable Samosa \"Crisp golden brown pastries stuffed with mildly seasoned potatoes and peas.\" - The order came with two samosas, and two dipping sauces.  The BF was pretty impressed by these, and I'm lucky that I had two to share!\n\n* Malai Kofta \"Chunks of cheese tossed in a mild buttery cream sauce.\" - It came with one chunk of cheese only, which I couldn't even tell was cheese! I thought it was a mixture of chickpeas or something.  The sauce was okay, and good for dipping. \n\n* Saag Paneer \"Spinach with our special cottage cheese cooked in a karahi with house spices.\" - It came with one piece of cottage cheese, and I think it lacked flavor.  The BF said it had been sitting out too long and this is one of his favorite Indian dishes.\n\n* Kali Dal\n\n* Rice\n\n* Nan\n\n* Raita\n\n* Daily Dessert\n\nThe feasts are presented quite nicely on a large platter and it's a decent amount of food.  You definitely get the chance to taste a few different things without breaking the budget or ordering too much food.\n\nThe BF also ordered a Mango Lassi that he found a bit too sweet for his liking.  I thought it tasted fine, but was more watery than what I'm used to.\n\nService was good - our water glasses were filled without asking.  The only complaint was that our main courses came out too quickly after our appetizers.  We had to help the waiter move some dishes around while we were still eating and he was juggling the huge platters.\n\nThere's also a back room available for private parties with a more family style seating.\n\nSidenote: You can get a 50% off coupon/entree at the Tix4Less booth downstairs! Or a 10% coupon from their website.\n\n(Check out the pics of our eating in the business profile!)"

We noticed a major improvement in the ambiance of the restaurant. We were informed that the restaurant was renovated internally about 2 years ago. Tampa has made some very nice and noticeable changes to its interior. Tamba could use some improvements to the exterior as well. It is deep set in an aging shopping center which prevents Tamba from completely standing out and getting noticed.\nThe quality of the food and the service was excellent. Service included knowledgeable servers who wasted no time in informing us of the daily specials and the top selling dishes of the restaurant.\nWe had the Pani Puri for an appetizer and it was delightfully flavorful. For dinner we had the Butter Chicken and Tandoori Chicken. Both of these dishes were prepared to our taste buds' liking. The sauce on the Butter Chicken consisted of the right texture, color and flavor. The Chicken Tandoori lacked the artificial color (Thank You) which many Indian restaurants use to make it red however it tasted as chicken from a full flavored tandoor oven. It was tender and had the right combination of the herbs and spices.\nIt was a delightful change at Tamba from ten years ago and we will visit again."

By this time we were STARVING so I whip out my trusty iPhone and used my Yelp app to find this place just across the street. It's located in the Hawaiian Marketplace all the way in the back.\n\nThe first thing we did after we entered was pay the $15 for the weekend lunch buffet. I thought that was a bit strange but if the hotel buffet places can do it why not. \n\nThey had a lot of variety, at least 14 different items, and thought everything was just ok. One thing I thought was really good was their upma, it's like an Indian version of the Moroccan cous cous. It was my first time having the dish and it was simple yet very tasty. The chicken tandoori had good flavor but was a little dry. The chicken tikka masala sauce was good but there wasn't a lot of chicken, I had to dig around for some. What I noticed is that this place supplied small containers for the different dishes. I've never seen that before and thought it's a good idea for those who don't like mixing their food. \n\nThey were pretty good with refilling our water cups and clearing our dirty plates. Bad thing with this buffet was drinks weren't included so a separate bill was handed to us. Another downside was the food wasn't labeled properly, so I was just grabbing things blindly. \n\nOverall it was just an OK experience. At least Tamba introduced me to a new dish, now all I have to do is find it here in LA!"

Huge selection with plenty of veggie options. I don't  think there's a bigger Indian buffet in Vegas.\n2. Buffet is not set up against a wall so you can go down the row on both sides. No waiting!\n3. Great naan and great rice. These are key.\n4. All you can eat gulab jamin dessert. So good.\n5. Friendly staff. We've been going for years and the owners, staff etc have always been extremely cordial to us.\n6. 30 bucks for 2 adults and 2 kids. Hard to beat that.\n7. Great recipes of standard dishes that should satisfy most everyone.\n8. The place has Indian folks arriving in big numbers. There is no way an entire Indian family would go there and bring their non-English speaking, sari-adorned grandma, who happily eats with her hands, if this wasn't the real deal.\n9. Free parking. Pay 5 bucks next door at the lot and you get it back with your receipt when you leave. Sweet!"

I thought that was a bit harsh and strange as the dining area was a little more than half full already.  The kicker was a group of women that showed up about 15 minutes prior to closing and the same host was taking care and doting over them with open arms.  Guess you have to show some skin, cleavage, possibly more... to override the rules, eh?  \n\nService here on the whole part is excellent.  The food here is excellent and VERY fresh.  However, I highly do recommend not to order spicy as the last dish I ordered was heavily-overpowered with chili powder, but no taste.  Order medium, if you want a kick, but still can enjoy the flavors.  Portions are not big, but that is perfectly fine as they are definitely filling.  The garlic naan is good; samosas are forgettable and not worth it by any means; the korma is great; and I HIGHLY recommend the yellow/cumin rice as a side dish as it is superb. \n\nThe other knock-off is that they automatically added 18% gratuity to the bill.  It's one thing if it was a group of people and I understand that, but for just two people?  At least have a sign at the front desk or something on the menu that says this is going to be enforced.  It has nothing to do with us being cheap tippers or anything as we both vary between 15% to 20% on tipping (dependent on food/service etc...)  I know the last time I went with my boyfriend and a close friend of our's, this did not occur.  Was it because we \"inconvenienced\" them by coming in an hour before closing since the tone of the voice and body language of the host made it obvious?  Bizarre to say the least and this definitely did not go over well with the bf one bit.  The redemption was later on when I won money on the slots at Paris to cover up the dinner cost.   \n\nPricey, yes, but what do you expect in Vegas?  $14 for channa masala (garbanzo beans in a sauce) is hilarious as you can go get a Trader Joe's frozen version of the same thing/taste for around $2 and change.  Expect to pay at least nearly $30 a person to give you a gauge of what to expect.  \n\nUnfortunately, this last experience did not go over well at all, especially with my boyfriend.  We won't be coming back and we'll look for another Indian food restaurant avenue that will hopefully show more class to its customers when we visit Vegas again."

And there really was no service, so I can't even write anything about it. \n\nThe pakodas were downright pathetic, the navrattan korma was drowning in an unappetizing cream sauce, the naan came out of a freezer I'm sure, the saag was the worst I've ever had.\n\nThe dal was OK, but that's because it is almost impossible to screw up a dal. I did like the raita though.\n\nThe dessert was probably for diabetics. Honestly, if there wasn't a sign there that said it was kheer, I wouldn't have known. Seriously, it needed MUCH more sugar, some cardamom, saffron, nuts and needed to be made by someone who knows what kheer is.\n\nNow comes the funny part, they make you pay BEFORE you even sit down!!

However, last year i noticed that they had started serving tourist buses which hoard the place like bees to honeycomb. Last year I ignored it but this year when we visited the place again it turned out to be a big mistake. The server asked us to wait outside while they kept accepting 3-4 tour buses(about 100-150 ppl) one after other in front of us. In addition, they asked us to pay upfront for the buffet which is something I have never experienced at any decent restaurant.  We waited for 20 mins watching hoard of Indian tourists going in and out of the place. We asked the server if we can go in and check the spread of buffet but we couldnt even get a sneak peek of the spread because the place was full of overflowing tourists like washroom of a football stadium. We left place and returned the next day for lunch. It was the same story all over again. I am guessing the management only cares about making money and not providing any service.  \nI am sad this place was so good before.

In fact, the naan and Gulab jamun (dessert) were excellent, and  most of the other items, except Idlis and Sambhar were also okay (not great).

And Really, Zucchini as an entree in an Indian buffet !? :-o Also, I would expect more starters than just pakodas and  at least, a complimentary chai in a $20 buffet!

We never would have ventured into the Hawaiian Marketplace for food--never. After reading the reviews and finding a coupon in the Vegas 24/7 booklet, we went.\n\nIt was exactly as stated, totally deserted. We wondered whether it was open when we arrived at about 8:30. By the time we left, it filled to overflowing with mostly Indian clientele (which is telling). I think the dinner buffet began around 9 PM. \n\nMy husband and I are big fans of Indian, but we always find it hard to get really good and not just mediocre Indian cuisine. There's lots of mediocrity out there in terms of Indian. Tamba was really really tasty. We tried two new dishes which we enjoyed. \n\nThe first was Panipuri, an Indian street food, which involves a hollow shell made of Indian crispy bread which you fill with a green spicy sauce which is supplied separately. Thanks to our server who told us how to eat it. It's fun. Like a shot of mild spice. \n\nThe other dish we had was the dessert which came with the Ashoka's feast. It was made of dried carrot and nuts. Now, I have this weird thing against cooked carrots. They make me gag, but I love raw carrot. It's strange. So anyhow, I was not aware of what this dish, Gajar Halva, was made out of. I asked the waiter. It tasted nothing like carrot. It has this amazing texture and sweetness. I highly recommend it. Like most extra-American dishes, I find that you should eat it without knowing what it is. I think many Americans have preconceived notions of what things should taste like and their texture so knowing what you're eating is more apt to gross you out than allow you to experience it. \n\nOh yea, while the food was excellent here and the service, the Ashoka's feast is not really enough food for two people. We ordered the pani puri as an appetizer with this in mind and even though I wasn't starving, it was barely enough food. It was all very tasty, but I wish we had ordered a bit more food (especially now as I write this really wishing I was in Vegas eating some Tamba).\n\nI also did not find Tamba to be generic in any way, it was decorated nicely and was lit well, somewhat romantically, and quiet."

This was definitely a first for me. \n\nI was asked if I wanted my food mild or spicy, but my wife wasn't. When she got her meal (Yellow Dal) it was very spicy and not to her liking. She barely ate any of her food. She didn't return the food either because she was already so unsatisfied with the service she didn't feel the need to wait again. I'll give them credit for my Butter Chicken meal for being slightly above average and the spice (heat) level to be of my liking. \n\nDecor is nice, except for the random book shelf wall diving the kitchen from the dining. Atmosphere is above average.\n\nService was bad, to put it simply. Our actual waiter only came to the table when we got there, when we ordered, and when we got the check. Other waiters helped us in between. Also, our waiter waited over 15 minutes to bring us our check. He was wandering around and had clearly seen us just sitting there waiting.

We came during lunch and were able to eat off of the buffet and get unlimited non-alcoholic drinks for $13.\n\nBeing vegetarians, we were totally stoked that they had at least 5 different dishes in addition to rice, naan, and those weird soda break things.\n\nI learned that I love Dal Makni, Malai Paneer, and Punjabi Curry, which would be things I would normally not get to try because I always order my favorite, Muttar Paneer.\n\nAnyway, the service was really great, the location was awesome, and the food was so incredibly tasty. Five Stars alllll the way!!!"

Main issues that they have:\n\n1) Extremely arrogant staff that leads to Horrible service and also wrong dishes being served.\n2) Very poor quality of food. One out of 3 dishes we ordered had double salt in it!! When questioned about these, their answer is: Sometimes these things happen.\n\nLong story short, AVOID this place if you want to be treated well for the price you pay!!

Unlike the fancy hotel buffets which may look nice but lack substance, Tamba provides consistent Quality ingredients and delicious flavor. It is quite an extensive buffet with food that is fresh and perfectly seasoned. It is hard to find healthy, delicious cuisine at a reasonable price on the strip but if you appreciate indian food, I would head to this Beautiful restaurant before the secret gets out! We had dinner here once and lunch 4 times and already can't wait to go back! Our favorite dishes: malai kofta, dosa, samosas, garlic naan, kheer, gulab jamun. Great variety of north and south indian cuisine, done equally well. Definitely a must-do when in Vegas!"

The mixed tandoori grill and two mixed feasts represent a good mix of Indian dishes for those new to Indian food. \nTHE FOOD was excellent. I am no expert of Indian food, but everyone raved about it. My tamarind shrimp was definitely spicy, but not excessively so. The mixed tandoori grill was excellent for those who do not like spicy food.\nTHE PRESENTATION was good, especially for the mixed feasts and the grill. instead of just slopping the various dishes on the plate, each one is in a nice  stainless container.\nTHE SERVICE was excellent, even though we had a large party. We had several people who had never eaten Indian food and the waiter took the time to explain the various dishes, how to eat them and various nuances of Indian food. \nRECOMMEND"

I see that the right URL is provided, so let's make it easier for other people to find this Indian gem.\n\nSince this was my first time out as a Las Vegas resident, I was extremely pleased to discover that Las Vegas does indeed have stellar Indian cuisine. I read the first review carefully and already knew it was considered excellent by Indian natives.\n\nBut when I arrived and saw that virtually everyone in the restaurant was Indian, I knew it was going to be superb and it was. My perennial favorite, Lamb Vindaloo, was as spicy as it should be. The lamb was tender, although I've tasted superior lamb, namely in Paris.\n\nAs a starter I ordered Onion Kulcha. The waiter brought out the nan accompanied by a plate of tomatoes, onions, jalapenos and pickled vegetables. I knew then and there that I would be in for a treat.\n\nThe rice was excellent although I prefer mine laced with peas and authentic cardamom seeds, but for most food lovers this is probably adventurous enough. ;)\n\nIn all, a great find in Las Vegas. Don't let the Hawaiian Marketplace surroundings fool you, this is truly outstanding Indian food and Las Vegas deserves it."

The long buffet had a variety of great dishes, veggie and carnivore. It could have been sliced up more for my taste, but that's why we hit the chutneys.\nIt's a little pricey since I don't wallow away from the trough overstuffed and miserable but I'll be back.

Each time we have gone, we have found several items on the lunch buffet that we have never tasted before so we know that they change up the buffet items regularly.\n\nTheir tandoori chicken is the best I have had - it is always moist and tasty, not dried out or overcooked.  they always have a paneer dish there, a soup, lots of veggie dishes like aloo gobi, etc.  they always have a dessert on the buffet and loads of hot naan.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Indian food or is just learning - their buffet is a great way to jump in!"

While having our buffet lunch, I realized there were \"chicken pieces\" in \"Sambar\". I thought it was just my bowl of Sambar , NOPE all my four friends also found chicken pieces in their Sambar bowls. (Sambar is a South Indian dish made with lentils and vegetables)\n\nPlease see the pictures attached as proof. (go to photo gallery of this restaurant in yelp in case you do not see it along with my review post)\n\nI was SHOCKED and called the waiter to show our Sambar bowls with chicken, he neither was apologetic and said he would check and get back.\n\nAs I did not see the waiter come back for a while, I walked to the elderly person I believe he was the owner of the restaurant and explained him the issue with chicken pieces in Sambar. \n\nTo my utter dismay, instead of being apologetic he raised his voice and was acting shocked saying that he himself set up the Sambar dish in the buffet.\n\nBeing an Indian, with respect to elders (here the owner of the restaurant) I continued to be polite and informed him that it is a SERIOUS OFFENSE. One cannot serve a vegetarian dish with meat in it, if it does have meat they need to highlight in the description of the dish in buffet table.\n\nHe continued to raise his voice and was defending himself, whereas I was trying to be polite and making sure that this NEVER happens. I pity the vegetarian customers who ate their lunch with Sambar earlier in Tamba on same day.\n\nThis elderly person continued his arguments and in no ways was apologetic and instead was saying someone else would have done that. Whatever might be the reason one cannot serve meat in a pure vegetarian dish.\n\nWhile he continued to defend himself in a high pitch voice, the customers around that time stopped by and were shocked to know about Sambar having chicken pieces in it.\n\nFinally, the waiter intervened, took this hot headed elder person away and they removed the Sambar from the buffet menu.\n\nNeither the Owner nor the waiter offered a sincere apology for their GRAVE mistake.\n\n*** At the end, I would like to WARN all VEGETARIANS who visit Tamba restaurant to be careful when eating any dish they serve. ***\n\nI am glad my wife was not around with me for lunch buffet on that day, she is a vegetarian. It would have been a life time regret for her."

Two of us are Indian food junkies and knew we'd need a fix while there.\nGreat choice in picking Tamba!  We had made reservations for Thursday night at 7, but didn't need them b/c the place was dead when we got there.  It picked up as the night went on, but I think the location (hidden in a building behind the Hawaiian market) makes it a tough find.  We both ordered entrees instead of the buffet.  She ordered a chicken curry and I ordered the eggplant dish.  Both oh-so yum with excellent spice and seasoning.  We also got rice and naan to split, and a $30 bottle of wine.  Our total damage?  About $60.  Cheap for Vegas, huh?\nDecor was nicer than the usual Indian restaurant, dim lighting, and I liked the way the restrooms were decorated.  No loud Bollywood music videos playing here.  And it's always a good sign when most of the customers are Indian families!\nOur cheapest and BEST meal of the trip."

Having lived in India as foodies for 20 yrs i can say that this is undoubtedly the BEST high-end Indian restaurant in the city. The food isn't loaded with spice... and the ingredients are fresh and aromatic. Been here couple of times whenever I visited Las Vegas.  To begin, this is a fine dining experience & the ambiance is good.  Brilliant food, brilliant service and a wonderful atmosphere! The waiters were very friendly. The atmosphere is very calm, perfect for a dinner after sunset. The food is a perfect replica of authentic indian food, and the most real indian food you'll find in Las Vegas possibly in even The whole west coast. The menu is vast and full of variety. Can be a perfect setting for a romantic or group dining. For all veg/ Non-Veg eaters, I recommend you should try their signature dish because you will be blown away, trust me. What else can you ask for. Definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in town.  A special note to Mr. Rishi Kappor ( GM of Tamba ) \n\" It was a tremendous experience dining at your restaurant. Thank you so much for your outstanding professionalism and warm hospitality shown to us. The service and food quality was excellent, a credit to you all. Thank you for a most enjoyable evening.....God willing I will return some day soon, rest assured that your business cards will be passed along, so thanks again and a hearty CHEERS!! \""

Moreover, they also have few South Indian dishes in buffet. Usually in buffet you get served with fresh bread called'NAAN'. But they just put it in buffet and it was dry, hard and cold.\nOne more thing is that they might have contract with Thomas cook or some other travel agents so they bring their travellers during lunch time. So it's all crowded and mostly you have to rush to get the food and especially South Indian since most of them were South Indians!\nIt's bit pricy compare to the food and service!"

We have two boys (10 and 14) and all four of us were trying to plan how to go back when we could on our stay here. We had dinner one night (ordered off menu) and buffet two days later for lunch- both times it was awesome. Lunch is less expensive of course. We tried several new dishes in the buffet and we all loved everything.  We lamented our shows all started at 7pm and they didn't open until 6pm for dinner :( but we found a way to get there for lunch! The service was outstanding- a super classy place tucked away in an odd little location. Well worth searching it out! ;)"

I love every dish I've had with chicken in it. I don't usually like curry to much, but I love the curry dishes here. I usually get 7-10 on the spice level as well. There are also a lamb dish that is amazing, which is best spicy. I think most things are best spicy. \n\nThis is a great place to go on the strip for Indian food, and if you have a large group.

Yes the service is lacking with odd waiters who could use a few lessons in good manners but the food was always delicious. \n\nFor dinner, highly recommend ordering pani puri to start with. The puri was crispy and the pani perfectly made. Also don't miss out on the lamb chops! Weird to order at an Indian restaurant but honestly they were incredible. We kept ordering more and more plates because we just couldn't stop eating them! Oh course we tried all the stables, butter chicken, chicken biryani, paneer tikka, palak panner, garlic naan and raitha. Everything was delicious and nothing was left over. The dishes are kinda on the small side so it's good for sharing and trying a bunch of items. \n\nOk, so this lunch buffet is pretty extensive and basically has everything your hungover tired body needs--samosas, upma, uttapam, idli, sambar, kadhi, naan, fish curry, chicken like 5 different ways and everything in between.\n\nDefinitely give Tamba a try and be your own judge :)"

Hahaha what does that mean I don't get myself... anyways both items were really good... my boyfriend and I gobbled both of them up! Portions were pretty big compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to... also their bowls are pretty cool (they were shaped like a spoon? You have to see it, I can't really explain the weird shape right now) but need to be handled to great care as you can easily spill whatever item on your pants (like my boyfriend on his favorite khakis... RIP favorite khakis).\n\nWaiters here were pretty friendly, cool, and funny. What I liked was that they kept filling up my water!

We headed to this place before starting the ride back to San Diego.This restaurant is tucked on the second floor right behind the all the shopping cabanas.\n\nThere were a complete of options for veg and non veg appetizers and main course at the buffet during the lunch. Tried the Sambhar(Lentil Soup), Idli(Rice cakes), tandoori chicken for appetizers. For main tried the Chicken curry, Chole (chick peas) with naan and rice. The food was really nice and everything was fresh. Though desert was a disappointment."

Quality  of food  and quantity of food is  below average. Our Naans were  not evenly cooked properly.  It was a disappointment for the money we spent. They must improve or they will go under. \n\nNext day, we ate dinner Buffett  in Aria  on the strip across from Tamba.  They have Indian Tabdoori food in buffet menu and many others high quality items such as crab,  sea food, deserts, Asian,  American and Italian food.  For what we spent  in Tamba, we  got many times  the value and top service that of course one can expect from a five  star hotel.  I will like to patronize  Indian food but I will recommend to explore other choices that offer Indian food and Tandoor dishes such as served in Aria hotel and casino."

The image I gleaned from their website made it appear to be all plush pillows, flickering candles, and meditating statuettes. \nThe internet can be so deceiving. \nFirst of all, the chic dining area they prominently display on their website, which is (and I quote), \"designed as a hipster hangout and features plush seating beneath the striking murals of international artist Farhad Elahi\" is their reserved banquet dining room, tucked far away in the backend of the restaurant. Regular parties eat in a much less interesting and unromantic dining space, complete with standard tables and chairs. I suppose the general vim of this spot is acceptable for lunch or a casual dinner, but it was V-Day and I wanted to sit on a sexy red pillow damnit! Exacerbating the ambiance situation was the food situation. Being adventurous- not to mention gluttonous- we pretty much ordered one of everything. The mulagatani soup was an unremarkably flavorless bowl of pepper and water, while the other Pakistani style dishes were just as boring and lacking in flavor and heat. The service sucked, especially considering it was V-Day. This place is in sync with the line of reasoning adopted by its sister restaurants around the valley (Gandhi's and Gaylord's), in that hiking up your prices and offering a wine list somehow makes you less of a mediocre North Indian/Pakistani spot and more of a, and I quote, \"hipster hangout.\" Next please."

The core of the meal, the proteins, should also not be mystery meat bobbing in a thin gruel of oil and colored sauce. The most edible thing was probably the goat curry, and only because I love me some lamb/goat. There were little signs to help you navigate the curries (as we discovered later), but they misidentified stuff and were hard to read. The place looks nicer than it tastes, fo sho."
