            "review": "Let's start off by saying this place isn't the cheapest of places so be prepared to spend a little extra. However, the food and service are too good for me to pass up a 5 star (okay, if I could, I'd give a 4.5). My boyfriend and I came pretty hungry after our flight to Las Vegas and we're slightly disgruntled when we arrived to Tableau around 11 AM and heard we would have to wait about 30 minutes for a table. Luckily they said we could walk around and they could text our cell when a table became free. We walked around the hotel (which is very pretty!) and before we knew it, a table was ready. In fact, a lot of tables were open when we returned so we got to choose a nice table inside next to the window (it actually got pretty hot). Our server was very friendly and helped us choose what we wanted. \n\nWe ordered (and don't judge how much we got):\n-Tableau Burger ($24) - so-so, the meat was good but they caramelized the onions which my boyfriend wasn't a fan of. Any burger more than $15 makes me skeptical in general though. \n-Acai booster ($15) - really good but for the price, not worth. It comes in like a wine glass filled to the brim to give you an idea of how big it is. I did really like it though.\n-Duck Hash and Eggs ($23) - quite good. I was stuffed by this point so saved it and ate it later and it was still very good.\n-Steak tartare ($21) - my boyfriend really liked this but since I'm just meh about steak tartare, I'm not sure. It was good I suppose and a hefty plate size.\n-Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes ($24) - pass. The crab cake itself is good and apples with it arent that bad but mixed with the caramel sauce, didn't think it worked.\n\nAlso, the complimentary bread they serve is to die for, my favorites were the honey corn bread and pumpkin spice muffin SO good! The blue cheese bread is also a good savory option. I'm telling you, you have to try them all! \n\nOverall most of food, I would say, is worth the price and staff are extremely friendly and attentive. Great experience."

            "review": "It's only right that I finally give Tableau a review. Having spent several holidays in Vegas with my girl and her mum, Tableau was always included as one of the restaurants we would have on the must do list while there. After many breakfasts and a couple of lunches, I have concluded that this establishment deserves the five stars I have rated it. Not once have we ever been disappointed. While playing at Wynn, it was always my job to find somewhere to get the girls a great meal. And with the help of Yelp, we were led here to be treated to exquisite service and truly awesome dining. From the fabulous breakfasts, to the creative weekend brunches, every meal left us wanting more. Our last time here had us enjoying the brunch. Girl had a great French toast with fresh fruit and succulent sausage.  The French toast were thick slices of custardy delight, golden brown and topped with fresh seasonal mixed fruit, house made juicy sausage made the dish savory and delish. I enjoyed an eggs Benedict special made with beef tenderloin and blue crab. Omg, mouth watering and presented with perfection. It was to much to behold until I took my first bite. Juicy and cooked perfectly, over poached eggs, and a decadent hollandaise sauce. Again awesome. We enjoyed a couple of the mixed drink specials suggested to us and again were wowed. They completed our meals greatly to our delight. After lunch we sat with hot delicious cups of coffee to settle us before we returned to game. I can't say more to conclude this review except to suggest you try Tableau if your in Vegas and at the fabulous Wynn. Their menu will leave you lost for choice. Bon appetite ."

The food seems to be made to order and doesn't taste microwaved. They have so many fantastic choices that we would rather have a late big breakfast and skip lunch. The service is friendly and prompt. If you are not into Vegas buffet, this is the best place for breakfast hands down."

The conservatory is the next best thing to being outside.  Elegant dining with excellent, unpretentious service - what else do you expect from a Wynn establishment?\n\nFour choices of bread to start off, then I had the Duck Ravioli while the wife had the Blue Crab Sandwich.  Both were excellent.  She also had the Blue Crab Soup which was brought out with chunks of blue crab and separate container of the soup which was poured into the bowl at the table.  Soup was so good that you want to lick the bowl.  Of course you can't but use the bread to sop up the rest.\n\nNo room for dessert and they surprised us with a chocolate baked item before we left.  The waiter also brought me an iced tea to go.  What service!"

My friend got a meal there (their breakfast plate??) it came with a drink, a basket of assorted baked goods, toast, and eggs. My other friend got the benedict. All meals were enjoyed with hot tea. We all got our own pots of hot water and of course it came with milk and sugar.\n\nI'm sure this review has been extremely helpful to you. What you should take away from this, is that the service was nice, it is a great facility, and the food is good."

            "review": "We stay at the Wynn 6 - 10 times a year. It's like our second home.  Overall their service is amazing and food quality/options are excellent. \n\nHowever, we've been to Tableau several times over the past few months and it falls way short of what we expect from the Wynn. \n\nAtmosphere - Nice, bright, comfortable\n\nService - Our last two experiences were terrible. Servers had odd personalities, messed up our orders, didn't come back to check on us, etc. Similar experience twice in a row with two different servers. \n\nFood - Very hit or miss. There are a few items on the menu which are very good (Burger is one of them). However, other items are mediocre at best. I had the duck confit salad on my most recent visit and the duck tasted like it had been sitting out for 3 days, chewy and no flavor. The entire salad was bland and tasteless. Also, they have very few healthy items on the menu. We spend most of our time in Vegas over indulging so it's nice to have a healthy option when it comes time to detox. \n\nVery disappointed and hope they bring this place up to Wynn standards in the near future. Won't be back anytime soon..."

My wife, however, had the dungeness crab sandwich which was just unbelievable.\n\nI was dressed casually and didn't feel one bit out of place.

            "review": "Yet another disappointment from Wynn. Much like the hotel itself, we thought Tableau was completely over-rated. We came here for brunch after reading all the reviews and were expecting great things, but were disappointed. We were seated outside, overlooking the pool, so that was nice. However, it was 100+ outside and the misters at our table were the only ones on the entire patio that weren't working. We actually waited for a good 10 minutes before our server, Evan even asked us what we wanted to drink. When I asked about the misters, he gave me a smart remark. We brushed it off and placed our orders.\n\nI had the eggs benedict and the hubby had the kobe dish. The food came out in a timely fashion, but the food was sub-par for such a fancy restaurant. My english muffin was burnt and I couldn't cut through it with my knife. I ended up eating the ham and egg part separate from the muffin, which were pretty good. The kobe dish was just ok. Nothing special and certainly not worth the price tag.\n\nNow back to the service. We weren't even checked on during the time we were dining. Our server was standing behind us and didn't even ask us if we needed anything! When we were done eating, we had to ask a different server to flag down our server, Evan, for the check. Evan didn't even return with our check; the other server did. Definitely not a 5 star dining experience. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this over-priced mediocre place. If you want real brunch, head over to Bouchon at the Venetian. Oh, and weak mimosas and sour OJ! Thumbs down!"

Has 3 seating areas, once entered you pass the main dining room which is kinda dark and subdue to be sitting here in the morning, then comes the beautiful indoor enclosure with big french doors - you can sit here without sacrificing view, then comes the patio by the pool.\n\nBreakfast is served different than your usual - nicely presented and all but taste wise I had better. I had the egg benedict and it was a little sour and no it's not rotten. I know they must have overused the vinegar when poaching the eggs. So I didn't enjoy it that much. The only thing that blew me away was the crossiant. It's like Renaud in Santa Barbara. Each bite into are layers of crisp. Best croissant.\n\nService was good, no grumpy but all could have been better with just a little smile ."

The soup was a hit .. nice flavor and just the right amount of creaminess. The Benedict was the only thing that was not good. The slices of Salmon were too thick and the sauce was tasteless. \n\nThe reason for the three stars is the service, ,or shall I say the \"lack of service\" our waiter was very prompt in taking our drink order (which consisted of mostly coffees and teas) and it took about 20 minutes for the order to be delivered. Once we had the drinks, no one offered or came by with refills. Our water glasses were empty by the time we got our food and were never refilled either.  I was perplexed by this as the reviews I had read have raved about the service .. but when the check came it became very clear to me. Tableau automatically adds the Gratuity to large parties. So I am guessing that the server knew he'd get a certain amount regardless of what type of service he gave. This is not acceptable especially since the menu is a bit on the pricey side and the restaurant is categorized on the Wynn website as \"Fine Dining.\""

Decided to go here because I wanted to try the white chocolate orange french toast.  This was good but not awesome.  Maybe I had too high expectations after reading these reviews.  I guess I thought the white chocolate flavor was too subtle so it was more like orange french toast.  I also tried kind of a duck benedict.  Chopped duck braised with onions in a pastry.  Topped with scrambled eggs and tomato hollandaise on top.  So tasty!  Only slight complaint was that the hollandaise, although good, did not contain much tomato flavor.  Everything about this place is top notch which is what I would expect from a restaurant at the Wynn."

Well, for brunch that is.\n\nFrom the relaxing views of the well manicured gardens to the elegant dining atmosphere, no detail is overlooked at this posh \"English tea party\" inspired restaurant. \n\nThe brew here is eye opening and the OJ is freshly squeezed. Small details IMO that make the dining experience that much more enjoyable. In this day and age, we all know little things do mean a lot!\n\nIn regards to the brunch fare, I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and flavor. You can tell the execution was performed with distinction & care.\n\nAlthough the white chocolate French toast was the claim to fame here, I was hooked by the pictures of fluffy blueberry pancakes on my iPhone Yelp app. Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed at all. It was as fluffy and soft as I expected. I would have preferred more fresh blueberries, but with all things considered,  it was still quite a treat. Especially when I drizzled a generous amount of that warm maple syrup on top and watched it cascade down each thick layer of divine, doughy goodness!\n\nHowever, the highlight of the meal had to be the Duck Croque Madame. I'd even venture out to say that it's the single best thing I've ever had for brunch thus far in Vegas! Topped with a fried egg (now how can that be wrong?!) this French sandwich was packed with mouthwatering deliciousness!  From the perfectly tender morsels of duck that tasted like it was slow roasted for hours, to the melted Gruyere and caramelized onions (reminiscent of a french onion soup), it was like a virtual foodgasm in my mouth!\n\nSo there ya have it, pleasant atmosphere, beautiful views, and incredibly good food.  What more could you ask for? That's right, seconds!\n\nHappy Eats!"

I have heard that Steve Wynn was vegan for a period, and makes sure there is vegan options available in his restaurants.  I saw on their website that Wynn and Encore have teamed with vegan chef Tal Ronnen to offer unique and healthy alternatives any time of the day.  This made it an easy choice to come here.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Orecchiette with wild mushrooms, asparagus and fresh tomatoes!  My friend had the salmon burger with French fries and house made ketchup.  He raved about the ketchup, and so I tried it out with a French f.ry.  The ketchup was so good, I almost wished I had something to put the ketchup on!\n\nThe service was impeccable, the atmosphere was charming with cozy comfortable chairs.

We have sampled most of the restaurants within the Wynn/Encore resort and this one is certainly near the top of the list. Much better than Alex ever was...\n\nOnto the food:\n\nCoffee: Not bad, but nothing special either. My cup was always full and there was plenty of cream & sugar for my wife's coffee. Basically, they didn't screw-the-pooch on this one like so many Vegas establishments do.\n\nFrench toast:  perfect portion size, nice subtle orange flavor, crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Excellent and highly recommended.\n\nPoached eggs and elk sausage:  we have never had poached eggs actually shaped like eggs - very cool. The sausage is full of spices and isn't dominated by a 'gamey' elk flavor. \n\nBacon: I'm a snob when it comes to Vitamin P and Tableau didn't disappoint. Perfectly prepared and good flavor. Again, not the best I've ever had but definitely at a high level."

I went here yesterday with my family for Saturday morning brunch and we all loved it!\n\nIt's located in the Wynn, but considerably tucked away (adjacent to the Tower Suites - you have to walk through a coffee shop/lobby to get to it). The ambiance is very pleasant - there's an open view of the pool. We were seated at a cozy table right by the window.\n\nBetween us, we ordered the Hudson Valley foie gras as an appetizer (it was so sweet of Tableau to accommodate this request, considering it's technically on the lunch menu and we went during breakfast/brunch hours), Maine lobster salad (for me) and vegetarian omelets (for my mom and grandma). The foie gras was fantastic - it was served on a slice of cornbread with a delicious strawberry basil jam. The cornbread was an excellent compliment to the foie, and the jam was perfectly sweet. My salad was generously seasoned with chilled fresh lobster, and I was tickled by the fact they sliced boiled quail eggs into it. The citrusy dressing was light and fresh, as well. I can't comment on the omelets but my mom and grandma seemed to immensely enjoy them, along with the red sauce it was served with. I did sample one of their hash browns and it was great - I loved the fact they were molded into tiny little cake-like structures. Great presentation overall - something you wouldn't expect from breakfast. When we were nearing the end of our meal, we were approached with a basket of freshly baked bread options - popovers (with or without bacon), cornbread, and muffins. I chose the cornbread (it was just so good!) and my mom and grandma got the regular popovers. It was a very nice ending to a great meal. Service was great as well.\n\nIf you're in Las Vegas and looking for a great breakfast/brunch option, I highly recommend Tableau. It's a wonderful spot!\n\nP.S. If you're like me and like to scour Yelp reviews/photos before going to a restaurant, you should know that they unfortunately no longer serve the milk and cookie souffle I was dying to try. Still, they have other great options you shouldn't miss!"

When we arrived, we had to wait, so we decided to sit at the bar. The bartender didn't know anything about what drinks they offered or how much anything cost. He ended up saying he never works inside of the restaurant, but that doesn't excuse his lack of knowledge since he was clearly supposed to be the bartender. \n\nOur waitress was no better. She had a very uninviting demeanor to her and a slight attitude. I asked her for a cup of the French Press, and she snapped at me stating that they were out. From that point, the service just went straight downhill. \n\nLuckily, our food was delicious. I have a great appreciation for warm, fluffy pancakes, and the blueberry pancakes here were top notch!

(If you're not a vegan or vegetarian, or you don't have a food allergy, you probably don't understand how profound that is, so just take my word for it. It's amazing.) Thank you, Mr. Wynn, for making sure your establishments' restaurants have vegetarian options!\n\nI eventually settled on the vegan \"eggs\" benedict--in truth a scrambled tofu served on a circle of probably white toast (an approximation of an English muffin without any dairy products) topped with a really tasty yellow tomato \"hollandaise\" sauce. I typically don't like tomato, but it was good sauce :) I had gone with the benedict because as someone with an egg allergy, it's something I've never really had and may never have the opportunity to have again. I also had the side of marble potatoes, which was good, but a little more mundane than vegan \"eggs.\" Mr. Piano had a real eggs benedict, which I mostly recall for the fact that I was inexplicably happy about the fact that the presentation for the real eggs benedict looked really, really similar to the presentation on the vegan version. I still don't know why it tickles me, but it does. Maybe because the parallel presentation is cute. I can't recall what the others had, but there wasn't much of anything left by the end, so it was probably pretty good. The only food item we might have had any problem with was actually a beverage--the coffee came out in a French press (we'd gotten a small pot to split between the three of us who wanted some) and had decidedly not been allowed to steep long enough. The first pour was kind of weak, and knowing that the grounds would still be partially in contact with the liquid while the pot sat, I suggested that we wait a bit and then try again, which worked a bit better than I thought. (I am more of a tea than coffee connoisseur, if I can be called either, but I had enough information to make a guess and got lucky.)\n\nThe setting is quite lovely--you can see into the courtyard and I believe the pool from the windows, and the chairs look hand-painted with their designs. It's kind of like what I imagine a little girl's tea party with dolls looks like in her head or would look like if she re-envisioned it in adulthood :) It's cute! The servers were also really friendly and accommodating--when they brought out the little treats at the end, the server suddenly remembered that I had mentioned my egg allergy and brought me out a chocolate covered strawberry since I couldn't have the little pastry treat :)\n\nIt is, again, a bit pricey (like all things in Vegas), but I'd probably brunch at Tableau again in a heartbeat if I even return to Vegas and have the opportunity!"

The service was attentive but not interruptive. You must have a mimosa (or 2), made with fresh squeezed orange juice and decent champagne. I ordered the omlette, with egg whites. My friend ordered the white chocolate orange french toast. This was by far the best french toast I have ever tasted. Too bad I can't eat more than a bite. For how great the food & experience was I was expecting to pay more than $60 - definitely worth it."

Started off great with the breathtaking atmosphere, iced coffee, and the complimentary pastries which were delicious, and went downhill very quickly. \n\nI ordered the eggs Benedict, with turkey bacon instead of real bacon. My order was brought out incorrectly the 1st time; they brought me some vegan dish with fake eggs and meat. Gross. They brought it back and then brought out the dish I actually ordered, and they forgot the sauce on the side. Waited for that to be brought out. Then I went to bite into my eggs, which were wayyyyy undercooked. It was literally jiggling all over-it looked like it was alive. Even more gross. I order eggs Benedict all of the time and have never seen eggs come out this undercooked. I advised the waitress and she was very apologetic and wanted to bring me something else. She said that's how the chef prepares the eggs, and that they could cook them through more for me. At this point, I was overly hungry and frustrated, so I chose to cancel my order and pick off of my husband's plate instead. His meal was also unenjoyable: he had the hash, which was basically like eating pure salt. He didn't like it either. Total bummer.\n\nI would not visit here again for anything but a drink."

Too bad we were so full from all the food or else we would have gotten the souffle.  \n\nWill definitely come back for brunch here the next time I'm in town.

I like lighter tastes, hubby prefers a sweeter taste and both of us could not stop licking our forks. :)\n\nFood was excellent and worth the splurge. French toast was about $20 for 2 large slices.

Make reservations for faster service and request atrium seating - such pretty views and decor!\n\nThe next morning, we ordered the same 2 dishes but also added the elk sausage since it was so different than what we've had. It was smokier, muskier. Hubby loved it but I prefer the duck.\n\nThe apple pomegranate juice was very good too - a bit sweet but very fresh and smooth.

Alas, I realized that I was dining at the Wynn and I couldn't bear acting any way other than classy in any one of his properties--except for XS and Tryst, if you know what I mean.

Now, let me tell you that my mind was BLOWN away by the awesomeness factor and the meticulousness considered in favor of the customers' comfort.  My purse was safe from the dirt and E. coli on the floors!  Just wow. \n\n\nSecond visit:  I ordered the French toast.  C'mon.  I had to have it.  I had to try it.  I can't NOT try every single French toast I see on whatever menu I can get my grubby hands onto. \nAnyway, it was mediocre.  The presentation was great, but the bread was soggy and couldn't stand up against the custard. The upside was that the bread was a multi-grain oat bread, so I got a good dose of fiber.\nAgain, service was great and made up for the lackluster French toast.

When the meat is in its minced state, you can't tell which part of the cow the meat really came from.  \n\nIn the spirit of finding a new brunch service that could exceed or at the very least match tried-and-tested Bouchon, I came across Tableau.  It looks fancy, it's in the fancier, poshier part of the Wynn (if that's even possible!), it's hard enough to find so nobody would just chance upon it, and the glass rotunda in the middle is definitely where the better tables are.  The four of us were lucky enough to get one of them.  \n\nThe service was excellent, we never had to ask for the server to top up our coffee and there was never a time that we had to flag down our server.  \n\nThe food though, was a bit of a let down.  Maybe I should've tried the orange-infused French toast with honey butter or the eggs benny that a few other yelpers were raving about, instead of the burger, because the burger was, well, ordinary in every way possible.  The hub had an omelet that was too overpowered by onion and the side of bacon was just so so.  \n\nSo given the price, I would rather go back to Bouchon for their blueberry friands, sourdough bread, chocolate croissant and pommes frites. http://www.yelp.com/biz/bouchon-las-vegas#hrid:PjzTZX9Il0c4LV-ezt13hA"

Since this place sat in the Regal \"Wynn Casino\", I automatically had high expectations. I think its only fair..  Well, it wasn't your neighborhood Denny's, that's for sure.. Another Extravagant Restaurant clearly evident by the Fine furniture, detail in its structure and the Staffs pleasant and proper demeanor that ran it. \n\nWhat I devoured Next to the window just a few feet away from the pool:\n\nHouse-made Elk Sausage & Eggs: This caught my eye since \"Elk\" isn't the standard breakfast fare I'm used to.. I asked the server if it was \"gamey\" and she said not really and then sold me on it. Well, it came on a neat little plate and looked like a sausage patty.. It was gamey enough for me and kinda dry.. I didn't like it. The hollandaise was good and the potaotes as well (only thing, I could of counted how many nickel sized potato slices there were on the plate!). I told myself if i'm gonna go for something unusual like this, I might as well try it served at a place like this?! Still didn't like it..\n\nWhite Chocolate & Orange French Toast: This totally 360'd my outlook of this place, I mean from pretty bad to Wow!! Besides that it looked like a half order dish, This was so sO SO Breathtaking!!! Although, much different from the typical comforting traditional french toast.. In the gourmet world, this thing was Brilliant! I had to desperately hold in my inner thoughts racing of joy cause I didn't want to look like a fool!! If you like sophisticated sweet and extra succulent french toast then you don't have to think twice on this one.. \n\nSignature Tableau Potatoes: looked like chicken nuggets.. The crust just lightly breaded, potato just the right softness and seasoning.. Worthy of its name! Dipped in their \"house-made ketchup\".. Potato lovers, enjoy!\n\nHouse-made Chicken-Apple Sausages: Juicy, Tasty and just hints of flavors unleashed through every bite! This with their ketchup and Potatoes = little meal itself!\n\nExpected Much and Got Most of what I expected especially from the french toast, just not the Elk.. Service was Top of its Class! Value: Most gourmet spots never seem to be worth the quadruple price tag but I think its understandable for the Occasional experience and those of you who have curious taste buds, that make it worth while (But you Might not want to dine at places like this, when you're super hungry.. Like how I was!). A Staggering $70 including 20+% tip (and just regular water to drink) for my solo breakfast getaway.. I have No Regrets! However, I think all thats needed is an order of French Toast (maybe 2 for me) and your Good to Go!"

We had clam chowder, which was OK; the bits of celery were unconventional, and quite frankly, not that good.

The free bread was incredible.\n- MUST-HAVES: French toast, Milk & cookies souffl\u00e9.\n\nOVERALL CONS:\n- A little overpriced. Actually let me rephrase. Very overpriced. But.. it was worth going one time to experience the great food.\n\nHere's what we got:\n\n* Free bread - OMG so delicious! Fresh out of the oven, and they come in these little baking pans. Incredibly soft & just breaks apart so easily so you can slather it with butter. A slight hint of sweetness to it too.. yum.\n\n* Fresh squeezed apple & pomegranate juice - Tasted very good, very fresh, like a great cider. I couldn't taste much of the pomegranate (maybe that was the slight tartness) but that's probably a good thing as too much pomegranate could easily be overkill.\n\n* Organic Pear Mixed Salad (pears, blue cheese, walnuts, mixed greens) - Good balance of ingredients, the blue cheese was nice and strong. The dressing was light and tart and there was exactly enough for the salad. But there were just a few pieces of pears (and they looked canned) and overall this just didn't wow me.\n\n* Eggs Benedict (poached eggs, nueske canadian bacon, b\u00e9arnaise sauce) - Perfectly cooked eggs w/ drippy yolk, great sauce. The english muffin was perfection, with that slight crunch, yet soft & warm. The bacon was a little tough to cut through though (and messed me up as I was trying to cut through the thing - I got egg yolk everywhere). Overall good, but unfortunately not worth $21.\n\n* White Chocolate & Orange French Toast (organic orange blossom honey butter, pure maple syrup) - This was absolutely amazing! There was that slight orange flavor (though I didn't personally catch any of the white chocolate), perfect crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Love the fruits you get on the side too - raspberries, blackberries, oranges, strawberries, blueberries. Just the perfect amount til the very last bite.\n\n* Milk and Cookies Souffl\u00e9 (chocolate chip cookie souffl\u00e9 served with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce) - THIS MUST BE THE BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER HAD. Warning: it takes a while to come out, but that's because they bake it when you order and you get it FRESH out of the oven. Our waiter poked a hole in the souffle and poured in the melted dark chocolate (don't worry, there was some left over). I took a bite and was just in Heaven. It is was incredibly soft and moist and gooey. I can't believe I ate the whole thing but I did! The ice cream provided a good temperature contrast, but it was kind of low quality ice cream, not very rich or creamy."

            "review": "In a nutshell:  go!  But take out a second mortgage first!  :-)\n\nWe had the chef's tasting menu.  If you think hoity toity restaurants don't give you enough food, you're gonna love Tableau.  Though I'm not a huge eater, I have earned enough remarks on how such a skinny guy can eat so much.  By the time we're done with all seven courses, I was completely ready to throw in the napkin, if not actually throw up in it.  Everything was very good and there were only one or two rough spots, though it won't be much of a stretch to forgive Tableau for those.\n\nThe amuse bouche was a mouthful of white bean and bacon soup.  Too bad it was an amuse bouche 'cause we've loved some more!  The first course was a \"club sandwich\" of smoked salmon w/ dill cream, paired with a tiny cup of white onion soup topped w/ a dollop of creme fraiche, both with a touch of caviar.  Mmmm... good!\n\nThen it was grilled foie gras on a maple walnut beignet.  Here's one of the rough spot, if you can call it that:  they could have cut back a bit on the foie gras.  It was a pretty big piece.  Following that is another small rough spot:  seared scallops w/ frog leg risotto.  The scallop was *EVER* so slightly overdone.  Not enough to be chewy, but it definitely should have been more tender.  The frog leg risotto was the dish's saving grace, creamy, fluffy, beautifully seasoned.\n\nThen it was the \"surf and turf\" portion of the menu:  black pepper crusted (yeah, I know, a bit cliche'ed) ahi tune steak on navy beans a broccoli rabe.  The tuna would seem a tad too salty, but was perfect when paired with the beans and the rabe.  The \"turf\" was a filet migon, again a tad on the \"healthy\" side size-wise, with sauteed pearl onions, atop two cute little oxtail stuffed canelloni.  Extremely clever!\n\nBy now, my wife was on the verge of passing out from all the food.  And she didn't even finish her tuna or her steak, leaving half of each.  And she's not a light eater, neither!  I was almost done as well, secretly hoping that the closing two courses would be either mercifully small or not so great, or both, so I wouldn't have to eat 'em all!\n\nNo such luck:  the \"fruit & cheese\" course was a pear walnut tart, with a piece of a fairly smelly but oh-so-delish cheese.  The dessert course:  my word!  It was: Frangelico creme brulet, Godiva peanut butter chocolate mousse, and maple syrup icecream.  I have *NO* sweet tooth at all, yet I finished everything, that's how good the dessert was.\n\nThe fun touches were:  Tableau is accessible only through the \"lobby\" entrance to Wynn's suites: we were greeted with supremely appropriate doses of deference, respect, and helpfulness;  tiny low stool/footrest that the wait staff would position next to each woman, so she has a place for her purse;  a \"foodie\" wait staff:  out waiter had eaten at the fabled \"The French Laundry\"!"

I am certain the other meals there are just as good, however I only ate breakfast here so that's all I can share. Note that if you book the \"Tower Suite Experience\" for a stay at the Wynn, you will receive a complimentary breakfast here. The menu items include things like apple pancakes and yogurt parfaits, acai bowls, and chorizo omelettes. \n\nMy kids had a yogurt parfait and plain pancakes. Plain pancakes were not on the menu, but they made them for us. They looks fantastic. With them came fresh whipped butter and syrup - no butter out of a plastic container. My husband and I had a veggie frittata which was healthy and fresh, and included veggies and feta cheese, with Parmesan and greens. We had some toast with it, and the toast came with fresh whipped butter and jams that did not look like they came out of a jar or a plastic package either. Yummy!\n\nThey also have fresh juices and cappuccinos, lattes, etc.\n\nThe ambiance here is very nice, classy and elegant, but not so much that you feel like you have to be dressed up -- it is right next to the pool (I'm sure you have to wear clothes though!). \n\nI would go here over some of the other options in Vegas, especially if you prefer good food with some class."

The atrium was full with about 5 other couples, but the rest of the place was empty. Quiet & cozy. A good break from the bustle of Vegas. Some Merlot, a bottle of Pellegrino, a pina colado (not for me, surprisingly). We were hungry and the wait was average, so as we waited, we noticed the small plates for bread. Thought it was odd that there were no pre-meal dishes. But no one else had bread so maybe it was just for brunch. \n\nI decided to indulge in a little red meat while I was out of town & had the filet of beef, which was a small filet mignon with mushrooms, spinach, crisped onions, stacked on a marinated bread. Wonderful and intricate. A perfect portion, unlike some Vegas meals which stuff you past walking capability. My guy had a lobster salad which he relayed was divine. Veggie stir-fry & quinoa as sides.\n\nAt this point, the table next to us asked for some bread for their party. The server came out with rolls in individual baking dishes... for the entire room... except our table. The table to my right was waiting for their dessert, and got bread. The table behind me was enjoying their entrees, and got bread. The table past the table to our left (which asked for the bread) had just been seated, and got bread. WTF!\n\nWe ordered and ate our Mini Pie Trio, paid our $150 lunch bill, and left feeling slighted."

I usually stay at Encore and come to Tableau every time I'm back in Vegas.\nThere's indoor and outdoor seatings where you can overlook the pool. \n\nFood is really good. \nI'm all about their homemade ketchup lol I've had almost everything on the menu starting with the Spanish omelette to french toast. Their avocado appetizer is great but you need to order a side of chips to go with it. Tableau hash is yummy and I enjoy it more than the main which was eggs benedict. \n\nThis time I ordered a chicken sandwich, poached shrimp salad, truffle fries and some avocado and chips. Right when I grabbed my sandwich, I found some lint on my fried chicken so I took it off. I was going to just eat it then I found more lint on the other side of chicken as it my chicken rolled on a towel or sweater. I had to ask the waitress to take it back. Lost my appetite so I did not order another dish. \n\nWaitress told me it must have been from towels and that they always sanitize the kitchen all day. Well... Still, there shouldn't be lint on my chicken sandwich. If there's lint lying around the kitchen because you sanitize too much, it means it is not sanitary. \n\nI'm pretty disappointed about ruining my brunch because I liked this place. \nWould I return?

Just delicious and priced fairly at $17. The potatoes were very unique --- gooey and crispy at the same time, never had anything quite like these. \n\nLunch\nTomato bisque was AMAZING. Wonderful portion size, served with the soft fluffy bread on the side in the mini tin pot. The bisque really surprised me. And the crab cake sandwich with fries --- most places cheap out on the crab, load up on the fries. The exact opposite here. Excellent high grade crab, well made sandwich, and the fries were just enough. The flavor of the fries was excellent (love the spice they put on top of the fries). Again, very fairly priced for what I got.\n\nService was fast and friendly.

Tableau doesn't often get talked about past breakfast which is why I was intrigued to dine here for dinner. Upon arrival I was seated in there main dining room which is a very small and intimate dining room. The windows were wide open and the nice nightly breeze was coming in. Once seated the bread came. This was much different from the ordinary bread basket. It featured a nice dinner roll in a small little pot. Its your ordinary dinner roll but reminded much of the ones we use to have at dinner growing up!\n\nI went with the tasting menu but had to stop half way because just like Le Cirque the portions are way to big which would be the only downfall in this restaurant even though some may like the large portions I'm a little guy and can only hold so much before I have to throw in the flag. The amuse was fried Cod, much like Bouchon Bistros Beignets de Brandade de Morue, over a bed of balsamic seasoned spinach. I found it to be much better than Bouchons version. It was full of Cod which was the ingredient that stood out the most because had a nice light texture that I found to be a nice little starter and the balsamic added a nice rich dark complex of sweetness to it!\n\nThe first dish was the dish everyone was talking about. The Dungeness Crab Ravioli which featured a lemon emulsion flavor. WOW this dish was FULL of fresh and perfectly cooked Crab with a Delicious burst of lemon flavor. I loved the dish and I can see why everyone talks about it. \n\nNext up was the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with glazed black mission figs, upland cress salad and red currant gastric. Now the foie gras was on top of a piece of toast that at first I found to be unnecessary but I put a little foie gras and fig on top just to try it out and It was perfect! I love figs and these were sublime. It doesn't get any better than Hudson Valley foie gras either! The red currant added a nice sweet jelly type taste to the figs. Overall a great dish with flavors that paired very well with each other.\n\nNext was the Grilled Free Range Duck Breast with sweet potato-pecan hash, stewed stone fruits, and wild flower honey just. This was my first time having duck. It was cooked medium and had a good texture without being to gamy. I LOVE sweet potato's and found the hash to be absolutely delish! The stone fruits and honey just added just amount of sweetness to the duck and the flavors all popped out and you could taste each and everyone of them in every bite! But as you can tell this is no tasting menu sized portion which left me to stop here. The portions are large for a tasting menu.\n\nOf course I couldn't leave without desert. I was presented with a desert trio. A blueberry shortbread sandwich that was to die for. So light and creamy!! My mouth melts when I think about it. A strawberry milkshake. Tasted like one of my protein shakes I drink which I do not like. Last but not least peach cobbler that was slightly warm with the ice cream slowly melting on top and tasted FABULOUS!\n\nOverall this was a great meal. I was seated next to a group of rich older foodies that I overheard talking how this is one of there favorite restaurants! I would agree. If they made there tasting menu portions much smaller I think this place could get a Michelin Star in the future because the Chef is very talented and the service was top class! They give the ladies a little stool for there purse which I'm sure all the ladies out there would appreciate. The tasting menu features some of the best ingredients and is a bargain compared to some other places at the Wynn. This is a place I would return to in a heartbeat!"

After he ordered the vegetarian eggs Benedict, our waitress mentioned that the English muffin had eggs in it and asked if he'd like to substitute something else for it. I know it's typical for restaurants to ask that, but I think most would forget those little things. I was very impressed at how accommodating they were.\n\nFOOD: The duck hash was amazing! The pastry layer on the bottom was so yummy and everything just complemented so well. The roasted tomato hollandaise made everything so delicious, and there was actually a lot of duck. It was also the perfect portion for me. I am definitely coming back for it.\n\nI also tried my boyfriend's vegetarian eggs Benedict and was impressed as well! The veggie patty was really good, along with the scrambled tofu and hollandaise.\n\nThe portions are on the smaller side, so you might want to order sides. Regardless, the duck hash is a MUST TRY!"

It is a place where you would like to go with your friend's for a nice brunch and sit and chat. \n\nThe food is great and the portions aren't as chihuahua size as other French restaurants. \nPeople may complain that it may be too pricey for breakfast or lunch, but compare to the other restaurants at the Wynn it is quite reasonable and fair. \nThe inside decor is quite clean and simple. I like it during the day because it is not too flashy and has a wonderful view.\n\nIt is a great place to dine for brunch with the gals."

That being said, this place is excellent.\n\nTableu breakfast.. $25pp, comes with coffee, your choice of juice (they have exotic juices like watermelon and carrot if you're into that), toast, eggs, bacon, and a basket of mini pastries.\n\nBasket of pastries was good, but cold.. I'm kind of into warm bread, so this was a disappointment. They had some cool things like white chocolate and orange muffin, but none were nearly as good as the pastries at Bouchon. This is where they lose the star.\n\nAtmosphere is fab, and service was quick... almost too quick! We were in and out of there in  under 30 minutes. I guess that's a good thing if you have a conference to catch or something?"

            "review": "\"Proper\" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Tableau. It doesn't hold a negative connotation, but the space definitely is reminiscent of an English tea party. Servers were prompt and attentive and very, very proper, and the setup of the sunlit room was classy and elegant. \n\nTrio of fresh juices: Red Deliciousness, Purify, Orange Zest:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zdiMak6UuWRV5AlvsB8_7A&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nI was unfortunately allergic to one or more of the fruit mixes in these juices, but the other members of my party verified that these juices were definitely freshly-pressed. They also mentioned that these are healthy and do taste it, so if that's not your cup of tea, maybe go for.. actual tea.. \n\nCream of cauliflower soup:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FdKXwBSOKe2aBqpIBQvKKQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nPer proper preparation, this soup was served via pouring at the table. It was thick, gloopy, and luke. warm. I had one sip and was so disappointed in the lukewarm temperature that it immediately became a miss in my book. I did appreciate the bits of toasted cauliflower and creaminess of the soup, but any soup that is lukewarm is a lost cause for me.\n\nChicken noodle soup:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nC5Jo6HDz4I6RpLxP2jkrw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nThe temperature of this soup was slightly warmer than that of the cream of cauliflower, but it was still far from hot. The noodles were slightly overboiled, and the broth was too salty for my taste. \n\nDuck hash and eggs:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=StJ8amQAT9SBTS11CtBhMQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nThe puff pastry on the bottom was rolled beautifully; it was flaky and melt-in-your-mouth despite being a little oily (as puff pastries can be expected to be). The duck hash was seasoned well, although I didn't get too much of a duck taste, and the egg balanced out the slight saltiness of the hash. I also enjoyed the roasted fingerling potatoes, as they added a cozy mealiness to the dish. \n\nWhite chocolate orange french toast:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mbPZyByuEpY0N7WRm4v9RA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nI love french toast, and I always itch to try it whenever I see it on any menu. After reading the rave reviews about the white chocolate orange french toast here, I was practically salivating even ordering it. When it was served, the presentation was beautiful and I was expecting it to taste as wonderful as it looked.. but it fell really short of expectation. The two pieces of bread were incredibly dry, and despite the beautiful browning of egg on each side, there was no egginess. I did get the orange flavor, but none of the white chocolate (and I prefer white chocolate to orange). Even plentiful syrup could not offset the dryness of the toast, and this dish was a crestfallen disappointment to me. It's possible it was just a fluke, but then it'd be a huge fluke.\n\nFilet Oscar benedict with beef tenderloin, poached eggs, blue crab, and housemade sourdough muffin:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=b4ZzfgTgNOQOMfyKJ9zabQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nI thought the pairing of beef tenderloin and blue crab was interesting, and it worked to a degree. The blue crab meat was slightly cold, as if it had just come out of the refrigerator, but the beef tenderloin was cooked a nice medium rare. The poached eggs had model runny centers, although the hollandaise sauce was a bit too watery for me. There was a lot going on with this one dish, and it's definitely something to dig into when ravenous rather than as an ending entree. \n\nI have mixed feelings about Tableau, but I'd be open to coming back for a second brunch visit."

The bright light decor aims to wake you up after a night of winning/losing, dining/drinking, and whatever other behaviors Las Vegas inspires.  The staff at Tableau are attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nFor lunch, I had the baby kale and romaine caesar with grilled shrimp.  What a great lunch!  The greens were fresh and crisp.  The dressing was tangy and savory but not over-powering.  The shrimp were enormous and probably more aptly described a prawns (though tasted like shrimp!).  The lunch rolls were freshly baked and delicious.\n\nOverall, Tableau is a phenomenal lunch spot.  I'd go again in a heartbeat!"

I appreciate their decision to serve Intelligentsia brews, but to offer only a dark roast and decaf option is baffling. I prefer a light roast, medium if I have to - dark roasted coffee mutes the flavor of the beans and adds a bitterness that some find bracing but I find off putting. I still appreciated the brew, but it seemed a shame that I had to add sugar to a ten dollar cup of coffee, even if it was complimentary. I ordered the breakfast sandwich on a whim, but it fell short of my expectations as well. The bacon and tomato jam were top notch, but the brioche roll and fried eggs seemed ill conceived. For one, I prefer the bread for a sandwich like that to be crispy. Then, the fried eggs, delicately and carefully cooked in butter leaving a pristine white with nary a fleck of brown, were completely wrong for this sandwich. The perfectly runny egg yolk dripped onto my fingers and all over the plate, and turned the roll to a soggy mess. There are many fine opportunities to break out showy culinary school techniques, but a breakfast sandwich is not one of them."

I just needed something lighter that night.  This dish is far from what I expected.  It was wonderfully juicy and tender with an almost sweet sauce that just brought the dish together.  \n\nOur waiter was friendly and chatty.  I know nothing about wines, but  we were celebrating our anniversary, so I decided to have a glass.  I described to him what I like and he brought me a glass of liquid heaven.  WOW.  I enjoyed it so much, I asked him to write down the name for me.   He even brought me the bottle to show me what it looked like so I could find it in the store.  Very nice.\n\nIt's a beautiful restaurant with partial views of the elaborate pool area.  Looks almost like the living room of a chateau transformed into a restaurant.  The decor is very unique, but it's a bit stuffy - like you're afraid to laugh too loudly when you're there.  Or if you drop your fork, you almost want to apologize for the noise.

At the time, this was one of the most elegant properties on the strip (and to this day, still is). I certainly felt somewhat out of place, but the service and company was exceptional, and didn't make me feel like the serf* that I normally am. \n\nA stunning dining room greets you as you walk in; the lighting was dim but not so much where you can't see the menu, the decor appeared to be in warm creams, with lively bursts of color on the seating throughout. We had a table inside, but the outside had a lovely view overlooking the pool. \n\nThis was my first time trying beef carpaccio; as this was one of those 'try anything' dining excursions I'll probably never have again, and I don't think I'll find a similar dish in quality anywhere else. Forgive me for forgetting the remainder of what I had that night, but this appetizer still stands out today. \n\nI wondered what those adorable miniature 'chairs' were next to our own, and while the male host said it was a place where one could rest their legs after a long meal, the other host-a female-explained to me it's where a lady puts her purse. My clutch looked minute settled onto this, but it served its job well.\n\nBased on the little I recall from dinner so long ago, I imagine Tableau really knows how to do an amazing brunch. Even with all the newer, high-caliber, celebrity-endorsed establishments that have popped up on the strip, I plan on making this a stop when I come back to town.\n\n*I most likely returned to this state once I exited the doors of The Wynn."

Smothered in their perfectly sweetened blackberry sauce - sweet and savoury all in one bite. Crunchy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. I polished all 4 in no time. The duck was beautifully cooked but the sauce just wasn't for me (too salty - tasted a bit like straight soy sauce). \n\nBoth pancakes were tasty but neither was something I would ever crave. Acai booster was a lighter choice I went with on my second day - reminded me of Jamba Juice (how do ppl feel full from this?). Smoothie like with a handful of berries and sprinkles of granola plus honey - refreshing and delicious. \n\nBread basket - part of Tableau signature breakfast - house made Danish, muffin, croissant, and donut holes. Paired with house made jam, marmalade, and butter - thankfully refills weren't complimentary or I would have devoured another basket myself... or maybe two more. \n\nService - depending on who you get - we felt totally pampered and catered to to completely ignored and annoyed. \n\nOverall - if it wasn't for the complimentary offer, doubt we would had visited it especially for the price point. But if you are looking to treat yourself and have a relaxing meal - make sure to ask for Vanessa to serve you!"

We made a reservation for Sunday brunch, and although they sat us a few minutes past our reservation time, they were very apologetic for it.  While we were sitting in the waiting room, the hostess came up at the exact time of our reservation and politely told us they were clearing a table and we should be seated within five minutes.  MENU MUST ORDERS:  Sour cream banana pancakes, duck hash, and greek yogurt with granola!  The sour cream banana pancakes are mouthwatering, the duck hash was incredibly savory, and the sweet honey in the yogurt was a perfect starting appetizer.  I used to compare this restaurant to Bouchon, but I think I have grown to like Tableau more.  You cannot beat the outdoor atmosphere.  Our waiter was attentive throughout the entire meal, checking on us frequently, but never too often.  Even the bus boy was friendly and pleasant.  It was my friend's birthday and they acknowledged the special occasion at the end of our meal with chocolate strawberries!  Great job, Tableau!  Keep up the good work!"

My husband's food was brought specially by someone who reviewed his allergies to ensure he would receive the right meal.  Skip the gluten-free pancakes, they're pretty dry even with butter. The garden frittata is fluffy, loaded with veggies, and has good caramelization on the outside while maintaining a moist center. It's also huge, so you won't need a side.  But if you're looking for one, share some breakfast potatoes with a friend, they're lovely."

We went there for brunch and sat on the patio which overlooked a highly manicured garden and small pool (built in entertainment included 50 something fat mob type with very young and very large fake boobed girlfriend who was obviously practically having sex with him in the pool at 11:30 in the morning because they connect spiritually).  What do you expect?  Anyways, beside that- this place was pretty good.\n\nThe service was very professional and competent, albeit a tad snooty.  I started with a bib salad on a bed of prosciutto garnished with pistachio encrusted spears of asparagus.\n\nThen, being hungover and ravenous, could not resist the Kobe burger.  YUM.  Cooked medium rare, juicy, tender and flavorful.  It came with fries but I subbed for the chick pea onion rings.  SUPER crispy!  The ultimate indulgence.\n\nSince my main man has been on an eggs benedict quest of sorts for a couple of years now- when he saw braised Kobe short rib eggs benedict on the menu, he almost had an aneurysm.   Needless to say, he found these quite satisfactory."

            "review": "Road Trip\nSummer 2016\n\nIt's a gamble to take a toddler to an upscale restaurant. My daughter is usually well-behaved when we eat out, however, there's a 99.9999 % chance she'll be a maniac. One little thing could set her off and her ear-shattering screams will pierce the air. Then all this chaos will attract a great deal of unwanted attention. Most people will be thinking I'm the worst mother ever, and they'll hate me for bringing a child in a classy place. I'll try to keep cool to let my kid know she can't always get what she wants, but she'll show no signs of stopping. I have never let my kid use my iPad or phone to avoid negative behaviors, but it will be tempting to give in. \n\nUgh. The struggle is real.\n\nI took a chance even though the whole experience was nerve-wracking. Our server took a while to get our order, she had a customer who was chatting up a storm. I know it's not her fault for the long wait, but I was nervous my daughter was going to break something or start getting fussy since I had to take some utensils away. Why do they have so many stuff on the freakin' table?!?! Fortunately, the little ramekins kept her busy. I was bummed I didn't get a stool for my purse/diaper bag like the others did, that would've probably kept her busy, too. Oh well, maybe purses from Target don't get a stool. Our friendly server was very apologetic about the wait, though, and we didn't wait long for the food.\n\nAt home, we often eat fruit for our first breakfast so I ordered a bowl of mixed berries. There was a variety of fresh blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. My daughter ate most of it, even the blackberries, which she never liked before. Since my little girl doesn't eat much, I just ordered the Pressed Duck and Waffles for us to share. That was the most interesting thing on their brunch menu, I've never had that before! I thought the duck was a little small but it was actually enough, my daughter didn't even want to try it. I love how the duck was perfectly tender and the sauce was tasty. The waffles were delicious, especially when I drowned it in the blackberry syrup. I also had the Orange Creamsicle Smoothie. I liked it but it had a little bitter taste, maybe that's why my toddler didn't want to have anymore after she tried it. More for me! \n\nI also got a $9 bottle of Pellegrino, I had to do something crazy, I was in Vegas after all. I had to live it up! Then I remembered I don't even like sparkling water. My daughter does, but there was no way she was going to finish a whole liter! I wanted to take it back to our hotel, but they didn't have the cap. Our server offered to give me a bunch of plastic cups to pour the rest, but I didn't want to carry fifty cups without a fully closed cover. Oh well. It was really nice of our server to help me out, though. The long wait in the beginning was all forgiven. \n\nAnd I was so relieved my daughter didn't have a hysterical meltdown!\n\nWhew! \n\nTotal: $58.75"

We all ordered something different so that we can have a taste of each dish. I ordered the purity juice, this was the perfect way to start my day off. I personally like it cold when I drink juice, so I asked for a side of ice. Just makes the raw juice taste so much better when it's cold. I went for the soft shell crab sandwich, this is a must try! It is very tasty and the crab is nice and crunchy. The batter was well made because when I took a bite into the sandwich, you can hear that crunch as you bite into it. Totally recommend this dish if you ever stop by Tableu. \n\nI also really like how the condiments are all made out of scratch, I mean,,,how many restaurant does this nowadays?

Instead, we encountered the worst service of my entire life.  \n\nI'm not complaining about the food at all.  In fact, the food was delicious.  We ordered the tomato bisque, the eggs benedict, dungeness crab club sandwich, yellowfin tuna tartare, huckleberry buttermilk pancakes, and scrambled eggs w duck puff pastry. Their cocktails were super yummy, too.  \n\nBut is a restaurant really great only for their food?  Are we paying only for the meal?  NO.  We're paying for great service, too.  I cannot believe how bad the service was, and how it progressively got worse throughout our meal.  The first thing that went wrong was our server didn't take our order until about 30 minutes after we were seated.  The second thing that went wrong was that the complimentary bread that came out (in super cute little pots) was COLD.  Then the waitress forgot about our cocktails and we had to remind her to bring them.  To make matters worse, she decided to tell us some ridiculous story about how the bartender had to go the cellar to get wine and that's why the drinks were late.  \n\nAnd here we get to the worst part of the meal.  Our check.  First of all, when the waitress handed us the check, she told us that a 18% gratuity had been added because our party was larger than 7.  Of course, this we expected, but when we looked at the bill, they had NOT added the gratuity.  We told her so, and she adjusted the bill to reflect that.  Then, the Bachelorette in our party told us that she had given her credit card to the hostess (on a fake restroom run), and that the bill should have been taken care of.  We asked our waitress for the credit card, and that we would be paying for the meal.  However, they could not locate the credit card.  It took them a good 30 minutes for them to track it down.  HOW RIDICULOUS WAS THAT?!  The entire time, we're just waiting and waiting, and it was FREEZING outdoors.  No offer for blankets, no one in upper management to come out and apologize to us.  I don't understand how an upscale restaurant in a nicer hotel on the Strip could be THIS BAD.\n\nAt this point, I'm just venting, so I'm just going to end this review here.\n\nI WOULD NEVER EVER EVER go back to Tableau.  I would NEVER recommend it to ANYONE.  You can get good food elsewhere.  Seriously.  Don't go here.  It's not worth it.  I created a Yelp account JUST TO REVIEW THIS RESTAURANT because it was so horrible."

I think the security guards that helped me and my friend actually find this restaurant were more accommodating than the staff that worked here.  Although we did make reservations, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, even though half the dining room was empty.\n\nTHE FOOD -\n\nI ordered Tableau's parfait for starters but I said no peanuts because I'm highly allergic to peanuts; what do you know? There's a cashew in my parfait! Last time I checked, a cashew was a peanut. I didn't send it back because my friend wanted to eat it, but there is a lack in communication that I do not tolerate. \n\nMy entree, I ordered the Tableau Breakfast, since nothing else was very appetizing to me on their menu. I asked for eggs over medium and my eggs were runnier than the Nile River, it was like soup and I just couldn't eat it. Big let down.  The Pastry basket that came with my meal was pretty cool, but it lacked anything I liked.\n\nI think I only enjoyed the tea I had, which came in a cute little pyramid package! Very delicious tea!\n\nA side note: You have to be dressed well to be seated; meaning, shirts are mandatory and you can't wear a swim suit without a cover-up."

I walked in with my girlfriend on a beautiful Saturday cheery and happy ready to enjoy my vacation.  After we checked in with the sweet hostess, she told us we had a 25 min wait which we were ok with.  I asked her where we can grab quick coffee before we get seated and she directed us to the bar.  We walked over to the bar and attempted to sit down.  Before our butt was was on the chair Marie came by with a very awful attitude.  \"Are you just having coffee?\"  \"Yes, may we?\" I replied.  She rolled her eyes at my friend and I and say \"sure, I guess,\" with great hesitation.  So I stood up and said \"it's ok, if you don't want us here, we will leave.\"  We walked out.  Horrible right?  You don't like you job, quit!  You don't want to be nice, quit!  It's not my responsibility for your misery!!!\n\nI waited for twenty mins until our table was up at which point I talked to the lady manager and explained the situation.  She seemed nice about it and assured me that she will talk to Marie.\n\nWe proceeded with our meal.  The saving grace for the restaurant was in fact the rest of our experience was positive.

However, my friend was enticed by their signature \"Milk and Cookies Souffl\u00e9\" and wanted to dine there. \n\nAfter looking through the online menu myself, I was sold on the Kobe burger. What carnivore can ever turn down a good burger? Certainly NOT me...so we decided to come to Tableau for a late brunch during our Vegas trip.\n\nTableau is inconspicuously located in the Tower Suites of The Wynn where you have to walk through the casino and pass the High Roller area before you see a sign for it. If you're not familiar w/ the layout of the casino, it can be confusing, so make sure to ask one of the employees lingering in the area for directions. \n\nMy friend and I promptly arrived for our 1 PM reservations on Saturday, 7.31.10 and were seated at a table overlooking the pool area. \n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\n*Fresh Watermelon Juice ($6): Refreshingly light and sweet.  \n\n*Kobe Burger w/ Old Bay Fries ($16): OMG--SO GOOD! The thick Kobe patty was perfectly grilled to a medium w/ a soft pink center topped w/ an ooey goeey melted aged cheddar, nestled against fresh ripen beef steak tomato slices, butter lettuce, pickles, crisp red onions and then sandwiched between a toasted homemade sesame bun. \n\nAs I bit into the burger, I got a slight crisp from the toasted bun and veggies before my teeth sunk into the tender patty, which was so moist, that juices started to dribble down the bread and onto my plate. Since the bread was toasted on both sides, it held everything together in place just fine. The burger had the perfect combo of crispiness from the bread and lettuce, tender savoryness from the kobe, saltiness from the cheddar, and a slight tang from the pickles.\n\nThe fries were perfectly crisp and the old bay seasoning added a kick from red and black peppers, cloves, and all spice. The homemade ketchup was the perfect accompaniment; you can really taste the fresh tangy sweetness from the vine ripen tomatoes which added a zing to the burger and fries. \n\n*Milk & Cookies Souffl\u00e9 ($10): It was ok and was nothing to write home about. I prefer my souffl\u00e9 light and fluffy, and Tableu's souffl\u00e9 was on little on the heavy and dry side. The vanilla ice cream was rich and smooth, and the chocolate sauce was thick and decadent. It was a great contrast of temperatures and textures, but again, I wasn't keen on the souffl\u00e9's dryness. \n\nSERVICE:\nOur server was pretentious and not friendly. He never cracked a smile the entire a time and was pretty much gone after he took our order. He was only there to give us our dessert and our bill (after having to ask a busboy). I had to ask for my water to be refilled, which is pretty much a no-no at a more upscale dining establishment.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nClassy; crisp white linen tables, a gold chandelier, and tan curtains draped against large windows overseeing the pool area. Tables are well spaced out to allow for a more intimate dining w/ your party and for ease of conversation. \n\nIf you're looking for a nice, serene place for breakfast/brunch after a night of heavy drinking and debauchery, Tableau is the perfect place..."

My brother did not like the pancakes, they were pretty average, my mother enjoyed her oatmeal, and my husband ate his entire omelet.  No children under 5 allowed."

This review was based on January 2015 and I read that there is a new chef taking over. I'm willing to give this restaurant another chance when I'm in Vegas. \n\nI was so excited to try the ricotta lemon pancake which lead to disappointment because the pancake could be more fluffy and tasty. I felt like I was munching on endless stack of bread. My friend ordered the continental breakfast set which came with miniature pastries. It was really just okay for a $30 breakfast set. \n\nTableau is tucked in the 1st floor near the guest elevator and the lobby. It's quite hidden. I will return again for the fresh juices and hopefully the new chef will freshen up the menu and food."

I went most recently in the second week of May 2012 for breakfast. I remember coming here and getting awesome, elaborate breakfast items that were meticulously prepared and completely delicious. Now you get pedestrian choices that are pretty \"meh.\" \n\nI told the server that I had had a crab benedict there that I really enjoyed, he asked the chef if he could accommodate and the chef agreed. I got my crab benedict. It was a very boring and normal-looking eggs benedict but it had some wet crab meat slopped on it. Blah.\n\nService is amazing as always, everyone knows your name right away, and fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious of course. But the food, repeatedly, has been very meh. Las Vegas is not a city to be a \"meh\" restaurant in. On top of that, Tableau is retardedly expensive - two orange juices, a crab benedict and a regular benedict, tax and tip - $80.\n\nI notice that for guests of the Tower Suites at the Wynn, all the food at Tableau is free.  I don't know how long they have been doing that, maybe it has contributed to a decline in quality as hitting food costs may no longer be relevant. I also understand that a new chef recently took over, which makes me even more sad, because at the beginning of a new chef's tenure he should be producing outstanding food to build a reputation. This is not really happening. Guests around us slogged through their overpriced breakfasts with blank, apathetic expressions. \n\nTableau closed, then changed names, reopened, then changed names again, then got a new leader. Not surprising the food got left behind. Two stars for overpriced meh breakfast."

Tableu is located near the guests elevators at Wynn. \nImpeccable service, quality food, and presentation.\n\nI shared the granola parfait as a starter. Their housemaid granola was very fresh and crunchy. I know know if they couldn't get the right balance since this was shared, but it felt like it needed little more yogurt. Even the half size parfait filled me up pretty well with all the healthy granola.\n\nNautica Benedict: Perfection. Their hollandaise was very flavorful and creamy. I'm a huge fan of lox, so this smoked salmon caper mix eggs benedict was a perfect choice.\n\nBrown Butter Apple Pancakes: Fluffy pancakes with cadied pecans and roasted warm apples had the right amount of sweetness. Their portions are generous.\n\nI didn't have reservations, but we were seated right away. I recommend that you make reservations though to be seated in the terrace/balcony area overlooking the gorgeous Wynn pool.\n\nI would come back for a classy brunch here over Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.

Now on to the food. \n\nI  ordered the mixed greens which tasted fresh and the dressing was light rather than overpowering as most dressings seem to be these days. It allowed the flavor of the various greens to shine through. Afterword for the main course I got the wild mushroom tamales. They were moist and fluffy. The seasonings were just perfect, and the jicama on the side really hit the spot. These were the best tamales I have ever had, though to be honest I am not a tamale connoisseur.\n\nAfter lunch we sat back with some tea and enjoyed the myriad of birds flying around and even attracted quite a few by feeding them a bit of scraps.

My best buddy was the bread roll which was fresh baked and highly necessary to absorb the salt I ingested later.  (See further below)\n...The Dungeness Crab Club was reasonable but nothing to write home about.  The sweet tomatoes that they put in there does add some color into an otherwise mild sandwich but other than that, just okay.\n...The French Fries are indeed soggy as another reviewer mentioned, but I think they're supposed to be that way?  Maybe?  I dunno.  One way or the other, I didn't think they were all that.  The homemade ketchup however was sweet and delicious and made the fries worth eating.\n...The Lobster Bisque really bugged.  This thing was far too hot and extremely salty; it tasted like a sweaty armpit.  Anyone who might have bothered to have tasted it before it left the kitchen would have known how wretched it was.  When the waiter failed to notice my repugnance with the soup, I called him on it and told him to just take it away.  To their credit, the chef admitted that the base had been reduced too far, apologized and brought another bowl which was STILL salty but at least edible this time and at a temperature lower than that of lava.  But guys: You never tasted the soup even once before coming out of the kitchen?  EPIC FAIL.\n- Lobster Bisque: 1/5 (2/5*)\n- Dungeness Crab Club: 3/5\n- Fries: 3/5\n- Bread Roll:  4/5\n\n\n2) SERVICE\nI originally told the maitre'd I was very hot from walking the strip and wanted something away from the windows.  So she promptly disregarded my request and put me next to the windows while saying she'd drop the shades.  So she did and it made no frickin' difference. \n...With the great bisque debacle, the service in my mind kinda hit a skid.  The chef failed to identify any issues with soup, nor did the waiter care about the fact that I wasn't eating it.\n...To their credit, the busboys were huffin' it.  Grabbed plates quickly, filled my glass promptly.\n...But when it came to picking up my credit card, no one was to be found.  I couldn't even find someone to ask, so I flipped out my money roll and paid cash instead and walked out.\n\n\n\n3) LOCATION\nThe location is great, like most restaurants at Wynn.  It's a private area behind High Limit Slots past the Tower Suites registration.  Clearly it's aimed at the Tower Suites clientele.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nI might go back with the wife. I suspect that I just had a one-time bad experience but what bugs me is that nothing really stood out in my meal at all to compel me to care about coming back to this restaurant.  I hope I'm wrong.\n\nI think based on the people that were there when I went, this is more of a \"ladies who lunch\" sort of joint in the morning & mid-day.  Lots of wifes from the 'upper crust' Tower Suites co-mingling and lunching together."

All of the major spots were already booked. So, I changed my approach and went to the open table website and looked for restaurants that still had open seats. This is actually a great way of booking a restaurant during a busy weekend. It worked out well and I will do this again. Tableau had good reviews on yelp (which is my go to source) so I booked it. The restaurant is located near the tower suites in the Wynn. The decor in the tower suites area is very well done. It is airy and opulent with light marble and soft green tones. Definitely a ladies who lunch kind of vibe. The restaurant was actually less impressive in comparison. The design on the back of the chairs is horrible. \n\nFood: \nWe started off by sharing a large chocolate croissant which was just okay. It had been coated with butter which gave the pastry a greasy look. The texture was flaky and served warmed. The temperature was good but I usually like my croissants a bit more doughy.  I had the Spanish 3 egg omelet. It was very flavorful. I would recommend it. The only thing I would say is that the chorizo is more like a spicy ham that chorizo. But still, good. My husband ordered the filet and eggs. His dish was basic. There was no sauce or dressing given with the steak. The meat was over-salted and cut did not seem like a true filet cut.\n\nHighlight:\nAll in all it was a good experience. I'm glad we checked it out. But, there are so many other places to check out at the Wynn that we'll try somewhere else next time. We are new to the area and the best part of the brunch was that we discovered the Wynn hotel. The garden was decorated with an all flower carrousel. It was dreamy."

Its the simple things that really excite me and I was practically knocked out of my chair when I ordered a sampling of toast and received homemade jams (and trust me you can tell it is fresh made).  The orange marmalade had the most perfect ring of orange rind that was never ending, someone had hand peeled that orange rind all the way from top to bottom without once breaking the peel, it was candied and caramelized to perfection. \n I go to Tableau every time I come to Vegas, it is that good.  However, my recent concern is regarding the change in chefs, the original chef of Tableau has now opened Botero in Encore.

Many places (understandably) will not consider a wait list for breakfast or brunch unless you go to their establishment. And we just didn't want to wait in a long line. \n\nSHORT VERSION: food = 5 stars; service = 3/4 stars; ambiance = 5 stars\n\nFOOD: Come on, it's the Wynn, so quality is on the menu. And the options include simple American fare: steak sandwiches, seafood soup, basic breakfasts, and a few (but not a wealth of) respectful vegetarian and vegan options added balance to what seemed like a fairly basic breakfast menu.  And everything we ate (see above) was delicious. The bread basket was outstanding and the homemade jams and ketchup were stand outs. \n\nSide note: I think they have the best fries in town. I haven't collected any data or done any local fry comparison, but those fries were perfect. I said it--perfect. \n\nDECOR: I loved the indoor design and color scheme. I admit to finding other parts of the Wynn a little ornate for my taste, but the light colors and romantic shapes coupled with the with the mixed motifs on the upholstery leads to a modern/light/elegant feel to the space. Outside the landscaping and arrangement does all of the ambiance work. As it should. The pool area isn't \"pretty\", but the strategic use of foliage and color and shape make it feel special. I don't know that any casino in town has provided as much outdoor restaurant space as the Wynn has. \n\nSERVICE: Surprisingly, the service left me wavering between 3 and 4 stars for the experience. Our glasses were left empty for so long that we finally had to flag down a different waiter to request service. While not our waiter, the man who helped us was incredibly accommodating and responsive.  But the lapse of service outside was not limited to our table. And that was a disappointment.  Does it even need to be said that part of the experience in a place like Tableau is the service? \n\nIS IT \"DRIVE TO THE STRIP WORTHY\"? No. \n\nOVERALL:  I enjoyed the meal (particularly the fries) and would return with guests. But I didn't love it because of the lapse in service and the simplicity of the dishes.  If I want brunch on the strip with a nice outdoor view and I don't need to make reservations, there are  options where service is always spot on and I enjoy a slightly more creative menu.  The spotty service was a surprise as a Wynn property, but more disappointing was the feeling that this level of service was not unusual for the outdoor seating area.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and am confident others would as well, but I am not in a rush to get back."

            "review": "My gf has been wanting to try Tableau since her last visit to Vegas and this time around she said she'll treat my parents and me to brunch there.  My entire experience was very good except for a couple of minor blimps.\n\nWhen I called in to make the reservation the lady's tone of voice, personality, friendliness is what epitomizes Wynn.  I have never stayed at their hotel but that experience there tells me why they won the five diamond award.  The reservationist was polite, friendly, and just made sure to cover points that I would never have even thought of and best of all she got me excited about dining there.\n\nUpon arriving (we arrived right on time) our table wasn't ready and we waited for 20 minutes.  Even though they apologized a few times when we were seated I would have appreciated if they told us at the ten minute mark why the table wasn't ready or at least update us.  The only things we were told were\"just a moment\" and \"we are working on it.\"  \n\nFor brunch we ordered the scrambled eggs with duck and puff pastry, eggs with elk, a traditional breakfast with eggs, toasts, bacon, a pastry/muffin basket, and a tofu napoleon.  I can't comment on the tofu but my mom liked it a lot.  The traditional breakfast's muffin basket was delicious.  It came with strawberry jam, what seems to be orange zest, and something similar to devonshire cream.  The elk and the eggs were disappointing.  The elk was just a piece of meat patty that wasn't very good.  The scrambled eggs on both dishes (elk and duck) were a bit runny for my taste.  The duck and egg was decent but as I said it would have been better if the scrambled eggs weren't as runny.\n\nService is excellent.  They have notes ready for the waiters so they address you as Mr. or Ms. or Mrs. so and so.\n\nThe ambiance in the restaurant is terrific.  On a sunny day it's like sitting inside a open window conservatory with the garden and pool right outside.  While the views can be nice, it can also be negated by out of shape men wearing their swim trunks walking around and talking on the phone.\n\nThis is a place you should try and I'll most definitely come back again."

Expect, to spend more than you're use to. 2) It's in the Wynn Encore. Do I need to say more? 3) You're on vacation, splurge (if you don't have the money, then why are you here?)\n\nMoving on to the food, by far the best breakfast I've ever had. I've been to Vegas twice in the past 3 years and each visit, I have breakfast here at least 3 times. I LOVE the pancakes, super moist and fluffy. The first time I ever had it, I had the Huckleberry Pancake (seasonal), it was just sooo delicious, I went back the next day just for this. The Norwegian Eggs Benedict, was simply divine, the best I ever had and trust me I've had this plenty of times from high end restaurants to your lower end. And to top it all off, the coffee was amazing. I don't know what kind of blend it is or even if it's anything special, but it was very aromatic, not too bitter, you can definitely tell it was brewed at the right temperature.\n\nI cannot wait for my next visit to Vegas. Definitely coming back!\n\n(And yes, my review is catered towards breakfast only. I have not been here for lunch or dinner.)"

It was my last day in Vegas, so I was going big. Started with a Mimosa and the orange juice was so delicious. Next we ordered oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktail and ahi tar tar. All of the items were fresh beautifully presented and sooo efffinn delicious!! We took our time and the wait staff was patient, and I believe by my fourth mimosa my eggs benedict came. It was classic, simple, and perfect! I was so pleased with the whole experience. To top it all of, my friend order strawberries with a lemon almond creme and shortbread. Just when I thought this place couldn't get any better: it did! It was like heaven in my mouth... uugghhh! Wish I could go back ASAP. It's at the Wynn, which is an amazing hotel regardless, so make the trip!!!!"

Nice decor, bright, airy and not too cold.  \nThe food was not at all like the reviews said regarding the smoked salmon eggs benedict.  I'm not sure, but I would guess people are impressed by how much smoked salmon there was.  The smoked salmon was good but the eggs and hollandaise were soooo bland. Completely tasteless.  I must have read 10 reviews about how good this dish was and could not believe how bland it was.  I dine constantly in big cities so yes, the prices are remarkably high but I'm fine paying $27 for a dish if it is delicious but this was not.  It was so bland (except for the smoked salmon) and I wasn't fooled into thinking it was good because they gave me a ton of smoked salmon (and it was good not great smoked salmon).  \nThis was not even close to my best meal in Vegas and I would not recommend it.\nMy friends said their omlettes were good."

I think this dish would have been awesome with regular sausage or bacon.  The potato hash and poached egg were very good.   My friend had the crab club sandwich, which he said was very good, although the fries which came with it were slightly salty and over seasoned.  The maine lobster was good, as was the kobe burger.   My favorite dish was the poached eggs and duck hash, it was presently beautifully on top of a pastry puff, and the flavors were delicious!   \n\n We ended with the signature souffl\u00e9, which did not fail to disappoint!  Overall, the food was good, but I would have liked a little more variety for brunch.  I think Bouchon has a better brunch menu, prices at Tableau are slightly higher than Bouchon, and the portions are smaller here...but the signature souffl\u00e9 is excellent!  Non of the dishes which we tried were unsatisfying  or disappointing , but most of them did not stand out as great or exceptional... besides the Duck Hash and the Souffl\u00e9.   I think I would come back only for a glass of fresh squeezed juice and a souffl\u00e9, now that's the right way to start off your day in vegas!"

            "review": "I went to Tableau on the recommendation of two friends who had eaten brunch there the previous day - and who wanted our whole group to go back for lunch before we left Vegas.  Vegas has a lot of restaurants (in case you didn't know) so the fact that these two felt strongly about eating at the same spot twice in a three day trip bode well for our meal.\n\nAnd holy moly roly poly.  I'd eat here every day if I could.  First of all, the place is darling.  It feels intimate and the decor is vaguely dollhouse, a great spot for a fancy tea party.  Or brunch, I suppose.  The service - stellar.  The presentation is sweet, with bread in individual tins and hot chocolate served in a fancy pot.  But most important - the food is superb!  \n\nI started with a warm portobello mushroom soup that was poured out of a beautiful little teapot over some little lobster raviolis.  This is one of the best soups I've ever had the pleasure of planting my face in, with deep flavor and that perfect buttony mushroom texture.  After polishing that off like a starved orphan, I moved on to an outstanding steak salad with balsamic, blue cheese, bacon, and more mushrooms.  That was another clean plate.  I finished out the meal (hey, it was my last of the trip, don't judge) with a gorgeous parfait with plenty of berries and lemon custard that was out of this world.  My friends all seemed to enjoy their food as well, and the miscellaneous bites I stole were all fantastic.  I will also mention that the fries are great, and the homemade ketchup (in which you can actually see tiny seeds!) is really several cuts above the bottled stuff.  Definitely give this place a go.  I can't wait to go back."

            "review": "See profile site for full review with formatted pics.\n\nChatting on his Vertu in a strange language (something arabic I believe) I couldn't help but notice my neighbor's Constantin Patrimony Series watch flashing in the sunlight of Tableau's patio...clearly there was money around. When the waiter arrived to refill his water and asked if he could get the check the man pulled out a money clip, peeled off two $100 bills and said \"that should cover it\" before getting up and walking away...the man had ordered a fruit plate. Tucked away in the gardens and pools of the Wynn Tableau is both rich and beautiful in appearance, much like its patrons. Sure I didn't expect low quality from Steve Wynn, but to say the clientele of Tableau was \"well to do\" would be a vast understatement.\n\nArriving at 7:45am I was greeted by the gorgeous lobby and the gracious hostess who asked whether I would prefer dining indoors or on the patio. As the patio was amply shaded and most of the patrons were outside I chose the patio and was subsequently offered a copy of the Wallstreet Journal, New York Times, or USA Today to browse. Seeing the headlines regarding the USC upset, I opted for the USA Today (clearly indicating my status compared to the rest of the diners who sat browsing the Times or Journal) and chose a wonderful table half sunny/half shaded with a great view of the pool and gardens. Water was filled and the menu was delivered while the waiter went to get my coffee.\n\nBrowsing the menu I was instantly captured by the pastry basket and the Peach pancakes, but not being hungry enough for both decided to ask the waiter what was available in the basket. Approximately 10 items were rattled off including an apricot tart, apple scone, and nectarine turnover. When I asked if pastries could be ordered individually it was explained that these were 'petite' pastries and if I wanted to try only one it would be free of charge. \"A nectarine turnover and the peach pancakes, please.\" \"Certainly, sir.\"\n\nWhile I waited for my food I stood up and roamed the pools and gardens. Approximately 20 people were present at the time, all dressed either business casual or semi-formal and all dining on items ranging from the freshest appearing fruits to pastries to eggs and sausage that looked incredible. When I returned to my table (my tableau?) my coffee was waiting along with cream and sugar/spelda/equal. No nutrasweet was to be seen and when asked I was informed \"Mr Wynn does not fancy nutrasweet.\" Fair enough (for what it is worth, Alex also didn't have Nutrasweet but noted they could obtain it immediately if I desired.)\n\nAfter approximately 10 minutes a fantastic yet dainty apricot turnover arrived fresh from the oven. Crispy, flaky, loaded with fresh nectarines it was the perfect opener to the meal and I'd have certainly enjoyed many more had I ordered the basket. Another 10 minutes and a laugh at the Trojans passed, my coffee was refilled once, and then my pancakes emerged from the kitchen.\n\nDescribed in the menu as Ricotta Peach Pancakes with lime butter and organic maple syrup, nothing could've prepared me for these pancakes. Fluffy and light, airy yet moist, sweet yet savory and absolutely jammed with fresh skinned peaches, the dish was presented with a simple dusting of powdered sugar, a side-pitcher of warm syrup, and a dollop on the side that tasted like a fresh key lime dissolved in butter. Having tried Ricotta Pancakes only once before but any number of stellar pancakes in the past, this dish was a revolution and I truly sat and savored each bite. Sure, $14 for three pancakes is not a bargain, but $14 for breakfast bliss? That is a bargain.\n\nWhen I finished my pancakes and resisted the urge to lick my plate clean my waiter arrived and asked if he could get me anything else. \"Perhaps a coffee to go?\" \"....don't twist my arm....how about another turnover too?\" \"Certainly, sir.\" While I didn't tip $185 like my neighbor, I certainly wish I could have.\n\nOn my way out everyone was very friendly, from the other waiters to the hostess, making each guest feel like their visit was truly valued. I was even invited to return for dinner, but when I told the hostess we had reservations for Alex that evening she noted \"oh, excellent choice, perhaps some other time.\" All told the meal was fantastic and on par with Bouchon in terms of quality, presentation, and service. Go early, sit on the patio, eat, smile, and enjoy the richness of the food and the clientele...even if you yourself aren't rich...sometimes it's fun to see how the upper crust lives."

The ambiance is extremely impressive, with such a classy setup that I completely forgot I was in the middle of Sin City. \n\nBesides the ambiance though, I was rather disappointed by almost everything else. The service was downright terrible, with our waiter practically ignoring our table and us having to ask multiple times to get our water refilled. One redeeming factor about the long wait for food is that they brought out a complimentary plate of fruit. \n\nThe food was alright, but definitely not the quality I would expect when paying so much. The Salmon Eggs Benedict was a bit bland, and the crab sandwich had way too much batter (seriously to the point I could not taste crab anymore). The Banana Sour Cream Pancakes were great, but not worth the $17 price tag. \n\nAlso, a lot of the photos on Yelp show the most delicious looking milk chocolate souffl\u00e9 cake. When I asked the waiter about it, he said the souffl\u00e9 was discontinued over 2 years ago :(\n\nTableau had the potential to be great, I just wish it was executed better."

As the fruit compote soaked into each pancake, my breakfast experience would increase exponentially toward heaven.  But the sausage--oh! the sausage--was to die for.  I dreamt of that sausage for weeks and want to go back just for a side order of sausage with those delectable pancakes.  Their sausage, made in house, has a perfect texture and the right thickness of skin that has that bite to it when you chew it.  The flavors of the apple and chicken mixture are heaven on my palette and I could eat fifty more in one sitting.  \n\nYou must eat breakfast here.  Their pancakes are worth the 18 dollar price tag, as is that heavenly sausage.  Please, I beg of you--try this place if you have the time. You won't regret it.\n\nTip: make reservations.

There are some hiccups in the operations however that left us feeling frustrated.\n\nAs Tower Suite guests, we were told upon check-in that our complimentary breakfasts would be at Tableau. We were shown where it was and given the hours.\n\nThe first morning there, we had a lovely experience. We were seated immediately, and our server was wonderful. She even helped direct us on where to go to reserve a pool cabana for the day. \n\nWe were given the menus specifically for Tower Suite guests. We couldn't choose from the entire menu for our breakfast, but the menu they provided was still great. I went with the Garden Frittata and it was delicious. Husband went with a salmon bagel. Based on Day 1, our experience would have been 5 stars.\n\nMorning 2, a Wednesday, we came down. The restaurant was a little busier than the day before, but there was still lots of seating. Maria at the hostess table told us it would be a 45 minute wait for a table without a reservation. Rewind to our check-in, no one told us to make reservations. They told us to just head on down between the specified hours. Marcelo told them that we are tower suite guests, and we were then offered a table outside. Fine! After the lecture on reservations, we made a reservation for the following morning at 9:15 am, just to avoid any issue.\n\nWe were seated outside were we had our choice between quite a few tables. I naturally grabbed one in the shade. Again, the food was great. I went with whole wheat pancakes with a side of veggie sausage. Marcelo had the acai, and as a Brasilian, he confirmed that it's a good one. No complaints on food.\n\nAt the end of the meal, their computers went down so we had to wait awhile for our receipt. They all had to be handwritten by the manager. It finally arrived, and we were on our way.\n\nDay 3! We head on down at 9:10 for our 9:15 reservation! The young girl at the front desk can't find it. She says it was never put in. We stressed that we made it the day before with Maria after the whole ordeal. We sat outside and waited about 10-15 minutes for a table.\n\nOnce seated, we were handed the full menus. We asked for the menus that guests of the tower get, the ones we were given the previous 2 days. Our waitress told us she had to check on our reservation. She came back and said that the front desk told her that our complimentary breakfasts were at the buffet. News to us!!! We told her that the front desk told us it was HERE, and that it wasn't a problem the previous two days. She was a little uncomfortable and clearly didn't know what to say or do. We just ordered from the full menus.\n\nIt was a really frustrating experience. We came to the Wynn to spend money and be treated well. We did everything we were told to do, and things still went wrong. Plus, who we see and how we are treated at breakfast set the tone for the whole day! After going back and forth with our server this morning that we were in the correct place and have her not even try to do any problem solving, we sat in frustrated silence while waiting for our food to arrive. We concluded that we should have stayed at the Cosmo instead. We came to spend 4 days before this baby comes out of me, so we were looking to spend a lot of money (which we did) and have fun. It just sucks to be treated poorly, knowing how much money we pumped into the building the last 4 days. We definitely felt like if you're young with money, this isn't the place for you."

The tuna tartare was the best lunch I had while in Vegas.  I only wish I had discovered Tableau before our last day in Vegas.  I would have eaten there everyday!"

The wait staff was very attentive and shared their thoughts on the various food items.  The food itself was just delectable - honestly one of the best meals I have had and unanimously the best meal in Vegas on this trip for all 11 people in our party.   Nautica benedict (with salmon) was a perfect blend of lox/bagel and traditional benedict with egg and hollandaise sauce.  Filet mignon on the benedict was just as awesome.  Pancakes and French toast were specially prepared and put on a whole new level that is just difficult to explain.  The only thing I was disappointed with was that it was my daughter's birthday and the waitress said that they usually have a little dessert that they put a candle in - but since it was Valentines Day they had a special Valentine's dessert and asked if I'd like them to put the candle in that instead - so I agreed - under the assumption that this was a complimentary item...it wasn't...it was $12 for something we wouldn't have ordered.  Luckily - the rest of the experience was great and I chalked it up to miscommunication."

I had their French toast infused with orange and topped with honey butter one morning, then their peach pancakes the next morning. Both are solid choices if your sweet tooth is in need of some caring for breakfast. \n\nMy side of eggs were cooked perfectly, over-easy, just how I like them. I had a sampling of the breakfast potatoes which were as delicious as breakfast potatoes should be. I was hoping the elk sausage would be savory...and only savory. If you're not into sweet and savory simultaneously on your taste buds, pass on the elk. \n\nDrinks? I heard their coffee was great and their watermelon juice was amazing. \n\nDear vegan and vegetarian friends, don't worry, they (along with several other restaurants in the Wynn and Encore) have a vegan menu as well...

We were comped our meals and looking for a place to eat, and after one look at this place, we instantly chose it for lunch.  They have a very unique polygonal room at the end of the restaurant and that is where we chose to sit.  On a nice day, they do have service outside along the terrace which is wonderful, but that day was cold so we opted to stay inside.\n\nService was good enough in the beginning.  We ordered the seared sea scallops, caesar salad, yellowfin tuna tartare and the steak.  They came out with fresh bread and butter and the bread was individually baked and presented.  That in itself deserves the 5-star rating.  Next we were presented with our main courses, but they somehow forgot about the tuna tartare.  The steak was medium rare, cooked perfectly over polenta.  The sea scallops (5) were also perfectly cooked and with a nice tangy salad in the middle.  My Caesar salad had whole romaine leaves and the perfect amoutn of dressing was added.  The bread croutons and saved cheese was also tasty.  My tuna tartare came out very late, but definitely well worth the wait.  Large chunks of tuna with mango and avocado and hot sauce was absolutely amazing.\n\nI really can't forget the tuna tartare, and I kept raving about it at Vegas.  I was told by our server that Steve Wynn himself orders double orders of the tuna whenever he stays in the hotel.\n\nTuna Tartare = $24\nSteak = $22\nSeared Sea Scallops = $27\nCaesar Salad = $14"

Seriously, their White Chocolate Orange French Toast is something that every breakfast lover needs to experience at least once.  \n\nEverything else we tried was solid but just a bit off the mark.\n\n- Appetizer: The roasted beets were great but the balsamic drizzle was a little off-putting.\n- Entrees: Aside from the heavenly french toast, we also got their duck hash.  It was tasty but more like a pot pie.  Then again, duck hash is my favorite breakfast ever, so I'm especially picky about it.\n- Side: Their bacon's nothing special.\n- Drinks: The ShowStopper cocktails were refreshing but just a little too sweet.\n\nAll in all, Tableau's a great brunch spot with prompt, friendly service, and the portions don't make you feel like a glutton.

While it has a dressier atmosphere, it didn't require you to dress up necessarily, just wear some non-raggedy half decent clothes.  It's located in the hotel area after you walk through the entire casino if you park in self parking.\n\nThe hostess and server were pleasant so it set up for a relaxed lunch.\n\nI got the:\n- Pan seared fish (for the life of me I can't remember the name of the fish, but it was a smaller white fish)\n\nwhile others got:\n- Napoleon of savory tofu, dressed with a mirepoix-like spicy ratatouille and fried eggplant\n- Kobe burger\n- Roasted chicken\n\nThe fish was well prepared with the outside a light crispness and the fish moist and soft.  Not overly sauced or seasoned.  The fish flavor was the main event just how I like it.\n\nI was also able to taste the vegan Napolean which had a light but nice flavor with the combination of the tofu and more flavorful eggplant. Although I'm no vegetarian by any means, I love eggplant and better quality tofu so this may be an entree I choose next time if I'm feeling like something light and healthy.  The server told us this was what Steve Wynn gets every time he comes.\n\nThe Kobe burger was just another disappointing Kobe burger.  I have never liked any of the Kobe burgers I've ever had as they are more expensive and very average tasting.  American Kobe beef just isn't that good.  I've had a 100x better burger for $4 in Carbondale, CO at Fatbelly Burger where they serve natural grass fed beef burgers and of course in Japan where some places actually use real wagyu (Japanese beef).  That'll run you about the same price or more though as an American Kobe burger.\n\nThis is a place where you can kind of escape the lights and noises of Vegas to have a pleasant meal in a pleasant atmosphere.  I'll keep this one in my pocket as an option for lunch and maybe breakfast/brunch as that looks good too.\n\n4 stars all around for ambience, service and food."

It was my husband's bday and he really wanted to go somewhere for a nice breakfast. Since we were staying at Encore we made the short walk over to Tableau and were seated pretty much immediately in the atrium section. \n\nI ordered the omelet and fresh berries and he had elk sausage and eggs. I can't say anything bad about my plate...it was delicious, however, after my hubby took a couple bites out of his he noticed his eggs were cold and the potatoes were not all done, yet the sausage was warm. He told the server right away and he took his dish back to the kitchen. Our server came back and apologized and informed us that the executive chef himself was going to remake the dish and it would be out shortly. \n\nWell I continued on with my omelet and after a few minutes the server brought out a new elk sausage and eggs. After already consuming about half of this one my hubby realized that the potatoes were still not done. He was really upset b/c he was really excited about breakfast, and it just seemed as though they just couldn't get his dish right. \n\nWe also noticed they never brought out his orange juice that he ordered and brought that to the waiter's attention. He apologized again and brought us out not only an orange juice, but Apple juice and a grapefruit juice to try. He also brought us out a complimentary pastry basket to try and make up for everything. You could tell he was genuinely sorry about messing up lee's order and the dishes not coming out right! \n\nFor my breakfast I would give this place a 4 star, however, for the hubby's and especially since it was his bday I can only let them get away with 3 stars.  Sorry Tableau...I wish you could have made a better impression with us! . Also, if we would have had a better breakfast experience with you it may have motivated us to make it up for more breakfast's in the future, but I think we'll keep passing for now!"

The decor is like that of a high tea room with a little bit of edge, as can be seen by the artsy drawings of animals on the backs of the chairs which make the decor unique. \n\nService: very attentive staff. Great service.\n\nFood: very mediocre overall. The first day I got the frittata which was ok but nothing amazing. A little bland. Second time there I got the vegetarian eggs Benedict which was DISGUSTING. A couple of soggy pieces of wheat bread topped off with watery scrambled tofu and veggie sausage that tasted like it was warmed up after frozen. I rarely send food back and i sent this back. I thought Wynn was known for his vegetarian/ vegan choices but this menu needs to be revamped. Boyfriend got the Tableau breakfast which was good. Pastry basket was excellent.\n\nI would probably just come back for the pastries and maybe a juice, and avoid the breakfast choices until they are improved."

Came in about ten minutes after they just opened for breakfast on a Sunday with no reservations. We were easily accommodated as we were one of the first few there. Tip: if you do go later in the am, I recommend making reservations. By the time we were done eating, the restaurant was a lot more full.\n\nWe were fortunate enough to get seated with one of the best views in the conservatory. The lighting is beautiful, decor-very clean and pristine, and the view of the outdoor pool alongside cabanas makes you feel like you're not in Vegas. When the weather permits, I'm sure the outdoor area would be ideal.\n\nOrdered the Tableau breakfast, duck hash & eggs, and white chocolate orange fresh toast. Make sure if you order the Tableau breakfast to add your option of juice, coffee, or tea because our server never brought it up to us until we told her. Tip: there's a vegetarian menu for those who need it. \n\nEveryone received bite sized strawberry donuts compliments of the chef-nice touch. A pastry basket accompanies the Tableau breakfast that came with two palmiers, two blueberry muffins, and two pineapple pastries. They were okay. I, personally, ordered the duck hash & eggs and my favorite part about it was probably the pastry layer on the bottom. There was ample amount of duck, potatoes, topped with scrambled eggs and roasted tomato hollandaise sauce. Portion size is just right but I still did not finish mine as I found it too gamey and overwhelming to my palate after eating half of it. Also, I didn't taste much tomato flavor in the hollandaise sauce. Sorry! I know a lot of people on here raved about it but I guess it just didn't cater to my taste buds. The white chocolate orange french toast garnished with blueberries and orange slices was good but the white chocolate was too subtle that it tasted more like orange. \n\nOverall, this place is just alright. Our initial server was not the friendliest and she seemed annoyed by our indecisiveness. Food was ok and during our time here, we felt very uptight and as if we needed to be on our best behaviors. Just not my cup of tea. I'd return only if someone I knew really wanted to check it out."

            "review": "Tableau offers American cuisine by chef Mark LoRusso. I've had dinner here once, lunch once, and breakfast four times.\n\nThe dinner menu offers a wide choice of New American cooking. I'd call it fancy but not flashy. Breakfast and lunch are much simpler, but with a few fancy touches.\n\nThe room is quiet and formal. Tables are widely spaced, with long white table cloths and a single orchid in a bud vase, and sprays of Phalaenopsis orchids decorate the room. Soft music plays in the background. Service is efficient and attentive. In general, service has been friendly and efficient. Sadly, my lunch at Tableau was an exception. When it was time for the check, my server disappeared. I waited and waited and waited, even looking for someone else to help, but with no success. I finally felt it necessary to go to the hostess, and ask what had happened. My server never returned; someone else brought the check.\n\n\n** DINNER - TASTING MENU\nThe tasting menu is a good way to sample the best of what Tableau has to offer. I'm not much of a drinker, but decided to get the wine pairing as well.\n* Prior to ordering, the chef sent out as an amuse bouche a small sample of cream of potato and chorizo soup. It was full of potato flavor, with a hint of chorizo.\n* Osetra Caviar Trio. Each of the three items had a small amount of caviar on top: (1) a shot glass of potato soup, with creme fraiche on top, was thick and rich, served cold; good-very good; (2) traditional garnish of creme fraiche, chopped hard boiled egg and chopped onion, all in a china spoon; very good; (3) a scallop cooked on the medium side; very good.\n* Crab Minestrone. A clear soup with zucchini, beans, and lots of crab. The soup had a lot of flavor, the zucchini was crunchy, the beans were firm, the crab was sweet and firm.\n* Tasting of Foie Gras. A medium thick steak served on creamed corn. The foie gras was seared on the outside, and had a good flavor, but wasn't as good as at the top places in town.\n\nThis was this point at which I realized the generous wine pours were getting me drunk. I would drink only a fraction of each glass hereafter. However, it was too late. I would fall asleep several times. I think the server caught me once (\"Sir? SIR?\").\n\n* Pan Roasted Halibut. The fish was firm, cooked through but still moist. Outstanding flavor.\n* Prime Filet. The steak was good, but nowhere near as good as at SW Steakhouse.\n* Camembert. Nutty, bitter. I'm not a Camembert fan, so I rate it Fair.\n* Selection of Desserts: (1) Roasted banana ice cream had a strong banana flavor; very good. (2) Vanilla pot de creme was like pudding, but so much better. (3) Chocolate souffl was not the best I've had, but was still very good.\n\nOverall, a very good meal indeed. Beware the generous wine pours!\n\n\n** LUNCH\nMy only lunch at Tableau was a Dungeness Crab Club Sandwich. In lots of little ways, it was executed very well. The sourdough bread - all three layers - was nicely toasted and had very good flavor. It was firm enough to hold up as a triple decker sandwich, but still soft enough to be easily bitten through. The crab meat was plentiful and tasty. In addition, there were avocado slices, sprouts, sun dried tomatoes, and bacon. Somehow or other, I was able to eat this sandwich without having the contents spill out all over the place. Spiced French fries were served on the side, and were pretty good. Well done!\n\n\n** BREAKFAST\nMy breakfasts were:\n* Banana French Toast, made with raisin brioche and a layer of mashed bananas. The french toast was very good - crispy on the outside, soft inside. However, I thought the banana flavor was too strong, overpowering the rest. Chicken and apple sausage was surprisingly good.\n* Banana Ricotta Pancakes with Walnut Honey Butter. They were light to medium in texture, with a moderate banana flavor. They were pretty good, but not special.\n* Poached eggs and duck hash. This was actually part of the weekend brunch menu, but I ate early. The dish consisted of 2 poached eggs on top of a hash of shredded, slightly crisp duck meat, and fried finely diced potatoes. It was delicious.\n* Kobe short ribs and eggs. Two very attractive stacks, each consisting of: a round, thick, fried potato cake, greasy but good; shredded braised short ribs (very good flavor); gently cooked scrambled egg; a small amount of tangy barnaise sauce. It's very, very rich, but excellent. My favorite breakfast at Tableau.\n\n\n\nWhen I first ate dinner at Tableau, I knew I had just had a very good meal. The food wasn't flashy, but it was very good. Lunch was also very good. Breakfast was a harder sell. I think that part of the problem is that I'm very pedestrian in my tastes with respect to pancakes, French toast, and the like: keep 'em plain, just butter and a little syrup. I had a similar reaction to the highly praised French toast at Bouchon. As long as I stay away from sweet starchy breakfasts, I've been very happy with Tableau."

We thought about heading across the street, to find something at the Fashion Show Mall, but didn't want to waste precious pool time. \n\nWe didn't have a reservation, but were seated within 20 minutes.  It was a beautiful day and we had a table right by one of the open windows looking out on the pool. The hostess placed a tiny stool next to my chair for my purse to sit on. This was neat and strange at the same time, but nonetheless a nice touch. \n\nOur waiter was a bit of an odd character, just in a general sort of way. He wasn't too attentive either. I had an omelette with fontina, mushrooms and caramelized onions. There was too much cheese and onions for my liking. The potato cakes that came with it were delicious though. The toast, even though I requested it sans butter, was still enjoyable. My husband had the elk sausage and poached eggs and seemed to enjoy it. \n\nWe might go back if ever in the same situation, but there are too many other great places to try in LV for this place to make the rotation."

We each had a flight of juice and the omelette with mushrooms. They brought us the most divine cake/bread to start which was such a treat. The juices was delicious, my favorite was the orange zest. Our omelettes were light, fluffy, and quite tasty. The potato they served was just ok, but didn't distract from the meal. All was yummy. \n\nNow for the bad:  First of all, we had a reservation for 11am and we were not seated until 11:22. Once we were seated we were asked for our drink order and while our tea was brought, our water was never poured. When you want to be a 5* place, service counts. \n\nOur waitress is really where the value was lost. She was insincere, rushed, and not accommodating. When we asked to have our eggs scrambles one minute after we ordered, she said it was too late, the order was in. Food didn't come for at least 10 minutes later. Then, I had subbed the potato  and toast for a salad. She neglected to mention the upcharge and when we asked her about it, she was rude and obstinate. The manager did handle it well, though. \n\nFood was 5 star, service was not. Not sure if run back."

Wait 15 minutes and get taken to a table even though Im staring at 2 empty window seats. Tell the hostess what I originally said. wait 10 more minutes for a window. 2 window seats available. One still has not been bussed but is a much better seat. One is in the corner meaning one persons view is of the wall. Ask for the former. Again, willing to wait. She comes back and tells me \"that table is already spoken for\". Guess they spoke for it more than a week ago since I had the reservation and noone waiting for a table was ahead of us but tired of waiting. And I'll go ahead and add now that that table sat empty for over 30 minutes so I guess the hostess decided we weren't good enough for that table?   Waiter comes and is very nice, offers suggestions and we order drinks and food. Food comes about 15 minutes later and is wrong. WE NEVER SAW THE WAITER AGAIN! My boyfriend went ahead and ate his food b/c it was getting cold. But that waiter never came back. Some waitress started helping us when we HAD ALREADY FINISHED EATING, pretty much 20 minutes and 2 empty drinks later. I am literally making eye contact with our waiter and he never came back.   SOOOO... waitstaff is great -if you can find them, and food was really good-not what we ordered but we liked it. Overall service was so bad it isn't worth it.

I was full from eating Vegas buffets two days in a row so I wanted something lighter and cheaper. First off, nothing at Tableau is cheap. Secondly, I was also looking for quality, and every Wynn restaurant I've ever eaten at is first rate. (I've been to Red 8, Wing Lei, and Okada.) In terms of quality food and service, you can never go wrong with eating at a Wynn restaurant. That also explains why it's very expensive. If you want the best quality dishes and don't mind the price, then this is the place.\nTableau reminds me of a European-style French caf\u00e9. They give you top-notch waiter service. When the hostess seats you, you should ask to be seated in the Conservatory because it's a beautiful venue. \nTableau serves breakfast and lunch. They also serve specialty dishes that you won't find at buffets or American chain restaurants. Instead of picking the traditional American breakfast, I decided to try something special. I ordered one fresh oyster. It was small but delicious. I also ordered the Ahi Tuna dish which was served medium rare. The dish looked like it came from a master chef cooking competition. The dish wasn't that filling but at least it was delicious. Tableau also serves you bread which is free of charge. It was a very nice way to complement a meal. All the breads and parmesan crackers were delicious too.\nThis place is very fancy. Only go here if you have money to burn. Then you won't be disappointed."

Lots of meat, and a great hollandaise sauce that's oozing with goodness. \n\nAs with all places Wynn, a bit on the expensive side. But you also pay for the luxury to never leave your resort, and be confident you are not missing much outside by roaming the strip for food. That's an oxymoron in and of itself. \n\nOur service was awesome, the waitstaff was amazing and looked happy to be there for us on Christmas Day!"

Tableau is pricey, but goes out of its way to justify it.\n\nThe assorted specialty juices are good.  The selection of breads and pastries are fine as well.  \n\nDisclaimer: I've only had the breakfast fare at Tableau.  The white chocolate and orange French toast is good.  An off menu pastrami and egg special was exceptional.  The only thing I was disappointed by was the Canadian bacon on the eggs Benedict which was a bit tough.  The portions are small.  No one is getting fat eating at Tableau.\n\nWhile it is possible to walk in, Tableau is popular so make a reservation.  The yelp reservation app works well and we were seated immediately when we used it.  The hostesses have had things running smoothly every time I've gone.\n\nIf the weather is nice, ask to dine on the patio.  Unless an overweight Eastern European middle aged man is sunning himself in a Speedo by the pool, it only adds to the experience.  If the fat man is sunning, focus on your table mate or the smiling wait staff."

Is it one of the nicest restaurants at the Wynn?  Sure.  It has a nice, quiet ambiance, very sophisticated, very quiet.  Will you see any obnoxious frat boys or wannabe Gordon Geckos there?  Nope.  Is it a nice place to take your wife on your anniversary?  Yup.  It's an elegant restaurant that will impress that special someone in your life.  But is the food memorable?  Not even close.\n\nOK, ok, I had the prime filet.  I've had better...SW @ the Wynn was obviously better too.  My buddy at the halibut....he enjoyed his meal, but again, nothing where he was talking about it the next work day.  My other friend had the 7-course chef's meal...but his opinion doesn't matter, since he's a fancy-schmancy dude who's been to Aqua, French Laundry, etc, etc.  Overall, we were pleased with the meal, but not impressed.\n\nLook, I'm not one of those freaks on After Hours with Daniel (go mojo channel), comparing foreplay to appetizers and orgasms to banana ice cream....even though I'm a big fan of banana-flavored anything, so I did enjoy their roasted banana ice cream.  I'm just a regular joe-schmoe who occasionally attempts to be fancy, who attempts to step up the dining sophistication level a bit.  And I don't go to Vegas for the dining......that's #4 or #5 on my TO-DO list.....but I do want to have good food while I'm there.\n\nThe Wynn restaurants are really interesting......it's almost like you'll always spend $390 for 3 people there....the bill almost always comes out to that.  Whether it's the SW, Country Club, Tableau, Okada (good sake), Wing Lei (with serious alcohol), or Corsa Cuccina (with serious wine), the bill always comes out to $390.  Kinda scary.\n\nLike most of the restaurants at the Wynn, it's over-rated and over-hyped.  3-star rating in my opinion, but some will add another 1 star because of the environment and the \"Wynn\" factor."

Having a friend who prefers a vegan diet brought me to search for Tableau. They serve breakfast and lunch only. They have separate menus for different types of allergens and another for vegan/vegetarian, so ask for them if they are a concern.\n\nWe ended having lunch at the bright and airy conservatory with pristine surroundings that was akin to stepping back in time --there was a sense of understated formality from the wait staff to the china to the ambiance. And the food --simple, sublime, scrumptious.\n\nWith the bread tray, chose the corn bread which I ate with big dabs of butter. The Pan roasted salmon burger with seasonal fries was just magical with their homemade ketchup, where the seeds from the tomatoes peeked with eagerness.  Eating for the most part gluten-free but not bound by it, I had to eat half of the burger bun, which was soft and delicate yet truly held its form.\n\nThe service was more reserved (coffee & cream was at the beginning and refilled towards the end) but not necessarily unwelcome. My vegan friend completely enjoyed her Oriccehette pasta dish. Couple that wonderful conversation and it really seemed that time passed by slowly. That beautiful meal. That beautiful experience."

We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled and they made sure our coffee was filled which was real nice.\n\nThe first order was museli. It was made with cinnamon and small strips of apples. You are served with milk, brown sugar, etc. The museli was soft and tasty. The aroma of the cinnamon was enticing. We enjoyed the museli quite a bit.\n\nWe ordered the lemon ricotta pancake.....need I say more? It was gooood! If it was a short or full stack, we would have eaten it in a hot second. The hint of lemon was perfect and the ricotta added a very nice texture to the pancake. It was served warm and moist. We didn't even use the butter or the maple syrup.  \n\nNext order was their benie! They make their benies 3 ways and we chose the most basic one. It had cured ham, poached egg, and a nice sauce to which we requested be put on the side. I still enjoy Mon Ami Gabi's benie more but Tableau was good.\n\nOverall, Tableau was a good surprise.

Well, I don't see an additional page at the end of the menu, and I'm not sure what else you'd consider a duck entree (not to mention that both plates were ordered from the entree section).

Came in after a long night of debauchery and was immediately accommodated even without a reservation.  I, however, highly recommend making one since there were already plenty of people waiting only an hour after opening.\n\nBeing situated inside the Wynn, this isn't your typical run of the mill breakfast joint.  The restaurant itself was nicely decorated with elaborate features throughout.  If available, request for the conservatory which boasts great lighting and awesome views of the outdoor pool.  They also have patio seats that's ideal for good weather conditions.  One aspect I particularly didn't like was how the crowd was too hoity-toity which somewhat ruined the ambiance.  Superb customer service though with remarkable attention to details such as offering small chairs for purses which we found quite hilarious.\n\nInstead of ordering something off the menu that I can't easily get elsewhere, the inebriated part of me opted for the Tableau breakfast.  Indeed, that's as basic as anyone can get but it does come with complimentary beverage and pastry basket.\n\nOverall, Tableau is one of the better choices for breakfast around the Strip.  Yet, nothing really stood out of this place that makes me want to rate this place anything higher than three stars.  Perhaps we'll give it another try and definitely will be laying off the booze before heading here next time!"

It seriously feels like a setting for a tea party from a fairy tale (in a good way).\n\nWe split a tuna tartare appetizer, while I had the Duck Croque Madame and my girlfriend had the Pastrami and Eggs.  \n\nThe tuna tartare was some of the best I've ever had, and the portions were more than generous.  The duck croque madame is certainly my new favorite breakfast food (and possibly favorite food of any kind).  The pastrami and eggs were good also, but overshadowed by my dish.\n\nThrow in a couple coffees, and the bill still came to be less than a hundred bucks.  An absolutely astounding meal at a very reasonable price.  This was possibly the highlight of my entire time at the Wynn."

My boyfriend, who doesn't gamble or party, for that matter, is dying to get back to Vegas just to go back here.\n\nOn our first visit, we got the normal eggs benedict and lemon ricotta pancakes.  The second time we got the crab cake benedict and the same pancake.  All of the above was fantastic.  It doesn't look like a ton of food, but we felt very full after both meals.  ALSO, I'm a pescatarian, so we requested the filet mingon from the crab cake benedict on the side for one of them.  They didn't act like this was weird, which was nice.\n\nThe service was fantastic both days.  We were obviously not the typical Wynn-clientele, but they still treated us very well.  I even got a little purse chair for my frumpy messenger bag!\n\nThe ambiance in the restaurant was extremely pleasant.  Both times we ate indoors, but in their window area.  There is some outdoor seating and indoor seating with no sunlight.  \n\nIt is, as are most restaurants in Vegas, pricey.  I feel like if you plan your meals well in Vegas, you can splurge on something like this every once in a while."

It's become a Vegas tradition to grab brunch at Tableau on Sunday morning before leaving town -- brunch here is perhaps what I look forward to most, and is one of the few mandatory stops on the Vegas itinerary. \n\nWhat particularly stands out is the exemplary service -- the careful attention to detail throughout Wynn's properties finds no exception here. The staff addresses you by name and has a uncanny knack for making you feel as if you're their sole customer.\n\nWe order the Tableau Breakfast, which includes the pastry basket -- an assortment of freshly-baked pastries and jams that rival (or surpass) those found at any fine-dining establishment. The meal is filling and delicious and leaves nothing left to be desired. Coffee served is from Intelligentsia (perhaps the best coffee-roaster in LA). \n\nThe atmosphere is unique in that you feel just as comfortable in boat shoes and a polo than in swim-trunks and a t-shirt. The tables are white-linen clad, and the space is beautiful and airy, with large windows that face the VIP pool to the east. The walk to the bathroom, through the marble-clad, tower suites lobby, takes you past several, rotating pieces of art from Mr. Wynn's private collection. I spotted a Picasso (authentic) just outside the men's room door. In fact the dining room's decor always reminded me of Picacco's, post 30's, expressionist works  -- not a coincidence, I'm starting to believe. \n\nTableau (and The Wynn) is a respite from a town that can otherwise be tacky, over-priced and sub-par. I greatly enjoy spending time here and look forward to visiting for years to come."

It's the Wynn so of course it's nicely decorated, with a bright airy feel, nice artwork and both indoor and outdoor seating. A special touch are the little stools they provide for you to set your designer handbag. No joke, I posted a photo.\n\nI made a reservation for brunch, but that didn't seem to do much good since we still waited 20 minutes for a table. Despite this annoyance, we enjoyed our food and our server was very pleasant, so Tableau still  warrants 4 stars. \n\nMany Yelper's posted pictures of peach pancakes, but they didn't have this on the menu. Instead, we ordered the Orange and White Chocolate French Toast, delicious. \n\nI read somewhere that Steve Wynn is now Vegan and for this reason all of the restaurants at Wynn and Encore have to have a Vegan/Vegetarian menu. I'm not Vegan/Vegetarian but I do enjoy that cuisine, so I asked to see this menu and I posted a picture of it.\n\nI was torn on what else to order in addition to the French Toast. On the vegetarian menu there was an Eggs Benedict with a yellow tomato hollandaise sauce that really interested me. I'm not a fan of traditional hollandaise due to its heavy creaminess, but I also wanted real meat, not the fake sausage that came with the Veggie Benedict. So I asked our server if I could order the regular Eggs Benedict but substitute the yellow tomato hollandaise. She was happy to comply with my special request and my entree came out exactly how I wanted it. \n\nAnother special item was their house-made ketchup. It still had seeds from the tomatoes and it was lighter in texture and taste than bottled ketchup.\n\nIf you want a nice brunch in Vegas that avoids the gluttony of the buffets then give Tableau a try."

I had made reservations at 10 AM and got there at 10 AM on the dot.  Despite having reservations, we were still not seated until 10:30-definitely a negative.  I was also super excited to try out the vegan menu, however was surprised by the lack of options.  I was expecting it to be a bit more extensive.  We split the apple pancakes, frittata, and peach smoothie amongst the three of us in my party.  We also got a flight of juices, which were 3 mini shots of the various kind of juices they make.  Tiny amount considering the hefty price tag.  They gave us these mini cinnamon donuts at the beginning, which was actually probably my favorite part of the meal.  The frittata was mediocre for sure, however the pancakes were delicious.  \n\nThe main pro of this place is the beautiful ambience.  Would love to sit outside on a sunny day.  Unfortunately this place was a bit pricey for the quality in my opinion.  Also, a bit frustrating having to wait despite having reservations, however once we were seated the service was great.

Filet was cooked perfectly, combination of filet and crab with the eggs and english muffin was interesting but worked well. $27\n-Coffee- ok over priced large coffee for $14.\n-Orange ginger zest- great fresh squeezed juice. A bit pricy at $10 for a small.\n\nThe second morning, we had\n-Tableau breakfast- two stars at best - comes with scramble eggs, chicken apple sausages, one potato(delicious but tiny), pastry and coffee. It was kinda disappointing. Nothing special for $23. \n-Peach pancakes- two stars at best - 3 small pancakes with peaches on top. Nothing else and nothing special except the very high price for three pancakes: $17\n-Orange ginger zest again $10\nWe really liked the food there. It's a bit pricy but we are at the Wynn so I guess that's the Wynn price."
