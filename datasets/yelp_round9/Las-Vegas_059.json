But yes u try the shrimp fritter that was so good I actually never had something like that it's like my new favorite dim sum item! I also had chicken feet which my daughter loved and spare ribs and shrimp roll and the fried dough wrap with that steam roll thing lol I would come here again! So that means its worth a try!"

            "review": "Went on a Monday morning right at opening time with a party of 8, none of us Chinese nor fluent in figuring out what things are on the carts. I've had dim sum in San Francisco and Toronto; this visit, this day, PPP was almost on par. Almost everything was delicious. We had several different dumplings, some buns and several selections from the menu as well. One standout (again, I apologize for not knowing names) was a shrimp dumpling that had a creamy, slightly sweet filling that almost \"burst\" in the mouth, and was served with candied walnuts. Oh. My. That was so good. Other dishes featuring pork, beef and chicken were fantastic.\n\nTotal bill including tax and tip for 8 people and a ton of dim sum and 5-6 menu dishes: $200. An absolute steal. If I could go 4.5 stars, I'd do so. Ping Pang Pong is a winner."

I really dislike that as you have to make way thru all the smokers inside. Also, sitting near the outside of the restaurant is awkward because the ppl gambling and walking by just stare at your food. Other than that, it's a decent place for dim sum in Vegas."

This is a place that any dim sum fan should try at least once.\n\nI haven't tried their regular menu items, but I've heard great things. I intend on checking this place out for dinner so I can see for myself."

            "review": "Coming from Los Angeles, I'm completely spoiled with awesome dim sum places, so maybe you should take my review with a grain of salt. \n\nFirst off, the seating procedure is absolutely terrible. You wait in a line with a bunch of other people, whose parties can range from a small group of two to a large group of eight. Yet no one comes to sort out these groups and so because that group of eight is going to wait forever, you're waiting forever with them. \n\nWhen you're finally seated, you notice that there are two different rooms. If you're lucky, you'll be in the room near the kitchen, and you'll get your food. If not, you'll be waiting forever only to realize that those ladies with the carts are only going around the first room. \n\nHowever, I will say that their food is pretty good. Of all the dim sum I've tried in Vegas, this is probably the best one. They have a pretty good selection of dim sum, although I would say that their tripe is not that great. But I do really like their other dishes.\n\nAll in all, a good place for the food but you're going to have to suffer through the terrible service."

I would suggested get there early or you will have to wait in line and once they starts to get busy the waiters will forget about you. Such as refilled your water and clearing out  your empty dishes. Dim sum was good like any other dim sum place nothing to \"wow\"about. I guess it was Weekday so not too much choices on the dishes. The thing that brother us is, the restaurant is next to the casino floor and all the smoke were coming through the opening, sitting in the back will help a little.\n\nWe went back to get to go the next day, since it's across from out hotel. This time I was not impressed with the manager. After I had order we were sitting at an empty table near the door, the manager saw us and ask that we wait outside the door( which is the casino floor where the smoke is heavy.) and come back in 15-20 minutes to see if the Dim sum were ready. After 10 minutes I saw some people that were behind us whom also order to go were leaving with bags. So, I went back in and waited by the door. This time the manager told me to go to the lady at an counter, he said this is where you wait for your to go's. (This time his tone of voice was not friendly) I was upset by this, he should of told me that the first time instead of sending me out in the smoky room. \n\nI would not suggests this place, bad customer service from the manager and 2nd hand smoking coming from the casino floor not good for the children."

            "review": "We came by for dinner in this restaurant that was advertised at some point as the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas.  It's located in the older Gold Coast Casino, is a bit rundown but with authentic and low priced servings.  We had a nice beef satay with pineapples and enoki mushrooms (more Hawaiian than traditional Cantonese).  We also had a disappointing clay pot with ginger mushroom chicken.  The rice was flavorful, but there was no ginger, barely any mushrooms, and a lot of bony chicken scraps.  You can also have a Heineken here for $3.50.  Overall, ok for the price, but I suspect it can probably be a better place than what we experienced.   Service was also a bit poor, with no water refills, and it took a while for the rice pot to appear."

Got sat quickly and it took them about 15 minutes to ask what we wanted to drink, at the same we said we were ready to order and the person just walks away and another 15 - 20 minute wait on just order. So the order is put in for roast duck, fried rice and walnut shrimp. We start eating and drinking our sodas and no one comes by with refills so at this point I just want to eat and leave but nope. They just walk by and don't acknowledge us at all. So I had to get up and pay for the meal at the front desk and tell them straight up I'm not tipping them. The girl at the counter just looks and me and doesn't say anything at all. I will not be dining there at all in the future until they know how to treat their customers. I wasn't the only unhappy person either another table was pissed they couldn't order either. I hope they don't expect people to go back just because of the food. Order to go or something if you really want to eat there."

Of all the things we ordered the only thing i can call an Epic Fail were the deep fried shrimp balls with crab claw it was very bland and tasteless even for a deep fried dish.\n\nThe steamed buns are fresh and very soft and hot but the filling was bland and tasteless if it wasn't for the color i wouldn't have known it was suppose to be Chinese bbq pork.\n\nI will definitely come back on a weekend to see what their A team can offer but for now it's a step above the other place i said was epic garbage"

Seating sucked (if you're right at the entrance)\n\nNot a lot of dim sum selection at all either. All the carts that came around were the same thing that passed us earlier. So a lot of the food I normally eat, they don't have. \n\nTheir portion is smaller as well. As in, most places give you 3 egg tarts and this place gives you 2. Same for other dishes like the rice wrapped with leaves. \n\nCompared to DJ Dim Sum in Rio, this place has a major thumbs down in food and in service for sure. Don't think I'll ever come back."

Had never heard about this spot that lies within a local casino but was intrigued. Nestled inside the Gold Coast Casino, this restaurant seemed extremely popular, after about an hour wait we were finally seated. \n\nThe carts came around fairly quickly, so we were able to eat right away. The food itself was pretty standard and comparable to any other dim sum restaurant. However, my favorite item bolo bao was definitely not the same and I was unfortunately dissapointed. It was only bread with no custard filling and the custard baked on top was extremely hard. \n\nService was prompt and though there was a bit of a communication barrier, they were polite and willing to help figure out what we needed/wanted. \n\nPrice was decent and actually considering all the food we got it wasn't as expensive as I was expecting. Overall, I wouldnt be against going back."

The servers with the carts are quite pushy, and you'll need to learn to say no and keep looking for what you want, but it's worth it. Also, there can be some serious language barriers at times, but if it looks good it probably is good and eventually you'll learn what everything is. I never miss this place when in Vegas and I suggest you don't either. Even if you don't have a car with you, it's worth the cab ride."

I looked on at gamblers with envy, at least they had the potential to get their money back. The glitzy massive billboards and numerous reviews that laud this place as one of the best Chinese food restaurants are misleading. Maybe that distinction was right in the past but I couldn't find anything that would qualify as \"best\".  I should've known with a name like Ping Pang Pong. \n\nThe problems began in the beginning. Once seated we were ignored for a good time and my sister had to get up and ask for drinks. The food that came was unmemorable and smelled odd, even for a Chinese restaurant. The Cantonese Princess Chicken was cold, bony, and slathered in oil. Our noodle dish was over seasoned with curry powder and had a pungent odor. It left my stomache feeling uneasy as I was driving home. The only food I liked was the sauteed Chinese brocolli and soup, unfortunately that's not enough to warrant a visit. Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming here especially when there are plenty of better options in the valley."

We asked about it after 10 minutes but the hosted told us we had to wait like everyone else. So all those who were a party of 1-4, ahead of us, were waiting for smaller tables that were all filled. So we waited patiently in the smoke filled casino. As we approached the front, there were two couples ahead of us and the host asked how many in your party? The both answered two and when she asked us we said, \"Seven.\" And she immediately waived us ahead of the two couples...After waiting 40 minutes they line jumped us? What? SMH!!! This is absurd!

Full of Asian families taking their time and enjoying themselves.\n\nAmbience - Clean, well lit and noisy like most Dim Sum places.  Open kitchen which is somewhat unusual and a good thing.\n\nPrice - Ordered 1 A item and 4 B items plus 2 Tsin Dao beers ($7) for a total lunch of $22.38.\n\nService - Funny start when they tried to make me take a menu (I'm only part asian so I guess they wanted to make me order ala carte food).  After that it was good.  The hostess seated me right away and the food carts rotate quickly and consistently.  I hardly finished each plate and it was whisked away.  Busboy offered me a second beverage before I had to ask anyone for another.\n\nFood - Excellent selection sorted by food types: baked and fried goods, steamed goods, large sides (like fried rice), dessert and fresh beverage.\n\nPork Shui Mai - Good flavor but slightly chewy (like a typical chicken texture).\n\nBBQ Pork Bun Baked (Char Sui Bao) - Perfect bun texture and flavor with a tasty glaze coating (your hands will get sticky).  Stuffing of bbq pork was tasty.\n\nPork Dumpling (gau style not pot sticker) - Must have! great crispy dough contrasts with lightly chewy stuffing.  Lightly sweet flavor is delicate and delicious.\n\nChar Sui Bao steamed - Great flavor but dough wasn't my favorite (stick to the baked ones).\n\nShrimp dumpling (Har Gau) - Good sized value with sticky wrapper and delicately spiced shrimp filling.  Each one must have at least two 10-12 shrimps in it.\n\nDidn't try the fried rice, dessert cart or the fresh juice cart (soup or beverage?).  They also paraded around an asparagus plate that looked and smelled wonderful but I was too full.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the quality and value of this place and would recommend it.  I'm picky about Dim Sum and this place does a decent job on everything I tried and better than average with the Baked BBQ Pork Bun and Ha Gau."

About 4 or 5 years ago, my sister swore by this place for decent Chinese food. Now it has a lot of competition. So basically, I'm just reviewing their dim sum service.\n\nI had to explain to my husband the difference between AUTHENTIC Chinese food and Chinese food. I've learned that some (not all) that call Panda Express and PF Changs Chinese food may not like AUTHENTIC Chinese food. They are not one and the same.\n\nThere is a definite difference in quality compared to other favorite dim sum joints I've been too. PPP is hot & fresh and definitely tasty. I must emphasize HOT because that's the biggest blow for dim sum lovers - cold food! I wouldn't recommend it for 1st time dim summers though unless you speak fluent Chinese. I'm half Asian and can decipher a lot of broken English, but I've had a very difficult time figuring out what the cart ladies say is on their cart. My husband and I are not as adventurous, so we are the types that want to know what we are eating before we eat it....\n\nBut once you can identify a food by looking at it, PPP is definitely on the higher end of the spectrum for taste and quality. Their shrimp dumplings for example - are probably the best I've had and when you think about a simple dumpling is made - you have to admire that somewhere in the process, PPP does something spectacular.\n\nThe shrimp balls, shumai, pork buns, sticky pork buns - all have a little extra something that sets them above the rest.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quaint. You can see the kitchen from your table, and the a lot of what, in most places, is normally behind closed doors. Goldcoast is not the most glamorous of casinos... and the restaurant itself is still a good ways from the parking garage. But if you don't mind walking through the casino and the smoke that comes with it, the location may work for you. \n\nPlus, if you are a dim sum for breakfast person like me, they do open a bit earlier than a lot places around town 10:00am.\n\nSo if you enjoy dim sum, PPP is definitely a must-have on you're list. You just have to, even if it's once."

The service was good and the carts are constantly circulating so there's no shortage of food when you're ready to order more. I will try the dinner menu next time I'm at the Gold Coast but I will go elsewhere for dim sum."

Fried rice with beef, tomatoes, bean sprouts and Thai chilies. It's been in some of the Vegas weekly magazines as some of the best fried rice in Vegas and well I haven't tried all of them but it's is pretty damn good. I also love their Moo Sho Chicken. I didn't even want to share. The walnut prawns are pretty good too. If you're noise sensitive you definitely don't want to come the noise level I pretty intense. I will have to come back and try the dim sum and see what it's all about."

I ordered the Gabo beef and beef chow fun for ~27.\n\n- Gabo beef was very delicious Although the portion seemed small, it was very fulfilling. the meat even appeared dry, but turned out to be juicy. It was tender and quite flavorful. \n- Beef chow fun was pretty good and the portion was generous. Kind of unremarkable. Not too oily. No real unique taste.\n- Free hot tea :)\n- Fast service. Quick with refills.\n- If you see a lot of old asian grand ma's and pop's, then you know its legit! lol\n- It's pleasant enough for me to come back and try their dim sum. \n- For dinner, I'd opt for wendy's noodle cafe.\n\n:)!"

However, this lack of hostility does not take away from the food being fantastic. All of the servers are very friendly and eager to explain all of the dishes on their carts. Also the servers do speak English very well and also speak at least one dialect of Chinese. \n\nI would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is curious to learn more about Chinese culture, cuisine, and the world of dim sum."

The price is a little bit high for typical dim sum place but understandable since they are inside a hotel/casino. The only thing i didn't like it was the location was way back inside the casino and it was a bit hard to find.\n\nI would give the food 4.5 because we really enjoyed the dim sum and the Gobo beef is very very good.

            "review": "Came here with a friend for a dim sum lunch late Monday morning, and it was already packed with a short line of customers waiting.  The wait was about 15 minutes before we were seated at a table.\n\nService here is decent, with about 4 to 5 carts of dim sum items to choose from.  Selection was good, but the quality of the dim sum is both good and bad.  Good is good, not great, as the dishes we enjoyed didn't wow us tremendously.  The bad dishes, unfortunately, left a lasting impression.  The included the following:\n\n- Roast Pork - Though the skin was rather crispy, you can tell by the color and texture of the meat that it was reaheated.  It was not fresh despite the fact the cart lady chimed that the roast pork just came out of the oven/fire.\n\n- Siu Mai - These steamed dumplings are traditionally made with seasoned ground pork, shitake mushrooms and shrimp.  There was no shrimp in these, and some of the siu mais were prepared in the way where a couple of them were dense, dry and hard to the chew.  \n\n- Chinese Broccoli - The dish we got had broccoli that was not as thick as the ones on the other dish.  Chinese Broccoli, as it grows older, the stalks get thicker and the inside turns from translucent (tender) to white (old).  We needed some greens to balance the meal and tried this.  Aside from the issue with the age of the broccoli used, the preparation was fine.  But older broccoli is harder to chew through and can be awfully fibrous.\n\n- XO Sauce Pan-Fried Rice Noodle Rolls - Seasoned well, but could have used more XO Sauce to give it a spicy kick.  The problem with the dish we got was that it was the last of it's type on a cart, uncovered, and must have sat on that cart for awhile.  It was cold, not as flavorful, and cold rice noodles dry up and harden.  Best to ask to test the temperature of the plate or dish these more exotic dim sum dishes are served on so that you can figure out if it's relatively fresh, or if it's been sitting around for a while.\n\nPrices are higher, as expected, since this is a hotel restaurant.  With other dim sum palaces in Vegas, we probably won't be back.  It's OK to good, but there are better."

The porridge was okay - it was actually kind of bland and I wish I had salt. The Wonton soup was not any better - the noodles were stuck together and the wonton was also very bland. \n\nSo even after trying the food here and knowing its not that good- why would I come back again? Well my dad didn't think it was so bad so the next day he wanted to order the same thing - I really didn't want to but he insisted he wanted to eat porridge - so this time we went to order it for take out again.\n\nThis time I experienced the service -- and it was ridiculous - took 45 minutes for two dishes...on top of that the waitress was very unfriendly. The chef didn't even remember to make the porridge until I asked the waitress three times after 30 minutes - and she finally asked the chef - which was just standing around - to make it. It took him less than 5 minutes to make it but I waited 45 minutes for it. Then after that I asked her for an extra spoon and she didn't even want to give it. On top\n\nDefinitely not a place I want to go back to. Both the food I tried and the service I experienced was pretty bad. On top of that they were pretty expensive."

I suppose it's the best dim sum in Las Vegas but places in Arizona have impressed me more.

We tried a wide variety of dishes and the salt water dumpling, egg tarts, and the chicken feet were the only ones that were particularly good.  Salt water dumpling is always good because they're fried, the egg tart is generous with custard filling, and the chicken feet had a good sauce on them.  Plus, they were really plump!  I did find the roe on the siu mai and other various dumplings to be interesting.  They didn't add much the dish themselves but it was okay.\n\nService is that of all dim sum places: basic.

We got a spicy snail dish only because we saw it and asked about it. It was nice if you're okay with chewy snails, but it being on our table also encouraged some servers to offer us stuff on their second pass that wasn't offered the first time round. \n\nIt was pretty cheap based on my experiences in LA.

I just don't remember if they had my favorite chili paste Sambal Oelek there or not, they may might have had the regular chili oil, which IMO is not the freaking same!  (So if any Asian restaurant owners/managers are reading this please read carefully....Sambal Oelek chili paste can not be substituted with chili oil or any other brand!  Damnamit.)  \n\nAlthough....one thing that I did enjoy over here specifically was their jellyfish during dim sum hours.  Idk, either the places I go to don't offer jellyfish at dim sum or I just barely missed the very last portion to some lucky sonofabitch.  :/  Other than the jellyfish, their name 'Ping Pang Pong' and that its in Vegas... nothing really stands out to me as I can have the same at any one of the numerous dim sum restaurants in Cali.  Nice place to check out nonetheless if you suddenly have a craving attack for dim sum and the 'Asian' foods at the buffets aren't satiating that craving."

If you find yourself staying at the Rio or Palms, it is a worthwhile walk. It's worth a drive from anywhere else.\n\nI went there twice on my last trip to Vegas. The first time I got jellyfish and calamari with veggies in a hot sauce (a chef's special). I admit I was drawn to it for its \"weirdness,\" but also to prove to myself that it doesn't matter what you order. If you have an open mind, this place is a foodie adventure. Anyway, this dish was great. I started with the squab and pork lettuce cups, which were a little heavy on the lettuce, but they really didn't skimp on the meat either. Perfect amount of salt and tangy. Again, really good.\n\nMy second night there I had the Cantonese sausage fried rice and lamb tenderloin (more along the lines of what I would usually order) and it was very flavorful. Across the board, they do a great job with balancing flavors - hot and sweet, and a little hint of ginger when you are not expecting it. \n\nAlso, you gotta love $3.50 Tsing Tao beer...\n\nService is a little spotty, but I was dining alone and checking email/Facebook in the gaps, so I got by alright.\n\nI highly recommend this place. Especially if your idea of Chinese food is that it should come out of a cardboard box. This is the kind of place that proves this cuisine can be as good as any other in a sit down restaurant setting."

LOL It's tough to make it bad, but it happens quite a bit.  Whatever chinatown you go to, usually the crowded dimsum places are the best and having to wait in a line in vegas for dimsum meant Ping Pang Pong was decent and it was.

We also had oolong tea and water. \n\nThe only thing I was Totally, Totally amazed with was the quickness of us receiving our food!!! It was like minutes of ordering and open & close your eyes they appeared!!! Am I dreaming or what? No it actually happened and I saw it happened at several other tables surrounding us too.\n\nMy favorite entree was the gobo beef. I wished I ordered several of those as I could have had the entire plate to myself! I will definitely remember that for next time:)\n\nThis restaurant was closed between 3-5 pm so we had waited for a minimum of an hour for it to open. There was a huge line for both the to-go line and waiting to be served line for the restaurant prior to 5 pm.  They didn't have a special NYE up-charged menu which was nice unlike many others restaurants who did especially for NYE night. That's probably why they did so well that evening as they were extremely BUSY!!! Despite that fact the food still came out in record time.\n\nI have to admit the food was quite tasty. Maybe a slight difference in taste but not bad though that I would knock down in stars.

Could've been worse like Ching Chang Chong. Yikes!\n\nMy friend and I woke up late, came here after a craving for dimsum around 12. We were actually happy to find that there IS a place in Vegas that serves Dimsum!!! WOOHOO! BUT OH MY GOODNESS.. THE WAIT! I can't believe we actually stuck around for an hour for a table at this place. I guess we were really desperate for dimsum. Everything we tried here was delicious!! Except for their crispy shrimp balls.\n\n2 Orders Siu Mai - YUM\n2 Orders Har Gow - YUM!\nChinese Broccoli (they put the oyster sauce on the side) - YUM! \nTaro Dumping - YUM!\nLong Noodle Roll - YUM! I wish they would've put more sauce on it though.\nCrispy Shrimp Balls - Mehhh.. They were tiny and covered with sliced almonds? instead of crispy noodles. :( Not worth it, and didn't come with sweet and sour sauce.  \n\nI'm not sure if that's all we've ordered but it was definitely delicious! Came out to $32 bucks excluding tip! Good for two people! But the wait was horrendous!\n\nI wanted to come here again before my flight in the morning but they only serve dimsum daily from 10am-3pm BOOO!!!!!"

Getting in is the hard part-- you stand in line with a crowd of people yelling in various Chinese dialects as they shove, cut, and complain-- all adding authenticity and closely matching my experiences in China.  Another reason for the long wait is, once inside, diners tend to linger. I don't blame them. The food is tasty, hot, and well-varied. All my favorite dim sum dishes were here.  Servers are friendly and I never felt ignored (as I have at other dim sum places).  For about $18 including tip I was able to stuff myself.\n\n  The 40 minute wait to get in was painful but I'm glad I stuck around."

LOVE their dim sum, it's all I've ever had there so I can not comment on their Chinese Food.  I can tell you though that 98% of their customers are Asian and so that is a huge indicator of the level of authenticity.  In the past we had trouble communicating with the staff because they usually speak in their own language, this last time though it seems they have hired more English speaking staff and it was considerably easier to order.\n\nEveryone is smiley and happy, the worst part is getting seated.  There is ALWAYS  a wait, I don't care what time or day you go, but once you get seated being it's dim sum there is no wait for food and it just keeps rolling past you for your pleasure.  I love everything we have ever had there and they are reasonable with their cost.\n\nThe worst part of this place is that it is located in the Gold Coast and you have to wade through the heavily smoked environment to get to the restaurant, but even going through that is worth it for this place."

They have a separate line for to go orders which was really convenient and dinner rush hasn't started yet so it wasn't as crazy as expected, though there were a lot of people dining in already. \n\nTheir dim sum list isn't quite as large as some of the others in town so we tried all of them, some double orders. Each order was $3.88 if I recall correctly. Everything that we tried I liked, a lot! Their shumai and  Har gow shrimp dumpling was delicious, so was the shrimp with chives. The pork bun was one of the best I've had in town. They also had this bun that had lap cheong (Chinese sausage) inside which was very savory and mouth watering. For dessert we got sesame balls, coconut buns and mango pudding, all 3 were great. Their fried rice had great flavors but I didn't like the use of jasmine rice.

If you arrive early, be patient & wait about 20 minutes til the dishes really start coming out. If not, then show up about 30 minutes after they open, just be prepared to wait.\nThe challenge? Their Servers are all Chinese, which is great, however with all of the noise, hearing them through the noise & their accents was a challenge.\nDefinitely a go to spot from now on!"

I figured this meant that a continuous stream of people kept coming in - & that that's maybe because the food is good. The things I learn from watching Sherlock.\n\nTIP: How do you skip the super long line at Ping Pang Pong? No, this isn't that non-PC joke\n\nIf you spot a big empty table that will seat you/your group & the people in front of/behind you, consider befriending them, at least temporarily, for the purpose of sharing the table. That's what we did. There were 3 of us, 2 of them, & a few empty seats separating us from them. Otherwise, we would've had to wait another 30 minutes to an hour."

It was absolutely delicious and very authentic. I've been eating at some of the great Dim Sum houses in Alhambra (East of Downtown LA) and surrounds for years and years and was quite surprised and pleased that PPP was able to serve up Dim Sum that was on par with some of the greats like Ocean Star and NBC (Both on Atlantic Blvd. Alhambra...Don't miss 'em). \n\nPing Pang Pong serves a wide variety of Dim Sum and the carts filled with the steaming treats are plentiful. The prices are similar to places in Alhambra & Los Angeles, however, instead of placing four of something on a plate, they put three. Nonetheless, the food is terrific. Lunch for three very satisfied people was about $10-$12 per person...and we were stuffed. Bravo on Dim Sum PPP.\n\nNow the downside to the story...\n\nMy second trip to the restaurant was for dinner. We ordered Hot & Sour Soup, Pineapple Beef, Seafood Noodles, and Squab in Lettuce Cups. Overall a great disappointment. \n\nThe Hot & Sour soup was the best dish we ordered, so we started off the meal well. The Squab in Lettuce Cups were good, but not great...and a bit on the chintzy side. Because there were four of us, we were required to order two additional pieces of lettuce at $1 apiece. Come on...two extra dollars for two tiny pieces of lettuce? The Pineapple Beef had absolutely NO FLAVOR. It was terrible actually. I don't even think they put salt in it it was that tasteless. The pineapple chunks were straight out of a can...and the can was probably from the 99 Cent store. Just plain bad. The Noodles were about average from any Chinese restaurant. \n\nTowards the end of the meal I felt like I would only come back to this place for Dim Sum but some of my dinner companions disagreed. We did see dishes that looked really savory and tempting being served to other tables. The Walnut Glazed Shrimp looked amazing!  \n\nThe overall consensus was that we may have just ordered a couple of dishes that were lackluster and that Ping Pang Pong is worthy of another dinner experience. Their Dim Sum is first rate so I know they know how to cook."

What the f***?!\n\nEntrees we ordered:\n\nSeafood porridge - I asked them to add the preserved egg, which I had been craving. Well, the porridge was bland and I had to keep adding soy sauce to make it better. The preserved egg tasted funky, not at all like what I was used to in LA's Chinatown.\nGobo beef - EW. They were basically big cubes of beef (bigger than bite size, so it was a little hard chewing on them)  that seemed to have been boiled in soy sauce. They also seemed a little bloody.\nSalt and pepper pork chops - They were pretty standard. A little bit dry.\nHot braised chicken - This was the only semi-decent dish. But it was basically sweet and sour chicken. \nShrimp fried rice - This one arrived to the table first, a good 20 minutes before the actual entrees arrived. So it was cold by the time we started eating. Not good.\n\nI didn't try their dimsum; if that's what I wanted, I could've just gone to Chinatown. But this is definitely not a good dinner spot."

You can use comps. or points to pay, since most of my families gamble at Gold Coast casino. \nIt has decent dim sum. When I got to the restaurant I ordered the sweet tofu. Normally I wouldn't order this but I wanted to try something different. I was surprised by the quality of the food and how well it was prepared. It has to be one of the better desserts I've had in awhile. I highly recommend trying the sweet tofu, especially because they're using real honey to garnished the dish. Overall, the service was exceptional, and the waitstaff was there to help us right away with no waiting around. I highly recommend this restaurant if you plan on eating in a casino. Surprisingly, their food quality is above-average, which is very eye-opening considering the location."

I looked at the cooks to notice none of them talking, they were just busting out the food. The server checked on us once and then asked if we wanted to go boxes.

Every single time we eat here there is always a long waiting line to just get seated. The food is average for a dim sum place. The only reason I go here is because I have comps to use up before they expire. After waiting about 15-30 minutes to be seated, we wait again for about 10 minutes before a waiter/waitress even shows up to take our drink order. Almost every time we sit at the table we are missing either silverware or tea cups. This place is always understaffed and could use more personnel to wait on the customers. The food is about average and once something runs out from the dim sum carts it takes over 30+ minutes to replenish that food item. This restaurant could definitely use a lot more improvements to service, training, and wait times."

I am not a fan of luke warm dim sum.  This is often a problem when a place isn't busy and things circulate for too long or when a place is too big and the carts have travel vast distances from kitchen to patron.  \n\nThey offer all of my faves like chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, baked char shiu bau (sp?), shrimp and chive nuggets, crab balls, chow fun, shiu mai (sp?).  OK, OK I admit I have absolutely no idea how to name or spell most of the hot tiny treasures but I love to eat them!  One complaint here at ping pang pong, is that they serve the oyster sauce on the side of the chinese broccoli....I must prefer a heart drizzle evenly over the top.  \n\nThey are friendlier than most but still the service is abrupt, semi-angry, and without any normal pleasantries.  This is to be expected from most Chinese establishments, especially dim sum.  But the attitude adds to the experience if you ask me!  \n\nIf it is your first crack at dim sum, this may be the best place to try it.  The ladies pushing the carts even explained what was in some of the items!  Revolutionary.  \n\nDim sum at ping pang pong is better than most here in town but not the best ever, but definitely worth a try!!!"

When my friend and I first got here (around 1130), we had to wait about 10-15 min before we could get some tea or even water to drink! It wasn't even that busy yet, and we were seated right away! Usually, at many dim sum places, it is automatic to get tea or water right away! Also, the carts did not come to our side very often, so we had to make sure to get plenty of things before we started really eating! (Especially the dessert cart! Geez! That one took forever to come by!).\n\nThe place is also pretty small. We can barely get into or out of our seats, since they were so close together (so I just stayed in mine the whole time without moving it heheh!). \n\nThe only thing that I tried here that was not as common as other dim sum places was their soft tofu dessert with sugar/ginger syrup. It tasted like a Filipino dessert called Ta-ho (except Ta-ho is sweeter and not ginger-tasting). That was pretty good. They also had a seaweed salad, (which looked very good but didn't come until we were waiting for our check), and we couldn't try it! Other than those two, just your typical dim sum place with a limited quantity of items!\n\nI probably would not go back here, especially if I ever have to wait! Geez...wait for a table...and then WAIT for a drink...and then WAIT for the dim sum...and even WAIT for our check/to go boxes! \n\nUnless you're with a big party, this place would probably be decent to have dim sum. Be ready to FLAG those cart people! Expect a wait on the weekends starting around 12 (We went on a Sunday). \n\nBtw, the price for most of the dim sum is about $3 a piece, so it could add up if you want to try lots of things...(They also charge for tea!)"

I've never been this upset at waiters and waitresses. They were rude and even when I explained I was just following what the other waitress had said, the guy and another waitress have me the look like I was trash and proceeded to make me feel even worse. Never coming back again. \n\nAs for the food, I came to try the shumai, the pork ones and har gow which are the shrimp dumplings after reading many good reviews and my friends telling me about this place. Aside from the service, the food itself was nothing outstanding. The taste was alright for the shrimp dumplings but for the shumai, it was like chewing malleable rubber. Each dumpling was like a small toy! I think that surprised me the most. For those who want to try dimsum and absolutely can't get any better, this place is okay, but for sure, there are much better options for me here in SoCal."

            "review": "PINGing with excitement, we were thrilled to try out some dim sum while in Vegas. We ate here with some friends that had lived in Vegas and said this was one of the best places for dim sum. We arrived here around noon, and there was a bit of a wait, since there is limited space in the restaurant, especially for large parties of more than 4. Ignoring our PANGs of hunger, we waited patiently. It probably took us about 20-30 minutes to get seated. \n\nWhile the selection is more limited than other dim sum restaurants, they do you have your standard dim sum items like shu mai, sticky rice in lotus leaf, fried taro cake, chicken feet, spare ribs, congee, and bao. \n\nThe items were hot, and fresh tasting. The carts went by at a decent rate, but we were warned that you should get any items you wanted while the cart was there, since you might not see that cart again. Prices were a bit high compared to other restaurants I've eaten at (3-4 dollars per item average), but that was to be expected for dim sum in a Vegas casino.\n\nService was a bit spotty, but to be expected since the restaurant was filled to capacity with hungry diners. Waiters were buzzing back and forth, like a ball in a PONG game, filling water, getting more tea, and getting people's checks.\n\nSo if you're hungry for dim sum, this restaurant is a good choice. If you are with a larger party though, it helps to come here before noon when it's less crowded."

            "review": "It's hard to believe, but the best dim sum in Las Vegas is NOT found in our burgeoning (and otherwise excellent) Chinatown district stretching along Spring Mountain Road. Instead, truly \"world-class\" dim sum is to be found in the Ping Pang Pong Restaurant in the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino.\n\nHonest.\n\nFrom your basic steamed buns & fried rice to more esoteric fare like chicken feet & jellyfish, Ping Pang Pong serves it all.\n\nSituated in the back of the western half of the Gold Coast, it nevertheless has built a reputation for authentic, tasty dim sum, so the lunch crowd is uniformly large. I recommend coming here when you have at least an hour to spend on your midday meal. Dim Sum may be Chinese fast food, but the price of Ping Pang Pong's excellence is crowds.\n\nA note on the authenticity of Ping Pang Pong's cuisine: On several visits, I have been the most caucasian customer seated, and I'm half-filipino. Which brings me to another point: none of the waitstaff here seems to have a firm handle on English, so, although the service has always been excellent, ordering always seems to involve lots of gestures and nodding.\n\nI have a kind of method to my own dim sum madness: I sit down, order some tea (or a beer), and wait for the carts to roll by. And, even if the dessert cart comes first, I start pointing to things that look good. One of my favorite desserts-as-appetizers are sesame balls filled with red bean paste. Another favorite appetizer: a steamed bun filled with a single, spicy Cantonese sausage. But I'm not finicky about what comes first. The point of a dim sum lunch is to enjoy as many different tastes as you can before you're completely topped off. Before long, I typically have as many as a dozen different dishes crowded onto my table.\n\n\nAs the helpful cart-pushers place each dish on your table, they mark your check with a stamp or a pen, indicating how many dishes you ordered & what \"class\" those dishes belong to. As far as I've been able to determine, the least expensive dishes run about 2 dollars while the most expensive run about 5 dollars. Because I am such a pig (ordering not only my favorites, but also anything I've never seen before), my bill is usually about 30 bucks, but you can have a nice, filling lunch for half of that.\n\nThe aforementioned jellyfish is light & vinegary, a little crunchy & slightly fishy, perfectly complemented with a splash of chili sauce, and I use it as a palette cleanser between courses. They also do a wonderful little bowl of sausage & egg fried rice. (One of the few dishes -- like the perfectly-fried chicken wings -- that my diehard midwestern Princess feels brave enough to eat.) Unlike most westerners, I am comfortable with the texture of gelatinous food, and Ping Pang Pong offers an incredible serving of spicy beef tendon, slow-cooked with onions and sprinkled with chili flakes.\n\nOther highlights include:\n\n* The rice-noodle rolls, where the gooey white noodles are wrapped around a filling like beef or a crunchy pastry and the whole thing gets bathed in a brothy sauce. The overall texture of the dish is a flavorful jelly filled with bits of chewiness -- again, not a combination one finds in the average American eatery.\n\n* The steamed-chicken & glutinous rice wrapped in a leaf, where the wrap (a lotus leaf? a banana leaf?) effectively stews the mixture of chicken & rice into soupy goodness that's best addressed with a spoon.\n\n* Char-siu ribs, the red spare-ribs that are sweet & chewy awesomeness. I go at these with my bare hands and generally leave the restaurant with a fair amount of the meat still stuck between my teeth.\n\n* Steamed meatballs, either ground beef or pork, mixed with some bits of veggie and wrapped with a thin skin of egg, these are stick-to-your-ribs meaty & delicately spongy, and they absolutely scream for generous dollops of chili sauce.\n\nI could go on, but you get the point. In a city that built the lowbrow end of its culinary reputation on the all-you-can-eat buffet, the dim sum lunch at Ping Pang Pong Restaurant offers a sublime alternative: a cornucopia of flavors at a very reasonable price. And the buffet rolls past your table, instead of you having to get up and walk to it. Talk about convenience.\n\nAnytime you feel like braving the wilds of the Gold Coast to get to dim sum heaven, I'd be happy to meet you there."

A heard of people came out of nowhere and after we were already standing behind a person, which I was there before they got there.  I still waited behind.  After the person had his order taken the cashier rudely had said she would not take our order that we had to wait behind the long line of people.  And I told her you seen me I was here before all these people even showed up.  Wow I bet if I was an older couple I bet she would have took our order anyway.   That is just poor customer service and lacking hospitality.  I will make sure I let everyone and anyone know that these people or at least the cashier who opened up the shift today on a Sunday evening is more of a reason for a food aficionado like me be pissed enough to bring my business and loyalty else where.

Not long after we were seated, our drink order was taken and then moments later our order.  The food is served family style and comes out when it's ready (which typically doesn't take long.)\n\nToday we ordered lobster ($70), Cantonese Princess Chicken ($14.95), XO green string beans add cod fish ($16.95 - they charge $3 for XO and $5 for the fish), spinach with fermented bean curd ($8.95), and live scallops ($8). \n\nThe lobster was delicious and fresh cooked hong kong style which is sauteed in a ginger scallion sauce chopped in pieces you can easily remove it's shell.  (Pic added) They don't charge by the pound which is weird.  They just charge one flat rate cost.  This lobster was a good two pounds.  Delicious.  Traditional Chinese restaurants will serve their food whole - meaning everything from the head to the tail.  It's considered bad luck to not serve it whole.\n\nThis whole chicken is served cold which throws people off.  My friends have told me they'd like it more if it was served hot.  It comes with dried scallops and a ginger and oil dipping sauce which I find myself dunking my chicken in and mixing it with rice.  Yum.\n\nThe green string beans is alone $8.25, but I love XO sauce and to add some fresh cod to it was a no-brainer.  This was cooked to perfection with the green beans crisp and the fish was fresh and delicate texture. (Pic added)\n\nThe spinach was low in flavor for me.  My folks liked it but they would eat spinach simply steamed.  The spinach itself was fresh, they just didn't add enough \"foo yee\" and when I asked for extra (pic added) and when I tried to mix it with the spinach something wasn't right.  It's unfortunate as you can't reheat spinach very well so the left overs were wasted.\n\nThe live scallop comes on a shell with rice noodles.  It's a small portion of two pieces for $8.  My mom likes it but I've had better.  They also have razor clams for $10 for 4 pieces cooked in black bean sauce.  I was first introduced this gem in Hong Kong and the flavor is close here but I shouldn't really compare it when they literally just pulled it out of the water hours ago in HK.\n\nOther items I would recommend is their ma po tofu, gobo beef, lamb with scallions, walnut prawns, and their singapore noodle but add extra curry.\n\nThey usually have a house soup they provide complimentary but they didn't today - or maybe we just didn't ask for it.\n\nSadly, if it wasn't that we come here so often and they know my parents, I think we wouldn't have such great service.  I feel for the people that have to keep flagging down their server or constantly have to ask for more tea or napkins.  I do believe the servers and busboys are trying - I think it's just engrained in our old school culture that this is the way it's suppose to be. sigh."

But while eating my noodles, one was chewy, I finally went to pull it out of my mouth, it was the EXACT same color as the noodles, and when I looked at what it was, it was a rubber band!!!

It's really hard to find a good place to eat dim sum in Vegas.\n\nBut whenever I want dim sum, this is the go-to place, don't even risk trying the other ones, cuz you might want your money back :p\n\nThis review is only for the dim sum dishes, cuz I don't eat noodles or other entrees when I go for dim sum :) The dim sums are pretty good, but they only have a limited selection, I like it more when there is more varieties. The other thing is that this place is inside a casino, and the only thing that goes between you and the casino floor is a fence, so you always smell people smoking or people looking, kind of awkward... Also, I hate that this place only sells Portuguese egg tart on weekends, where the hell is my Hong Kong style egg tart?!?!?!"

It is located inside the Gold Coast which is notorious for having this type of clientele. \n\nI am always the only caucasian person here but I don't care. I love ethnic food especially dim sum which I was not able to get back east unless I traveled to Boston's Chinatown. I did not do this at all. \n\nI always opt to sit at their dining island which over looks the action in the kitchen. It's like watching a show. Very entertaining. Always 3 cooks manning the hot woks and 2 guys pumping out different types of dim sum. I flag down the cart pushers and they stop. I have never tried any of the crazy stuff like chicken feet or squid. I know what I like and i go for it hard. \n\nI usually end up getting lo mai gai, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf. This is simple and good. Little bits of chinese sausage in the rice. I order the pan fried pot stickers which are juicy and hot. Shu mai are made with pork and shrimp. Har gow are shrimp dumplings. Shrimp and scallion cakes are pan fried. Bbq pork buns are fluffy.\n\nEverything is served small plate style perfect for sharing. And everything is very inexpensive. I think like $2.35 per dish. I have not tried anything off their full menu but i'm sure it delicious. Dim Sum is daily till 3:00pm I believe. But the rest of the menu is served after that and the restaurant is open till 3:00am.\n\nI think the dim sum is better quality and fresher here than at Orchid Gardens."

It barely qualifies as dim sum since the dining area is tiny, the only view is of slot machines, there are so few clients since it's so small that the food selection is nearly nil!!  Some of the food is brought on trays since there's barely room for the carts.\n\nI took my wife and in-laws who were born and raised in mainland China and they agree it's nothing special compared to Orchid Gardens although they did like the chicken feet and congee they ate.  I couldn't come up with enough dishes to even eat so we bailed out after a couple of dishes and ate at the buffet instead!!  My wife commented that even the hot sauce was the cheap kind.  None of my favorite \"ribs\" and no Chinese broccoli in sight.  Prices were nothing special and it had zero atmosphere.  All this in spite of the fact that we know one of the servers.  I hate to say it but the service was also marginal.\n\nAs an example of my dim sum credentials we checked out two dim sum spots in San Francisco the week before.  How about dim sum for four people including duck for all of $12.50?  This was at the Oriental Tea House in San Leandro.  Great place and not just because the food was cheap.\n\nGo to Orchid Gardens for dim sum.  Real atmosphere, great food selection and even friendly service!"

Every thing was served family-style and arrived fairly quickly.  The fried flounder and pea leaves are things they always order.  It does not have strong flavors, but when paired with the dipping sauce it certainly hits the spot for a good home-cooked meal.  The satay beef, however, was beyond greasy.

They used to have a larger variety and now they are lacking!  They don't even offer the Big F's favorite - the Macanese egg tart, which really puts a damper on things.

I thought it was because I get dumped at the corner table all the time, but I just think it sucks.  The last time we ate there (last month), we didn't even have all our dishes and serving utensils before the dim sum arrived.  It took awhile to wave down a waiter and get some tea.  We ordered a plate of Singapore noodles and that took forever to come out as well.  \n\nAnd it's so random when it's busy.  On one Saturday I went, there was no wait.  And then other times it's a good half an hour wait for a party of four.

At a typical dim sum place, you go up to a hostess, and you get a number, so I get ready to go up to the hostess, but there is a line blocked off in front of her. So I go and wait in line, the line does not move an inch for 20 minutes. So I think I must get a number and then stand in line. I approach the hostess again, and ask her politely in Cantonese, could I get a number for a table of 6. She proceeds to b*tch at me and say that I need to stand in line, so I start to walk away, and then she goes wait do you have a number, and I said no so she haughtily hands me the number. Completely un-phased, I ask how long would the wait be, she looks at me incredulously, like I am some sort of infant, and rudely tells me this place is very busy and there is no possible way for her to even approximate a wait and could I stand aside I was blocking her table. I hear people all around me asking the same question and everyone getting the same crappy answer to the point all, but two tables stayed to wait. Being a b*tch is inexcusable. I have eaten dim sum in Hong Kong where people get up and line up in front of the carts for dim sum and its the way it is over there. This place seemed to be conflicted whether or not it wanted to be a free-for-all or a place that carefully lines up and due to this confusion, NO ONE was getting served."

It was on a dish meant for everyone to eat off of. I tried my family's dishes as well as the dim sum they ordered and it was delicious.

Din Tai Fung was probably the closest (is that even considered dim sum?), but in the more typical joints where they come around with the trays, I've never been super impressed.  We decided to try Ping Pang Pong since it was in a casino, and we figured it would provide the necessary cleanliness that I find to be generally lacking in dim sum spots.  \n\nWe got there 15 minutes before they opened on Sunday, and there was a line of 3-4 parties waiting in front  of us.  By the time they opened, there were another 5-6 parties behind us.  Shortly after we began dining, the place was full.  Good sign.  The wait staff was surprisingly Chinese - I say that because this is inside the Gold Coast and I would have thought the wait staff would be more diverse - and resulted in a service very typical to other dim sum restaurants.  They spoke little English, and often called out the dish in Chinese even after realizing we were not Chinese.  The d\u00e9cor was clean and typically nice for a casino restaurant, so this part we enjoyed quite a bit - dim sum in a clean environment.\n\nThe food was actually quite good.  It was quite distinctly lacking of the dumplings and shumai that we were looking for, they just kept telling us it would come later and they would come in trickles.  But what did eventually come - shrimp shumai and shrimp & pork shumai - were very good.  But alas, no har gow, no rice noodle rolls with shrimp (they had one with beef...), and just not enough choices of these little pieces.  What they did have though, were interesting and not common.  Congee porridge is common, and theirs is good.  They have a large bowl for the table and a smaller bowl for one.  They had cooked congee in spice broth which were excellent, and clams in similar sauce that were great also.  Their souffle-type dessert (they only make 10 per day) was delicious, as well as the custard flavor rolls.\n\nOne big issue I had with them were that the dessert dishes started coming out first, and just kept coming around.  Why do they do that?  Bring out the porridge and dumplings first!  We kept having to tell them \"later, after we eat!\" as the dessert trays passed by probably at least half dozen times.  They've got to fix this.\n\nBut all-in-all a good meal, and our meal for 4 came to $49 plus tips.  That's not a bad deal, and perhaps I can overlook some of their glaring shortcomings.  3.5 stars is more appropriate, but I'll bump up a half based on the quality of what we actually did get to eat.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  May be for regular lunch & dinner, but for the dim sum brunch it's probably not a great option."

Warning: get here early to avoid the long lines of people trying to get some shrimp balls. \nAs soon as the host directs you to your seat, be prepared to be asked if you're interested with plate after plate of dim sum & other Chinese concoctions. Items are not priced the same, obviously, so it's a guessing game how much they will charge you at the end of your meal (although they do stamp your order summary with some item/menu codes like in other dim sum places) but it really doesn't matter because the food is good any time of the day. Try the almond coated shrimp & shrimp balls on green bell pepper with black bean sauce with any of their special fried rice. The flavor lingers in your mouth like white on rice. Lol, rice coz I'm Asian. Lots of yummy things here & there; yummy things are everywhere! Order a glass of Thai iced tea or some hot tea to wash out the after taste. Sesame balls are always good to close out a filling meal. Got my full meal, & I was one satisfied customer."

They have a sign pointing to a waiting area just outside of the restaurant, but they didn't seem to have a dedicated host. I stood there for at least 5 minutes before they even so much as said hi to the party in front of us, and another 5 before they seated us. It was very busy, but at least I should've been welcomed, and I'm pretty sure there were at least a couple of open tables.\n\nBy the way, try to park at the side of Gold Coast farthest from the Rio if you want to have a shorter walk, which is healthier than it sounds due to less secondhand smoke exposure.\n\nAnyway, as with any good dim sum place, we were able to dive right in since the carts made their rounds quickly. My friend started off the picks with a har gow (4 pieces), a shu mai (4), and a rather large and unfamiliar bowl of some sort of tripe with ginger and daikon. I later got us a plate of shrimp stuffed eggplant pieces (3), some deep fried shrimp balls with sugar cane (2) and some nice compact egg tarts (2). The last item was the chicken feet that my friend was pining for the whole time.\n\nEverything was definitely on the high end of good. All the savory items had sufficient flavor and non-mushiness, and the egg tarts were very flaky and were still noticeably warm at the end of the meal even though I'd ordered them at the start. I didn't fall in love with any one dish, but the quality was solid overall. Prices are probably a bit more than you'd expect since it's a casino restaurant and there's not all that many dim sum shops here. It was most likely $5.88 each for the tripe bowl and chicken feet, per my friend, and we had one $2.18 order, four $2.88 items, and one $3.88 dish. Couldn't tell you which is which since I'm not that much of a dim sum connoisseur, sorry! \n\nOverall, I wasn't blown away by any single item, but it was solid dim sum and I definitely prefer this to East Ocean, which has seemed a little lacking for me the past couple of trips for some reason. I also definitely appreciated that we got a tangerine and candy here instead of a fortune cookie (looking at you, East Ocean). I have not been to KJ yet, so stay tuned in case I decide to hit them up."

It's the ultimate fatty dish with lots of cholesterol but it's so dang good. \n\nTea Smoked Duck ($16.95)- roasted duck in a wrap with boison sauce on the side.

Like others have mentioned, this certainly is a hidden gem.\n\nA couple of friends attending the jewelry trade show at the Mandalay had invited me to a nice quiet high end dinner at the Jasmine Restaurant at the Bellagio when , just as we were about to leave for the Bellagio, my friend received a business call saying their business contacts wanted to invite us for dinner instead.....and were too afraid to decline. All I knew was that I was asked to get in the car and just follow the leader.\n\nBeing the fish out of water, I didn't speak a or understand a word of Chinese and had no idea what the plan was. We eventually ended up off the strip at some big stand alone casino across from the Palms Hotel and Casino. As we walked into the casino from the parking garage, my friend whispered to me that the host was taking us to a Chinese restaurant, and if she eats hear you can bet it's going to be VERY good! The host has been living in Vegas for over 30 years so she should know where all the good eating spots are now.....ok, so in we go. This was a medium end casino, and as we walked through it we finally came upon this Chinese Restaurant called \"Ping Pang Pong\"..... yes, you got that right....just as I've spelled it. Flashbacks of the movie \"16 Candles\" flashed through my head, but I'll leave that one alone :)\n\nTucked inside the casino is this very casual, very Chinese looking, restaurant with an open kitchen concept where you can hear the burners blasting away and the woks clanging away. The place was quite crowded, but it appeared our host knew everybody there and I was told she is a VIP guest there. We came to the table and there sat 4 other of her elderly friends already seating and waiting for us. Oh boy.....there goes my hopes for a peaceful and relaxing dinner. Ok, lets cut it short and say that it was a very typical large table seating for a group of elderly folk who enjoyed their meals with loud talk.....the red wine they were gulping down didn't seem to help matters either. Anyway, I did not understand a single word spoken at the table all night, but no worries.....I had food to keep me busy!......good authentic Chinese food at that! And note, when I say this is authentic food, I mean authentic.....PF Chang's and Panda Express are NOT authentic :P\n\nI pretty much left the ordering to the host and her friends since they seemed to know what good Chinese food should taste like. Needless to say they ordered all very authentic dishes that westerners likely wouldn't have known how to order. Without going into too much detail about each dish.....because I really can't remember the names of each one......we started off with lotus root soup which was very good....absolutely delicious, and coincidentally is my favorite Chinese soup! There was a roast duck dish, lotus root stir fried with celery and rice wine sauce, egg white fried rice with dried scallops, stir fried cubes of beef with a dark brown sauce, ginger and scallion lobster over noodles, farm raised chicken cooked with chestnuts and rice wine, some green vegetables with baby abalone and sauce, sea bass steamed with black beans, ............and I think that was it. It was ALL yummy, and I was really surprised at finding this quality and standard of Chinese food all the way out here! But yes, it exists. Yay! :)\n\nAll these delicious dishes for 9 people came to about $295 before tips, which was actually pretty good given the excellent quality of the food. If I should ever find several friends who'll join me for a good Chinese meal during future visits, I will definitely bring them here!"

But go early, there is a long line at lunch time.  The line moves, but I wouldn't say it moves fast.   The dim sum place in Rio (KJ's) is a little more on the nicer side, but personally, having been to both I prefer Ping Pang Pong."

Seeing its popularity on Yelp and its long business hours, I assumed it would be ok to have lunch in the early afternoon. Upon arriving around 2pm, there was a line around 15 parties. Once seated, we only saw two types of carts circulating:one with hot dishes and one baked goods. That was it. When asked about other usual dim sum dishes, none of them was available. We were told the kitchen has closed. What a disappointment. For the dishes that were available, they were just ok, nothing special beyond any regular dim sum places in the Bay Area. Lessons learned: only go there during busy time but then one has to endure the long line in the smoke filled casino. I would try one of those stand alone dim sum places next time."

It was really busy with a lot of older Asian people which we thought was a good sign since they are normally picky about Chinese food. We were daring and ordered three dishes: Stir fried lamb with vegetables, combination spicy chow mein and a scallop in oyster sauce hot pot. The prices were reasonable at around $8 to $10 a dish. We also got hot tea, rice and each got a bowl of soup for free with our meal. The food was delicious. We were worried about the scallop hot pot because normally scallops are overcooked and taste chewy. But here, the scallops melted because they were perfectly cooked. Also, the sauce included cloves of roasted garlic that were just as good as the scallops. We ended up finishing all of our food without feeling greasy or gross like at many other Chinese places. A bonus is being able to see into the kitchen and watching the chefs cook the food.\n\nTried the dim sum here. Surprised at the price at only $2.88 and $3.88 per dish. Friendly service and rather quick seating even when they were really busy."

Gave it 4 stars.\n\nUPDATE: \nWe returned on 2011-04-16 for dim sum lunch.  Food was still reasonably good, but it seems to have lost a bit in the quality.  They were out of some items we wanted such as har gow (we got there a bit late), and the food overall seemed to lack some seasoning; some of the sauces seemed watered down.

            "review": "People in Las Vegas are usually too drunk or just not smart enough to realize what bad service looks like. \n\nI have been coming here for 3 years because the Gold Coast comps me all the time. The Food has always been 5-stars, but the service is so bad that in the last 2 years, I have NEVER left a tip. And everyone around this town knows I am a big tipper. I mean, my local sushi spot is a place in NW Las Vegas called \"Sushi Bomb\". The chefs and servers are so friendly and nice to me that even though my bill comes out to $32.00, I will pay with a $100 and tell them to keep the change. So Yes, I am not afraid to tip if the service is that good. \n\nWhat is wrong with Ping Pang Pong? At 1st I thought it was a cultural misunderstanding. I noticed that most the workers speak barely any English and most are from Mainland China and not Taiwan(Taiwanese restaurants are always much more friendly). But, even other Chinese people who come here get into big fights with the servers and complain all the time about how bad the service is. \n\nCommon problems here: \n-You go up to the counter and wait for the host to seat you or put you on the list. 15 minutes later, the host will not come over. She won't even give you eye contact or say: \"I will be right with you\". When the host finally comes she doesn't even know how to seat you. You would think that since this has been her job for the last 2-3 years she would have finally figured out how to do it right, but somehow she still hasn't got it down. Common sense says that the person at the front of the line should be the person you should service, but she will just pick a random person at times. \n-Many times(and this happens a lot) a drunk from the casino who doesn't have the coherency to stand in line will attempt to cut infront of you. The server WILL seat him instead even though you shout at her that the drunk cut in line. \n-After waiting about 40minutes, you will get seated. After that you will have to wait another 15-20 minutes for your server to come take you order. \n-Another 35-40minutes later your food will finally arrive. Sometimes(and this happens a lot also) your food will NEVER arrive, and you will have to complain to the servers. They somehow lose your orders a lot here. If your order does come, many times the order will be WRONG. This is a headache because now you will have to wait another 30 minutes for the right one to come out.\n-Once the server takes your order, you will NEVER see another server come around ever again. If you want srirachi or water...tough luck because no ones is gonna get it for you! No one will ever even come around 1 time to check up on you or ask you if there is anything you need. Yet, these people still expect a tip?\n-If there is a mistake with the bill(example-they charged you for something you didn't order-And this happens here a lot too), the staff speaks such limited English that is will take forever for you to get them to understand  what your problems is.\n\n\nNow the thing I see a lot is that many people will complain about all of the things I listed above. They will complain about how bad the service is, yet they will still leave a tip! By leaving a tip you are just encouraging them to keep up their rude, lazy and incompetent service.  Okay I will admit that The food here at Ping Pang Pong is the best Chinese Food in the world....So it is only justified that the service should meet up to the standards of how good the food is. So my solution to end the bad service here for good is to STOP TIPPING until they learn. \n\nI know the management reads these things. They know who I am. I am the guy who wears the Burberry Coats and I usually show up with  2 extremely tall Japanese and Korean-Americans. We come almost every week.\n\n.....btw, the service is so slow that expect to be here for 2-3 hours."

The line wasn't too bad for us, and we were seated shortly, even though it was on a Sunday at ~11:30am.\n\nThe restaurant itself seems small, especially compared to the other dim sum options i Vegas.  The price overall is more expensive, and is to be expected for a restaurant located inside a casino (Gold Coast).  The per person charge for tea is only $0.50!  That is the lowest I have ever seen, even compared to off-strip dim sum joints.  But then they do make it up on everything else you can order.\n\nThe wait staff is friendly, but I think they are assigned way too many tables to watch over, especially the busperson, since our emptied plates rarely gets picked up after we finished whatever dim sum we had ordered, and the table looks like it is in a constant state of disarray. Not exactly adding to the mood of the meal. But our water glass was refilled on a regular basis, which is good. That applies to the tea pots as well.\n\nFood-wise, I think it is just okay.  There were some highlights but also many that was not worth ever trying again.  The Panfried Shrimp and Chive Dumpling was excellent. The \"fat noodles\" stirred fried with XO Sauce (my pinyin sucks but I will try to type it... Stir Fried ChanFun with XO Sauce) is good and we ended up ordering two plates. HarGow (Steamed Shrimp Dumpling), was made with great fillings, but the skin was way too thick and you can tell that the cooks or prep cooks that make them lack the skills normally developed over many years of making dim sum.  But what do you expect from a casino restaurant that might have a really good chef, but the rest of the kitchen are cooks, prep cooks, etc that are just happy to still have a job in a state that has stupidly high unemployment rate.\n\nAnyway, back to the food. They seem to have trouble keeping up with the demand for the essential dim sums (steamed shrimp and steamed pork dumplings), since we didn't see the Hargow until we were almost ready to get them to tally up our bill. And the Shuimai never made it to the area we were seated until we were collecting money from everyone at the table.\n\nI did kind of enjoyed their Green Tea Mochi Cake, although the mochi was on the thick side. But I have never had this at any other dim sum restaurants in the US. The Mango Coconut Tapioca was good, according to my friend (I didn't try it).\n\nAnd even though we have a party of 8, they did NOT automatically add in the \"mandatory\" service charge/tips.  I think that was cool, but we paid over the 15% anyways.\n\nOverall, just a 3 stars dim sum experience for me, and I will likely not returned for just dim sum. But it is nice to eat at a dim sum place that at least have above average customer service."

It was about a 15 minute wait for a party of 7. The FIRST thing I noticed was the overwhelming amount of Mandarin and Cantonese speaking patrons; seemed promising.\n\nFOOD\nLadies push around dim sum carts and call out the dishes in Cantonese.

The rest of the dishes were mediocre; they either lacked quality ingredients, were tiny (dumplings) compared to the norm and/or on the dry side. But when you're starving and there's a lack of good dim sum options, it sufficed just fine.\n\nS E R V I C E\nPerhaps, I'm so use to rude service at Asian restaurants that I didn't find the service at PPP even the slight bit rude. Our waiter brought things quickly when we asked for it and refilled our waters promptly. This in itself is already a rarity in most Chinese restaurants.\n \nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nWith a name like Ping Pang Pong, it's no wonder that it excudes the typical stereotypical d\u00e9cor of Chinese village roof shingles, red paper lanterns and waitstaff in mandarin collared outfits. Most importantly, It was CLEAN!\n\nWith a plethora of dim sum restaurants in San Francisco, PPP would probably rank a 2.5-3 STARS in SF. However, considering Vegas has a scant amount of decent Asian restaurants and we left stuffed for only $15/person (including tip) they do deserve a better than average rating."

So it is what it is. Not to bad, not too close.\n\n2.  Ambiance - I knock off a star for it being or having a very odd feeling. It is kinda open to the casino floor, and it seems to be that the restaurant was stuck here, rather than designed to be here.  You have to walk through the smokey casino to get to the restaurant and then there is always a lingering amount of smoke from the people smoking outside the restaurant.\n\n3.  Note - You have to go to use the casino bathrooms, which while they are not far at all, you still have to go through the casino. Not an issue if you are a casino lover.\n\n4.  Food - Not bad.  The carts of dim sum did not seem to weave an order that I could detect.  You have to flag them down. The food itself is good, yet when you have to search out the cart , wait and wait it dampers the experience a bit.  For this I knock off 1/2 a star.\n\n5.  Service - Not bad, but kinda like \"we are busy\" and \"you should be happy to wait for a table\" type attitude.  This type of attitude does not bother me greatly, however, it also does not endear loyalty and a pleasant experience. With so many great restaurants opening up that serve dim sum, they need to up their game.\n\nWhat happened?  They used to be highly rated and I find them to be pretty good, yet not highly rated.\n\nWorth a try for sure."

The selection is limited and depends on what didn't sell that morning. Hey, it's better than nothing....the only late night dimsum (Kan's) closed. \n\nWe ended up getting:\n\nShrimp Har Gao- the shrimp and wrapper was fine, but I think the wrapper is slightly too thick.\nShumai- I did not like their version. Something about the taste just doesn't work for me and was just OK. \nShrimp cake- these were tasty. They were panfried so it was crisp and inside was dense cake, shrimp and green onion. \n\nWe also got off the menu:\n\nMapo Tofu ($7.95)- pretty good. The meat had a sausage like flavor to it which was interesting since most just throw plain ground meat. Tofu is always noms to me.\n\nSalt&Pepper Pork Chop ($9.95)- the fry was light so the texture was nice. Funny that \"salt\" is part of the name, but it needed a tad more of that. \n\nI was surprised by the prices. I honestly thought it would be more at a casino, but it's about the same pricing as some of the nicer Chinese restaurant on Spring Mountain Rd. I think it was very fair priced and the quality was good. \n\nThe service was friendly and pretty on it with drinks and checking up on us. \n\nWill be coming back for daytime dimsum....one of these days we'll actually wake up early enough for it."

When we're here for dim sum, I will get anything shrimpy and fried with the sweet mayonnaise. How can you go wrong with the combination of those 3? My favorite of which are the sesame shrimp rolls. \n\nWhen we're here for dinner, we always get the Peking duck, walnut shrimp, and garlic snow pea chutes. At the sound of duck, my 4 year old will pounce for the legs and happily sit there for the next 10 minutes nibbling at them. The skin is crunchy and the duck is meaty compared to other restaurants that serve some starving ducks. Walnut shrimp are crispy fried shrimp with glazed walnuts covered in more of my favorite sweet mayonnaise. Snow pea chutes are ordered to get our vegetable intake for the evening and taste like almost any Chinese vegetable because it's always covered in a garlic, sesame oil stir fry. The snow pea chutes are just nice, tender. and really good at sopping up the garlicky goodness.\n\nOverall, 4 stars because they have great food. I think it's a bit pricey because it's in a casino, but since I never have to pay for it (thanks dad!), the price is just right."

And then visiting Ping Pang Pong for lunch and dinner.  PPP offers authentic Chinese dim sum with some unique items which I don't see in SCal, or maybe I have yet to visit to the ones that serve the similar dim sum fare.  Chill waitresses, friendly service, they are more than happy to show you what's in those little tins from their carts. \n\nThe porridge with century old eggs was very satisfying, I was half full after eating it.  Enough century old egg pieces in it to qualify for the name if you know what I mean.  Here is my YAY!(\u203f) \n\nThe slow cooked/simmered snails ($5.88) on dim sum menu is probably quite common in Hong Kong, but it's rare in the States.  Definitely a winner.  They were easy to be taken out from the shell, nothing broke off in the process, marvelous!  I enjoy doing that!  They were very flavorful, slightly spicy but not too spicy and had a nice chewiness to them.  What a treat!  Good times. ()\n\nThe shrimp ball with sticky rice is a variation from the well known \u7ef5\u9633\u4e09\u84b8\uff0cbut theirs have more vegetable matter and less shrimp matter than I expected.  Still good though, and goes well with the egg white dipping sauce.  \n\nAfter I spotted the snails, fried shrimp balls with sugar cane ($5.88) were put on the back burner, I ended up taking them to go.  Those shrimp balls got nothing on them snails.  They didn't taste that good when they were cold, they probably taste better when they were freshly made.  \n\nThe disc shaped sticky rice patty with lotus seed paste is the kind of mochi that I like to have for snack.  Not too sweet but sticky enough.  I should have got some to go.\n\nCan't resist the sight of any pan fried dumplings, how can I?  Just look at their pan fried bottoms.  In this case, the bun was perfect but the filling needed to be bigger and more substantial with more meat.\n\nThis restaurant is shaped right, the circular floor plan goes well with la rotunda breadbasket of mine. I like the decor too, very Chinese in a traditional way.  (\u00ac\u203f\u00ac)\n\nEncouraged by the dim sum success, I thought I would try their dinner.  I wasn't particularly inspired by the porridge with abalone ($9.99) which didn't have much flavor as I expected.  I had better ones at a friend's house with chucks of abalone pieces.  But this is how they make it in most Cantonese restaurants, you get the thinly sliced abalone pieces in the porridge.  Dried abalone is some kind of delicacy, but quality various.  Those were definitely not the best I've had.  And they don't put much in there.  If you read the knock-off version of Sun Tzu Art of War, and take the last strategy's number, minus 2 dozens, that's the number of abalone slices I got in the porridge.\n\nWhen I was having dinner, I noticed they (the managers or the ppl by the register) just let the customers waiting by the door without acknowledging them and telling them how long the wait would be, that's rude."

The dishes we enjoyed the most were the assorted sweet and savory buns as well as the Shrimp Cheong Fun with plump shrimps.  The Sui Miu was tasty with the right amount of meat as was the tofu wrap.\n\nThere were a few misses.  The shrimp dumpling (har gow) was bland tasting shrimp with mushy, thick wrap. The Rice w/ Lotus Leaf (Lo Mai Gai) was mostly rice with minimal amount of meat and other ingredients.  The fried chicken wings were the worse with an odd mix of spices and too much grease.  We also ordered an item with rice and small spareribs. It was tasty but some of the ribs were fatty.\n\n\nThe dim sum dishes were inexpensive with dishes around $3 with generally tasty dishes and generous meat stuffing."

There was a fair number of shrimp and some small slices of pork along with onions.  The curry flavor was good.  For my taste, I could have used a bit more.  We got an order of wrinkled green beans.  I don't think they were seared as much as they should have been to make them wrinkled.  They were crisp.  Their flavor was very good.  Finally, we got the half roasted Cantonese duck.  The flavor of the duck was a winner, too!  I'm not a big fan of duck when it's on the bone, but this was cooked well.  \n\nService was good.  My iced tea refilled often without asking.  We did have to ask a server to bring us some clean plates so we could get rid of some of the duck bones.  \n\nThe one drawback of Ping Pang Pong was the loudness of the place for the first 1/3 of the hour and a half we were there.  It was so noisy from people talking loudly and the kitchen staff, filling orders for take out and yelling the orders to each other.\n\nI do like the place and I will be back if only for the Singapore noodles.

I was not expecting much when I arrived at Ping Pang Pong this past weekend, but began to fan little fires of hopes when I saw a restaurant filled with Chinese people and outfitted with a long line also filled with Chinese people.\n\nWhen they served us a steaming pot of Chinese red tea (forget the stereotypical Jasmine green), my hopes went from little flames to a pretty sizable campfire.  When the cart arrived and I had to explain to the Chinese cart-tender lady what I was looking for since she only spoke marginal English, I felt like I traveled through space and was suddenly in Arcadia.  \n\nMy favorites, Siu Mai and Har Gow, more than passed the test.  Siu Mai was surprisingly topped with fish eggs, which added a much-welcomed dynamic in texture.  Har Gow was delicious due to fresh shrimp fillings and a properly-made dough that didn't dry up after five minutes on the cart like the other Vegas Dim Sum joints.  My new adventure, Rice Paper-Wrapped Youtiao (Chinese fried bread stick) filled with Pork, was a perfect combination of tastes, textures, and ingredients. \n\nOur late arrival cost me my Dim Sum must-have: egg tarts; which provides me with a good reason to come back and visit this Sunday.  In the future, I will no longer avoid restaurants that are in funky casinos like the Gold Coast.  I could be missing out on a lot of yummy egg tarts."

We headed straight for the Gold Coast Hotel and luckily we still had about 50 mins before the dim sum ended at 3pm.\n\nPing Pang Pong might be a catchy name to entice Mid-Westerners into the establishment, but in Chinese, this place is actually called \"Golden Ingot\" -- a form of ancient Chinese currency.

They have your typical dim sum eats (shu mai, Har gao, sesame balls, baos, etc.) and the food alone was a solid 4 stars.

The 5 main carts being pushed around only passed us maybe 2x in the hour and a half we were there. \n\nBottom line, if you don't have the luxury of time or blessed with the ability to be patient when you're starving, don't come. If you do come, try to show up early, and try to be seated in the main dining area where the carts like to pass you 10x more than the other area that is blocked off by a wall. \n\nFood was expensive, for dim sum. The 3 of us ordered maybe 13 cart items, with tea, and our total was $75 and some change. Sorry, but I'm from LA, and the cost of dim sum there is about 1/2 with even better food, and just as bad service lol. But I guess for Vegas quality dim sum, this is one of the \"better\" options. \n\nThe shu mai was really good, and the red bean sesame ball was epically good. Not worth coming back though. We tipped them under 3% for the jack ass waiter who pitched a tone at my mom when she was complaining to him about lack of cart service.

I would visit again but I will only tip them based on service!"

I ordered the Chilean sea bass which was not what I expected, It looked more like some sort of pancake but was not so bad it was breaded which I am not a fan of and a little to greasy. One of the group ordered a tofu dish that was great! I think that was almost the favorite of at least 3 of us! We also had some shrimp and if I remember right pork chops? We also had some hot and sour soup. Overall the food was pretty good but we were all pretty hungry also!

When I used to work at Boeing I used to go to Top Gun in Bellevue and Imperial Garden in Renton a bit for Dim Sum and loved it, so I'm comparing this to those establishments.\n\nI had one order of Shumai, one Shrimp Dumpling, one steamed  Pork Bun, and after I was full they had fried crab claws that I couldn't say no to.  I felt like I ate way too much food, even though the plates were tiny.  The Shumai was ok, it has nothing on Top Gun's Shumai which is my favorite ever.  The shrimp dumplings at Imperial Garden are also superior but these were good.  The real star of my meal here was those crab claws, though.  I really loved those which is why I feel Ping Pang Pong gets four stars.\n\nSo my husband, who isn't a real dim sum fan outside of baked pork buns, or a fan of Asian food in general because he never had it in his native alien territory of Montana, found out I went here and now wants to go, so I'm happy to say I will drag him here soon and get some of those crab claws again."

The heat was right with Szechuan pepper.  Its just that no other flavors seemed present.  Lots of tofu not enough pork. Bland.\n\nNoodles were completely tasteless.\n\nMo Shoo Pork was excellent.  No question.  It came as an appetizer.  Two large pre-filled rices pancakes.  At first bite i realized it needed Hoisin sauce. The next bite made me realize I needn't ask for it as it was already in there.  Wood ear mushrooms even.  Plenty of pork and veggies.\n\nThe price for all this was under $60.  Myself and two Partners-in-Dine would have been happier if the food tasted as good as those few dishes did.\n\nWhen we were ready to pay our check there were no servers on the floor. We realized an entire table of six or seven eating dinner one table over from ours were the entirety of floor STAFF having dinner together.\n\nWe had to get up and pay at the register waiting in line behind several other diners waiting to pay their bills.

They open each lid and quickly describe what the container holds, you simply nod or say \"no thank you\". Whatever you chose is quickly put on your table, and the carts move on. It's very efficient and artistic in a way. \n\nOk, the food itself: everything we had was good. My favorite was the steamed BBQ pork bun. I wish I had known a bit more, or would have been braver.

Each server spoke English, and was nice. \n\nMy only suggestion is that maybe they could have a menu for us newbies, so we could better understand what delicious little treats are hidden in each of those little pots. \n\nPricing is very reasonable, hard to tell what each pot costs. They mark on a card each time you make a selection. I think we had 6 selections (each pot has about 3 dumplings). It was enough for 2 to share, and our bill was about $24."

            "review": "The general consensus on yelp is that PPP has very good to great Chinese food and bad service. I can say that is right on. We ordered several items and found the portions to be hearty and flavorful. I would recommend to anyone on food alone. This is not a place you order orange chicken and other Panda Express fare. \nNow the bad, total disorganized mess trying to get seated. While waiting in the designated spot multiple people were seated before us just because they were a) clueless and just walked up to the pay register b) jerks for skipping line or c) in the know and didn't feel like waiting in line like a rube\nWe ordered a dish off the chefs special menu which was mushrooms, bamboo and sausage. When it arrived there was no sausage. When we flagged down the waitress after some confusion she devised the story that the translation of sausage was asparagus. So she did not say sorry and come back with the sausage she instead insults our meager intelligence. I'd like to point out that one side of menu is written in Chinese characters then in English on other side. So even if there was some regional dialect in which the word sausage somehow meant asparagus, it feels ludicrous to even type that, then why would the English translation say \"sausage\"? The explanation itself made no sense not to mention this type of confusion would happen 12x a night if that were the case. What kind of maniac would just automatically assume sausage actually meant asparagus? The mere man hours involved in handling all the complaints would require a quick menu revision. ANYWAY, since it was so tasty we overlooked it but I'm fairly sure not everyone would just be cool with such a dumb explanation, non apology.\nPing Pang Pong is like the good looking person who can get away with being a jerk because they are so attractive. I'll probably go back but as soon as the food quality slips some this place will be a ghost town much like the aging beauty who treated people like servants her whole life"

            "review": "This place is a disaster!\n\nWe went on a Sunday Night for dinner. They have a big dim sum service on Sunday morning/afternoon which basically leaves them with no food on Sunday night. We tried to order appetizers, but they literally did not have any left. NONE! No spring rolls, no potstickers, nothing! Seriously people, if you are out of food close the restaurant, don't stay open and disappoint your customers because they can't order what they want.\n\nAs for the foods that they did have, my sister ordered the duck, I ordered the orange chicken, my brother-in-law ordered a brisket thing and our friend ordered the chicken chow mein. The cooks all make different foods and don't sync up the food to come out at the same time. So when an entree is done they bring it out to your table, even if the other entrees aren't ready yet. The duck came first, it was a few minutes before the orange chicken came out, and then another 5 minutes at least before the chow mein came out. This would be fine it you are eating family style and everyone is sharing everything, but if you are ordering and eating your own entree like we were it creates a big problem. You can either be rude and eat your food while it's hot, or be polite and wait for everyone to get their food while yours gets cold.\n\nYou will notice that I said my brother-in-law ordered a brisket something but I didn't mention when it got delivered. That's because we never got it! Another problem with the way they bring the food out is if they forget something, you just kind of assume it's still coming, and you don't think to ask about it. Our waitress never ordered the brisket, and we didn't discover this until it was too late.\n\nAs for the food itself, my sister was happy with the duck, but I didn't try it as duck is not my thing. The orange chicken was okay, but I've had much better.\n\nObviously being as our server forgot to order one of our entrees I'm not going to give the service a very high mark. Additionally, the atmosphere of the restaurant was really bad. It's located in the casino, very close to all the slot machines and casino action and as a result is very loud. It's a small space and they try to cram as many people in as possible so its very cramped and uncomfortable.\n\nSo to review, the food is bland but okay, the service and atmosphere sucks and if you go on Sunday night (and I would assume Saturday too) expect them to be out of everything."

The food was pretty good, but the overall experience was kind of blah.\n\nThe restaurant itself is inside the Orleans, off to the side, and gated in,  but not really closed off from the casino.  There are paintings of happy Asian babies on the walls, and the clinking, and beeping of slot machines in the air.  The machines are only about 15 feet away, so there's cigarette smoke wafting in too.  \n\nI very rarely drink soda, so when I do, I want it to be kind of special. There was nothing special about my watered down Pepsi.  :(\nI told the server that the soda tasted off, and that the syrup needed to be changed.  He nodded, took my glass, ran off, and came back with the exact same crap, which kind of pissed me off.  Whatever.  We didn't come for the Pepsi.\n\nPot stickers:  These were really good. The wrappers were thicker than any pot stickers I've tried before.  They reminded me more of Russian pilmeni (I love those, so it worked out).\n\nHot and sour soup:  My boyfriend had a serious issue with this soup. He looked borderline pissed off after trying it.  It wasn't really spicy, or sour.  In fact, we were pretty sure it wasn't hot and sour soup, but the server assured us that it was.  I thought it tasted fine, but it wasn't what either of us expected, or craved. Lame.\n\nKung Pao chicken:  I thought this dish was great.  The chicken was juicy, all white meat, and perfectly sauced.  \n\nShanghai noodles:  The noodles were cooked well, and the vegetable ratio was nice.  The mushrooms in it were really tasty, but the pork was barely there.  It came in tiny half-inch slivers, thinner than the noodles themselves.  It was delicious, but it should have had more meat in it.\n\nOverall, it was okay, but I doubt we'd come back."

After we were seated, no one introduced themselves to us as our server, so we didn't even know who our server was the entire time. Our drink order wasn't taken and tea wasn't brought to us until about 15 minutes after being seated and us having to flag someone down.

All of these restaurants would hover around 3 stars and dipped as low as being inedible depending on change of chefs and perhaps even ownership.  Then along came the idea of trying Ping Pang Pong inside the Gold Coast casino.\n\nThe litmus test for dim sum for me are the cheong fun, the har gow, the oven baked char siu bao, chicken feet, and anything with shrimp.  While the sauce of the cheong fun was very light, the noodles were soft and the shrimp were fresh. The har gow skin was soft and the shrimp again fresh.  The char siu bao was the right combination of sweet and salty.  Chicken feet were not too soft and not too hard.  Did I mention the shrimp were fresh?!\n\nYes, it's considerably pricier than all the other dim sum restaurants I mentioned but it's worth it.  And yes, it's also frigid cold like another reviewer said because that's how casinos keep you awake but it's nothing hot tea and a sweater can't fix.  And yes, it can get very crowded since it's actually a fairly small dining room for a dim sum restaurant, not to mention a dim sum restaurant in a casino known for its Asian clientel, but go before 11:30 am and you'll be fine since most are either at the gambling tables or are sleeping in from being at the gambling tables all night."

            "review": "Here's the story-- I was in Vegas at a trade show, a colleague had this place recommended to him as 'great Chinese' so we agreed to try it for dinner. I had the opportunity to check out the Yelp reviews beforehand, so I could see that the general consensus was: don't come weekdays, come weekends for dim sum. We came on a Monday night. I'm a somewhat adventurous eater, so I figured, what the heck.\n\nBad idea. I have to say--- probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. And I'm a very forgiving person. So I DEFINITELY do not recommend coming for dinner on a weeknight. You can decide for yourself if you want to take the chance that it's so much better on weekends as others have noted.\n\nThe story: 3 of us got there about 8, the place was maybe 3/4 full during our visit. We ordered 3 dim sum plates for appetizers. These eventually came out, one at a time, about 15 minutes apart. The dim sum was really tasty, but the slow delivery was a bad omen.\n\nWaitress eventually came back to take our entree orders. Colleague #1 got his entree approx. 30 minutes later. Colleague #2 got his entree approx. 30 minutes after colleague #1. Colleague #3 (me) got his entree approx. 30 minutes after colleague #2.  And I had ordered tofu!! During this hour and a half wait, we asked the waitress several times about our order, and she wandered off and came back with various excuses each time. It was clear the kitchen had forgetten entirely about my order. But even from the time they realized they had forgetten me, it STILL took at least 30 minutes to get the food out to our table.\n\nHorrible. And just to make the night memorable for all, my colleague #2, who had ordered a scallop dish, came down with food poisoning that night which stuck with him for the next several days.\n\nOh, and if you haven't been to the Gold Coast before-- it's a dump."

After playing bingo, yes we played bingo :P ... we were hungry and I read decent reviews on yelp.. Where else in Vegas can you find good food at these prices?? I went to Noodles @ the Bellagio the next night and spent twice as much and the food was just okay. \nMy friend had the Walnut Prawns and I ordered the Classic Cantonese Brisket Stew. My mom makes a great brisket chinese style of course with tendon. This version was pretty good, quite flavorful, had a perfect balance of meat, tendon was so soft and big pieces of turnip as well. My friend thought it was missing something... My mom usually puts dried orange peel, but I thought it was fine without it. His prawns were okay, perhaps a bit too small so the shrimps weren't as meaty. The honey glazed walnuts weren't as good. We usually get this dish at our local chinese restaurant and it's so good! I opted for a pot of tea while my friend got a coke. The tea was quite bland with just one cheap tea bag floating inside. Thank goodness I was staying at the Mandarin Oriental and snagged a couple of quality tea bags. Made a more enjoyable pot of tea. \nDinner for two was just $35 with tip, a bargain even off the strip! We really would've gone back a 2nd time had it not been so far away..."

Tea, take dirty dishes away, bring my food. It's all good in the Chinese hood. If you're scared go to Elephant bar, Jose or Sean Jean will make you something nice there. I'm not racist I eat black chicken. \n\nSeriously about the service, you can have a good ole' dim sum time without making at the least bit eye contact. Oh and lastly, I think I read a review about hot mustard... do they have hot mustard? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. I'm not going to answer that expect a hahahahaha if you ask. \n\nNo seriously eating dim sum is not that hard. I'm just making fun. I gotta go piss off Japanese people by rubbing my wooden chopsticks together down the street while I contemplate what's so delicious about Teriyaki. \n\nHo Sek Ah!"

Not the worst, but far from acceptable.  The multiple times I've come here on occasion I've noticed how most of the employees look like they HATE their job and the customers.  I've had the dishes flung upon the table a few times.  Relax lady XD. There are better places to eat, plus I dislike the line here.  They are pretty terrible at seating, many a time was there open tables and no one being seated.  Sigh... 2 stars because a 3 would be somewhere I'd come back to."

Excellent tasting food with good portions. We shared between 5 people 5 dishes and we were all stuffed after we were done. The Chinese tea was too light in flavor for me, but the 2nd pot brought out tasted better.\nWe met family from Hawaii for dinner. Everyone loved the food. Well done!

We arrived at 11am and was seated at 11:40am even with our Emerald card, which gives us priority seating. Many people were in line and some just went to the front of the line to talk to the hostess. Most were confused as to which line to get in. Make sure you give your name and the number in your party to the hostess; she will then give you a piece of paper with a number that she will eventually call out. Most of the people were inpatient and kept going to the hostess and asking her questions. There were several who looked through the reservation book when the hostess stepped away. It was definitely crowded and as soon as we sat down, we started eating.\n\nThe food was great! We had the seaweed salad, BBQ pork noodles, shrimp noodles, pork dumpling, shrimp dumpling, spring rolls, crab balls, spare ribs, BBQ pork buns, BBQ pork pastries, Chinese broccoli, chicken wings, sausage in a bun, potstickers, sesame balls - the usual dishes that we order when we have dimsum. What we couldn't believe was the bill! It was $110 for five adults and one child! Then, I looked over the bill and noticed that they charged us twice for the Chinese broccoli ($8.95 twice!). They did correct the bill, but then we started to question whether the rest of the bill was correct. They charged us for 23 dimsum plates, but we didn't keep track and count our plates! They could have easily charged us an extra 2-3 plates and we wouldn't have known it. As regular dimsum customers, with a party of five to ten people that we usually have, we would pay any where from $10 to $15 per person at the most, including tip! But at Ping Pang Pong, we had to pay about $20 per person! Even though the dimsum was good, the higher price is not worth the wait! Next time, we'll go to Chang's or Orchid's."

Out of our large group of friends, 3 newbies and 4 vets of dim sum tagged along.\n\nWe stuck with the basics for the sake of the folks new to dim sum but their selection really isn't that big to begin with. They have all of the typical items and they do most of them well.\n\nSteamed pork dumplings (shui mai) were very good. They were bigger than average, lots of pork goodness and hints of chopped mushrooms. The pork bulges out of the wonton wrapping like they were on 'roids.\n\nSteamed shrimp dumplings (har gow) were good. The translucency made the newbies stare at it for a bit but the shrimp was fresh and there was an average amount.\n\nSteamed BBQ pork buns (char siu bao) were average. Rather typical and on the small side but the filling was tasty. The baked versions were very good and the bread almost melts in your mouth. The thin egg wash layer on the top makes it a little sticky but it probably keeps it soft instead of crusty. Both fillings were just sweet enough without overpowering the pieces of pork.\n\nChow mein came in a big heap. The onions and green onions gives it a decent flavor but it didn't have the crispy, wok/pan fried edges it should have. It went well with the steamed pork ribs.\n\nSpeaking of pork ribs, they were also given a double take by the newbies as they look more like sedimentary rock than meat. They were fine but lacked the bit of black bean sauce it usually has. There was also only a few pieces in the dish but some of them were pretty meaty. Careful of the small bones as they are cut from the rib tip ends.\n\nThe steamed shrimp rice noodles (har cheung fun) were great as the shrimp again is fresh and there were plenty of them in each piece; 3 to an order. The noodle was slick and not chewy. They are drowned a bit in a light soy sauce. The beef version wasn't as great and had little seasoning but that's probably due to being steamed.\n\nThe deep-fried glutenous rice dumpling (hom sui gok) were good. Crispy yet light on the outside, the filling was a bit small but the pork, shrimp, and mushrooms were tasty.\n\nI think I'm missing an item or two but dessert came as the sticky buns (gai mei bao) and were very good. The bread was nice and soft and the coconut and custard filling wasn't too sweet. This was a big hit at the table.\n\nNo one wanted to try the stuffed eggplants but in previous visits they were very good - not overcooked limpy and the filling of shrimp was crispy. No sight of chinese broccoli (gai lan) this time but in previous visits the dish was small and the broccoli was on the small side themselves. Didn't get any crispy spring rolls but there were average with a shrimp and pork filling. Other items I never tried are the different rice porridge, jelly fish, bbq pork and cummin filled pastries, and chicken feet.\n\nIt was a Monday morning around 11, an hour after they had opened, and it was about 60% full. The water refills were pretty steady and the carts that deliver the dim sum were coming and going at a good rate. It's at the far end of the casino floor and open to a bunch of slot machines on one side. My Sprint phone struggled to get a decent signal there.\n\nOur bill came out to about $15 per person including tip, which is pretty typical price.\n\nFrom their usual menu (and previous visits), the wor wonton soup is decent with lots of it in an order. The pot stickers were nicely pan fried, a bit doughy and the filling was okay. The grilled lamb chops were ok but they were mostly bone. The beef flat rice noodles were a bit greasy but tasty. However it didn't have a lot of beef in it."

We left the casino at 1130, and I realized I had lost my phone. We looked around the restaurant and casino for my phone, but it was no where to be found. After an hour or two, my mother decided to go back while I searched for it in the car and other places. \n\nAs soon as she walked into the restaurant (she didn't even say a word), the employees aggressively approached my mother by telling her they didn't have the phone and to stop asking because they do not have it. My mom felt that something was wrong because they were acting so defensive, so she called security to file a complaint. Her and the security looked over the table but sure enough my phone was no where to be found. About five minutes after security left the restaurant, they \"just happened to find my phone.\" It is a busy restaurant, the table was at the front of the entrance, the employees supposedly cleaned the table thoroughly, and this was over a span of a few hours. After a couple of hours, how did they just happen to find my phone especially when they aggressively kept telling us they looked and found nothing. \n\nTo top it all off, I called my phone about 30 times, yet all of the missed calls were magically erased. Also, since I called my phone so much, how did not one person in the restaurant hear or see it vibrate. \n\nObviously this restaurant has no integrity, and they only returned the phone after we got security involved. It is unlikely that a customer would return the phone after a few hours of keeping it, and it is so ironic that my phone was returned a few minutes after security arrived.  \n\nI have no respect for how this restaurant handled this issue, and I suggest everybody keep their belongings close."

Lack of a genuine greeting  3. Rushed order-taking. 4. Failure to touch the table more than once per dining experiece (cover). Management (on the floor) has not properly addressed these issues & is failing to ensuring any reasonable level of service. I recently noticed 2 or 3 other guests laughing in the restaurant while dining alone. After speaking with a couple of them, I later learned through our conversation that they were loyal customers for many years, but that the service levels are now \"laughable\". This, I am not alone in this review....I am also not hesitant to make it. Ping Pang Pong will be given one final chance to remedy this poor situation. Two stars will become 1 star if the next experience mirrors this one. There are too many other options out there....."

Alittle pricier than the hole in the walls in Chinatown but quality of the food you could taste. Get there early on the weekends to beat the long lines and get a players card for 10 percent off."

BTW, they do not accept Discover as a form of credit card.\n\nComing from a city that is very big on dim sum, Ping Pang Pong gets the job done for Vegas dim sum. Now i will admit that it is not Los Angeles or San Francisco quality, this place still offers a lot of varieties that are seen in dim sum places. They have the old fashioned feel of steam carts being pushed around while you pick your selections, and the steam foods are very fresh during dim sum service. \n\nThey also offer a very nice late night menu as a lot of their dishes resemble good Cantonese flavor. Selected dim sum is offered at night time. The rice plates are tasty while they serve up some of the Chinese favorites such as Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, steamed razor clams/scallops, Mapo Tofu, and Asian vegetables. Fried rice and noodle plates are also solid. Also, they have a special where they serve a 5 pound lobster for about $80, not a bad deal in this town.\n\nThe service here is what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant, quick and convenient, and the servers definitely know how to do their jobs well. The servers are very English friendly if needed be. \n\nAs for the bad, the wait here can be very long during lunch hours, as well as opening of dinner service. Also, if you are sensitive to MSG, do not eat here as they are definitely not shy of it. You will know with crazy amount of thirst after you eat."

If you are there for the food, it's great. If you are there to be wowed by Bellagio style service, you're obviously at the wrong place but it will work, no complaints from me.\n\nI will definitely return to more during the week to escape the holiday rush. By far the most authentic and tasty place in Las Vegas. The price is on par with those other Dim Sum joints in town but much more tastier and popular. If you're down for a quick lunch, swing right in during non holiday hours! Clean, delicious, and fast: trifecta for great Chinese food!"

I wish I'd arrived earlier, say at 10 AM when they open, because I had to wait, and it was a little bit busy for my tastes.  Service was okay, although I had to flag down a waitress or wave over a cart lady a couple of times.  The porridge with shredded pork and thousand-year-egg was superb--light, fresh and like no porridge I'd eaten to date.  I also had shrimp in rice noodle roll (slightly spicy, and there was plenty of pepper sauce on the table to turn up the heat as desired) and custard buns--silky, rich yellow egg custard just barely sweeter than the dough (I have this thing against eating once I'm full), and wished I could have tried everything.  If those aren't the most imaginative choices, take heart; I'm slowly working my way through all the dim sum offerings in Las Vegas.  I simply order whatever I see first.  So far I've tried Harbor Palace and now Ping Pang Pong--I think that Ping Pang Pong is the better of the two."

We were in the mood for some dim sum, and since I heard this place was comparable to Orchids Garden, we decided to try this place out.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't even half full when we got our table, and yet this place still lacked service. The carts came by slowly and there was barely a selection of dim sum. We ordered a few items and the dim sum was cold. It must have been sitting out for awhile, and there wasn't any new dim sum coming out. Also, it took them FOREVER to bring us the water and tea. Since we weren't getting full off of dim sum, we decided to order some food off the menu (fried rice, noodles, and string beans), though it did take us a long time to order since nobody came by our table. When we got our noodles, they were very oily. The rice and string beans was mediocre, nothing to rave about. When we got our bill, we were surprised at the total. We weren't even full and yet we ended up paying a lot. Plus, they charge for tea. WTF! I have been eating dim sum all my life, and all of the places (Portland, Seattle, Vanc BC) I have been do not charge for tea. That is BS. \n\nOverall, I will NOT come back here again. What a horrible experience. The food lacked variety. The dim sum was cold. And the service was super slow. \n\nI tried Orchids Garden a few days before, and they were 10x better than this place. More dim sum selection, service was great, and reasonable price. When we left Orchids, we were stuffed and yet we paid less there than Pings."

The problem is that the service here is simply atrocious. The waiters and busboys are not well-trained and it's clear that management does not care about providing good service.\n\nI used to come for the food anyway and ignored the service deficiencies (it's a good test of character!), but it's gotten to the point where I just can't visit this restaurant anymore because the bad service is so aggravating. The best example is how all the runners/waiters (especially at dim sum) play a game where, when they bring a new dish to the table, they just start putting the dish down even if there's no space on the table - forcing the guests to scramble to drop whatever they're eating and move stuff around before the new dish touches down. They might as well just announce that you have 5 seconds to rearrange your existing dishes, otherwise that siu mai basket is getting dumped on your pineapple buns. I even had one incident where the runner used the dish she was delivering to brush my chopsticks out of the way before setting the dish down on the table!\n\nIf you do decide you're masochistic enough to visit, the 'dragon well shrimp' and the salt+pepper pork chops are terrific. If you're into lamb stew, it's really good as well. My other favorites are their XO sauce dishes - there's a calamari one and also one with shrimp and noodles. I would avoid the ma po tofu though, as it's subpar.\n\nSide note:  If you are sensitive to cigarette smoke, this place is a no-go. The ventilation system in the casino blows all the smoke off the floor right into the restaurant. Every time I visit Ping Pang Pong, I smell like I've been hanging out with chain smokers all day.\n\nIMO, a pity 2* rating is actually very generous for this place even in consideration of the good food. The service is really that bad here."

I cannot eat the food that they actually eat in Japan and China. When I am served chicken at a restaurant that is cold (on purpose), yellow, still has the skin on, and has chopped up bones in it, I don't even want to take a bite.Fried pieces of pork that still have the fat on them do not appeal to me. A soup that is served with a huge bone in it with tiny scraps of meat and fat clinging to it does not look appetizing. In the spirit of adventure, I ate a few bites of everything, and it wasn't disgusting or anything, just meh.\n\nIn fairness, Ping Pang Pong also has some of the traditional American-y dishes you can get at your local Chinese takeout, but we were looking to branch out and try some new things. I'm not upset with the restaurant - I'm sure this is excellent preparation of Princess Chicken or Salt & Pepper Porkchops - they just aren't for me.\n\nWe also tried the singapore noodles, which were kinda like your standard Lo Mein, and some fried rice, which I thought was really good. Our final order was the wrinkled green beans, and they were also good. Overall, we mostly stuck to the noodles and the rice. \n\nOur 6 dishes and 2 drinks ran about $80, so it's higher than your average takeout place, but still reasonable. We had enough food to easily feed 4 people.\n\nThe atmosphere inside is nice - kind of like any casino restaurant between casual and fine dining.

However, there are several drawbacks to Ping Pang Pong. \n\nThe first, is that unless you get there right when it opens, you will have to wait in line. The line can sometimes take 10 minutes, but more often it will take much longer. This can be infuriating at times, because they have two sides to the restaurant and often keep people in line when half the restaurant is still empty. I understand that they don't want half the restaurant unattended by employees, but this place is so small that really shouldn't be a problem. \n\nSecond, service is hit or miss. At times, they are attentive and you don't have to wait long to get your food. But at others, you can wait a long time before you get any food, or your drinks refilled. When it's busy, you need to leave your table with your food ticket and basically attack the food servers, since dim sum is brought out on carts. If you don't then you might not get food for a while. \n\nThird, while most things are great here, especially the char siu bao (bbq pork bun) and dessert buns, there are also things which are sub-par. The most disappointing is the lo mai gai (stuffed sticky rice). While it works in a pinch, I don't recommend getting it here.\n\nAll in all, this is a good place to come for dim sum, just make sure you arrive early and are ready to attack the servers for food."

Never in my life have I been treated so poorly in a restaurant. After waiting for almost an hour. I got up and left without my food."

We've had to eat the half roast duck instead (also tasty), Kung Pao Chicken (yes I'm dating a white guy ;) We've had pretty good service everytime we've been here and also manage to get a table straight away. Most of the time we eat between 12 and 3am so they usually run out of the crispy chicken by then. Once we came at 7pm and the crispy chicken came out 5 minutes after we ordered it but it wasn't even crispy. The other 3 times it's been great. We like it spicy. \n\nDishes we don't like: hot and sour soup. It's not hot or sour... Just big. Wrinkly string beans - sounds exactly like what it is - wrinkly string beans, not the yummiest vege choice! \n\nDishes that are average: won ton noodle soup - it's also massive and has lots of veges, chicken feet - flavour is ok. \n\nDishes that we like - crispy chicken, pepper beef medallions,roast duck, Kung Pao chicken, Singapore noodles, prawn dumplings, Chinese brocolli. \n\nWill we be back?  Yes!"

We had from siu mai, pork buns, yellow cake, chicken feet, custard buns, sticky rice in lotus leaf, and many more items some included sea urchin!!  they have a great variety of items, food is hot because the carts are always walking around and you can choose what you like to eat or try.  90% of the crowd is chinese, good sign!!!

Not the greatest start, but luckily once I started eating, the experience took a 180 turnaround.\n\nLocated in the Gold Coast, this little Chinese restaurant serves up some mean dim sum.  So elegantly presented, each simple dim sum item takes Chinese dining to another level.\n\nDelectable roast pork, cooked with a nice crispy layer of skin, thinly sliced and served with shelled boiled peanuts...what?  Who would've thought of that?\n\nThen there was this super light custard made from egg whites served in a bowl and covered with a light pastry puff.  Who said dessert at the end?  We had to start with this popular dish before they ran out!\n\nI kept saying I can't eat another bite and then another cart would come by with another beautiful dish.  They are so smart.  Even if you say no, they always unveil, just to make sure you know what you are saying no to.

Fail, haha. They actually don't have a large selection of soups, but I ended up with the Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup...which was bland and the noodles were undercooked. The shrimp wontons in it however were delicious! \n\nWe also shared the night market fried rice, which had slices of beef, thai chili, tomatoes, and bean sprouts. This was sooo good! Full of flavor with a nice spicy kick to it! Another dish we ordered was the crab with sticky rice...the crab was fine, but the sticky rice was tasteless and too mushy. \n\nService was decent, but slow since it was so busy. The restaurant wasn't too crowded, but they had stacks and stacks of to-go orders sitting on the bar counter. Our waitress was quick to take our orders and our drinks were quickly re-filled...but the food took forever to come out.

When we do go out or get take-out however, it's always from 'Ping Pang Pong' (still don't understand the logic of this name choice..). He always raves how this is a really good Chinese restaurant and they cook their dishes with all the right ingredients and proportions. The pricing is very suitable too. You would assume being inside a casino, they would charge more than the actual dish is worth, but the price range is about $6-8 for a good portion of food per dish. \n\nMy dad would be the one to know all the technical stuff with what is a good quality Chinese dish and bad quality. The reason why I know this restaurant really lives up to the 'Best Chinese Restaurant' awards plastered around the entrance is because the traffic that I have seen come in and out of this restaurant, and the number of to-go orders that are bunched up on their large counter space everytime I am here. It's ridiculous! We've had to wait a good 45 minutes for our to-go order (3 dishes) to come out, so my advice is if you're looking for some take-out.. make sure you order way ahead of time of when you expect to actually eat.\n\nHad dimsum the other day and they don't have a wide variety of options but for what they do have, it's superb quality in my opinion! Really loved their turnip cake. Best I've ever had! \n\n4 instead of 5 stars is just because I wish their floor space was a little larger and had more selection of dimsum items, but as for their quality of food.. 5 stars for sure."

The prices were very reasonable for most dishes but it depends on what you order of course, which depends on what carts are circulating.  They had quite a large selection of dim sum when I was standing outside waiting in line but very few carts by the time I got in 40 minutes later.  They kept bringing the cart of overpriced specialty dishes and another one with deserts to our table but not the cart of deep fried dishes or buns.  They did bring a cart of steamed dumplings, but then it was 20 - 30 minutes before we saw it again.  Most tables were waiting for carts.  I guess they were loading them up again since we finally saw the missing carts coming out of the kitchen as we were leaving.  Also, several carts are presented when you first sit down, but after that the servers will simply pass your table by.  You have to be aggressive and chase them down unless it's the pricey cart of Chow Mien ($6.50), Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli $9), or fancy prawn dishes..  \n\nOf the food itself, some dishes were really good, most were excessively greasy, and a few were stale.  The bun with egg yolk inside tasted like it was made the day before or unfrozen.  The steamed rice roll/crepe with shrimp inside was very good but the Kalbi ribs were disgusting and inedible.  The chicken feet were very good, but the desert of mochi with black sesame paste filling (Gee Mah?) was cold.  I've never had it served completely cold before.  The egg rolls were fine.  The chewy deep fried mocha/rice balls with ground pork inside were really good and the Shu Mai and Haw Gow were fine.  They need to work on their consistency of food availability and food quality but for the price I allow more than I would at the higher prices of the Las Vegas strip hotels and the crowds speak for themselves.\n\nThe wait staff was pleasant to us, but the servers would not lift the containers to show you what was inside and gave very limited explanations.  One guy next to us had to get out of his seat to see what was on the cart and soon began lifting lids too, which is very unsanitary in my opinion.   He shouldn't have had to do that to find out what is offered on a cart.  He also had to get extra napkins for his table and for us.  On the plus side, the hostess didn't argue with us when we refused tea and asked for water instead and we were not charged for tea later on the bill either."

I suppose that they get so many people (being in Vegas and all) plus all the Chinese tourists that they can afford to do so.\n\nTheir Chow Fun is exceptionally good (I always order it and use it as a judge for Chinese restaurants). They translated it into \"Rice noodle.\" This was not as... err... random as their \"Wrinkled Beans...\" It doesn't sound appetizing, but it's name in other restaurants is \"Dry Braised String Beans,\" or something similar. Both of these dishes are good. I also tried their lamb and duck, both were good (if somewhat overpriced).\n\nTheir service is pretty good too, considering it could be a lot worse. They serve hot tea automatically like a Chinese restaurant should. Dim sum was kind of slow when I went with only 3 carts and a few waiters with trays (but again, since it was a weekday, that's to be expected).\n\nThe super high rating is due to the fact that it is literally in the middle of the casino. It's not some fusion crap that other casinos on the strip sell. Nor is it some Panda Express imitation. Nope. No longer must I take a trip to Chinatown to get my fix. I can play my Monopoly slots, place my sports bets, grab some Chow Fun with my winnings, and then lose it all on craps... all on the same floor. Now that's Vegas...."

The wait in the line to get a table and seating is not bothersome as watching the activity in the restaurant and seeing the Chinese cooks in their crisp white chef garbs before chinese woks and hot fire, all viewable in the open cooking area. These Chinese cooks whip up authentic Chinese menu! The food servers there to serve and aid in choosing from the menu and answer meal questions. Authentic Chinese cuisine, in that it is not Americanized Chinese food. From seafood, to vegetables, soups, main meat meals and dessert, it could never been any less filling. Best recommendation is to try each and every entree in the menu. In as much as I return dining in this restaurant located inside the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino of the west side of Entertainment City, I have a constant pick which you may want to try. For starters, savor the taste of Savory Minced Squab and Pork Tenderloin (served with hoisin sauce). A Provincial favorite dish is Double-Braised Scallop Hot Pot (whole seared scallops simmering in garlic oyster sauce served in a sealed clay pot) which is just tasteful. A favorite dish is the Singapore Rice Noodles with a taste of curry that reminds me definitely of SIngapore (with vermicelli. shrimp, BBQ pork, onions). Serve me Duck and it sticks in my palate even after it's off the plate into the tummy filling: Plum-Orange Braised Leg of Duck or the Cantonese Roast Duck (Half). The Lobster and Vermicelli Clay Pot steaming in broth, or the Emperor's Seafood Stew (sun-dried abalone, fish maw with supreme sea cucumber all simmered in flavorful broth) or the Manila Clams with Black Bean Sauce definitely sends me to seafood heaven. Develop a taste for the very appetizingly filling Clay Pot & Congee meals is a definite choice: Ginger Mushroom Chicken Rice or the Sausage Duck Confit Rice. For Rice dishes, I always order Cantonese Curry Beef Brisket Stew, or the Chow Fried Rice (with BBQ pork, green onions and shrimp), or the spicy Night Market Fried Rice (with sliced beef, fresh Thai chilies, diced tomatoes, bean sprouts), or Fu Chow Fried Rice (mixed seafood saut\u00e9ed in a light scallion gravy) or the Pineapple Seafood Fried Rice (which reminds me of being in the islands). A vegetable favorite is Saut\u00e9ed Lotus Root (thinly sliced in an sweet and pungent sauce), or the Snow Pea Leaves with Roasted Garlic. Highly recommend \"Dim Sum\" as it is for me the best bang for your bucks in this entertainment city! A wide array presented in rolling carts pushed around by chinese-garbed food servers all too willing for passing it on to your table from the dim sum cart. Ready for small eats that leaves you wanting more, go Dim Sum! Dim Sum dining is at lunch time. As I have experienced dining here as often as possible, see for yourself why it's been voted many times as \"one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants in America\" by Travel + Leisure magazine and \"Best Asian Restaurant in Las Vegas\" by readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal! China has never been closer at Ping Pang Pong! Ha, that's a hit!"

After a while we decided to walk over to the Gold Coast and try their buffet. While walking over I noticed the sign for Ping Pang Pong's and I remember seeing great reviews for the place. My husband was excited because he had been in the mood for Chinese food. \n\nAfter arriving at the restaurant and being seated the server came and took our order. Mind you there were only 4 of us and we decided on just a few items: The Kung Pao Chicken, Beef and Broccoli and fried rice. After we placed our order we were brought the waters that we requested. An hour later we still did not have our food. We tried a number of times to flag down our server or anyone that could tell us what was up with our food...we were basically ignored. \n\nWe ended up just getting up and walking out....\n\nSo I can't really give a review on the food but their service get's an all time low for me."

The (Spanish?) server who took our drink order did not know the name of the only chardonnay on the menu. Our meal server never returned to ask us if everything was ok. In fact she disappeared for good after our order was placed. Eventually we had to flag down some one who was serving other tables in our section to help us.

Probably the best roast duck I've had in years: not as fatty and more meaty than a true Peking Duck but delicious nevertheless.  Both HK and Macau style egg tarts for daan taat freaks.   Other dim sum very typical but well done.  A variety of noodle and rice dishes and wonderful claypots like the scallop and greens pot. BTW they also have a noodle house at this same Casino so you can try other dishes including Hot Pot.  Only small issue is the seating: too many large tables go partly occupied. In Asia, a large table would be seated with two or even three parties so you don't waste a ten seat table on just three people"

Now maybe Vegas just doesn't have too many authentic chinese restaurants but damn this was the worst dim sum I have ever had in my life! My friend took me there 2 weeks ago and well the name kinda threw me off to begin with but once I tried the shu mai... damn it was over! I didnt want to try anything else. The simplest dim sum and yet they couldnt even get it right. The beefballs were too overcooked too!  Even the tiny little pork buns were to run from. How does this place stay in business? But then again maybe they are catering to a different crowd. What really struck me as weird was the fact the place was full of asians! I mean, is this suppose to be as good as it gets in Vegas for dim sum? If so, I'd rather stop by a trader joes and pick up a pack of frozen shu mais. You will have much better luck going to the frozen food aisle at a supermarket for good dim sum. Oh one more thing.. horrible service. The employees are literally fresh off the boat! I guess thats the only thing authentic about this place, their workers! hahahaha Trust me when I say I will never come back here or recommend this to another soul.. unless i hated them and wanted to waste their money! =D"

Half a year later, I was driving around town and noticed a billboard saying they're voted the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas. \n\nSo I gave them a try. The first thing came to my mind - Gold Coast is better than I thought. After minutes of walking through the casino, I finally made it to the restaurant. It's an open space meaning people outside can see inside. The tables are placed in an traditional way and may seem to be too closed to each other if you expect more privacy. \n\nI had no idea they had a long line waiting outside. I was there for at least half an hour. By the time I left there was no line. They did have a waitress come out and ask for party size but I don't think it helped at all.\n\nIt was lunch time, so beside regular menu, they have lots of dim-sum served as well. Actually people go there just for the dim-sum for lunch. I had 9 dishes plus one dessert. (yes I ate it all by myself) Not very good, but not bad either. Also had a mushroom tofu which I couldn't finish there, it was pretty yummy. \n\nI expected the bill to be around 70, but surprisingly it was 47 after tax. Some of the dim-sum I ordered were only 2.88 and some are 3.88, not even close to the price I thought it would be. (Dim-sums are divided into two categories. Every time you get something, they stamp on your paper accordingly) \n\nI laughed when I got the bill.The pronunciation of 8 in Chinese is similar to \"get rich\". The pricing is pretty authentic to Chinese culture."

So we had plenty of water. We did however see a lot of dim sum carts pass us, but they seemed to be going to every other table but ours. You would think a table of 12 people would be easier to spot. Especially with half of use waving for service. We still are waiting as I am typing this. But I can take comfort in knowing that I will never go thirsty coming to Ping Pang Pong. Hungry maybe but never thirsty. Full of water sitting here looking at all the water glasses.

We also ordered the typical sui mai (pork dumpling), har gaw (shrimp dumpling) and fung jao (chicken feet).  Overall, I really enjoyed the dim sum here and would definitely return the next time we are in the mood for dim sum when visiting the strip in Vegas.  This restaurant is located inside Gold Coast Casino.  \n\nAnd what's there not to love about the name?  It's definitely memorable."

We had duck bbq pork ribs and broccoli at 9.95, wow that is a lot and the duck was not tasty where I would say Yummy yum yum.  The skin was not crisps.  The rubs and broccoli was good but not at that price. \n\n\nThe Sui Mai's were okay I didn't like the sesame on top of the,  the hom suy gook were good but it had a string taste of dried shrimp. The meatballs were one star, not good or even soft it s texture is like fish balls which I don't like. \n\nOne lo Mai gai, usually you get wi of the rice wrapped in bamboo leaves \n,ha gow was food.  The bbq pork steam bows and bakes were really good they were filled with plenty of meat. \n\nThe aide chow mein was lacking bean sprouts but it guess it filled my carving as it went by many times and it was was calling my name. \n\nWe got quite anew things but I didn't eat them all.  Someone told me that this was best in town, I have at it is pretty decent but they lack service.  We didn't get our water or tea until way later after sitting down.  The refills were scarce too.  Who expects service drink a Chinese place? I do... \n\nThey have people in line waiting and there was another sign that said wait here.  I wasn't sure if you need to tell them the number in your party and then get in line.  I asked the people in line but they didn't understand me.  I waited for a bit which no one showed up until five minutes later, she tells me to stand in line and she will come.  Okay don't talk to me like I am an irritating you, I just wanted to check.  Besides she sat the first two people then she came back but the people in front of us decide to sit in those two seats and they get in first. Wth... What system is that but shame on the two that didn't say anything.  Okay so there are at least 90% Asian eating but I think that there must be an Asian tour bus coming around because this place has changed quite a bit. \n\nGood recommendation from friends eh..."

Fresh and steamy dim sum is the way to go to appease our hunger! \n\nPing Pang Pong has been voted one of the best Chinese Restaurant, according to Vegas Magazine and others alike. Nearly 3 years ago, Ping Pang Pong started their Dim Sum and I am wondering why have we only now just discovered this?\n\nThe venue is located inside the Gold Coast Casino, small to medium size and the kitchen is open where you can see the chefs prepare and cook the food.  The pros about being in a casino is that they have restrictions in cleanliness and maintain proper cleaning schedule.  Having an open expedition kitchen is a plus, because it's nice to see the chefs prepare the food depending on where you sit.\n\nWe had the best of the following, Pork and Shrimp Shumai, Shrimp Dumpling, 2 orders of Sweet  Pork Bun, Dim Sum Noodles, 2 orders  Pork Spare Ribs with black bean sauce, Crab Balls and Tofu with Shrimp paste. \n\nFirst of all, every bite and taste of dim sum was so steamy or crunchy fresh that it just dissolved in our mouths! Then the service was fast and consistent with clearing our tables or refilling our beverages. \n\nPing Pang Pong is over $1 more than other places, but it is definitely worth the price mark up and hands down the best dim sum in Las Vegas!"

There's also these triangle shaped dim sum filled with beef which are amazing! It is so convenient because these carts come around to each table, filled with all the dim sum and as you select each plate, they add a stamp to your table's sheet.

When you step in Gold Coast, you will notice that its pretty much a bigger and nicer version of California Hotel. Ping Pang Pong is located past Noodle Exchange on the right side. I came here on 2 occasions and tasted the following:\n\nMinced Squab Lettuce Cups, Walnut Prawns, Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice, Asparagus and Bamboo Mushroom, Chicken Feet, Singapore Rice Noodles, Roast Duck\n\nNothing disappointed. Everything was delicious and freshly made. I like how the kitchen is open and you can see the cooks tossing the woks and stir frying the food. Also, the prices are great with every dish no less than 14 dollars. I would say this place has the best Chinese food in Vegas because it combines great taste with great value. Though its a 20 minute drive from our place, my wife and I would come here again when we are in the mood for some good Chinese grub."

The vibe is as follows: downtown, somewhere in the middle of a Chinatown - not in Vegas but more of some big port city (like NYC or SF) - duck-in-amidst bustling streets filled with shrimp merchants and trinket salespeople. Yeah- but it IS in Vegas! It's amazing how one can be transported someplace completely different just by a meal. That, of course, occurs when the meal is done right. \n\nWe enjoyed the dim sum, and thank goodness we started going back to the gym. I say this because we had a bit more of a guilt-free attitude as we looked over a packed table filled with our favorite dim sum dishes-all cooked to perfection with rustic Chinese authenticity in mind. \n\nWe started with tofu and shrimp balls, covered in hot peppers. Now, I hate tofu. My wife is very good at encouraging me to try new things, so with a little hesitation, I took a bite. Awesome! I had more, and my wife and I faced off for the last one. She won, however I had some shrimp balls hanging around waiting to be devoured, so all was not lost. We had the skinny noodle chow mein (huge portion....finished it). Amazing! For one thing, it was brought to our table steaming hot. The flavors consisted of aromatic young onion, assorted Chinese vegetables, covered in tasty fried bean sprouts. \n\nI could write paragraph on top of paragraph in order to describe the amazing tastes of each item we had, but don't have all day. \n\nI HAVE to mention those sesame balls! DAYUMMM! Not only were they the best ever, but my wife and I went into some sort of weird blissful state as we polished off both plates and washed them down with the yummy Chinese tea. We had to sit there and take it all in before composing ourselves and finally getting the courage to face rows of slots as we made our way back to the car. \n\nI also must mention the service. The staff was outstanding and kept our water and tea filled. They took the time to explain each dish in detail. \n\nOh, and the prices! Cheap! We were probably about $20 in when we were full, but continued into the $45 range for both of us because the food was that good. \n\nPing Pang Pong is the best Chinese I ever had - period, and I really hope people will take notice and place it into 5-star land where it belongs. \n\nThanks Ping Pang Pong!!!!"

Arrived on a late-evening flight and decided to order takeout. I'm an eggitarian and after looking at the menu, picked the mapo tofu from the \"Veggies and Tofu\" section.\n\nNow I realize that vegetarian and vegan are difficult for oriental cuisines, so on placing my order, I checked with the cashier. Even though the item was listed in the \"Veggies and Tofu\" section. Because belt and suspenders. I asked if the item was vegetarian and she said yes. She seemed to speak decent English so I figured I was safe. Got back to the room and started eating. Less than a minute into it, I bite into something with a chewy, meaty texture. I look closer and it appears to be ground pork or beef. By this time it's close to midnight and I don't have the energy to go back downstairs, complain, and wait for another order. Cashiers and servers should really know the menu items at their restaurants. If they don't, how can they effectively serve their customers?\n\nSo I email the casino about my experience and ask them to contact me. That was 3 days ago. Still no email. It is almost industry standard these days to place a \"V\" next to vegetarian items and a \"VG\" next to vegan items. And heart icons for heart-healthy etc. Probably takes 2 minutes to modify the menu with these identifiers.\n\nI am fairly liberal with tipping, so on takeout orders, I pay and tip when I place the order. I want my 3 bucks back.\n\nWait. I'm retarded. I want all of my money back..."

He explained that while he was new to the area having recently relocated from LA he recommended the spot over in the Gold Coast. That spot is Ping Pang Pong.\n\nSadly I got there a little late and yes there was a wait so the dim sum offerings were scant. I was told that they have dim sum all day, but by 3 there were only 5 items left. I was there with two dim sum neophytes. In the light of all of my enthusiasm they found the offerings underwhelming and ordered off of the regular menu. The spare ribs were some of the best I've ever had. In fact we got two orders. The sesame seed balls were different from the ones I've had on the East Coast but I liked them. In fact, the remaining two items I ordered were different but not bad. I'm giving this restaurant a 3 because I believe I wouldn't have been underwhelmed if I'd had more to choose from.

            "review": "Came here by the recommendation of a friend, who along with others, classified this as the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas. It was a bit tough to find, but that's expected with most restaurants in Vegas hotels. Let's skip the details and just go straight to the food:\n\n- King Du Pork Chops: Very tender for pork, but tasted a lot like orange chicken, minus the chicken part. Pretty good dish overall if you like that Panda Express takeout taste.\n\n- Walnut Prawns: Somehow every place I go to has their own spin on walnut prawns which makes them unique. Here, the batter was very thin, which is always good. Who wants to be eating more dough than shrimp? The shrimp themselves were quite large and the sauce not too sweet. One of the best walnut shrimps I've had.\n\n- Lamb Stew: Definitely not what I expected, especially for the price. This basically consisted of broth with vegetables and pieces of stewed lamb, for about $20. The lamb itself was nothing too special, and neither was the entire dish. If I took some time, I could easily make this at home.\n\n-  Tofu: I forgot which dish this was, but look at the pictures if you want a better idea. This was a pretty typical tofu dish that our veggie friend typically orders. It was full of flavour from the sauce, not too spicy, and done just right.\n\n- Hot and Sour Soup: Also pretty typical, although I feel like they made it too sour. I love the consistency of this soup, which they got just right, but everything else was just so-so.\n\n-  Veggie Noodles: I hate noodles that are way too fat, which is what you get typical takeout places. This, however, was the complete opposite. Nicely sized noodles, lots of veggies, and cooked well. Not much else to comment on.\n\n- Gobo Beef: This was definitely the highlight of the night. The dish contained probably the softest beef I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. It pretty much melted in my mouth, and the sauce just made it that much better. This is a must have if you come here.\n\nOverall, all of the dishes were pretty typical of a Chinese restaurant, with the exception of Gobo Beef. I'm sure there are better and more authentic Chinese places in Vegas, but this place was a pretty pleasant surprise in the overcrowded Vegas restaurant scene."

Panda Express is more authentic. \n\nService was horrible, food was over cooked as it tasted like it was steamed many hours from yesterday's leftovers.\n\nThey kept pushing around the same 3 carts over and over with less and less of a selection. This is as authentic as Mexican food is to Taco Bell. I feel sorry for the people waiting in a long line to get in, normally with a big wait you would expect awesome food.

            "review": "Rated as the best Chinese Restaurant in Vegas according to numerous billboards around Vegas. This means squat here on yelp. I just laugh when I hear stuff like this. I bet these come from the same people who says Olive Garden is the best Italian food in Vegas, Starbucks having the best coffee, or voting Taco Bell as having the best Mexican food. Just remember all the awards Sam Woo got, and we all know how good that place is. Anyways on with the review!\n\n@ Shrimp Dumplings (Har gau) - Good shrimp taste. Disappointing texture on the skin. Changs has PPP beat on this one.\n\n@ Pork Dumplings (Siu Mai) - This was okay. But much fresher than Changs.\n\n@ Egg Custard Bun - This is just okay. But after having the gooey and hot filling back in SoCal, this just doesn't seem that good anymore. Filing was lukewarm, almost cold here.\n\n@ Congee (jook) - Much better than Changs by far. Flavorful and hearty. If I didn't have to share with the other people around the table, this would be all mine!\n\n@ Shrimp Rolled in Rice Noodles w/ Soy Sauce - Tastey shrimp taste, PPP has Changs beat on this one by a narrow margin with a better rice noodle wrap and soy sauce.\n\n@ Oysters - Good oysters, but they need to clean it more thoroughly. Almost every bite, I got grit in my mouth. Couldn't really enjoy the oysters because of this\n\n@ Almond Covered Shrimp Balls - Yummy shrimps, but found the almonds unnecessary since you couldn't really taste it. But if you like almonds, you'll enjoy this item. Toasting the almonds a little bit would really bring out the flavor of the dish.\n\n@ Fried Shrimp + Crab Claw - Its shrimp stuffed into a crab leg and deep fried. Yum and definitely a good item to get. \n\n@ Fried Tofu - Crispy, but found it a little too salty for me. HK Star got this dish down.\n\n@ Red Bean Sesame Balls - Red bean was good, but the sesame balls is disappointing. Its the soggy and oily appetizer that reminds me what sesame balls are. Properly prepare this, and I'll enjoy this dish.\n\n@ Tea - Usually I don't comment on the tea, but tea is traditionally part of dim sum. This tea was weak. Of course, it naturally got more weaker as the teapots got refilled. So towards the end of the meal, you're literally just drinking water. Even Pho Village gives me better tea with my meal than this place. Really really REALLY disappointing. \n\n\"Ping Pang Pong\", the place with the name that sounds racist and probably won't eat there because of it (Lily D). I'm not sure whats up with Chinese restaurants in Vegas and crappy names (see Food Express Chinese Restaurants), but it just makes my head explodes. I swear they do the opposite of picking the best names, and pick the most stereotypical Chinese restaurant name they can think of. /endrant\n\nThis is more pricier than Changs, but this place is a little more consistent than Changs. Some stuff Changs is better and some stuff, PPP is better. This is probably as good as it gets for dim sum in Vegas. This will be satisfactory for most. But for those raised in CA dim sum, you will be disappointed."

I knew 10 minutes was short but you figure Chinese food doesn't take long to cook.\n\nLady says \"14 minutes\"; of course we think  \"14 minutes\" but I think she meant \"40\".  That's ok though, but my friend did go downstairs to check on our food twice. \n\nWe ordered roast duck, fried rice and pork chop.  Unless you're chasing down Donald Duck and Porky Pig, I think 40 minutes it's more than enough for \"to-go\" food.  My friend who witnessed us ordering saw a family of 5 sit down and leave by the time we came back from bingo an hour later.\n\nSo we asked to just eat our food right then and there; I mean, bingo ends at 12am and it was 12:05, 15 min after our food was supposed to be done.  \n\nGrateful to sit and eat we did.\n Minus service.  Had to wait super long before we asked for our check (just happened to be a to be a drink balance of $3...)\n\nMonday night, slow service.

            "review": "Two friends and I dined at Ping Pang Pong this week for dinner, and our expectations could not have been higher. I lived in China briefly and one of my accompanying friends is from the Philippines and her mother makes incredible Asian cuisine. So, when we heard that PPP was one of the most authentic and well-received Chinese restaurants in America, we couldn't wait to try it.\n\nImmediately, I was pleased with our server, who noticed we were ordering things without meat and asked if we were vegetarians. We said yes, and she informed us that many of the items were cooked with chicken broth, but said she'd ensure it wasn't used in our dishes. Unfortunately, we concluded that the chicken broth must be Ping Pang Pong's top secret ingredient, because we were rather disappointed in our food! It pains me to say I've had better tasting meals at Panda Express.\n\nHere's what we ordered and my thoughts on it:\n-Wrinkled Green Beans: Bland, but nothing a little extra hot sauce couldn't fix. \n-Ma Po Tofu: Good seasoning but we would have preferred a firmer tofu over the squishy one.\n-Saut\u00e9ed Lotus Root: The fact it was described as \"pungent\" on the menu should have been a red flag. It was too crunchy and the taste of vinegar was over-whelming.\n-Shanghai Noodles: We got it without the pork, and it was basically oily ramen. Big portions a plus, though.\n-Rice: Dried out and hard!  \n-Iced Chrysanthemum tea: It was akin to drinking potted plant water.\n-Fresh Coconut Juice: It was on the menu, but apparently not available. I hate it when that happens.\n\nUltimately, I was disappointed with Ping Pang Pong and don't plan on returning. Another patron might have better luck ordering Dim Sum or a meat dish, as apparently both have been praised. However, I'll stick to other establishments/fly to China the next time I want authentic noodles/have my friend's mom cook for me! :D"

Our water was refilled frequently and a food server made her round to ask every table if everything was okay.

            "review": "This restaurant is located in The Gold Coast Hotel Casino and turned out to be our favorite.  With the sad (but finally improving) state of Chinese food in SW Florida we needed to get our fill and ate here three times.\n\nThings got off to a shaky start.  Four of us ordered; Seafood Crispy Noodles ($10.95), Tea Duck, (half $12.95) Beef Lo Mein ($9.95) and Ma Po Tofu ($7.95).  It was a Saturday night and the place was busy but our order was taken promptly.  Interestingly after a reasonable wait we inquired about our food and it miraculously started to arrive, albeit one dish at a time making it seem like the order was never entered.  \n\nThe duck was cooked to a crispy goodness but was served without any dipping sauces - Hoisin was brought on request.   The two noodle dishes were large portions with the seafood noodle including ample pieces of fish, Scallops, Squid.  The fourth dish Tofu was a complete no-show with a different server offering to get it but advising the \"kitchen is slammed\", we declined and the check was adjusted accordingly.\n\nLunch here is Dim Sum served from a parade of steaming carts.  We tried some old favorites and few new things.  All was fresh and presented with care.  We tried a favorite of many Asians; Chicken Feet and now realize this is an acquired taste, however the fried rice served with it was the absolute best we ever had.  So that's how fried rice should taste!  We ate our fill and had many items with the bill for two at just $30.00.  If you've never had a traditional Dim Sum meal this is definitely the place.\n\nOne more dinner visit included our all time favorite Beef Rice Flat Noodles ($9.95) also known as Chow Fun served \"wet\".  The beef was tender and the noodles just delicious coated in the light flavorful gravy.  This dish included a few large pieces of perfectly cooked Gai Lan.  With this we had Orange Beef ($9.95) cooked just slightly crisp with an outstanding flavor.  We stuffed ourselves to help prolong the memory.\n\nThey claim to be Las Vegas' \"best\" Chinese restaurant and the fact that on each visit we were just about the only non-Asians there would seem to prove them right."

However, the Chinese restaurant in Rio has way better dim sum, and the quality is a lot better. \n\nHere's a summary of what we ordered & what I can recall : \n\nChicken wrapped in Lotus Leaf - Only get 1, and it didn't taste fresh/moist. Rice was a little hard.\nSausage Bun - Bun wasn't soft and sausage was not the greatest. \nChicken Feet - Probably the best thing we ordered - Came with 5 \nHa Gow (wrapped shrimp) - Small - We ordered 2, and 1 came with 4 pcs, and another came with 2 pcs.

I do not remember it being great as I love dim sum and will drive almost an hour to China Town in Los Angeles to have it.  And I have never gone out of my way to drive a few minutes to have dim sum at Ping Pang Pong.  Tonight my husband and I had dinner at Ping Pang Pong.  It was awful.  Not bad awful, terrible awful.  I had the Chilean sea bass which was deep fried in greasy oil.  Seems they deep fried it to avoid the fishiness.  But it did not take away the fishy taste.  My husband had the duck and it was not great.  He was hungry after the duck and we ordered the Gobo Beef dish.  it was so awful we both took a bite and that was it.  Left the entire dish.  We have eaten lots of meals and I have never seen my husband leave a full plate of food.  Service was not great but that never is an issue if the food is good.  The quality of the fish and duck and meat was crap.  The reviews for the dim sum were all pretty good, but having tried the food over dinner, there's no way we will ever go back there.  Still burping from that meal and I think I may be seeing it come back up very soon."

I guess that's part of the authenticity of this place.

We could never identify why exactly, but we decided to relocate our late night Chinese adventures to Spring Mountain Road.

The service was a little slow, but friendly. Our waiter smiled when I told him I liked them \"really wrinkly.\" My husband ordered a noodle soup.\n\nThe green beans had a nice flavor, but they were pretty greasy and some of the magic flavor (described as a Chinese tarragon) was missing. The noodles were brown from soy sauce, which isn't my preference. Plus, the noodles lacked the amount of veggies that you often get in a noodle dish. A few slivers of cabbage, some hidden bean sprouts, but no carrots. And, the noodles were a bit chewy. The noodles were no comparison to the same dish at Noodle Exchange just across the way. Everything just seemed a tad too heavy, and my husband wasn't in love with his soup. He said, \"It wasn't bad.\"\n\nI may be willing to go back for dim sum, as I have yet to try that, but for other times, I am afraid last night reminded me why we had stopped visiting."

It's located at The Gold Coast Hotel, all the way in the back. I have to give this place props for the nostalgic Chinese feel to it. Everything from the  tables to the uniforms scream Chinese. It seems so out of place at this hotel. It's as if it's in it's own little bubble.\n\nWe got there about 10:30am and there was no wait. The place opens at 10:00am. When we left an hour later, the place was packed. When we first got there, I heard the workers speaking in Cantonese, a good sign. The hostess sat us at a table and gave us one of those stamp cards. Every time we took something from the cart that they pushed by us, they would stamp the card. That's how they total the bill at the end. This is the only dim sum place that I've been to that charged for tea. With that being said, the dim sum here is a good deal compared to Hawaii, where I'm from. All the items were about a dollar cheaper. \n\nWe had the black bean spare ribs, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, stuffed eggplant, and the hot tofu dessert. These are pretty much my staples. I tend to order the same items at dim sum. I have to say the food is excellent. Everything that we ordered was on point. The shrimp in the dumplings was fresh and the wrapper translucent. The chicken feet was plump and huge. The eggplant was stuffed with shrimp paste. My favorite was the hot tofu dessert. It was silky smooth and so yummy with the ginger syrup. It was as good or better than most dim sum places in Hawaii.\n\nAs with most dim sum places, you get better service if you speak Cantonese. After the hostess sat us, no carts came around for a while. As soon as I asked for shrimp dumplings in Cantonese, the hostess waved all the carts over. Within 10 seconds, I had all four carts in front of me. My husband was laughing because he knew the drill. This happens at a majority of dim sum places that we go to."

I definitely think SF and LA has way better spots but I live in Vegas now so beggars can't be choosers."

I've been to enough dim sum places in San Francisco, Seattle, and Vegas to know that they don't have enough carts going around to service everyone in a timely manner. We got there well before 3. The cart arrived once without some of the \"basic\" selections like Shu Mai and Har Gow. We specifically asked for the items, to which they said they'd be back with them. We then waited 20 minutes, and when we asked for it again they gave us the excuse that they weren't doing dim sum anymore. It took a chat with the manager for us to finally get some Shu Mai that looked like it was under a heat lamp for an hour. I posted a picture of it so you can see for yourself. \n\nAt dim sum places you usually have to be patient and go with the flow as barely controlled chaos is how they get things done. Usually, the experience is fun and more than satisfying. However, even with that said, I'd only recommend this place if you were hard up to find an alternative."

The classical dim sum dishes (pork buns, egg tarts, shui mei) all deliver, plus they have some other unique concoctions as well.\n\nThe ambiance is great too.  I love sitting in a crowded little dim sum place, with the chatter of happy families eating together, surrounded by beautiful paintings and really great lighting!

We ordered out as it had gotten busy with all Chinese people celebrating the day after Chinese New Year. The food took quite a while (we could have eaten a lot if we had just sat down), a few dishes I wanted like egg tart, sponge cake, leaf wrapped rice, they did not have but overall their dim sum was really good. They have won best Asian 2009 which is quite a feat for most restaurants. \n\nTheir baked BBQ pork buns were so fresh and tasty I had dreams about them only 1/2 hour after eating them. Because of these buns I am willing to take a bit of abuse from lousy service. Their pineapple  buns and custard baked buns were also really fresh. Their steamed BBQ pork and custard buns were good too. Their beef rice roll was small but good and their beef balls were only OK. \n\nThey had tons of authentic style dishes that my parents would love (but I don't), in fact I will tell them to stay at this hotel so that they can be close to their own food as they always complain they can't get any decent chinese rice anywhere.\n\nI will definitely be back to try more and actually sit at a table when it's not so busy."

Checking out what the locals had to say on the subject via our handy dandy Yelp app, we decided on Ping Pang Pong for lunch around 11:30am on a Monday.  Ping Pang Pong looked, sounded, and smelled the part of a truly legitimate dim sum joint.  It was chaotic as a fleet of carts filled with hot, steamy dumplings and other small plates maneuvered the cramped, no frills, dining room that seemingly squeezed in as many tables, chairs, and diners as possible.  After a quick survey of our fellow diners, save for maybe one or two other tables, the wife and I appeared to be the only non-native Chinese speakers enjoying lunch at the time.  I took this as a very good sign that the food was authentic and of good quality and value.\n\nI have no idea what most of the actual names of items we had were, but the food all appeared freshly prepared and served at the appropriate temperature, which wasn't a surprise as there seemed to be excellent turnover of food with carts coming out of the kitchen full and returning in short order empty.  I enjoyed the fact that there were items available that I hadn't had before at other dim sum restaurants like sea snails.  The only relatively disappointing offering were the steamed char siu bao, where the filling was, surprisingly, lacking the expected flavor.  Still, it wasn't a big deal as there were so many different varieties of dumplings and small plates being served that one miss didn't diminish the overall experience.  We certainly ate our fill.  Our bill with tea, tax, and tip came out a little under $25 per person and was a very good bang for our buck.  Ping Pang Pong wasn't the best dim sum restaurant I've ever been to, but it was certainly the best one that I've visited in a long, long time."

            "review": "My family always comes here for dinner, so unfortunately we haven't tried the dim sum. Here are my reviews for the entrees we order every time we go there:\n\nSeabass hotpot: this is a hit or miss. Sometimes the seabass is awesomely delicious and sometimes I wonder if it is the same dish I ordered the last time. Overall, it's our favorite thing to order on the menu.\n\nShrimp fried rice: it's nearly impossible to mess up fried rice unless you tried really hard. In this case, you would dishona our famiry!!! The shrimp is big and not the small wimpy dried ones a lot of the other places give. Can't go wrong if you want a rice dish.\n\nRoasted duck: the skin is gooey, not crispy as I want it. There is very little meat on it. I was a bit disappointed in this one..\n\nChow fun (dry): this dish is like Asian spaghetti. I like the fresh sprouts that they use and the noodles are always delicious.\n\nTomato onion scallops: yuck! I love scallops and decided to order this for the first time. There was so much sweet and sour dressing on it, it was like drinking that thing. Ugh... I expected it to be fried scallops with fresh tomatoes and onions, but i guess I was wrong on this dish. Just thinking about this dish gives me horrible flashbacks and makes me want to gag. No beuno!!!!\n\nService: usually really quick, but a few times we waited forever or they forgot our order.. The price is fairly cheap for the amount of food you get. I noticed that you get so much more food if you take it to go than eating there. :)"

For my taste preference, Ping Pang Pong offers much better taste than any other dim sum place in LA.\nYou should go early unless you want to wait for at least an hour."

We went twice and each time it's the same thing, takes forever to get waited on, servers don't check back to see if you need anything and one time they took so long to wait on us that dim sum ended. Don't waste your time go to Changs on Decatur instead! I would not recommend unless you want subpar food at over the top prices."

            "review": "How the hell are Asians supposed to convince everyone else how offensive the term \"Ching Chang Chong\" is when we go off and name one of our own restaurants \"PING PANG PONG\"? \n\nMy Hong Kong-hailing real estate agent was visibly horrified when he found out in casual conversation that my parents and I had not yet been privy to the local dim sum experience at Ping Pang Pong (how is anyone supposed to take me seriously when I say this aloud?) in the Gold Coast casino. So while showing us detailed French doors, luxurious hardwood flooring, and expansive high ceilings, he kept peppering home features with \"shao mai\" and \"cha shao bao.\" I was sold - on the food, not the house - so not long after that, it was off to Gold Coast we went. \n\nThe casino is not the most convenient to navigate, but the restaurant sits pretty much smack dab in the middle of it, and that's where my biggest issue with it lay. The restaurant is open to the casino pits with hip-level pillars that whisper, \"Smoky Smokerson! Enter, please.\" On the flip side, however, the dim sum is solid. Every dish we hailed off the cart was well-prepared and got a stamp of approval. The xia jiao, chicken feet, congee - all good in the hood. It's just that this hood carries a bit of an eau de FUMAR!"
