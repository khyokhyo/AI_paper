We had so many things. I'm no pro when it comes to Indian food but the Tandoori chicken was the best I've had out of the ~10 other places I've been. The butter chicken was really good and their. \n\nThe service was attentive enough and they didn't make us feel like they were hovering even though there were only a couple of other tables seated. When we were unsure about something, they were patient and pleasant when explaining."

The fish was perfectly cooked, tasty and not over cooked.\nTwo minor things I didn't like:  color added to the planner giving it a bright red color.  Unnecessary in my opinion.  Second the Bhuna Gosht was a bit salty (my wife thought it was perfect), but this is something you can tell them when you place the order.\nAlso I had 2 glasses of the 2008 Perez Cruz Cabernet which I enjoyed.  Just give it time to breathe."

I tried everything on the buffet and they were all tasty. I especially loved the goat curry but I love curry in general. when u sit be sure to ask for garlic naan.  I was searching for saag paneer but it was displayed so I asked and they said they had run out but they made a small bowl for me. it was excellent as well. the buffet is only available for lunch and they temporarily close from 3-5pm so they can change for dinner. I think I found my Indian lunch buffet place. oh it's $10 which is cheaper than other places. I'd definitely be back for sure!!!"

I've only tried 2 other Indian places in my Life both were in Vegas The first was India Oven and the second was Mount Everest. India oven was ok. Wasn't a big fan of that restraunt but then again I was also younger and not interested in broadening my horizons and trying different things. Mount Everest was really good their sweet rice was really yummy but they don't serve Garlic Naan anymore :( at lunch I believer so in comes Delhi. \n\n\n\nWe came at about 2 and there were 2 parties of people besides us eating here. They have the standard share of Indian offerings my favorite was the Chicken Makhani. It's probably my favorite Indian dish. It's super good especially with the garlic Naan. Free mango lassi with check in so that's also a plus. \n\nOnly thing I will skip next time is the Galub Jamun. It's a dessert. Little balls of I think bread in a almost diabetic coma sauce. It's wayyyy too sweet for me. \n\nI hope you last Delhi India cuisine. Just put the sweet rice on the buffet line and I will be extra happy !"

            "review": "We missed the lunch buffet here by minutes, but were so resolved to try this food we stuck it out and came back for dinner hours.\n\nDelhi came recommended to us by a British friend who had spent two years in India as \"the best Indian food I've had in America.\" That's high praise from someone from the two Indian food capitals of the world (and perhaps having a palate more similar to an American than a native Indian)\n\nThe service was almost hilariously attentive since we walked through the door right as the place opened for dinner and it was all but empty.  I love a full water glass though, so even though being asked 10 times during dinner was a bit of an interruption, I can't complain.\n\nI foolishly filled up on delicious samosas at the beginning of our meal, but they were so tasty I can't be sad.  The vegetarian dumpling curry we had was surprisingly tasty.  The cashews in the sauce added such rich, thick, depth of flavor.  It is one of those dishes that makes you think, yeah, this is what I'd eat if I were vegetarian, and I wouldn't miss meat one bit.  ...But, speaking of meat, the butter chicken was an absolute dream. I've never had such perfectly cooked chicken in a curry.\n\nThe naan was also on point with a yummy chewy top and a crispy bottom.\n\n\nTo sum up how good the food was, my dining partner and I ended up eating so much of it we promptly went home and took a nap.  Bravo, Delhi Indian Cuisine, bravo."

The lunch buffet gives you tons of options, and the dishes are prepared with care and taste delicious.  The tandoori chicken is moist, the pakoras have great flavor, and the garlic naan was right up there with the best I've ever had.  I'm going back immediately to try some dishes off the dinner menu!  The most telling detail about this place is that every single customer was Indian, not surprising at all for a place of this caliber."

Food here was simply amazing, yummy and delicious with indian kind of spice level and highly authentic. \n\nWe went for lunch buffet - tried idly, sambar, chicken briyani, chicken gravy, reshmi chicken kabob, samosa, pakora, mutter paneer, navarathna kurumah aloo gobi. All the items were too good without any complaints and we truly enjoyed the whole experience. \n\nDessert - carrot halwa was too good and simply cant stop eating :). \n\nI would recommend anyone visiting vegas to definitely check this out , one of the must eat place. We will absolutely go here during our next visit."

While there were a few good dishes on the buffet, I guess the flavors weren't quite what I expected. Also, the paneer was really quite hard and the pakora was over cooked and more hard than crispy. The goat curry was quite good, but I don't think I could justify coming back for just that. They may have a lot of selections, but having less selections and concentrating on quality might be the better way to go.\n\nI must say, the service is very good and their attentiveness is outstanding.

Since we were in no position to go anywhere else and just wanted to eat indian food, we asked it to be packed and get to-go and were told we will have our food shortly.  After waiting for nearly an hour, we proceeded to walk out at which point the food was being brought to us.  After taking the food back to the hotel, we noticed there were several items missing.  \n\nExperience on Day 2 was similar with order placed for to-go and waiting for 40 minutes.  During our wait, we noticed two families walking out in a similar manner as we had on a previous day and also observed some patrons without menu and water for a long period of time.  Once again, we received the food after 45 minutes and took it back to the hotel.  AND THE ORDER WAS WRONG AGAIN!  \n\nFood quality was just above par, it wasn't anything special.  Just slightly better than the popular indian place off the strip.\n\nOverall, I will not be visiting this restaurant again."

They've got a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options to select from and their lassies are super flavorful! Dinner a la carte options are great too. Can't go wrong with anything. The only reason they didn't get a 5 star rating is for their spice level. As of lately, the lunch buffet has been getting too spicy to the point where it's difficult to enjoy the food's flavor, and at dinner time they let a bit of the spice slide a tad bit when you customize your spice level."

The garlic naan was delicious as well and complimented the meal nicely. I had a couple other things from the buffet that I've never had before and all was nicely cooked.

It is located not too far from the south end of the strip so location and accessibility was not a problem. Upon entering my first impression was that the place seemed pretty inviting. It was spacious with the buffet nicely spread out along the far end, tables nicely spaced apart so after having eaten in Mount Everest the previous day this was a welcome change.\n\nThe buffet again has all the standard items that you will find in an Indian buffet. Appetizers included tandoori chicken, vegetable pakodas (vegetable fritters) and samosa (puff pastry with potato filling). Entrees included butter chicken, goat curry, saag, rice, biryani and noodles. Desert included gajar ka halwa (carrot pudding) and kheer (sweetened rice pudding with milk). Taste wise what stood out to me was that everything was good but not great. Well the biryani and naan (provided fresh on the table) were both excellent but all the entrees were enjoyable but nothing popped out. The deserts could have been better. The gajar ka halwa cried out for some more mava (heavy cream) and the kheer for more sugar. Obviously they were made keeping the health conscience, not too sweet regulars in mind (another resturant which was full of locals). \n\nService was good, all our plates were cleared promptly and price wise it was $10.99 which is pretty much standard for Indian buffets.\n\nOverall I feel that the food surely needs a shot in the arm, but considering the overall package of location, decor, service and value for money a repeat visit is surely on the cards during our next visit."

Flavorful, very warm, aromatic, and massive in portion. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Garlic Naan, Steamed Rice, and the Aloo Tikki (Must be a minimum of $25.00 to order for delivery). Everything was packed clean and tight, no spills and no issues. \n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala is one of their most popular menu options. Now I know why. Creamy, smooth, rich, and especially spicy (if you order it as such). A perfect consistency with large chunks of delicious chicken. The tomato is not overwhelming, the spices don't rule the flavor (saffron is especially nice), and the chicken has a great consistency. I ordered a side of steamed rice, which was incredible for the amount given at $3.00. I expected a tiny bowl, but instead received an entire 6 x 6 to-go box full. \n\nThe Garlic Naan is good. The flavor is not especially strong, it's incredibly soft, not insanely chewy, but chewy enough; great to have just alone as a snack. The portion is large enough to be split between three people or more, and the texture is fluffy with that infamous smoothness of naan. I would honestly prefer regular naan, but that doesn't mean the garlic isn't especially tasty.\n\nThe Aloo Tikki numbers in two for $3.00, both about the circumference of a tennis ball. They are thick potatoes cakes, with a smooth interior and an especially crispy exterior. A little on the heavy side, but still delicious. They come with two sauces, one of which is a very close relative of a green avocado salsa, and the other a thick, sweet brown sauce. I have no idea what they are. I prefer them mixed together, because the green is especially spicy and the brown is a little too sweet. Combining or dual dipping evens them out perfectly.\n\nOverall, the meal impressed me. I'm full with so many leftovers for tonight. Everything was absolutely wonderful and the delivery was so quick and efficient. I feel horrible, by the way. I ordered delivery and gave the girl the wrong amount for a tip. I wanted to give her $6.00 instead of $3.00. *Sigh*"

The chicken curry lacked chicken and the flavor of the yogurt was overwhelming. The Saag, Samosa's and the Dal lacked flavor. The pakoras tasted stale and the rice in the Biryani was over cooked. \n\nThe only two things good were the Garlic Naan and the desert, Galub Jamun.

I'm so glad that I did because the food here rocks! (my socks).\n\nThe lunch buffet starts at 11:00am and goes until 3:00pm. It is one of the better priced Indian buffets in town at 9.99. I came in and ordered the lunch buffet. The dining room is very clean and spacious. There is a large buffet area which is loaded with tons of food.\n\nThe yelp check in offer was for either a soda or one of their house made lassi's, basically, a yogurt smoothie. They have a sweet one, a salty one, and a mango one. I ordered the mango. It was SOOO good. The flavor was very mango-ey and it was silky smooth and had a nice mouthfeel from the yogurt.\n\nAs for the food, I would recommend anything! I especially liked their chicken, all of their versions of them were super tender. The goat stew was especially tasty as well. It wasn't too gamey and the sauce on it was fabulous! There wasn't anything on the menu that I didn't like.\n\nOne thing that I thought was kinda weak was their garlic naan. I found the taste to be a little bit bland. And for their noodle, milk dessert was a little bit too sweet.\n\nService was also kinda questionable. They seemed to start out pretty slow with taking our orders and getting our drinks, and after our first round of dishes they didn't clear our plates fast enough so that we were stacking our plates on top of each other. But, they were quicker at bussing our table during the middle of our dining experience.\n\nWould I come back? Oh, you know it, because I loves me some Indian food. And the food here is delicious, fresh, and tasty. And try the mango lassi, it's really good."

            "review": "Does Delhi Indian Cuisine serve the best Indian food I've tried?  Sadly no.  Do they serve the worst I've tried?  Far from it.  Simply put, Delhi Indian Cuisine is average if not slightly above.  I went with a group of Yelpers for a Sunday lunch buffet.  I was impressed by the overall number of dishes to try and found the $10.99 price to be quite fair.  Not being one to shy away from new foods, I tried a sampling of nearly all the options Delhi has to offer from meat dishes to vegetarian.  I even tried the curried goat, a protein new to me.  It wasn't bad but there was nothing about it that made me think \"oh my goodness, this is awesome.\" In fact, that is true for basically everything I tried.  There was nothing that I wanted to push aside but there was also nothing I wanted to go back up to serve up seconds of.  I had their chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala which are typically my favorites at an Indian restaurant.  Both were good just not spectacular.  My biggest disappointment was the saag paneer.  I got a nice healthy scoop of saag but had trouble finding the paneer.  Its a good thing I like creamed spinach because that is about all it was.  At least on my plate.  I did see others with paneer on their plates so maybe I just got the bottom of the barrel before it was refilled.  At the other end of the buffet bar, I did like the desserts quite a lot.  I tried and thoroughly enjoyed the galub jamun and the syrup those little dough balls are in.  There was a rice porridge or pudding of sorts that was tasty too.  Sweet, cool and refreshing on a balmy summers afternoon.  In the end, the food was fine but the company was better."

Indian lunch buffet is one such thing, but after hearing some love from trusted friends, I reluctantly shook up our routine and tried out this new spot. \n\nIt's a large open room so it's probably a better bet if you are dining with a large group as the other better buffets are rather small dining rooms. Size of the buffet is fairly good as there were 16 hot dishes, some chutney, lettuce, cucumbers, some fruit and kheer. \n\nWe got the garlic naan, which I thought was superb and had nice garlicky flavor. \n\nAll the food was solid, but there were a few standout dishes for me. Tandoori chicken was juicy and I appreciate these aren't huge hormone large pieces. The goat curry had a nice flavor in the sauce, though quite a bit of bones to navigate., Saag paneer was solid, a bit creamier than average. The one surprise for me is the malai kofta. In the past, I've disliked this dish at other places, but I loved it here because of the texture of the kofta. I find some places it just is dry and dough-y and full of blah, but the texture of this is soft and creamy even. There wasn't a label for it, but it was sort've cut up pieces of sausage similar to a lulu kebab that had a nice gingerly flavor to it that was awesome wrapped in naan with chutney. The yellow daal was really tasty - probably my favorite one I've had in the recent years. \n\nI see that there are pics of the Himalayas and seen some mention of there being Nepalese owners and Indian owners so it's reflected in the way food is flavored. I find Napalese is less spicy and more a balance with savory and sweet. \n\nService was decent. We had our drinks refilled and the people were friendly. There's a current check in for a lassi or soda so we took advantage and got a free mango lassi which was yummy. \n\nI think this matches my usual standby in quality so I'm glad we went. I think I will alternate between this place and Mint depending on the type of Indian I feel like having."

            "review": "I wanted to try this lunch buffet since reading some friends' reviews and I went today.  It's taken the #1 spot in the Indian lunch buffet spot with one restaurant yet to go.\n\nI was there early, about 11;15, and I was the first person in the restaurant.   There soon were several other customers.  It's a very large room with lots of tables laid out well and the buffet is a large area opposite the entrance.\n\nWith a check in on Yelp, you get either a mango lassi or a soda free.  It's a good deal for merely checking in.\n\nI ordered garlic naan and then headed to the buffet.  The naan was good but I wish it had more of a garlic flavor.  For the first plate, I had chicken Biryani, a couple vegetable pakoras, a vegetable samosa, a piece of tandoori chicken, some chili chicken, soya badi, and some saag paneer.  Everything I had was very good and I noticed that almost all dishes had a spiciness that I liked.  Of these, the weakest dishes was the saag paneer.  The crust of the samosa was flaky and the filling was very good.  The soya badi was quite good.\n\nFor my second plate, I had squash, Navratan korma, chicken curry, and chana masala.  All of these were very good save the squash which was a little nondescript.  I also tried some of their raita which was good.  The chicken curry didn't have very much of a curry flavor but when the juices from the chana masala mixed with the curry juice, it became much better.\n\nFinally, I went back and got one idli and put a small amount of tamarind chutney on it.  It had a soft texture and was good.  I was a but disappointed that they had no dhokla.  I had read Christopher S.' review and I was interested in trying something different.\n\nOverall, this is a very solid buffet and moves to the top tier of Indian restaurants.  The price is now $10.99 but that's still very good considering the wide choice you have with their large buffet.\n\nService was very good!  Several times, someone stopped by to see how things were.  A woman stopped once and asked me if it was too spicy so they know that they spice their foods.  Plates were cleared before I came back each time.\n\nThis is another stop for after hiking when we go to an Indian buffet.  It's a great addition to the Indoian dining in Las Vegas."

I guess it adds variety, lol.\n**Price**\n       - Lunch Buffet $9.99\n**Ordered**\n       - Garlic Naan - I suggest requesting the garlic naan or they might give you the regular naan instead.\n       - Tandori Chicken - Flavorful as ever cooked in a clay oven.\n       - Chili Chicken - One of their Asian tasting entrees. It wasn't too spicy. A little salty from the sauce, but good otherwise.\n       - Chicken Makhani - Chicken + Curry + Butter = Delicious. The chicken wasn't too dry and the curry was as buttery delicious as ever.\n       - Chicken Saag - I prefer the makhani, but this adds variety to my plate.\n       - Goat Curry - The goat is fall off the bone tender. A must try.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice lunch Indian buffet. It's a great deal!"

Tandoori was spot on and the only thing I didn't care for was the spinach. At the end of the line there was a variety of soups and some dessert and fruit selections which were delicious! My favorite was the semiya payasam which was creamy and thick with noodles in a milky soup. The mango lassi order took some time to come out since it was forgotten the first time but it did come out right in time for desert which was fine.

I wasn't expecting my taste buds to be delighted at almost every bite or for everything here to taste good and fresh, but that's pretty much what I got.\n\nYou know the rule of thumb about places that largely serve their own demographic, right? Well, I got really excited when I walked in and saw tables and tables full of Indian customers. It's such a huge place that I'd almost call it a dining hall rather than a dining room, and there were plenty of tables available for our group. Wish the lighting wasn't so dim, but that's a minor issue.\n\nNaan, either standard or garlic depending on what you ask for (I think the garlic actually gets too soggy, but table majority ruled), is brought out by servers as needed. The rest of the food and condiments are in the buffet line. Starting from the front of the line, you run meats, veggies, and sauces/desserts. I'll just list what I had:\n\n- Tandoori chicken: the one without sauce; luckily, only a little dry as opposed to the considerably or ridiculously dry fare at other places.\n- Chili chicken: reminiscent of some Chinese fried chicken offerings, but pretty sweet, not too spicy, and definitely fresh as opposed to what you might expect at an Asian buffet.\n- Chicken curry: can't recall the flavor exactly, but I'm sure it was good.\n- Chicken makhani: aka butter chicken, definitely a favorite of mine at Indian restaurants. Rich and delicious here as well.\n- Goat curry: tasty, somewhat fatty, typical gaminess of goat meat. Delicious.\n- Chicken biryani: chicken and rice dish, kinda sour but still not noticeably dry.\n- Vegetable pakora: a fried vegetable dish, wasn't very special but could pair with something like the saag paneer\n- Vegetable samosa: fried pastry stuffed with potato, good filling to crust ratio, crunchy on the outside and warm on the inside, not too spicy if at all spicy\n- Saag paneer: creamy spinach with cheese. Didn't even pick up cheese until round 2, so I was pleasantly surprised. Tastes good until you get really full. \"Hey ma, I ate my veggies!\"\n- Navratan korma: curry with cheese and potato, or at least those were the only two I fished out of the buffet tray. Pretty tasty, worth it even for meat-eaters like myself.\n- Tamarind sauce: sweet sauce that you can dip naan in. Helped to combat the sour taste when I accidentally bit into something unpalatably sour from the chicken biryani.\n- Mint sauce: light, and as minty as you would reasonably expect. I didn't really try pairing this with as many of the dishes as I should have, but I'm sure it would complement something well.\n- Gutab jamun: I probably have had this before, but I'll be darned if any place has made it this good. Great warm dessert dumpling in a sweet sauce. Wish I'd had room for more!\n- Kheer: rice pudding available next to the fruit, mildly sweet and probably should be eaten before you overwhelm your mouth with gulab jamun\n\nI haven't gone out of my way to try every Indian restaurant around my hometown of San Jose or around the Vegas area, but Delhi Indian Cuisine serves through and through the best Indian food that I've had so far, period. The buffet thing is icing on the cake as it hardly detracted from the quality and was a tremendous value at $11. Fair warning, though: it was a busy Sunday lunch, and I don't know if the weekday holds up. Go as early as you can for freshness, perhaps?"

Everything was pretty great though; I love that they aren't as afraid of adding a little bit of heat to their buffet dishes (most places avoid heat in buffet items, for obvious reasons). \n\nI also thought the garlic naan was wonderful, hot and fresh from the kitchen. They brought it out pretty late into our meal, which brings me to the service. Not bad, but a little slow. Understandable, as they haven't been open long, and not a huge deal. Just looks like they might still be working out a couple of kinks perhaps?\n\nI would definitely return, for the buffet, and possibly for dinner if the mood strikes."

But this restaurant has one of the best Indian buffets in the US (from those I have been to). It is cheap, has a big capacity for seating, and a good variety of starters, vegetables, meat, and rice dishes. The goat meat dishes are excellent cause the meat is soft and tender (as compared to chewy meat with lot of bones in some other places). Chicken biryani is standard and not too spicy. I loved their samosas as well. I have heard that they have good lassi, though I haven't tasted it yet. This places is usually full of Indian tourists over weekend, so you may need to come a bit early (between 11 am-noon)."

The fresh Naan, that is made to order is delectable, along with the curried goat, and tikka masala was fully of flavor to compliment it all. Although the buffet has only a few choice, there wasn't any lack of flavor or quality to each choice. There is only one thing i would like change and that would be there being more light in the building. I personally like to see what i'm eating and it is awfully dim in there. Besides that, Yelpers please check this place out! It is worth your time, and belly happiness!"

If you are still coming, then keep your guest service expectations as low as possible. Because of the location and constant flow of touristy customers (who won't return in a hurry irrespective of their experience here), the management seems to care not much for customer service.

There are also no gambling machines, so that's also a nice break from the Strip. I've eaten here three or four times, and will definitely continue to eat here when I'm in town."

Naan was fresh from the oven and doughy (a bit too doughy).  Indian buffets usually have little spice to cater to the masses, but not Delhi.

I would have definitely given 4 stars for food and cleanliness, however there was a little something the servers did that I'm sure would annoy most people, but I'll get to that later.\nWhen we first came in, there were about 4 other parties seated. There was a lot of seating available and everything was kept nice and clean. We didn't get any menus, once we sat down, she told us we could start on the buffet. We didn't realize they were only offering a buffet for lunch but no problem. She also asked if we wanted fresh garlic or regular naan and if we wanted mango lassi. We went with garlic naan and skipped on the lassi just because we wanted to see how the food was first. \nWe basically tried all the meat options and many of the vegetarian options and there wasn't a single dish we didn't like. They all had incredible flavor and you could tell everything was really fresh and constantly having the temperature checked. Forgive me, I forgot basically all the names as I just started getting into Indian cuisine, Sorry! But everything was delicious.\nNow time for that annoying little quirk they had. They started passing out fliers to everyone to vote for them as Best of Las Vegas while everyone was eating. Okay no problem, I told them I would later since I mean I was basically mid-bite lmao BUT they wouldn't leave our table till I was like okay fine and pulled it up on my phone. And they were telling me how to vote and apparently you need an account to vote, then she grabs my phone, clicks login and tells me to enter my Facebook. I don't have a Facebook. Soo then she takes my phone again and tells me to create an account and just stares at me waiting for me to do it. Are you kidding me?? Ughh so I enter my info and it says it sent me and email confirmation. I kept checking and I never got an email..finally I tell her I'll call her over when I get it. She continued to check on me the rest of the time we were there and when we checked out. -_- Ya I know, I could of said no, but I didn't want to be mean. They should of never been so aggressive with it anyways. \nOverall, food was amazing especially for $23 total (including tax before tip) and water was constantly being filled. Also fresh garlic naan was definitely a plus but hopefully if we come back, they don't attack us with that crap again. If they don't, 4 stars."

My mango lassi was made in a blender at the bar so I could hear it being made from where I was sitting. The mango lassi was icy and tasted watered down. This was the first non creamy mango lassi I have had. \n\nThe samosa filling was well seasoned, not too greasy, but breading was a tad thick. It took 45 minutes for my vegetable thali to come. I am used to Indian restaurants being abnormally fast. \n\nThe presentation of the thali was classy and each dish tasted freshly made. My favorites were the malai kofta and the Kashmir sabji, the rest I could have done without. The malai kofta was well executed and the creaminess of the curry and aromatic spices worked harmoniously. First time I have had the Kashmir sabji and the assorted vegetables seasoned with herbs and spices pairs well with the richness of the malai kofta.  \n\nAll the food I had was thoughtfully prepared and freshly made. Hari seems to genuinely care about his customers. After finding out i didn't like my mango lassi he made me another one without the ice. I hope they work on getting the food out in a more timely manner because I do not know anyone that wants to wait almost an hour for Indian food."

The chicken curry seemed too watery to me.  The spices were off a little bit on the light side in all the dishes.   but overall, I liked it because of the large selection and the large dining area.  The AC was off so it was a bit muggy and uncomfortable.  Overall, based on the food alone, the taste is decent but not inspiring.  It's good because they put so much effort in it, but I don't think it's quite 4.5 stars.  I'd say closer to 3.5 to 4."

I have came to this place several times, and I return every time I get bored of bland everyday food, and I need spicy flavors with the kind of kick that jolts me out of my culinary boredom. For that effect I specially recommend the Chicken Makhani and Malai Kofta; I usually don't care much for the meat and just get the sauce and dip the Biryani garlic bread in it, then I frantically reach for my ice cold Coke (keep it close). The seasoned rice is also great. Warm atmosphere, friendly service, overall very good experience."

Very large selection of items, vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike. \n\nNaan bread is brought to your table fresh from the oven, so no problem of dried out (or missing) naan in the buffet line like some other places. As if you need another reason to wolf down warm deliciousness...ask for the garlic naan, mmmmmm, you won't be sorry.\n\nWe ended our meal with one of my favorite things - a cup of real chai tea ($2/cup). If you have  never had it, you have to add your own sweetener, which is nice because you can adjust it to your liking (and you don't have to use real sugar if you prefer artificial sweeteners).\n\nI would have to say this is one of the best Indian buffets I have had in Vegas. We left full and happy, without feeling heavy (other buffets we've visited often had overly oily items and this one did not). I also think that for the quality and selection of items, they could actually charge a couple dollars more and still be a bargain. We will definitely be back!\n\nnote to owners:  I wish you offered some kind of drink menu. Not only would customers would know what kind of drink options were available for purchase, it would also give your business the opportunity for additional revenue during the lunch buffet time."

Butter chicken was nice & creamy but the flavor was bit on the pale side. Tandoori chicken was overcooked & dry.

After seeing the great reviews, I knew we had to check Delhi out. We came for the lunch buffet on a weekday and it was not overly crowded (which was nice). The buffet was large with an extensive selection of dishes. Most of the food was quite good, with the spicy chicken curry being the tastiest option (in my opinion). They also had a large variety of vegetarian options if that is something you are looking for. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have chai tea on the buffet, nor did they have my favorite Indian dessert (the rice pudding... yum)... but apparently the selection changes from day to day, so maybe we came on an off day. The price is good for all that you get (about 11$). I must admit that I have had a better Indian buffet experience in Vegas (Evergreen... yum), but this is another great option, especially if you are a local. Happy eating, Vegas!"

What's holding me back is the casual racism exhibited by the owners. \n\nIf you don't think white people can handle spicy food, just don't ask us how spicy they want it. Make us think you only offer it one way. But that's not what you did. You specifically asked how spicy I wanted my Vindaloo. I said, \"Very spicy.\" You looked at me like I was crazy, and asked again. I said, \"Indian spicy\", hoping that magical keyword would convince you. No, instead, you looked me in the eye and asked if it was for someone else. Had I not been ready to rob a bank for a Vindaloo, I would have left right then, but, at this point, I was committed. So, thinking that you finally were going to give me what I asked, I let it go, and we ordered the rest of our stuff. \n\nThe Vindaloo's spice level was somewhere between yogurt and a milk shake. Granted, it had a fantastic flavor, as did the Tikka Masala, the Mahkane, and the Saag Paneer. The Kashmir Naan was so delicious it brought a tear to my eye, and the Galub Jamun was top-notch. In fact, the only thing missing from my night of Indian food bliss was some vague tingle; some heat to let me know that I had eaten some spices. It was just not there.  \n\nI'll definitely order from here again, but I need to know what secret code I can give you so that you'll actually put some heat in my Vindaloo."

But I don't care how decent your food is, if you can't get your food out within a reasonable amount of time when your restaurant is only HALF full, then you've got an issue and you can forget about ever attracting your customers back.

First off, India Delhi has the second largest population in the world and projected to surpass China within the next ten years. China has fifty-three ethnic minority groups. Where as India has thousands of enthic groups each with their unique cuisine.\n\nDelhi Indian Cuisine is operated by two families, one Indian and the other Nepalese. While Mt. Everest India's Cuisine on the westside is owned and operated by just one Nepalese family. \n\nI have dined at many wonderful Indian restaurant all over the US. Buffets are for the general public to sample Indian cuisine and are usually available during lunch. Dinner is always much more satisfying and my preferred way to really sample many od India's incredible cuisines. I also think it's important to know which region of India the head chef is from. It's important since the seasoning and method of cooking will be greatly influenced by his region of origin.\n\nI've pretty much have tried all the Indian buffets in town and I would rank Delhi Indian Cuisine's buffet\u00a0equal to the spicier Taj Palace on Eastern Avenue and certainly superior to Mt. Everest India's Cuisine makeshift buffet counter. My review of Taj Palace is available. Mt. Everest India's Cuisine had failed to impress me in more than one way, and I didn't bother to place a review. \n\nMy most favorite Indian buffet is served at the beautiful Royal Taj of Hanover, MD.

There were four of us and we ordered an appetizer/starter (samosa chatt), the tandoori sizzler, chicken vindaloo, chicken tika masala, rice and garlic naan. The food was all wonderful and service was good too. The only two things I didn't like is that our waiter didn't like the fact that we didn't order one entree per person (\"you realize these dishes are meant to be for one person\"), and the prices. I can get the same foods at many other Indian restaurants for less, larger portions and that have a better taste. I'm glad I went and tried it, but probably won't be back."

They won't serve you naan until you empty your naan basket even if it's the last bite left. Cmon guys I respect your sense of responsibility of not wasting food but don't give that reason to customers who need a naan. I don't want to wait for five minutes between my last bite and next bite.\nI know there might be people who waste lot of food in buffet but there must be a better way to refill Naan. You are already saving food by serving naan at table."

Not one other customer.  Normally, this would have turned us off, but we decided to give it a try because of the good reviews on Yelp.  We were not disappointed.  My Butter Chicken was not the best I've ever had, but it was delicious with the perfect amount of spice.  My nephew said that his Tikka Masala was the best he's ever had.  He lives in Vegas and commented that he has a new \"go to place\" for Indian.  Our vegetable samosa's were very nice as well, but the reason I have to give five stars is because of the Chicken Pakora's.  They had the perfect amount of breading in comparison to the chicken.  The outside was just crispy enough, and the chicken on the inside was moist, tender, and juicy.  They were without a doubt the best pakora's I've ever had, and I've been to Indian restaurants all over the world.  The service was very friendly, and quick (granted, we were the only ones in the restaurant), and the prices were surprisingly reasonable.  Give Delhi Indian Cuisine a try if you are in Vegas and want a fantastic Indian meal.  You will not be disappointed!"

I am giving it 3 stars because I expected the food to be a step above what I get in Iowa but I didn't get that. Sorry I just expect a little more when you are in Vegas. I would still recommend this place if you want Indian buffet because at $11.99 for lunch was pretty cheap for the variety you get.\n\nFood - 3/5   Thought it would be better than what I get in Iowa, come on.... it's Vegas!!!\n\nService - 5/5  They refilled our drinks often and took our empty plates."

Babygirl and I were out shopping in the area and were arguing - oops, I mean \"discussing\" our options along Maryland Parkway, and had finally reluctantly agreed to go to Jason's Deli, Turned out, the parking lot was jammed, it was unseasonably hot for October, and we were ready to turn that car around and go home when I remembered that the old soup place in the next lot over was now an Indian place. I admit I didn't hold out much hope, but it's a cuisine of which we are mutually fond, and I figured we could find SOMETHING good on the menu.\n\nYee hah! Turns out they featured the ubiquitous lunchtime buffet, so we could try it all. \nThe tandoori chicken was surprisingly moist, the butter chicken rich and tasty, and the curry had a satisfying kick. There were lots of vegetarian options involving rice, lentils, spinach, etc., which I never got to. Not because I don't like them; I happen to believe that All Foods Matter, but I had slurped up so much sauce with that nice hot naan, that I had to tap out. Did manage to wash down a big glop of sweetened carrots that made a fine, if unintended, dessert.\n\nMight have been a four star, but it's getting five because there was actual meat in all those steam table trays, not just the sauce with a few barely detectable chunks as is too often the case at Indian buffets. Good job. \n\nHighly recommend that next time you're in the area, skip the \"Deli\" and hit the \"Delhi\".\n\n(Did you see what I did there? Hee hee hee)."

A great selection, and all the food tasted fresh. I thought the particular standouts were the Goat Curry, the onion bhaji, and the garlic naan. I love goat, and of course its not easy to find in the U.S., and this is a staple on Delhi's buffet. Goat meat is a little stronger tasting than beef, and stood up to the sauce very well. The cuts of meat are on-the-bone...I wanted to dive in with my fingers and grab each piece and gnaw it clean!  The onion bhaji was crisp and tasty; not greasy at all. And the garlic naan was light and chewy and very, very fresh.\nI'm not a big fan of the bright yellow curry sauces, but my husband reported that the Punjabi curry was very good. The saag paneer was good also.. The tandoori chicken wasn't as highly spiced as I like, but it was moist enough to be tasty. Like the onion bhaji, the samosas were crisp, not soggy, and had a nice flavor. The biryani rice was a little greasy, but that was probably my only real nitpick with any of the dishes.\nThey also have the standard side sauces, raita and mint sauce. We could have eaten those all day long, with baskets of naan! For dessert, there was warm carrot halwah (very tasty, but a little odd to us; not quite a side dish; not quite a dessert); and one other selection. You'll have to look for the \"samia\" (I've always known it as \"kheer\"), at the back of the salad table. It's not labeled as a dessert, and it's right next to the similar-looking raita sauce. If you aren't familiar with it, its a sweet milk and vermicelli-noodle pudding flavored with cardamom. I like mine with more cardamom, but this was a nice cool & sweet ending to a spicy lunch :-) \nWith one soda pop, our meal for 2 was about $25, and well worth it. Rather than cook just one main dish at home, we enjoyed being have a lot of good Indian food at one meal. Oh, and the employees were very friendly as well!"

Well, this is the answer. Do not look at any other reviews because New Dehli is where you want to go.\n\nJust a few months old, it has a slew of positive reviews and -- as great as the food was (there is a mango lassi free with your check in that you MUST get) -- the pride the staff/owners put into the restaurant is apparent with every detail of the restaurant. From the decor to the menu to the EXCELLENT service, New Dehli is what comes to mind (for me, at least) when we talk about \"shopping local\".

These folks took out a space in a shopping center (plenty of parking!) and have created a truly sincere dining experience.

The moment you enter the front door, you can sense a classy vibe that is being emitted from with in. All the tables have cloth napkin and wine glass style cups that were set already. Inside the restaurant it was very well designed, tables were placed in a well designed arrangement, and in the back near the kitchen entrance there is a bar. The workers are very tentative to every customers needs. \n\nThe food that we ate was the Butter Chicken, the chicken was presented in a curry pot, the color of the of the curry is a bright dark orange, the aroma from the food smelt like tomato with the smell of curry, a very sweet aroma. At first taste, you can taste the butter, cream, curry and, tomato. The texture of the chicken was very smooth and soft. The flavor from the butter chicken gave a buttery/creamy/curry taste and a sweet smell in your mouth.\n\nThis was a first time having Indian Cuisine and the service was great, I highly recommend this restaurant."

Initially, no one was there to greet me but I was noticed quickly. I told them I wanted buffet to go and he said okay. Then proceeded to sit two groups of people, grab them all waters, and then come back and ask me if I wanted a to go box. Obviously I did so he took another 5 minutes or so to grab me so styrofoam containers. This didn't happen the second day I came in as I went straight to a waiter that recognized me and told them I wanted to-go again.\n\nThe food is amaze-balls! It's on the spicy side, so for someone who likes their curry mild beware! That's why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 3 for the service. $10 for as much as you can stuff into 3 containers is great to me! Also, I forgot to get dessert so I ask the waiter if I could get a little cup. He gave me a little side sauce cup, but he could have said no so I'll still give credit where it's due!"

It was a bit of a drive across town for us, but we would soon discover that it was well worth the drive on this blustery night in Vegas. When we arrived it was rather quite with only a few tables of guests, but we were welcomed with a warm greeting that soon transformed into thorough service in their clean space with simple yet pleasing ambiance.\n\nWe took most of our server's suggestions after talking about our likes and dislikes. Most dishes have a spice range from one to ten. We opted to stay right in the middle and asked for some separate spicy sauce to add...the spice on the side was very spicy, just the way I like.\n\nWe ordered Garlic Naan, Nepali Vegetable Momos, Butter Chicken with dark meat, Lamb Dhansak, Baingan Bharta, and Mango Lassi. Dinner also comes with complimentary Papadum & Chutney. Everything was delicious and exotic. \n\nMy favorites were the Momos and Butter Chicken. The Momos are Nepali dumplings--folded fresh and juicy with curry dipping sauce on the side...I enjoyed these dumplings very much, especially the excellent wrapper of the Momos...not too thick and not too thin.  I am used to Japanese and Thai Curry but this Indian Curry was made of different layers of spices and full of great flavor. To cool it all down we had a Mango Lassi...made with Yogurt and Mango...yummy.\n\nAccording to Yelp Reviews, lunch buffet at Delhi Indian Cuisine is must...so I am planning to come back to satisfy my appetite for Indian meals."

Check-in offer at the time of this review is still one free soda or lassi, which is a cool bonus for what is already a great deal ($9.99 lunch buffet).\n\nImpressed by the gingery Dal Tadka, and the savory and slightly sweet Navratan (veggie) Korma. They were cool with making us Roti (whole wheat) instead of regular Naan, and I thought the size of the Tandoori Chicken pieces was encouraging. Smaller chicken pieces indicate less hormones, and a more expensive bird. It's the first dish you will see on the buffet, and is a good representation of the rest of it. Quality ingredients made with care in quantity - these are some of the largest chafing dishes you will see on a Indian buffet, ever!\n\nLooking forward to the next visit, and hopefully an upgrade to a string of *red* stars.\n\nWay to go, Delhi! Keep it up please!"

The food for an Indian Buffet was very good. Their variety of dishes was nice from classic muglai to chinese, their gulab jamun are the best I have had in a buffet and believe me I have been to many. The staff was very attentive however the owner not so much. We had to wait quite a while for our naan to come out and requested the owner many times. The second time we went back was better, of course now he recognized us. Overall a good buffet if you are in the Vegas area"

I loved the food on the buffet and the fruits at the salad table were so fresh. The waiter came around multiple times during lunch to check on us.

We also started with some classic somosas. Everything was fantastically delicious. The somosas were crisp and yet fluffy on the inside. The butter chicken was a little spicy, creamy, and melt in your mouth all at once. The kofta was a dish I had never tried before but was pleasantly surprised because the curry it was in was the best curry I have had to date. We topped it off with garlic naan and life was perfect.\n\nThe servers were always attentive. This is the kind of place where you will never see a water glass empty. To be fair, we were one of two parties dining at that time (they had just opened for dinner 2 minutes prior to us arriving) so mileage may vary.\n\nFinally, the price was most definitely right.

The best Indian Buffet restaurant, place is clean service is great and food is absolutely delicious fresh and tasty.

We were greeted very warmly and shown around the dishes they served that day in buffet wich was priced very reasonably at 10.99 . Food was delicious we loved chicken Tikka masala and couple of other chicken and veg dishes ghot curry was great and we simply fell in love with the punjabi curry witch was finger licking good ( we Indians eat with hands  not forks) desserts were also good as was the service . I would definrtly recomend it to every one and will definetly eat here when I visit Vegas again"

I usually go to Gandhi but found this better for various reasons.\nThis have plenty of parking space for vehicles and plenty of area for dining. \nWe are larger group with three kids and  we need a plenty of space to move around. This restaurant was perfect for us. Coming to the food it was better than other Vegas Indian food i tasted. Since it became crowded the items are fresh that makes it delicious . I wont find anything in the heating tray for longer time. It always better to go early for buffets, we went late by 2pm so some of the vegeterian trays are already over so we got a little wait time for the foods to be prepared and filled up.\n\nThe Non veg starters are more , so you will get good options. This is typical north indian resturant so you cant expect a South indian briyani or the idly at its best. But its typical briyani and an better idly served at north indian resturant.\n\nThe butter nan and garlic nan was really delicious. \n\nAnd at that time there was option to get a Mango lassi for yelp check in, Its really very good. I found this as best among Indian resturants in Vegas."

The lunch buffet spread is impressive. For only $10.99 you have transported your palate to India aboard the royal elephants with the cool Maharajas of Rajasthan.  The staff are attentive ... make that very attentive and friendly. Pleasant ambiance, glass goblets, paper lined white tablecloths and linen napkins.  The food speaks for its self. The flavors are so pure, complex and divine. You can taste the unique blends of masala spices like cardamom, turmeric, fennel are noticeable. From the Dals, Curries, Pulaou, Tandooris to the Koftas, Paneer, Tikkas and Kormas - the food is awesome. Plus the condiment section is amazing: lime chutney, tamarind sauce, chili peppers, corriander chutney, Raita etc are just nice touches to make your experience unforgettable. Fresh Naan brought to your table bubbly, crusty and pipping hot! I love this place. I drove 17miles to get here and it was worth it. Give this place a try."

Feels more comforting personally.  \n\nMy partner ordered the non vegetarian Dahl thali **(that take out menu, in restaurant menu and online menu all have different items listed for this- be warned) **  which was a great way to try a lot of different items. They serve you small portions dishes, plus rice, naan and a yogurt dip. Such a great deal to try new food. The menu said dessert was part of it but it never came. Out of all the dishes the only one that he didn't like was the lentils. Was too salty. Not sure it that's how it's supposed to be or if it just got over seasoned. \n\n\nI ordered whipped spinach with cheese, and goat curry at a spicy level of 7 andJeera Rice( if you never had this before, I HIGHLY recommend this)  and of course garlic naan. What came to the table was different. I got a different goat dish instead of the curry ( tomato base that was thin and soupy) and with very little spice. (My boyfriend order his spice lever at 5 and was stronger than my dishes)  new cook, different cook, waiter miss heard me??  I didn't complain because I hate that at restaurants and didn't want to waste the food. It was still good ( not amazing like last time but again, I got the wrong dish) different chef, off night? \n \nNo dessert for the boyfriend \nI was served the wrong dish \n\nI still really enjoy the food I was served and my evening out but these little things kind of bug me. the servers are always nice and great, sometimes a bit slow when trying to wrap things up at the end. I'm just gonna say it was a off night.   Of course I'll be back because everything is still delicious."

They switch it up as I've been a few times and everything is done better than Mt Everest Indian.  The goat curry here had better flavor and was more tender.   When they bring you the naan, it's piping hot made to order chock full of garlic.  I went to play a poker tournament after and this definitely helped me force a couple folds.\n\nThey have a great check in deal where you get a free Lassi or soda - gotta go with the Mango Lassi. \n\nI've yet to come for dinner but if their lunch buffet is this good i'm sure it will also deliver!"

It was okay... and cheaper than other places at $9.99. But I think I would pay the extra few dollars and go a block over to Mint in a heart beat. Yes the buffet takes up length wise over half the restaurant, but what I didn't care for about this place was that it lacked variety - you have the standard Tandoori chicken, Tikka Masala etc.  But maybe it was a busy day before I got there giving them the benefit of the doubt, but I had to fish around in the sauce to find pieces of chicken and not only in the tikki masala but any dish which contained sauce and meat. Don't get me wrong I love sauce, but I like to find that there is ample meat to accompany my sauce. \n\nAlso, there was something about the ambience that felt cold - maybe it was the poor acoustics which made it feel very big and open but not in a good way or the just the set up but somehow the dining room was not overly inviting. Although, that in itself is not something that would normally concern me - hey if the food is superb I'll eat it sitting on a street corner (as used to be the case with Viva Las Arapas before they moved). Nonetheless, I thought it is something that should be noted. \n\nService was average, nothing outstanding. We did request garlic naan and they brought it. My friend asked for lemon wedges for water, they forgot, had to ask again and then they brought a plate of lime wedges from the salad bar.. maybe they don't have lemons? \n\nOn the upside I got a free Mango Lassi which was tasty with Yelp check in - so thank you Delhi Indian Cuisine for that treat. So overall I wish them good luck and I hope that they make it as I do with all restaurants that are not chains but unfortunately I am going to stay loyal to Mint for lunch buffet, and Mt. Everest as a second choice."

Pretty much all of its rivals are in little strip malls of varying degrees of  decay, so this should not deter you in terms of its exterior.  Once you step inside, the modern decor with track lighting, single open room layout, and seemingly endless linear display of offerings along the buffet line should set your mind at ease.  \n\nUpon being seated, you are immediately prompted if you would like naan bread with your buffet.  Not only should you say yes, but you should specifically request the garlic naan since the aroma alone with the freshly minced garlic and finishing brush of ghee emanating from the freshly cut bread removed from the tandoori oven is intoxicating enough to get your appetite revved up on the feast that lies ahead (refills are complimentary if you need more)\n\nAs one approaches the buffet line, the first wave of offerings include various meats including the standards such tandoori, tikki masala, and curry chicken along with some wild cards such as goat curry and reshmi kababs, which is a ground chicken meatball that seems a bit healthier than the sauced meats.   The latter half of the line offers a multitude of vegetarian offerings including saag paneer (spinach), chana masala (spicy stewed chickpeas), eggplant, mixed curry veggies, and lentils.  The third category of offerings is the carbs, which in this case included plain basmati, a spicy chicken biryani, mini-samosas (which gives you more of the flaky crust to enjoy, much like why mini-pecan pies are superior to regular pecan pie), idli (a steamed rice cake), and something I've never seen before, a spongy savory cake called dhokla, which I've read to be a beloved street snack in the southern part of India.  It has a cornbread-like consistency, a rich yellow hue from turmeric and mustard seeds, and is served with some chili peppers, cilantro, and toasted coriander seeds.  Add a dollop of tamarind, and it is a pretty addictive combo of flavors which I would have had more of had I not discovered it at the end of my meal.  \n\nI almost never have room for desserts after an Indian buffet but it is a rotating mix of gulab jamun(sweet milk balls), rice pudding, gajar halwa (carrots+milk), and a few offerings of fruit which I am always a bit wary of when it comes to buffets in general.  \n\nService was very good in which plates were cleared and water was refilled efficiently, and the staff checked in a few times to see how I was enjoying the meal.  Compared to the local competition, price point is excellent (9.99 vs 10.99 at India Masala, and 12 and up at Mint and Gandhi), quality of food is definitely in my top 3 in Vegas (Mount Everest and Taj Palace), and highlights include the garlic naan, balance in offerings between vegetarian and meat dishes,  a few unique offerings (mini samosas and dhokla), and ambiance.  India Masala is still my go-to choice for take out buffet due to quantity (refer to my review for my patented packing technique) as well as complimentary Mango Lassi with yelp check-in, but if I'm dining in, Delhi Indian is my new go-to place for quality when I plan to go on an Indian carb feeding frenzy for lunch."

None of the food tasted like it's been sitting there a while. A lot of buffets run into that problem. \n\nLunch buffet was all you can eat for $9.99. Great deal!\n\nRestaurant was big and spacious so you aren't on top of one another. Service is meh. The servers really don't know the food too well. I was quite nervous eating there because I have a tomato allergy. Server didn't know the sauces too well so I had to be selective on what to eat. Sucks but at least I was smart in my food picking. I asked the server what was in the sauce like spices and such and all he kept saying was \"it's cream based\" over and over. Like I get that but what else is in it???? At least go ask a manager or a cook?!\n\nMalai Kofti (fried vegetable balls in sauce) was my favorite part of the meal. A sauce unlike I have had in a while with yummy fried veggies in it. All around amazing.\n\nThe vegetable Samosa I expected more. The flaky part was ok but the vegetable middle wasn't what I was expecting: I just dipped it in the Malai Kofti sauce and it tasted better lol\n\nBasmati rice was simple like most places. Hard to mess up. Mixed it with some goat stew and it came out great. \n\nGIVE THIS PLACE A TRY YOU WILL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED."

Located in a small shopping plaza, it was pretty empty when our party of 7 arrived so no problems with seating. Later more families came, predominantly Indian which is always a sign of authenticity. The goat curry was fantastic. They had a wide variety of lassis including strawberry, cherry and lychee which the kids enjoyed. We ordered all of the dishes mild for the picky eaters in our group but I was happy to find that some dishes were more on the spicy side. Usually have to order extra rice and naan but the portions here were good sized and ended up with leftovers. The manager was very friendly and helpful and came to our table many times to check up on us. I had ordered a gulab jamun to go and was pleasantly surprised later when he doubled my order for free. Everyone was very happy with the food and the service. Will visit again next time we are in Vegas."

Some friends recommended this place, but didn't give any specifics on what to order. I tried the Delhi vegetarian thali- a sampler of curry dishes served with naan, rice, and samosas. Everything was good- and the presentation was quite nice. My favorites were the malai kofta and dal makhani. I also ordered the mango chutney, but didn't love it. The Thali says for one person only, but I left very full without touching the rice. The staff checked up on me often- maybe because business was slow. I would come back, maybe to try some new things or to check out the lunch buffet."

I keep coming back to Delhi and its becoming my new favorite indian restaurant in town. \n\nIt seems this place must do the majority of business during their lunch buffet because each time we have dined in the evening it's been dead. I don't mind a quiet restaurant...actually I prefer to feel like I have a restaurant all to my self but it makes me worried that somehow this restaurant is hurting. I hope not! I would hate to see another great Indian restaurant close. \n\nThe service here is great, the owner is always floating around and managing every aspect. You can tell he is passionate about his restaurant and it really shines through the service and food. \n\nThe Food\n\nChicken Tikka Masala\nAmazing. Perfect balance of cream, tomato and masala spices. Not too oily and great depth of flavor. Chicken is succulent and juicy, only gripe is there is not enough chicken but I deal with it because their sauce is that good.\n\nNaan\nAiry pockets with doughy edges and just the perfect amount of seasonings. Heavenly! Always so fresh and so darn addicting and their garlic version is a standout. \n\nTandoori \nHave tried both chicken and shrimp. By far my favorite was the shrimp. I've always preferred a shrimp tandoori anyway because there is nothing more visually appetizing than large juicy shrimp and fresh onions and lemons sitting atop a sizzling hot plate. Those sexy soft hissing and popping noises get me every time. \n\n\nMatter Paneer \nWell I have had better IMO but it wasn't bad. I think it's too forward with tomato and I'm searching for more creamy notes. Which is silly when you think about it, there is paneer in there and that should somehow be enough, maybe a touch more cream would make it better? I don't know. \n\nMalai kofta \nSauce 10! Dumplings 0! Way too dense and I like when they are shaped into round balls instead of those football shaped things. I'm totally just whining here, shape shouldn't matter but the shape coupled with how dense they were just didn't do it for me. But that sauce though! Their cashew based sauces are amazing. \n\nGulab Jamun\nAgain another too dense item but I don't hold that against them. I've experienced the same dense issue at other restaurants regarding this dessert. Maybe was cooked or sitting too long? Not sure.\n\nMango lassi\nDare I say this was made with canned mango? I hope I'm wrong here but I'm pretty sure it wasn't fresh mango. Still tasty nonetheless especially as the alcoholic version. \n\nAll in all this place is excellent. Great dishes full of flavor and wonderful attentive service. I can't really ask for more!"

Upon entrance my friend and I were greeted and shown to our table where our third party was waiting for us. The slightest details of this place were excellent; The booths were nice and comfortable, The ceiling lights: modern, The music sets the mood: calm and relaxing. \nThe customer service was great; because the three of us we're foreign to Indian Cuisine we had many question on what we were eating. The staff was very knowledgeable and able to answer our every question. \n\nThe food? It was delicious!! No complaints on my end. The Butter Chicken was very well rounded. Nice and creamy curry, soft and moist chicken; put that on top of rice and you get a wombo combo! The complimentary Papadum was something else: the bread was nice and crispy, add one of the two sauces that came on the side and you get a sweet taste (black sauce) or a earthy savory taste (green sauce). We also ordered the Sev Puri which was a whole mouth full of flavor. The house made cracker was nice and crispy topped off with what seemed to be a jumbled yet organized mess of toppings and you get a nice high note of sour and spicy and a slight saltiness. The visual representation and organization of these dish depicts what hard work the chef puts into the food before it is delivered to the customers table.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking forward to experience new flavors. Great staff. Great food. You can't ask for anything more except for food."

The prices are affordable, the location is clean and the service is fast.  We usually do take out, which I love, because the serving sizes are large. I love bringing the food home and binge watching House of Cards (or anything on Netflix). Add candlelight and the sound of rain falling outside your open window...makes for a romantic night in.

But no it was a wrong choice this time. It is the worst buffet that i ever had in US. the food waa not fresh and it tastes pathetic. \nsambar was as thick as a gravy of shahi paneer, punjabi kadi was as sour as lemon and it is super thick too with no dumplings in it. \nthen we tried kofta and its same no taste: very thich and same with yellow daal. BTW there were few more (aloo matar,corn saag) and they were equally horrible. we ordered breads and they were also not properly cooked we have to ask our server to cook it properly. Mind it we didnt had any trouble yesterday over the dinner. When we informed about our disappointed to the management they started giving diffuse excuses and just said sorry!\n\ni dont think the sorry was sincere ! \ni have grew in delhi and i know how the delhi food tastes! i am not returning back again and will not advise anyone!"

One plate was enough for me as I find Indian food to be extremely filling, even in small quantities.\n\nA few minor complaints were that the naan was thin in some parts, but very doughy towards the middle.

Of course our first question to the owner was if the meat is halal or not, and it was!! *halal alert* \n\nThe food was delicious, everything from the reshmi kabob to the warm gajar ka halwa. They had chicken tandoori (flavorful!), goat biryani, channa masala, and the list can keep going on and on. We also ordered garlic naan (including in the 10$ buffet price) and it honestly seemed to come right out of the oven! I couldn't get enough of the chicken tikka masala, and the Navrata korma (I think that's the name? LOL). The sauce (Salan) was creamy and hot. \n\nIt became obvious that this place is going to be very popular VERY soon. We talked to the owner, and he was very helpful. He told us that although the main items stay the same during the lunch buffet, sometimes the dessert (mithai) might change, and maybe the lentil curry (daal). \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was quite fancy and quiet on the day that we went... But they have a very nice setup. \n\nI'm itching to come back again! :) \n\nSPECTACULAR place!! MUST GO."

There are two sides to the buffet; one side is purely vegetarian which is nice so people don't get confused. The food itself is really delicious. I ate almost everything and I recommend it all. I also recommend getting a Mango Lassi if you're not good at handling spice. Since the food isn't made to order, you have no control over the spice levels."

Tandoori chicken was cold and dry, It got finished and was not replenished for 30 mins. Till then we were done.\nThey serve bread (naan) fresh on the table. Great. We were 4 adults. Gave us 2 naans, one garlic and one plain. We didn't know the type till we were done with the top garlic one. We asked for another garlic naan and our unfriendly waitress refused till we finished all the naans. As is in dictatorship you have to follow what the Govt says so here we have to obey with the instructions. When done, we asked for Garlic naan and for a change she smiled and left to get replenishment. We waited for as long as we could reminding her but with little success. Finally after a long wait we got the naan (1 piece) only to discover that it was not properly cooked and raw dough was coming in our mouth. Called the waitress and she quickly took our naan away never to be seen again. At that point we were disappointed and done. Paid our bill and left the place vowing to never return. \nMy wife paid the bill as me and kids were freaking out because of poor quality of management and lack of food. She complained to the manager who had following reasons. Got too many people, staff ran away, 3 weeks ago there was rain in Las Vegas that they are recovering from etc.. However we had to pay full price for the food while they all messed up.\nOur waitress was very unprofessional and would run away when before we could finish asking her a question. I had once asked her to listen patiently. She was rude or may be helpless. Did not understand hospitality and maybe had no experience. I think if she was polite my review would not be so negative.\nAs I see we paid full price for below average meal and horrible service. Will not go there again."

I started going to this place about 2 months ago , had a gigantic biryani and mango lassi , the chef specializes in the Mango lassi as far as I am concerned! Fan ever since .\nFirst time I went there for the buffet , the garlic bread , the mushroom were fantastic , not to mention the chicken and mutton .I had a feast , no pun intended . Only regret that day was, maybe  I shouldn`t have eaten that much .But by another 3 days the regret vanished and i duly returned ,this time ,they had another special variety of chicken , I am blanking on the name , but i was good , if you end up there just look and sausage like chicken roll,it`s really good . \nWhen I am not going to this one ,I am probably going to some other one :) .Imagine the embarrassment at showing up at the same buffet ,every other day ! And have to say most of them are similarly priced and probably have similar food range ,but after multiple sampling at other indian buffets I have to say that this one has more options,maybe a little bit cleaner and definitely the most spacious  in town. And would recommend it to anyone who wants to get away from ridiculously priced buffet at the big nightclub restaurants , as long as you like indian food .\nAs for the negative stuffs , the ambience could be better , i mean they could decorate the walls a little bit better and play some decent music like some upscale places.Sometimes they have hard time catching up with the demand supply thing but i guess this being a new place ,its something they can work on.And  yes sometimes ,there is just that little extra oil floating around in the nan-bread or the curries, again something they can work on .All in all ,for an indian buffet ,it`s bang for bucks. And no I don`t own the place and have nothing against any other Indian buffets."

There were some items I liked and some that I didn't, but nothing wowed me. \n\nThe sitting area is large and they can hold a good volume of people. The staff was nice, but a little disorganized. We had to let a couple people know before we actually got our naan. The ambiance is very casual and it makes for a nice lunch place.\n\nIn the appetizers, the Tandoori Chicken was cold on the outside from sitting out so long and only tasted okay. The Shish Kabob was tasty, but not one of the kinds that I could keep eating. I had a couple pieces and was done. The Samosa, I would rave about. Though the filling had a little too much peas for my taste, they were really yummy. In most samosas, my favorite part is the little end where there is no filling and the dough is crunchy, and in this samosa, all of the dough tasted like that edge piece. Simply wonderful!\n\nOne really good thing about this place is that they deliver fresh naan to your table. Other buffets have the naan cut up as part of the buffet, but when there isn't a high turn around, you know those naans have been sitting for a while. Not the case at this place, they offered us plain or butter, but we asked for garlic and they obliged. It did take a little while for the naan to actually come out after we had ordered it, but it more than made up for the wait with the quality. \n\nThe main dishes is where I was most disappointed with this buffet. Chicken Makhani was pretty good. It had good layers of flavor. Unfortunately, at they tray seemed like the chicken pieces were either very small or had been picked through by other guests. The Chicken Curry had no flavor, and I only ate a little. There were a couple of vegetarian options, which was good to see for the vegetarian folk out there. I'm not a fan of brinjal, so I didn't try that, but I did try the Chana Masala, which was decent, although, not my favorite. All in all, there was nothing super exciting in terms of the main dishes.\n\nFor desert, I tried both the Gulab Jamun and the Kheer. The Kheer wasn't sweet enough for my taste. The Gulab Jamun, on the other hand, was pretty spot on. They were nice and warm too!\n\nOverall, this buffet did not hold up to its reputation, but it was a good value for the amount of food that you get for the price you pay."

They are sometimes a little slow on bringing the naan bread at times but they always refill your water right away. We have went so many times now they ask us how our life has been going if we haven't been in a while just a overall very pleasant experience. Good food, Nice people and a clean place what more can you ask for?!"

(I've heard that chutney is English more than Indian, but I do not care: A good chutney is the perfect counterpoint to spicy Indian food.)\nThe naan was perfect. I like the garlic naan best but either way, you're winning. We had chicken vindaloo and a lamb dish. Both were terrific. Plus a full bar and they know how to pour a drink!\nThe service we had was terrific, even when (because I was stupid) I forgot to order our entrees, our wait person was patient with me and got the orders in immediately. I note that some of the reviews dinged them on this, but seriously, our service was well-neigh perfect."

So this place was the best choice to eat from the order restaurants. \n\nThe location was pretty easy to find. Although if you are coming from the side it can be a little difficult because the restaurant is hidden in the back corner. The server was pretty quick... too quick I say. She would come around and grab my bf's plate 1st before asking \"are you done?\"\n\n *sigh; honey you gotta ask if they're done before you take it* \n\nThe buffet in my case was pretty good. I like the chicken masala, to me it was good. The spinach (saag paneer but without the cottage cheese) * I think * had a little weird taste to it. The lamb dish was kinda hard and over cooked. The soup was pretty good (can't remember the name of the dish). The chicken tandoori was severely burnt and lacked spice and flavor. Samosas (vegetarian) were pretty good. They had a slight kick to them,which I liked. \n\nFrom the guys side, they didn't like it. They say the chicken  was over cooked. The saag paneer was mixed with milk and it tasted bad. The Naan was dry, hard and slightly burnt but the dessert was okay ( the guys say it was the only dish that was good because it was brought rather than made). Overall if you're not a food analyst  will love it! But if you are one then \"enjoy\".\n\nAlso the manager doesn't really care about its customers, he could have at least asked if the food was alright, instead like most business people, Money 1st (pay 1st) ask questions maybe later.... or never."

They were out and didn't replenish for 1/2 hour. Lentil soup was watery. I think the most aggravating thing was they were just plain out of items and did not replace the whole 30+ minutes I was there. They also have the nerve to kick up the price 2.00 more for lunch. You can't do that if you can't back up the price increase. This was by far one of the worst buffets I have been to. When I complained about the lack of essentials when I went to pay, there was no apology, no \"let me take the drinks off.\" Nothing. A blank stare. I will never go here again. Save your money and take it to the Mint where the food is delish and FULL buffet ALL the time."

The samosa was okay, but again the seasoning was poor and there were 2 big ones for 5 dollars, which is pricey for the quantity. \n\nIt took me awhile to get the food, and I had to get the waiters attention just to place the order. They weren't that busy, so it was disappointing. The place looks nice. The food tasted like buffet quality, and I have had better buffet food to be honest. My bill came to around 20 dollars."

They even had biriyani on the buffet line, which I am a big fan of. \n\nThe place is very spacious and has a contemporary layout with soothing music playing. It makes you feel like you are really in a high end restaurant, but you realize that it's a high end buffet with great food instead. I'm told they will offer a full bar in the near future which is unique for an establishment like this.\n\nI had no complaints. The staff were accommodating and received prompt service. I will definitely be back. \n\nI just need to work off the 20k+ calories I just injected into my body first after I take a much needed nap.

Only sad thing is that they do not consistently have kheer which is my fav. (4) service: always pretty good - water glasses are filled consistently (4) value: for $11.99, the lunch buffet is a great value - good for groups due to the large dining room (4).\n\nThis is our new go-to Indian Buffet joint in town. Sporting a good variety of items, they offer both Nepalese/East Indian flavors. The dining room is spacious and is capable of serving large groups of people comfortably.\n\nService is usually pretty good and your water glass is never left unfilled.\n\nMy favorite items include the saag paneer, chana masala and the aloo gobi. So delicious and usually always there. Their raita is nice and thick. They do not have chutney available as a condiment however the tamarind sauce does okay in a pinch. The tandoori chicken is quite moist and tasty as well. The hubs is addicted to their butter chicken and daal.\n\nTheir naan is great - loved the crispy bottom with the slight chew. Order it with garlic at no extra cost. Awesome!\n\nTheir one weakness in my opinion are the desserts. They have a rather artificial, watery mango \"custard\". This is in rotation with the vermicelli payasam which I found to be a bit too sweet and one note. I kind of miss the kheer using rice pudding and cardamom.\n\nOverall, these are minor issues to an great buffet. 4 starred review."

Whataraya gonna do? Amirite?\n\nThis place has only been opened a week or so. The service here was good. While the waiters were new and seemed untrained in the usual customer service/waiter chatter, (family owned restaurant I assume?), they were still very polite and attentive, and boxed our food to-go for us. No complaints from me, they refilled my water glass often as I slew down all that spicy curry.\n\nGood news for all vegetarians, half the menu is vegetarian based, which put me in a chipper mood right off the bat when we entered. They also have multiple chicken and lamb entrees if you're still craving the meat food. For me not actually being a big fan of curry, the food was amazing and I ate till I was beyond stuffed. I forgot the names of the dishes we selected, but I had a nine vegatable combo with mild spicy creme curry and my boyfriend had the traditional chicken curry. Both were just right in hotness and didn't leave a chalky taste in my mouth like most curry does.\n\nThe grand finaleeeee....Naan bread. mmm yes, that's right. the garlic naan bread here is so delicious I just wanted to go adopt a new puppy or something. Was so good that I got another frisbee shaped bread slice to-go.\n\nWith all that and an extra bowl of rice, the price for two was pretty decent. We ate there during the dinner hours where they gave us a menu, but they also do a lunch buffet which I have yet to try. I plan on coming back here as this place has awakened my curry craving.

I was excited to suggest hitting it up to 2 of my good friends for dinner end of business day. \n\nI arrived first and it was empty and cavernous.  I ordered a cocktail while waiting for my friends.  15 minutes went by and my first friend arrived and still no cocktail. I was the only one there!  It was forever before she finally brought my drink and when she did it was the wrong cocktail. I explained it was a goose and side of fresh lemon juice the first time. She brought out a goose and a fresh lemonade.  When I told her it was wrong she totally copped an attitude with me, then went back to the bar only to make another wrong cocktail which was goose and a lemon soda!   When I told her she got it wrong yet again she told me she's never had somebody in there like me and she started yelling in her native language to another of her associates... and clearly it was about me lol  \n\nThen someone came out of the kitchen, we believe it was an owner, and started accusing her of stealing keys.  It turned into an all out screaming match in the middle of the restaurant.  I mean take it outside!  The cooks even came out of the kitchen to get ring side seats, eagerly awaiting the blood shed.   Our friend finally arrived in the midst of the insanity. It was like an episode of cops was unfolding before our very eyes.  We exited the establishment post haste.  \n\nUnfortunately we never tried the food but the ambience or lack there of leads me to want to leave a negative star rating, but I have to give it a one to post.  Needless to say it's erased from my bookmarks forever!  I was ashamed it was my suggestion in the first place. My friends definitely applauded me for the stellar recommendation lol"

            "review": "We came here for dinner and ordered from the regular menu, as buffet is only available during lunch. Appetizers were generally priced at about $5, and entrees range from about $11 - $15. So it is a little pricey, but the portions were generous. We ordered vegetable pakora, saag panner, tandoori chicken, and aloo gobi. We also got a free Mango Lassi for our Yelp check-in, and complimentary Galub Jamuns for dessert (served warm)! My husband and I were both full by the time we left, and we had enough left over for lunch the next day. \n\nThe food was absolutely delicious and the staff was very nice. There place was pretty empty, only about 5 tables were occupied, so the staff was very attentive - asking if we needed more water, and checking to make sure we were enjoying our meal. \n\nI'll definitely be coming back here - only next time I hope I can make it for the $10.99 buffet lunch!!"

            "review": "Funny enough, I thought I knew all the Indian restaurants near UNLV. But this was new. The exterior is unassuming enough and fits into the surrounding businesses like a leaf on grass. But once you enter inside it looks pretty nice and clean. What I noticed was how big this place was. My go to place for Indian is Everest, but my friend told me to try this place and I did.\n\nThe service is quiet but friendly and very quick. I give the food a 3-3.5 star but the service moves it over.\n\nOk, stop your yammering Andrew. What about the grub? The food is actually spicier than most other Indian restaurants I been to. The butter chicken is probably the tamest entree there. Well, that and the pre-requisite tandoori chicken. My favorite go to is always tandoori chicken and goat. And that's what I went for. The tandoori chicken was pretty dry. I wasn't sure if it was the Hoover Dam drought effects but i shrugged that off and notched it against Delhi. The goat is very tender and tasty. The butter chicken is very delicious. I also had the other spiced chickens like curry. It was good but not memorable enough for me to remember much about that foul. The eggplant was cooked well but man oh man it had some spice to it. A bit too much for a rather bland vegetable if you ask me. Sometimes the veggie is best left natural with a bit of seasoning. To me, this is one of them.\n\nMy regular rice pudding dessert was a bit different, it had vermicelli noodle bits in it....glass noodle for the noodlers out there. The fruit and desserts were minimal. If you like sweets, they had this glutinous ball that was swimming in honey water. Sweet and delicate. Try it.\n\nI did not eat the different varieties of rice there but it looked good enough. The nan bread was brought out piping hot and had garlic and cilantro in it. It was fresh and tasted great, especially after dipping it in the butter chicken sauce.\n\nAYCE lunch was about $10. There is quite a variety but I think I will stick closer to home and go to Everest.\n\nBusiness seemed pretty slow so I hope it was because we lunched at 1:30.\n\nI will mention one more thing. There were a little too many black things in the rice pudding. Maybe 2. Imma tell myself that it was some sort of spice. It wasn't a bug. I rubbed it on the table and it was more like lint. A bug would break apart. The better half thinks it's spice so I'll go by that. She did notice that it had quite a bit of it on the tray as well. I am Chinese but an extra added bonus of tiny bug is persona non grata."

The alcohol was a nice addition and did not overpower the sweetness of the lassi. For my main course I had the  Kadhai Paneer and enjoyed every bite. My wife had the Chicken Xacuti. I'll let her write about that in her review (she liked it). We shared the kashmiri naan and used it to scoop up the great food. \n\nWould love to come back for the buffet.\n\nSide note, be careful in the parking lot, there was a taxi that flew by us not once but twice and darn near hit our rental car. :\\"

There are lot good things like customer care, light Hindi music, interior etc.,. One thing which I didn't like is the lack of cleanliness in the restroom (actually it was in too too bad shape to say the least) but I will not reduce the number of stars because they deserve another chance on that.\n\nOn the food side had goat biryani liked it, had tandoori chicken super liked it. Today I have ordered chilly chicken looks good I am sure it will taste great!"

There are white tablecloths with white paper tops, and lots of booths. The menu is varied with lots of choices for vegetarians and those looking for healthy food. My fish curry had some serious capsaicin authority, and I had ordered it as a 3 spiciness on a scale of 1-10. So if you don't appreciate spicy food, order it mild, mild, mild. My vegetable samosas were spiced perfectly, but my son would have complained that they were too spicy. I really liked the buckwheat roti (like a pancake)."

The stuff's addicting, like crack well not really. Why didn't I know about Indian food when I was going to school.\n\nAnyways Delhi Indian Cuisine is the latest Indian restaurant in my rotation. It's located in a plaza on the NE corner of Flamingo and Maryland between Toys\"R\"Us and Albertsons. Of course you have to do the lunch buffet I think it was $10.99 which is about the same price for everyone else, you might find someone doing it for $9.99. The food here is delicious, not my favorite for taste but maybe a close 2nd with the other business one block over. Forgive me but I don't know what all the dishes are but I love the green stuff, the orange stuff, the reddish stuff, and the chicken stuff. Nah I'm kidding, almost but I'll pretty much eat everything they have to offer, the tandoori chicken, the chicken tikka masala, the chilli chicken, the goat curry, the saag paneer, the garlic naan, the gulab jamun, etc. Well almost everything, I still haven't tried the chow mein yet.\n\nIt does seem like it can hold a lot of people, you could throw a party,  and it has been very busy each time I've been there. They have booths and tables. Customer service is alright they do seem to be shorted handed and do take a while to do thinks like getting the garlic naan.\n\nThey have check-in offer of a free soda or lassi. Each time I've been there I've asked them for the lassi but they've yet to brought be one. Good luck on getting your. Dammit I see that a lot of you are getting yours."

My wife and I had dinner off the standard menu and we asked for several dishes and we know indian food. How do we know indian? We were taught by an Indian from Goa who knew many dishes and taught us how to cook northern, delhi, goa, and southern styles. My wife has cooked indian, made the paneer, made the yogurt, crushed the spices, everything. So we know how it should taste and the regional spices.\nSo what did we try?\nWe had vegetable samosa chaat with mint sauce and tamarind d sauce. They also brought papadom.\nWe then had Rogan Josh, Navratan Korma, Goat Vindaloo, Mutter Paneer, plain parathas, and plain basmati rice. Every dish was authentic and provided in nice portions.\nThe dinner was capped by galub jaman which was very light and fresh and the syrup was light and sweet.\nIf you like indian, you won't be disappointed. If you want to try it, they will scale the heat from 1 to 10...don't be afraid it will be too hot!\nThe owners are one family from Nepal. We were served by Krishna and Ashmati who were informative and met our wishes exactly.\nI love indian food and this restaurant is incredible...please, just go!"
