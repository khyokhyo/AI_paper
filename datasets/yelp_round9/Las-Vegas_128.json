You really can't go wrong with anything you order I have had chicken, steak, and seafood. Breakfast is also good and the posole. Prices are fair and it's a good little spot if you want to get out of the strip a bit and enjoy some good Mexican food and yes I am Mexican"

Not only did we get free seconds on the bean dip and salsa, we got free soup too! He also hooked my boyfriend up with a flavored margarita instead of the regular house kind. They also helped me with certain Spanish words and answered all of my annoying questions! Lol! We even got our picture taken and printed on a free coupon! \n\nThe food was excellent! No complaints what so ever! \n\nThe restroom cleanliness was about a 4 out of 5."

Let me stop and say that the waiter was extremely friendly and on top of every aspect of our meal. We ordered a Margarita and waters with the Table side Guacamole for an appetizer. this was probably the best guacamole i gave ever had. The meal also comes with not only your entree but you get sopa de fideo with every combo plus beans and rice, My grandma used to make sopa de fideo before she passed and it tasted just like her.  memories!!!  \n\nOkay so now that my review has turned into one long run on sentence I will just finish by saying the meals are huge, tasty and fairly priced, I definitely recommend this place if you like Mexican food and great service."

Maybe because I told him I was going to split my meal with him and he felt bad. Hehe. 3  of us ordered the beef machaca. Our plates were left clean. Two others prefers huevos rancheros.

Damn who still does that. Had a regular and mango margarita. Margarita craving fixed. \n\nGot the guac as an app. A must. They mash it up table side, so you pick the ingredients. No onions for me. I had the chicken taco, tosdada,and enchilada combo joint. Wow! My girl had the bean burrito and beef taco combo. Said she liked it (Was her pick to eat here since she said it was the best). Tons of stuff on the menu. All this for $55 and my girl had 2 margarita's too. Definitely good.  \n\nThe only complaint is that the decor is a little old, but I like the mom and pop hole in the wall type places. I also ate wayyyy too much and it felt like a rock was in my stomach all night."

Festive colors adorn the outside of the building, and inside there were a lot of Mexican decorations and murals. Very loud and very crowded with lots of Spanish speaking folks, so I was hoping that meant the food is good--and si, it was! Traditional Mexican dishes and drinks abound, and our server Jonathan was most friendly and patient with our numerous questions about the definition of some words on the menu and the food. I decided on the Carnitas Michoac\u00e1n, which is pork marinated in oranges and spices and listed as \"the best carnitas in all of Mexico\", and I gotta agree! I really enjoyed the flavor and tenderness of the meat and all of the accompaniments--awesome! The portions were quite large, so most of our party did not finish their meals, but I totally wolfed mine down--lol! I also had a jalapeno cilantro margarita to go with my meal--woohoo, spicy and refreshing! We will be sure to visit again when we're in Vegas!"

I look so forward to the chips, salsa, and bean dip that is served when you are seated. Usually it is AMAZING and I dive in like a maniac! Today the beans were hard and dry, just not good at all.\nChips and salsa were still good though..... just a bad day for the beans I guess.\n\nToday, my husband and I shared the Parrillada de Marisco. A huge platter of shrimp, crab, fish, and rice.\nA very good value for $45. \nThere was shrimp prepared different ways, butterflied and fried (which was very tasty) bacon wrapped (wasn't my absolute favorite) shrimp in enchilada sauce (very good, especially when eaten with the fabulous rice in the center of the platter)\nThere was not a lot of crab. One bunch of snow crab legs... they were nice and sweet though. \nA large Tilapia filet in a butter sauce, which was very good. \nWonderful creamy rice piled right in the center of the tray.\nThen on the side they serve an amazing queso and warm fresh homemade tortillas!\n\nWe accompanied our Parrillada de Marisco feast with a couple of shots of tequila, 1942 and it was FABULOUS!!! Pricey tequila shots, but good!!!"

I have been here four times now and ordered something different every time. the chilaquiles are amazing as well as the fajitas and the albondigas taste homemade! Juan was our server tge most recent time. He was VERY attentive which i truly appreciate especially since it was the middle of the lunch rush. I never even had to ask for a drink refill because i had a fresh drink before i reached the bottom! The amuse buche is tortilla chips salsa and homemade refried beans. These beans are as good as my own mothers but dont tell her i said that! This is the only traditional authentic tasting mexican restaurant i have found since moving to LV.\nI reccommend the chicken mole. The sauce is rich and thick and frafrant with spices.

The decor is bright and fun with a cheerful atmosphere. \n\nThey have an extensive menu with a nice selection of seafood. I've tried the orange roughy and the camarones a la diabla but my go-to is the red snapper. It's a whole fish served fried or in garlic sauce with rice, salad and french fires. You can sub for beans or veggies. I usually do, it just doesn't feel like fries are the best option for this meal.\n\nThe guac is good and they serve a habanero salsa with a nice kick. It's not the standard salsa that comes to the table with the chips and bean dip, but if you request it they are happy to comply. There are no taps at the bar and the bottle selection is limited. The beer is not the main attraction at this bar, it's all about the margarita."

We were initially provided with chips and their home made red salsa and also a bowl of refried bean dip. The salsa was well seasoned and the beans were addictive. We ordered a hotter salsa (because that's how we roll) and were brought a green salsa--whew! Fabulous and very hot.\n\nWe ordered the Mexican Pizza appetizer with a side of roasted jalape\u00f1os and grilled onions. Both were so delicious -- we highly recommend!

But alas, after almost 3 years in sin city and my search for a great Mexican spot has finally ended........and although i cant pronounce the name of this joint, it is delicious! and not over priced! Make sure to get the guacamole! (SP?)  Hand made to your taste, right at your table, just how it is suppose to be made! I have only been there on one occasion and it was packed, which is understandable, however i don't enjoy eating in overly crowded restaurants (which is the only thing holding back from a 5 star rating)"

We were hungry from a day hiking so we also ordered a guacamole  appetizer.  The guac was prepared table side to our taste, also excellent.  I ordered a coca-cola steak ala Mama Cielo, surprisingly it wasn't sweet at all just incredible juicy.  My adventurous choice paid off.\n\nThe service was exceptional.  The server came by, without asking and refilled my drink whenever it was empty (which was often - did I mention 100 degree weather in Las Vegas and hiking).  They also had a musician singing and playing Mexican love songs, surprisingly at the correct volume.\n\nIf I lived in Las Vegas, this would be my number 1 Mexican restaurant."

I've been going to this place for years now but as I've grown older I've grown to appreciate the amazing food they offer.\n\nThe chips, salsa, and beans they offer as soon as you sit down are always so delicious that I have to limit myself lest I spoil my appetite (I'm not fancy - I've just always wanted to say \"lest\"). If I'm particularly hungry I order the Nopalitos as an appetizer. I absolutely love cactus and the way that it's cooked with onions and peppers is amazing and it's healthy!\n\nI've had the shrimp cocktail, which has never let me down. The shrimp ceviche is one of my favorites as well. On hangover days I like to go in and get the Fideo soup (I have tried the menudo - I wasn't a fan). And nothing cures a hangover like a Michelada! The ones offered here never disappoint! The margaritas are also very good, as well as the Corona Margaritas, but the mixed drinks I've found are way too strong.\n\nThe one dish that I actually had to send back was the Mole. Call me spoiled but once you've tried my mom's mole, nothing compares. Mine was too sweet and the meat was too chewy. I sent it back and got a shrimp cocktail.\n\nI guess this place just depends on your taste. Amazing for something things, not so great for others. Try it anyway."

The parking was wide open, we were seated immediately and as I was excitedly anticipating, we got our chips - salsa - and beans. The chips were good, fresh. The salsa was very good for me but my BF prefers salsa with a little kick. The beans... well... they were OK, a little salty, but add salsa to the beans and a wonderful treat. \n\nThe menu is HUGE! It took me a while to go through everything and make a decision, I finally decided on the 2 taco combo (beef tacos) and he got the beef enchilada with green sauce combo. While snacking on the chips they brought out a soup.. I wasn't expecting soup, I still don't know what kind of soup it was but it was OK. About 2 minutes after the soup came, our meal came... The food looked good, plates were hot, that's always a good sign. \n\nNow the meal... I took a bite of my taco and it was... a taco. The beef was lacking flavor, it was almost like they didn't season it while cooking, every Mexican restaurant I have been to has always used a combo of onions and other veggies/herbs to season their meat.. it just seemed.. blah. The rice was good, a little on the salty side as well and I usually put salt on everything, I like salt, but it was too salty for even me. my BF and I swapped plates to try each others dishes and his was very good. His beef was good, and it was the same type but since his food was covered lightly with enchilada sauce... i think it helped it out. I used some of his sour cream and the salsa and fixed up my taco.. not amazing but it was good. \n\nAll in all, I am happy we got to try it and I would come here again but I would definitely order something different. I will give Amigos Tacos a try next time and hope that their menu isn't as costly as it was here... over 5$ for guacamole..? Not worth it. But the main reason I will come back was the service, everyone was very friendly, our server paid attention to our table and once our drinks were half empty they had fresh ones on the table..."

Coming from the San Francisco area, where good Mexican food is hard to find, this place was a step up with chips and great refried beans served right up, nice Mexican decor, and excellent service.  I started with their Cadillac Margarita with Patron Silver.  Nice size goblet and a nice buzz that lasted the meal.  My girlfriend ordered the \"Vampiro\" which tasted like slightly alcoholic cool aid.  We sent it back and immediately had it replace with a delicious pina colada.  I had read about their Chile Colorado, a new york cut into pieces in a red sauce(gringos need not worry about it being a spicy sauce) to which I added their flavorful spicy sauce and that did the trick.  I ordered the flour tortillas (I believe they are freshly made, as it tasted that way to me.)   My girlfriend ordered the Mexican combo beef taco, chicken enchilada,  and chile relleno ( The beef taco took first place, chili relleno second, I found it delicious on a taste test, and enchilada a distant third.  Finally, always in search for the authentic churro, it was done right served with small decorative flowered whip cream flowers to dip in.  It was crisp and not overly sweet.   Overall I give this place a B+, as their chili colorado good have been better, perhaps make it bit more flavorful.  Nevertheless, as Mexican restaurant goes from where I am from, this place any day."

It's sad when the bell peppers have more flavor than the meat.

It honestly looked like they threw some pulled pork on the sizzling plate and tried to pass it off on me. \n\nThe only plus was that the tortillas were freshly made.\n\nI forgot what my friend ordered but when I asked him how his was he just shrugged his shoulders and said, \"It's ok I guess\".\n\nThe service was great and the waiters were very friendly.

Perhaps you've had them before--a pulsing, salivating tingle on the back of your tongue that flows into the mandible and EXPLODES with pent-up desire, thereby forcing a car's driver to delete an entire day's schedule and head for a Mexican eatery.\n\nAh, life.\n\nThe play? A west side joint called Bonito Michoacan. A cute little corner casita on Chinatown's edge, right where Twain kisses Decatur like cousins on a third date: roughly, rudely with nary a care of red lights. I parked the Crown Vic LX with leather interior by the entrance and strolled inside.\n\nPretty empty, but not surprising since it was only 3:30. I sidled by some clucking hostess stand chiquitas and bee-lined it to the bar. Two small screens showing sports and news glowed brightly in the gloom. Baseball on one and something about an airliner that disappeared on the other. I sat at an empty stool while a lassie two places down promptly turned her back to me, feigning interest in the sweaty boys of summer.\n\nA barmaid with gorgeous eyes asked if I wanted a drink and menu. I said yes to both. She brought me a Corona and chips and I ordered sopitos and a carne asada burrito. I ate hot salsa by the chipful as I watched investigators futilely attempt to explain what happened to an airplane. Every once in a while I would glance at the slender back to my left, its owner uninterested in the life of an accomplished and handsome young man. Such a shame. I could have made her so happy. If only for a night....\n\nWhen my half dozen sopitos arrived I promptly dumped my salsa all over discs that held ground beef, chicken and steak. Occasionally I would dab said discs into sour cream or guacamole. What a delight. I asked for Tabasco and doe eyes placed it before me. She saw me eyeing shelved tequila bottles and asked if I wanted a shot. I told her I was unable to drink a single shot because one had an unbreakable habit of turning into six. She laughed and hip swung to the kitchen. When she returned she had my entr\u00e9e.\n\nThe carne asada was tender and plentiful, its cavern lightly browned with properly melted cheese. I ordered more beer and enjoyed the rest of the dish. By this time Slender Back had paid her bill and snorted her way past, but not before the barmaid had bade her farewell. \n\nOh, well. Sometimes I'm just too good looking for people.\n\nAnyway, my bill was twenty bucks and I left five for a tip. Outside I looked at the kissing cousins and turned the car homeward, but not before reminding myself to come again soon. Only next time I would not allow Slender Back to get away so easily...."

I feel it is safe to say Bonita Michoacan is my favorite. \n\nI came here with my family last weekend while they were visiting from out of town. They were told of Bonita Michoacan by a waiter they met at an IHOP who also works here also.\n\nWe were seated quickly upon arrival even though it was a Friday evening and we were a party of five in this busy restaurant. We did not have to wait long before chips and salsa were brought out. Then we were also brought the sopa de fideo as is customary at the Michoacan restaurants. As were were looking over the menu and munching on chips, we saw another table which had ordered the fresh guacamole. We thought it looked good and ordered it too. I'm glad we did. It was chunky, creamy, fresh and just the right level of spicy. That was a nice way to start our meal.\n\nFor my entree I ordered pollo al cognac. One bie and it quickly became my favorite chicken dish any where. The plate was huge as was the chicken breast though I could not really see the latter. It was a large breast grilled to perfection while maintaining tenderness then smothered in a sour cream sauce with mushrooms, onions and a touch of cognac. I am a sucker for sour cream and mushrooms so this was just awesome. I would go back and order that again for sure.\n\nThere are only a few small things I take issue with at Bonita Michoacan. They are the margaritas, the salsa, and the sopa. At least on this occasion. I ordered a house margarita and that is exactly what I got. My issue with it is that it taste like a premixed syrup like the ready made stuff in the grocery stores. It is very sweet and I don't care for that. The salsa was Ok. It had good spice but then there was a bitter after taste. Possibly from dried chilies being used. And finally the sopa was kind of salty. I realize it is soup and soup is salty. This was just a bit much for a couple of us in my party. Aside from those things that I'm just nagging about, this was a primo spot for dinner and we were all glad we tried it out."

Chips and salsa were awesome, but the beans weren't right.  I'm not sure what it was about them, but they weren't as good as at other places.  Others in my party had the chicken burrito and the chicken sopas -- both of which were reportedly great! \n\nService is super speedy -- they are quick and that includes taking your plate as you shove the last bite in your mouth and bringing you the check while people in your party are still finishing up too!  That's better than waiting for the check in my opinion though!"

We got the tableside guacamole (made fresh, to order, pretty good, but no tomatoes) and it was quite an amount, more than most other sides of guacamole I've gotten.  We (me and three guys with appetites) didn't even finish it.  Of course, that may have had something to do with the HUGE portions that came our way.  One of the guys got fajitas (I think shrimp) and all his fixin's took up a full third of the table.\n\nI got nachos with carne asada...mmmmmm.  A huge plate, piled high.  I think I only got through a third of it before collapsing.  After lunch (lunch at 4:30...this is what happens when you wake up at noon...) we went down to Fremont Street for a couple hours, and even nachos after fours hours sitting in a car were soooo goood...."

It seemed we had multiple people waiting on us and making sure our drinks & chips were full. I appreciated that, a lot. Pretty cool that they were all having each others backs and truly their focus was on the guests dining experience. \n\nWe ordered different varieties of the usual Mexican flare so I won't go into details describing it all. Everything was delicious and we were all happy with our food. \n\nOne thing that I thought was pretty awesome and makes me want to go back for my birthday....they had a few people with birthdays while we were there. They make a HUGE spectacle with singing to you, complete with a sombrero and a free shot of tequila down the hatch!

Just take note, 1st round of homemade chips, bean dip & salsa are complementary, additional orders are 2.99, but we were a party of 12 and there was plenty.\n\nAfter checking out the menu I went with Zitacuaro - 2 enchiladas in a Verde sauce, I picked chicken for my meat, and I have to say these enchiladas were great, the corn tortilla I believe was homemade, it was perfectly cooked, the chicken was shredded and it was moist and very good tasting, however they season/marinade the chicken was delish!

Just two years ago when my husband and I discovered it just blocks from the Rio Hotel and Casino, we were thrilled to have a great Mexican meal so close to the strip.  When we ate there in November we thought the food was not the same quality that we had just a few months before Then my daughter and I tried it in February and it was worse.  I ordered the steak Fajitas.  They arrived on a cold plate, not sizzling like they normally do.  There were 9 small pieces of beef, three small pieces of onion and 3/4 of the Fajitas consisted of bell peppers.  The Fajitas were flavorless.  No seasoning, just cooked meat and peppers.  What a disappointment.  We noticed on the menu that if you want more chips and salsa, you must now pay $2.99 for them.  What a ripoff since the bowl of chips is small and was about  1/2 full.  Ricardo's is at the corner of Decatur and Flamingo and I hear it is better thanBointo Michoacan."

In Hawaii we have Mexican Restaurants but none are as good as this one. I was amazed at how authentic the food was because it really felt like home. The atmosphere was great and the service and employees were friendly. I hope to go back one day to eat here again.\n\nFINAL JUDGEMENT: \n5 STARS-----Customer Friendliness \n5 STARS-----Taste of Food\n5 STARS-----Restaurant Appeal \n4.5 STARS-----Pricing (Well worth the cost) \n4.5 STARS-----Cleanse \n\nAVERAGE 4.6-4.8 STARS but Ill give it a 5 STARS simply because its too good to be missed."

The green enchilada sauce is amazing, as well as the citrus marinated carnitas. I had some huevos con machaca tonight (breakfast for dinner!) and it was great! Oh! The flour (have not tried the corn yet) tortillas are very good. \nMargaritas are made with fresh squeezed lime juice rather than a bottle or gun of sour mix. Very tasty.\nThe chips are very disappointing and so is the salsa. This is the only reason I could not rate it 5 stars.\n\nService:\nThis is some of the best service I've seen in a while. The staff (bus staff included) truly want to make sure that you have a great time and love every minute.\n\nAtmosphere:\nWhile the typical Mexican restaurant theme is the basis for the atmosphere, it is done well and does not feel \"cheesy.\" Pretty quiet most of the time, but can get loud when busy (of course).\n\nCan't wait to go back!"

I'm on a loose sort of \"diet\" (very strong word), I'm really trying to avoid Mexican food joints as they are very hard to eat semi-healthy at. \n\nAs I stared hard at the menu searching desparately for something I could call \"diet\".. I did notice they have a diet section, but all the food sounded bland and too well diety for my taste. I decided to try the lunch special called chicken #9 ($9.99 with soda). It rocked! It was chicken marinated in garlic, spices, chilis and it was full of flavor but light on the spice (just my style). It was served with guac, rice, beans, and tortillas (hardly diet food, but just noting you could eat this as a full calorie dish as you desire). Some of the best grilled chicken I've had in awhile... yay for a mexicn place that has something on the menu not full of lard !"

The menu is extensive, with items you don't see at every Mexican restaurant, many of which are specific to the Michoacan region.\n\nRight away, you'll notice the salsa and bean dip are great. Next, you'll notice the appetizer soup is flavorful. Then, you will certainly enjoy your entree, almost all of which are memorable and tasty. What's more, if you get the tableside guacamole, you won't be disappointed.\n\nAs a vegan, I'll say you can't beat the veggie fajitas. Probably the best veggie fajitas I've ever had or heard of anywhere, which are an interesting and delicious assortment of vegetables, served up with homemade tortilas, flour or corn (you can't go wrong either way).\n\nFor out of towners, this place is located conveniently about 5-10 minutes west of the Strip and, seeing how it is miles ahead of any Mexican restaurant at any casino, it is worth the short trip."

Both were edible and had a good amount of meat but didn't have much taste even after I drenched them in salsa. The crunchy taco was a little greasy. I actually thought they'd be more like street tacos since that's what I'm served at the sister restaurants.\nMy husband got the Carne Asada Burrito, but he had them add cheese and mole sauce which they gladly did, it was okay, but was still missing something...especially some heat (spice).\n\nI won't be going back, especially since there are so many better mexican restaurants."

Customer service is what can take a restaurant to another level but they lack that here. \n\nNot friendly, no eye contact, they don't smile and seemed annoyed being asked for normal requests. We politely asked for more chips and for our drinks to be filled. They brought more chips but didn't bring more salsa or beans for the chips?  \n\nThey forgot about our fideo soup and asked us if we ever got it and we told them we never did. They ended up bringing the fideo soup out with our meal.  It became uncomfortable asking for service from waiters or waitresses that simply don't want to be there or help you.

The pricing is affordable and although our waiter was useless the bus boy was great.. we are new yorkers so we know good service.. TABLESIDE GUACAMOLE IS THE BEST!!! & peach margaritas come with real peach slices, it's the best snack place!! Fish tacos weren't life changing though.Tableside guacamole that is so good. Ceviche was one of the best I have had. I thought the food was all good. Equivalent to lindo michoacan. The service was friendly.Bonito Michoacan really is a diamond in the rough out here on The West Side. It may not seem special on the outside, but the food inside is worth the drive.The enchiladas here actually do have taste. The chile relleno is also a good choice. I could even tell the salsa was homemade.It's good Mexican comfort food here, and the food shouldn't be disappointing.great mexican place good service, homemade tortillas, freh table side guacamole, good music, good margatitas! I am very pickey when it comes to Mexican food due to being of Mexican decent and enjoy finding the \"real thing\". Bonito Michoacan is The Real Thing.....love the food, atmosphere and the people. It's a great place to eat or just go and have their delicious margaritas."

That time we enjoyed the meal very much and planned on going back again for a special occasion. This time in no way resembled the previous experience. I had the # 1 combination of chile rellenos, chicken enchilada, and a beef taco. The rellenos was covered in some generic tomato sauce and was bland tasting. The cheese was very stringy and tasteless. The enchilada was so-so and the beef taco was almost Inedible. Beef was dry and the taco shell was hard as a rock. My date had a green chile burrito that had big chunks of pork instead of shredded, the chicken taco also had big chunks of chicken instead of shredded, and her cheese enchilada was basically a tortilla rolled up with sauce and cheese on top. She didn't care for any of it. She also ordered sopapillas to be served with our meal, and they showed up 15 minutes after the entree. When we asked where they were the waitress said they were \"cooking them fresh\".The bean dip was also bland and the chips were stale. Being a Specialty Room Chef in Las Vegas for over 20 years, I know good food. My hunch is that management has sourced cheaper product to cut cost and the quality dropped immensely, or the kitchen staff totally changed and doesn't produce the same quality as the staff from last year's visit. Lastly the table in our booth wobbled and we felt like we were sitting way to low, with the table height up to chest level because of the worn out seating. Also the music could drop a few decibels. It's not a nightclub. Needless to say I would never go back. Chipotle or even Taco Bell would be a preferred dining choice."

Immediately we were greeted at the door and a booth was found for the two of us. We ordered our drinks, and then chips and bean dip and salsa (which we did not both particularly care for) sat in front of us. The fideo soup was simply amazing, and was complementary as well. She ordered the carnitas plate with beans and rice and guacamole. 10/10 for that. I ordered the Pollo Al Cognac. 10/10 has well. The carnitas was better in my opinion, but both dishes were extremely flavorful. We took our dessert home with us since after the beans, fideo soup, and our meal we were absolutely stuffed. I ordered the cheesecake burrito and she ordered flan. She said the Flan was good. I personally do not care for flan at all, so I did not try it.\n\nFood - 10/10\nService - 8/10 (merely for the fact they sat the menu down in front of us and literally 20 seconds later asked us what we wanted.

Plus, they're really good at singing happy birthday :)\n-My fiance loves beans and was really excited to see they served complimentary beans with their chips and salsa. A nice touch and one I have never seen before in a Mexican restaurant\n\nCons:\n-The food was OK. I got #16 (two hard chicken tacos, all rice) and I enjoyed it, although the tacos were a little small. My fiance had a combo plate as well (hard beef taco and enchilada, all beans) and did not like the enchilada's red sauce.\n\nAll in all, the restaurant was alright and if I was in town again I might consider coming back."

She passed the empty sweetener bag test with flying colors!\n\nFirst. my dinner came with fideo soup.  It was very good with less of a tomato taste than I'm used to getting.  There was more of a chicken stock flavor.  For the main course, I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo, two cheese enchiladas heated in a red mole sauce with a chicken breast, refried beans, rice, and some lettuce shreds and a dollop of sour cream.  The mole tasted a bit sweet at first but then I got the undertones of the other spices and the richness of the mole came out.  The chicken breast was good.  It was seasoned in any manner so I gave it a good shower of Tapatio.\n\nFor dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  I guess fried ice cream is just something that comes out of the freezer.  I don't think anyone \"breads\" and fries the ice cream in real time anymore.\n\nI was very pleased with my visit.  I was of two minds about where I was seated.  Two men were having a loud discussion (argument?) about politics in Spanish and the one had enough tecate to not know how loudly he was talking.  However, I could have been sitting in another part of the restaurant where there was a crying baby.  I think it was better where I was.  \n\nThis was an enjoyable dinner!"

It was already passed 10am when we realized that McDonald's would stop serving breakfast at 10:30am! I decided to google some Mexican restaurants and voila'! This place is close to the Las Vegas new strip. I had the machacado plate and he had the chorizo with cheese plate. Everything was great, the customer service and the price. I will definitively be coming back here every chance I can when in town. I am from Texas and it's sad to say the food here is better than some back home. Now, you know!

There was a spoonful of beans on the side and a fair portion of rice. Typically when we order and pick up we get the lunch special which includes one order of being dip and chips and a drink.

There was some noise, which I assume was intended as music, but which sounded more like drunk UNLV students celebrating a basketball victory.\n\nService - Quick and disinterested.  In fact, quick is an understatement.  The food appeared within less than a minute, and was obviously pre-cooked and sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen.\n\nFood - Awful, awful, and more awful.  The tortilla chips were not fresh.  The guacamole had so much lime juice that it was nearly inedible (and I LOVE guacamole).  The soup tasted like equal parts dishwater and vinegar, with a thimbleful of ramen noodles thrown in.  My beef burrito had chunks of beef (God, I HOPE it was beef) that appeared to be boiled soup meat, although the tortilla was fresh.  Even the rice and beans tasted acidic.  The portions were small (no Woody Allen jokes here, please), and the prices (by Mexican restaurant standards) were no bargain.  Don't get me wrong - $8 for the guacamole and $10.50 for each Margarita is not ridiculous in and of itself, but by the time the check came I was thinking they should have paid me to eat here."

I salivate just thinking about the place.  Spouse loves the chicken verde as well.  The freshness of the ingredients ... tomatillos that were not out of a can ... indescribable.  The refried beans is like silk going down.  One of my all time favourite restaurants ever.  The owners are truly nice guys who really make one feel at home.  Go there.  Tell them I sent you."

There are a lot menu items to choose from, even some that are very traditional Mexican. \n\nI had the Carne Asada which was very tasty, cooked perfectly and with the homemade tortillas were fantastic.\n\nNora, the bartender, had great service and made a really good margarita. \n\nI would recommend this place to anyone in the Vegas area."

Carnitas are stiff and smell like old feet, bland chicken tacos, bland enchiladas. Only positives were the shrimp which were decent at best and the homemade tortillas but what good is a tortilla if there's nothing tasty to put in it. \n\nIf you're from la or sf skip and save your Mexican for cali. If you're from Vegas go anywhere else. There's no way it can be worse than this."

It starts out with soup that tasted like freeze-dried Lipton noodle soup. None of the 3 of us ate it. We took our waiter's recommendations, and although he was efficient, he was not right.  We ordered from the Specialities, and 1/3 was good: the camarones a la cognac. Booths were too short for the table. The live music-1 guy- was okay for free, but sang American songs, which did not contribute to the Mexican atmosphere. Subsequently, 2 of us went to El Nopal restaurant in Vegas, which was excellent, and proves Vegas does have good Mexican restaurants!"

It's been excellent every time.\n\nService is outstanding.  Quick friendly seating, attentive waitstaff, and an eagerness to get everything right.  I once had a dish that wasn't as hot as I wanted and they fell over themselves to please me -- getting it exactly right the second time.  I don't eat onions.  No problema.  I want extra sauce, or sauce on the side, or extra jalapenos.  No problema.\n\nMy latest visit, with my good friend Andrei, was typical.  I had a monstrously large Caldo de Pollo (Chicken Soup) as a dinner.  Wonderfully ample white meat chicken -- at least a breast, maybe a breast and a half.  The cilantro was fresh.  The other spices delicious.  My friends garlic chicken was similarly spectacular -- even without the red peppers he's allergic to.  All the chips, salsa, and guac that you could want.  And a price that left money for our main purpose -- playing poker.\n\nI love variety.  And Las Vegas probably has more Mexican restaurants than any city, including Mexico D.F..  Even so, a trip to this city always includes a trip to this restaurant -- so sure am I of getting a high quality, reasonably priced, delicious meal."

Super friendly staff, waiter started us out with a sopa de Fideo that was outstanding perfectly flavored broth. I couldn't make up my mind so I created my own combination plate of a carne asada sope and a chicken green enchilada. I also ordered a mangonada margarita the best margarita I have ever had."

If you are a seafood lover you must try the fish enpanada with their creamy sauce on top. If you are into steak their new York strip with cilantro sauce is very good. Hubby and I really enjoy the Oyster with ceviche on top (they are not stingy with the shrimp). \nWe do birthday dinners here ALL the times because we love the atmosphere. \nFor birthdays the waiters and waitress get together and do a band like show for the birthday person, love it!\nThank you guys for a pleasant experience we will see you soon"

We ordered not long after that and were eating quickly. I noticed that the menu items are cheaper than at the other locations (combination meals average $11.99, as opposed to $14). The food was marginally better than other locations, I think.\n\nI would love to go back to this location, though, because the service was phenomenal.

We stood awkwardly waiting while people piled in doing the same. \n\nGot seated in a cute booth. Fun decor. Lighting hurts. Ceiling fans make for a strange strobe light effect. Maybe a special for Halloween? \n\nService is terrible - possibly the worst in Vegas. Our \"server\" was Israel (so says our receipt). Forever to greet us. We probably were 1/3 way done with complimentary chips (the salsa is hot, the bean dip with is excellent) before he remembered to ask someone to bring water to our table. We ordered cocktails. They came out separately. By about ten minutes. \n\nOrdered an appetizer (ceviche - pretty okay). Israel came by to ask for our entree order. We said we wanted to wait for our appetizer before we ordered our entrees. It had been a while. He gives us an \"oh yeah!\" Guess he forgot that too. \n\nOrdered our meals. A table sat down after us. They got the included soup and chip refills AND entrees before us. We had to ask for included soup - from I'm assuming a food runner - he was hustling though! \n\nOur busboy had our meals boxed for us before Israel came by to see how they were. \n\nFood was okay (pollo al cognac). Not worth going back for, when such terrible, neglectful service is \"provided\". Definitely not worth the price though. \n\nHowever, shout out to Domingo, our hardworking busboy who kept our water full and table clean. The server could learn a thing or seven from his work ethic and care for guests. \n\nSucks it's so close to home, but I'd say it's worth the drive for ANY (maybe even Bell of Taco) other mexican food in the area."

Moving right along..\n\nBack to Bonito!\n\nGreeted by a friendly gentleman and escorted to our table, my eyes scanned the room to observe the typical, I mean traditional Mexican themed decor; vibrant colors, cheesy artwork, and no Mexican restaurant would be complete without \"football\" on the telly. My party and I giggled at the music selection throughout our entire meal, it went from Latin Country, to Latin Classic Rock, and my all time favorite, Latin elevator music. I have saved the best for last though folks when it comes to the decor at good ol' Bonito Michoacan..THE MILLIONS OF CLOWNS EVERYWHERE!\n\nWhat's up with clowns amigos? I just don't get how creepy clowns and puppets dangling from the ceiling tie in to delicious home made guacamole and sizzling, cooked to perfection fajitas. The clowns didn't sit well with me, but luckily their food did! (*round of applause from my stomach*) \n\nIn any event, this fine dining establishment earns 4-starts on the Kim-scale-o-food-places, the fifth lacking for, well, it's no real mystery here: the clown decor (ok and I don't fancy the location either).\n\nGreat job Bonito, I'm not positive you would be the first place I would pick should the mood for Mexican food strike again, but you're for sure in my top 5!"

The servers were so friendly and checked on us often. If it weren't for them I would have given 2 stars.\n\nThe meal started off with chips, salsa and bean dip. The bean dip was ok but the beans really had no flavor and were very runny. The salsa was horrible.  It was also watery thin and had a weird flavor. After what I heard about this place I was excited to try the salsa but I prefer a chunky fresh salsa and this tastes like something from a can.\n\nThen came a cup of Fideo Soup for us. This was tasty and it had a lot of noodle in it. \n\nFor my meal I had the #4 which consisted of a cheese enchilada, beef taco and a bean tostada with guacamole. Blah blah blah! The enchilada had barely any cheese in it and the sauce they put on top was as nasty and weird tasting as the salsa. The beef taco was cute and small but the beef had no flavor. My tostada had beans and tons of lettuce.. The small of guacamole I had was actually very tasty. I would never order this again I just didn't care for it and the taste. I could have done with out all the lettuce and had more of the other stuff on it.\n\nMy man had Fajitas and he said they weren't as good as Ricardo's or Cabo but he said they were decent. I tried a piece of his flour tortilla and I have to say I should have just ordered a stack of those and some guacamole because the tortillas were good. And the tortillas weren't small either they were a decent size.\n\nThe pic I took and posted on here looks way more appetizing then it really was. I tried to like it but I just honestly didn't :(\n\nThey had a man singing live music which was a nice touch. and happy hour specials  but during happy hour a margarita is still going to run you $4.50.\n\nI don't see when we would be back here since there are other yummy Mexican places around town and especially with Ricardo's just down the street."

It took forever for them to take our order, the waiter forgot about my guacamole & sour cream, they forgot to refill my boyfriend's soda and my friend pronounced the very long Spanish word that supposedly earned him a free margarita...which they never brought.\n\nYes, I'm Mexican so let me say that the food is mediocre. I think you'd had better luck going to Pepe's Tacos down the street. The beans needed salt and. I felt that they were like Rosarito beans that you get from a can and just heat up. I don't understand why all their burritos are smothered in sauce and cheese. that's more of a enchilada...and if I wanted an enchilada I'd order one. A burrito is meant to be eaten with hands, not with a fork."

They had a Yelp checkin that offered us a free margarita so we all checked in and got some. Our Servers were Awesome and they care very much about making our experience with them Wonderful. They sang to me with a band of fellow servers and gave me dessert and tequila slammer to top it off.\n\nNeedless to say we Highly recommend Bonita Michoacan!\n\nMust try the carnitas and Enchiladas with green sauce."

We have been here before, but I have never reviewed this restaurant.\n\nWe started out with the chips and salsa along with bean dip.  I could actually make a meal out of these alone, but I paced myself.  Unlike my last review I was able to get my favorite Raspberry Iced Tea, and it was delicious.\n\nMom had a Chicken Chimichanga, our daughter had a Steak Burrito, and I ordered a Chopped Beef Burrito.  All of them came with the usual rice and beans.  We ordered a side of Guacamole and to our surprise, our server Lorenzo brought out all of the ingredients including the fresh avocados and began to prepare it right there at our table.  He seasoned it just to our liking and wow, delicious.\n\nMom and I spooned the fresh guacamole on our burritos, mmm, a nice added spice to an already delicious burrito.\n\nLorenzo was a great server, very attentive to our needs, and of course, our drinks never went dry.\n\nOverall, Bonito Michoacan is an excellent restaurant and we will certainly be back."

Chips, salsa and bean dip come to the table when you first sit down. \nOne of my favorite dishes here is their fajitas. Shrimp and/ or chicken. The tortillas are home made, you can't beat that! Fideo soup usually comes with an entree. I always add a little salsa for a kick. \nIf you're celebrating a birthday be sure to let them know.

For starters, complimentary fresh fried tortilla chips are served with warm bean dip and red salsa or you can request for the spicier habanero salsa which I love. They also give you a complimentary small bowl of fideo soup to wet your appetite. For appetizers, we ordered the beef sopitos which were very juicy and delicious topped with guacamole and sour cream. If you checkin with your Yelp account, they give you a free margarita! I always end up getting full just from the the complimentary appetizers, so save room for the delicious entrees. \n\nFor dinner we ordered the Carnitas Michoacanas and the Chicken Mole Poblano. The carnitas were cooked in spices and were very succulent and tasty. They are served with a green salsa and a spicy charred jalape\u00f1o, yum! The chicken mole poblano was juicy and served smothered in a flavorful, mildly spicy and sweet brown mole sauce, so good! Both entrees are served with Mexican rice and warm beans topped with cheese. \nAlso all of the entrees come with freshly made corn or flour tortillas that are warm and delicious. We always leave here stuffed, satisfied and with leftovers because the portions are huge!"

This was, by far, the best Latino food that we have ever had. The atmosphere was great and everyone working there greeted us warmly and were very friendly throughout. There was a Mariachi band playing, but not too loud, and everything just felt comfortable. The decor was bright and festive, but it was not over the top. The thing that we noticed first was that almost everyone eating there was Latino, and that, to us, is always a good sign of authentic food. The food did not disappoint. Everything was so good overall that we came back the next day for lunch before heading back home-- just to get another taste of it. The best of what we tried: the oysters (I am not a fan but my husband ate the heck out of them happily), the cheese fundo, and the guacamole. The warm, homemade tortillas were the best tortillas I have ever had as well, and if I could somehow magically have them at my house every day, I would be eating a steady diet of them. All in all, a good value for the money, a nice experience, and wonderful food."

Of course the margaritas aren't bad either!  Love this place!"

My hubby and my daughter went with another couple who also had a 3yo and they had an easily accessible table for the 6 of us. Us ladies ordered frozen guava margaritas which were veeeeery tasty and the consistency was very smooth. I'm usually a rocks kinda girl and I'm truly not a guava fan but I tried hers and needed one too!!! While we were deciding our server brought out sopa de fideo for the kids which was nice because we didn't even ask!\nNow to the food! With the location of this place the prices surprised the hell out of me.....I'm not saying it was \u00fcber expensive but the average was probably $15 which is a little out there for a Mexican restaurant IMO. Every meal comes with chips, salsa, and beans and the sopa. I had birria de chiva which is goat cooked in a red sauce or was pretty delish! Hubby had a shrimp/octopus coctel it was the usual nothin special. The other couple had an enchilada and then shrimp fajitas. All pretty ordinary. I did see they make guacamole table side and got to watch another table have it made it looked pretty cool!  We were too full for dessert... \nService was good\nDrinks were awesome \nThe food...nothin special.\nWill I return, yes! I think I'm gonna try somethin different/unique so they can change my mind a lil :)"

They give you free chips, salsa and bean dip from the get go. If you order an entree they bring the tomato/noodle (fideo) soup out pre-meal as well. The enchiladas are fluffy and cheesey and the enchilada sauce isn't so strong or greasy it gives you heartburn. The 'Mexican Pizza' appetizer is awesome, very crunchy with light fluffy chicken (or beef if you choose) on top. They'll make guacamole right at your table for like $7. It can get a little chunky if you put everything in it, but it's a big amount you can take home. I enjoy everything I order here and have heard rave reviews about the Steak Ranchero as well. Haven't had anything bad yet. I'd like to save room for once to try their fried icecream, it looks like they give a generous portion!"

            "review": "Went here a couple of weeks ago on a weekend at about 3:30-4'ish.  There were a few people in there but it wasn't packed.  I had the Sopes,  (Sopes -Three  handmade tortillas gorditas, lightly deep fried. Topped with chorizo, carne asada or pollo asado.) with carne asada a taco, basically, but with a  thicker, fried corn tortilla, complete with onions, cilantro, etc.  No sissy lettuce and tomato on these tacos.  It also came with beans and rice (some of the better rice I've had, I find it always to be dry and bland, but I like flavor) I finished 2 of them (out of the 3 I had), but couldn't handle eating anymore.  My boyfriend had a dish that was even better than mine.  I can't remember the name of it, but I'm waiting for him to answer me so I know what it is. - Now I know! It was the Steak Picado- (New York steak in small chunks, saut\u00e9ed with onions, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, tomatoes and mixed with Spanish & verde sauce.) I remember, it was nice chunks of meat in a red sauce (not mole, not chile colorado), I took a bite of it, and the meat was incredibly tender, not the dry, in the crockpot for 6 hours, shredded tender, the tender that only comes from a good piece of meat.  It yields slightly, but as soon as you bit in, it's pure, soft, moist bliss.  And no gristle!  Their handmade tortillas are also very, very good.  I watched the nice lady make tortillas the whole time I was there, she was a busy lady!  \nWe finished it off with the fried ice cream.  To me, it left more to be desired.  The coating seemed...almost stale, it was hard to chew and the ice cream was just plain vanilla ice cream.  I heard the table next to us order the fried banana after the waiter's suggestion, they seemed satisfied with it and finished the whole thing.  All in all, I will definitely go here again, just on the Steak Picado alone."

Busy, busy, busy!\n\nThe food is always very delicious which receives a 5 Star, but I rated this review a 4 Star because the servers were not very attentive and seemed like they really didnt care. Upon checking in on yelp, you can receive one free house margarita, which we showed to the waiter. He wanted to take our phones to the bartender...Whoa...ah, no you cannot take our phones to the bar(which was on the other side of the restaurant! Would you let a person who you did not know, take your phone and your sisters to the bar? No! LOL. So, I had to walk all the way to the bar and show the bartender myself. I thought that was weird and not very professional. Anyways, after that incident, it seemed like the waiter became dis-interested. Our water glasses were never refilled, had to continually ask for a refill of the salsa and chips, and when we were presented our check, he just set it down and never said thank you.\nOk, I know they were very busy, but it just seemed like he could careless. We would have left a higher tip, but felt like we really weren't treated very well(we have been dining here for years).\n\nAll in all, the food is great and I will continue to dine here."

He said everything was good as well.\n\nThis location offered a free house margarita for checking in for Yelp users. The drink was actually very good and I ordered another. I did notice they only give each table one complimentary chips/salsa/beans starter and charging $3.50 for additional refills. I have to say I've never encountered this, even at more upscale restaurants.

We tried a different place each night on this last little jaunt to Vegas and because I am so much of a Smartina Navratolova I wanted Mexican food and so I went to my Yelp app on my Smart phone and searched for a highly rated restaurant with reasonable prices and Bonito Michoacan came right up.  We were in the neighborhood (my brother in law is Chinese) so we hung a U and drove right into the parking lot (yeah buddy they even have parking fa YA)! \n\nWe went inside and the place is beautiful.  There is a beautiful woman who hand makes tortillas RIGHT there. I love that. \n\nThe bathrooms are beautifully decorated ...beautiful I LOVE the copper basins.\n\nThe whole place is colorful,extremely inviting and interesting. \n\nSo we walk inside from hot to cool.  We are greeted by a young woman with a beautiful smile and they have a table ready for us (party of 7).  They bring over these hot chips, with warm bean dip AND really delicious salsa.  (This is new, most places offer salsa and chips and that's it right?) \n\nThen a very nice gentleman asks if we would like drinks YEAH! We order 3 top shelf frozen margaritas (two plain, one mango) and my Mother said it was the best margarita she's ever had...they came out quickly, very well blended and huge (meets all my criteria :-)  \n\nSo far ...I AM IN HEAVEN I thought...but then we hear music and there is a male singer who sings a beautiful array of Spanish dinner songs and even one Bossa Nova (EYE EYE YEY) Now I am in heaven.\n\nSo we check the menu, very reasonable prices, I ordered the Steak Ranchero medium rare, my Mom ordered SHRIMP Ranchero and there were 5 other orders ...I was a little too busy with my margarita to tell you what they got but I can tell you they were all happy.  We did not have room for dessert this time but I am definitely going back next time I get to Vegas and I will update this report when I do okay? \n\nThe food was fresh, tasty, hot and it came out of the kitchen quickly.  I had to get a to go box and so did my mother.  \n\nThey offer hot tortillas, with butter if you ask and the service was oN POINT. Friendly, polite, sweet and generous. My mother said she loved that place and believe me ...she is usually a ...well... a mother. \n\nI have not felt as if I got MORE than my money's worth in quite a long time but (well technically since I didn't pay ...oh you get the picture) \n\nVery very good find, thanks yelp, thanks everyone who rated this restaurant because you all helped make a great evening possible for my family.

Well, we could kick ourselves for not stopping in before. \n\nI ordered the Chile Rellenos Camerones, which were 2 mild green peppers stuffed with shrimp and topped with cheese. They were really tasty and the shrimp tasted fresh and not like they've been sitting in the fridge for a week.  This entree came with tortillas (corn or my choice, flour) freshly made on-site.  Curiously though, as many homemade tortillas I have eaten in my life, these got really stiff, pasty and cracker like once they got cold.\n\nThe wife had the Sopes with Carne Asadas which she enjoyed.  Our sons enjoyed a cheese quisadilla and the other, a cheeseburger and fires, which were really good.\n\nAll entrees came with a really good fideo soup.  \n\nService was really good.  The only hiccup came at the end.  At the beginning of the meal (when we were ordering) I presented our 20% off coupon from our local newspaper that was valid Sun-Fri.  Our server told us he would deduct the discount when he brought our bill at the end of the meal and placed the coupon in his shirt pocket.\n\nI made a silent bet with myself that the bill would not reflect the discount because the server was going to worry we would not tip him appropriately.  My wife and I are not those kind of tippers.  If they are good they will always get 20% from us and if there is a discounted amount, they always get the pre-discount amount for a tip, but we know there's a lot of people who don't practice this but to each their own.\n\nAnyways, we finally got the bill adjusted and left, happy.\n\nWe'll definitely be returning here and bring out of town family and friends here also, since El Patron closed.  This place is a lot cheaper than Lindo in HD, whose parking lot also sucks!"

I'd definitely eat here again the next time I'm in Vegas."

This was a perfect way to start our meal,  while we were looking over the menu we were served chips, salsa and beans.   We were starving so that went pretty fast.   We then ordered our entrees,  I ordered the camerones al conac and he ordered camorones dionisio.  We were still hungry after the chips and salsa so we ordered chips and guacamole which they prepare tableside.   (You can definitely tell these servers do the tableside guacamole several times a day) it's nice that they ask if you want all the ingrediants and how spicy you would like your guac.  The guacamole was nice and refreshing with our margaritas.   Then our soup came.   The fideo soup was a small cup of tomatoey brothey noodle goodness,  I finished every last bite.  When our entrees came out, we both finished everything off our plates,  shrimp,  tortillas,  rice,  beans and a dallop of guacamole,  everything was good!   I enjoyed everything from the service to the margaritas to the appetizers to the entrees,  by this time we were pretty full so passed in the desserts,  I definitely recommend this place for the service,  atmosphere and food."

So finally on a slower day I decided to give it a try :P\n\nThe ambience was highly energetic.  All the coworkers  gathered and sang two different birthdays.  The decor was very colorful and gave the Spanish vibe.\n\nAs I looked their menu I was getting pretty  full eating their complimentary snack- chip and dips.  They had bean, salsa and guacamole (this was extra $8)  :P  what was so awesome, was how they made the guacamole right in front of us!  Two whole avocados and get to tell them how spicy you like it.  Then they also give this comp soup cup - chicken/tomato I think ? It was pretty delicious. \n\nTheir cilantro steak ($16) was very tender - I ordered the steak medium rare.  They had \nGreen sauce with saut\u00e9ed onions on top of the steak.  It came as a combo - with rice and beans.  \n\nI also tried their chil\u00e9 relle\u00f1o burrito ($8.95).  I wasn't too impressed with it.  This is what I would order at any other Mexican fast food chains, but this restaurant made it like an enchilada style - with tomato salsa over it.  \nMaybe next time I'll tell them just like a regular burrito with beans and rice inside the burrito and no sauce on top :P"

            "review": "Well....out of all the Michoacan family of restaurants, I would rank this my #3 choice, with Viva being #1 and Lindo being #2.\n\nThere's a couple of reasons for this -\n\n1.) Viva gives you complimentary fideo soup when requested. If it doesn't come with an entree, Bonito charges you $2.50 for it. It's good soup but not worth paying $2.50 when it costs probably $.25/cup to make. \n2.) The customer service is off par from the rest. I experienced a rude, short tempered server today at lunch. When I advised my meal came out wrong, he refuted \"well this is the way you told me you wanted it!\". Well, actually that's not the way I told you and I wouldn't be telling you it was wrong if you just listened the first time. My last visit, when I asked the question \"what is fundido dip?\" I was treated like I was stupid for not knowing. It was off putting.\n3.) The busser was kind but she was bad at refilling drinks. My one pet peeve is drink refills. Don't keep me hanging....\n4.) The chips and bean dip that come out are bland. Do they use different chips & dip than the other Michoacan resturants? I'm not certain but they don't taste as good here. \n\nThere are good things about the resturant as well - \n\n1.) They have an extensive Mexican themed menu with many options for even the pickest of eaters. My favorites are the beef chimichangas and the beef flour flautas. Their spanish rice is decent and their refried beans are good & consistent. I tried my friends carne asada steak today and it was juicy and yummy. Their homemade flour tortillas are delish!\n2.) They run resonably priced lunch specials. For two of us, we escaped at around $20.00...not bad for a sit down lunch. \n3.) It seemed as though before our tushs hit the seats that there were chips and dip on the table. We were immediately asked what we would like to drink. Very speedy in this regard.\n4.) Pleasant hostess staff, large restaurant seating areas and a full service bar."

Then the chips with salsa and very good re fried beans in a small bowl. Settled on chicken enchiladas with white sauce . Must not have liked it because I don't remember it being very good. Service was great. Ordered guacamole and they fixed it at the table for you. Very good. Was not crowded since it was Sunday before noon. Did not like being in a cramp place. There were five of us. Also used the womens bathroom they ran out of paper towels. Told waitress and a very nice lady and gentleman talking to her offered me their napkins.

Fantastico!\n\nIf you want to enjoy REAL Mexican food at a fraction of the price of restaurants on the strip, then this is the place! Great food, great service, great prices and more money for Blackjack!"

We found this place on Yelp and with all the great reviews everyone left we had to try it. The restaurant was as good or even better then everyone said it would be. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and seated right away. Our server came right out with chips salsa and beans to dip. After looking at the menu for a few minutes our server took our order and the food came right out. Everything everyone ordered looked and tasted great! We told our server it was one of our friends BDay and the whole restaurant came out and sang 2 songs to her! One in English and one in Spanish lol its was soo cool! They even gave her chooros topped with whipped cream lol we had a great time here and id recommend everyone who is looking for good food and great service to come here. You wont regret it!"

They come quickly, taste fantastic, and are plentiful.\n\nService is also great - I found it hard to reach the bottom of my glass before refills, waiters were (sincerely) friendly, etc.\n\nSoon after ordering they brought an appetizer of spaghetti soup(?) which was way too salty for my taste.\n\nI had ordered the fajita, which was just okay. The beans/rice/guac that came with were high quality but pretty sparse. It came with some pretty amazing flour tortillas though, which really carried the meal.\n\nFlan topped off my lunch here for dessert. It was definitely too sweet and soft for my taste, but was edible."

This dish is full of flavor, very tasty. There were various shrimp prepared differently. The crab legs were also tasty. The rice served in the platter was my favorite with a flavorful sauce that included fish and squid -- yummy!! Violeta, our server, was very gracious and friendly.

That was initially impressive! Our waiter was a man named Lorenzo. We ordered drinks, got our chips and salsa/bean dip rather quickly. We ordered our food and from then on it was a 45+  minute wait to receive the food. I think I would have been okay with waiting on the food if I didn't notice that all other families that arrived after mine were brought their food right away. Small or larger groups everyone else's waiters were ON IT; however, ours was not. I finally could not stand it any longer and approached him to ask if he could bring our food as each plate was ready, versus waiting on all of them to be ready entirely. He seemed annoyed at my comment, but noticing how slow he was moving kept irritating me.\n\nOnce the food arrived, I was starved and shoved everything down. I had a combination plate with Huevos Rancheros. The hand made tortillas that came with the meal were a nice surprise. However, the rice was bland. My huevos rancheros had a weak red sauce with no flavor. I asked around the table, and the variety on our table had burritos and fish combo plates, yet they all agreed that each item was rather bland. \n\nThe alcoholic drink selection although not that large, was very good. I ordered something called \"Que Viva la Borrachera\" and I have to say that probably saved this entire rating. They packed on the alcohol!\n\nI would consider this place for appetizers and drinks with a friend, but not for a meal."

Good we ordered was the tacos lengua(cow tongue) and my fish tacos! Everything tastes okay UNTIL I went to go eat my last tacos and noticed a baby ant hop off my plate O_o yeah and we all know ants just don't roll solo now do they? Know what this means right? There's clearly more and to what wasn't a surprise I glance over at the window seal and it's plenty more under this vase! YUCK! We immediately got our server who apologized and told us this wasn't likely well we decided to kill one of them and save it in a napkin for management and surely she came out thinking that it couldn't be possible.. She explained that they always clean very good.. Well apparently not because these ants been shacking up for a while. She apologized and gave us HALF off our bill which actually should've been completely comp'd and maybe even a gift certificate to try them again. After being grossed out I didn't even want a to-go box..not sure if i would've wanted anymore ants to bring home (a lot of pun intended).."
