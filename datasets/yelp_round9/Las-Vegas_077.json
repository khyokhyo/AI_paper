I ordered chicken wings and they were pink on the inside so I told my server she said she was going to go to the cook so they can recook them so she did and brought them back out meanwhile my lunch break was over so I had to take them to go a few hours later I try to eat them again and they were still pink. I then went back to talk to the manager and he was the rudest person I've ever met in my life!!! He tried to tell me that All chicken is pink on the inside, when have you ever ate a piece of chicken that is pink on the inside???!!!! That means it is not cooked fully. I am pregnant and I can't be eating raw chicken and get salmonella. Worst customer service ever I will never be going back there and my life!!! Don't give them any of your money!"

The burgers are once more great, good steak sandwich, best root beer and onion rings, they now have dessert which before they didn't have anything at all to speak of, and of course their beer is excellent. They did take some items off the menu, hope they still serve the Alfredo Pizza which we highly recommend.... We live close by so we were happy that we have this local's place available again."

            "review": "I go to this restaurant all the time, so I'm not sure why it took so long to write this review.  Anyway, there is no better deep dish pizza in Las Vegas.  My wife and I always get the Hawaiian and it never disappoints.  Note:  this pizza isn't for health nuts, so if you're on a diet I would avoid it.  The 9\" is the perfect size for two and, though it looks small, it will fill you up.  Chicago Brewing also has excellent beer, with 4-5 standards that they serve all year and some wonderful seasonals.  Last night, I tried the Fauxlanders Red (a sour) and it was outstanding.  For a casual night out with the family or a friend, this is the perfect spot.  Staff is friendly but not suffocating and they have a nice small patio out back.  You can fill up your growlers here too."

I was amazed by how nice they were to us and got us right in even though it was a busy day!\n\nIt had been some time since I had been here, not to much seemed to have changed.

One of teammates gets us the hook up if weather permits we get a reserve section out in the beer garden area (they only run that during the summer months) just did it inside since too cold. We were upstairs bar area. Part of the restaurant that most people don't know about but lot more spacious then the downstairs bar area. It carpeted upstairs, the lounge chairs lot more comfortable (downstairs more stand up bar stool/chair), and even have little arcade type area have golden tee and couple other games.  Watching any games have more then enough televisions upstairs or downstairs. They do also sell cigars if in the mood for stogie and cognac. The restaurant area not all that big but have ample amount of booths and tables too choose from. It interesting setup since you literally have three different area can hang out at! \n\nThey do have great prices for HH. It been while since came here for HH. The beer here is delicious! Every time I keep coming love mixing up my brews from darker stouts too lighter ales. I know not many brewery in Vegas but feel Chicago Brewing Company Brew the best craft beers in Vegas. They mix it up from time too time and they do seasonal beers all the time.\n\nThe food I order the Italian Beef Sandwich. I believe it first time ordered this sandwich and why not ordered it sooner. Not that I had problem with any of there sliders (they have few too choose from) I love! Especially if put some Ghost sauce on the sliders or just about anything goes well. The KEY is NOT ON THE MENU.......So if want too get kicked by some SERIOUS heat just have ask the server for some Ghost sauce. We got some last night. Italian Beef Sandwich had so much flavor no need too kick it up. The pickled jalapenos, roasted bell peppers, onions, and something else all combine put on top of the sandwich. You have cup of au jus dip it in. So good!! The fries nothing special skinny cut fries. Even if nothing special refreshing basic fries come out hot and well seasoned. Sure this sandwich would order again and again."

It has chopped tomatoes, egg, smoked bacon, and crumbled blue cheese tossed over mixed greens.  It was a decent size and very fresh.  My husband got the ribs and chicken.  I was able to try a few of the ribs and they were very good.  \n\nOur service was good, the food was decent, since they brew their own beers, it will be something we come back for to try another day."

I had to wait about five minutes if not more, to order a beer. \nThe bartenders, what children that work there, with busy playing Games with each other or chatting with you all the customers and not paying attention to that job.\nWith so many choices in this town, this is not one that will be on my list of places to return to. I think management has dropped the ball by not paying attention to their business."

I look forward to trying the rest of the menu!\n\nHowever, these are my complaints: my friend ordered a grasshopper for me. Don't get me wrong- it was very delicious. However, when it came to the bill, it appeared charged as a Colorado Bulldog (those are two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT drinks). Also, my friend asked me to suggest him s drink to order at the bar (I'm a bartender) and I suggested a Sombrero (milk and Kahlua, nothing special) the bartenders apparently were clueless on what it was, apparently googled it and still had no idea what it was or even nearly claimed it does not exist. But yet they have a button on the register for a Colorado Bulldog?! (basically a sombrero with a splash of cola)\n\nWell, I really want to like this place. I'm giving it another try, just because the food was great."

I've been there 3 times, and it's always been horrendously slow, despite the place not being very busy (5 tables seated max).\n\nToday was the last straw.  My friend ordered the artichoke spinach dip, and the waiter botched it.  The waiter put the order in as chili.  By the time the corrected dish came out of the kitchen, my friend had to leave, and couldn't even eat her food.\n\nWhen I got the check, I found the waiter had rung up my friend's Diet Coke as a 14 oz beer, charging me $5 for a soft drink.\n\nI will never go back there, and I told the staff why."

Whoever likes spicy food you must try the Ghost Wings. Chicken wings with ghost Chilli pepper sauce, hottest pepper in the world. They should have a challenge here for eating those wings. Another signature item must try is their garlic knots.  Overall a fun place to hang out and enjoy their hand craft beers."

Waiter saw that and gave me a dirty look. Had 20 minutes until his sexton closed, he gave some girls some stuff and helped them, came to us 5 minutes before shift (yes, 15 minutes passed) and then said here's so menus, I'm leaving. \n\nThen, we pick what we want and go to bar, he says, \"wrong menu\". Gave us another one, finally ordered and they delivered. Overall it was okay- not so bad, but not so good. I figured for having table seating it might be a little better than standard bar food, but not that impressed. \n\nI get the waiter, but just get over it, obviously I wasn't purposely being a jerk, I just didn't see you. \n\nI also got eye-rolled for smoking and as well as they held their noses, by two \"dimbo\" girls.  It's a bar, 2AM, get over yourselves. Speaking of them, the crowd was young, too much for me. Can't believe I'm saying that and I'm not even 29, that's both: depressing and pitiful."

Definitely try out their beer tasting sampler if you're curious about the selection of beers they have.\n\nThe atmosphere is really nice and fun to hang out in. I dig the brick walls and views of the brewery. The servers are friendly and make sure that you're doing well regularly.\n\nAlthough the food is a bit overpriced, the portions are huge and everything I've tried has been good. The chili fries are perfect to share among friends, although I wasn't stoked with the beer cheese sauce they make. The burgers and sandwiches have not disappointed, and I really enjoyed the homemade ranch chips.\n\nFor a couple beers this is place is perfect, the food is consistently good but not amazing. However, the quick service and chill vibe will bring me back."

I seriously doubted it. Cus the guy next to him said under his breath keep that fruity shit downstairs. How are you of of beer at a brewery what a joke. \n\nBeing that it has a Chicago name most would assume it's a Chicago sports friendly bar. Well the other night during the Chicago Hockey game there were plenty of Chicago fans I jokingly said to the bartender hey were in a Chicago bar why aren't you a Chicago fan?! \n\nWow the attitude I got from the bartender and the customer at the bar was amazing. He responded this isn't a Chicago bar!!  I will never return there again used to be my go to spot to watch football games. \n\nJust a price of advice have Chicago friendly bartenders at least support the name. Jeez.

We were excited to meet other fans, but disappointed to learn this is not really a \"Chicago\" establishment as the name implies. Different tables of us were given conflicting information about happy hour and about their policy on watching the game. We were told in the downstairs bar that they only provide sound for the game in the upstairs bar, so we had to move upstairs. That was fine, but once there we were informed that a private party had reserved the space, so we could not listen to the whole game. Another employee then told us that the party would be in a separate room and we actually could keep the sound. We specified that we needed to know for sure so we could decide whether to stay or go watch the game elsewhere and were reassured we should stay. So, we ordered more food and drinks and invited other friends to join us, bringing the group up to 6 people. It was extremely frustrating when employees then turned off the sound and we then had to watch several innings while listening to crap music instead. The bartender did take mercy and we were able to hear the final inning. The bartender was actually amazing, running drinks and food out to us from behind the bar even though he was the only one up there. The beer was good, pork sliders good, and pretzel bites were good. The caprese salad was disappointing, and the garlic bites were cold by the time they got to us. Overall, it was a disappointing and frustrating game watching experience, for which I blame poor management. The employees did their best given a poorly planned event."

The sliders weren't spectacular, but certainly above average. The pretzel bites themselves weren't anything special, BUT, the dipping sauces (cheese and mustard) wwre AMAZING.\nWe had a thin crust pizza, and it was great.  Crust still had a little chewyness to it, and didn't seem like it was made on crackers like many thin crusts.\n\nThe root beer was really good (I think they make that in house too).

My boyfriend really enjoys their summer ale at the moment.\n\nThey have a fairly extensive menu, which ranges from gourmet pizzas to pot roast to standard bar fare. The food is definitely good, but some items are a little on the expensive side. For example, a large chicken caesar salad will set you back $12 (it's decently portioned, but it's still chopped lettuce with some chicken). Conversely, the chicken parmigiana, which is absolutely delicious, is $12.99; but any average eater could easily get two meals out of it.\n\nThe staff is nice and fairly attentive, but sometimes the service is a little slow, depending on if you sit in the bar or not and the time of day.\n\nI'd definitely recommend, but know you're probably going to throw down about $20 to get the full Chicago experience."

They have deep dish pizza, but just like Windy City, it's not REALLY deep dish. It's not deep enough! I don't understand why they can't make the crust thicker by using a deeper pan.

Their menu is limited to pizza, sandwhichs, typical bar food. We didn't order the pizza or beer because we just had it for lunch. I had the chili, my bf ordered the pastrami sandwhich which was just ok but I didnt like the bread it came on. He also had a side of mac and cheese that looked like it was kraft from the box. I could of made that for 25cents. The only cool thing I thought they had was chicken wings or tenders with ghostpeppers. It is supposedly the hottest pepper on the planet? Its pretty expensive too, $14 for 4 tenders or 6 wings. Since no one in our group wanted to eat it for a challenge we ordered the tenders and each took one. I think we all had about 1 bite and immediately needed a jug of water and glasses of milk. It was SPICY!!\n\nIf you ever have friends to want to take a challenge, Chicago's ghostpepper chicken wings are the place to go for it."

            "review": "Its been a few years since i last frequented Chicago Brewing.  I was really pleased with my recent visit!  Chicago was opened in 1999, and back then the craft beer and the menu would have been a real exotic in Vegas.  They have several slider hamburgers with odd meats like alligator, bison, kangaroo, and antelope.  These days, it might be just a novelty, but I loved it!  \n\nI had alligator sliders with the house stout.  My coworkers tried the house IPA, the cheese steak, and one of the salads (the one with tuna on it).  My alligator sliders were awesome.  They each had an egg sunny side up, a tomato, lettuce and sauce.  The dish came with a side of sweet potato fries.  I've never had alligator before!  It tasted kind of like a cross between fish and beef.  The patty itself was lightly fried with some spices that really made the flavor quite nice.  \n\nMy friends both enjoyed their lunches as well.  The salad wasn't the best, but it wasn't an iceberg bomb either.  The beer was pretty good.  Back in 1999, this beer would have been top notch.  Today, the West Coast style of brewing is to make bigger beers.  None of the beers crafted at Chicago are above 6.5%.  Chicago has kind of fallen behind the times a little, but the beer is still awesomely fresh.  You can see the brewery through glass walls in the center of the establishment!\n\nOverall, while not the best brewery in Vegas (ahem, Draft House), it is a real treat for craft beer drinkers.  The food is good too.   The restaurant is small enough to be cozy and intimate, so even non-beer drinkers should have a visit to check out the strange sliders or maybe a pizza!"

            "review": "Sunday nights, I don't get out of work until 10 PM. Like many towns, there's not a lot open around 11ish unless you want to pay exorbitant prices on the Strip, or eat fast food. \n\nWell on Sunday, 4/17/11, Lawrence T., came to see the show I work for and afterward, we were in search of some food. Having missed out on Ken M.'s UYE \"Pizzas, Peppers & Pints\" and living too far away to come here by myself, I was dying to try this place because they serve Ghost Peppers and luckily, it's right around the corner from Lawrence's apartment, so that's where we ended up going.\n\nIt was a ghost town when we walked in. There was one person in one booth when we walked on in. We were seated right next to the kitchen. I was torn when I saw the menu. \"Chicken fingers in ghost pepper sauce or ribs.\" It was a tough choice because I'd been dying for ribs for a good week now, and to add insult, my parents had went to Lucille's BBQ earlier that day with my youngest siblings and brought my sister and me back nada. The pull for BBQ was too strong, and I ordered the ribs and fries ($19), and Lawrence ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich ($10)  topped with breaded onion strings, and macaroni salad.\n\nWe didn't have to wait too long for our meal to be delivered to us. The food runner switched our plates and seemed a bit surprised that no, the meat was my order. My ribs were good, but not fall off the bone. They weren't the Memphis Dry Rub ribs that I love so much, they were smothered in some sort of BBQ sauce. I regret not trying the Ghost Pepper... anything because common sense tells me I can eat BBQ anywhere. Lawrence took half his sandwich home for the next day but I assume he liked it.\n\nOur bill came out to $31.35 with tax, which is a little steep for late night food, but that's my fault for ordering ribs. Would I be back, eh... only if I'm for sure going to order something with the Ghost Pepper, otherwise, nah."

There was a pungent overpowering smoke odor and I just felt like I wanted to shower as soon as I got home to get the smell out of my hair.  We sat at a table and one of us had to get up each time and order pitchers at a time since it took awhile to get drinks.\n\nThe second time, I sat with a few friends at the tables on the first floor by the fireplace.  The service was extremely slow and I realized after awhile it was because the main bartender was also running around grabbing table orders too.  I'm not sure if that's usually how it is, but that definitely caused a delay in service.  Again, we'd preemptively order a couple drinks at once to hold us over until he came back around.\n\nDon't ask why, but I ordered the ahi tuna salad. At a bar. Hmm.  It was actually pretty okay though.  Too much salad to tuna ratio, but it was okay.  I wouldn't order it again though.  The general agreement from my other friends about the food was that it was okay.\n\nIf I was rating just beer, I would give this place 4 stars.  They have a house blueberry vanilla kinda beer that is really yummy.  Their house beers are good and I'd go back for that alone.  I really like their house blonde, it's light and tasteful.  But the service is just terrible and the food is just okay. And they don't have that famous big glass drink thing they used to that I've heard people talk about (sorry for the ambiguity since I've never actually seen it)."

The two beers I was struggling between were the Seasonal Daisy Triple and the Fruit Seasonal Mango Hef. Jeff, our server, was helpful in helping me choose between the two. I was looking for a lighter beer and he steered me toward the first option and offered me a sample to make sure I enjoyed it before I committed. The beer was a nice balance to the snack that we ended up getting.\n\nWith four choices of food on the happy hour menu, we decided to get something to tide us over and wait until later to get real food. We decided on the chicken tenders ($6) tossed in the Brew-BQ sauce with a side of ghost sauce. I had experience the insane heat of ghost sauce before and was willing to press my luck again. My lips were on fire and I was in sweet agony. I am truly a sadist when it comes to hot and sour foods. If pain is not something you strive for while eating, don't get this sauce. Jeff was kind enough to keep watch on our waters. I drink a lot while eating and it was only intensified ten folds. The tenders came in an order of five large, juicy strips, dosed in the BBQ sauce."

The veggies on the Lakeshore Veggie are cooked perfectly (we get it without mushrooms because I can't stomach the fungi). The crust is crunchy a buttery, the sauce tangy but not overpowering. The chips and salsa (plus beer cheese dip) were also good. I loved the chips and the salsa. The cheese beer dip was sweet. I don't know what that was about, I don't know what beer they used, but it just didn't taste right. I could have eaten more chips, but thank goodness the pizza came out just in time.\nI also had a full mug of the Ramblin' Reck Red. It was quite delicious. I bit more carbonation than other reds I've had, but still a nice malty flavor. \nI would have considered a 5 star, but our service just wasn't good. It was dinner time and happy hour so CBC was hopping. Our server was working tables inside and outside. We kind of got the shaft. He was very apologetic, which was nice, but not fun. \nI am looking forward to my next time so I can have some more beer."

Chicago is one of the bigger breweries in the Las Vegas scene and pretty much anyone into craft beer has been or heard of this place. My review really just applies to happy hour so keep that in mind.\n\nCBC features several standard beers along with a few rotating seasonal. The hefe, IPA, brown, stout and some others comprise the regular beers, keep an eye out for the Hawaiian Honey with an astounding 14% ABV. My personal favorite, the Hefe is true to it's German roots with a crisp wheat taste and golden color. Service is hit or miss during happy hour and may have to wave down a bartender to get your order in. \n\nHappy hour is M-F 3pm-7pm in either the upstairs or downstairs bars. I was a little disappointed that there is no late night happy hour which probably explains why this place is a ghost town after 8pm. They offer up $6 pitchers along with $2 14oz and $2.50 22oz. Great prices on awesome beer you can't get anywhere else in town. CBC is pretty weak on the food offerings, $6 for chicken fingers, a cheese pizza and garlic knots. Meh. The upstairs bar doubles as a cigar lounge so if second hand smoke isn't your thing, stay away."

Its HH is POPPING during game time with excited screaming fans (me included)!\n\nYES, its attractive offers are still ALL there, i.e.:\n- 22oz draft for $2.50; wine, 3; well drinks, 4; delicious HH bar dishes ($3-6) ); \n- Its reverse HH still goes between 10-midnight (I've got to give it a try after movies sometime)!\n\nYELPY DETAILS YOU CAN IGNORE:\n- After a long walk in Pueblo Park yesterday (Sunday) afternoon, I wisely decided to hydrate myself properly, well, deliciously! So, I went to CBC for the 22oz draft and thin crust pepperoni pizza($6 plus $1 extra for pepperoni)...over exciting NFL games! \n - And...What a healthy HYDRATING experience it was, indeed! \n\nNow, here's something STRANGE about \"Seating at the BAR COUNTER\", though: \n\n- When I got in CBC around 4:30, I first went upstairs to take a look at their small loft bar. The bar counter itself was completely full; the lounge area still had a few bar tables. However, other than the lone barkeep, I did not see any server upstairs (perhaps, not until after 5pm). \n\n- As I was alone this time, I wanted to sit at the bar counter, so I went back to the downstairs lounge.   Here I was surprised to find out that the Happy Hour seating is \"restricted\" to the lounge area! In other words, one cannot have HH at the downstairs bar counter itself! \n- I think the reason for CBC's doing this is that they want the gaming machines available to playing customers. Perhaps, CBC knows that most their HH customers are NOT INTERESTED in playing video poker machines?\n- There's no such restriction in the loft bar lounge, however. \n\n- Well, luckily, I got a comfy bar table along the wall, with a great viewing angle for several tv's! The food and drinks were great! My server was pleasant and attentive. And the atmosphere was just right for the occasion! The lounge area was almost completely full by 6pm, full of screaming fans for the 49ers and later for the \"home team\" Bears [who lost, if you care to know, to the Texans!]\n\nBTW: - Oh yes, there's an elevator, too, hidden around the corner of the bar. So, CBC is handicapped friendly.\n\nPeterskis, Nov 2012\n--"

Yes, I know I am ordering one beer and one appetizer but that's why it's happy hour--some people choose to get happier than others, and you still have to wait on me. $5.40 is ultra-cheap for a beer and an appie, but we were there for a couple hours and my friend (who was of the getting-happier variety) had to wave down the bartender who would pass us on his way to and from the other happier tables. Also, the loft is a cigar bar, which I didn't know going into it. I'm not that bothered by that type of smoke but some people might be.\n\nI did have a blueberry beer which I did like a lot, but it would have led to a severe case of gutrot were I to have had more than one. My friend kept downing their IPA and believe me, her happy hour mission was accomplished."

He loves beer and I love daytime drinking so our only requirements were somewhere that you could have/do both. We got the BEST seating outside, directly under the speakers that were playing the BEST 80's songs.  We had so much fun guessing artists and song titles while drinking in the shade. The beer flight there is a STEAL! You pretty much get to try every beer (I don't recall the exact number) and for a great price (I don't recall the price either, sorry!). They also have chilled Fireball just WAITING for you to shoot. \n\nThe best part for me was complimenting our server on what a great job she was doing, only to find out that she's actually a busser! She said our original server got too overwhelmed with his other tables so she had to take over our table.  I was just in awe that someone with such little serving knowledge gave me one of the best dining experiences that I can recall.  I wish I could remember her name but CBC I hope you promoted her to be a server!!\n\nI highly recommend the hot wings as well.  If you're gonna go big and get beer and Fireball -ya gotta get hot wings.  We tried their 'death sauce' or whatever they call it - basically the hottest of the hot. But being hot sauce connoisseurs it wasn't anything we couldn't handle. \n\nThis was my first and only experience at CBC but I can't wait to go back!"

Cool lighting, nice feel, great Happy Hour!\n\nTwo Bars:  Both bars are separated from the restaurant to allow for smoking, but the upstairs bar is cool, classy, and comfortable.\n\nThe Food:  Chicago has a huge list of food, with a lot of interesting options...but all-in-all the food is just average bar quality...maybe slightly better...but nothing to write home about."

Busy, but not like we expected from the lot.\n\nSat in the downstairs bar area, and got a table no problem.  Great service.  Our waiter kept checking on us, even though we took our sweet time looking over the menu.  Settled on an all Happy Hour fair.\n\nThe beer ($6 pitcher):  We got the All-Nighter first.  It was good.  A nice, light blonde.  As expected.  Round 2 was the seasonal All-Nighter (Sommerbrau, maybe?).  This one was better.  Definitely worthy of my ordering it the next visit.\n\nThe food (prices guesstimate, from what I THINK I remember):  They had Chicken Fingers ($5- mild, hot, bbq, teryaki), Chili Cheese Fries ($4), Spinach Artichoke Dip ($6), 10-inch thin cheese pizza ($5), and there was one other item, but I can't think of what it was.  We had the Mild Chicken Fingers (pretty tasty, and plentiful), Spinach Artichoke Dip with tortilla chips (good, have had better, but have had worse), and the cheese pizza (filled the void, but probably wouldn't order again).\n\nOverall:  $30 total (incl. tip) for 2 people, 2 pitchers, 3 apps, all HH items.  Will be back for more.  Next time, I'm thinking we'll try the 10LB burger though.  Sounds yummy!  And as we left, we peaked our heads upstairs and will probably look to sit up there the next time, as the couches were full but the tables were empty.  I would just question the amount of service attention we'd get up there."

They also have a few $6 app choices like pizza and pretzel bites. Apparently they no longer have a late night happy hour which sucks for those who work til 12 on the strip.  \n\nService\nOur bartender was Brad, who really makes you feel like you're a regular on your first visit. He was hilarious and you can tell he has quite the customer base that come back to visit. \n\nAtmosphere\nWhat I like about this location is the three distinct experiences you can have. There is a gaming-bar area which would be somewhat similar to PTs, there is a restaurant as well which caters to more families I'm sure, but then there is the upstairs bar area which includes a cigar area. It's nice to have a bar you can sit at and not feel pressured to gamble at. \n\nTaste\nThe beers we had were super yummy. We did a pitcher of Hef and a light beer selection. The pizza was just alright but the other foods that people were ordering looked bomb. \n\nI will definitely go again! Just wish it was closer to my house."

The quality of the beer at Chicago Brewing Company\n\nLas Vegas lacks a brew pub with great beer, great food, and fun atmosphere. (Big Dogs comes close, but not quite.)  Chicago Brewing Company offers okay food coupled with mediocre beer.  The cavernous (and usually empty) dining room gives off a forlorn vibe.  Combine this with the quality of the beer and you have the epitome of depression right on Sahara Avenue.\n\nWhat can Chicago Brewing Company do to save itself?\n\n1. Start brewing truly original (and tasty) beer.  They are a prime example of how microbrew doesn't always mean good.  For example:  A porter should have a hint of roasted coffee aroma, not taste like someone's excrement after a trip to Starbuck's.\n2. Expand upon the more creative options on the food menu.\n3. Rearrange the dining area to make it more intimate and less \"cavern of doom.\"\n\nUntil then, I will wait for someone to open a great brew pub in Vegas.  However, I won't hold my breath."

I had a bad experience here last month when they completely overlooked a 40-person birthday reservation with no staff to assist and a server that would only stay upon the promise of \"being taken care of,\" but tonight topped the charts for the WORST service I have ever received anywhere. \n\nI decided to go back to try again, as I had been sent a $100 gift certificate by management for the last experience I had. \n\nThe host, Destiny, became very visibly upset as she literally pushed me aside, through my group to walk us to our table. We had only walked a few feet from the hosts booth and were all so confused why she suddenly seemed so angry, as she had basically ignored us upon walking in. As we approached the table that she was throwing our menus down at, I proceeded to ask her if there was something that we did to upset her. She responded with, \"I don't appreciate when people walk ahead of me that I am seating. I'm the host!\"  \n\nDestiny, you work in the service industry as the front of house staff. You set the tone for your guest's experience and you are the LASTING IMPRESSION of the business. If you get that upset over something so minuscule, work in a cubicle and don't plague mankind with your terrible attitude. \n\nNever again, I'm in disbelief that a business could be run so poorly.

It's pretty, all brick, high ceilings, nice circular booths and also tables.  \n\nThe service was excellent.  I ordered a glass of wine and was happy to learn that it was not overpriced.  My husband had the brown ale, and he reports that it's very good.\n\nOur server had to return numerous times, because it takes me forever to figure out what I want to eat, but he never displayed any impatience.  I finally decided on a burger with avocado, and my husband orderd the Chicken Piccata special ($10 - such a deal!), and the Split Pea Soup special.\n\nHe liked his chicken a lot.  It was a good-sized portion of chicken, and came with green beans and fresh red-skinned mashed.  The soup was good, too - a large-sized bowl with thick pea soup.  I tasted it and, as usual, it was way too salty for my taste, but he doesn't care about that.\n\nMy burger arrived on a huge bun, with the avocado, lettuce and tomato.  The tomato was a slice of completely white tomato CORE.  I asked the waitress who delivered it to bring me a slice of real tomato, and she promptly delivered a whole plate of red, sliced tomato.\n\nThe burger was big, and is supposed to be Angus, but it was dry, somewhat overcooked, and definitely not flavorful.  Instead of fries, I ordered a side salad.  The waiter had said I could substitute the salad for the fries, but he didn't say there'd be a $3 extra charge.  I didn't make a fuss when we got the bill because a) we had a $25 restaurant.com certificate, and b) the salad was absolutely huge, a composed salad of greens, iceberg, carrots, chickpeas, tomato, cucumber, olives, and croutons.  I gave half of it to my husband and still had enough to fill me up before the burger arrived.\n\nI like this place:  great atmosphere, great service, and if the food were a tad better, I'd ramp up my rating.

I had the Black Star Stout, the Hardway IPA and the All Nighter and all of them were stellar.  For dinner I had the Cajun pasta, which I would highly recommend to anyone.  The guy sitting next to me at the bar, who appeared to be a regular, told me the deep-dish pizzas here were stellar, but since I was a party of one I thought that a whole deep dish would be too much my waistline.  The rest of the menu appeared to be standard brewery fare with a solid selection of pastas, pizza, sandwiches, burgers and appetizers.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place was kinda nice.  Downstairs had a enclosed smoking area bar (where I learned the bartenders can take your food order but not deliver it to your table due to smoking laws; they leave you food right outside the section, tell you it's ready and you have to get it yourself) complete with many TVs, and there was an upstairs section as well that had a Golden Tee machine and a cigar lounge.  There also was a normal dining area and a patio as well.\n\nService in the smoking area of the bar was a bit slow, as the bartenders seemed a bit preoccupied by the girls at the end of the bar rather than my empty beer glass, but I can't really blame them too much since the girls were hot.\n\nGreat food, great beer, great atmosphere.  Hit his place up if you are ever in the area."

CBC sits in the corner of the parking lot on the Ft Apache side off of Sahara. Very cool looking brick exterior which really reminds of you of a older restaurant from back east, possibly Chicago. \nWhen you walk in they have a few areas for you to choose from on where to sit and eat, and of course drink. Off to the immediate left when you first walk in is the enclosed bar and gaming area. They do serve food in here as well, and with all the TV's neatly tucked up under the bar we usually choose this area. Off to the right hand of side when you walk in is the main dining room which is pretty good size with all different sizes of tables to accommodate a couple or a large group. There is also a second story that is accessible through the bar area, but if I remember right its strictly drinking up, no food. \nLast time we were there was about 3 days ago. We went into the bar area like I said we normally do, and as usual it did not disappoint. We mad small talk with the bartender who is very friendly and even more knowledgeable about his beers. I always go for the Chicago style stuffed crust pizza. They offer many toppings of meat and vegetables. I kept it pretty plain on this night and ordered just pepperoni. I ordered the large which is a little pricey at over 25$, but the pizza is huge and very filling. I also ordered their soup of the day which was the Cajun chicken. My girlfriend ordered the steak sandwich which turned out to be the star of the night....more on that later. We then ordered a few of their hand crafted beers, I ordered the blond, and my gf the stout. Both were very good and not over powering, but not watered down either. \nNow onto the food. My soup came out first. It was a huge bowl of soup, with plenty of great tasting veggies and chicken. The broth was very satisfying and eventually I ate the entire bowl. Next came out my pizza, and my gf's steak sandwich. The pizza was great as usual, very thick, very meaty and the sauce is something that will keep you coming back for sure. True Chicago style pizza. Now the steak sandwich stole the show with a nice 7-8 oz what looked to be NY strip steak, a garlic aoli, lightly breaded onion rings and a very nice bib lettuce. All together this sandwich is top die for. At one point I found myself trying to steal more of the sandwich and left my pizza to the side. \nOverall we cannot get enough of CBC. We always take the extra time to figure out how we can get over there at least once a month, maybe more. True Chicago style pizza, but with a lot more. Check it out, I don't think you will be disappointed."

First time here & the place is broken into a smoking & non smoking area seperated by a door. This is awesome for non smokers as they get to enjoy the bar & restuarant w/o the issue of smoke. The downfall is if you sit in the non smoking area there's no bar. I tend to want to sit at a bar because normally it's faster service & you can chat w/ the bartenders too.\nWe decided to go to the bar which is located in the smoking area, both. We chose the upstairs bar which is small about 8 seats total. There is a small table w/ lounge type chairs, about 6 in that same area. It was great because we got to interact w/ the bartender who was very tentative to us & all the other patrons as well. He even suggested a twist on an old classic. There is a small balcony which we got to step out to to grab some air.\nWe must have come at the right time because there was very little to no smoke around us. Either that or people were just being very respectful to the non smokers, which is hard to find at a place these days. The drinks were on point & we were never fully empty before the next round came. That's a sign of a good bartender. Solid place! Next time we will try the food!"

When we walked in we were advised by the hostess that the upstairs would be a fun place to sit, so we went up there. \n\nUpstairs There are three small  seating areas, but only small group was there. The  first thoughts I had were that the rug looked like it had seen better days and that table bussing was apparently not a priority. The little bar was crowded with happy people and the bartender was great- wonderful smile, nice personality. \n\nI didn't find the leather club chairs to be especially comfortable and would have preferred a real table, but overall, it wasn't a bad experience. There were two nice flatscreen TVs showing basketball, which the bar group enjoyed loudly. I loved how the natural light looked, streaming in through the windows and hitting the brick walls. Ah, Ohio...\n\nThe food? Meh.  When you serve cheese sauce with beer in it, the beer does not make up for using VELVEETA. Ok? REAL cheese, please. The chips weren't that good either. I was so disappointed. I tried the garlic pretzels and they were good, but more like soft, kosher-salted rolls. My friend's steamed clams did not taste fresh to her, but she thought they were ok.  \n\nI don't know that I would come back here. I don't have anything awful to say about it, but I was underwhelmed during this visit."

After all, the website has no disclaimer related to this. Regardless of where I receive the food and service, Happy Hour should apply.\n\nUpdate: Michelle responded to my concerns, so moving up the rating as at least they listen to the customer. thank you!"

They USED TO have some really great food but over the past year the food and service have declined horribly to the point where I will never again spend another dime in this place. The last few times I have tried to order food from there they have messed up my order. I ordered a pizza with artichokes and instead they put anchovies on it and no artichokes! It was SO NASTY!!! Also, it looked like they forgot to put the sauce on the pizza and then put it on last minute as the sauce was on the TOP of the cheese! Never seen a pizza like that in my life, or a nastier excuse for a pizza for that matter! Recently I decided to give them another chance and tried to order the meatball sliders. My boyfriend phoned in the order which they took, only to call him back 10 minutes later and tell him that they've taken the meatball sliders off the menu. They couldn't have told him that when he called and ordered it in the first place? Rude & unknowledgeable staff. They recently cut their menu in half, or more. They took everything that was good off! Baked ziti, gone! Quesadilla, gone! Chicken cordon bleu sliders, gone! Meatball sliders, gone! Chicago hotdog, gone! Pot roast, gone! I literally have no reason to ever return to this place again. Way to piss off & lose all your loyal customers Chicago Brewing Co.! Also, I think the old hag, rude, nasty female bartender who bar tends downstairs threw my iphone 6 in the garbage there & claimed that it was never found when I called right after I left! Also, the last time I was inside, I saw the upstairs male bartender (Not Josh) refuse to take a pregnant woman's food order because he was too busy serving hipsters alcohol. This place just doesn't care about it's customers."

We stuck with the HH menu - some Garlic Knots, Chicken Tenders, and of course, their draught beer. The knots were delicious and definitely a HH crowd pleaser. The chicken was pretty good; they were tender fingers, but even though we ordered them hot, I could almost detect no spiciness.\n\nTo wash down the food, I had a Blonde Ale, while my friend started with their Hardway IPA and then switched to the Blonde Ale. I found the Blonde Ale to be quite tasty. At $2.50 for 22oz, it's definitely a steal. I tried a sample of the IPA and it tasted like a solid IPA! I wasn't in the mood for something that hoppy, but I can see myself ordering it next time. I also had a sample of their blueberry and vanilla wheat. I'm glad I did the sample first because it wasn't something of which I'd want a whole glass. It reminded me of another beer I've tried in the past that tastes like Fruity Pebbles!\n\nWhat I truly appreciated about our visit today was the service that John provided us. It was just the little things he did to make sure we were happy. After all, it was happy hour. For example, when my friend ordered the IPA, he warned that it might be getting towards the bottom of the barrel, so he brought out a sample first. He also suggested that I get a sample of the blueberry and vanilla wheat first because other people have found it to be too strong in its fruitiness. I was actually going to ask for a sample, but he suggested it ahead of me. (And I'm really glad because I ended up not ordering it). He was also mindful of the fact that we were there for happy hour. He offered and came through by warning us when happy hour was almost over.\n\nI can't speak for their entire menu, but this place is certainly on my list of good happy hours. Oh wait, I need to update my list! It's a little out of my way, but I will definitely return if I'm in the area, especially since I've now decided to see all my films at Red Rock."

I imagine the chicken used is the pre-cooked, sliced strips you can buy at the grocery store (which, if you've ever had, is terrible). We picked most of it off or even had to just spit it on the plate. It lacked an adequate amount of sauce and the crust was about as good as crunchy cardboard. \n\nNot saying this place doesn't have other tasty options, but I certainly won't be back to try and find them."

And they don't discriminate either- they make beers in all colors and styles so all beer lovers can enjoy this place no matter what your preference.\n\nThe next best thing about this place is the staff. I have been coming here over 5 years and in that time they are one of the only restaurants I have ever seen maintain the level of quality in their products and the same staff. That says a lot about a restaurant. The staff is always friendly, on top of things and it doesn't matter when you come. I love that there is always room in the dining area even when it is busy you never feel ignored by he staff here.\n\nLastly I of course love the food here. Their menu is pretty varied so even if you want something different every time you come, that is possible here. They have everything from thin or thick crust pizza, to burgers, to steak, quesadillas, sandwiches, sweet potato fries and also full entrees and desserts. My favorite meal here is the chicken quesadilla with a side of sweet potato fries and nacho beer cheese! A lot of food but so worth it.

They were both pretty good.  I had the Chicago Dog, in order to fulfill my chicago cravings.  It was a good dog, but nothing like what you get at Wrigley.\nUpstairs is a smoking/cigar lounge.  Its a cool place to hang out, specially if you like cigars.  In terms of the service, it was to be expected.  The bartenders there were friendly and accommodating.  There isn't much more to ask for from an environment like this.  Either way, a pretty good place to grab a beer."

I was craving some great cracker thin, crispy style pizza. We ordered the artichoke dip to start. It had a nice cheesy layer on the top, which was piping hot, but the inside of the dip was not that hot, which leads me to believe this thing came straight from the freezer. Aside from it being unbelievably salty, the flavor was just bland. We also ordered the veggie thin crust pizza, that looked super nice but the only parts of the crust that were crispy were the edges, they didn't cook it long enough for the whole pizza crust to crisp throughout. The veggies seemed fresh enough, but there was barely any cheese and I felt like the sauce they used came straight from a can. The food was just meh, but the server was nice and they had a decent beer selection. My friend also left his phone there and they were honest and kept it at the bar for us. I would maybe consider going back to drink at the bar, but probably never eat here again."

Since she spoke so highly of it, I really wanted to try it.\n\nAt first glance, I was very impressed with the decor, but that's about the only thing that impressed me. My dining companion said that she only gets one thing when she dines at Chicago Brewing Company -- the Shrimp Cocktail. When they brought her plate of shrimp out(it was previously served in a cocktail glass), the first thing she said to me was \"the shrimp are smaller and the price went up since the last time I ate here.\"\n\nI wanted to try a Chicago Style Pizza and so I ordered one. The first one came out, I didn't like the sauce they used although the toppings were quite tasty (bacon and chicken) We asked if they would re-make the pizza this time using a white sauce and they obliged. The second one came out but was obviously under cooked. I had one piece of each pizza, a coke and just because I didn't eat much I ordered a root beer float.\n\nMy companion and I both left unsatisfied. Within less than an hour, I became physically ill. From reading the reviews here it seems like most of the people like the place but that was not our experience. Unfortunately, I can't agree with everyone else this time. In my opinion the food is mediocre at best and priced a bit on the high side. A complete and total waste of $40 and talk about something that will ruin someones day? Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I have posted an accurate, fair review. Thanks for taking the time to read. Hope your experience (if you decide to go here) is leaps and bounds better than mine was!\n\nIf the business owner is willing and should happen to see this review; I would graciously accept a refund but I don't believe you could ever convince me to return."

They take ziti, mozzarella, parmesan and fine marinara sauce and bake it right in to a deep dish pizza crust!  Fantastic.  The salad was good.  I got a beer but found it too warm.  I asked the server to make it colder so she brought a frozen mug to pour it in.  Didn't help much.  For $4 I would have preferred her bringing me a newer colder one."

I'm not a huge beer drinker and can't really tell the difference between a stout or an IPA, I can't tell which one had more hops and which one had more malt. I'm even worse at beer than wine (and I'm pretty bad at wine), so if you're looking for that, sorry.\n\nBut if you're looking for a food review, I just had the Chicago Chili Burger. This thing should have its own ZIP code. It's huge. They serve a huge patty open-faced -- not even trying to hide it, like, \"Oooh, we put a tiny bun on top so it looks bigger...\" No, it was like, \"MAN UP, SPARKY, THIS AIN'T OUR FIRST TIME AT THE RO-DEE-O.\" Then, on top of this delicious hunk of meat (the burger, not me) they pour on some sloppy, messy chili and green onions on top of it.\n\nThis is no sissy burger. This is not one of them chain restaurants \"Oh look we dropped a bit of chili on this burger\" burger. This is a burger that looks your daddy straight in the eye then makes out with your momma then slaps your sister upside the head while walking out your front door and fist-bumping with some very bad dudes.\n\nGrab your fork. This burger ain't here to f**k around.\n\nIt was a test, but it was also really good. The meat was juicy and tender, and the chili was really tasty. It was a sweeter chili, since of course it was Chicago-style, so I wish it had a little more spice to it, but that would be my only complaint. Otherwise, A+, gold star, attaboy.\n\nBUT WAIT! There's more!\n\nOne look at their dessert menu will give anyone a foodierection. I was looking at something called \"Blondie & Clyde\" which is like a mash-up of a brownie plus a butterscotch bar, but on the bottom of the page were their deep-fried treats. Elite Emily and I share a weird love/hate relationship with deep-fried anything, and she spotted the deep-fried carmel apple (which was either a caramel apple or an apple from Carmel, CA). Hector went with the deep-fried honey bun, and I couldn't be the odd man out, so I indulged in the deep-fried Ho-Ho.\n\nI loved mine... the deep-fried Ho-Ho reminded me of a chocolate chip donut bar, and the deep-fried honey bun was like a bear claw. But I was most impressed by the deep-fried carmel apple. As you bit into it, you heard a \"crunch.\" This is because somehow, after the apple is deep-fried, somehow it still comes out crisp and tart! It's really great, you have to try it to believe it.\n\nGreat place, I highly recommend it, under one condition: don't go see a movie right after it, because it's bound to lead to food coma."

The presentation was nice and had a fresh clam shell on the side of the bowl. The taste was okay but had a little too much pepper and more vegetables than I care for in my clam chowder.\n\nWe both got one of their micro-brews to drink. I ordered the Weizenheimer which is their hefeweizen. My wife got the black widow stout. Both were decent though we both preferred the beer the other ordered so we swapped.\n\nFor our entree we split the wild game sliders combo plate. It consisted of six different sliders: alligator, antelope, bison, rabbit, jackelope (antelope and rabbit), and wild boar. I was really excited to try all the different types of game but was underwhelmed. \n\nThe alligator tasted like seasoned salt and cumin and was a little heavy on the spices. The fried egg on top was a nice touch though.\n\nThe antelope was really dry and I had to choke it down. It had a licorice/anise taste to it.\n\nThe bison and jackelope sliders were also dry and not particularly memorable.\n\nThe rabbit had a very mild taste and wasn't as dry as some of the others.\n\nThe wild boar was my favorite. It was a little dry but the meat had a nice taste and wasn't masked by spices.\n\nThe sliders had animal toothpicks in them labeling what kind of meat they were which was a nice/cute touch.\n\nThe sliders were served with waffle-cut sweet potato fries. They were pretty good and not too sweet.\n\nNot sure if I'll go back. If I do, I'm gonna try something else."

I think their beer is pretty solid, and the happy hours prices are excellent. There are a few things that irked me, but we'll get to them. \n\nI was here with a pretty large party, so I suppose you should take that into account. Service wasn't exceptional, and maybe serving a large party affects that somewhat. The manager of the restaurant was extremely polite and accomodating, and I appreciate that. I don't regret celebrating here at all-- I'm glad I chose this place. I probably could have done just as well picking a big ol' corporate BJ's brewery or a Yardhouse, but as always, I give preference to smaller businesses and experience their unique spin on food. \n\nI tried their standard pale, which was very smooth but perhaps a bit uninspiring. Perhaps it could have been a bit more floral but it was very easy to drink and that is a plus. Their amber is sweet and comforting. Better than a bottle of Fat Tire no doubt. I also tried their brown ale. Slightly less malty than a New Castle, but again, fairly easy to drink. Trying these beers was fun and I would like to try more of them. The coconut porter looks especially tempting, so I'll have to save that for next time.\n\nMy food experience wasn't phenomenal, but it was decent enough I suppose. I ordered the italian beef sandwich, because my understanding is that its' an authentic Chicago food item. The meat was perhaps a tad more well done than I would have liked, and salty, but the Au Jois was adequate. The macaroni salad was pretty standard. The chicago pizza that others ordered looked pretty agreeable, and the Reuben looked delicious-- I think I will choose it next time. \n\nI think it's a bit silly that happy hour is not allowed in the dining area. Several from my party walked over to the bar and brought back beers at a much better price than the rest of us who had to order at full price. I don't quite see the purpose of this policy, but hey it's not my business. \nFor my birthday, a complementary chocolate pizookie was served.  I am partial to chocolate but it was honestly pretty damn good, and I do appreciate gestures such as this. \n\nSo how does this place stack up to a BJ's or Yardhouse? Probably about even. I'd give them a 3.5, rounded up to 4 because of that personal touch, and the novelty of brewing their own beers. I WOULD certainly recommend this place for an event , just manage your expectations I suppose. It was a cool looking, fun environment to celebrate in and I thank them for helping me have a fun night."

The menu said it was topped with beer cheese and I'm not a huge fan of beer, but we tried it anyway. I didn't like it much, but it was all right. I probably wouldn't order them again, but if my boyfriend wanted to, I'd munch on the fries on the bottom that didn't have much (or any) cheese on them, which is what I did that day.\n\nWe both tried the country fried filet mignon. I didn't really like the mashed potatoes -- they were sour for some reason. I've had mashed potatoes like that and I'm not sure what it is in them that makes it taste that way, but I don't like it much. The meat was kinda tough and dry; the fried batter just fell right off. I just felt like I was eating a kind of dry steak and some chips.\n\nAs for service, the staff was nice. However, we got the wrong drinks three times. We had a guy that was in training as our server, but I don't blame him for this. The first time, my boyfriend ordered I think a 16oz beer, but the bartender poured him a 20z, which he said was fine. Then a waitress refilled my raspberry iced tea with unsweetened iced tea. I let our server know what happened and he got me a refill of the right drink. Lastly, my boyfriend was trying to ask our server for the hefeweizen before he walked away; however, he had already swiftly walked out of earshot. The busser was handing us our plates of food and heard my boyfriend, so he said he'd send the server back our way. The server was nice enough to return with a beer, but it was a refill of the same beer. I'm guessing the busser just told him my boyfriend wanted another beer, but didn't specify which or did not indicate that the server should come and ask. He also could've, but the server didn't bother to. Can't really know for sure, so I can't say who's responsible.\n\nThe place didn't seem that busy as there were empty tables, so I don't think that was the problem. I think they need to work on communicating or fulfilling orders a bit more. Overall, it was decent. We're not sure if we're going to come back, but if so, it won't be because we enjoyed the food. I'm willing to give them another chance, though."

You walk in, straight ahead is what I'd call the well lit main dining area, the the left behind the doors is the darker bar area, can get food in there too, then upstairs from that is the cigar room. We choose the bar area, sat at a table and was immediately served by a friendly woman. Not bad so far. Menu is the pretty standard bar food, peppered with 'Chicago' styled food, pizza, sandwiches, etc. I tried a Ramblin Reck amber ale, a very tasty house draft, highly recommended. Also ordered the Chicago Italian Beef and the wife got a cheese pizza.\nThe issue here was the food service. A lot of what we ordered came out wrong, I would not recommend the coleslaw (too dry, like cabbage and nothing else) nor the fries (limp). The pizza was good as was the Italian beef. \nI may give it another shot one day, at the very least, to enjoy a few of those Ramblin Recks."

The six sliders are made from the following game animals:  alligator, antelope, buffalo, jackalope (rabbit and antelope meat mixed together), rabbit and wild boar.  They come 3 for $16 (must be all one kind of meat) or a sampler platter of all 6 for $30.\n\nThree of us shared the sampler and we each had a taste of all 6 meats.  My rating would be from best to least: Rabbit, wild boar, alligator, antelope, jackalope, and bison.  All had sauces to enhance the flavors of the meat.  For example, the wild boar had red currant jelly and sharp cheddar cheese while alligator had a remoulade sauce and a fried egg.  There was a toothpick to break the yolk and make the alligator meat really flavorful!  The platter also came with some waffle cut sweet potato fries which were really yam fries--not sweet potato.  This was a good choice, and I'm glad Tony and Clint shared the sampler with me.\n\nService was good, and I had a mug of their on site brewed root beer.  Another great UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) with a nice bunch of people at a good place.\n\nPhoto of the six sliders with the animal depictions on the toothpicks:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA?select=1iaD27IslbUgrrdPt1O2sg"

The pizzas that I've had are good, although, I have to wonder what they mean by thin crust, Chicago pizza.  I don't think the menu writer has been to Chicago.  As to the idea of eating anything other than the pizza, forget it.\n\nOn a recent trip to Chicago Brewing, we got the steak sandwich and the Huli chicken sandwich.  The steak sandwich comes on a large roll with the steak inside smothered in some sort of mayonnaise based glop.  You would have to unhinge your jaw to take a bite.  No problem though, the greasy stuff they coat the steak with acts as a lubricant and with only a slight tilt, the top slides right off.  After I scraped off as much of the oily mess as possible, I took my first bite. I found the meat sufficiently tough that it would take a school of Piranhas about a week to consume.  Resorting to a knife, I chiseled my way to a second bite only to discover I was eating a solid piece of gristle.  Disgusting.  My waitress agreed and I was spared paying for this tribute to the lowest consumable grade of meat the USDA permits restaurants to legally serve. \n\nThen there was the Chicken sandwich.  It was so dry that I do not believe it could have been served in a place where smoking is permitted due to the imminent fire hazard posed by the flammable material found in the bun.  The skin on the chicken could not be pierced by anything short of an industrial laser, although,  I'm certain that any Texan would love to have a pair of boots made of this stuff.  Eating it, however, is out of the question.\n\nGo to Chicago Brewing for beer and pizza and avoid getting too adventurous when ordering from the menu."

Now like the name states this is a working brewing company and they have about 10 of their own beers. I always get the Black Star or Black Spider (can't remember the name) stout.

            "review": "I don't want to stray from my burger reviews with so many places in town yet to try, but I feel compelled to talk about an interesting meal I had last week.  My girlfriend and I wanted to try something different for dinner, and I quickly remembered hearing about the wild game sliders that they serve over at the Chicago Brewing Company. One thing I like almost as much as burgers is trying weird and new foods, this promised to do just that.\n\nWhile I suppose I should come back to try their burger at some point, this establishment is more on the 'typical' pub food side, and isn't necessarily on the top of my list for burgers to review. Still, the wild game aspect was intriguing enough to drag me in. The interior of the restaurant as well as the bar side are nothing fancy, pretty standard faire for a local restaurant. We went there on a random week night around 6pm, and quickly decided that based on the large amount of families and screaming kids the bar side would be better for our needs. Even though there are high top tables away from the bar itself, you can still anticipate a smoky atmosphere with mediocre service. We waited a bit too long to get our menus and first drinks, but after that it wasn't too bad.\n\nThere are six wild game sliders on the CBC's menu, each paired with what the chef believes to be the perfect complement to that meat's flavoring. You have the option of trying 3 of one style, or all 6 for a little less than twice the price. Based on a slider meal we had a couple days earlier, we knew that 6 sliders between the two of us would be more than enough and would allow us to divulge in all flavors.\n\nHere's the rundown:\n\nAlligator: from what I'm told alligator meat has very little flavor, so it is always seasoned to give whatever dish it is served as more character. Having a connotation with the cuisine of the south, this one is quite over seasoned with Cajun flavors. Don't get me wrong, they're good, but you really don't get an idea of what alligator tastes like based on this. The soft egg, Remoulade, and other toppings paired well with this.\n\nAntelope: almost too gamey for my liking, but quite good. The meat was pretty much what I anticipated it to taste like. Again the jalapeno jelly and toppings all paired quite well with it. The meat might have been a tiny bit dry, but I'm not sure how much of that is a natural trait of antelope meat as opposed to it being a slider which is always inherently dry.\n\nBison: I'm always a big fan of bison meat, and this didn't disappoint. I buy bison steaks quite often at Whole Foods, and have also been known to make a great bison burger with some of the ground bison meat from Smith's. Unfortunately we're not treated with different toppings for the remainder of the meats I will mention, but as I've stated already they paired well so why mess with a good thing.\n\nJackelope: possibly one of my favorites of the bunch. Wasn't sure what to expect with this one, but it turned out to be a great mix of two different meats, a little sweet with just the right amount of gamey. This one definitely stood out for me.\n\nRabbit: could have been my least favorite of the group. It seemed very gamey, stiff and dry, which I've heard should not be the case with rabbit meat. The dryness I could tack on to the slider size always being impossible to cook (see my review of Slidin' Thru coming soon), but I can't explain the gamey taste. Neither of us were really a fan, I think it was the only one that had a bite or so leftover.\n\nWild boar: a favorite of both of us. Picture a sausage patty, but the tastiest, purest form of that. I may not have gotten my full half of this one because someone else also really liked it, but what I had I enjoyed quite a bit.\n\nOverall this meal was a lot of fun, the little signs on each patty are a great touch, and it's an easy way for the commoner to try something 'exotic' while still sticking with a familiar form. If you're feeling a little adventurous and want to try something different, definitely give them a visit. Their beer isn't so bad either."

I love pizza, it just does bad things to my blood sugar, and Chicago Pizza, although tasty, does extra bad things.  I enjoy eating a few bites here and there from my husband so I can get my fix.  In a place like this, I try to reserve my carbs for the beer.\n\nWe ordered the following:\nThe beer sampler - we wanted to try everything so we could decide what we wanted to order (I loved the Weizenheimer and Matt ordered the Black Star Stout)\nBrew Wings - Ordered hot, but really weren't hot at all.  They still were crunchy, huge, and just overall yummy.  Some of the best I've had in town.  Instead of celery and blue cheese dressing it had a celery salad which was really cool, crisp and refreshing and I loved it.  Very creative and original.\nBaby Brew Salad - I ordered this with a Balsamic Reduction Vinaigrette.  For a side salad this was huge, fresh and delicious.\nDeep Dish Meat Lovers Pizza - Matt substituted garlic for Canadian Bacon, not sure why he doesn't like Canadian Bacon since it is just essentially ham!  The whole time he was eating this all he could say was \"wow, this is so good.\"  He was very very happy with the pizza here and this might be his favorite.\n\nI'm not sure how often we'll go here since it is, as I said, not really near where we live.

However, with the regular hot wings being so mild I am thinking that they will be mild as well.  I shall have to work myself up to it next time. \n\nOh by the way, the beer is wonderful!  Nice to find a place in town that has the beer towers again after The Pub at Monte Carlo stopped serving them."

There goes $10. \n\nI also ordered the garlic knots. Now those were pretty good. However, the menu on yelp said it would be $5 but when I got the bill, it was $8.

It's not anything I've felt compelled to do before, but after the experience I had at the Chicago Brewing Company I feel like it's my civic duty to warn others. We are new to the area, and after perusing menus online we chose the Chicago Brewing Company for our first outing because the menu we saw said they had wild game sliders. After we were seated we discovered they were no longer on the menu. We should have left then, but we'd already ordered a beer so we decided to stay. Instead I ordered the steak sandwich. My husband ordered the filet mignon sliders, and we got a couple of kids meals for our children. My husband and children's meals were bland, forgettable, and overpriced. How I wish I had anything that good to report about my steak sandwich. \n\nI love steak sandwiches. Anytime I see one on a menu I order it. This was the worst steak sandwich I've ever had. I had no idea they could even be bad until I had that one. I ordered my steak medium, and when it arrived it was so rare it was purple. I like rare steak, so I didn't send it back. The steak was much smaller than the roll it was served on, it had a pile approximately three inches thick of the white, flavorless part of a head of iceberg lettuce, and it was drowned in so much garlic aioli that it basically tasted like a garlic sandwich. You could barely taste the steak, which was too bad because maybe if we could have we would have realized it was rotten. The steak was covered with so much melted cheese that it appeared as though the Blob were attempting to digest it. At least the Blob could have digested it. My husband and I could not. My sandwich was so terrible that I gave it to my husband, who ate the steak only in an attempt to at least get our $14 worth out of the meal. We aren't generally complainers, and our waitress was nice, so we said nothing, tipped our waitress, left, and walked around the Village Square shopping center. I stayed longer, but my husband went home, where he proceeded to get violently ill. I hadn't eaten nearly as much of the sandwich as he had, so it took a little longer for my food poisoning to kick in. \n\nLater that night I called the restaurant to tell them so they wouldn't serve the steak to anyone else. The kitchen manager told me it takes six hours for food poisoning to kick in, which is a lie. He said the general manager would call back the next day. That was also a lie. I decided to look the Chicago Brewing Company up on Yelp, and that was when I noticed four other people complaining about being sickened by this restaurant. That makes me number five, and that's just five who bothered reporting it to Yelp. God knows how many people have actually gotten sick from this place. It's clear they must be keeping their food around long after it should have been tossed out. It's a tiny restaurant and it seems to mostly just be a place to eat while you are gambling, so their food turnover is probably not that high on certain items--one of which I'm going to assume is the steak. \n\nIt's not a coincidence that people are getting sick there. Save your money and go somewhere else. Anywhere else. Ordering the Doritos Tacos Locos at the Taco Bell next door is less likely to sicken you and ruin the rest of your weekend, and that's saying a lot."

The waitress came by right away to take drink orders.  They had a blueberry vanilla ale on the menu, but when we ordered it, the waitress said they didn't have it, and then recommended some sort other beer with mango.  I ordered that just because it sounded interesting, and it was pleasantly surprising.  However, I do not recommend drinking this if you are going to be eating a full dinner.  The beer was full bodied and filling.  We also ordered a brewtus which was a 50 ounce glass filled with a beer of your choice for $15.  (You get to keep the glass.)  We chose the All Nighter which we all shared and enjoyed.  I think the best part about the brewtus was that refills were only $5!  Food-wise, everyone seemed satisfied with their food.  The artichoke dip and alfredo pizza were the two things that I found to be really good.  The service was really good here.  By the time we ordered, the place got busy but the waitress still made it a point to come by every few minutes to check on us.  I'd like to come back for their happy hour.  I glanced over their menu and they had some pretty good deals going on for their beer, well-drinks, wine, and munchies."

The pizza was thin crust and $5 you are better off going to little Caesar's. It was OK but so small and thin the $5 just didn't seem well spent. The pretzel bites came with  weird tasting cheese; me and my friends couldn't figure out if it was just some weird pasteurized melted cheese or plain bad. We avoided dipping pretzels bites in it and opted for ranch/mustard instead. The garlic knots were much better and very big, they were actually the best thing on the menu. The sangria was also pretty good and I believe only $5-6 it came in a big glass as well with fresh fruit; delicious!!!! Will be back for the drink happy hour, it was worth it, but my advice is eat before you come otherwise prepare for dissapointment."

I only eat meat sparingly and could not pass up the Trio of Filet Mignon Sliders appetizer (three broilded tenderloin filets topped w/ saut\u00e9ed mushrooms & onions). The light and fluffy bread melted in my mouth along with the perfectly cooked Filet Mignon meat.\n\nTo save room for the beer, I chomped on a light Asian Ahi Salad (rare seared Ahi Tuna, mixed greens, toasted cashews, daikon sprouts, fresh tomatoes, w/ a Wasabi PlumVinaigrette).The Ahi Tuna was perfect and the dressing was good enough to bath in! So yummy! \n\nSadly I only had enough room for the one beer but was eyeing the 50oz glass for my collection..next time.

Beyond that, the place seemed generally cheerless with a scattered assortment of that discomforting and singularly Vegasian type of the damned you run into occasionally off the Strip, not quite consigned to the clear, uncontested merit of hell, but somehow more vague and less defined--purgatorial or limbo-esqu--half plowed, engaged in chain smoking and vapid, pointless, loud conversation, or even worse, simply voiding any meaningful existence, head down, playing countertop video poker machines. The beer was certainly decent and what food came out of the kitchen looked adequate (at best). As a friend noted hours later after we'd left and found ourselves five minutes into a visit to Big Dog's Brewery, \"I already like this place a hundred times better than the Chicago Brewing Company.\" Woof."

            "review": "Had some time to kill, so I stopped in here to grab a bite to eat and watch the Cowboys vs Eagles Sunday night football game.  It has been over 5 yrs since I last visited this place and have heard a lot of good things about it, so I figured it was time.  I'm glad I did!\n\nThe waiter brought over the menu and as I turned through each page I got more and more excited......2 pages dedicated to Sliders, what?!!  I love Sliders!  Yes, it's true....two whole pages (see pics).  One page has exotic style sliders....ie Alligator, etc.  The other page has some unique ones.....I decided on getting a 6-pack ($15) which allows you to select 2 styles of Sliders.  I chose the Black and Blue (Black Angus w/Cajun Spices, Blue Cheese Crumbles, Caramelized Onions, & Chipotle Mayo)  and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (Grilled Chicken, Honey Baked Ham, Swiss Cheese & Honey Mustard Sauce).  However, I was extremely curious about the Ghost Sliders, which has Ghost Sauce, made from the world's hottest pepper....the Ghost Pepper.  Plus there's an entire 1/2 page on the menu dedicated to items prepared with Ghost Pepper!\n\nAs most of my friends know, I love spicy food.....but have never tried anything with Ghost Pepper before.  As a reference point, Habanero Peppers are 350,000 on the Scoville Scale, which measures spiceness.  Ghost Pepper registers 1,000,000+ on the Scoville Scale!\n\nI asked the waiter if I could have a side of the Ghost Sauce so I could try it out.  He said sure.....however, he didn't tell me I'd get charged an extra $1 for that....which kind of irks me.  Keep that in mind if you decide to order a side of it.\n\nTo wash it down, I had a Hardway IPA ($3)....that's right $3 for a 20 oz glass!\n\nAfter a few minutes the 6-pack of Sliders came out as well as the Ghost Sauce.  I wanted to try the Ghost Sauce before the food, so I took a toothpick and dipped the tip into the Sauce.....it burned the hell out of my tongue!  That is seriously H-O-T!  It's no joke!  But that's what I enjoy!\n\nSo....I took a Chicken Cordon Bleu Slider and dipped a little Ghost Sauce on it and took a bite.....yum!  It was great!  Perfect proportion of Ham & Chicken.....they complimented each other well.  The Bun was soft and fresh.....again, perfect.  Next I tried the Black and Bleu Slider.....it was just as good.  Although I could have had it without the Red Onion....I'm not a fan of grilled Red Onions...oh well, next time I get them without it.\n\nI'm glad I ordered the IPA because I needed it to put the 5 alarm fire out in my mouth.  I also ordered a glass of Blueberry Vanilla Wheat ($2) after I was done with the IPA....it was also very good and cheap!  Can't get over how cheap the Beer was!\n\nOverall, it was an awesome experience.  Good food, good Beer, and I lost my Ghost Pepper virginity!\n\nOther things worth mentioning.....there's a 7 lb Burger challenge, yes 7 LBS!  If you can eat it in less than 12 min and change, then you get it named after you.  Believe it or not, it's been done before.  No way I could do that!\n\nWill I return?  As the Macho Man Randy Savage would say......Oh Hell Ya!"

The service was pretty good, attentive and fast. The food was pretty good as well. Had the veggie pizza and it was to die for. Typically don't take leftovers home, but did this time because the pizza was so good. \n\nNow I wont just look at this place as a great place to have a good beer on the weekend or after work.

My first trip was my first night in town and we enjoyed the happy hour beer and food.\n\nUnfortunately, my second trip tonight was somewhat disappointing.  The host was awesome and had a great attitude and smile, however when we got to our table the service was lacking in many ways. \n\nThe tall guy (wont say his name out of respect) seemed like he was bored and freaked out by the 4 tables he had to wait on.  We returned our pizza twice to ask the to finish cooking it, I ask three times for ketchup for my fries, and he totally forgot our sweet potato fries and when I brought it to his attention he mumbled something and then walked off to the kitchen never to say another word about them.  Here is a clue \" I am sorry I forgot to put your order in\" would have been appropriate.\n\nSo...not sure what to make of this place, but I hope that if I decide to come again, the service and food steps up a notch or two\n\nGives Chicago a bad name....."

The service was incredible & very fast. But to put icing on the cake, the Bay Breeze I got was the best in town. Perfect ratio.

Actually I always look for Brew pubs around any area I travel to and try to taste different beers.  I stopped in for lunch and some beers.  I sat at the bar positioning myself to see the Red Sox game.  There are plenty of big screens in this place and they have all the games.  The restaurant was divided between restaurant and bar, smoking was allowed in the bar but not in the restaurant.  This was a clean and cozy place which had an upstairs lounge,  The bar  had about 8-9 beers of their own beer on tap and I started off with the Ramblin Wreck amber ale.  This was a nice refreshing beer, ice cold and ran about 4.5% alcohol.  I then scoped the menu and quickly honed in the Filet Mignon Sliders, the thought of fillet sliders made me forget about the other things on the menu although I did see  Cheese Knots on the appetizer menu.......hmmm.  So, I ordered the sliders and my next beer reluctantly passing on the garlic-cheese knots(next time....).  Being a \"hop-head\", I ordered the Hard Play IPA.  Though not as strong as I thought, this beer had plenty of hops.\nBeing a Sunday afternoon, there were several locals playing video poker at the bar and some just getting plastered on Jaeger bombs at 1:30 in the afternoon.  After the barkeep carded and shooed away two under aged kids, he brought out my trio of goodness.  There sat in front of me three sliders made from fillet mignon loin, grilled onions and mushrooms served with au jus.  So I started to dig in, man what an experience and guess what I had three of these little morsels to satisfy me.  Too bad I was pressed for time or else I would have tried more of their beers.  This is a good place to hang out and the service was great.  I would definitely stagger back in here, even though it's about 11 miles from the stip.  In fact I might just drag the Buffet Boys to this place next month, when we take over Vegas.  Look for Buffet Boys invade Vegas.........................\nOh yeah, the concert that's another story.............."

It appears the restaurant may be under new management, as there is now an imposing man who \"helicopters\" the restaurant like a hawk, making diners uncomfortable.  The menu has been completely scrapped for items that we can find at any chain restaurant, meaning that our favorites are no longer available.  It's a shame that after 10 years of eating here, we'd actually walk out... but that's what it came down to last Saturday after witnessing the manager berate our waiter in full view over something that wasn't his fault.  Not worth going into detail, but our disappointment had absolutely nothing to do with any of the wait staff.  I hope the owner's recognize and resolve the issue."

My groupon came with a burger, and all I can say was holy cow, the thing was both ridiculous and awesome. Was huge (about 7 or so inches in diameter, 3/4\" thick patty IIRC) , had barbecue sauce and onion rings on top. Was pretty darn good. \n\nNow I would agree with my friend David S.'s review, between that and their normal bar food if I were a nearby resident I would have a hard time visiting on a frequent basis because the food is all just too much.

First, it was under-done, but more, it was like a biscuit dough, not a bread/pizza dough.  A really strange consistency.  I've always enjoyed their pizzas downtown, this was not that.

All of them were excellent! I like trying breweries and craft brews everywhere I visit, and I usually find that each brewery has a couple of really good beers and a few not so good. At  Chicago brewing company, I did not try a single mediocre beer! This may be the best brewery I've been to, as the beers are across the board good, especially the triple and quadruple, which I hope they make permanent items. I typically do not like beers with fruit, so I ordered just a sample of the blueberry wheat. It was good, and the blueberry taste was neither fake nor overpowering. The food was decent, which is more of a bonus for me with a brewery. I had the happy hour chicken tenders, which were quite good. I then ordered some sliders, but I was so full from chicken tenders and beers, that I couldn't do much damage there. The sweet potato fries are waffle fries, and decent. The sliders were good too. My only disappointment was with the staff. The service was excellent, but when you go to a beer place, you expect to be surrounded by beer fanatics. Apparently the servers have a mild interest in beer at best. I still highly recommend this place to any beer connoisseur! You will not be disappointed."

You can get a pitcher of beer for $6.00; you can get pints and so forth with happy hour prices, but $6.00 pitchers have won my heart.  My two favorite brews at the moment are the All Nighter and the Weisenheimer.  Also notable are their chicken tenders on the happy hour menu, which is $6.00 and includes around 8-10 pieces of chicken.  Sauce options are mild, medium, hot, BBQ and I think maybe one more option; chicken is served with ranch and a celery/coleslaw hybrid kind of salad that I'm not too crazy about.  I'd rather have plain celery sticks.\n\nI would say that if I'm ever in the area during happy hour, I would recommend going to this bar.  But that would be a lie, since this past Friday my friends and I were on Fremont Street and I STILL recommended this place for happy hour.

The beer here is brewed on site and has won several awards at the Great American Beer Festival and The World Beer Cup. Did I try any beer? Nope! Another visit I will though ;)\n\nWe sat in a comfy booth in the dining area. Our server was very nice and checked on us often and went over any questions we had. The menu had so many good choices so hubby and I decided to pick out 2 different things to share. We ordered the \"Buffalo Chicken Wrap\" priced at $10 and the \"South Side Cheese Steak\" priced at $10 with a $3 up charge for the substitution of onion rings instead on fries.\n\nBuffalo Chicken Wrap - The chicken tenders are handmade and tossed in hot sauce then put into a tortilla with lettuce, tomato and chipotle ranch. I asked them to leave the lettuce out. The chicken was all white and cooked perfectly. The whole wrap would have been good to me if the hot sauce wasn't on it. It wasn't hot at all and tasted like straight up vinegar. The portion was great and the fries that came with it were delicious. I asked for a side of ranch to dip my fries in and the ranch was cold, thick and delicious. Hubby thought the wrap was OK, but this isn't something I personally would order again unless is was minus the funky vinegar flavor. \n\nSouth Side Cheese Steak - This has beef with peppers, mushrooms, and onions, with their our own signature beer cheese sauce. This sandwich was just delicious! The steak was tender and flavorful, the peppers and onions cooked just right and the beer cheese sauce makes this sandwich a match made cheese steak heaven! The onion rings were beer battered and yummy! I could easily just eat a plate of the onion rings!\n\nHappy Hour is daily from 4 - 7 pm. HH is only available in the beer garden, loft and lounge according to their menu.\n\nWhile there we noticed a promotion for \"Slot August Nights\" where you can stop in and enter to win a 1966 Ford Mustang! You can enter at their other locations Magoos, Loose Caboose, Golden West and of course here at Chicago Brewing Company. Just ask your server for details."

Not that I'm that old, but it looks like something from Boardwalk Empire.  \nAs I entered, the front waiting area was filled with a pungent aroma of cigar smoke mixed with hookah tobacco.  I immediately noticed the size of brewing vats, bigger than hip -hop, to the right as we were led to our table.  The smell of smoke dissipated as we neared our table until it was only the smell of pizza fresh from the oven.  \n\nThe waiter was pretty awesome, no complaints about the staff at all.   We ordered a 2 pitchers of the sweet nectar known as beer.  The Weizenheimer came in a pitcher that looked like sweet golden honey, but upon tasting it we realized something had gone horribly wrong with the beer.  The beer tasted like Juicy Fruit Bubblegum, bleeehhh!  We set this one aside and poured out attention into the Ramblin' Reck Amber Ale.  Mmmm, the amber ale was a tasty brew!  \n\nI ordered a BBQ burger which was surprisingly dry and the BBQ sauce burned my lips like hot lava from Mt. Vesuvius!   I waited for it to cool down slightly while focusing on my fries which weren't bad and went deliciously with the fine ketchup they had available.  \n\nI would visit this place again, but I would definitely avoid the wheat beer like the plague.  How this beer won awards in 2004 boggles my mind like an enigma wrapped in duct tape so much that you can't even tell what it is anymore.  3 stars for gross beer and dry burgers."

Some were better than others but they were all good.  We each ordered a glass of our favorite and had a plate of garlic knots, which were also good.  The service was fast and friendly and I noticed they had an upstairs area along with the bar and main restaurant.

However, yesterday we had someone named Tara who was really sweet and nice. \n\nI know all the food is pretty fresh. If it's available the coco for coconuts porter is amazing.  Also I'd highly recommend the ribeye sandwich ( it's huge) , any of the burgers, chicken sandwich, and the New England clam chowder( I think it's a Friday night thing).  Also they make a ghost pepper hot sauce that's not on the menu if you like your wings scorching. \n\nAnyways for the price, you can't go wrong here honestly."

            "review": "I read some great reviews several months back and but it on my backburner to try.  Looking in the most recent reviews today I should have checked out the place sooner.  Really, a borderline 3 for this place.\n\nWe got there on a Friday night and it was a bit packed.  Decor is nice, dark, lots of brick.  Liked seeing the huge vats for their in house microbrews, real plus.  But really folks, does it take you 10 minutes to acknowledge that we might need a place to sit?  Naughty, naughty you hostess you!  On a Friday night you know business will pick up so be on the ready!\n\nAfter finally getting seated we were greeted by our server.  Nice guy.  Told him we had never been there before so he showed us the menu and told us about their house microbrews and some of his favorites.  I told him I like dark beers like Guiness but I also don't mind a more medium brew like a Newcastle.  He told me I should have both!  His suggestion: 1/2 of their Old Town Brown and 1/2 of their Black Star Stout!  Also known in many places as a Black and Tan!  At $5 for a 22 oz. glass how could I go wrong?  Turned out to be a great choice, malty beer with chocolate notes, and a light bitter finish.  Fantastic!\n\nI get around to looking into the menu and behold what do I see?  Chicago's master brewer...is a Filipino!  Graduate from UNLV no less!  That's it...go Filipino go!  Nice job Mr. Pascual on making some killer beer!  Makin' our Asian community strong, one person at a time.  Glad he got a page for him on the menu.  \n\nOn to the dinner menu, lots of variety!  Definitely bar food in the works for sure.  Appetizers looked appealing, garlic knots, onion rings, chicken tenders, brew wings, calamari, mussels, and clams.  So much to choose from.  If I had been there in time for happy hour we would have sampled some of these.  Menu has a diverse selection, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, entrees, and pizzas both Chicago deep dish and thin crust.  They even have a section devoted to their popular sliders.\n\nWe thought about getting a specialty Chicago deep dish pizza at first but it was a bit pricy at $14 for a 9\" (man did they look tiny sitting on the warming line) and $24 for a 14\".  You can also build your own deep dish pizza if you like.  Maybe next time!\n\nThe lady and I both ended up getting sandwiches from their menu.  She got the Hot Pastrami Sandwich ($10) with thin pastrami, coleslaw, Swiss cheese, and honey mustard on marble rye bread.  I got the Southside Cheesesteak ($10) with peppers, mushrooms, and onions on a French roll with their signature beer cheese sauce.  The lady had onion rings, and I had fries (asked for them to be well done).\n\nThe verdict?  Food was ah.  It was ok, but nothing to really write home about.  Nothing was really all that special.  Her pastrami sandwich was alright, but it wasn't exactly overflowing with meat, and the coleslaw was a bit bland.  The onion rings didn't seem super fresh, do I detect from a bag and not hand battered?  Oh goodness I hope not.  My cheesesteak was fine (I've had better), their signature beer cheese sauce had a hint of beer but mostly tasted like basic Cheez Whiz to me.  Does no one know how to toast the inside of bread before putting the meat on it?  That crunch makes a world of difference.  My fries on the other hand were very good.  Super crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.  \n\nAn ok experience overall.  Hostess could have been better, but our server was A-OK.  I must go back just to sample more of their beers!  The food though, might need some improvement.  Plus a star though for their Filipino master brewer!"

The huge Chicago sign outside of the attractive building is what drew our attention to it... then, of course, discovering that it was a nearby microbrew, well, how could we resist?\n\nI love microbrews... and I enjoy trying them out from the different regions of the country. When we first sat down, we were greeted by a very knowledgeable waitress who helped us through the beer menu. We started our evening with the nine-beer sampler for $9. This gave us a chance to warm up to all of the local offerings. After working our way through them all, my wife and I both chose our favorites.\n\nNext came the food. We ordered the spinach and artichoke appetizer. Sure, you've had this in other places, like your neighborhood chain restaurants, but this one takes the cake. It was a huge portion and the flavor was nothing short of spectacular. If you like spinach and artichoke, this appetizer must be on your list of things to get here.\n\nWe then looked over the good-sized menu. There was a decent amount of things to choose from, but given the name of the place, we were immediately drawn to the deep dish pizza. I mean, with a name like \"Chicago\" how can we go wrong with deep dish pizza?\n\nWe chose correctly!\n\nThe deep dish pizza was some of the best I have had, and unlike other places that specialize in this style of pizza, it arrived to the table a little faster than I expected, which gave it a little time to cool down, which was good, because it was piping hot when the waitress arrived with it.\n\nThe dough was perfect. The cheese was real and it was perfect. The sauce was homemade - and one of several you could choose from - and the pepperoni was spicy and plentiful. Definitely a good choice if you like deep dish.\n\nWe finished our food, drank our beers and the waitress cleaned out the pint glasses - which had the restaurant's logo on them - and we got to take them home with us.\n\nIf you're in this area of Las Vegas and you have a little time, I strongly recommend visiting this place... it'll fill you up and it won't set you back a whole lot of money either."

I'm a fan of the stout beer and for $4 - it's a really great deal.\n\nChicago's is not a trendy place nor is it a dive - but you'll get a consistent, reasonably priced meal every time you go."

CBC easily had the best happy hour in town but that recently changed when they got rid of their late night happy hour and shifted their regular happy hours to 3:00pm to 6:00pm. Aside from the terrible hour shift the happy hour still does provide some delicious beer on the cheap. Six Dollar pitchers by itself would be a pretty good deal but the quality of the beer brewed at Chicago brewery puts this happy hour over the top. Their Old Town Brown being my favorite, they offer a variety of beer to match just about any taste.\n\nOn the food end of things, I can't say I'm too experienced. I've usually stuck with the run of the mill bar food. The chicken fingers are easily one of my favorite in town. They're very lightly battered, none of this extremely crispy business you get from other places. They're decently sized and the Brew-BQ flavor is delicious, and a major plus is that they are discounted during happy hour along with the drinks. I've also had an above average hamburger there, nothing spectacular but it's definitely satisfying.\n\nOverall a great place to have some good bar food and good beer. My only complaint is that they need to bring back the late night happy hour and shift their current happy hour an hour back so that it ends at 7:00pm instead of 6:00pm. 6:00pm just seems too early for a happy hour but maybe I'm just spoiled because of the hours that the previous happy hour ran."

When the drinks arrived, there was no sugar and no spoon to stir with. When we asked for sugar, they bring us sweetner. The waitress stated that they don't have sugar, but we have raw sugar. Really. Next we ordered the calamari, pretzel bites, and the molten chocolate a la mode. And of course, the calamari was like chewing on a rubber band.

Like most people I have interfered with a potential playoff home run baseball, rode the back of Bill Cartwright, never ate at anything Michael Jordan owned, threw up deep dish pizza in a drunken haze, and snagging some cheap chick from Tinley Park in the bathroom of Exedus II. (We all know they are the easiest chicks in the Metro area...gotta love the na\u00efve suburbs.)  You know, the usual things any one does in Chicago.\n\nAll of those good memories came flooding back to me when I passed the Chicago Brewing Company. A wave of emotions hit me...I almost hit my hearse into a bus full of nuns...almost reliving another Chicago memory I have tried to hard to forget. The smell of burning Habit is really oft putting and not one you forget easily...but I digress...\nI sauntered into the bar a few months ago ready to smash any of those Chicago loving goons for just looking at me wrong, and what I found was a really nice place to eat, a great bar and some good food.\nFirst, the downstairs dining room.  Sometimes your old pal Rex has a hard time getting up and down stairs. That damn keyboard cleaner really throws off your balance when you huff two cans.  So, I decided to eat where it was most convenient.  The one legged hooker with dysentery appreciated it...all that shaking from the hoping up the stairs can produce some horrible results.   She got a chicken sandwich with hot sauce and I got a cobb salad, a corn cob screwed up my partial plate. Remember kids...always brush at least once a week, I wish my 6 foster mothers told me that instead of what a loser I was.  Anyway...the cob salad is gigantic. It is a great salad. Chicken, bacon, avocado, egg, you name it. All fresh, all well seasoned and all very good.  Jasmine, if that was her real name, told me the sandwich was very hot, I wouldn't touch anything she touched but next time I tried it and I thought it was excellent. Big piece of chicken fried and covered with hot sauce.  There could have been more sauce because the bun was a little dry.  I ate several times down there and all the food was good, the waitress service was great and I never had a time where I wanted to start slicing up the booth with my steak knife. A good sign. The food was always good, but nothing they did was ever great other than the salad...wondering about the pizza...keep reading...\n\nThe bar upstairs is where things get fun.  There are a few tv's, some high top tables and chairs and a great little lounge area.  Good times on the weekend if you like the yuppie crowd. Rex doesn't. Perfect for discussing what is easily the best part of this place...the beer. Ah, the beer. They brew their own beer and it is good.  Despite burning my tongue on a tailpipe...don't ask...I could taste all the hoppy goodness.  They have a pale ale and go always up to a nice dark beer. Fruit beers, the blueberry one I tried, was good but not great, other than that they were damn good brews.\n\nRex will end this on a bad note, just like his 4 marriages, 8 colleges, 19 stops in state run facilities and the one time he met Kyle Petty.  The deep dish pizza sucks! Not just by deep dish pizza standards...but by pizza standards.  The crust is buttery, but after that it falls apart. It is not filled enough with toppings and cheese. It is a chinsy deep dish pizza.  Most medium deep dishes are about 8lbs, sometimes more. This is like 4. They need to add more to it and make it a more substantial pie.  I was disgusted. I threw mine over the balcony and screamed down from the bar \"Al Capone should have killed all you sewer rats.\" Strangely they got upset by this. I am not sure I am allowed back.  I am not sure I care.\n\nRex Marvin leads. You follow."

We have been regulars since we moved to Vegas last year but in the last few months they have gotten new managers that have not only changed the menu but gotten rid of the happy hour in the dining area. Which is a bummer if you ask me because if you have littles or you simply hate being hot-boxed in cigarette smoke you obviously can't nor do you want to sit in the bar. They've also gotten rid of the sweet potato fries which is an absolute sin in my opinion. Haha I know that sounds a little dramatic but they were amazing!! I'm hoping this review secretly brings them back:)\nOther than that this place is pretty awesome! Service is great! Food is delish- not your typical bar food. I highly recommend the black and blue sliders. They're out of this world. And of course, the house brewed beers are awesome!! And super cheap. \nBring back my sweet potato fries and happy hour and we'll move back in:)"

Chicago's has a large menu so take your time when choosing. \n\nThe buffalo wings are amazing with a slight vinegar twang and not too hot. The deep dish pizza is completely customizable, I recommend layering your pizza CHEESE FIRST, sauce, pepperoni, extra cheese, and extra sauce. Pot roast, when it is available, is probably the closest to homemade you can get. Lastly, I recommend the in-house brewed root beer: it has a sweet, vanilla, molasses taste. Simply awesomeness.\n\nChicago's is open 24/7 and the menu differs constantly so make sure you familiarize yourself. BUT the wings are available all the time, FTW.\n\nThe service is always friendly, knowledgeable about their brews, and (forgive me for saying) very easy on the eyes.\n\nThe beer review section: I suggest everyone to try the sampler then pick their favorite. The Old Town Ale and Hawaiian Honey are personal favorites. All the beers a distinctly different taste. I do usually prefer a dark ale (Guinness drinker) but Hawaiian Honey is the first light ale I've enjoyed in the at least 7 years.\n\nI will definitely suggest this to EVERYONE that visits Las Vegas. A little trip off of the strip will definitely do you good."

I sampled the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie brew... meh... not my thing. I split the wild game sliders with Norm and Tony (6 for $30) and my favorites were the rabbit, wild boar and bison. Honestly, I can't even remember what the others (alligator, antelope, rabbit/antelope mix) tasted like. It was a week ago, afterall.  If you're a fan of sliders, check it out since they're some of the more unique ones you'll find in the area."

I will have to make more notes as I eat here again to round out my review, but for now, I am just reviewing tonight's meal.\n\nCheese steak: not so great. Not bad as a roast-beef sandwich, I guess, but not what I am looking for in a cheese steak. The meat is thinly sliced, but chewy. Shouldn't have mushrooms (in my opinion, but I wanted to try their version in the format it was offered). And the beer-cheese was okay, but not really what you want in a cheese-steak sandwich. Pass.\n\nBurger: hubby says good.\n\nOnion rings: at least they get the onions cooked all the way through, but the batter feels heavy with grease. Pass.\n\nMacaroni salad: Not the worst I've had. I little too sweet, and it does have that metallic tang that so many mac salads have, although it is faint. I don't know why that flavor is there, but it's not good. Pass."

Kinda tasted like that stuff you get in a glass jar ( tostitos ? ) from the grocery store. \n\nI ordered a steak sandwich with onion rings.  I think i got 5 onion rings ... not worth the upcharge , the steak sandwich was good however , it was literally a whole steak thrown on a peice of bread .....  Anytime i have ever had a steak sandwhich before .. they usually slice it at least.   \n\nMy wife ordered a ruben ... the waitress brought out my sandwhich and basically told us my wife would have to wait for hers since another waitress took her food on accident . ...  dont they put tickets next to the food for this exact reason ?  It took nearly another 15 minutes. By the time she got her food , mine was almost cold as i didnt want to eat and make my wife sit there while i was eating. \n\nWe did get an apology out of the waitress , but thats it.   I dont think i expect free food or discounts for everything , but there are certain things that you would want to take care of your customers with , and this was it. \n\nIm sorry but first impression like this is hard to break .. will not be back."

It was a Monday a few months ago, the place was pretty empty as it was a little after what would have probably been the lunch rush time and it was on a weekday.  But that didn't stop the server from making it a wonderful visit. I wish I could remember her name to give her props, but needless to say, we were happily impressed with her service along with the food.\n\nServer was knowledgeable about majority of the items. There was a question I had she wasn't sure about, but she answered honestly that she wasn't, went to the kitchen to find the correct answer and returned promptly. I'd rather have a server treat me with honesty than lie to hide the fact that they didn't know the right answer. Also proved that she had good relation with the BOH team and encouraged our guest perception that the whole establishment was working well together.\n\nThe beer was as it should be - cold, delicious and served in clean glassware (seems simple, right? but we all know that's not the case).\n\nFood was perfectly done and served hot and fresh.\n\nMy toddler was - as always - a little pain, but our server coddled him flirting with her and paid extra attention. As a veterans of the food service industry, my husband and I were impressed at the attention given to us and the overall quality of the entire visit.\n\nHighly recommend to families and to anyone who wants a great dining experience.\n\nThanks, Chicago!"

There, the service is excellent.\n\nBut the last couple of time I went, me & my guy sat in the bar. We went in the middle of the week & usually around 12 or 1 for lunch. I understand that the servers that wait in the bar area also have tables in the dining room area but they need to manage their tables better.\n\nOur server was nice enough, a bit awkward & standoffish. He took our drink order & my guy wanted to sample a couple of their house beers which the server brought quickly enough. Then he went into the dining room & didn't reappear for a while. My guy had decided which beer he wanted to order but our server was nowhere to be found. No biggie, we waited & another server ended up asking us if we needed something. After we placed our order & my guy got his beer, the wait wasn't long for our food to come out. And boy was it amazing!\n\nI've had their baked ziti with chicken (which I adore) & their pizza & both have been excellent but for lunch I love getting sandwiches from bars. So I ordered their hot pastrami sandwich (for the second time) & bf got their \"black & blue sliders\" & instead of regular fries, upgraded to their smokehouse fries. (Note: I may be wrong about the name of the fries. Basically it's steak fries with melted cheese, bacon, chives, creme fresh, & other stuff I think) \n\nThe pastrami sandwich is awesome! It's served on marble rye bread (my favorite rye) that is crispy & crunchy & not at all soggy, the pastrami is perfect, and it comes with melted Swiss cheese & cole slaw (on the sandwich). The combination of the hot pastrami & the cool crispy cole slaw is divine. It's exactly the way a sandwich should be made. My hats are off to the cooks. My side was their regular fries which are pretty lackluster & bland. But I never care about the fries. \n\nBf said the black & blue sliders were good (who can go wrong with steak & bleu cheese?) but that the \"smokehouse fries\" were not very good. I had a bite & they were alright but very sweet. \n\nThe problem was what happened after we got our food. The server asked us if we needed anything else & we said no....and then he didn't come to our table again until we made it obvious we needed him. He came in a couple of times but never came up to us. Once even when we were done with our food and clearly just sitting there. Finally he came in, took an order at the table next to us, went on our other side & asked if that table wanted more beer, and eventually landed at our table. We asked him for a box & the check & when he came back, I just handed him my debit card without even looking at the check. And I NEVER do that. But I was afraid we'd never see him again. He came back fairly quickly & gave me my receipt. While this was going on, another couple had come in & sat at a table & no one had come up to them at all in 5 minutes. No acknowledgement, no menus, nada. They got mad & left. I could see the woman telling the hostess & being pretty upset about it & frankly, I don't blame her. I would have done the same thing. Our server could at least acknowledged her. He saw that they had left & after the woman stopped talking to the hostess & walked out, that's when he walked out to the host stand to inquire about it. Nice. \n\nBottom line: if you want to eat in the bar area, prepare to wait. If it wasn't for their awesome food, I'd never go back again. But sometimes you have to put up with sub-par service if you want a great meal."

So far I have had both the pozole soup/pizza combo and the fish and chips (each lunch special was $10). The soup was very good, pizza was cooked well, and the fish and chips were spot on but the portion size left a bit to be desired. The craft beers here are extraordinary. You'd be hard pressed to find one you didn't enjoy! From pale ales to IPAs to blonde ales, they typically have the perfect beverage for any pallet. Boasting upstairs and downstairs bar areas to enjoy these custom brews in addition to a cigar smoking area with cigars readily available for purchase, makes Chicago Brewing Company one of the coolest spots to hit for a night out away from the strip."

Other than being super cute and taking our order, then later bringing our check, didn't see much of our server as other staff brought out our food and we were not asked how we liked it until it was nearly gone. Initially intended to ask for ketchup but never saw anyone to ask. Seemed like we may have been a bit forgotten on the back patio.\n\nOrdered the lunch special of a ham and cheese melt with a cup of the soup of the day- cream of mushroom. Sandwich was a good value with tons of ham- a bit salty for my liking but like I said, good value. Soup was very tasty and smooth, with good flavor. Added a side of onion rings, which was about ten rings for $3- perfectly crisp in beer batter, did not fall apart while eating.\n\nMy guy had the 10 piece hot wings with a cup of chili- wings were not hot but had good flavor and were a large size, priced well at $10 for the order coming out to a dollar a wing. Would come back for these wings despite lack of heat, wish they offered more sauces. Chili was also good quality- meaty with a few kidney beans, topped with green onions and cheese. Beer used in cooking was clearly eviden in the flavor of the dish itself.\n\nMy office occasionally has happy hour meetups here, and after experiencing the food I'll have to attend next time. Highly recommend the soups to order, and patio seating for dining and enjoying the weather."

My brother and friend liked the beer selection, I didn't really pay attention as I'm not a huge beer drinker.

My friend ordered wings which were DELICIOUS, but I had the chili fries - they came with tons of cheese as well as this creamy beer cheese, which was all right but it was just way too much cheese.

We sat upstairs which is cozy and presents a dark, comfortable atmosphere where the bartender also serves the tables.\n\nAt first, the bartender was quite attentive until a group of friends arrived to visit him.  Suddenly it was as if we did not exist. The service became so poor I am tempted to never go back. \n\nIn my opinion, this organization gets zero stars for service. The two stars that I have presented are strictly because the happy hour food was decent. Not great, but decent for the price."

Chicago's 24/7 is perfect for after-work drinks! \n\nAs far as food goes, you can't go wrong with: Philly cheesesteak, spinach artichoke dip, buffalo wings, fries, garlic knots, sweet potato fries. I have yet to try more, but I'd be willing to bet money that everything is good."

There is a bar when you first enter so you get a whiff of cigarette smoke, but it's not too bad.  Just noticeable.  The Hostess was nice.  We were seated and as our group grew, they were very accommodating bringing an additional table and chairs without any indications of hardship.  It was like you were family.  Alex was our Rock Star Waitress.  Funny, outgoing, fun, gracious and kind.  Beers came out cold, Alex was seamlessly attentive.  Never made us feel like she was trying too hard; know what I mean?  Anyway, we never felt like we waited too long for anything and she and her team managed our big group with the smoothness of a well tuned and oiled machine.\n\nWe did not order appetizers and got right down to business.  There were a lot of salads consumed tonight.  Go figure, eating with a group of cyclists.  I had the Ahi Tuna Salad.  It was big and I was full when I finished.   It was comprised of about 6 ounces of seared Ahi on top of a bed of baby greens, daikon sprouts, crushed cashews, colorful yellow and red pear tomatoes.  It was supposed to have a wasabi plum dressing, but what I got was more teriyaki based.  It was okay.  A little salty.  They poured the dressing for me.  Gratefully it was not a heavy pour. \n\nNo one complained, plates were cleaned, and they brought out two desserts for the birthday boy...to share.  Deep Fried cheesecake and a chocolate lava cake.  They were both delicious. \n\nI wasn't blown away, but I'd come back to try some of the other items on the menu.  \n\nIt's clean and Alex was the Bomb."

Honestly, being a non-smoker, the air in the bar was fine.\n\nThis is an eatery that brews beer, and brew master David Pascual has won numerous awards (well, the beers have) . There's a great assortment, I tried the IPA and the creamy Black Star Stout. The IPA is on the lighter side, a tad hoppy, not too bitter and not over whelming. They offer short mugs, 22oz mugs, the 50oz Brewtus, Pitchers, Growlers and the Brewzooka's (oh my).\n\nYou're my boy Blue!\nWell, maybe not.\n\nI ordered the Black & Blue Sliders. A compact set of three each equipped with a black angus patty dusted with cajun spice, loaded with caramelized onions and a microcosm of blue cheese crumbles.\n\nThe caramelized onions were delicious, but extremely over powering. I looked, searched, opened and anticipated a burst of blue cheese, but sadly found just a smidgen, a dot, barely a hint of that penicillin-added mold culture we know as blue cheese.  \n\nJust rename the thing the Caramelized Onion Slider, don't tease us with Cajun Spices or Blue Cheese...or better yet, offer a side of Blue Cheese- and for goodness sake, spell it BLEU Cheese.\n\nFriendly service, the bar is loaded with video poker, so sitting at the rail is tough. The high back tables in the bar area are comfortable and it's not too loud, bright or over powering with smoke."

All I can say is \"mistake\" we went here with some friends and from the second we pulled into the parking lot I was already leary of it. The location looked a bit tired and run down but everyone was pretty hungry so we tried it. The inside of the restaurant was just as depressing it doesn't really feel like a restaurant inside I can't pinpoint what it felt like but the atmosphere was just not nice. The manager or the guy who was dressed like the manager seemed inattentive to the restaurant and was just walking around but not really doing anything.  Our waitress was great but that's about where the great stops for this place.  One of the people in our party got pretty sick the next day. We were all pretty thankful we didn't eat the same thing they had. Needless to say we will never go back to this place and I will never ignore my gut feeling."

Both were fine but underseasoned. Each was served with a sizable side of fries, which neither of us finished.\n\nThe rest of the menu seemed like typical bar fare -- burgers, pizza, salads, sandwiches -- but I think I'll stick with the beer next time.

The beer cheese just really didn't work. It just drowned a good portion of the cheese, minus all the fat that goes along with the cheese. You might as well pour oil into some beer and dip it in that. Thats essentially what you're getting.\n\n@ Calamari - This was one of the saving grace of the night. Very delicious and crispy. The scores would be a lot different if this was the only dish I was rating, but it isn't.\n\n@ Filet Mignon Sliders - Absolutely disastrous. I asked for medium rare, one of the 3 sliders was overcooked. The taste department was so dry, flavorless, and uninspired. The onions and mushrooms did nothing for this dish. I had to add barbecue sauce to a filet to make it not suck! When you have to do that, that just tells you how bad this dish is. The bread looks like it just came from a 20-pack at Costco . Not even warmed up or anything special done to it. Slider Truck is where its at for sliders. \n\n@ Olive Deep Dish Pizza - This just wasn't that good. Deep dish is suppose to be packed full of flavors. This was like eating bread dipped in ketchup and olives, flavorless and boring. \n\n@ BBQ Chicken Pizza - Some redemption. This did carry some good flavors and was good. I've had better BBQ Chicken Pizza before, but this  at least saved this place from getting a 1 star. \n\n@ Ghost Chili Tenders - Ghost chills is the hottest peppers in the world, period. I didn't try it because I'm really sensitive to any kind of spicy food. Our group did try it and it wasn't that bad for many. The worst effect is some numbness that lasted 10 minutes. But with a little milk and time, everyone was okay. Not like the oh em gee I can't open my mouth or eyes.\n\nThe reason for coming to this place was solely for our group to try the ghost chili. The menu is dull and uninspiring, its your typical bar food, and not even that good. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly. She was really attentive and personal. Nothing more you can ask from a waitress. However, food did come out kind of slow taking around 35 minutes for our food to come out. \n\nThis place does take Restauraunt.com certificates, which could make a group meal cheaper. Double check to make sure the Happy Hour Deals aren't cheaper.\n\nI wouldn't come here for the food again. If someone wanted to try the ghost chili, this would be the place to go. A great staff can only make bad food go so far."

I could have used more mozzarella and tomato.  Balsamic vinagarett was a reduction, I think.  Whatever it was, it was very good.  I shared it with my dinner mate.\n\nThe BBQ Pizza is amazing.  I like my BBQ sause sweet and the sause fitsthw bill. Everything is fresh and made to order.  The only hint I ammnot understaning is why thy pit corn on it.  I ordered it without the corn as I could not imagine it with corn.  The deep dish crust is amazing.  It is doughy and chewy and tastes great just like I like it.\n\nIm conclusion, it was a great night with great food and great company.  You should have a good time.\n\nPs, they have beer to."

            "review": "This was possibly one of the worst places I've eaten at based on the service and lackluster food. While you can see the wait staff walking around the restaurant constantly, don't expect them to check in too often. Repeatedly through out our meal, my boyfriend had to flag down people that were servicing other tables because our waitress was nonexistent. I wanted to split my meal with my boyfriend and no extra dish was given to do so. We ordered a pasta dish but, it was so bland we didn't finish it. At the end of the meal, due to our party size, we were charged an 18% gratuity. I can't justify 18% gratuity when I saw our waitress once to take our orders and a second time to disperse our meal. We also waited a tremendous amount of time for our meal (45 minutes). After all that waiting, our food was lukewarm/room temperature when it got to the table."

They have already helped provide a catalyst for my alcoholism. \n\nAlso, the bar food is amazing and kitchen is open 24 hours.\n\nIt definitely is a local bar and every time I go in I see the \"usual suspects\" hanging around there, kinda like the Cheers bar :)\n\nStop in and have a drink...or don't, more beer for me."
