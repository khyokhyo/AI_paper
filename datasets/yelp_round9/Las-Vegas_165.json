I got a complimentary bottle only domestic beer: miller light. grazie card.\n\n- nice place to kick it and watch whatever is on espn at the time\n- sucks that all TVs are the same\n- It was practically dead. 2 other  people were there with us. lol. \n- I won at video black jack. You can actually bet up to $100! haha\n- Old Lebron jersey.

            "review": "Good service and comfortable seating.  \n\nThe setup - 5 star.  We made reservations (and I highly recommend doing so) for a Saturday.  I had read the reviews that the place gets a little crazy right before the games so we made the reservation for 30 minutes before kick off.  This gave everyone time to settle in, place their bets, or a round of drinks before kick off.  \n\nThe service - 5 star.  Based on other reviews, I agree that the staff was attentive but not overly.  I disagree that this is a bad thing, however.  If you are passionate about games (which I am), this is a HUGE plus.  It was almost like the staff knew when the commercials where to see if you needed another round.\n\nThe sports book - 4 star. The SB inside the stadium was fully staffed with people who are used to dealing with unfamiliar bettors.  This is either a good thing (if you are not sure what team number you want to bet on) or a bad (if you want the person in front of you to hurry up).  My buddy had never placed a bet before and they were very helpful.\n\nThe food - 2 star.  the only marginal aspect in my opinion.  The nachos (and salsa) were really good but that was it.  I am embarrassed to say we were there for about 8 hours and pretty sure we tried the entire menu without anything other than the nachos being a positive experience.  Highly suggest avoiding the shrimp (eek).\n\nOverall, if you like having personal space, be comfortable, have a couple bucks to spend on food/drink, and want to be able to experience the excitement with others, this is your spot.  If you like it loud, crowded, and traditional, you're probably better served at the Venetian SB (was there the following day and enjoyed it)."

            "review": "This is the place in Vegas to watch games and place your sports bets. I've been here twice, first time over the summer, second time NFL divisional playoffs. If your coming here for a big game(s), like the playoffs, expect it to be booked! (Reservations for Suberbowl have been completely booked for months.) We did not make a reservation so we chanced it and waited 2 hours in the reservation cancellation line. Anyone who does not show up 15 minutes after there reservation loses it, we were 4th in line, luckily we got in about 15 minutes before kickoff. If it is booked and you don't want to wait in the line there is standing room in the bar. Also big game days expect to spend the minimum $50 per person (not to hard to do). Food is okay, wings are awesome. Love the feeling like your watching the game in your own little personal living room."

            "review": "If you're looking to make a sports bet or just watch a game this place is super cool and definitely worth a visit if you're in Vegas. If you're not looking to watch a game or make a sports bet why are you even considering Lagasse's?  This place is made for sports. There's no reason why after visiting your complaint should be that it's \"too sporty\" like some of the other reviews have stated.\n\nWe went this past weekend to put some bets on a basketball game.  When we got to the door a couple of the guys had cigars and were told that there was no smoking allowed inside.  (No smoking in Vegas?!?!  Weird and awesome if you're trying to get away from the cancer cloud that covers this city.) The guy told us that instead we could sit on the patio and offered to escort us there.  He then walked us around and sat us in our own little patio spot with white leather chairs and couches, two flat panel televisions, a pool table and our own private window to the bartender.  It was fantastic! At least there I could lose some major money on a basketball game with class!\n\nI was also able to experience the inside a bit during trips to the restroom and the inside was totally impressive as well.  They had more tv's than I've ever seen in a place with a very cool and chic feel.  Whether you decide to sit outside or inside you're in for a treat for watching the games.\n\nAs for the food, everything I tried was good.  We had chicken wings, soft pretzels (delicious) with cheese dipping sauce and a steak sandwich with french fries. Although it was all very tasty the surprising winner for me was the fries.  They were steak fries with truffle oil and parmesan cheese.  I don't think I've ever had a more flavorful french fry. You want to eat these. I promise.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and you're looking to watch the game at a stylish place with major television real estate and solid food options this is the place for you."

I can understand if it was Super Bowl Sunday, but this was just playoffs, and there was hardly anyone in the place. No wonder why. They're so busy trying to be a nightclub, they chase off all the people who come there for what it really is: a sports bar."

There is no other place I've found that lets you bet, get fucked up, and eat while watching HUGE TV's in a bar setting (that doesn't have slot machines in sight).  \n\nIf you're a man's man, you'll love it.  \n\n**The reason it's not 5 stars is that I found the food to be very underwhelming.  \n\nSuggestion:  Rent a private room if you have 6-10 people.  It's awesome and comes with 3 50\" TV's, pool table, and Ms. Pacman (in case you're $1000 bets aren't doing well and you need something to take your mind off it)."

A girl in one of the entry way of Palazzo was handing out a 25% off card for Lagasse's Stadium, so we said why not. \n\nYou can seat in a conventional booth or in the stadium lounge section, we opt for the latter. Area was spacious. Kind of different and neat, you sit in front of their huge sportsbook tv's. The place was empty, so we had plenty of room to spread out and kick back. \n\nI had the chicken avocado wrap with fries. Decent for lunch, nothing fancy but nothing terrible. Now thinking about it, chicken a little bland and dry. The GF had the BLT with fries. Nice size sandwich with a nice pile of thick-cut bacon. We both liked it. We also both had Bloody Mary's to start our day, something nice and salty before shooting craps. \n\nService was decent. She and the water boy was there when we needed them and then gave us our space. With the discount, it was a modest bill for Vegas. \n\nSo...this place is not awful but nothing great. Just a practical place to have a lunch. Depending on you, 2 or 3 Yelp stars. With the coupon card, you can stop by. Without the discount, you're not missing anything."

We got a seat in the dining area...not the stadium in front of the large tv. We had several smaller TVs around us.  The dining area required a $50 tab per person (vs the $100 per person in the stadium).  We started with breakfast that was tasty and continued throughout the morning/afternoon with drinks and chicken wings.  All very good but not amazing.  It's more about the environment than the food here."

We didn't have a reservation, but there was an open lounge that we both fit on, so we were able to sit in the stadium area. It was the perfect way to end a weekend in Vegas -- feet up, big screen TV, and beers delivered at regular intervals. A coupla minuses - there are no speakers around the room, so you don't get any sound in stereo; I\"m nost sure how they pick the game that's on the big screen. It seemed like there were a lot of Charger fans there, but they were showing the Dallas game. The staff is very friendly too."

Luckily I saw a flier on the strip saying that Lagasse's Stadium was going to have a viewing party that night. Me and a buddy of mine jumped on the opportunity expecting an average sports bar inside.\n\nOnce we were in the stadium, I must have died and gone to sports heaven. This was easily the nicest, most decadent bar I've ever been to. They have black jack tables that are surrounded by LCD TVs, luxury boxes with its own amenities, multiple bars, additional LCD's at every corner, and to top it off an enormous tv screen that should be in a movie theater.  As for booze prices, they were average for Vegas so no surprise there. Sadly we got there much too late to grab one of those sweet looking leather seats, but there was enough room to just hang out at one of the bars.\n\nWhile UFC 123 didn't pan out like I wanted it to (Machida was robbed!!!) I had a terrific time here. I definitely have to try out the whole experience the next time I go here."

I didn't sit there because I was there to watch a hockey game (Coyotes at Red Wings) and they said that they were going to put the Celtics game on the big screen. Instead, I sat at a table and had my own TV that they put the game on. Lots of the 4-top tables in the dining area have their own TVs and they're happy to put on your game. They ran the audio for my game almost the whole way thru, eventually changing over to the Celtics game.\n\nFood: I had a french dip sandwich which was killer (with great fries), and their hot wings which were meh. \n\nDrinks: I drank Stellas, and my buddy had a martini, which he said was good (not great).\n\nService: my first waiter was rather inattentive, and when they brought my french dip, I asked the food runner to bring me mayo for my fries, which didn't appear til too late. I got a new waitress part way thru my visit and she was much better. \n\nThe only reason I'm yanking one star is because it was friggin freezing in there. Cold like a meat locker. \n\nThis place kicked ass. I WILL be back here (when I'm back in Vegas)\n\nEdit on 23Apr: I ordered wings from Pizza Hut (of all places) and they were a billion times better than the wings here."

Not a prime location but it was just me so.. no problem. When I sat down I imediately paid for dinner and a beer because my waitress was taking off.\nThe food was good but not great. I had the Shrimp Po'boy.  The shrimp was really good. in quality and ample. The bread was cut so the shrimp had a tough time staying in the sandwich. The fries were good too.  It all could have used the tabasco I asked for. I asked for tabasco 2 times and never got any.\nI understand there is a minimum of $50 a person here.  This is where it gets sticky. Don't try to stay here too long.. About the time I was settling in I was told another  minimum would be required.  Since I wasn't sure how much longer I would stay..1/2 hour to an hour at most and there was no way to comprimise on this new minimum.  I left.  The place was half empty and they could have used the sales.  I left half a plate of nachos just to avoid further embarrassment.  I have never been treated this rudely anywhere. I like other sports bars (ESPN, Fox Sports Grills, locals) and should have found one.\nI should  have simply found another restaurant to eat at and watched ESPN in my room or another bar. I WILL NEVER GO BACK.\nNothing special here.  The food is adequate, the service ok, the management questionable."

Located in the Palaazo where I recently stayed, I really wanted to try Emeril Lagasse's food, so opted for the Lagasse Stadium.  The best way to describe this  place is it's an upscale sports restaurant with big screen TVs and comfy lounge chairs set up stadium style in the TV viewing area. Every sports channel imaginable was on (Rio Olympics) and the vibe was really upbeat and fun. \n\nNow for the food: I ordered an oyster po boy and it was the best I've ever had. The oysters were seasoned very well, had a crisp batter and were large. They were set on a fresh roll with some type of mayo sauce. I literally could have ordered another it was so good. Instead of fries. I opted for a salad which was fresh and good. \n\nOur waitress was bubbly and friendly. But one issue: my silverware was NOT clean. Staff should pay more attention to wrapping up dirty silverware in a dinner cloth. It appeared it was washed in a dishwasher but there was food that didn't come off completely.

This is a money making MACHINE. Every seat, even the cheap seats at a skinny casual counter with non comfy stools designate a $50 per person minimum. Take a table with cushy chairs or couch and you're ordered to spend much higher. IMO, Palazzo needs a regular sportsbook with more flexible viewing options. A) football is NOT the only sport in the country in late October and B) I should be able to simply order a glass of wine while watching the sport of my choice.

The view of the huge screen and the comfort of their couches were amazing. I felt like I was in the comfort of my home and I could even put my feet on the furniture! The service was also great. He was always there when we needed him but didn't interrupt the event. \n\nNow to the semi-downside. You have to reserve a couch seat for major events. This night it was $100 minimum in purchases per person. If you are not a big drinker it is hard to get to those minimums. The food overall was so-so. The wings were the best thing we had, and I would stay away from the pretzel with the really watery cheese sauce.

Stadium style seating for one of the biggest hd tv projector you can ever find in a sports bar and smaller lcd tv's at about every wall you can look at.  When you get a seat (which is very hard to find because it gets crowded on a good day) you can also request to have the channel change to teams or sports you'd like to watch.\n\nServers are everywhere.  I've never had a problem here as others have complained on their reviews.  I've always been attended to but the prices here are pretty steep for a sports bar.  In order to be seated, food must be ordered though which I agree with because seating is limited and should only be given to those that are gonna eat.  And to be seated for the stadium style area, there's a minimum to how much you must and spend and reservations are highly recommended.\n\nGreat place but I have to give it a 3 star unfortunately because as nice as this place is, it doesn't give that over all experience of what a true sports bar should feel like.  Guys you know what I mean.  I'd rather watch big games at my local pubs where it people are more of true fans, talking sh*t along with the bartenders, cigarette butts in the urinal, not having to pay ridiculously high prices just to drink and eat to simply watch you team play.  I'd sacrifice the biggest tv and rather be in a smaller venue where I can enjoy the game and have a good time with the bottom dwellers and true fans.  Lagasse is too higher up for me and the people there don't feel like true sport fans at all."

Bar tender was great. We got our table 45 minutes after kickoff after a heated exchange with the manager who gave several excuses that simply were not true. We only got our table after challenging her on every excuse. Simple answer was that people were sitting at tables that they did not have reservations for and these guys apparently had no way to monitor this. Waitress was great, the physical facility is outstanding for watching a game, food was very good but reservation desk is poorly managed. This is the second bad experience I have had here and all were customer service related. Last time I had a problem here we were seated and never had a waitress show up. I went to the bar which was close by and told them we had been there 15 minutes and still had no server. He told me that it was not his problem. We left and I stopped at the door to tell the manager about our lack of service and bad attitude from the bar tender and just got a blank look.

They sort of stuck down in the basement, away from everything else.  It typically costs at least $100 just to sit down (even at the bar chairs). Perhaps the most egregious thing is that when there are major sporting events (Superbowl, NCAA tourney) the confined space winds up smelling like a locker room or worse.  \n\nBecause the bathrooms are located in the main room and have no doors, the stench wafts into the main room and basically stays trapped in this sealed chamber of stink they call a stadium. And it gets worse and worse as the game goes on.  Imagine hundreds of people, drinking beer, eating wings and chili fries taking dumps right next to you as you watch the World Series.  (Because that's exactly what it smells like -- that or if like 30 women all got perms and then whizzed on the floor.)  It's not like the bathrooms are down a long hallway or around the corner or anything --- they're right there in the main space, with no doors, with the stench of sweet potato fries diarhea constantly flowing into the main room. Bam! \n\nIf it didn't have the funk of doo-doo in there, it would actually be a good place to watch games because of the stadium seating (almost like futons) and the TV set up.  The $100 per person minimum is insulting though, especially when you've bet much more on the game itself. Remember the days when you'd get a comfy chair and free drinks in a sports book?  Those days are over.  At least at this one.\n\nP.S. You'll be tempted to walk over to the sports book at the Venetian.  It's pretty horrible also.  It's almost entirely geared towards the ponies and those horse race regulars take up all the seats -- which are in rows behind these red \"Wall of China-like\" lacquered separators. (The noodle shop next door only helps this comparison.) There are also these extremely bright spot lights that blind you. Do not look up and consider wearing sunscreen. It's really a horrible, uncomfortable sports book with zero class and even less taste. Imagine if Target opened a sports book.  This is what it would look like. And one of the big screen TVs (one of two) wasn't even showing the fight in HD!\n\nIf you're resigned to stay at the Palazzo, go to the Two Pianos bar on the Casino level.  They show most games and usually there's no minimum to watch the games. Just get yourself a few drinks.  People smoke a lot in there but in my opinion, smoke is better than doo-doo."

To be honest, I was very hesitant. I had not read good things...and at first glance, the place seems almost sterile. But, that all changed when we met our waitress, Armine. This sweetheart made our night...and probably will go down as one of the highlights of our trip. She was spunky, funny, smart, and honest. We adored her. The food was some of the best we have had this trip, and this is after many \"so-called 4& 5-star rated\" places that we found to be less than 1(star)\nI had the tuna poke appetizer, which was incredible. Light, perfectly balanced flavors, not fishy at all. I also tried the Bread and Butter Bourbon Pudding, and while I missed having things like raisins in it, I actually liked trying a new rendition.\nOthers in my party had the wings (which they loved), and one ordered a salmon with lentils dish that was brand new to the menu (per Armine's suggestion). He loved it....and he is not an easy one to please.\nAll in all.....the food was great, but we all agreed that the service was what made the experience one we'd want to repeat. We will come back during football season for sure, and demand this adorable gal to be our waitress! :-)"

I just wanted to have some happy hour drinks and bet on some horse to start the day. TV's showing horses were not near the bar. \n\nThe bartender was a toolbox. We ordered our well drinks, a bloody mary and a screwdriver and he tried to charge me $19. I inquired if it was happy hour and he was like \"oh...umm yeah, hold on\". Seriously? I'm sure you knew it was happy hour. Then he comes back and says that only the screwdriver would be included in happy hour as a bloody mary wasn't a well drink. Really?....\n\nThen I sat there and drank my weak drink. Masses of idiots swarmed in for reserved seating for some stupid soccer match. Soccer sucks and so did they. \n\nI never really felt like I was supposed to sit anywhere in here. They acted like I shouldn't be at their bar. Their are some tramps at the door but they dont seat you, they just say hi. Its all pretty confusing. Why bother with the tramps? What service do they provide? Do I seat myself or not? What the hell? Sounds like the food is terrible too. \n\nI think I'll just go to the regular sports book at Harrahs and drink free drinks and sit wherever the hell I want next time. \n\nApparently its just too \"cool\" for me here...."

I purchased the Groupon deal before I left home in anticipation of trying Lagasse's Stadium, the waiter was really cool about it and explained that it was happy hour so I could either use the Groupon or take advantage of Happy Hour specials.  I opted to do the Groupon since I wouldn't have a chance to visit again before it expired.  \n\nThe place is super comfy, I loved sitting on a comfy couch, watching a huge tv with baseball (love baseball so that was heaven) and having a fun, nice waiter bring me beers and nachos.  I was there with 2 of my best friends, so us 3 females had a great time watching the good looking around us as well.  \n\nThe Red Sox vs. Yankees game was on the giant screen and it was super entertaining to watch all the rivalry going on in the bar.

It has a theatre-like section with couch seating and they serve entrees and bar food.\n\nI sat at the bar had the wings and then the crab cakes - I was hungry. Both were good but as other reviewers have mentioned, not outstanding. I chatted with people at the bar and asked how their food was. Same reaction. \n\nService and staff were good. For a place in the Palazzo complex I had high expectations. Bottom line: As a sports bar probably 4 stars, as a bar food place 3 stars and as an Emeril food place, only 2 stars."

While not pleased at the $50 per person minimum  during Monday Night Football, my friend was jazzed to go here and watch the game, so we opted for dinner in spite of the so-so reviews. The service was fine as the place wasn't packed, but it all went to hell in a handbasket when the entree arrived. In this case, the chicken basket. The outside of \"Emerils Fried Chicken\" was overcooked and the crust was much darker in spots than others, a sign of bad things to come. I cut into the piece and it was raw. I have never sent something back before, but bacterial food poisoning didn't sound too hot before thanksgiving - so back it went. \n\nThe manager apologized and I opted for the Chinese chicken salad which was so drenched in garbage, it had to be eaten with a spoon, and the chicken was pathetically overcooked. This dining experience is embarrassing to the Legasse brand, after eating stellar meals at Table 10 and Delmonico's in the past. I advise to avoid this place. If the food matched the ambience, it would be such a great place to catch a game. I recommend you stick to nothing but finger foods and beverages during your visit, if you feel like you have to come here."

A great, great place to watch games when you are in town and have some money in the line! \n\nHow it works: \nPay per person for a seat. The payment becomes a credit for your dining. Obv there are different pricing ranges, about 25-100 per person. Stadium seating is $100 per person per game during football season. \n\nTip: DEFINITELY book months ahead of time if you're coming here for a big sports weekend- NFL's opening Sunday only had two seats left when we asked about it during July 4 weekend. \n\nSeating is kinda strange as so many of the seats will give ya a massive crick in the neck. Some seats the tv is mounted in front of your table, and the cheaper ones are mounted sideways so that everyone has to turn their heads while watching a game. \n\nFood is kinda generic. Better than average, but still kinda average. \n\n- Sweet potato fries- a huge portion to share. Not too sweet at all without sauce and delicious!\n- Shrimp cocktail- my buddy ate them all and enjoyed it a lot. Maybe like 6 shrimp or so?\n- pretzel- generic and served with nacho cheese sauce and a tasty mustard\n- Shakes- served with two cookies. They give ya the tiniest straws to sip it through, and it ends up being closer to liquid because of it. \n- Caesar salad- kinda generic. \n-Wings- generic\n\nStill a cool place to watch a game if you like throwin' down some eats while watching a game. Plus stars for the place itself and a \"push\" on stars for overall food."

We ordered drinks and realized there was an area of regular dining tables we asked to be reseated in that area. We found our own way there, sat down at a table only to discover the carpet appeared not to have been vacuumed from the day before (we arrived just before noon). Apparently our drinks were to be sent to the new table (drinks in plastic cups!). We waited another ten minutes and no one came to check on us or take our order and our drinks still never arrived. ( All the while there were plenty of empty tables and few patrons in the restaurant so they were far from busy) We did not have a good feeling about the place, wondered how Emeril could think this lives up to his standards (albeit a sports bar.....it there should be a BAM standard!). We left our table, exited through glass doors that were full of fingerprints (obviously not cleaned from the day before). Can't review on the food, but our appetites were gone by the time we left."

HDTV after HDTV throughout the place and a sports book to make your bets.  I would warn you not to try to get a seat on an NFL Sunday or major sporting event as it is booked months in advance.\nThe lounge area is really neat in concept.  \nNow to the reason I ended on 2 starts...the food, the prices, and the service.\nFirst off, the food is sub par at best.  I've had a couple items that were ok on the menu, such as the nachos and the water, but I've had many more which were just poor.\nNext is the cost.  Most items are $5-10 over prices and beers are $7.  Go at a hot time of the week and they may require a minimum $/hour spent.  \nLastly, the service is horrific.  Sitting in the lounge, you can actually watch your waitress stand up by the bar talking to other workers while your drink goes dry or you wait to order.  I have been to Lagasse's about 7 times, but I can only think of one time I have had good service.  The last time I was there in Dec, there were a total of 4 groups of people watching the games, having a few beers and eating, yet we sat waiting to order food and drinks.  When we were done with our meal, we had to wait 20 minutes for the waitress to clear our plates.\nFor some stupid reason I keep going back. It is like a bad monument.  You go once time to see the place and you over look bad because the bar/monument is so cool...however after you have gone several times, you start to see the core to the business and it becomes apparent that they bar is just not good.\nI won't fault you for going one time, but if you go a second time and it is as bad as the first, don't say I didn't warn you."

There is an outside patio area with outdoor seating and TVs so you never miss a second of the game.  Although there's only a short wall that separates you from the people walking on the strip, having an outdoor area is refreshing and the view of TI offers a nice change of scenery.\n\nInside the luxury box, there are multiple big screen TVs (which you can set to different channels so you never miss a game), several couches, a private bathroom, an old-school Ms. Pac-Man arcade game you can play for free, and a pool table.  The room is spacious and appropriately adorned in sports memorabilia.  The room we always get can easily accommodate 30 people.\n\nThe environment sets it self up to be a trendy spot to watch games.  The food however, falls flat.  I know it's just bar food, but when you have a big name like Emeril behind it, you imagine some kind of revolutionized, re-imagined, delicious interpretation of bar food.  The food is just average.  They do have a cheesy beer & giant pretzel that is all sorts of buttery fatty goodness.  But that's about it.  And I was told the dough for the pretzel is imported from Germany.  I have yet to actually confirm that.\n\nAn interesting tid bit is that one of their chefs, Chef Scott, competed on the Food Network's Chopped and won.  So that's pretty awesome.  I got the opportunity to meet him and he was very friendly and approachable.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't go to Lagasse's unless my friends and I had a luxury box and we were watching a special game.  I wouldn't order food there again either unless I was really hungry or really drunk.  I go to Lagasse's for the environment, company, and experience."

The waiter was alright but he spent most his time sitting and chatting with the other couple so I can't really judge the atmosphere here but service didn't wow me with the exception of the bus boy. I don't know who it'd be on a busy day"

Not what I expected at all from one of Emeril's restaurants!! I had the French dip sandwich, which basically tasted like something you'd get at TGI Fridays... and to make it worse, the au jus was bland and tasteless! My wife got a burger so greasy that the bun fell apart halfway through. THE ONLY saving grace was the grilled asparagus... seasoned well. \nOur waitress was slow and forgetful, and only seemed to start to pay more attention to us when it was time to pay the check...\n\nThe setup was pretty cool, especially in the center of the restaurant with the stadium seating (i can only imagine how much they charge for those tables) and the HUGE tv setup.... But correct me if I'm wrong... A Legasse restaurant should be about the food first....\n\nOverall... I would suggest spending your money at other notable vegas restaurants!"

The seating system is HEAVILY flawed, there is no reason that a Vegas establishment has not figured out an efficient manner in which to service guests. The servers were all passive aggressively hostile as well. They have a $50 minimum per customer and treat you like you like they could care less whether you are satisfied or not.

The meal I had at Lagasse's Stadium was by far the worst meal I had all week!!  That is pretty bad, considering I was forced to eat fast food italian at the Venetian food court on one of the days!  I ordered the Pesto & Cheese pizza with \"oven roasted\" tomatoes.  This was the worst pizza I have had in a long time!  Basically a decent crust topped with a tasteless pesto sauce, about 8 pounds of mediocre cheese, and a few lumps of dried out, burned tomatoes.  Terrible!  One friend had the BLT, she said it was decent but not the best she has had.  Our other friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich - all she could taste was the mayo-type dressing from the huge pile of slaw that sat atop the pork.  This is definitely not what I expected from a restaurant with Lagasse's name on it!  I would not return and would not recommend this place to anyone.  The one plus - they were showing the Women's World Cup soccer games and one of my friends was happy to watch that."

Huge screens, giant plush couches, pool tables and tv's everywhere. But the high minimums and pretty average bar food kill the potential.\n\nI've been here a few times and the restaurant itself is very impressive. There actually is stadium style seating as you face the giant screens lining the walls. Interestingly, the Lagrasse's Stadium double as the Palazzo's sports book so you can place bets here as well. In the back they have massive party rooms, complete with big screen tv's pool tables. and arcade games but I am sure they would charge you an arm and a leg for reserving them.\n\nNow the downside: Lagrasse's Stadium is simply just overpriced. On most nights, seating in the stadium area carries a $25 minimum per person. Bigger events like Superbowl run around $150+ per person. Considering that a burger and fries is about $30 hitting these requirements is not hard nor really worth it. The food is pretty average, the stadium burger is pretty much what you would find upstairs at Grand Lux but for double the price. The pizzas are standard, spinach dip was thin an watery but their buffalo wings are delicious!\n\nIn the end you are really just paying for the experience, and there is nothing else like it on the Strip. Check it out but don't expect the food to match the surroundings."

It's as advertised for a perfect game day atmosphere. My only complaint is I kind of got the shaft after walking around and seeing all the setups. My couch and table was at the very back, which left me limited to just one screen.  And that screen was angled opposite of the couch, so the whole watching experience was quite uncomfortable. Plus, the couch backed up to the bar so kind of felt like I was in the kitchen the whole time.  \n\nThe food is solid.  We had nachos with chicken, crab cake, meatloaf sandwich, and chicken and waffles.  I would rank nachos number one and chicken and waffles last.\n\nFinally, our game was changed from the TV dedicated to our table before it ended. Not sure if that's by design, but definitely felt like we were getting the boot to make way for the next customers.  Bad form in my opinion."

Way better than your smoky Vegas sports book. We just had drinks, so no comments on food, but some of it looked good, in a traditional sort of way. \n\nAll the seating is couch style, all pretty comfy. Being here for an NCAA tournament would be pretty awesome, but I'm guessing it's tricky to get in the door.

I'm normally not this nice. \n\nLagasse's Stadium was our first stop when we got to Vegas. Not intentionally, but we checked into the hotel, realized the Texans preseason game was on and figured we could find a place that we could watch the game and grab a bite before our first night exploring the Strip. Bitches need nourishment, yo!\n\nSo thanks to the magic of Yelp, we found Lagasse's Stadium and it seemed to be the perfect fit. We headed in expecting it to be pretty croweded (football is starting, yall! WTF?) and it was pretty dead. After reading some of the other reviews, that's probably why we didn't encounter any seating issues or table minimum situations. As a matter of fact, they sat us smack dab in the middle of the big ass couch/screen area. \n\nThe first words out of my mouth were, \"Holy shiznit, I would DIE to come here on a Sunday during regular season.\" I play fantasy football and this place is a FF player's dream - seriously. One big screen with the main game and I think maybe about 8 others right next to it. Cue the choir of angels. \n\nSo we were STARVING at this point, so we decided to go ahead and get an appetizer, see how hungry we were and then decided whether to share an entree or get two separate ones. We decided on the BBQ Pork Nachos and ordered a couple of (overpriced) beers.\n\nIn all honesty, I was expecting a tiny plate of like 8 nachos, individually dressed or something like that for $14. Seemed about par for the course in Vegas. Uhhhh no dice. This plate of nachos was freaking ENORMOUS. Literally a mountain of melted cheese, onions, jalapenos, sour cream, guacamole, super yummy BBQ pulled pork and other deliciousness I was too busy shoving in my mouth to notice. \n\nThe best part was that they didn't commit the cardinal sin of nachos - piling all the goodies on top of one mound of chips, which means once you get through the top layer, all the good stuff is gone and you're chomping on dry chips. No bueno. But no...halfway through, I peel off a deliciously cheesy chip to find another mound of cheese meat, sour cream and guac goodness. \n\n*Slow Clap*\n\nNow, I will say these are probably the most expensive nachos I've ever paid for...but then again I'm from Texas. In the end, it stuffed both of us for a grand total of $14, so I can't really complain. \n\nI'm a little bummed cause I really wanted to try that French Dip, but I was already slipping into a food coma, and there's no no time for napping in Vegas, duh! Next time, it's going down."

Even though he got there 3 hours before the 10am game time, all of the stadium style seating had already been reserved!  NOTE:  GET THERE EARLY or you will most likely be standing.  Luckily he was able to grab an outdoor section for us.  There are about 8 outdoor sections - each with their own TV (you can pick which game to watch) and a bunch of couches.  Only bad thing is there is only one audio feed to the outside sections, meaning whatever game is being played on the big screen inside (stadium seating section) is what will be played outside. Overall a very fun atmosphere - it was VERY busy.  \nThe food was mediocre.  I tried the wings, a chicken avocado wrap, nachos, and onion rings.  Typical bar food.  In my opinion - I think Emeril forgot the BAM factor here.  The service was SUPER slow but understandably so since it was absolutely packed.  Here's a tip, if you bet on the games, you get complimentary drink tickets.  We didn't pay for one drink there - guess it's their way of saying thank you for losing all of your money in the Sportsbook. lol.  \n\nHowever bad the food/service was, the atmosphere made up for it.

We would've thought the staff in a mega sport's bar would know an IPA was a type of beer. The portion size was average. This was a place on the list of things to do. I would defiantly return during a game in hopes of happy hour specials."

            "review": "SO we found this place maybe 2 or 3 years ago.  We were in town and wanted to watch a UFC fight.  When we looked it up it said it was showing at Lagasses Stadium.  So we headed over.  Totally not what i was expecting.  We sat at the bar and I had noticed that there was a lot of tables that were reserved.  We sat at the bar and had a great time. \n\nThis time around, a month before we headed to Vegas, I made reservations for Saturday and Sunday.  Yes there was 2 ufc fights back to back.  The hostess said it would be $50 min. per person.  To me I thought it was a great deal.  You think the fights can be 3-4 hours long.  \n\nFirst night, we got there a little early but we got seated right away.  Melissa was our server.  She is so sweet and nice.  We started with a wedge salad and the etouffee.  The etouffee was great, a little salty, but you get used to it.  The wedge salad was good, but by the time you get to the bottom it got a litte soggy.  We also ordered the pretzel.  This was so huge.  The 2 dippling sauce it came with was good with the pretzel.\n\nI ordered for the main course the halibut, and it was yummy.  He ordered the bbq pork pulled sandwich.  This was just ok, nothing great about it. \n\nWe ended the banana cream pie.  Oh boy was this yummy.  The bananas were fresh and firm still.\n\nMelissa had a server assistant, who was amazing.  I wish I got his name.  He was super friendly and super quick.  We never needed to ask for more water.  He always made sure if we were half way done with our water, he filled it up.\n\nThe second night Shelley was our server and she was amazing as well.  We started with chicken nachos.  I really wanted this the first night we were there but we got it the second night.  It was just ok.  The cheese sauce was a little different.  We also ordered the stadium salad.  This to, was ok.  Nothing special, I think I would have like the wedge salad better.  I ordered the etouffee again with a side of pictures.  It is so yummy.  \n\nWe ended with a root beer float with warm chocolate chip cookies.  Im not a fan of root beer, but the cookies were really good.  Warm, soft, and moist.  The boyfriend really enjoyed the combination.  \n\nYou really dont feel like your in a sports bar, its not as loud as a normal sports bar and doesnt smell :).\n\nTo note:  I paid with my debit card and I noticed what was on my bank account was not what I signed for.  When I brought it to their attention, the manager checked to make sure that the check got closed our properly.  When he came back to show me, he said that the hotel puts a certain % hold on the card.  It ended closing as the amount I signed (this happened for both nights).  Just an FYI. \n\n\nI will for sure come back when we are in vegas and want to watch a fight, or to have some yummy etouffee.   Ask for Shelley or Melissa."

Instead, when my wife and I arrived at the door, the hostess asked if we were \"lost or just looking around\". Immediately, this was an insult since you have to go downstairs at the Palazzo and the only thing down there is the Stadium. We entered and went to the part for the online advertised \"Tail Gate Party\" which ended up being false. Instead of all the great happy hour specials, it was $3 domestic bottles....who gives a $HIT. Anyways, we are staying at the Palazzo but recommend going to the Sushi place in the same building; the bartender there was awesome, the drinks were great and the food was delicious."

            "review": "Formerly the Palazzo's sportsbook, Lagasse's Stadium opened this week just in time for college football madness. \n\nI'm giving a bit of leniency to this review because despite them being open for only three days, and the fact that they were PACKED from Labor Day weekend + college football openers, both the service and food were pretty much decent.\n\nLet's start with the much vaunted \"Stadium Seating\" which my wife and I reserved for the USC-SJSU game. It's just as comfy as it looks, but then again I only sat there for 30 seconds before the server told us that game would NOT be on the big screen, despite the host telling us otherwise. \n\nWe were moved to a semi-private sky box which is more or less an epic living room, with sofas, tables, and multiple flatscreens. Thankfully the entire room was stuffed with SC fans so it was like a big party. I think the only complaint about the seating is that it's maybe TOO lounge-y. You're pretty much forced to sit way back in the couch and put your feet up. I think having recliner-type seating would have been a better idea. Also, all the couches are white fabric. How they plan on keeping them clean is beyond me.\n\nAlso, this type of seating structure is kind of a logistical nighmare, because there's no set number of seats. If someone's sprawled out on a couch there's not much you can do about it. Anyone looking to sit in these rooms is at the mercy of the occupants' hospitality.\n\nBeer selection is laughable - of the 5 beers on tap, only 2 were not American macrobrew piss (Newcastle and Shock Top) -- and they were out of Shock Top. There's a big selection of bottled brews, but come ON, there's no reason to not have 15-20 draft beers. On the plus side, a pint of Newcastle was only $5 which is a friggin' BARGAIN by Vegas standards.\n\nOh, and get this - beer is NOT OFFERED IN PITCHERS. (I can hear the \"WHA-A-A-T?!\" from here). What makes this even more odd is that they offer their DRINKS in pitcher form. Want a pitcher of margaritas or bloody marys? No problem! Pitcher of suds? No can do, sorry. I'd like tete-a-tete with the manager who thought that was a good idea and see if he is, in fact, mentally retarded.\n\nFinally, the food. This is truly what I'd consider a \"mixed bag.\" I'm not sure if it was from the kitchen being overwhelmed, or another case of a celebrity chef's marketing team stamping his fat face on a franchise without bothering to actually, you know, consult him in regards to the menu.\n\n1) Sausage arancini. These were tasty, if slightly lacking in the sausage department. Also, someone needs to tell the kitchen that \"arancini\" means \"small oranges,\" a descriptor of the suggested size of these fried risotto balls. I'm guessing they ran out of oranges for comparison, these are more like \"testicle-cini.\" Don't expect authentic Italian -- the Sicilian couple next to us weren't too happy about their order. \n\n2) Pizza. This shit sucks. Whether it's the nature of the dish or the kitchen working the kinks out, it's something I won't order again. It arrived with the cheese congealed, the underside mushy, and the crust limp. We sent it back after one bite.\n\n3) Chili cheese fries. Good but not mind-blowing. Also, small portion compared to the huge basket of fries that arrive sans-chili. The chili is decently meaty (purists: contains beans, beware) and ample.\n\nI do wish we had ordered the ribs. They looked and smelled amazing. \n\nOn the whole, the Stadium needs some menu tweaking, but the unique seating arrangement is a great way to watch a game, especially if you're in a room with a bunch of like-minded fans."

Of course in true Vegas fashion to do anything cool we had to spend a minimum of $50 each on food and drink to stay for a 4 hour time slot. They cater to the different times the games play. \nWe all wore our favorite team jerseys as we were having a girls weekend in Vegas and girls flew in from all over. It was a perfect Sunday in Vegas.

Plenty of screens, several different areas for viewing besides the main stadium, and plenty of comfy seating. And for the big ballers they even have luxury boxes. \n\nBut Yelp is all about the food and this place comes through like its name. Its classic Emeril with several items on the menu from his restaurants but he also put traditional bar food items on the menu like nachos, pizza, and buffalo wings. It is the Palazzo not Hooters so don't be surprised with the prices for these items. But like always Emeril's food is on point. We sat at the bar and were a little disappointed because the bar stools were affixed and couldn't sit close to each other. We had the Grilled Beef Rid Eye with horse radish cream and mash potatoes, and the Acadian Caprese salad which came with lightly battered shrimp. \n\nOn a side note what is up with Emeril and his Stinginess with Shrimp. The salad only had two and and the famous BBQ was seriously weak for 15 bones even though its the Palazzo. Please its only shrimp!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nThe rib eye was seasoned and cooked(medium) just right and the salad was very tasty. I will be going back to see his take on traditional bar food, but overall if you don't mind dropping cabbage on a good meal with your lady and good service and atmosphere then you won't be disappointed with Lagasse's Stadium and she won't be either."

Our waitress was super chill and personable.  Enjoyed the wings and the hot pretzel.  Someone else in our server's section got a free bucket of beers (totalling 6) because of some other mishap. He was alone and didn't finish them; two of those beers made their way into our bucket, courtesy of our server! =)  She also moved us down into the couch section later in the night as areas had cleared out.

We were quickly shooed away by an employee and told we should sit elsewhere, as the couches are reserved for 6 person groups.  Okay, fine.\n\nWe go down to the main area and ask where we can be seated.  They tell us we need to check in at the front desk.\n\nOnce we get to the front desk, they tell us that they cannot seat us, as the 10am game is not out yet - we'll have to wait until the 1pm game begins.  Oh, and there's a $50 per person minimum.  We'd have to eat and drink a LOT to make that worthwhile.\n\nThere are a million other places to watch a game.  We made our way over to First around the corner and were greeted by a friendly hostess who showed us to a nice, comfy couch in the bar area to watch the game - no minimum, no hassle.  We got real quality food for way less than $50 per person."

I am one of those girls that loves sports (GO GIANTS) and I often like to quiz \"manly\" men who claim to be big sports fans on their sports trivia. With that being said, this is my kind of bar. It's all stadium seating, hence the name, and they have a ton of comfy, swanky couches. Every booth has it's own tv that you can change on your own. The food is pretty good, and they have surprisignly reasonable prices on drinks. You most definitely have to make reservations for any type of big game. On our last visit we pulled out cards and played drinking games, and they were totally fine with it. ( I would give them an extra star solely for that if I could.)"

We tried to make reservations over the phone before we went out to Vegas but they were so unorganized when it first opened as Lagasse's. Not sure why but we practically got shut out for MNF.  It worked out though. There's really not a bad seat in the house. Well, originally the attendant at the door ( a very rude girl that was very UNaccomodating) tried to seat us in this long skinny bed sort of thingie. My husband alone may not have fit on it and she thought we were both going to squeeze onto that. Ummm....no. Luckily we managed to get a super nice waitress to help find us a booth. We ended up sitting on the side opposite of the stadium seating side. It was cheaper, $25 pp and actually comfy and cool on that side. We had our own private flat screen TV as with most of the booths there. Our waitress was probably one of the best waitresses/attendants I have ever had anywhere. She was so sweet and came around often. We loved our food. We had the pork nachos and those were insanely good. I don't remember what else we had but it was all yummy. My husband had the vanilla milkshake with warm cookies and he said they were delicious. We won our football bets, cashed them in right there after the game...I would say the night was a success. Can't wait to watch another sporting event here soon. \n\nOh, also, there's rooms inside this place with blackjack and craps tables. What more could you ask for?"

My husband and I ventured to Lagasse's Stadium for his birthday and to watch the Texas/Cal bowl game.  We made a reservation a week ahead of time, which was not needed because the place wasn't packed like the hostess informed me it would be.  When I called about the reservation, the hostess told me that we would have to agree to a $50 per person minimum because of the bowl game.  I agreed, and then when we arrived, our server told us that this was not true.  The hostess had also told me that we would be able to enjoy a $15 for a bucket of domestic beers during happy hour from 4-8.  Much to my surprise, our server tells us this is also not true, that happy hour ends at 4.  Bummer.  We had the blue crab spinach artichoke dip which was very tasty.  \n\nThe main reason I'm rating this place so low is because the customer service is terrible.  Not only the miscommunications that occurred before we even arrived, but the guy running the televisions is a complete jerk.  We had a little issue with him (he changed tvs that us Texas fans were watching and told us to watch it on another one).  Ummm, no I will not do so, that's why I made a reservation.  To top things off, the place closes at 10, and all tvs got turned off at 9:15 and we were told that we had to leave because they were closed.  I understand there's \"bar time\", but 45 minutes ahead of time?  Soooo rude.  Emeril needs to micromanage his management here."

I would recomend requesting the sour cream on the side.  Your nachos come with a mountain of sour cream that covers most of the surface.\n\nOverall you definetely pay for the privilage, but for me it is well worth it.

The server, Angela, was the worst person I have ever come in contact with in the service industry (I eat out for business and personal more than three hundred days a year and I ain't talkin' restaurants with drive thrus).  Angela walked up spoke and then took our drink orders.  Beer was $36.00 for 6 domestic and $40.00 for anything other than that.  It's Vegas so that is on par.  Ordered chicken nachos, cheese managed to be greasy and without taste, chicken was sparse and again without flavor.  How do you screw up nachos.  And on top of that the portion was anything other than generous, but I guess that was a good thing. $14.00 for that lesson.  Steak sandwich $27.00. Good, but a little fatty and tough, bread was soaked with oil.  Decent portion, but one would expect better flavor from an Emeril restaurant.  BBQ Shrimp, four in greasy BBQ sauce with a few pieces of nuked(?) pieces of pita, $16.00 dollars, they were fresh, but again meh on flavor.  Pouring the greasy BBQ goop on boiled shrimp won't get it.  Shrimp sandwiches were very good, but I really wish that they had used maybe four shrimp for the sandwich rather than chopping up two. $17.00. MEH, MEH!, MEH!!, now why Angela will not be invited to the party.  She made no attempt to place the food in front of the person that ordered it and at one point when we tried to help, she purposely put the plates at the opposite end of the table from the person who placed the order, rolled her eyes, mumbled something and walked off.  When she got back, a member of my team was in the process of asking about his order, because he and another person had not received their order after ten minutes of the rest of the table receiving theirs, she stared at him and then as he was in mid sentence, she turned and asked if someone else wanted a water refill.  Shen then left the table.  We were in disbelief. Another server brought the food a few moments later. Angela showed back up and stared at me as she asked about dessert, I had had enough and said no, but a few members of my team said that they did not want our first real meeting break to be ruined by her and wanted to enjoy dessert.  I complied.  She again went out of her way to place our food away from us and at one point as one of the guys reached for his \"Sin Pie\" she moved it away from him and sat it in front of someone else! As we were eating our dessert, I noticed one of the guys at our table, Ken, had not received his shake, when I asked him about it he shrugged.  We saw Angela approaching and motioned for her.  She walked up and said \"what?\" Ken and the team at this point were done.  Ken stated that he had not received his shake, but did not want it and asked her to take it off the tab. She then said that his shake was ready and then pointed down to a little table where it had been sitting.  Before I could ask why if the shake had been sitting on a table on the lower level and she could have just brought it when she came up, she rolled her eyes and said okay and again walked off!  REALLY!  She brought the check and it of course had a twenty percent gratuity added.  My team was in full protest at this and I asked to speak to the manager.  I then understood the circumstances that led Angela to believe that her behavior was okay.  To say that he was indifferent would be in the top five understatements of the year.  After discussing their large party tipping policy, he finally said that he would remove the gratuity and I could tip as I saw fit.  He then left and gave the check to Angela.  While I could not feel good about twenty percent, I did give her ten as I did not want her to have to pay taxes on a tip that she did not get.  She returned the gift dinner cards that we paid with and stated that they had not gone through.  I asked if she was sure and she said yes.  I then gave her my Amex for the difference and left.  I had a member of my team check the gift card balances the next day and Angela had charged each one!  She had made sure that she had received a tip ($90.00 on a $270.00 bill!) I immediately called the restaurant and now they are \"looking into it\"  I now have to do a chargeback on my Amex.  NEVER AGAIN will I or anyone from my company set foot in this \"stadium\"."

Get over it people, you want a free place to watch the game, go down to the Imperial Palace.  \n\nOne big advantage of Lagasse's Stadium over the other sports books in Vegas is the speed of the drink service.  I never had to wait for a drink.  They were very attentive and on top of the drink service, even when using drink tokens.  At Mandalay Bay you'd see the waitress once in the first half and once in the second half, if you were lucky.\n\nOn to the food... The early morning menu is something I had a big problem with.  C'mon Emeril, you can do better than a hangover scramble and donut holes.  I tried the hangover special, the eggs were brutally over cooked, the sausage had no flavor and I couldn't find the potatoes in there.  The BAM was missing.  So Emeril, I know you're not a west coaster, so you probably don't get that we have to wake up crazy early on a Sunday morning for football, so some more variety and quality in the breakfast menu would be in order please.  I also got to try the wings... holy moly macaroni!  Killer wings, the right amount of heat and nicely balanced with a very creamy blue chesse sauce like you'd expect from Emeril.  Now I feel like I am eating at Emeril's.  The French Dip was the other menu item I got to try.  Wonderfully done sandwich with a flavorful Au Jus.  I did expect a little more from the french fries.  These were Burger King quality fries and that is not a compliment.\n\nSo to sum it up, a five star venue, great drink service and hit and miss food.  Kick it up a notch Emeril and make the rest of the offerings match the wings and the french dip and you'll have 5 stars."

We opted for a table which was a $50 per person, but that money went towards food and drinks. Going for a football game we would easily spend $50 a person so its not a bad deal. Food unfortunately was disappointing, at least what I got. Po'boy was OK and the Nachos was pretty gross. You know that taste of nacho cheese thats sat in the crock pot for way too long? Yeah... that was all over my nachos. On this last trip though, we went to watch the sharks game, sat at the bar and didn't have a fee to go in this time. Got a few drinks and grabbed some wings and pretzel with cheese. The wings were probably the best we had all week (tried 3-4 places for wings) and the pretzel was one of the best I've had. The cheese sauce for it was awesome and they also had some really good mustard. Not sure why the big difference in food quality between the two days, I'm guessing its because the playoff game the place was packed so food was rushed or just not to normal standards and this recent trip it was fairly dead."

The worst part is that I asked the waitress if the fries were gluten free and she asked the Chef and came back to let me know that they were.  Unfortunately within an hour, as we were going to our Vegas show I was sick  had to return to the hotel for the night, and had to miss the show (we had already paid for the tickets).  PLEASE PLEASE train your staff on what GLUTEN/WHEAT intolerance is.  No one wants to be poisoned, having eaten at several of Emeril's restaurants, I expected more."

Giant sports book with regular seating, or a giant stadium with couches and chairs to watch any sport until your heart is content?Yes please!\n\nI went with a huge group of friends, so we were in the restaurant area to start. Our waiter was great as he was able to keep up with about 10 of us which can be tricky at times. \n\nAfter checking out the menu, I settled on the Shrimp po'Boy ($16). The shrimp was fried on a griddle so it had a great crunch. Seasoning was Louisiana good. The french bread said it was New Orleans style and yes it was. Soft, tasty, wonderful French bread. Totally makes a po'Boy what it is. Also on the bread was lettuce, tomato and a slightly spicy Creole mayonnaise. I'm a po'Boy snob and this totally passed my test. \n\nThey also have a full bar, but wow I was in food love, so I didn't even pay attention to it. \n\nFor a nice place to hang with friends, watch sports and eat good food, this is the place."

My wife and I were still a little full from the previous night's dinner, so we decided to split some appetizers.  We ordered the chicken nachos and a basket of onion rings.  The order of nachos were huge but were nothing special.  I really liked the salsa, but other than that they were just typical nachos put together badly.  There were clumps of chicken all one side, all the onions were on the other side, and the cheese was kind of hard and not melted by  the time we got them.  The onion rings were very delicious though.\n\nThe setting is very nice inside.  They have stadium style seating with comfortable couches.  There are plenty of TVs so you don't have to worry about missing any action of any game.  This place would be great for Sunday football."

There are rooms with sofas and huge plasma tv's and its a great place to bring the boys and watch your team.  It's difficult on the weekends to get one of these rooms but during the week not bad.  The main seating area has a TV in every nook and corner and if you can't find a place to watch at least 5-6 games with clarity then you are crazy.  For viewing sports and the energy, I give it 5 stars.\n\nI give the food 3-4 stars.  It's bar food, yep.  It's a cut above your normal bar food in taste, but out of every 8-9 items I think you get a bad one.  cold, or over cooked, or something.  The place is big but with big places comes a another level of quality control that you can't give up on, and have to work twice as hard, to deliver on.\n\nI give 2-3 stars for the greeters/waiters-waitresses and customer service in general.  Don't plan on needing anything on a busy night in a hurry.  give em credit, there's just a ton of people in here on a busy night, but again they should staff accordingly."

I despise the University of Alabama, but I won't let that tarnish my review of this great sports bar. \n\nThis place is very unique, nicely styled, and in my opinion the best smoke-free place to catch the big game! \n\nBeware that this is not the place to catch obscure games you might normally find at a sports bar. This place serves as the viewing area for the Palazzo's sports book. Because of this, what plays on the screens is dictated by the amount of money bet on a given game. That makes it perfect for catching the big game, but not so much if you want to see something that isn't the focus of betting for the weekend. If you want that, reserve a table because most of them have their own TVs. \n\nOverall, the food seems very generic. We shared several appetizers. The wings were basic, the Chicken Nachos were disappointing. I did enjoy the pretzels and my huge Caesar salad though.\n\nTIPS! \n- Make sure you reserve a seat in the \"stadium area\" a week or so in advance, especially if it is a big game.\n- I don't know if they do this all of the time, but at least for big games they have a $50 minimum, which isn't really hard to meet. \n- The pretzel appetizer is delicious! The Caesar salad was awesome. Pair it with their margarita pitcher for extra deliciousness and that should make your $50 minimum!\n\nEmeril did a great job creating this unique take on the Vegas sports book/sports bar!"

Sounds good right? WRONG! This place had below mediocre food, let me elaborate a little, bad food for a sports bar. Any sports bar will have a certain poor quality of food, but this place was horrendous and way overpriced. I had one of the worst pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had in my life, the meat was soggy as if it were steamed not bbq'ed and tasted completely like vinegar. There was barely any coleslaw in the sandwich and my fries were cold. I couldn't get over the terrible vinegar taste. My buddy ordered the specialty steak sandwich which for some reason is $27 (wtf?), it was very small and had no flavor at all. My other friends ordered Kobe-Angus burgers that made McDonald's and Carls Jr's Angus burgers look gourmet. \n\nOur table service was annoying as well, our waiter was always in a rush to leave our table and for no reason, most of the time he was just talking to another co-worker on the side. Then it took forever to get food and when our overpriced beers came they were served in little dinky plastic cups. \n\nThe only positive things I can say about this place is that we were seated quickly and there was plenty of screens to watch the games on. The interior of the sports bookie is impressive and looks pretty plush. But I'm pretty sure Emeril has never even set foot in this sham, and hopefully when he does he tells them to take his name off of this BS."

The sound was on for the UFC and was decent.\n\nI initially thought they were charging cover for this UFC event but actually they were just requiring minimum food/beverage purchases of $100 per person in the stadium seating or $50 per person for a table.  this is quite reasonable, IMO.  I ordered chili cheese fries ($13) and because my friends were eating healthy I ate these all by myself and they were way better than I expected.  I was planning to order a bunch of different food but because the chili cheese fries were so filling I just ordered a steak ($37).

Of all the places we went for dinners &/or drinks, there were two occasions on which the customer service was less than desirable & Lagasse's Stadium takes the cake for being the worst. We spent a lot of time at the Palazzo during our trip & gave this place a shot. We walked in & took a seat. It was the early afternoon & there were only one or two other people in the establishment, no joke. The bar tender never gave us the time of day. She definitely saw us but she was very busy, chatting up a couple of other girls. I think one of them might have been another employee but one of them was just a friend of the other girls visiting, or so it seemed. We sat there for a good 10 or 15 minutes, obvious glances coming our way but no service. They never did come to take out order. I can honestly say that Lagasse's Stadium is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They should really restaff because at least some of their staff doesn't give a damn about customers (or apparently their tips, surprisingly), or the reputation of their restaurant. I have never been in a place where the staff literally refused to acknowledge us. I will never waste time walking through their doors again and I will never say a kind word about them. Sorry, Emeril, but your staff is letting you and your fans down. My only  regret is not finding out the name of the staff so I can be more specific in my complaints and report them to their management, although that probably wouldn't have mattered. They have plenty of terrible reviews besides this one & I'm sure their management is not oblivious to the fact... you would think they would try to make difference.\n\nThis is the one and only time in my life that I have walked out of a restaurant without ordering because the service was so poor."

I had the \"spicy\"-ist dish on the menu, the meatloaf and it was bland except for having way too much salt. The service was awful and we sat at the bar. Walk over to nearby Delmonico instead. It's much better.\n\nI hope they paid him a lot of money for his name because having this place is putting a severe dent in his brand."

Funny thing is, it was absolutely dead AND we had a reservation... But they still sat us in a little booth far away from the rest of the world.  I couldn't even hear what was going on the screen of my dear Lakers playing, and instead had to listen to the commentary during the Knicks game.  Bleh!\n\nOddly enough, when asked what we wanted to watch and I requested the Lakers game...  The hostess responded with \"Oh, well it's not on for another hour anyway\"... When the game was actually starting in 5 minutes.  Hmm... As a result, it took them 15 minutes to finally change the channel on our screen.\n\nThe food is a little better quality than your run of the mill dive... But it's still bar food.  I had the sweet potato fries and the Rueben.  Both were good, but not amazing or anything.  \n\nNeedless to say, we left during the 2nd quarter of the game.  I would have been pretty irritated if we had to pay the $50 minumum per person tab that they sometimes require.  Probably won't be back here on my future trips to Sin City."

We checked it out on Saturday afternoon -- it was still packed for the college games -- and got tips from the hostesses to show up really early for NFL Sunday the next day.  They had no reservations left for Sunday so we would need to get their early to fend for ourself.\n\nOn Sunday, we arrive at 8am ... a full two hours before the first kickoff.   We were so early that the hostesses had not arrived yet, although about 5 cocktail tables overlooking a bank of TVs were already taken.  When we finally found a hostess, she was amazingly helpful in getting us prime seats on one of the stadium couches. (Note: They have a 75 to 100 seat stadium area overlooking a massive TV plus 12 other flat screens.  There are also Cabana style alcoves and regular restaurant seating.  Lastly, a patio exists overlooking L.V. Blvd, but who knows why.)  They told us that reservations are usually filled at least one month out for NFL games.  However, she fit us into a stadium couch for the 10am games provided we would give up our seats for a 1pm reservation.  NO PROBLEM!  Plus they only charged the $50 minimum for both of us, not each.\n\nIt really was a heavenly way to watch the game.  Really like the circus ... true visual overload.  And what a concept to have a sports book mere feet away from the couch?  If only I had that at home!\n\nOn the flip side, I was generally underwhelmed with the food.  It was fine, but far from what I would expect with Emeril's own name on it.  Everything was just standard fare -- the only memorable thing we ate was their Creole Shrimp Sandwich (basically their po boy) which was tasty, light and flavorful.   Everything else lacked any cajun or upscale flair.  Fortunately, the food prices were very reasonable (my suggestion: increase prices by 33% and make it Emeril worthy!).\n\nOverall, we had a great time -- it was more the experience than the food.  Now if only Brett Favre would get a defense that would not blow their huge lead in the 4th quarter so my Vikings -3 wager would not have been wasted on a 2 point win!"

We had really high hopes & overall it was a let down. We had a 7pm reservation, arrived at 6:55, & stood for 35 minutes waiting to get seated in the stadium area. They make it very clear when you call the minimum of $100 a head for food & bev. Not so clear is being seated a half hour after the reservation & missing the 1st 15-20mins of the big game. Once seated you feel the need to rush into ordering a large amount to make a dent into that $100 per person. The food & drink did arrive timely & the waiters are attentive but the food & drink was less than stellar. Maybe a small notch above Hooters or the like. With Mr. Bam's name front & present you expect better. They also really need to have a hostess re-training session. Teach them to seat more than one group at a time in the stadium area & how to be friendlier to patrons spending a lot of money for over priced fare. I'd sum up Lagasse's stadium as falling real close to the category of tourist trap."

If you are going on football Sunday make sure you make reservations (i think it may have been extra bad because we went during playoff season). We didn't know and just showed up wanting to watch a game and get some food. The hostess told us it was around an hour wait and that they would seat us after the current games were over. The hostesses were not very helpful and were all very rude....an hour wait ended up being over a 2 hour wait to be seated and we only waited that long because we had been in line waiting and didn't want to leave after having waited. To top things off after waiting that long the hostess let us know that there was a $50/person spending minimum to be seated....did they tell us that 2 hours ago before we started waiting...no! We had to speak to the manager and they finally waived that price....the waiter was very unhappy when he found this out though and was very rude, short, and inattentive with us. My friend got a burger and luckily didn't choke when he bit down on a bone! Atmosphere is great but the food is so/so and the service is horrendous!

I don't believe it for one second.  Why would a chef who made a name for himself using Cajun spices, create a concept that is challenged by almost any other sports bar ANYWHERE in the US?\n\nI was there with a group of people for a work function.  The set up was nice, we had a private room with our own bar and a table full of apps.  Ill give credit where credit is due, the wings were very good.  But every other app (veggie plate, egg rolls, fried something gross, pigs in a blanket) were all mediocre at best.  It tasted like they had an industrial sized box of anytizers that they just cranked out to keep our party of 20 fed.\n\nThe main meal was not much better, between the cheese burger and the upscale steak sandwich, I was just not impressed.  The sandwich was overcooked, the bread was bland, and the blue cheese and onion mixture reminded me of a recipe in \"My first cook book.\"  But again, credit must go to the Parmesan truffle fries that came on the side, they were incredible.\n\nThe service is the only reason that I am not giving one star.  All of the people who worked our room were very attentive, friendly, and personable.  They worked very hard to ensure that we had a good time and always kept our drinks topped off.\n\nAlso, Emeril,...Work on the sports memorabilia on the walls.  The unsigned $7 Brett Favre jersey that you clearly bought at Kmart and framed brings the ambiance down.  I have a drawer full of old Jersey's with no value, let me know if you run out."

This is pretty nice for a sports bar/restaurant/sportsbook. I like that they have stadium like seating in front of the bigger screens and comfy couches instead of a bench. Pretty big place too and crazy amount of TV's. In the dining room it was like 1 TV to each table. Food okay, but it caters more to being a comfortable spot to watch some HD sports. \n\nWe get a limited choice for each course, but these are our picks.\n\nBoth of us got Italian Sausage Arancinis appetizer- pieces of sausage and risotto rolled into a ball and fried, served with marinara. Pretty good- kinda has a crunchy \"hash brown crisp\" to the outside, simple white wine risotto, sausage was sparse though....I was thinking it was going to feature more sausage than tiny dots in the rice....still it was a good nosh type food. \n\nMains- half rack of ribs served with jalapeno cornbread and grouper fish and chips. Rack was soft meat, but it wasn't as smoky/seasoned as I liked, but decent. Definitely better meat quality than going to like a usual chain like a Chilis, but about as much flavor effort (salt pepper ribs later dunked in sauce to serve it...where's the Emril Creole Dry Rub? ), nothing too memorable, a filling portion though. Cornbread needed more butter, it wasnt too dry but it was on that cusp where it coulda done wonders to have a smidgeon of it. Jalapeno flakes were seen, but no spice nor flavor was added from it being there- I just tasted the sweet corn flavor. Fish was panko flaked crusted and drizzled with malt vinegar reduction and came with a lemon tartar sauce- this was fresh fish, and the sauces were nice on it. Came with waffle cut fries, crispy but pretty standard waffle fries....I love waffle fries more than regular ones so this kinda made me happy. For ketchup they gave me a cute individual baby Heinz bottle. \n\nDessert- Chocolate Cupcake with cream cheese frosting and a Cheesecake with fruits.  Server said that people come for the cupcake. Wasn't even a cupcake at all- it was a dense chocolate cake that looked like it was baked in a large dessert/souffle ramekin...it was served warm so more like a molten lava cake without the molten.  Cream cheese frosting is supposed to be dense, this was a cross of like if they put buttercream and cream cheese flavoring together and they just put a smidge of it on top the big cake and served with raspberries.Meh, I ran out of \"frosting\" and fruits before I can take much bites out of this and it's just too dense on it's own. I'm sure for some people they love this kind of thing, but the dense chocolate cakes are not for me. Cheesecake was pretty standard New York style- good but nothing special. \n\nService- it was alright with filling drinks and such consistently through our meal, but then at the end we were held hostage waiting to get our server to notice us so we can ask for the check. Yeah he got busy with a few tables that just got in, but prioritize! People just arrived and wont be pissy if you let them \"browse the menu\" for a while longer than make people sit there for 10 minutes doing nothing, wanting to leave. I couldn't get his attention either...when I'm done I'm pretty obvious- I look in the servers direction and when I'm hostage I even turn my body to the side towards the server, away from my food.\n\nI'm sure this is nice for sports fans to gather, but just okay foods that wont bring back a non sports person like me back. Yeah we got a employee deal, but even with that- eh, rather go for another restaurants Venetian employee deal. I'll give them 3 normally but maybe bump to 3.5 stars simply because we got a really good deal on the 3 courses."

The TV set-up is marginal, one big display and 8 small ones on which you cannot see the detail of the game from the back of the stadium. The food and drink are ok and free. It cost us $100 for the seat and then the food was free up to $100 per person. This was enuf to eat and drink anything on the menu for a few hours.They told us they were sold out for the evening so we sat for the a few hours for $50 a piece then they sold us seats for the main event which were available when came in. Just poor management\n\nGet your act together and you have can over a great experience instead of an ok experience. Super Bowl SUnday was $500 per person, be difficult to spend that much during the game. It was sold out so people may not care"

We arrived ten minutes prior to our reservation time, and we were told our table would not be ready. They shuffled us to a waiting room with limited seating to wait for our table. \n\n20 minutes after our game started we were shuffled to our table. Don't worry, if you don't remember what the minimum was, your waitress will tell you. It almost feels as though they know how much you are going to spend so they don't even have to try to give good customer service. \n\nWe were a party of six and asked our waitress Kara to let us know when we were close. She informed us she was leaving before the game was over, seriously, did we need to know this? A simple okay would have sufficed. She took our order without enthusiasm, almost as if we were over staying our welcome by ordering. Each time she came to the table it seemed like it was a huge inconvenience for her. She got our requests wrong on drink orders and didn't even apologize when she brought the wrong thing. She walked away from our table each time with a sour look on her face. \n\nMark replaced her after halftime. I must say he was a breath of fresh air. Servers need to realize that a smile and an extra few seconds at a table instead of walking away while your guest is still taking to you makes a huge difference. Providing bad service can seriously damper the mood of the entire party, I know it killed the vibe at our table.\n\nThe food was really good, however, the way you are seated on the couches limits the intake of food you can have while being comfortable. \n\nNot worth the money in my opinion."

A big positive is you can bet on games inside the restaurant and they even have some blackjack tables in a room inside the restaurant as well.   If you want to sit down in the stadium seating section, you have to make reservations way in advance and there is no way you will get those seats as a walk-in.  But, make a reservation to get a good table or else you will be standing the entire game.\n\nThere is a $50 minimum per person per game for watching NFL games.  So, come hungry and thirsty.  The service is a little chaotic and slow especially at 10 AM when everyone just sat down in all the seats, so expect a little wait if you order food early.   \n\nAs for the food, I really liked the chicken wings and Emeril's BBQ Shrimp.  However the Nachos with pulled pork was our favorite.  A big plus is the recipe is available at Emeril's web site.  The Alaskan King crabs were good, but a little expensive for $65 for what you get."

I think this is probably OK to do on Saturdays for college football but I wouldn't try it on a Sunday.  We attempted to go back on Sunday for pro games and it was very crowded and we would not have been able to get a seat.  I think you either have to make a reservation, get a casino host to make a reservation for you, or get there pretty early to get seats for pro football.\n\nThe hostess explained that our options were a loveseat-style sofa/bed in the stadium area, which required a $50 per person spend per game, or these other sofa seats in a different section which required a $25 per person spend per game.  We were leaning toward the $25 area but we decided to do the $50 instead to get the stadium seating and the giant screen.\n\nHaving just eaten brunch before we got there, we knew we'd be spending our $50 each almost exclusively on drinks.  Therefore, we ordered them up and got them coming.  I think I drank my weight in vodka.  Anyhow, I had a LOT to drink and maybe my only complaint (???) is that the drinks are too cheap!  I ordered five vodka drinks and a soda and I was not at my $50 yet.  The bloody marys are big and are $10 - based on other places in Palazzo/Venetian, I was expecting them to cost anywhere from $12-$14.  My friend ordered a bucket of beer plus two extra beers, and chicken wings, and he was not at his $50 yet.  Our server was very nice and told us that we didn't have to leave after the game we'd agreed to and as long as we kept ordering stuff, she wouldn't make us do another $50 spend.  We stayed a bit longer but not too long and when we closed out, we were still not at $100.  But, they very nicely only charged us for what we had plus tax, and the total was $100 and some change.  I thought that was great.  The service was very good overall - we had at least three servers always popping by to see if we needed anything else.  Everyone was really friendly.  The big screen and the surrounding little screens are great, too, and the sports book is right down front so it's easy to get your bets in.\n\nThey also have an outdoor area with lots of TVs and comfy seats, which is kind of rare for the Strip and for a sports book.  It's nice out there.\n\nI'd go again but would make sure to get there early to get a nice seat and also not eat before going so that I could more easily reach my minimum spend.  They also have video poker seating in the way back, which was a nice little break for me, and the women's bathrooms are very large, nice and never crowded."

We all really liked the ambiance and the many televisions with various sports game on, except the place was such a mad house it was impossible to get a seat and order food.\n\nFast forward a few years... I decided to come down and check it out the place and catch whatever game happened to be on (Red Socks vs Blue Jays), although I should have waited and try to watch the Giants game (which was on one of the small screens).  Trying to make a reservation on Open Table was a total no-go, as I tried various days and time combinations and the system essentially told me that there were no open tables within 2.5 hr of my desired reservation time. I then tried calling the restaurant directly and was able to get a reservation for anytime before 4:30pm.  OpenTable must have had a glitch - technology 0, friendly hostess that answered the phone 1!  \n\nI arrived early, but the place was still relatively deserted so I would have been able to get a place to sit even without a reservation.  The menu is pretty simple, appetizers, burgers, pizzas, steaks and seafood.  I opted for the Grilled Ribeye, but the kitchen substituted the Stacked \"Brew City\" Onion Rings with Roasted Garlic Smashed Potatoes and Grilled Asparagus.  I didn't realized it at the time, but I think I ended up with better sides for my Main Event selection.  The Grilled Ribeye was tasty, and a nice juicy medium rare, and maybe the best item on the entire menu even at $30.\n\nI also ended up getting a Chocolate Shake and Chocolate Chip Cookies.  It felt like a good ten minute had passed before the dessert was finally brought out.  But the cookies were warm and the chocolate chips were nice and gooey.\n\nService was friendly, but perhaps understaffed.  I think only one waiter and busser/backup was on the clock when I arrived, and two more gals \"clocked in\" by the time I was waiting for my bill.  Needless to say there were no auto-refills, until I placed my dessert order and asked for the refill.\n\nOverall, I like Lagass's Stadium and the food it serve.  Dessert menu was very limited (just 4 items) and seems an afterthought.  But as a place to hangout and watch the popular games, especially during prime time, I think I will pass.  $100 minimum food and beverage minimum is steep for the privilege of parking my rear end on their lounge seats during a NFL game.  Seating options:  lounge or traditional table or at the bar.\n\nFood:  3.5/5  My ribeye was good, dessert shake was okay.  Features your typical sports bar menu of hot wings, burgers, fries, pizza, and that grilled ribeye!  The menu options are not terribly exciting and dare I say just a wee bit blas\u00e9.\n\nService:  3.5/5 Friendly, but a bit shorthanded when I patronized the slick sportsbar/restaurant.\n\nParking:  4/5  I generally have not had issues with parking here, so knock on wood and hope my luck continues.\n\nAtmosphere:  varies, depending on the time and game that is televised on the main projectored screen.\n\nValue:  3/5  Basically paying the typical Strip premium overall. So if you are seeking value then this is not for you (although it is not outrageously bad), but if you are here for the convenience and rowdy crowd on game day, make a reservation and come on time!\n\n3.5 stars!"

Aren't po-boys with seafood inside suppose to be fried? A hamburger, which I would rate below average,  and some cheese fries which again did not impress.  As I said,  the only highlight was the waitress who was very professional and personable.  We will definitely not come back or if so,  we are not ordering any food."

This was my 5th time booking a lounge area for sporting events and it seems like every time the experience gets even better.  I initially dealt with the General Manager, Gerry to book my lounge area for a party of 7.  He was professional and put me through to the right person, Sylvia who handled the reservation efficiently over email.  Day of arrival I was met by a familiar face, Taylor who sat our party each day with a pretty smile. Moments later I was greeted warmly by our server for the 4 days, Heather, who couldn't have been any better.  She and her partner, Derek attended to our groups every need and since we were there from 8am-8pm for 4 days during the opening round of the NCAA tournament, there were lots of needs!  Change the channel , more food , more drinks , suggestions for nighttime activities .   The food is first class, better than any sports bar in the country in my opinion.  The chef came out himself a couple of times to make sure we were happy with everything.  The tomahawk steak, spicy meatloaf sandwich, and shrimp n grits, we're all favorites of our group.  \n\nIf you plan to go to Vegas to watch any sporting event, this is an absolute slam dunk!"

It looks pretty much the same now but with lots of sports memorabilia on the walls. We took one of the stadium seats which was essentially a large bed (in retrospect, not the best idea if you're eating, FABULOUS idea if you're trying to watch the game on a really big screen). Good thing we didn't get anything that required utensils or this would have been really tricky. My sandwich was great but the service was a little off. We asked for the bill as soon as we finished. This took more than 20 minutes and during this time our server was walking around but never passed by us until we waved her down. I didn't want to chance another 20 minutes on getting change from her so I went directly to the bar. After 2 minutes went to the other side of the bar and one bartender literally then went to the side I was at; I got my change, but the person who gave it to me put it directly on the puddle of water on the counter instead of into my extended hand. A little strange. Good lunch, but I don't think I'll be back."

We didn't know this until the conversation turned to their 4th food order, but she explained that in order to keep your seat for the entire game, you gotta order up and often. They paid $50/person to reserve the couch for 3 hours. On top of that, you MUST order food and beverages for the duration of your visit. To the point that the waiters/waitresses stop by and give you the \"what's next?\" approach, rather than the \"are you doing ok? Would you LIKE to order something else?\" It's strange.  I know Vegas is where the money is made, but this is a bit much. \n\nI would say it's a good place to catch a game. Plenty of TV's, solid food menu, full bar etc. I just don't now that it's worth dropping close to $200 to watch the game. It's definitely more intimate than standing in the sports book hoping to catch the game, but it's just way over the top! I would definitely figure out another plan if I were in town for a game."

After much discussion they responded to our request for a table with a notification that there was a $25 minimum per person for food and drink. We said that was fine. \n\nWhen we arrived at our table (and there were plenty of open seats), our waitress greeted us and  before saying anything else ensured that we knew there was a $25 minimum per person. We said that we understood. She then left and returned with A DOCUMENT WE WERE REQUIRED TO SIGN indicating that we understood about the minimum. At that point I asked if this was done for everyone. She replied by saying that the minimum is usually higher and then telling me that she needed a credit card to keep throughout the meal to ensure we met the minimum. \n\nI gave her a card and told her the entire experience was incredibly off putting. \n\nThe service for the rest of the meal was mediocre.

This was my husband's and I fifth time to Vegas this year and we always stay at the Venetian. This was also one of our friend's first time to Sin City. I had done some online research for places to go that did specials or happy hour. Lagasse's Stadium which used to be Jay-Z's old club 40/40 Club showed a happy hour special(M-F 3-7pm): $15 bucket of domestic beer (6 bottles), $20 cocktail pitchers and $5 apps. So we planned on hitting the happy hour Friday night before the Portland Trailblazer game. We showed up with a party of 8 and they put us in a sky box. We decided to order a bucket of beers and a pitcher of margaritas. The super cute cocktail waitress told us our bucket of beer options (bud light, coors light and Sierra Nevada). Sierra Nevada!? Really??? We couldn't believe that was one of the options! The cocktail waitress said they worked out some kind of deal with Sierra Nevada. Jackpot! We decided to order two buckets. The options for the cocktail pitchers (margarita, cosmos and long islands) we decided to go with margaritas.  The $5 app selection was pretty slim (mini chili dogs, artichoke dip and potato skins) and as the waitress explained pretty small. We tried one of each any way! The apps were small, but overall ok. We also ordered the pork nachos (not so great) and my husband ordered the chicken avocado wrap and thought it was just average. We had to send back the pitcher of margaritas, everyone agreed that something was wrong. The waitress had no problem sending it back and brought us back a pitcher of long islands. She said the bartender did admit to something being wrong with the margarita. The Long Islands were great! Our group of booze hounds ended up ordering another pitcher of Long Islands as well as two more buckets of Sierra Nevada! \nFor pure boozing, sports watching and cute cocktail waitresses, our group fell in love with Lagasse's Stadium. The bar food is average, we saw some of the dinner entrees come out (roasted chicken and BBQ ribs) and the portions were HUGE! \nWe went to Lagasse's Stadium that Sunday for NFL Football as well as Monday for MNF. We loved the fact we could place our sports bets there and get free drink tickets and we even played with the handheld pocket casinos, which was a Blast!\nCan't wait to get back to Vegas and get some bets in at Lagasse's!!!"

I've watched NFL, MLB games, the World Cup, and now the 2014 Winter Olympics at this sports' restaurant.\n\nYou have the main central area where the most important game is being shown on their largest screen.  You have stadium seating that contains sofas, couches, seat cushions & coffee tables.  Plus, you'll have someone taking your orders and delivering your food to you!

My 49ers weren't on the big screen, but I was able to find them somewhere else where I was able to sit & watch that game comfortably.

From the ginormous monster TV with recliner and sofa seating, to smaller booths and tables with smaller TV's...it's great to view the games.\n\nThe menu is upscale bar food, it's not the usual amazing presentation and taste of an Emeril restaurant.

I've tried several things from the burger & fries, chicken fingers, caesar salads w/chicken (fav), chicken satay, among others -- and drafts and bottle beers.\n\nI find the service attentive, and the environment fun.  Of course, since it's located in a hotel on the strip, parking and getting to it quickly is a problem vs a stand-alone place...but I don't fault the restaurant for that.\n\nOkay, so maybe it's not a homerun, but I'd say it's a solid triple, Mr Lagasse, nice job."

First off, let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Emeril and I've followed his culinary career for years including the tv shows. This restaurant is laid out as a sports. At which is very nice and there are tons of tvs to see the games. NICE!!! What I did not like is the fact that the wait to be seated is a hot damn mess.... You tell them you want to be seated then you go wait by the bar and then a server will find you and seat you. They don't take your name or anything they just find you. Mistake #1. Secondly, it's very loud in there and people are sitting 9-10 at a four top which makes it tight at your table beside them. Lastly, the food was just okay. I thought it would be amazing but it was just good. I had the fish and chips and sub the wedges for the parmasean fries which were pretty good! My friend for the steak bam wich which she loved and for apps we got the pretzel with cheese and some wings. Do not get the jalape\u00f1o cornbread. It ha absolutely no flavor when it came to the table. I am\nNot sure if they were having a bad night but it was not a great first impression. I'm sure Emeril would have been dissatisfied as well. Not sure if I'd go back..."

The food is standard sports bar food, mostly deep fried options and burgers/steaks. \n\nFOOD\nUnimpressive and overpriced.\n\nAMBIENCE\nIt's fun to watch the games at a sports bar with people all decked out in their various jerseys, cheering when their team scores and groaning when they lose.  \n\nBe warned there are several tables that at are awkwardly laid out and have poor view of TV's or can only see one screen.\n\nCOST\nIt is WAY overpriced.

I had to send back the creole Burger as I ordered it rare and the waitress saw me cut into it only to be disappointed by a medium Burger. The second one was cooked beautifully and the sausage, onions, and cheese were a welcome addition on the Burger. Fries weren't anything spectacular, very salty with the seasoning. Wife had shrimp and grits; grits were a Al dente and stood up well to the creole seasoned shrimp. Beer selection is nothing great but they do have Dogfish Head 60 minute bottles. Overall a nice way to catch a game; if you're in the couch areas expect you might sit near annoying drunks -but hey its Vegas right? Call to make reservations as open table stated nothing was available and we were able to get a spot with our own TV to catch the game on a Sunday afternoon."

Well, I wasted a lot of time taking him down here - had several other choices and he would have seen the first half of the game instead of being treated rudely by the hostess staff, bar staff and a security guard that followed us around the bar area.\n\nGot there about 12:45 on a NFL Sunday.\n\nCalled to make reservations the day before. Told me they do not take reservations.\n\nThe do not greet you friendly or welcoming.\n\nIf you are a nice looking 60 year old man ( okay he might be 60 but he looks 45 and it really pisses me off) and a little bit frumpy 50 year old wife.....the two hostess look at you like with a look that makes you feel like you should just go away and not bother them.\n\nIf you get past the stink eye and approach, there is no greeting - \"We aren't seating anyone until the next game and the place is standing room only.\"   You are dismissed.  okay I added the you are dismissed. But she did proceed to turn her shoulder and return to her conversation with the other hostess.\n\nMy husband asked if he could sit at the bar.  She rolls her eyes...yes, a complete 360 degree eye roll and says \"it is standing room only.\"  You will have to wait until the next game or about an hour an a half.   Well, he wanted to see the next game - so he says great, that is the game I want to see.  Can I wait at the bar?  Her response is \"it is standing room only.\"   I am peeking in the entry and it does not appear standing room only.  I can see some empty chairs at the bar but I want to end this so I don't mention them to the husband.  And there were people standing around but they appeared to be all members of the staff and a security guard.  I can also see several empty tables on the upper level and some chairs along the rail.  \n\nI tell my husband that we should just go somewhere else.  He asks the other hostess if he can just go in the bar area and look at the screens for some scores.   Zowie - we get a double eye roll.  In tandem.  At this point I want to be anywhere else but here.   But my husband is excited about a room built for football viewing and just wanted to take a look.  He tells the two at the hostess stand he is just going to take a look.\n\nSo my husband proceeds to wander in.  I had his back in case any lasers came out from the hostess stand or the eye rolls proved to also have a lethal setting.   I want to leave.  But he just wanted to take a look around.  It is a multi-level venue with large flat screens, really big screens and the jumbo tron of football viewing.  The upper deck has a bar, several sitting areas, access to the outside seating - which was completely empty, and seating along a long rail looking out over the \"stadium\" .  The lower area is tiered seating with big white comfy looking seats you can lounge on, going down to a area with dining tables and another bar.\n\nThere are empty seats at the bar by the door leading outside and a empty table with 4 comfortable chairs and a couch in front of a TV.  My husband stops to look at the jumbo tron - the main viewing area screens are huge.  I stop by my husband and look around.... the security guard from the front door is 4 feet away from us trying to look invisible.  I am looking around and husband is looking at scores and security guard starts to tap his foot.  Now I realize, we are being escorted.  God forbid we sit down or talk to the bar tender.  I ask the bartender if there are any seats and he said yes!!!!  I point out the security guard to  the husband and the fact there are chairs open at the bar.  He says he does not feel comfortable and just wants to see one more score.\n\nThe bar tender says so are you guys sitting down or just standing there and I realize we are the only people standing.  My husband points out that with so many games going you don't much cheering, laughter or sound of people having a good time.  He was right, I have been in a lot of sports bars - the joy of being married to a football fan - and this just felt wrong.  Not fun.  Not excited.  Just hostile. \n\nWe walk around the upper deck to the other side, stopping every 10 feet or so to see if the guard walks on by - nope, he stays four feet away and shadows us the whole way back to the front door.\n\nTo the right of the entrance there is a private gaming area.  We did not linger too long to look because Barney Fife might have had permission to use his one bullet on us.  \n\nWe decided to walk down to Delmonico's and have some lunch and watch the end of the first game on the TV in their bar.   Michelle and Doug were wonderful and the food was great.\n\nAs we left another group was outside Lagasse's complaining about how rude the staff was and how they screwed up their bill.\n\nWhen we were enjoying our lunch at Delmonico's, several groups came in....all coming from Lagasse's....complaining about how unpleasant their experience at Lagasse's was on December 23, 2012."

We were fortunate enough to get a table last minute outside facing the LV strip to catch the Dubs game. \n\nLagasse Stadium is like getting bottle service except with food/drink and sports minus the eye-catching women. I believe that we were saddled with a $30/person minimum to spend which is attainable. The service was very good as our server was friendly and checked in with us frequently. \n\nThe food was exceptional. The buttermilk fried chicken was one of the best things I ate on my trip; flavorful and moist (I'm talking about the food) The sweet potato fries and cinnamon sugar dipping sauce is some food ingenuity. It tasted a lot like churro fries, if there was such a thing. This is the 3rd food establishment of Emeril's I've been to in Vegas and have yet to have been disappointed. \n\nMy only thing of note was I wish they would regulate with patrons just wandering and sitting on the couch that is suppose to be reserved for groups. Toward the end of our time at Lagasse, a small group of people (Asian, go figure right? but it's okay for me to say that because I'm Asian) just helped themselves to the couch next to ours and caught the end of the game. Not that they interfered with our viewing experience but just a side note. \n\nI also wish the TVs were placed higher along the pillars. Because the servers/dining guests would walk by frequently and it would impair the line of vision. That is all and I look forward to returning to LS in the future."

Chosen for dinner during Kings vs. Blackhawks Game 3 it was with friends that I found myself seated on the Strip-side patio of The Palazzo property and with low tables arranged around individual LCDs as a sub-60 degree cross-breeze rendered things quite chilly our meal progressed in three courses, the plates themselves thankfully arriving from the white toques of the kitchen while beverage refills and service languished at the hands of unapologetically undertrained staff.  Formerly visited as Jay-Z's 40/40 Club many years prior and largely unchanged in theme or d\u00e9cor since it was MMA and NBA that dominated the warmer indoor seating and admittedly a bit perturbed to begin my mood soon changed as Los Angeles took the lead and food began to arrive, an opening volley of creamy $10 Artichoke Dip and an $18 golden disc spot-on for the flavors of NOLA's signature sandwich both delicious and big enough to share.  Shying away from items like shrimp and grits previously experienced at other Emeril locales round two of the meal continued the bar-food trend and while the liver on the burger was overcooked and meager the patty, fries, and aioli all shined - a compliment even more befitting the juicy fried chicken whose crunchy batter and hefty spice profile rival the best in the Valley.  Ever happy to indulge in dessert, even after the sinful frosting-paired sweet potato fries, it was midway into the third period that I finally placed an order and arriving just as the horn sounded the meal ended just as it did over ten years prior - an ethereal bread pudding rife with vanilla and booze alongside a slice of the Banana Cream Pie equally responsible for building an empire as the word Bam!"

The lady I spoke with on the phone said the cost is \"$75.00 for the table\" which I agreed to.  I also asked if it would be the table that has couches, she said no because they are already sold out and we would be at a table.  \n\nWhen we showed up Sunday they told us our table isn't ready yet so we had to wait 30mins before it was.  Once they finally sat us at our table we noticed how empty it was around us and were baffled why we had to wait so long.  \n\nThen our waiter immediately comes to our table to get me to sign an agreement that the cost will be a minimum of $75 per person(we had a group of 3 so now we owe $225).  I was in disbelief since I was told the cost would be $75 for the table.  I asked for the manager, told him our situation and he reluctantly lowered the price down to $150 ($50 per person).  We paid the $150 but we were unimpressed with the service and will never return.  \n\nThe icing on the cake was when I got up from my table walked around and noticed how many empty tables with the nice couches were vacant.  I then asked how much would it cost for the tables with the couches and they told me $75 per person\n\nWhy tell me you're sold out of those tables when you aren't? Horrible communication and management on Lagasse's part.  I would give this place ZERO stars if that was an option.  This place is to be avoided."

Like a true (but sorry) Cardinals fan I checked in at 12:45, 1:00, 1:15, etc.  Each time I was told that the 10:00 o'clock game was still finishing up or that the tables were being cleared for seating which to some degree I understand.  What I don't understand in a place that is that busy, number 1 doesn't have a system for seating people and number 2 has nowhere for folks to sit in the lobby to wait to have their name called.  Which would be nice but my name was never called.  What ended up happening was there was a carousel of very furious folks with \"reservations\" that kept going up to the hostess podium once the previous game cleared out.  Being frustrated enough and actually having a hostess come back from the dining room stating that a table was open seemed to be the prerequisite to being seated.  I was told my name was going to get called and I stood for a long time in front of the podium and ultimately sat on the floor till I saw every single angry customer with a reservation complain and get seated as soon as there was a clean table.  I was in no mood to complain in a civil fashion so I figured I would wait till my name was called my reservation and my repeated check ins had to count for something.  It didn't my name was never called.  What did happen was I was asked while I was sitting on the floor what my name was again.  I spelled it out and was asked again.  For a place that had me check in three times out of their flawed process to ask me my name put me over the edge.  I shut down and luckily for me my wife spoke up and spelled out our name.  We were then immediately called once we could verify that we knew our own name and could spell it.  The best part being that they sat us down with the game I had reserved no where in site.  When I asked about it I was initially told they couldn't do anything about the tv's in that area but ultimately I tv above my head where I had to crane my neck was set to the Cardinals game.  It gets one set of service stars better though folks.  There are three areas to sit in.  The nice big game tiered seating which is 100 dollars per person minimum, the standard seating which is 50 per person minimum, and the communal area which is 25 minimum per person.  Not till I left did I figure out I never got my own tv and I saw the seating we should have had if it was the standard 50 per person seating.  I spent 100+ on some decent food but horrible service had I known where I was seated I would had a pretzel and a drink.  Don't go here unless you like to be treated like you are less than nothing when you plan on spending something.  I was seated in the middle of the second quarter and the Cards lost to the Steelers btw."

To get a little area with a private tv and seats, you need to spend at least $25 dollars per person per game. The dollar amount may vary by sporting event being board casted. To get to Lagasse stadium you might either enter through the basement of the Palazzo or enter on Sands and Las Vegas Blvd. The audio for the game is based on which has the most money on it. They have a big screen TV on the sports book area, but tons of TVs all around the facility. \n\nWe were seated next to our fellow Bears fans. Our server Yuri was great. He kept the drink and food coming. WE ordered the Bloody Mary and waiting 10 minutes for the lunch menu to be available because the breakfast food wasn't as appealing. Our server was so much fun and was very attentive. I wish I could remember his name, but it was not your usual Tom, Bob, or John. When lunch was available we ordered some cheese dip with pretzels and hummus. The cheese was so delicious you wanted to drink it up. They didn't really offer and vegetables for the hummus and to get veggies you had to order them on the side. (2.00 extra for small amount of celery).  I wish our server told us about the Bud promotion, but I don't think he knew about it until 10 minutes before the drawing.  It was ok because the authentic jerseys Bud was giving away were Vikings and Giants.  If it was a Bears jersey, I would have ordered a few extra beers to get into that drawing.  We had some more beers, cheered with our fellow Bears fans, and booed the viking fans walking past.  I do have to say.. if you do not have a seat, please don't ask to sit with those who have tables.  Having a table is not free and I am not sure if that one person sitting there adds on to the 25 dollar per person charge.

Don't bother with this place, if you can find it. it's nothing more than a run down sub-basement sports bar with boring chain-like greasy food.\n\nIt should be cool as there are TVs everywhere and the layout is interesting but your first clue that there's a problem is the Home Depot-like carpet squares are coming unglued from the floor.\n\nShame on Lagasse for lending his name to this. He obviously lent nothing to the kitchen. Hope the check was a big one."

The food, to me, was subpar: the only thing I really liked was my crab cocktail. I ordered the shrimp and grits as an entree. The shrimp was not described as being jumbo, but it was. To some people, this might not be a problem, but I'm not a fan; I couldn't even bite through the head. It was also wrapped in bacon that had not been crisped properly AT ALL: it felt like it was still raw in spots. My bread pudding was underdone, and the creme anglaise was salty. At least the drinks were good: I highly recommend the Mulligan. Service was patchy at best; toward the end of the night, we waited 20-30 minutes for water, only to find that we had a container already available, but they could have at least mentioned that. I definitely was not impressed, and I won't be back. Wish we had gone to Delmonico instead, as was the original plan."

We happened to be in the Palazzo and were referred to Lagasse's Stadium.  We entered the massive sports bar and were shocked at how beautiful it was.  Sure, it was very dimly lit for the middle of the afternoon, but the decor oozed sophistication.  This was a place you could picture well-known sport players visiting, when they want to watch a game.  \n\nThere was a light breeze outside, so we decided to grab a table on the patio.  Though the street was somewhat obscured, and it was hard to people-watch, we were loving the lazy rays from the warm sun.  Though we just ordered one round of drinks, we were there long enough to be dazzled by our attentive and friendly waiter.  Plus, my Bloody Mary was ridiculously enjoyable!  It packed the perfect amount of spice, alcohol, and tomato.  It was certainly one of the best versions of the drink that I have ever had.  \n\nI would definitely revisit Lagasse's Stadium on my next trip into town, whether it would be for another beverage, to sample the gourmet bar food courtesy of Emeril Lagasse, or to join in the ruckus during an important sporting event.  This place is a blast...in a glass!"

I have a hard time believing that Emeril himself came up with the menu here, as it's just regular bar food, and nothing special. \n\nThey roped us in with the zillions of ads they had in the Palazzo advertising $5 apps during happy hour and cheap buckets of beer.  Well we were in a hurry to get something quick before the Phantom, so we didn't do the buckets, but asked for a happy hour app menu.  There were like two things to choose from, and it sounded like they were tiny portions.  So, as I'm sure most people end up doing, we just ordered from the regular menu anyway.  We had the bbq pork nachos, which I didn't really enjoy at all.  The bbq sauce was much too sweet and didn't go with the rest of the ingredients.  I would have liked the nachos and pork separately, but I just didn't think they paired very well.\n\nI liked that they had a pool table or two outside, but like I said, I can't comment on the inside.  My guess is the real appeal of this place is watching a game with your buddies, not the food.  I just don't understand why they had to slap Emeril's name on it."

I liked the fact that she was honest.  Plus, the shrimp dish was like $15 and the salad was less expensive.  My husband had some kind of wrap with sweet potato fries.

Chicken BBQ pizza is never a bad choice and the oyster po-boy a fun take on the ususal sandwich.  \n\nDrinks and wine are midrange in price wich means more expensive then the cheap places but not as expensive as the high end bars in sin city.  \n\nIt was really difficult using up the 400 $ on two (but we sure tried) but the nice 135 $ a bottle Napa Valley wine helped some. \n\nService was fast and efficient and as UFC 189 was one of the best events ever we had an awesome time here.  \n\nSo, experience is a 4 star and food 3 star."

As a couple, the seating arrangements can be a bit iffy if not sitting at the actual bar.  We have had great spots where we were comfortable, only to have our location or tv channel changed due to a larger(hence more revenue).  This is a bit frustrating...but there has been a silver lining. \nThis is where our lifesaver...the manager, I believe the name is D'Sean(please forgive me if I'm off a bit!) has stepped in and made things right every time.  This last time we were there for UFC 189.  We arrived to find that things had changed from our last visit..i.e..everything was reservation only.  We hung out at the bar for a while and figured we'd wait it out to see if any of the many reserved spots opened up due to no-shows.  At this point...barely starting the prelims...there were lots of empties.  We saw D'Sean and let him know we wanted a spot if one became available.  He was personable and let us know he'd check things out.  Eventually, they opened up a room in the back, and we and another couple were the first to be seated there.  Hooray for D'Sean!  Give that man a raise...whomever can! Outstanding customer service at it's best.  We had an awesome time with the others who joined us.  Service was great too! Thank you to all.

What we got did not look like any salad I'd ever seen, and no tomatoes.  Spinich, walnuts, blue cheese, and some kind of dried fruit were underneath the best thing I've ever seen on a salad; onion rings.  It looked like vomit, but tasted like heaven.  \n     I had the half roasted chicken, and it was decent.  It looked a bit under-cooked, and later my stomach confirmed that it was.

Finally checking out the place formerly known as just \"The Sportsbook\" which was formerly known as the 40/40 Club. We reserved one of the tables along the outside of the stadium seating. The whole place is impressive... large screen TVs everywhere... oversized comfy couches. Each reserved area has it's own TV, which was great for us because we wanted to watch the Skins-Falcons game, which most people probably didn't care about unless they had money on it. One negative about this place is that the only audio they pipe in is the feed from the game on the main screen. It would be nice if each table had it's own separate audio system since they're somewhat secluded.\n\nThe place is a lot bigger than it looks when you first walk in from inside the Palazzo. If you walk past the tables and stadium seating and down the hall you'll see some video poker machines to the left and some luxury suites/sky boxes, which are even more secluded. They've got their own video games and billiard tables. There's a lower level with tables (mostly 4-tops I think) for folks to eat. Outside they've got more couches, patio seating and billiard tables. The sports book is located at the base of the stadium seating.\n\nThe food was disappointing. It was mainly standard bar food that tasted average at best. They have one breakfast item for people who get there early. It was a tortilla bowl with all kinds of breakfast crap thrown in (eggs, sausage, bacon, etc.). It didn't look appetizing to me but one of my friends ate the whole thing. Their lunch menu is available starting at 10am. We tried the crab cakes, 2 different types of pizza, onion rings, fries, chicken wraps, wings, and cheesecake. The crab cakes had a frozen-food/grocery store quality to them -- shredded bits of crab mixed with lots of filler. And they were shaped exactly like hockey pucks. I was expecting to see the NHL logo on them. Pizzas were average. Wraps were average. Wings were average. Onion rings and fries may have been the best stuff there. The cheesecake wasn't bad either. As other reviews have mentioned, they don't have pitchers of beer. But you can get a bucket of five and the sixth one was free. Their beer selection is fairly limited, but have standard stuff like Corona and some lesser known stuff like Fat Tire (which I love).\n\nPrices are very reasonable. $6-7 for each bottle of beer. Appetizers for around the same price. Entrees ranged from $12- 20+. We were told that there was a $50 min/per person for our area, but after reading some of the other reviews it sounds like others were told it was a $25 minimum. And, as others have stated it's a lot tougher to meet that minimum than you would think because everything is so moderately priced. In the end, we were only charged for what we ordered (not all of us met the $50 min) and the waitress said that they only tell people about the minimums so people won't reserve tables and only order water and one appetizer. The service was decent. The place was packed for all the NFL action, so our waitress was running around and seemed a little overwhelmed.\n\nOverall, it's a great place to catch a game. Especially if it's playing on the main screen. They get high marks for atmosphere but the food needs to improve."

Thats $75 for just one set of games - either the morning games that start at 10am, or the afternoon games that start at 1pm. \n\nThe venue looks great in pictures.  Stadium seating with a dozen or so large TV's as well as a giant screen all playing different NFL games.  Comfy couches and plenty of tables to set your food on.  I was expecting football nirvana...until we were led to a side room with some basic restaurant style seating and a few TV's on the wall.  I might not have minded as much if there were just more TV's in that room.  We had a large wall, with plenty of unused space, but only one TV.  About every two or three tables there was another TV.  The problem is everyone wants to see a different game.  My table got there early and got the waitress to put the Raiders game on.  Two tables over was the Red Zone channel.  Anyone in between was forced to watch one or the other.  I would have loved to see 2-4 TVs side to side and top to bottom.  Plenty of room in there for that and it just might have made this trip worth it.  \n\nHopefully you like the food, because you'll be ordering a lot to cover the $75 minimum.  I will say I did enjoy the food - high end bar type food.  I ordered so much it became a blur, and after a while was just ordering to cover the minimum.  It might have been easier if I was ordering alcohol, but since I was driving back home after the game, that was a no go.  \n\nI might actually come back if I could be guaranteed seating in the main stadium, but I'll probably just catch a game somewhere else.  It's Vegas, there are plenty of options.  \n\ntl;dr - Great for those who can eat a lot, and get to sit in the main stadium.  Just okay for everyone else."

            "review": "Lagasse's Stadium is essentially an upscale sports bar on the strip in Las Vegas.  It is a great place to watch a game, or several games, and they even ask you what game you are wanting to watch when taking your reservation to make sure they put you at a table with a good view of it.  There are TVs everywhere, including one giant big screen in front of the true stadium seating.  \n\nI sampled a couple of their traditional sports bar appetizer offerings - the Bavarian pretzel and chili cheese fries - and enjoyed them both.  Seeing as this is an Emeril Lagasse restaurant, it probably would have been wiser to get a Cajun dish, but I am a sucker for pizza whenever it is on the menu.   \n\nMy spicy sausage and pepperoni pizza at Lagasse's Stadium was okay, and it had pretty good meats and cheese.  However, I found the crust to be too hard along the edges, and nothing stood out as extraordinary about the pizza.  I still enjoyed my meal and view of Indiana University winning the Big Ten title at Lagasse's Stadium, but, based on the reviews from my fellow diners, I would recommend trying one of their Cajun entrees in lieu of the pizza."

Call well in advance of your trip if you want to get a seat. We had a limited options calling two months ahead. \n\nService was great. We had a very nice waitress named Veronica who was great stopping by and several support staff to fill water.  We had a constant stream of buckets filled with beer. \n\nFood was ok. I had a breakfast pizza, tuna poke, and a salad.  The pizza was greasy and I was not a fan of the runny eggs on top of it. Tuna poke was good but dressed a little heavy. \n\nWe were about $400 short of our min and had to buy two bottles of whiskey. We drank too much beer from buckets which I would not recommend if you have to make a min. \n\nBetting was good and pretty quick after a giant line at the sports book died down. I would come back for games but would look at the sofa lounge or the private rooms if they weren't too much more."

(giak!).\nWe got a veggie platter to start, that was ok, but our pizzas were so bad that even my starving man could only have 2 slices! (and believe me, he would eat anything when he is hungry!). Doughy, soggy, tasteless, greasy, I would even say probably undercooked. It was just disgusting!\nWe had a good time because of the experience of watching the game with a bunch of other fans on the big screen so for that I give them 4 stars but the food definitely lowers their rating to 2 stars, so average to 3 stars.\nEmeril's name on this place makes you think it would be great...big disappointment for someone that really loves good food!.\nIf you go here to enjoy some sports, my recommendation would be go to have a nice dinner first and then go to Lagasse's for drinks."

            "review": "We came to grab some drinks after dinner. As a local, I've known about this place for some time and knew what to expect. \n\nFirst let me say, this place is a bit off the beaten path in the casino. We had to use the signs to find the place, which is sort of on a floor by itself. The signs only say Lagasse Stadium, with no indication that this is a bar. It's presumptuous for the promoters to expect patrons to know what this establishment has to offer (read: sports bar). Also, it's an odd location (go down an escalator from the casino floor), which makes me think they're heavy into marketing and possibly catering to the locals. So what, I had to find the place. That's no biggie & no stars lost on that point. Just odd, so it warranted a comment. \n\nSo we get there, and the lady at the front says \"what are you doing here.\"  Umm..we want a drink. So we tell her we want to sit at the bar. Again with the attitude: she says its first come/first serve. To which I say,  aren't all bars?  Anyways, we make our way in and find a spot at the bar. \n\nSo lucky for the front desk lady, the bartender was much friendlier. I mean it was probably average service, but to layup the rude lady, by offering a smile and a beer, she seemed so much better. \n\nAfter grabbing a drink, we decided to look around. There was dining room sitting, I think 4 bars (maybe more?), private rooms, outdoor seating, couches, and of course the stadium seating. There was also a guy in a glass room announcing the basketball game in progress, with legit stats, that was being broadcast through the speaks. This was quite cool! \n\nThere were signs for a private party (not yet in progress), which could explain the rude \"what are you doing here\" crap from the front lady. \n\nHonestly, the place looked really neat & I may be back if in the neighborhood. I don't usually let one thing blackball an establishment forever. But the attitude at the front desk was not cool. Customer service is key, particularly if you're a strip bar, charging strip prices. The reality is there are a lot of other places where I can pay $7 for a beer on the strip without the attitude."

I understand there are dollar thresholds you have to cross for reserved seating during high profile games (didn't apply for the bowl game on the night we visited), but if you're planting yourself someplace to watch a football game, chances are you'll be eating and drinking for a solid 3+ hours, so shouldn't be that hard to meet your quota.  At least it wouldn't be for me!  \n\nWe were seated in the stadium/couch area, and had some of the best seats in the house.  Our seats were chaise lounge style, so we were able to stretch our legs out and watch our game on the big screen.  Comfort, check!  \n\nThere were tons of TVs in this place.  There were several flatscreens surrounding the main projection screen, and then a few other bar areas apart from the main seating area, all of which seemed to have ample TV options.  Game viewing, check!\n\nThey had interesting menu options, but when I'm watching a game I pretty much always want to shovel nachos in my face, and they were more than able to accommodate me in that mission.  Decent food options, check!  \n\nI wasn't too adventurous with my drinks choices here.  We opted for buckets of Corona, with the occasional Patron shot mixed in.  Think we got a good deal on the Coronas, but who could really remember after a couple quarters passed by.  Hey, my team was getting annihilated!  Beer deals, check!\n\nIt was pretty empty when we were there - ours was the late game. But our server was friendly and attentive, and nonjudgmental of my meltdowns each time my team made a horrible play (it was quite frequent on this particular evening).  Good service, check!\n\nI really can't think of a better spot to watch a big game, especially in Vegas.  I am going to dock them a star for having foie gras on the menu.  I hate it anywhere, but is it really necessary to have a foie gras burger at a sports bar?  I don't think so."

They were too costly, for one, but luckily Suz and I were sharing.  And granted, I was slightly queasy after a long night of much dissipation, and a breakfast of two Pacificos and 4 oysters.  But some eager cook had gone \"bam\" one too many times with that beef; it was seasony-salted to oblivion.  Too bad, too, because the steak was very tender and could have been great.\n\nThe chili cheese fries were pretty epic, though.  I'd get those again without reservation or hesitation.  And they serve bottles of Abita Turbo Dog, so that's cool."

Our table was ready downstairs close to the mega 100 foot screen.  \n\nI ordered the Stadium Burger with caramelized onions and applewood smoked bacon.  Upon delivery I barely noticed any onions.  Fortunately they were grilled but well hidden in the center of the burger.  Cooked just right (medium) the burger satisfied my appetite along with the sweet potato fries.  The dipping sauce resembled a sweet mayo flavor.  Perfect complement for the crunchy sweet potato fries.  \n\nTo curb my sweet desires I ordered Emeril's banana cream pie for desert.  Delicious came thru yet again as the banana cream pie filling was thick but not overly sweet.  The whip cream and caramel was marginal and not over-compensating the pie.  I definitely took my time enjoying each bite!\n\nService was great.  No issues at all except for the rowdy Miami Heat fans!  Next year we'll get you!  THUNDER UP!"

There's a $250 minimum which isn't too hard to meet with 4-5 people eating and drinking over the course of a football game. Service was slow and the prices were high (compared to similar food/drink not at a casino hotel). I was underwhelmed by the food; I figured something with Emeril's name on it would really have some amazing food. But, alas, I've had better and more exciting meals at Applebee's.

Both times, we were told that we had to leave before a certain time, as we were seated in areas with reserved spots later in the day; but, what we wanted to watch was ending in time anyway.  In hindsight, it would have been a good idea to call ahead, but it worked out.  \n\nThe main screen is huge, like a movie theater's screen.  There are also several off shooting areas (those had a lounge feel), which made the overall restaurant feel huge.  Food was good, but not particularly memorable either way.   You're coming for the event anyway, and the food is good enough while you watch. \n\nHaving a sports book right there is nice & convenient, but the lines can be long.

It just makes the game even better when you are able to have a CIVILIZE, Trash Talking conversation with all the Gang Green Leprechauns out there. The place has a FUN and LIVELY atmosphere.  \n\nSince we got here a little late, we were unable to sit in the Stadium but luckily enough they had a plush couch on the sideline available in front of a BIG screen TV. SCORE!!! It felt like you were watching the game on your couch with a group of friends.  Since we sat on the sideline, the server did inform us that there is a $25 per person minimum and if you sat in the Stadium there is a $50 minimum per person. Wow, REALLY!!! I guess you are paying for the lounge rental.  Since we all drink like Sailors, the minimum charge was no Problemo! \n\nSo here is what we ordered: \n*Buffalo Chicken Wings - The wings was juicy and drenched in buttery hot sauce. \n*Grilled Chicken Nachos - You can't go wrong with crispy tortillas covered in cheese and pinto beans with Guacamole, Sour Cream and Salsa.\n*Kobe Burger - I was very disappointed with the Kobe burger. I think they need to massage the cow a little bit more. \n\nI had high expectation on the food but it was a HUGE let down. It was just your typical, AVERAGE bar food. \n\nOn a brighter note, the service was phenomenal and they had a full bar with a nice selection of beers on tap. I think Emeril left all his MAGIC on the Food Network.

We were unsure where to watch the game but ended up deciding on this place. \n\nTo avoid the lineup, the hostess suggested that we could watch it by the big screen as long as our bill comes out to be a min of $100. The bf and I agreed. \n\nWe had the buffalo chicken wings! Hands dowwwwn again. De-LISHIOUS! (see picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KPV_FVNWkgmYh1ArVlt6kg?select=0A7ydF2cJXr1XZI_yQhTow).

It's got me saying \"where have you been all of my life!?\" I'm missin' out, yo. \n\nWe had the New Orlean Prawns...Oh-my...soooo juicy and when you bite the prawn, you could hear that outer surface skin snap like it was a pipin' hot smokie that just came off from a grill. So delicious. Just thinking about it is making me salivate. The sauce was Oh-SO-good too. Just superb. \n\nAlso had grilled asparagus and crab cakes. Asparagus was asparagus...nothing spectacular. But the crab cakes were very flavorful. I had to savour the moment by chewing my food very slowly. When I was eating this, the score was already 3-0 Bostons. I was too depressed but I couldn't let the game affect my mood on devouring these crab cakes that just simply melted in my mouth.\n\nFresh Ahi tuna, green onion and avocado marinated in sesame soy sauce on crispy wonton chips with drizzles of wasabi vinaigrette. This was a great choice by the bf? or moi? Anywhoo, it was just superb. The great flavor just danced delicately on my palate and I felt myself in heaven. \n\nOther than the game which was unbearable to watch, I just fell in love with this sports bar and restaurant.

Kind of odd since it is a restaurant, but I guess they want to be considered more of a bar and sports betting area? Anyways we get to the door and we are all asked for our ID's which we then present.

I was expecting a mini sports stadium theme. We get placed in a corner area, but felt it was too tight for the 4 of us so we asked for a table a few feet away. We get seated and I tried to tip the hostess and she refused it?! Maybe a not tip rule? I don't know but I've never seen a hostess not accept a tip for seating in Las Vegas in my 22 years of living here.\nOur waitress who doubles as a bartender took our order and a few of us requested beers. She then asks us for our IDs and I said we just showed our IDs at the front desk just to get in. She says it's her job and how she could be banned from Nevada as a server if she doesn't check ID..... OK we show our IDs again. I asked about draft beer and there is none available at this \"sportsbar\". We also tried to see if a BLT could be kicked up a notch by adding turkey to make it a club sandwhich, but turkey is not available, bam. OK we are talking, watching baseball like we are interested then our food is served. A little bit of this and that and it really is just basic, average, boring bar junk food. No bam, not really Emeril Energy. I guess Emeril just sold his name, because the food just can't be his creations. My shrimp salad sandwich was bland, a Kobe burger was nothing special, BLT is a blt and my wife's French dip was about as special as a $1.99 ARBY's French dip if not worse. EMERIL are you out there?

We stayed for several hours to watch the morning and afternoon games. The drinks were even pricier than I had anticipated but were very strong so they did their job. We had pork nachos that were fantastic and a crab dip that was ok. We were shocked to see our bill was almost $200...we should have gotten the $100 minimum seating instead! Great place for a group of friends to go for sporting events. We will definitely stop by again this weekend for the NBA playoffs!"

It's something that I didn't expect when going into this place which made me love it even more. Also the food was so good. The wings and burgers were fabulous. And even their fries were amazing. For a casual yet classy kinda sporty spot with yummy food this will always be my go to spot for that type of food and decor. Everyone was friendly and the set up and food was great. That's all I ever ask for when it comes to a restaurant."

            "review": "After hanging out here for two days straight, I think it's about time I update my previous review.\n\nNow, I'm not a fan of American football, but there's something about the atmosphere of Lagasse's Stadium that makes watching it enjoyable for me, and I think it's mainly due to the diners who come in cheering for their favorite teams. It's the spot to head down to if you want to watch a sporting event.  If you plan on doing this, I'd suggest making reservations in advance because this place will be packed to the max. \n\nRESTAURANT\nI've sat and dined in both the stadium seating areas and the \"living room\" type of booths a few times, but I prefer the former because the the latter can get a little too \"cozy\" for you and your group. Depending on which booth you get, there are some that have more light than others. I've been in both and I can say the one with less lighting reminds me of eating in a living room with the lights off, but maybe that's the point? Furthermore, sitting in these booths can make you feel like you're separated from all the action that's taking place in the stadium seating area. \n\nIt's not an easy feat to eat your meal at both booths and stadium seating areas, unless you request to be seated at a regular table or decide to share food with your group, because food and beverages are placed on coffee tables. I had to place my plate of food on my lap or on some vacant spot on the couch. \n\nFOOD AND DRINKS\n+Trimbach Riesling: One of the worst Rieslings I've ever drank.\n\n+Coffee: The coffee I ordered was warm, not hot.\n\n+Tea: The water for the tea was hotter than the coffee. I've ordered hot tea on each day I was there. Sometimes you'll receive three packets of different flavors of tea, and other times it'll be four. Sometimes you'll receive wedges of lemon, but the next time you might not receive any.\n\n+ Fish and Chips: Three battered and fried fish accompanied with steak fries, tartar sauce, vinegar, and coleslaw. The fish was crunchy and not too greasy, but I didn't like the peppered coleslaw. In regards to the presentation, I didn't think it was functional because the dish was served in a black metal basket. The basket doesn't have a solid bottom, so any wet foods and sauces will leak through. I had to place my condiments on a separate plate and place napkins underneath the basket.\n\n+Tuna Poke Chips: Four round fried wonton chips topped with seaweed salad, poke, and mustard. This reminds me of a sad version of Grand Lux's Asian Nachos. The poke wasn't the best tasting, and the plain mustard was unsuitable. Asian ingredients + French's mustard = not a good combination. Cool concept for an appetizer, but it was poorly executed. \n\n+Banana Cream Pie: This is my favorite dessert that I've tried at Lagasse's. The pie is creamy and it isn't too sweet, but the caramel sauce that was drizzled around the pie ruined it because it had an odd flavor that didn't taste like caramel --  now I'm questioning what I ate...\n\nSERVICE\nWe had different waitresses for both days and both did a good job taking care of us. On the first day I went, the restaurant appeared under staffed. I noticed our waitress was in charge of not only taking our orders but serving our food and picking up empty plates. On the second day everything appeared to be running smoother than the previous day, because more staff was on hand to assist the waiters and waitresses. \n\nOVERALL\nAfter all the food I've tried, I can still say that it's mediocre and overpriced. Service can be decent at times, but it's in need of some fine tuning. Other than those things that I've mentioned, I'd recommend coming here if you want to experience watching a sporting event differently than you would at a regular bar; it's why I keep returning, and it's the reason why I'm giving Lagasse's Stadium an extra star."

It sounded like such a great deal - $39 for 2 entrees, 2 apps and 2 beers (regularly $76) and you get to watch a game on top of it.  Well, I could not have been more wrong! I tried twice to make reservations to watch football here.  Both times I was told that I would be charged an additional $50 in order to get seating where I could view a game.  What? I bought this deal since it was advertised as being able to come watch a game and enjoy dinner.  The choice given to me was to sit on the patio with no televsion access if I was going to be able to use the deal with Travelzoo.  Their explanation has been \"mangement  reserves all rights\".  I guess they do have the right to use false advertisement and not honor the deals that they have offered to locals."

The main part when you walk in offers lounge type stadium seating that faces a floor to ceiling wall of screens. The group I was with sat in a semi private area that had its own TV & faces the large wall of screens. We were able to change the game that was on the TV in our area. The service was good. I'm not sure if we had the minimum thing mentioned in other reviews as I was met the group there. Food wise u had the grilled ham and cheese sammich with truffle parmesan fries. It was sooooo good. The sammich did seem a little too salty so I pulled off some of the ham. Still just as good with only ham. \nDuring my 10 day stay in Vegas I was hoping to go back but that didn't happen.

My good friend and Vegas native raved about how incredible Lagasse's is and how I would love it. Being a Vegas regular, I was more than down to check out Emeri's spot.\n\nAs we made our way down to the Palazzo from the Bellagio, the trek took a good 25 minutes and walking is your only option in Vegas. We spend another 20 minutes actually getting to the restaurant from within the resort. We pass by the Exotic Car Collection and finally reach the doors and its bustling, loud, packed and we're greeted by a duo of hot hostess.\n\n\"We're sorry but we are closed for a private World Cup party.\"\n\nI was pissed! I didn't care if Andre Agassi and David Beckham were doing body shots off each other, I just walked from the Bellagio to the Palazzo. It wasn't meant to be and it wasn't meant to be a second time, but I finally made it in like a Harvard Frat from \"The Social Network\".\n\nThe business is beyond impressive and resembles a club, which it was at one point (Jay-Z's 40/40 Club).  The lounge gives you an ultra VIP experience without breaking your bank account.  Our hostess tried seating us at a table away from the stadium seating, but we requested to be front and center and were accommodated\n\nA waitress came over and gave us menus and gave us a rundown on their specials.  Since it was only myself and my friend, we settled on a bucket of Coronas and an appetizer.  We ordered the Grilled Chicken Nachos, which were reasonably priced at $14.  The vibe, plethora of tv screens, and eye candy were definitely hitting the spot as we killed a bucked of Mexican beer with lime.  The nachos came out and they were nicely presented.  The crispy tortilla chips were smothered with cheese and pinto beans, and layered with guacamole, sour cream, and their house salsa.  The pallet of nacho flavors hit the spot and were all washed down with an ice cold Corona.\n\nAfter soaking in a bucket of beers and a large appetizer, I was a happy customer.  I wasn't too focused on the games on the screens, but had it been baseball season or my hometown SF Giants winning the series, it would be heaven on earth.  The bill came and was in the $50 range not including tip.  A good value for six imported beers, an appetizer, and some lounge time.  I'll be back for sure, I'll just call in advance and make sure they're open and no private parties are being hosted."

I had read about this place and thought we should give it a shot. I'm so glad we did. This would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the young lady at the hostess stand. When we arrived she asked If there was a certain game we wanted to watch. We told her and she said she had a table for us but there was a $25 per person minimum to sit at a table. I have no issues with that at all. It's Vegas you can't expect to sit anywhere without paying something. We really only wanted an appetizer and a drink. Neither of us wanted alcohol at that point so I knew we wouldn't be spending $25 per person. What was disappointing is her attitude toward us when we said we really just wanted and appetizer and were not able stay long enough to warrant the minimum price for a table. She rolled her eyes at us and said well then you have to sit at the bar where it's first come first served. I realize that she didn't want to give us the time of day because she wouldn't be making tips on us, but come on. At least smile and show us the way to the bar instead of rolling your eyes like we were losers for not wanting a table. So we ate at the bar and the service was excellent there. The bartenders were very nice. Now to the food. Wow we ordered the green chili pork nachos!!!! These were so good. My husband is very picky and he could not believe how awesome these were. This pile of goodness could EASILY feed 4-6 people. We didn't even make a dent in it. We were shocked at how every single chip was loaded with toppings. You have to try these. Just be warned, if you plan on eating dinner somewhere else, you won't be able to eat. We skipped our dinner plans because we were so stuffed. The concept of this place is pretty neat. If you have few people and want to catch a game this looks like the perfect place to do it. Each couch has their own tv, pretty cool. They just need to work on who they have at the hostess stand. First impressions are important. If I wasn't so tired of walking and hungry, I would have walked out based on my first encounter with the rude staff. So happy I stayed and chose the nachos!"

This isn't a sports book and the minimum is in place partially to help make the distinction. \n\n- Check in when you arrive. The hostesses need to be able to assign you a location based on reservations.  If there is a big game there may not be standing room at one of the bars.  You may have to get in where you fit in. Remember, even the patio seats are reserved.\n\n- Watch any of Emeril's shows. Yes, he is a brilliant chef and can make anything fancy. Look at his personality.  This is a guy who can make sports oriented or blue-collar oriented food both fancy and delicious.  With that said, focus on the decadent twist on burgers and fries! Don't come here for salad!!!

Probably equal to three smaller pretzels elsewhere. I was the perfect appetizer.\nThis is a great place to watch the game I just suggest reserving seats before you come."

Waited in line twenty minutes to get in, only to be told if I wanted a nice couch, it would be $150.00 for me, and $75 if I wanted a stool.  The only \"free\" place to sit was at one of the three bars.  Have plenty of money but HATE being charged to sit (when did this bulls*** concept start anyway?).  I will drink, I will eat, but do not charge me to sit or you've lost me.  First two bars were full so had to go to the back bar which is like falloujah.  Terrible television set up and worst, when I asked why they had two of the three large screen on the same game, I was told the guys downstairs(who presumably paid more) get to choose what is on the screen on football Sunday.  Ridiculous!\n\nOrdered coffee which was good, and the oysters which for $18, were six of the smallest oysters I've ever seen(baby oysters?).   Emeril, you should be ashamed of yourself, calling yourself a chef and allowing this type of wretched food to be served.  Can't be sure of the rest of the menu but what I had made me not want to try the saltine crackers.  Bartender was cute and competent, otherwise I'm going to a real sports book."

First visit we both had the Kobe burgers, which are normally delicious...except this time.  They both were extremely bland, and tasted like there wasn't any seasoning on the burger.  The fries were ok, and the service was mediocre at best, our food sat on the counter for literally 5 minutes before the server brought them around.  I ordered a second beer upon arrival of the food, it never came.  \nThe second time, was the difference between night and day.  This time fantastic service, I ordered the french dip with onion rings and my wife had the BLT.  Both selections were fantastic, and flavorful.  All and all, I would say we would go  back, after the groupon on both occasions our bill for two meals and a drink were in between $6-8( the groupon cost $15), so out the door it was about $21-23, plus a tip.  Any time you can get out the door in vegas for that cheap, its a good thing."

We were a bit delayed but got seated in about 10 minutes.  After being seated, one of the managers (or servers?) came by and asked if we had reservations.  We said yes and told him that we checked in at the front and a girl brought us to the table.  He left and said he had to go confirm (like we were lying...).  A girl came back and asked the same thing; poor communication.  I get that the place is busy for Sunday football but there were a lot of staff walking around so organizing people into their seats shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAfter all this was sorted out, we waited almost another 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by the wait staff to put our order in.  We were told that we had to spend $600 to have the booth ($100/person); an absurd amount of food and beverages to consume in 3.5 hours.  The only way this could happen is to order all the most expensive things on the menu and drink a lot of top shelf liquor.  Are they suggesting we binge drink?  Because that's the only way we can consume that dollar amount.  We had a late night and just wanted to enjoy some good football, food and a couple beers.  \n\nWe ordered a few pizzas, some soft pretzels, wings and banana cream pie.  The pizza wasn't that great and the wings were fatty - not crispy.  The only highlight was the banana cream pie - best I have ever had but not worth the ridiculous amount we paid.  \n\nLet it be known that our $600 booth had ONE television that we couldn't even control ourselves.  We had to flag down a server to change it for us.  The view of the big screen was obstructed by the TV beside us.  For that money, we could have rented a cabana poolside, had our own TV to control, get much better views and the ability to go swimming.\n\nWe were then told we had to be gone by 5pm.  Factoring in about a 30 minute delay in getting our order in, we now had 3 hours to consume $600 worth of food and drink.  Impossible!  I believe the minimum order amount removes a lot of motivation from the wait staff.  We ended up not spending $75 and had tons of wasted food and drinks.  Very disappointing.\n\nAll in all, this was a terrible experience.  This is a poor concept compounded by mediocre food and huge minimums. A fail on so many levels - Emeril should be removing his name from this place, immediately."

Typical bar food so nothing outstanding. Ordered chicken nachos and the bbq shrimp to start. Can't really go wrong with nachos. The shrimp were ok but overpriced. You're paying for the atmosphere here. Entrees ordered were the free range chicken sandwich, fish and chips, buttermilk fried chicken, buffalo pizza and prime rib sandwich. Can't rave about any of these. If you want to be safe, order the pizza. The truffle fries were pretty good but the prime rib sandwich is cooked well done so not as flavorful. And nothing special about any of the entrees we tried. This is probably a great place to come when you've already been drinking...that's when anything tastes good and you just want a good atmosphere while watching games."

Huge TV, couches, and beforehand they were going to have a round-table discussion with some former and current NFL players (Joey Porter, AJ Feeley, etc).  Sound perfect, right?\n\nWrong. Everything was good up until about pick #20 and they were well on their way to a 4 star rating.  Food was OK, service was good. we were enjoying ourselves.  Then the Lakers-Thunder game started and they switched over the big screen and the sound to basketball.  Apparently, the sportsbook controls what the TVs show and we were told that they wanted something you could bet on to be on the big screen.  So basically you have a room full of people who came to watch the draft now missing the end of it and forced to watch the first quarter of a boring first round Game 3.  Seriously Lagasse, why advertise a \"NFL Draft Viewing Party\" and then turn it off three quarters of the way through?  I didnt come here to watch it on a tiny TV with no sound.  Not cool."

Forget about getting a table for high profile games ... and getting a table on a Saturday or Sunday during football season ain't gonna happen!  Luckily we flew in to Vegas around 4:00 on a Thursday, so we were basically grabbing dinner since we were still on east coast time.  The only action going on was a divisional playoff baseball game, so it wasn't too crowded.  They have stadium seating (hence the name of the restaurant), so almost impossible for anyone to be in your way while watching the multiple big screens on the wall.  That didn't affect us anyway, as we sat on leather couches/benches in a lounge area that had its own personal television.  The only downside was that they supposedly accommodate 6 to 8 people, but give you a small slender table meant to hold food for about 3 people.  This was not acceptable considering we had drinks, a couple appetizers, silverware, and eventually the entrees.  One other thing to mention about this place ... alongside the big screens were current betting odds, which was kinda cool.  \n\nService was \"mehhh\" ... they weren't very attentive to refills, requesting extra napkins, extra ketchup, etc.  As for the meal, not a great selection of beers, but they did have a few \"beer bucket\" specials.  The reason for three (3) stars instead of two (2) is striclty based on the pretzel and beer cheese ... yum.  My entree (pastrami sandwich) and side of onion rings were rather average ... good, but average.\n\nMy Quick and Dirty review:\n\nAtmosphere - Pretty cool (other than the tiny tables used in the lounge area seating)\nService - Poor\nFood - Average (except pretzel & beer cheese, which was exquisite)\n\nSummary - Good spot if you want to keep track of 4+ sporting events, but I enjoyed the Public House more.  They are a short walk down towards the Venetian ... better menu, better drink selection, and more comfy seating. Fewer TVs, but if you grab a seat at the bar (or lounge area), it's easy to settle in."

            "review": "So I signed up on this JUST to write a review on this place. Not a good thing...obviously. I was there on Sunday Jan 1st to see the NY/Dallas game. First off the place seemed legit, its what you would expect to see from a famous chef. However the service and food made the experience just awful. KEEP IN MIND that  I have been in the service industry for 7 years, mainly behind a bar, so I tend to be more forgiving towards people if they seem busy and can't get to me right away. I'm actually QUITE lenient towards servers and bartenders and tip abundantly because I know how its like to be slammed and you can only do so much. Oh i just ran across town to find you extra ketchup but when I get back to your table and you request more ranch now...ugh. I feel their pain...seriously. BACK TO LAGASSE'S! We got seated right away the hostess was pleasant...did her job end of story. Our table was right near the service station/bar so seeing that it was busy I figured getting a refill wouldn't be THAT hard cause we were so close. WRONG. Ok fine, I'm a prick sometimes but I didn't wanna come off as an A-HOLE by serving myself. So we waited...and waited. There was four of us seated at a 4 person table with only 2 table settings which most often any decent server would notice and bring more without request. WRONG. Ok fine you're busy, but even when the food comes out you don't even bother to notice? wow. So we ordered a few items. NOW THIS IS FUNNY! My sister and friend ordered a BBQ chicken pizza with a side of sweet potato fries. MY wife ordered some wings with a side of  regular fries. I ordered chicken nachos but I wanted sour cream, guac, and pico on the side. I know I'm a little picky but I only do these things so the people in my party can pick and choose if they want these toppings or not. SHE RESPONDS, ok but we are very busy so it's not guaranteed that's what you're going to get.....(WHO DOES THAT?!!!) At my bar we have some shitty servers but none of them would EVER say that. I RESPOND...well then never mind and I'm kind of laughing because I can't believe she just told me that. She goes well I will just say don't put that stuff on. Okay fine I agree. I'm just kind of over looking at this crap menu. So the food comes looks good...until I see these nachos. I wish I took a picture there was the hugest mound of chips you have ever seen in your life with splatters of nacho cheese here and there and the tiniest square shaped pieces of chicken sprinkled on top. Are you serious? Where was everything else? The beans...the meat. AND worst of all EVERYTHING...the chicken cheese and nachos was very cold. Like they forgot to heat it up. Disgusting I sent it back...in a nice way too I didn't give a a bitchy tone or raise my voice...it's not like the server made the food. But then she takes it and leaves. Doesn't say sorry (proper etiquette) and asks if I want something else instead. Ok I think to myself...I'll just eat some of this BBQ chicken pizza...waaaay better at CPK but whatever it will do. So I tried one of my wife's wings...decent but it had a unpleasant after taste. Kind of like a medicine taste...it was strange. I was over this place and the the game sucked so I just needed my check. So since the server  wouldn't dare come near our table I had to ask someone else for it.  I put my AMEX in made sure I didn't pay for those terrible nachos and sent the check to her. She brings it back thanks me and leaves. I open the check book and my credit card is not in there. Hmmm ok, I know I gave it to you because I have these credit card receipt papers to sign...and oh I'm not an idiot. We as a group flag her down because if only one of us tried it would have never happened. She comes and asks me if its in the book and I say um no. She rechecks the book like if I didn't do it and goes to her station to look for it. I'm kind of pissed but laughing at the situation because I really can't believe all I've dealt with. Good thing my wife noticed my credit card near the trashcan on the floor because our server acted like she didn't care. She didn't even apologize for losing it like that. So THANK YOU WIFE for finding it. and to that server I have your name but I won't put you on blast. I think you're in the wrong business. I'll never come here again and I will do everything in my power to steer people away. JUST AWFUL!"

This is aside from the young girls walking around in stripper heels and team jersey dresses, passing out schwag.  \n\nWe \"hung out\" with two of the servers here, who were super cool.  If you don't have a reservation, get there early (and I mean EARLY) on game days so that you can sit at the bar if you don't want to have to deal with the food/bev min.  The reason why we were hanging out with the two cool server chicks was because at their prep station was the only place that we could actually eat.  Um, while standing, by the way.\n\nWe're already planning our annual March Madness trek to include stadium seats."

            "review": "The IDEA of this place is great.   The EXECUTION of it is awful, pure and simple.  The  only good TV is the one big-screen in the middle.   All the others are too small to see unless you're sitting in the front row of the main stadium.  The fonts on the betting boards are unreadable.  And making a bet is difficult because the place goes long periods with NOBODY even there taking bets.   One guy working and he takes his break and all bettors are simply out of luck.   This place COULD BE the best sports book in Vegas but it falls miserably short."

            "review": "I was looking for a suitable venue to watch the IU-Georgia basketball game with my family.  Lagasse's Stadium seemed to fit the bill.  A big name chef lending his name to a sports bar/sports book in the Palazzo...what could be better?  Lagasse's Stadium is a huge, multi-level sports bar cum sports book with HD large screen flat-panels dispersed liberally around the establishment.  It offers a full service bar and menu with the usual bar food suspects, presumably with the Emeril \"bam!\"   Lagasse's Stadium has plenty of table seating as well as lounge seating with a personal HD flat-panel for your area.  We elected to sit in a lounge for our semi-private viewing of the game. \n\nAs a venue to watch your game goes, Lagasse's Stadium is first-rate.  Sadly, where it falls way short is the one place you'd think it would be nailed down tight, the food.  We started off on a good foot with the Tuna Poke Chips appetizer ($15).  The diced Ahi tuna and avocado were fresh tossed in a ponzu vinaigrette and served atop crispy wonton chips which were drizzled with a spicy Chinese mustard.  It came with a small wakame salad on the side.  The app was flavorful without being overdressed with the vinaigrette.  The only negative was the $15 price for the amount received.  However, after our app, the wheels fell off of the chuck wagon.  My dad and I ordered Oyster Po Boy ($16) sandwiches.  Both of our po boys came with what should've been four large-sized, fried oysters on New Orleans-style French Bread with lettuce, tomato and Creole mayonnaise.  Sadly, our oysters were deep-fried into submission leaving only a slightly burnt flavored batter and sad, desiccated oysters within.  I've been to New Orleans.  I know Emeril has been there, too.  No way would he ever mistake these poorly executed excuses for authentic Po Boys.  Lagasse's Stadium delivered something that was practically worthless at twice the price of what a po boy could be found in New Orleans.  My mom ordered the Fish and Chips ($15).  Yet again, the kitchen failed to properly execute the dish.  The beer-battered cod was nicely fried and not too greasy, but the fried fish was way over salted to the point of being inedible.  Not even alcohol could overcome the food fail since Lagasse's Stadium's beer and spirits selection was entirely lackluster.  If I'm going to pay a premium price for a drink to wash down the overpriced, poorly executed food, then you should have something premium on your drink menu.  At least our server was personable, attentive, but not intrusive.  The service and the fact that IU beat Georgia were about the only positives of our visit. \n\nEmeril, if you're going to lend your well-respected name in the culinary world to any establishment, even if it's only a sports bar on steroids, then you should make sure the bar food that they serve meets your same minimum standards that you'd require at Delmonico, Table 10, or your eponymous Emeril's Fish House.  If I were a judge on Top Chef like you, and you served this food to me, I would tell you to pack your knives and go."

I had their Bloody Mary which is by far one of the best I have had.  Pairing it with some pretzels was even that much more exciting, one of the keys to Winning as Charlie Sheen would put it is that Lagasse's should be renamed to a TV everywhere you look Stadium because there are hundreds!"

            "review": "This place is just such a rip off!   75 dollar minimum for ONE GAME.   If you stay for a second game it's an additional 75 dollars...  I was with a party of 4 so let's do the math.  That would be 600 dollars to watch football.  Absurd.  By the end of our meal where we were shoving as much beer and overpriced shots down our throats, we still didn't reach the minimum so we had to order a bunch of water bottles, another round of drinks to go, that we didn't even want!    The pictures online are very generous too.  You walk in and it's very unorganized, we had paid for a couch where they tried putting us in a section with one television (we are huge football fans and enjoy watching multiple games).    And on top of everything else, the food was mediocre at best.   It's typical bar food, pizza was good, lobster grilled cheese was inedible in my opinion.  This was one place I was truly looking forward to on our trip to Vegas, but must say it was the most disappointing and such an outrageous waste of money!   We ended up across the street a Senor Frogs for the next game and had an equally great time for 1/3 of the price.  Trust me, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"

Huge plasma tv's all around and nice comfortable seating in a stadium seating set-up.\n\nThe food isn't great. I had the Grilled Avocado Chicken Wrap. It was dry and chicken was kind of tough. No one else in my party really like their food either.\n\nAlso, it is sub below zero inside. My sister-in-law and I were freezing! The hostess was nice and actually brought us a blanket. Yes, a blanket, inside a sports bar/restaurant.\n\nOverall, the ambiance is very nice but don't come here if you're (a) you're starving (as I was); or (b) looking for good food. More for beer (strip prices) and games."
