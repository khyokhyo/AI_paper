            "review": "Came here for a late lunch before work with my boyfriend after hearing all about it from friends. \n\nI love the overall atmosphere/decor of Park. It's dimly lit and wall-to-wall with kitschy paintings & taxidermy. Their menus reflect their style too, with above-average bar food & cocktails called things like \"Garbage\" and \"the Unicorn.\"\n\nIt was unbearably hot outside, so everyone was seated right inside, by the bar. Service was quick & friendly and our orders came out fast as well. The food, however, was pretty underwhelming for the prices they were charging. Someone had recommended the \"Garbage\" fries to me, so I ordered them... and meh, NOT what I expected for $13. Mind you, an actual entree sandwich cost just a dollar more...\n\nOther than that, it was a good experience. I wouldn't mind coming back for their Happy Hour sometime."

The sandwich was huge & delicious.  The side salad was an excellent mix of greens (not just iceberg) and other veggies.\n- They have Tito's vodka so had a double of that.\n- Will definitely be back."

            "review": "...Yeah i'm just not impressed. Sure the place is artsy in a new young people's hipster vibe everyone seems to find...aesthetically pleasing...\n\nWhen it comes down to it the food is overpriced for the portion sizes and there's little to nothing special about it that hasnt been done before...at a third the price....for double the size. \n\nPresentation is second to none as well. If you're ordering a burger, or in my case the chicken wrap, what you'll get is your wrap on a tray with side of choice and the smallest disposable ramekin of i guess honey mustard. \n\nThe drink menu could use some revision...pricing for one. A wipe down with some disinfectant spray for others.\n\nYeah not impressed. With all the other options on fremont street offering the same drinks for a fraction of the price...unlike you find everything pleasing i wouldnt recommend. \n\nYelp 100 - 033 of 100"

Nothing special but we were not here to chit chat. Brought beer, brought food, brought check. We saw her three times. \n\nThe people watching aspect has me hooked :)))) if it was not sooo chilly and windy tonight we would have stayed for another drink! \n\nHubby ordered the veggie sliders and sweet potato tots. Yum! The pickles on them...ugh I could eat a million. Nothing dry about these burgers. Moist and tasteful. They came with a side of some kind of homemade honey mustard. Tots were too sweet for me but they were yum.\n\nI ordered the veggie pita wrap. Nothing wrap about it. It's a soft, warm stuffed pita. Inside it had eggplant, yellow squash, a tiny bit of smooth spread feta, lettuce and tomato. It comes with crispy hand it fries. Crispy! Ugh I love crispy fries! I don't like catsup but I decided to try it anyway...HELLO?!? It has siracha in it!!!!! Yum I'm sold and will never be the same! \n\nSee my pics for the beauty!\n\nI want to go back to visit the inside, lol we did not even walk in the place!\n\nGreat job Park! Put my name on that table! I want to people watch there everyday! \n\nPerfection!"

            "review": "The name says it all. It amazing too think the creativity people can come up with in the  restaurant business. Think that Park on Fremont literally empty parking lot before this transformation too cool little pub in the ever growing downtown scene. One that more more little cool bars and restaurants really DIGGING the vibe. I think Park on Fremont is another solid addition. \n\nI came with fellow yelpers Mel C, Terri R, Alicia R, Toni R, and Merrick. One thing hopefully they do is get some kind of signage on the exterior because if not for yelp (looked at all of yelpers helpful pics) walked right pass it. It located right next too Radio City Pizza. Some in ways its different without sign and peeks one interest see what on the inside. We never sat on the inside but enjoyed the patio and the amazing weather that night. The patio not that big but just great spot not only for people watching, just kicking back with friends, and not too loud they do play music over the speakers. (in general hear music coming from other bars or even freemont street experience) Still can carry conversations with friends without shouting too one another. They even have beer garden but never venture check it out next tip will. The menu comes too the food not that big but they do offer quite few different beers for such small bar. Although seems that night for some of our party it more like okay out of that too. \n\nIt was only the second night they open too the public so hiccups or just working things out are too be expected. I am not going too be harsh comes too the service. Just felt it was good service even with some hiccups they did great job of taking care of us. Park on Fremont really nice compare too some of the other bars in downtown the bar offers food! It not that big (by the way no Grilled Cheese; it caught my attention for not) but few things is solid options. I decided too have the Hammer Chicken. It not what I expected but suppose in thought Hammer (pounded the chicken thin) not so much sandwich but light chicken salad. Good. The mixed organic greens with balsamic vinegar with blue cheese, toasted walnut or candied walnuts, combine with the chicken went perfect with my Dr Brown orange soda. Everyone else ordered something different but everything looked great. Fan of the wooden utensils and plates. It different goes with the whole flow of the restaurant. For me it does.\n\nOne more feature about the patio with the white picket fences goes around. Fan. It feels like out in midwest kicking back on front porch on great weather day. Hanging out with great company. Great company pleasure of first trip too Park on Fremont and sure not be my last!!!"

            "review": "A co-worker and I had planned on going to their Taco Tuesday during lunchtime (12:30-1:30pm). We thought it would be super busy so we reserved a table. We got there and the reservation was really not necessary at all since there was plenty of seating available . We got there and found out Taco Tuesday didn't start until 3pm. Bummer! We ended up staying since the place had great reviews and really wanted to give the place a try. The pictures posted on Yelp and the other reviews greatly helped to choose from the menu. Ended up choosing the garbage fries and buffalo wings to share. The garbage fries are amazing!!! I am not a fan of eggs and they were kind enough to allow me to order without it. Next time it will definitely be 5 stars once I try the drinks."

            "review": "I had passed many times by this place but never went in. But this time we came in for lunch while walking around trying to decide where to eat. It has such a trendy vibe inside, full bar, and small dining area. But if you go outside, the feel of the vibe completly changes. Its more of a romantic backyard setting with umbrellas and if you peek over the wall by the fire place, there even  a small hangout area with a teeter totter.\n\nThe food was great. Huge portions too. I had ordered the chicken fingers from the appetizer section and it had about 6 fingers with french fries, that itself had me full. Usually you can choose what sauce you want it tossed in, but i asked for the buffalo on the side, and it also came with a side of ranch and ketchup. My friend ordered a burger which was massive and delicious. I wouldn't of been able to finish it.\n\nBut my favorite part of all was their signature mules. The one i ordered had berries in it."

            "review": "My first visit was a Yelp-sponsored event, so you'd have to refer to that review about my experience. Long review short, it was great! I love the outdoor patio (\"The Backyard\"), the service was fantastic, and the bar food was delicious. Memorable moments: Mac & Cheese Balls, Chicken Bar Bites, and The Unicorn (cocktail). \n\nLast night, a couple of us stopped by after an event for a quick snack and drinks. I really could've done a meal, but Park on Fremont is really more of a drinking spot with bar food to nibble while hanging out. NBD. I can always eat fries and fortunately, they serve up some delicious fries here. Garbage Fries ($8) are made with their housemade fries, melted cheddar and provolone cheeses, bacon, fresh jalape\u00f1o, green onion, tomato, chipotle pepper, avocado, and a fried egg. It's so bad, but it's so good. I would absolutely order this again! I would love to try their housemade fries plain as well - not on the menu, but I'm sure they'd serve it.\n\nWe had fabulous service once again. He was very cool and checked on us appropriately. Also, he split our checks (there were three of us) without us having to ask! What a brilliant man!\n\nYou definitely want to hang out in The Backyard when you're here, especially now as the weather is cool at night. Don't forget to visit the seesaw in the back!"

            "review": "I have been to Park several times, and my experience is always similar. First the good stuff. I've never had a bad meal here, and the cocktails are delicious. My favorite cocktail is the Pillow Talk, which is a light and refreshing vodka drink. The food ranges from classic bar food to yummy salads, so no matter what kind of mood you're in, they have something for your tastes. The ambiance is very cool. This place was definitely designed by hipsters--it's quirky and fun. I'm also a huge sucker for a nice, outdoor space, and Park's patio is adorable, although it is very close to a sewer, so you will frequently get whiffs of an unpleasant smell. \n\nOk, now the reason for only two stars. Despite the food, cocktails, and decor, the service is abysmal. I never go here if I need to be quick because I know that unless I'm the only party in the restaurant, I'm not getting out of here in under an hour. The servers are dismissive and nonresponsive, and I still would've given it three stars, but the last time I was there the service was so bad that it's brought me to Yelp. \n\nWe had a large group, and the first thing that happens when we are seated is our server spills an entire glass of ice water down the back of a member of our party. Instead of apologizing he throws a towel at her and runs away. He never returns to clean up. My friend goes to the bathroom to dry off, and I went to speak with the manager because I just didn't like the way it was handled (no apology, not cleaning up the spill, just handing her a towel and disappearing). The bartenders even told me the waiter ran away and was hiding over it. This should NOT have been this big of a deal. \n\nSo I spoke with the manager, and everything was fine, and she came over to our table when my friend returned and offered to comp my friend's meal and the party's first round of drinks. She also had a conversation with my friend separately where she stated this. However, when the bill came, she decided what was \"fair\" would be to only comp my friend's meal \"because she was the only one that had water spilled on her.\" She then claimed she never told us she would comp a round of drinks for the table despite 5 of us hearing her say it. Additionally, despite the immediate error, the service did not improve. We never saw our waiter after he brought our food.\n\nAgain, none of this would have been this big of a deal had he just apologized and helped clean up, if the manager had not stated she would comp drinks for us and then change her mind, and if we had just gotten some acknowledgment during our meal. I hate being a pain in the ass, but the way they handled themselves made me upset."

Ordered 3 waters for the table so we would have water when we arrived. Waitress brought 1 water. We arrived and waited a good 7-8 minutes for the server to come take our drink/food order. Drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive (not kidding). I hate, hate, hate waiting on service especially when the server doesn't acknowledge the wait. I was very ready to walk off but was looking forward to trying the food and my options were limited at that point with the amount of time I had before I had to go to work.\n\nOrdered the fried chicken and waffle sandwich... it was really good. Both were cooked just the way I like it and I would absolutely order again. Sweet potato tots were as good as expected... I find I never really can complain about anything sweet potato.\n\nBlue Moon in a can.... didn't offer me a glass or an orange slice. Defeats the purpose of a blue moon to me.\n\nHorrible service... seemed like they had one server for about 10 tables. It was not a Tuesday afternoon... it was a Saturday night!!! Pretty sure there were more girls at the host stand then they had serving.\n\nDecor is cool and outside seating is a huge plus. Love people watching downtown!"

I really like that you can order a salad as a side option, and it was really good. (Greens, blue cheese, tomatoes, I think & balsamic vinegar) My friend ordered the steak salad and raved about it, although she was still a little hungry later on. \n\nWe stayed after to have a drink at the bar. I love that you can sit at the bar and still be outside, another excellent people watching spot. Double, tall drinks seem to be the way to go. Bartender was cute and genuinely friendly. They also have pull tab wine containers. I didn't try it, but my friend seemed to like them.

The happy hour menu is always great too! \n\nMy boyfriend and I shared the chicken bar bites, Mac n cheese balls and fried pickles. The chicken bar bites were by far the best. They came with a side of fries which were absolutely delicious with the side of spicy ketchup. The mac n cheese bites were good, but the BF liked them more than I did. Being a pickle lover I thought I would enjoy the fried pickles but I didn't really care for them too much. The batter wasn't too flavorful and the pickles tasted more like cucumbers to me.\n\nThe other downside to this place is how slow the service is. My group was seated for about 20 mins before we had to request a waiter from the bar. \n\nOverall it's a good place, but nothing too supreme."

It sits on the northeast corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd.  To me there are three different sections to Park on Fremont, the front patio, the inside, or the back patio.  \n\nThe front patio is perfect for people watching.  Especially at night when you see all the craziness happen on Fremont street.  The inside has tables and bars, it's your standard restaurant setting.  Then you have the back patio which has a more intimate setting.  The back patio also has a secret pathway in the far back left corner which when you walk around the corner is a seesaw.  That's also a designated smoking area.\n\nWhich area would I recommend?  I like the back patio, that's where I've met some random and cool people.  The front patio is also nice but I haven't been able to mingle with people as much as I do in the back patio.  The bar or inside Park on Fremont is your standard restaurant setting.  \n\nI don't care much about the food.  If I was to eat here I'd get the reuben with tots.  But my coworkers after a long nights work love coming down here to have a beer or two.  I just go down the list and try something new every night I join them.  And the selections of different beers is what brings me here at least twice a week.\n\nPark on Fremont you have turned me into a soggy man sandwich!"

Since the servers were neglecting the back area, I got up to return the cold potatoes. When I saw my server, she couldn't be bothered to apologize. She later said they were short staffed.

There were 4 of us including one teenager. After we sat on the outside patio, a young waitress came to us and seemed appalled. \"Did the hostess seat you?\"  \"No, we seated ourself per the sign\". She continued that they don't allow children after 6 pm (20 minutes from our entry time) even though we never saw any posting of the sort or could even figure out why they wouldn't let kids in to eat there, even after 6. We ordered after we convinced the waitress that we would be quick because of a later commitment. Dinner was, fine, nothing special. Fresh but didn't blow me away. At about 6:15 as the waitress brought the check, she tells me, \"I spoke to the manager, and it's ok.\"  OK? Ok for what? We were done. Was she angling for a bigger tip because she \"allowed\" us to skirt this ridiculous, non posted, possibly made up policy? There are a lot of cool little places popping up downtown. Based on other reviews I've read here on Yelp for Park On Fremont, I think that some customer service techniques should be shared with the staff, if anyone there has the skills or cares to share them. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know or any customer that I may have in my limousine when asked for places to eat downtown. I think you have a cool place, I hope you care enough to address the issues you obviously have there."

Yes, I admit that I was part of the reason why some of the people in our group didn't get 5 star service. Heck, I didn't even get 5 star service. But I did get what I thought was a very attentive server.  Carina was very nice, gave her recommendations on what I should eat & drink, and even chatted up a storm with me. One thing I've noticed about restaurants in Las Vegas, waitresses always like to chat and sometimes the conversations can get out control where service for everyone else suffers. While I got excellent service, the rest of our group didn't.  For that, I apologize to Terri R, Alicia R, Sugi, Toni R, and Merrick.  Won't happen again, I promise. \n\nAs for the actual food, I thought it was pretty good and different.  The  items on the menu reminded me of a fusion type Hash House without the huge portions.  Prices for the food are about average to what you find off the strip, but cheap considering you're in tourist land.  I had their Fried Chicken and Waffles with Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  I thought that this was flavorful with a bacon after taste. Their Sweet Potato Tater Tots was something different and thought it was pretty good. I washed my meal down with water, the Unicorn, and some old school Olde English 800.  \n\nAmbiance is a solid 4 stars, maybe a 5 during the weekdays.  We ate outside, which was great for people watching.  The only issue with eating outside is the smell coming out of the sewer.  My suggestion, try to eat inside if you can. It will be tighter, but at least you don't get that horrendous sewer stench.  For drinks, you can take advantage of their bar or backyard garden.  The drinks, or lack there of, was a problem.  Park on Fremont was not prepared for the amount of people for their first week that they ran out of a lot of drinks that were on their menu by 8 PM.  Hopefully, this gets fixed soon. \n\nOverall, I give this place 4 stars even with all the hiccups. I'm giving Park on Fremont a break mainly because this is just the first week they have been open. \n\nFood/Drinks:\n-Fried Chicken and Waffles (Cap N Crunch Fried Chicken with Applewood and Smoked Bacon Waffles):  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-on-fremont-las-vegas?select=GdRGpzfkvB96qtLx9IuLag#yPmBv7KxicmeCtxN5F7P3Q\n\n-The Unicorn (Ketel One Citron Vodka, lemon juice, simple syrup-mint, ginger beer, and lemon wedge):  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-on-fremont-las-vegas?select=Oyv1WrwBhCfkVTLXJmKV8Q#Cr5FTbdQDRnffQj1Sp-6Yg\n\n-Olde English 800 (8-Ball):  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-on-fremont-las-vegas?select=GdRGpzfkvB96qtLx9IuLag#0cE0O4i3lXdqxCCeFhuyvw\n\n\nPS: Park on Fremont needs to change their business hours that are posted on Yelp.  The hours are obviously wrong at the moment.  And again, hopefully their beer stock improves."

Great for 3 in the afternoon or 1 in the morning.\n\nTheir beer and a shot is a deal for $12 and a great way to start a night out. Mixed drinks are also fun to explore, I personally like pillow talk. If you make it out to weekend brunch (which I don't see how you can't since it ends at 4 or 5), get the patio pounder. $20 for a bottle of champagne and orange juice.\n\nBe sure to check out the trivia pursuit cards on the tables, and the see-saw out back."

I first noticed the very interesting interior design with wallpaper on the ceiling and stuffed birds behind the bar.  You don't see that everyday.  The smaller size of the restaurant/bar added to the overall feeling of intimacy.\n\nWere greeted by our server Joe soon after being seated.  During the course of dinner he was attentive, fun and added a nice touch to our great experience.\n\nOMG!  The Fried Mac and Cheese balls were seriously delicious-I could eat them all day.  They had a nice and crispy shell with a gooey bacon-y (is that a word?) center. Plus, you can't go wrong with ramekins filled with hot cheese and a wing-type sauce for dipping.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Mahi Tacos.  At first, I was slightly disappointed at how small they were, but after tasting, I realized they packed a great flavor punch.  The fish was flaky and delicate with a crispy tempura batter, not over-fried.  The tacos were then topped with a creamy chipotle dressing. Yum.\n\nMy partner ordered the classic burger which was 1/2lb topped with American cheese, red onion, tomato, iceburg lettuce, and Thousand Island dressing;  it was cooked to a perfect medium.  I took a bite and had it had a nice beefy flavor.  Along side the burger were crispy fries and a house-made Sriracha ketchup which added a nice zippy touch.  No Heinz here.\n\nThen, my partners cousin ordered the BBQ Texas Burger which she was very happy with; topped with BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, pepper bacon, and an onion ring.  The standout for her were the sweet potato tater tots served with a honey mustard maple dipping sauce.  I had a few and thought they were amazing.  I only wish I would have ordered a side for myself.\n\nI'm so glad we decided to stop in and try out Park on Fremont.  We will be back for sure."

What makes this even sadder is that it is difficult to screw up a Cuban sandwich. It is so basic and usually delicious.

When I'm in there, i completely forget I'm in vegas because back there it feels like I'm in 5 different cities.\n-The drinks are generally pretty good. I appreciate when effort is put into a drink, and they are good for that. The mules are definitely toppers \n-The Philly Mac n Cheese, and the Mac n cheese balls. I never realized Mac n cheese and Philly Cheesesteaks were such a perfect pairing until here. And their Mac n cheese balls are quite ridiculously good. I tip my hat to you\nCons\n- Even when I used to come here on the regular, I was never a fan of their taco tuesdays. their tacos were decent, which isn't a big deal on either way because they're not a taco shop. I did however have an issue with the baby Dos Equis they used to give us. I mean it was like a gulp and a half. I perused the page and wasn't able to see any mention of taco  Tuesday.\n-I tried the chicken and waffle sandwich recently, and maybe its just me, but It wasn't as good as i remembered. I can't quite put my finger on what was different. Maybe it was the waffle or the chicken, but sad face from me.\n-Lie I said, the drinks are mostly good, but there were a few I wasn't a big fan of, but thats completely suggestive\n-People complain about the service. I'm not really going to because its been good and bad, and theres been times when there was a wait to get drinks and stuff, but it wasn't on the server so I try to not do that.\n\nOverall, theres good and bad, I love the ambiance, but idk if thats something that necessarily holds. Two things that do intrigue me to try and check back in with them are the garbage fries; I somehow don't remember ever eating them but a lot of people are raving about it, and the twig and berry. I don't know if its new or if its always been around, but Its definitely something that looks to be worth a try and is part of the good parts of this place"

Granted it was a really busy night and it was one of the few places that weren't charging people to get in. (Seriously DTLV?) \n\nMy boyfriend and I sat ourselves at the largest table available in the main room, yeah it was only 2 of us at the time of seating, but we were waiting for 2 others to join us. We sat around for 10 minutes, while all the waitresses ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. I don't know if their manager doesn't know how to properly assign sections (with them running in and out of the room to the back, but it seemed like they could barely handle the large volume of people). We waited and waited, made eye contact with several people and still no service. I urged my boyfriend to go up to one of them at a computer putting an order in, and she proceeds to tell him that she's \"cut.\" First of all, I'm a server at a high volume restaurant on the strip and I completely understand how annoying it can be when you're super busy and the last thing you want is to add another thing to do to your list of many, but how hard is it to tell a customer, \"let me find a waitress/server who can help you.\" ??? Not that f*ing difficult. \n\nI was pissed and got up myself, looked for someone who would be standing around doing NOTHING (usually managers) sure enough I saw a gentleman standing behind the bar just people watching and walked directly to him and asked him if there were any servers serving the tables in the area because we had yet to be acknowledged. He pretended to act surprised as if he himself didn't see us either, and pointed at the girl... where else, AT THE COMPUTER. Hmmm, really?? All I wanted was to order drinks, shots and a side of french fries. EASY! I'm not a tough customer especially when I can tell people are overwhelmed. She drops our shots off (chocolate cake) no lemons and no sugar. I'm not a bartender, but I'm sure everyone knows they come with both. We ask her for both, walks away. Comes back with a few lemons in a cup and 2 packets of sugar and tosses them on the table and walks away. LITERALLY WALKED AWAY. No, \"is there anything else i can get you?\" no nothing. I was so pissed. I assured my boyfriend and our guests that she wouldn't return until one of our cups were empty or all of them, and I was right. We got our ticket, left no tip and thats exactly what she deserved. I never leave bad tips, but wow service was an embarassment.\n\nSuch a nice place to go if you want to just look around and enjoy the decor, go straight to the bar yourself or else you'll be getting crappy service. Park on Fremont, really need to reconsider the type of people their hiring. Yeah they're pretty and attract a bunch of drunk, high paying customers. But if you can't deliver decent service, then whats the point??? ALL IN ALL, I'd rather pay 10-20 to get into commonwealth or any other bar downtown than to go back to park on fremont. What a shame, so much potential."

The Park provided just the atmosphere for that and then some. The staff is lovely and eager to please. The only downside is they didn't have the beer my partner ordered. Otherwise, perfect place to enjoy the sights of Fremont."

I mean, once you get over the tacky 60s decor, gaudy outfits the bartenders and waitresses have to wear, creepy big headed people wallpaper in the women's restroom, stuffed ducks fornicating above the bar, and caged in teeter-totter in the outside patio area, it's actually a nice bar. I promise.  It all adds to the odd charm.  Everything about this place is different.\n\nLet me expand on the teeter totter.  When you walk out onto the back patio, there's a little 3' gap in the back fence on the left.  That secret passageway leads you to an old looking see-saw in a very claustrophobic fenced in area.  If you look up, you'll notice prison-like barbed wire fencing.  It's kind of a odd feeling, not going to lie.  But as I stated, it all adds to the charm and uniqueness of the place.\n\nThe drinks come out in mason jars, which I am actually a fan of.  The bar service was attentive and timely, even when our large and rowdy bar crawl group was there.  I can't speak for the food unfortunately; I didn't get to try it.  But maybe I'll go back for that (I've heard it's just so-so) just to say I did it and post an update on Yelp."

I liked their chicken bites with the cornflake breading, it came with a really tasty chipotle barbecue sauce for dipping. The sweet potato tots were intriguing, so we ordered them but the cinnamon they were dusted with was a bit too much.\n\nDrinks list was well ordered and extensive.

Mismatched indoor furniture - but outdoors, Haunted Mansion -esq paintings, string lights, and of course, the hipster holy grail: MASON JARS. If Peaches Geldof came back from the grave to design an eatery around her favorite Pinterest board, it would be Park on Fremont.\n\nI've been to PoF 4 times. The biggest issue (other than the pentagram in the bathrooms, which is a huge turn off to even patronizing this place) is that it is so sunny outdoors. Okay, I get that it's cool to have an outdoor seating area, but it's Vegas and it is sweltering a huge chunk of the year. I've seen others who are already eating, pounce on unbused tables in the shade once people get up to leave. I've done it as well. Having to shield your eyes as you eat and sweat just isn't enjoyable. If there were more umbrellas, or even a semi permeable awning of some sort, it'd go a long way to making outdoor dining enjoyable. \n\nHonestly, come during happy hour. The prices are significantly cheaper and the portions are the same. Make sure you check what is covered under the HH menu, drink wise, because I've paid $8 for a well drink that I assumed would be less than $3 based on the special at the time. The 1 lb of chicken wings for $5 and the garbage fries are really the only things I'd recommend. They're delicious. Skip the chicken & waffles which is heavy on the carbs, and lacking in flavor. \n\nService varies from the attentive, to having to go inside to ask where the check is after waiting, waiting, waiting. I've even ordered drinks that never came (and thus I didn't pay for them.) Whatever, PoF's loss. \n\nIf it weren't for the HH chicken wings, the egg topped garbage fries and the fun see saw out back, I wouldn't recommend this place. Oh, and even if you wear flip flops, be careful. Inside, the floors are significantly uneven and I've nearly face planted due to this safety hazard."

I was really excited to check it out because I heard it was really cute and I saw they had a Philly Mac & Cheese!\n\nIt was just my luck though that we chose the worst night to go. The backyard area was closed off for a wedding so we couldn't sit back there and the tables inside were reservations only, so we were sat on the front patio. This would've been fine if it wasn't 100 degrees last night! All of the servers were really sweet though and understood how hot it was, so they helped us out and got us a seat inside because one of their reservations got pushed back a few minutes so they said we could take the table if we could be done before the reservation. We thought that was really nice that they went out of their way to accommodate us.\n\nWe all ended up getting the Steak Tacos which were delicious! I had a big lunch earlier that day so I just wanted something small. It came with 3 tacos and they were the perfect size for a small plate. I also had one of their Moscow mules, which was very refreshing since it was still really hot inside the restaurant.\n\nI definitely wanna go back, but will definitely make sure it's nicer outside next time!"

I'm a pretty big fan of this place, only because it seems like the only real alternative option to my favorite bar The Griffin.  Commonwealth is great but has a line a lot, and Downtown Cocktail Room is also great but is usually empty.  I don't care for the other bars on the block.\n\nPark is great because there's 3 distinct areas that each have their own vibe... the front patio, where you can chill and people watch, and it's awesome if the weather is good.  Inside the bar it's just your run of the mill bar, but has it's own style of exposed wood and stuffed animals (not what you think).  And then out back is this huge backyard playground that if you wandered in off the street you'd never find.\n\nThe bartenders I've dealt with here have all been pretty damn friendly, and that goes a long way to my bar selection.  Add a good beer list and not too expensive prices and you've got a winner in my book."

The chicken and waffle sandwich is neat in concept and plays well with the finger food mentality of the place. The drawback comes in the fact that the waffle was almost soggy and lukewarm. The chicken is nothing impressive. The choice of sides are decent. We went with the potato salad and it was good. They use egg in the mixture and that was very good. As the night progressed I ordered the veggie pita wrap with a side of sweet potato tots. This was better. The warm pita stuffed full with cheese and a variety of grilled vegetables was much better. The fact that they were removing items from their menu left us with little to choose from kind of hindered the dining experience.\n\nThe garden seating is amazing due to its Alice in Wonderland-esque decor. I would love to go back and take everything in. Hopefully the menu will be hashed out by then."

We sat and nursed our drinks for a couple hours without being rushed or hurried to clear the table even after business picked up around 10:30. I ordered a second drink and shortly after receiving it, asked our server if they could hold the table for five minutes so that we could hop into the back-backyard to smoke. She said that'd be fine so we went and played on the teeter totter (yes, the teeter totter) for a few minutes. When we returned my almost-full second drink as well as our other beverages had been completely cleared and the table was reset for new service. We continued to sit and chat while waiting for our check to come. Our server walked by a few times and hesitated, noticing our table was completely cleared. She didn't comment on this and went about her business, serving up many rounds of shots and drinks to a nearby table. Finally, upon receiving our check, we waited another 20 minutes before we could get her back to the table. I explained to her that I didn't get to enjoy my second drink as the table was cleared while we were out back. Without hesitation she apologized and had it removed from our bill. Though, I was happy with the location, atmosphere and drink selection, I was disappointed in the service. There were a lot of people there, but a lot of them seemed to be standing around bored as one or two were running in circles. I will come back to try the food as I have heard amazing things, but we'll make sure to take turns smoking to ensure our table remains ours."

We ordered a Phillymac and Cheese Steak it's was delish! The garbage fries are killer, and the side salad was fresh. Ordered the champagne bottle which was fun. As well as a pillow talk cocktail which was fresh and yummy. We sat on the back patio for hours, the garden is peaceful, the fire is cozy, and the sun felt perfect! Hopscotch was a definite plus. Park on Fremont definitely took me to my happy place! Smiles all around."

Especially the hidden seesaw in the back, it's a nice touch overall. \n\nAs for the food though, I wish I could say the same. When reading the menu majority of the choices sound delicious, but in reality I find the food bland and not too exciting. This time eating I tried the fried chicken and waffle sandwich. Sadly the chicken was dry and I only had a lonely strip of bacon. Honestly tasted a lot better separated than it did as a sandwich. \n\nMy friends ordered the fried egg burger, and typically the egg is over easy when it comes to these burgers. But in their case the egg was fully cooked, I'm not sure if that's something you have to clarify or not. \n\nThe bottomless mimosas were awesome, our server kept them coming without us having to ask for more. The drinks at Park are very good I must say. Nothing to complain about as for drinks. \n\nI love DT and will most likely be at Park weekly, but more for the drinks than the food."

With whimsical artwork and wallpaper, chandeliers, and an outdoor garden patio, I can see this place as a regular haunt for some folks as it does take you out of the Vegas mindset.\n\nI was disappointed in the presentation of our drinks on my (first) outing here. Our cocktails and water were served in those cheap plastic cups, not the mason jars that I've seen in pictures and reviews. Do they only roll them out at a certain time or for certain people? The drinks themselves were not bad. We also had some overpriced-for-the-portion chips and salsa\n\nCould use some better service. My drink did not come out with everyone else's. Thinking that the bartender was backed up, I waited. After my companions were 70% finished with their drinks, I asked our server to check. 5 minutes later she comes back with it, no explanation why my drink took so long. Also, our water was not refilled, despite seeing our server go around with a pitcher every so often. Not good in my eyes, as during my server days, I was taught to always offer/keep water filled when people are drinking for a long period."

Owned by the same group as the nearby Commonwealth, Park on Fremont is just plain cool on the inside.  Look around...stuffed birds behind the bar, a deer head with gold plated machine guns in its antlers, throwback trendy wallpaper, a beer garden that is way too cool for school!  Suffice it to say that you need to come down and check it out.  \n\nThere is not a lot of good food on East Fremont.  Park on Fremont is absolutely quality food!

I also tried the Chicken Bar Bites--Cornflake crusted pieces of real chicken with a trio of sauces...too large to be called nuggets...too small to be called fingers.  There were tasty.  I opted not to order the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  I heard it was a little on the small side, but it sounded so good. Cap'n Crunch fired chicken with applewood, smoked bacon waffles and vanilla maple syrup...I will be eating you in the future...promise!\n\n...I almost forgot!...Sweet Potato Teeter Tots!...soo good! \n\nMy only qualm...and maybe I'm just spit-balling here...all the beers come in mason jars...cool I know...but are they the normal 16oz pour you are expecting?...I'm not up to date on my mason jar volumes, but they felt more like 14oz and I thought I would be getting a standard American Pint.  Maybe I did, but without some actual measuring I'll never know.\n\nCome here for good food while hopping the happening bars of East Fremont!\nCome here for a great beer selection!\nCome here for a beer garden that will make you swear you're not in Vegas!\nCome here for a different take on bar food!\nCome here for sippy, summer cocktails that will transport you poolside!\nCome here just to find the secret smoking area of the patio!\nRegardless of why...you should in fact come here!"

The vintage hipster meets whimsical Alice in Wonderland atmosphere is what attracts me here and on top of that they have delicious drinks! \n\nLooking at their menu, they had such unique and fun names for the drinks such as \"The Bored and the Beautiful\". I ordered the \"Hunting Season\" which sounded like a heavenly mango bloody mary but unfortunately since mangos were not in season, they had to change up the drink a little bit but it was still yummy. The drink I'll always remember is their GRAPEFRUIT BEER! If you love fruity drinks, you MUST get this. I could drink this all day and everyday... if my asian glow/ allergies would allow me to :(\n\nI probably spent half my time here being mesmerized by all the unique decor. I love the quote above the bar, the chandeliers hanging in the hallway, the beautiful outdoor patio with vintage hanging plates and the hidden smoking area with a TEETER TOTTER! I hadn't been on a teeter totter since I was like 4 so I was definitely a little too excited and a little too intoxicated which led to a very painful memory so beware haha. They clearly put a lot of attention to detail in their decor and it's definitely eye catching and distracting!\n\nThere is also an eccentric twist to their vintage decor which was a little creepy for me.... there were one too many pictures of voodoo-ish girl dolls in the bathroom and some lightly morbid decor like the stuffed birds around the bar area that were a little too much for me. I will admit that I was scared that Nancy S. and I were scared to go to the bathroom alone LOL. Maybe it was me and my paranoia but I just felt a slightly haunted vibe going on there. \n\nDespite the creepy things that bothered me a little bit about this place, I would definitely be back for their drinks and cool vibe.

After being super indecisive over where we wanted to have our late lunch, I realized I've had Park on Fremont bookmarked since I've never gone before, and so that was our final choice. Once you reach the entrance, they greeted us and asked if we preferred inside or outside, and because it was so nice outside, we choice out. The host led us to the seating area right outside where we had the entrance of the Fremont Experience right in front of us. I was a bit disappointed and upset because when I had looked at their yelp photos prior to coming in, I saw the beautiful outdoor seating in their garden. It was then that I realized they had two outdoor seating areas. (If I had known the patio she led us to was not connected to the garden, I would have requested to be seated in the backyard garden). Nonetheless, it was still nice and cute. \n\nFood/drinks: So our waitress came and asked us what drinks we would like to start off with. Again, after looking through their yelp reviews and photos, I found that they served Banana Bread Beer and it was super popular (and because I LOVE banana bread, I was curious to how it would taste hehe). Sadly, when I requested for that drink, she said they were all sold out. I didnt prepare myself for a back up but she immediately recommended for me to try their organic strawberry beer, so I agreed. My boyfriend was okay with his first choice, and was happy. Yet, after giving my drink a try, the waitress asked me how I liked it....because she NEVER tried it before... Well, I didn't really enjoy it toooo much. It was okay, tasted like beer filled with strawberry syrup.. Um, I only decided to go with that because she recommended it to me and I trusted her! All along, she's never even tried it!! hahaha, if i knew, I probably would have picked something else on my own that I knew I would like. Oh well, at least I guess I now know how organic strawberry beer tastes like.. lol. Okay, moving on to the food. Since I was trying to go for something a bit light, I ordered the garden burger with sweet potato tots. The burger was a bit bland, but the sweet potato tots came with sweet honey mustard and omg I was addicted to that! hahaha. My boyfriend order the chicken and waffle sandwich with sweet potato tots as well. There wasn't anything really special about his sandwich, I wish the waffle was a bit more crispy. \n\nAll in all, Park on fremont is super cute and I love that! The food is just okay, BUT they have a wide selection of drinks to choose from (it just sucks when they run out, wahh!). Nonetheless, I still enjoyed my experience. Staff is very friendly!"

With about ~20 attendees I made sure to make reservations weeks in advance. Things started off smoothly initially, the waitress was adequate. For a party that big, and considering the place wasn't swamped or anything (it was on a Thursday night), she did the bare minimum. Considering that she knew she was getting auto grat she felt no need to hussle. Also, why did they not designate a back up server for a party of that size? People were without drinks or drink refills for a long time. The food was overpriced and average at best. It took FOREVER to get the plates cleared and out of the way. When she realized she probably had already earned her 18% auto grat or whatever it was on a party that large, she pretty much jumped ship. You had to physically track her down, or wait a very very long time for her to come back around.  The place itself looks cool with some interesting detail, but at that point, the decor was all they had going for them. I would not come back here to sit down and eat, nor would I suggest it to others.. Sure, come through, get a drink from the bar, take in the unique yet highly hipster decor and move on."

FINALLY, an outside beer garden downtown :)\n\nWhen you arrive, the building has an exposed, dark, weathered wood look to it.  There's outside seating in the front of the restaurant, a few high top tables and bar area inside and a lot more table seating in the back garden.  It's definitely a great concept and once the misters are working, the back section will be great for the hot summer coming up!  The staff are always super nice and friendly.  I love the uniforms:  chambray tops and red TOMS for the girls and nice bow ties and other dapper accents for the guys.  Super trendy.  Every time I hang out there, I end up getting a lot of stuff and having a lot of questions.  The staff are all very patient which I appreciate.\n\nFor Drinks:  They have A LOT of beers.  A LOT!  I love the options.  You have the regular Coors lights, Coronas and Guinnesses.  They also have other eclectic options like the banana bread beer and my favorite, the grapefruit beer!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)  The prices range from $5-$10 depending on the beer.  I also highly recommend the Unicorn, a mixed drink that includes a lot of Ginger.  Ginger beer!  Finally, my other favorite option is the pick a beer and shot for $10.  It's a list of about 5 beers and 5 shots.  I usually get the Guinness and Fireball Whiskey shot with this deal.  \n\nFor Food:  The Bar Bites for $8 is AH-MAZE-ING!  Corn flake crusted chicken tenders over fries or tater tots.  Then there's the sweet potato tots!  OMG, they serve it with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  You can also ask for a sriracha ketchup but please be advised:  NO ranch or regular ketchup is offered at all!  I also love the chicken and waffle sandwich for $10.  The chicken is crusted with Capt 'n Crunch, between waffles and drizzled with Wild Turkey maple syrup.  Also served with either fries or tots.  The popular and only sides are the fries, tots or potato salad for $4 each.  The potato salad is creamy and full of soft potato chunks.  \n\nAs you can see from my review, I've visited this place enough to know a few great meals.  I definitely invite you to check this place out.  It's the first business welcoming you into Fremont East.  It'll not only show you how great downtown is transforming into, but it'll also show you how wonderful this place really is.  Check them out :)"

Lots of random stuff to see, and even a see-saw out back! \n\n Our waitress that was taking care of us was great, checking up on us and refilling our drinks without having to ask. Didn't really order any food, but a couple of apps were used as props in a photo shoot going on in the patio area. The Sweet Potato Tots were okay, but not crisp enough for my taste.\n\nOverall, cool vibe and can't say much about the food, but the douchebag doormen up front  may be enough to convince me to steer clear of this spot...

            "review": "I was meeting a bunch of friends nearby for a birthday celebration so, I decided to eat and pre-game here. The interior is interestingly bizarre. The crowd is great if you don't mind hipsters. Plaid shirts, boots, full-sleeve tats and beards...with music you probably have never heard of playing in the background. There's a song that was so not mainstream, Shazam doesn't even know what it is. Is the food from a local source? IDK. Does it have bacon? Yes. Do you drink from mason jars? Yes. Do you have doughnuts? Yes.\n\nBacon-Wrapped Corn Dogs:\nThe more I tell myself I'm going to eat healthy food, the more I rebel. I like to wrap my arms around my legs in yoga and my corn dogs wrapped around with bacon. You get 2 big corn dogs served with Sriracha ketchup and a spicy mustard. The bacon is wrapped around the hotdog then dipped in batter - part of bacon enjoyment is the crispy salty goodness but you won't get that with this. 3/5\n\nPhilly Mac and Cheese Steak:\nThis cheesesteak was actually good but there was just too much bread, not enough meat. Carbo-loading? This is for you. 3.5/5\n\nStranger Danger:\nPeach vodka and iced tea. If you like peach-flavored anything then, you might like this drink. I don't.\n\nTrophy Wife:\nRum, OJ, pineapple juice, lemon, simple syrup and bitters. This was pretty refreshing. Fruity and delicious.\n\nThey do have salads. Looking back, they do have delicious-sounding salads like Strawberry Summer Salad, Steak Salad, Ahi Tuna Salad, etc. But on my last night of drinking, I wanted to get something with more substance. On the menu, right below salads: deep-fried Oreo and Girl Scout Cookies, and Donut Ice Cream Sandwich!\n\nIf you don't like scary movies, stay away from the bathroom or you'll piss your pants. There are creepy pictures on the wall and in front of the sink and in between the two mirrors is a reminder for you to wash your hands: \"Employees must say Bloody Mary three times into mirror before returning to work\" - if you've seen the movie...you'll know what happens."

There wasn't a wait or anything, so we were seated and water was given to us fairly quickly. We sat in the back patio, which was beautiful. The only thing was, there was a smell emitting from the building itself that smelled of sewage. Another complaint of mine was the smoking area. Why was it located all the way in the back and why the heck is there a teeter totter?\nThe waitress seemed annoyed that she was working there, but nonetheless, the food was awesome.\nWe ordered the mac and cheesesteak and a side of fried pickles. The fried pickles could of used more \"pickles\" than fried peppercinis and the music could of been turned down more.The food is fairly priced at the location that it's at and the drinks were cold and refreshing. FYI, don't bring kids here. Unless you want them to be in a steam punk nightmare. And another FYI...the paper towels in the bathroom are camoflauged into the wall. :)"

            "review": "What I thought would be an amazing experience for happy hour turned into a rather mediocre dining experience complete with garbage truck/sewage smell. The entire experience was pretty much ruined by this and had I known the stench would continually waft over our party while we ate I definitely would have chosen a seat outside.\n\nBut ah! The name is \"Park\" on Fremont, and the incredibly tack-full back patio is what this place is also about of course! Unless you are attempting to eat while foul sewage is creeping into your nostrils. Unfortunately this aspect is one I flatly refuse to lure myself into again. If I go back to Park on Fremont I will sit at the bar and leave the stinky patio be.\n\nFood - Veggie Sliders of BORINGNESS. First off the sliders have the right idea, fresh enough veggies, interesting combo, but there was ZERO taste. It was bland, bland, bland and it came with NO sauce. No sauce at all. Um, not even like some veganaise? I'm not a vegetarian, but these sounded/looked yummy. They need seasoning. Please, for the love of all the is good - season the food!\n\nDrink - Drink menu is pretty darn cool. Beer selection is cool. Although I was brought out the *other* raspberry beer that was in stock, rather than the one I actually requested. None the less - delicious. And at $10, I thought yikes! But when I saw it was a Pint I knew I would not even need another drink. My friend had one of their Bloody Mary's, which I tasted and it was yummy. Mixed very well. I would go back to have one in the future.\n\nService - Eh. Although our waitress was nice our drinks took a decade to arrive. Although she said she was \"waiting on the bar\" a few times to us - I can't imagine what the crap the bar was doing - basically, not making our drinks. It was not busy. \n\nAmbiance - Again, sewage smell. Also, to begin with we were sat in the front of the restaurant on Fremont street and I wasn't thrilled. With the cars going by it just was not a nice place to dine. The inside was interesting, but the bar looked somewhat small. \n\nReturn Factor - I am turned off from their food, but I am intrigued with the drink menu and the drinks are what got the extra star for this review, or else it would have been a 2-star. I believe I will be back for drinks and I'll sit at the bar for sure."

We have run into her before in our weekly adventures downtown.  It's awesome to see that this business employs people who make sure to put their customers first!\n\nI have yet to try the food here, but they do have a good $10 beer and a shot special.  And this special doesn't have to involve a well shot.  When they have it, I usually get a Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA (usually around $14 a bottle in most bars) with a Jameson shot.  Definitely a good value!\n\nAs far as their other drinks go, their Bloody Mary drink (made with tequila) is great! Definitely recommend it if you're up to trying something a little different.

The back patio was a great find on our 2nd visit at the end of the night as we waited for our reservation for The Laundry Room.\n\nThe drinks are a nice mix of craft cocktails, and some standbys.  The food was perfect.  We split an order of chicken and waffles and the veggie sliders, with sweet potato tots and potato salad on the side.  I was so over the Vegas excess thing on our last day that I was incredibly grateful for well-prepared food in reasonable portions.  The veggie sliders were absolute heaven, and the perfect amount of food for how I felt that day.  My husband was all over the chicken and waffles, and loved the drink menu.  (He originally wanted to go to the Heart Attack Grill, until he realized they made you wear those gross hospital gowns.  I'm thankful he saved me from that experience)\n\nI wish I could pick this place up and move it to my own neighborhood.

There is plenty of seating out doors in the front, inside, and out doors in the back. The chairs aren't the most comfortable, but sometimes sacrificing comfort for style is necessary. \n\nThey have an impressive selection of beers and I'm amused by the way they are broken up on the menu.

While I did contemplate a fancy Bloody Mary, one of three described on menu, I decided to go for craft beer on tap. My one gripe is that nobody seems to get that Hef lovers don't want apricot, jalape\u00f1o or whatever flavor all the time and no, Blue Moon is not \"craft\", so I settled for an ok blond brew of some sort. Served in mason jar. Because. That's how cool people drink, don't question it.\n\n Now for the food- uncomplicated selection of appetizers, hearty fare and slower metabolism selection, one pager, love it. Against my better judgement of knowing what's good for me, I order Garbage Fries. OMG. I think they are called Garbage Fries because you realize all other fries you've eaten up to now have been garbage. It's a delicious journey into crispy fries, hunks of savory bacon, fresh jalape\u00f1o, diced avocado, fried egg and cheesies. It's probably a 3,000 calorie offering, but I'm ok knocking it down to nothing but tomatoes and eggs for a week to justify these. \n\n There was some talk of tacos and dos Equis specials for Tuesday night, but I'm very happy I didn't sway and stuck with the heavenly fries. \n\n Check it out next time you stumble by on your way to El Cortez!"

There is an outdoor park area (with a hidden see-saw), that lights up at night. The place is filled with unique art and is very kitschy-hipster chi\u0107 (a deer head with machine gun antlers). It has a very modern, artsy feel. \n\n2. Alcohol/Drink\nBooze isn't my forte. I'm not much of a drinker, but they have a ton of microbrews and specialty handcrafted beers (Banana Bread Beer), a lot of which are on tap.They also have microbrew sodas available as well. They have a slew of Bloody Marys with several kitchy names as well as signature cocktails.\n\n3. Food\nMy sister and I got to enjoy dinner on the beautiful patio. Some of the chairs outdoors aren't that comfortable. I ordered the Chicken and Waffle sandwich with sweet potato tots and my sister had the Mac N Cheese Philly with friends. My sandwich, (chickwaff) was pretty good. Double stacked chicken, bacon, and the bread was a Belgian waffle. I couldn't get the whole things in my mouth (that's what she said - Zing!). The sandwich was a bit dry, but our attentive server was happy to bring me extra syrup. The tots were amazing and were served with this homemade honey mustard sauce. OMG. SO GOOD! My sisters sandwich was a gift from the hipster gods. Sweet crimony, I cannot believe she let me sample it (for Yelp Review purposes)! First, this sammie should come with a bib, it's messy, my sister handled it like a pro. The combination of mac N cheese, tender philly steak, peppers, and that cheese sauce! OMG-amazing! The fries were natural cut and served with a spicy homemade ketchup. Another homerun.\n\nPark on Fremont is a solid and welcomed addition to my beloved Fremont East. Great, fun inventive food, inspired libations, comfortable clean, hipster atmosphere. What's not to love. If your looking for a place to park your feet and enjoy some tasty eats, look no further! Cheers, Park!"

But very aesthetically pleasing. \nI came here with 4 friends and the hubs, we waited a little over an hour for a table (they were pretty busy) but we found space at the bar. They have an amazing selection of liquor and beer. I was shocked when the bartender told me they had Johnny Blue for only $21 a shot. I dont normally drink scotch at brunch but that was too good to pass up. \nOnce seated there was massive confusion to who was taking our table, server wise. About 20 minutes into us sitting with no service we had to ask the hostess what was going on. A girl finally came over but then disappeared again before we could order. Then another girl took over and she was awesome. I wish I could remember names but... i was drinking scotch at 11am lol\nAndy and I shared a few different items. We had the Garbage fries (OMG) Morning Skillet, and the Chilaqules. All delicious. Our friends all had the chicken and waffle sandwiches. Those came with sweet potato tater tots. The tots were the best thing on the table besides the garbage fries\nThis is an amazing place to come when youve had a little too much to drink the night before. Amazing hangover/drunk food. \nNeedless to say we will be back!"

Couple this with the $10 beer-and-a-shot menu --and I mean GOOD beer and GOOD shots, I had a Wexford's Irish Cream Ale and a Jameson-- and I find the Park as the first Fremont East Bar to make it into my 'downtown rounds' list.\n*I'm a bit sad that they got rid of the veggie sliders, without those, I see little reason to grub here.

This new gastropub situated at the corner of Freemont and Las Vegas Blvd between Radio City Pizza & a parking lot   (hence the name) is a lovely welcome to the ever changing DTLV. \n\nThe decor is warm. Distressed wood is the framework surrounding the copper lined bar. There is seating for the bar that is both indoor as well as outdoor. The front of the space has a minimal patio that is facing the front entrance as well as the small part of the side facing the lot. It's white picket fence that frames the patio seperates you from the fact that you're literally  part of the street and lot. The floor wood pattern layout is stunning.\n\nThere are black and white sketches of animals/skeletal that add to the setting of the space. The indoor seating is all banquet with booth tables that are suitable for large groups. The seats are upholstered with fun patterns in different colors that add to the charm of the place. The staff uniforms were hipster chic and alleviated any concerns of haughtiness you may have. Maybe because it was Easter Sunday a few of the servers looked more bored rather then being engaging. Hopefully these are just opening weekend kinks that need to be smoothed out.\n\nAnd now the highlight...The secret garden. There is a lovely beer garden laced with flowers and charming metal garden furniture. It is peaceful and isolated in the back of the space. Its a perfect spot for a small gathering. They even have a minature bar that could be set up for exclusive use of the back space.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit. Great spot to hang with friends and sample their many varieties of beers and cocktails. I loved that they had a unique takes on the bloody mary. They claimed to be out of a few beers because of their opening weekend so I hope that problem won't be ongoing. Mason jars of all sizes for beverage service too.\n\nThe only reason I deducted a star was because the steak mac & cheese came on a bun. It was carb overkill and took away from that deliciousness of the ingredients. We also tried the chicken bar bites and I say kudos for the crunch, flavor and crispness of the snack sized treat.\n\nI wonder if the proprietors took notes from the ever successful neighborhood bars in the LES & Brooklyn, NYC. If you've ever been to the Meatball shop you'd know what I was talking about.The resemblances were uncanny and truly welcomed by an NYC transplant who is homesick time to time"

Copper tables, barstools, foot rails  every thing looked hand made. With saloon style wallpaper on the ceiling and some really cool hunting art on the walls my favorite piece was the stuffed deer head with gold punk rock spiked antlers that curved into 2 Gold machine guns. Yes machine guns And a painted cartoon style rendition of lady gaga in her meat dress.\n\n it wasn't till I couldn't find pizza on the small menu as the waiter was taking our order and when I asked he said no that's next door. (awkward) I thought park on Fremont was where you park. ( lol) So I scanned quickly as my friend ordered a cheese burger, Fries and Mac and cheese balls. I got the cajun chicken sandwich and fries with extra seasoning. The food was pretty good the chicken had just enough Cajun seasoning. Juicy chicken my friends burger was really good he had not had a burger in awhile so it was a treat for him fries were good and the Mac and cheese balls are delicious with a little bacon and taste home made. My friend don't eat pork and ate 4 of them. For dessert i had to have a doughnut ice cream sandwich. You gotta try one of these. Off the charts. Check was about 39 bucks + a 20% tip .  \n\nNothing worth taking a star away for. It was a good experience overall. And I will take my wife and pictures next time I go. \n\nPs the pizza place next store was out of business."

Our group works in show business here and would be coming after shows. \nWhoever answered the phone a week ago said they would make a reservation for me to ensure staffing. I called to double check yesterday morning and there was no reservation, nor enough staff. After discussing this with Julie, my understanding was that they would be staffed, and would take care of our large group who loved this bar. Also discussed was that on their site it states open till 3am. We would definitely be there till at least 2. She stated they usually close at 1 on Tuesdays but if there was business they stay open. Great! \nNope. I arrived to last call at 12:20am, a bar of 30+ people (almost ALL) were our group and an obstinate and ridiculous manager stating no one was there at 11:30p like the reservation said ( not true as well) so they were going to close. CLOSE WITH A FULL BAR AND MORE COMING. \nUnacceptable. \nWe left immediately, deciding to give our money and very loyal patronage to #donttellmama across the street. \nWorst manager ever.

She sat us back in patio seating and I noticed how unique the vibe was because of the decor of the restaurant. \n\n\"The Vibe\"-Honestly it felt like I was walking through a scene of a cool beer commercial as we were walking down the hallway to the patio. clean, bugged out, and a hint of sexy. \n\n\"The Service\" - After they cleared out our table/bench, it took a few minutes for me to flag down a server, but I guess that was cool because it took a while for us to figure out what exactly we wanted to. When she came, she was super cool and gave us great recommendations for our food. Got to give it up to Corina...she was dope. \n\n\"The Food\" - We ordered our drinks first and little did I know that my friend was on a mission to find \"Banana Bread Beer!\" supposedly its pretty rare to find but hella good.  So that was a huge plus for me and my friend.The hostess told me to order \"the Philly Mac and Cheesesteak sandwich\" and the sweet potato tots, I did not disappoint . My meal had all kinds of cheesy cinnamony goodness. My friends and I all decided to share food, my homegirl decided to order the Chicken waffle sandwich which was also really good, and my other friend ordered the veggie sliders. All the food had a great flavor. It was super hard to make a decision here , because I also wanted to try their burgers. \n\nIn the end my friends and I agreed that this is the type of spot , we would most definitely do a turn around trip from LA to Vegas, because everything was on point and awesome!"

The chicken was tough and stringy and the corn flake batter wasn't a good texture. I would still go back  but I would try something else. \n\nAtmosphere: Very fun and interesting. They have a lot of artwork and pieces that are a great topic of conversation. It could be thought of as a little creepy. Behind the bar, directly in front of seating is a wall filled with taxidermy birds which really freaked me out since I am scared of birds. Even though, I love their food so I try to look down or at my lunch companions. \n\nI also know that there is an outdoor area which I heard was great at night but I haven't made my way back there yet. Indoor seating has about 5-6 tables of 4 on the inside and quite a bit of bar seating. It would be hard for a large party of 8 or more to sit together if you just walked in for lunch time."

They seem to be going for an LA vibe that seemed ill suited. My husband ordered the steak salad, which was pretty delicious, and I got the chicken finger like option--pretty basic. The drinks were delish. Enjoyed our visit here overall."

            "review": "Definitely a different vibe and scenery from your other typical Downtown LV Fremont Street establishment.  Which I have to say is a very good thing.  I almost felt like this could be a gastro pub plucked right out of Downtown Santa Barbara or San Diego and through the technomagic of 22nd century additive manufacturing process better known as 3D printing technology reassembled layer by layer in the spot it currently occupied on 506 E Fremont Street in Las Vegas.\n\nThe abundance of flora, interesting selection of dark wall paintings and other decorations, the open air outdoor seating area in the rear, all reminded me of portions of SoCal, even though I am sure this is an original design.  Homesick much?  Maybe.\n\nSo I made my way to yet another pub type establishment, because of yet another friend's \"temporary relocation away from Las Vegas\" party or you can shorten it to your plain old going away party, but I felt the need for verbosity.  It was still relatively early, about 6pm, and my eyes had a hard time adjusting to the dimly lit interior as you walk into the bar area off the street.  The bartender and whoever else were working there must be busy, because no one acknowledge my presence at all.  Total fail on my part, especially after I had completed a session on How To Make An entrance at a work related workshop.   Not to be deterred by having been slighted by these employees, I brazing set off to explore the depth of this unwelcoming alcoholic dispensary.  I was shortly rewarded with the sight of a pleasant outdoor seating area, seemingly from another age.  Victorian perhaps, although with an added deliberate state of rehabilitation, for that extra feeling of mysteriousness.\n\nJust like the people of the Victorian age in London, as my many hours of period drama viewing have taught me, the behaviors of the workers in this obscured portion of the pub conformed more expectedly to the ethereal temporal throwback of that bygone age.  In other words, they acted according to their station, and greeted customers with obvious courteous deference.  A menu and a mason jar of water was promptly brought out, as I waited for the entire gathering to assemble.\n\n[Fast forward to the exciting part of the review - the food!]\n\nSummer Strawberry Salad - very nice and tasty.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The salad was served on an eco-friendly bamboo plate. A little more gorgonzola cheese crumbles would be nice, but not a deal breaker at $12 a serving.\n\nCuban Sandwich - Decent, not the greatest, but I too finished it being brought up not to waste food as a child.  But I am thinking this was a seasonal promotion, as I no longer see it on their online menu.  Or it was simply not that popular.\n\nI also had a few bites of a friend's Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  He was on a perpetual quest to find a good version of it here somewhere in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately his quest must continue, as the version here disappointed him greatly.  The waffle was the offending element if you must know more details.  \n\nSweet Potato Teeter Tots that came with the sandwiches were good, especially with the dipping sauces.  Way better than fries I am sure.\n\nThe Classic Burger - didn't get to try it, but that looked very good and only comes with the MSRP of $9.\n\nOverall, a nice little get away to dine at near Fremont Street.  Now that the weather is getting nicer again, it will be back on the list of places to hit up before it gets excessively hot.\n\nIf you are bored, explore the rear rear of the property, where you get to seesaw like you did when time was simpler, the chance of upward class mobility was bright, and the Pacific is not irradiated.\n\n3 stars!\n\nReview #10 of 2014"

The decor and ambiance is a little spooky but cool if you are into the whole goth creepy kid look - I didn't get a chance to walk around and see the back area but I'm sure it's cute.  The restroom light is dim and sets a mysterious mood when you are welcomed by strange wall paper of distorted orphan-like kids and framed portraits.  Also, there was a sign on the mirror that said \"workers had to say bloody mary three times in the mirror before going back to work\". AHHHHHH!!!!!  \n\nOur waiter was a super hot dood so that was a plus.  We had their specialty drink: Pillow Talk for $9 it was tasty but it would have taken four of these drinks to get me on a nice buzz. Appetizers: Chicken Wings $9 not bad.  \n\nDefinitely should check it out!"

But unfortunately, the food and cocktails are just mediocre and the service is awful. It takes forever to get your server to pay attention to you, and when they do, they're rude. \n\nThe last time I was there, I was with a table of 8 and we were the only people in the place. After waiting 20 minutes for the cocktails we ordered, we walked inside to the bar and picked them up ourselves. Our waitress NEVER came back to our table. We intended to order food too, but ended up just paying the bartender and leaving."

Plus a small, but decent arrangement of whiskeys, my poison for the evening was Knob Creek, Straight Rye.

After making reservations for dinner and going there it  became clear that Park on Fremont is actually a bar that serves a small variety of burgers, sandwiches, and appetizers that could be considered higher-end bar food. \n\nMac & Cheese Balls were all mac and no cheese, unless the little plastic tub of cheesy-flavored dip served with them was supposed to be the cheese, and had a distinct artificial bacon flavor. Being only macaroni noodles in the fried balls, they were dry and bland and overall were a disappointment. \n\nChicken Bar Bites with their Honey Mustard sauce were plump and delicious and were served with excellent sweet potato tots. These were a winner. \n\nAfter these two appetizers and a couple of small mason jars of Guinness at $8.00 each and house cocktails at $10.00 each we bailed and headed out for dinner somewhere else. \n\nBTW the Downtown Las Vegas powers-that-be have decided to go against the Strip philosophy of free parking for everyone and have made street parking in the blocks around Park on Fremont pay-parking only."

OK, not a particularly enchanting environment, but it was a beautiful day.  I propelled myself into a optimistic urban renewal mindset and the cocktail and beer menus looked encouraging, though I was a tad miffed that the beer menu was vague in description and had no prices.  Even after pondering those menus for over 15 minutes, many of the items still appeared like something we might want to sample if only someone would come by to take our order.  Where's Godot?  Apparently not on that side of Park on Fremont.\n\nSo there we are, dying on the vine, but still with enough hope and vitality to get up and walk inside and then back out to the garden in the back rather than just walk out (which was an option we tossed around) and then tad-dah....a little quixotic haven came into sight .\n\nThe ambiance: think Alice in Wonderland on acid with her own show on HGTV.  Flowers, statues,  vintage plates, metal furniture, picture of horses copulating, freakish wallpaper; totally awesome!\n\nThe service:  thank you Andera for listening to us bemoan our previous shunning, for finding out the answers to all our questions, and for turning the whole service experience around to make it that awesome as well!\n\nLibations: Trophy Wife and Olde English 800.

After ordering we waited for 45min for our food to arrive. The waitress only came to the table twice out of the two hours of us being there. Once to drop off the food and once to drop off the drinks, we had to ask twice for refills. After getting our food my sister had the wrong order delivered, when she finally got her order there was a black hair mixed into the guacamole. The manager on duty spoke with my 15 year old sister about the experience we had. Even though I tried speaking she directed everything to a child at the table.

Even the busboys were fast and very efficient at clearing our table and making sure everything was ok. \nI ate the chicken and waffle sandwich and had the Unicorn cocktail. I was in heaven. Then a shot of patron and a strawberry beer for dessert. Even the sweet potato \"teeter tots\" were to die for. \nHubs and I both ate and drank for under $70 and were more then satisfied. I highly recommend this place for all you hipsters that hang out in \"old Vegas\", or you normal peeps out on a date. The atmosphere is rad. Ask to sit out in the back porch. For reals."

My husband and I arrived on a Wednesday evening for happy hour. We were seating inside by super friendly servers who made us feel comfortable and well attended.\n\nWe both got Wells cocktails ($3 each) and an order of fries pickles ($5) before our main dishes. The appetizer was crispy, well seasoned, and filling. After the pickles we ordered the cheesesteak and chicken and waffles.  I liked both so much that I begged my husband to split the meals 50/50 just so I could enjoy the flavors equally. Btw, the tots are friggin bomb.\n\nLoved everything about this place. Wish it was a tad bit warmer out though. Totally would have sat on the cute patio."

I read many Yelper reviews and had to try this place for myself.\n\nThe outdoor patio was full and so we decided to eat inside. We were seated at a comfortable corner booth. Our server arrived and initially not a real warmth to her personality but she grew nicer as the evening progressed. Sometimes I wonder what ever happened to quality customer service??!! The restaurant itself has some unusual and cool art hanging on the walls. There is wallpaper on the ceiling too which gave the interior character.\n\nAnyway I had read they offer a nice selection of microbrewed beer and my husband and I both ordered a pint of Moose Drool. Well, a couple minutes later our server came back to inform us that they were out of that beer. We then ordered two Alleycat Amber Ales I always wonder how restaurants run out of a certain beer. Shouldn't they order enough? Here is the food breakdown:\n\nMac N Cheese/Phillysteak sandwich - a recommended dish and my friends enjoyed it. It was moist and the meat was tender. The Mac and cheese was a nice touch and added flavor.\n\nFish Tacos - my choice. These were really spicy with chipotle mayo, cilantro, cabbage and fish. The fish was crunchy, light and fluffy. I give these 5 stars on their own!\n\nSteak Tacos - my husband had these and I had a couple bites. Super basic tacos with very little flavor. The meat tasted like rubber and was very  over cooked. Probably the worst choice on the menu.\n\nWill I go back? I probably would just to sit outside on the cool back patio and to eat a couple more fish tacos!"

I had the Philly Mac & Cheese Steak with a side of Garbage Fries for an extra $5.\n\nPhilly: By far one of the most innovative yet flavorful Philly cheesesteaks I've had. I've had my share of Phillies that lacked boldness in flavor which is why I normally order them with provolone cheese, but this one just nailed it AND with Mac and cheese. I liked that they added breadcrumbs on the Mac and cheese because it added that extra texture to the overall sandwich.\n\nGarbage fries: Did not taste ANYTHING like its name. Just from looking at it, it doesn't really look like it would be that flavorful, but I was so wrong. The fries were fried to perfection without it being way too greasy, and the egg complimented the dish very well. I'm almost convinced that the boldness in flavor came from the sauce that they used. Either way, suuuper delicious."

The Park on Fremont was a great breath of fresh air, both for the atmosphere (actual wood) and the price (holy cow $5 for happy hour food?). The drinks were good, I can see how they would be seen as 'hipster,' but I got a mule and a beer and the mule was excellent. \n\nThe food. Oh, the food. Let me say now that if you are hammered and go here, eat to your hearts content. But beware the food portions can sneak up on you. For our first round my associate and I ordered wings and 'garbage' (read: nacho) fries with a fried egg on top. The fried egg alone made the fries seem like they were copulated in another universe. The wings were pretty good as well. \n\nOur second round consisted of boneless wings (so we could try the sauces) and the deep-friend mac and cheese balls. We were way in over our heads.....within one portion of each we were tapping out faster than you could imagine. The fried mac and cheese balls were insane, amazing, I don't have any other words for it. I just wish I could have finished them all :\\\n\nIf I was forced to go to Las Vegas again you bet your behind I would go back to the park."

Also, this review is for daytime service & food, not what it turns into at night.\n\nThe food isn't that special. At least it's not super expensive. The drinks are pretty good, fond of the beermosa and grapefruit beer. Mimosa brunch is kind of a joke, but I come from LA where mimosa brunch is a dime a dozen. I don't get how mimosa brunching is not a thing in Vegas...? They fill a 6 oz mason jar about halfway with your mimosa and our server took her sweet ass time coming back refills. What happened to leaving the carafe of OJ and the bottle of champagne on the table? We flagged down 3 different servers to grab us our 5th refill (prob the equivalent of our 2nd glass) and when our actual server came back she was like oh they already brought them! And we said we would gladly take the second one! (since y'all were sleepin on it). And this mimosa brunch is crazy expensive too, $20 for bottomless? I haven't found anything in Vegas cheaper than $15 for bottomless - out of control. \n\nThose 3 stars represent decor and the fact there are 2 outside patios. I also kinda like how the inside is just essentially big hallway (with tables and a bar) that you walk through. There aren't really doors. Lame to like, but true. Everyone loves the back patio, and the see-saw. There was also live music when we went on Sunday afternoon around 2pm, which was nice."

It reminds me of downtown where I am from so I had a particularly home like feeling being there.  The music was also on point.  Overall a great feel here.\n\nThe shooter made with Absinthe is by far the best drink made with Absinthe that I have ever had.  A very difficult feat, because as a main ingredient absinthe is hard to make tasty.  Absinthe, despite all its hype, tastes like ass.  This shooter however did not.  I believe it was called the Funderwear.  I could do more of these, and they could be dangerous.\n\nAlso the shot/beer combos available are a nice touch, and something I will be coming back specifically for.\n\nThe beer list itself, needs to be reformatted.  There is no organization to it at all.  \n\nThe specialty cocktails were decent, but a bit lacking in complexity, and a touch on the sweet side.  They weren't bad, but they also didn't jump out as very memorable. \n\nThen there is the bad.  The Veggie sliders are a complete disaster of a dish.  I am curious if the people making them have ever actually eaten them.  Sliders 101: ALWAYS TOAST THE BUNS.  Serving sliders on untoasted buns is culinary blasphemy.  The patties weren't cooked very well, and overall they had a slapped together feel to them.  The tots that accompanied were added insult to injury.  They taste as if they are either dusted with confection sugar, or semi-battered with funnel cake batter.  Applause for the shot at uniqueness, but simply a sad moment for anyone who enjoys tots.  I have NEVER not eaten all of my tots before.  I am a fatty when it comes to tater tots.  I will devour villages and small cities worth of tater tots.  Generations upon generations of tots have been simply wiped out by me.  I couldn't muster the will to eat more than 5 of these and all 5 were eaten somewhat forcibly.  My natural instinct to love tots was thrown into a distraught mess of confusion.\n\nTater tots should be crispy and crunchy on the out side, and warm and plentiful with hot fried potato goodness on the inside with a touch of salt.  You want to get crazy, add a spice to them(Cajun maybe?), or a unique sauce on the side.  For the sake of all that is delicious, ditch the funnel cake version, please.\n\nThis was the only dish we had, but I have heard similar criticisms from foodie friends of mine about many of the dishes here.  Just because you are downtown doesn't mean you can slack on your food.  You are in downtown Vegas, one of the biggest food epicenters of the US.  Your biggest target market is locals, and the locals in Vegas are foodies for the most part.  We will wait for food, and we will pay for food, but it needs to deliver.  You have such a great location for what you are offering, take advantage of it.\n\nThe servers were very friendly and engaging, as well as the hostesses.  Whoever did the hiring of the FOH staff made solid choices.  Very refreshing after eating at some places with impersonal and seemingly unconscious staff lately.\n\nI do hope the food improves, because I really enjoy the vibe here and that location is in need of a great spot to eat at."

It's dark, mysterious, charming, just so cute.\nAs far as drinks, I've had the bloody mary which is very good! The drink menu is unique and after sips of my friends' drinks, it's not bad at all. \nThe food is also quite good. I recommend the chilaquiles. \nOf course as a new place downtown, it isn't cheap. The food is small portioned so I would only go on a nice night on the town, not when I'm terribly hungry. It's definitely more of a place to socialize, not to go home stuffed. But then again, I can eat a lot haha! So if you're a dainty eater, you'll be fine.\nThe reason why I'm giving it a \"meh\" rating is because the service took WAY too long. I took my sister who's from out of town so the only reason we didn't mind the wait was because we had so much catching up to do.\nI went on a random Monday at 4pm...not peak hours at all. We ordered drinks, that look 20 minutes to come, ordered some sides, another 25 minutes, my boyfriend asked for ranch...that took 15 minutes-he was basically done eating! Another 30 minutes go by and we finally see her to ask for the tab. Another 15 minutes and our server never came. We actually had to ask another server not assigned to us to take our tab up to be paid so we could leave.\nWhen we first got there, there were 3 parties including us so it really should not have taken as long as it did.\nDon't get me wrong, the servers are very sweet. But the wait for the smallest things was ridiculous so come with time on your hands. The first time I came was on a busy, busy Friday night and the service was MUCH faster on a night with a full house. So the fact that I came on a Monday afternoon when there were only two other tables in the patio aside from us and the service was beyond slow was kind of ridiculous.\nBut I do love the ambiance, the originality of the drinks, and the food so I'll be back."

It's like Tim Burton collaborated with an interior designer and suggested, \"less goth more abstract,\" \"mute the colors,\" and \"throw in some flair shit like TGIFridays does.\" And so they came up with ceilingpaper patterns, fireplace beer taps, record player jukebox, taxidermy birds... I could enjoy spending all day just looking at this stuff... and eating stuff!\n\nThe eats we had on this visit were small and perfect for a casual bite. We got in around 6pm and it turned out to be happy hour, so we took advantage. I had the Steak Tacos ($6, normally $9) which came with three tasty corn tortilla tacos with salsa, guac, and sour cream. Also ordered the Garbage ($6, normally $13) fries, which can be substituted with tots or chips.

I'm amazed they didn't do any kind of up-charge for the switch! Awesome.

It's insane! Not a deal!\n\nSo Park, I suggest doing a real happy hour menu, instead of serving customers those stupid mini-sized drinks and pretending that is some kind of bargain. People are better off paying full price and getting a decent sized drink. That is not what happy hour is, and definitely not making anyone happy!"

Then once I put the menu down I couldn't get anyone's attention to place my order with four men behind the bar. After 7 mins finally Alex asked for my order he puts it in and forgets my drink. One of the other bartenders named Doug ask if I wanted a drink and I told him \"the other guy took my order but I think he forgot.\" He grabs my drink and 3 mins later the first guy brings out a beer for me. Then time come for me to grab my check I can't get anyone's attention. One bartender Doug who brought drink he's actually busy. Another guy is talking to his customers. Then is making drinks and having Dan taste it but I can't get my check it takes me grabbing a host just to tell someone to grab my check. The time for me to grab her in between and waiting to get someone's attention 15 mins. I miss the old staff they had here. Two years ago best staff ever... now anyone can get hired here. Probably won't be back. I use to come every Tuesday for taco Tuesday but the staffed changed to much and service went down hill."

The live music by the door was great, the beer selection was spot on, and our bartender (Matthew? I threw away my receipt on accident ) was incredible! I'm also a bartender and like people watching others in the same profession.  He handled his bar and his customers with great professionalism and was great with conversation. As we were leaving he pointed us towards the little sweet spot in the back,  how perfect! We will definitely be back!"

If you are a wine drinker, forget about it. Trying to be healthy (not many options there), I ordered the Asian Chicken salad with cucumber noodles. The salad was mostly cut up iceberg lettuce, hardly any chicken and I was hard pressed to find the cucumber noodles. My friends loved the garbage fries, but their sandwich was meh. \n\nOur waiter tried, but he was in one section inside and ours on the back patio. The singer they had on the back patio for Sunday bruch was terrific.\n\nAs a local, I'd advise you to walk up the street to Radio City Pizza (new menu!) or across to Le Thai if you want to eat and drink well."

The reason I am giving Park on Fremont three stars is because of the service and SUPER LOUD MUSIC in the garden.  \n\n8:30pm Friday night - When we got to the restaurant, I told the hostess we needed a table for two.  She started guiding us to a table outside facing Fremont Street, so I asked her if there was a table available in the back garden.  She told us that if we wanted to take a seat in the front, she would come get us once a table was ready in the garden.  \n\nTwenty minutes went by, and the hostess (girl with long/straight/two toned hair), was nowhere to be found.  Seems as though she went on break and forgot about us.  After my guest and I were done with our first round of drinks, I decided to go up to the new hostess to ask if a table was available for us in the back.  The new hostess apologized that her coworker had forgotten about us, and then walked us into the back garden, where there were several open seats - why we weren't given a seat in the garden initially is a mystery to me.  \n\nThe garden was exactly what I imagined it to be.  I wouldn't recommend taking older folks here, since the music is LOUD and some of the chairs are slightly uncomfortable.  \n\nI wish they had more apps on the menu.  It would be nice to order a few sides, rather than a large meal.  They have fries, etc, but nothing healthy.  I ended up ordering the veggie sliders - which were delicious.  The buns were stale, but the veggie patty itself, was delicious!  My guest had the corn flake crusted chicken and he LOVED IT!\n\nThroughout the meal, our waitress was missing, a lot.  Our drinks were empty most of the time, and I even noticed the table next to us making loud slurping noises from their glasses (probably hoping to get the attention of a waiter).  The outside bar had a group of employees hanging around talking most of the time, so the issue wasn't understaffing.  \n\nI hope management reads these reviews, because I really want to like this place.  I am hoping it was just a bad night.  I'll be back soon to try it again, but if the service is still sloppy and careless, I won't be back.  I used to be a concierge at a major strip property, and I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending this place yet to anyone (until they work our these small, but large, kinks).  I hope I can come back here at a later time and update my review with more stars - like I said, I really want to like this place.  \n\nI LOVE Commonwealth, and know it's owned by the same creators, but I don't feel like it's exactly up to par with it yet."

I've been here many times before, and this is my favorite bar, so I guess it deserves a review finally. \n\nFacility: this is a very eclectic, quirky, fun bar.  The artwork is weird, but makes for a great conversation piece every time I come. There is outside seating in front of the bar, in case you want to people watch everyone on Fremont. There is bar seating directly inside and even a few booths.  Out back there is an amazing private garden, and this is my favorite spot.  It has greenery, cool art, and a fireplace. There is even a small smoking area behind it with a working heavy duty see saw for grown ups. \nWe sat out here, because it was a pretty nice evening, but for those that had a chill, they even had those portable heaters that look like a light pole to move to your table. \n\nService:  most of the time I have great service here.  With our big group last night, there was one waiter that was a little pushy about clearing the plates. I appreciate someone asking \"Is there anything I can take?\", but he kept specifically asking for each plate on the table, \"can I take this?\", then on to the next one, \"Can I take this?\" \nWhen people are talking and drinking, they tend to pick, so just leave the food. He even went so far as to say in response to someone saying, \"Is there still some in there\", as he was removing it...\"It's cold, are you going to eat it like that?\" \nWell, not after you called it out at the whole table like that!\nAnyway, besides that guy, the staff is courteous, helpful and attentive. \n\nFood and drinks:  they have this yummy grapefruit beer I get every time I go. I started out drinking the $1 beers on special last night, but be warned, they are only 7oz mini bottle beers. They are so cute though. They said they ran out of Dos XX, so they served Sol instead. Then they ran out of Sol and they magically had Dos XX again. LOL! \nAnyway, I ended up switching back to my grapefruit after a while. \nWe ordered the $2 tacos, which were small, but pretty tasty, especially after I ordered some jalape\u00f1os to top them off with. \nThen we ordered a mix of appetizers from the happy hour, such as garbage fries, fried pickles and Mac and cheese balls. All of them were good bar food. The garbage fries are really good with a bunch of topping such as cheese, fresh jalape\u00f1os, avocado, bacon, and a sunny side up egg on top. Yum!\n\nOverall:  I love this bar. Between the cool atmosphere, good bar food, and grapefruit beer, I will continue to come back."

I let a few people take a pickle and I had 3 bites. \n\nThe BF got a burger and it was not medium as requested but well done, no pink at all.

The tall stools weren't so comfy to sit on though so try to sit on the tables and not the back tall table if possible. \n\nDrinks and food could have better consistency standards. This place could be amazing as the spot and ambiance is right, but it falls short in serving quality."

The hostess immediately greeted us upon entry. Staff was dressed casually, our server talked to us straight forward, nothing came across as \"scripted\" as would happen at other places.\n\nMy wife ate what was called \"garbage.\" Let me type that again, my wife ate what was called \"garbage.\" They are described as \"Our house made fries layered with melted cheddar and provolone cheese and covered with bacon, jalapenos, green onions, tomatoes, chipotle peppers, avocados and topped with fried egg.\" My wife took the jalapenos off.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Bar Bites which are cornflake crusted boneless chicken tenders served plain or tossed in your choice of sauce. Honey Mustard, Buffalo, Chipotle BBQ. Our server brought eight small containers, each filled with sauces. \n\nThe food however just didn't \"wow\" us, which is why I didn't give a 5 star rating.\nWhile we were eating a large group of people, 20-24 individuals I would say. Came in through the front door, and walked through the restaurant towards the patio dining area in the back. I thought to myself what a large party this is. Not 5 minutes later the same group of people, LEFT right out the front door. Turns out this group of people are a tourist group that WALKS through various restaurants. Great publicity for Park On Fremont. But I would be starving after \"a tour.\"\n\nThis place is not for children... look at the pictures.\n\nThis place is unique to say the least.

I have also been in to grab drinks from the bar on several occasions.\n\nThe first time we came for brunch our server was awful. First we sat at our table for about 20 minutes before anyone greeted us.  Finally our server comes over and it doesn't get any better.  It seemed like it was her first day serving EVER since she couldn't give a single recommendation on what to order and even messed up several of our orders.  We were a party of 6 and it took 30 minutes to get drinks.  Finally our food came out and the portions were quite small. Good luck on splitting checks here even if you tell the server you want separate checks in the beginning.  I know that servers hate that but Vegas is a tourist town and any restaurant should expect groups to come in and want to pay separate.  It took her about 45 minutes to split everything and finally bring us our checks.\n\nI decided to give their brunch another try and came back with a party of 4 about 6 months later.  Same thing. We sat for about 20 minutes before our server came over.  She seemed rushed and had zero personality.  The food came out and the portions did not get any bigger.  Drinks took forever and so did our food.  We paid with 2 credit cards and just split it so it was a little easier on the server.  Both meals I was never thanked for coming in by the server or any staff member. \n\nIf you come in the summer months put on plenty of sunblock as there is little to no shade protecting you while you sit outside. I saw a lot of customers dripping in sweat.\n\nWe stopped in after first Friday and sat in a booth inside to get drinks and some food.  Again server was aloof and seemed hurried.  After seeing this on 3 separate occasions I would tell management to hire more staff or servers who are more experienced and don't seem so frazzled.\n\nAll that aside this bar is hip and fun and also has a secret seesaw in the back of the bar.  My advice: come in have a drink with friends and jump on the seesaw for kicks then head to the next bar.  If you want to grab a quick bite don't expect to be out in under an hour.\n\nThe fried pickles are good as well as the chicken and waffle sandwich. Overall there are much nicer brunch spots in Vegas that have better service, bigger portions, and tastier food."

We had a large group at a picnic table on the patio in the back, it has a charming feel to it. Water and drinks are served in mason jars, another detail which was cute. \n\nSince it is summer in Vegas, I was looking for a light option: the Strawberry Salad another Yelper was enjoying looked great. First I asked if any protein could be substituted for chicken, as I'm a Pescetarian: answer was no. The salad was indeed refreshing with berries, walnuts, gorgonzola and mixed greens. When the bill arrived, I was shocked that I was charged $12.00; the same price as the salad with chicken. A \"tall\" Belvedere and soda was also $12.00. Didn't want to nitpick at a party, so I paid my $31 (with Auotgrat, tax etc) and we explored the teeter totter/smoking area of patio and took photos. \n\nService was professional and a little over zealous on bussing. Different people kept asking to clear plates and at one point, took someone's unfinished meal. Water glasses were regularly filled and we were asked if we needed more drinks, etc. Those having the chicken and waffle sandwich were underwhelmed: the waffle was not crispy on the outside and one said something seemed to be missing. Both the sweet potato tot and fried pickle I tasted were good; the sriracha ketchup was great - and I don't care for ketchup! In all, the meals were good, but not great. \n\nThe patio is really pretty and has some quirky and interesting decor: mismatched plates adorn one wall and a large portrait of horses ummm mating, another. Eclectic. It looks very pretty lit up at night. \n\nI'd definitely come back for drinks, the bar looked cool and drink prices were reasonable. The menu could use some tweaking especially in the non-fried food, vegetarian options. A welcome addition to Fremont Street. \n\nYelp 100 Challenge"

I loved how it was right across the street from the bus stop and also the fact that it's on Fremont Street made the place was easy to find.  It was a beautiful day outside when I went so I decided to sit out on their Patio (http://bit.ly/1neEIIF).\n\nLet's get to the food.  Basically I heard about their Philly Mac and Cheese Steak and saw some pics of it on yelp.  So I wanted to give it a go just because of how crazy good it looked.\n\nPhilly Mac and Cheese Steak. --  http://bit.ly/1mfuMNf\nThin sliced sirloin with bell peppers and onions, topped with mac & cheese.\nOn paper, the Philly Mac & Cheese Steak sounds over the top delicious.  But overall it was really dry.  I think mine could've used a lot more cheese sauce.  That probably would've made it a lot better.  Nice try though!  The side of sweet potato tots were good though and I'm glad they threw in some honey mustard dipping sauce for it.\n\nService was really good here.  My waitress was really friendly and enthusiastic and always checked on me.  But then again, I was the only customer out on the patio at the time.  I could imagine things getting a little hectic later in the day and at night especially.  No complaints from me though, my server was awesome!\n\nI'm more than likely going to come back to Park on Fremont again since I'm a huge sucker for Gastropubs and their menu has a lot more interesting dishes I'd like to try like their Mac & Cheese Balls, Garbage Fries, Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich, and Bacon Wrapped Corn Dogs.

            "review": "I really love everything that's going on around East Fremont; with all of the new bars and restaurants the scene is really coming together. But along with all those new venues comes droves of hipsters almost as intolerable to me as the droves of tourists on the Strip, so I tend to visit this area during the day for lunch and weeknights. My impatience aside, the downtown area needs great food to go with its great bars, so I was very excited to hear that the new Park on Fremont was going to be serving more than just snacks. Billed as a gastro-pub, this recently abused word suggests a fancy array of snacks and main dishes to go along with a large drink menu. But can this suggestion truly become a reality?\n\nPark has recently opened, taking over the failed 18+ hookah lounge that was there previously in a prime location on the corner of East Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd. It sits alongside another neighborhood newcomer Radio City Pizza, and all of the other popular First Friday spots that have quickly taken over the scene with long pretentious lines to get in. I hate waiting to get in to places on the Strip, this new development of ropes and lines on Fremont is a bit much, even as 'cool' as some of these places might be. The interior of Park is quite odd, and I'm not quite sure how to explain it. Striking wall coverings, cool art, and stuffed birds decorate the interior dining and bar area, with a small patio up front and a large outdoor 'park' in the back complete with an adult teeter totter and plenty of lights. I went during the day so the inside was more than fine, although I'm sure the outdoor area in the back looks much better at night. While their menu has some interesting sounding items, it's kind of all over the place and I've heard most sound better than they actually taste. Options like a fried chicken and waffle sandwich, Philly mac and cheese steak and a corned beef Reuben all sound tasty, if not unhealthy.\n\nEither way, I'm not here to report second hand information, I'm here to tell you about my burger experience. And in this case, it's their stuffed burger with Monterey jack and cheddar, and applewood bacon. Upon picking it up I bit into my dry bun with a really cold spot in the center where the pickles were sitting. What's with all the cold buns lately? The meat had no decent flavor on its own; it wasn't bad but it wasn't seasoned or presumably anything special. There was surprisingly some pink to the meat, which is a rare sight for a stuffed burger given how much longer they usually have to be cooked, although given the unknown quality of the meat I'm not sure if this is a good thing. The bacon inside was soggy and took away from any cheese or onion flavors, which weren't anything too great either. The lettuce, tomato and onion on top were fresh and ok, but overall there was nothing special about this burger which was surprisingly dry despite being stuffed with so much.\n\nThe fries were nothing special either; of the larger cut variety, but soggy and barely at room temperature. It seems like the reports I've heard are true: everything here looks way better than it actually is, which is surely unfortunate as I really want everything that opens in this particular area to be great. Still, I'm sure it will do just fine as this food is probably more than acceptable for the drunk crowd that takes over East Fremont all weekend. Just not for the overly critical like myself. $12 for a stuffed burger and fries is a reasonable price, I just wouldn't recommend it when you have better options close by at Triple George and newly opened La Comida (review for their really good burger coming next week)."

Throughout the night several of my guests had to refill their drinks at the bar because the waitress either never came to the table, forgot the drink or failed to see our several attempts at waiving her down. Waitress was not interactive and didn't seem happy to be at work.\n\nOnce again they ran out of advertised pickled eggs for the Derby Breakfast Club :(\nAnd the lettuce in my  Strawberry Salad didn't have a clean taste to it. I really think that the owner should be taste testing the food regularly because everything is pretty bland. The price of this place is good but the food should be amazing!\n\nThe appearance/concept of this place is amazing! The designer of this place did an awesome job. As a customer, I think the back yard needs more lights against the walls."

It was Friday and this was the third or fourth stop of the night. I just had to break our one drink per bar rule because the drinks were so good! My favorite was the pillowtalk. It was a light girly drink and I wasn't sure if I tasted any alcohol, but that could've been because I was already drunk. \n\nThis place reminded me of Alice in Wonderland meets the Secret Garden. It was very cute. There's also a hidden smoking area where they have a teeter-totter which is pretty much always occupied. Most people were hanging out in the outdoor area rather than the inside bar area. Crowd was friendly and chill. It was one of the slower bars we went to compared to the other ones on that street. Loved the atmosphere though."

Indoor wait for two was about 20-30 minutes, and the bar top was full. \n\nDecor: Really cute spot. Quirky wallpaper, lots of random chandeliers, old vintage chairs outside. The outdoor space (like someone else mentioned) really is like a work of art. There's a carriage above the famous neon sign. So random, but adds character to the space. I would like my backyard to be as fun as this place. There's also a hidden seesaw and a few more seats behind the fireplace. \n\nFood: I had the chicken and waffle sandwich with sweet potato tater tots. It came with syrup and another sauce (I can't quite place it, but it was amazing). Food was hot and freshly cooked, flavorful, and filling. I also had the cold brew with it. \n\nService: Attentive and quick. No complaints!"

On Saturday 4/26/15, my two gay friends and I ate at the bar here and had 2 drinks each. Once we signed the bill and paid, the security guard asked us to leave. I said, \"Excuse me? Are we being kicked out?\" And he said yes. I asked him why and he looked a little embarassed and immediately said \"Would you like to talk to my manager?\" And I said yes. So a woman came up to me saying someone complained about us. I asked what the complaint was and she said someone was offended by us. I asked what we said or did that was offensive and she could not tell me. In the mean time there was a group of college kids with LSU t-shirts next to us cheersing shots and being very loud, and yet MY small group of 3 people who ate dinner and had 2 drinks was being asked to leave for being offensive! I couldn't believe it. And especially with no explanation. I will NEVER go back there and I tell all friends and family to stay away. Our waitress was nice, even the security guard that was asked to kick us out was nice, but the woman who said she was the manager was the one I blame for the offensive treatment."

It really is aboout time someone made a great version, or 5, of my favorite drink. I had been wanting to try this place knowing it was the sister of Commonwealth, but after reading Misti Y.'s review and learning of the drink menu I knew I had to get here ASAP! \nThey have a few seating options, front patio- (you can see everyone walking down Fremont GREAT people watching). Inside- (dim, bar, tables, booth and awesome photography all over). Back Patio (garden, cool yet strange decor, secret hidden area with a seesaw that you can actually use). The only downfall to the back patio is the scent of trash. They are in the back alley and the dumpster makes its appearance known. They try to hide the scent by burning incense but it doesn't do it 100%.\nThe drinks are $10 each, with the exception of one bloody mary that comes with bacon and an egg. That one is $12. \nI tried 2 different versions. The first was the Texas Tuxedo infused with cucumber and basil. It was more refreshing than your average mary. The second was a Lady Cave which was pretty much a classic served with celery and I added olives. \nI will be risky next time and try the whiskey mary. Didn't want to mix my liquors too early on this trip. \nFood was 3 outta 5 stars. I had the hammered chicken which was a chicken salad with baby greens, candied nuts and either blue or goat cheese I truly cant remember. Probably because there was so little of it in my salad. It was mostly chicken and lettuce and the chicken was a tad dry. \nMy bf got the ruben, and it was basic but good. \nI want to come back and sit inside and on the front patio so I can experience everything. Also I have heard they have a few new menu items and I have a feeling this place will only improve. Can't wait to come try the rest of the drinks and grub!"

I ordered a bloody Mary and this is where my major problem is, I read menu and I got the bloody Mary that was most expensive mainly because of the description it said fresh mix of tomatoes served with a pickled egg and a extra crispy bacon strip.... not what I got and this disappointed me. Mix is fresh as described and actually very tasty, egg was not pickled it was just a plain boiled egg not what menu said, bacon was cold and not cooked very well nothing crispy about it again made me disappointed. Service it was okay could use to pay a bit more attention to their customers and know more about what they are serving the bartender she lacked at know about the drinks they serve and their specialty beers. Overall not bad but serve what you describe otherwise it's not worth getting drinks there."

We were met with some of the worst service I have ever experienced as a guest at any establishment.\n\nWe were seated outside on their patio just before noon. Our table was slightly sunny, which wasn't a problem for me in the beginning. Our server, Andrea, came over and we ordered a \"patio pounder\" which is an entire bottle of champagne and a craft of OJ for $20, my boyfriend also ordered a coffee. I was stoked.\nAfter a very short time the sun had moved, and left our table in direct sunlight. The both of us started to get very hot and uncomfortable. When our server came over to us again to drop off our drinks we explained our discomfort and asked to be moved to a shady table that had just opened up. She said \"yes, of course\" and happily moved us to the more comfortable table, and took our food orders.\nNot five minutes later the host came up, and plainly said \"you can't stay here, this table is being saved\" and when we expressed that we had just become too hot at our original one all she said in reply was \"oh\" and walked away. \nThe attitude we received was unnecessary. We had not moved tables on our own, we asked our server, who had no problem moving us. All we wanted was to sit at a table where we could comfortably enjoy our brunch. I do not think it was an outrageous request. \n\nAfter (embarrassingly) moving back to our original sunny table, we received our food. I ordered French toast and my boyfriend got the breakfast skillet. Our food was GREAT. Let me repeat that: OUR FOOD WAS GREAT. This may have been some of the best French Toast I have ever had.\nBut after we received our food our server Andrea was nowhere to be found.\nThroughout the rest of our meal she came to our table only twice. Once right after we received our food (obviously due to the \"two bite rule\") and once more, in passing, to ask if my boyfriend needed more coffee, after we were almost finished with our meal. She did not even drop off our check herself.\nI would not have been so upset by this if I hadn't heard her chatting excitedly with the table next to us. We can only assume that her terrible attitude was due to her assuming she would not receive a tip from us after we were told (not asked... told) to move tables.\n\nI do not know what exactly the staff here at Park on Fremont think customer service is. But it is definitely NOT treating your guests like they are an inconvenience or not worth your time and attention.\n\nI will not be returning to Park on Fremont until I hear that the staff has had a makeover. The food was amazing, but not good enough to make me want to have a horrible experience like that ever again."

We had a make-your-own burger and kale salad.  Both were as good as you'll get anywhere around town.  But the problem with the location is the $3-4 upcharge on all meals when the meal is worth as much as a non-Fremont meal.  The beer also stood at around $1-2 too expensive.  All in all a nice spot to eat if you want to people watch, but there are better restaurants within a few blocks that I would recommend over Park for the same price with a more intimate and secluded atmosphere."

Recently, I was downtown for photos and it was about 5 so of course, we needed a place for Happy Hour. \n\nI've always liked the vibe of this place , especially the patio. This most recent visit we sat in the patio and enjoyed the great weather. We shared the chicken bar bites, which were good, and the garbage fries, which were the bomb! Why haven't I had these before?!? My only beef during this visit was that we looked at the happy hour drink menu and were ready to order, but then our server informed us that the list was no longer correct. Oh well! \n\nThat won't keep away though. I'll be back especially for those fries!"

I did like the music and decor but the food + noise makes it a negative for me to actually enjoy hanging here.\n\nOverall I'd say that POF is a great joint to hook up with a friend or 2 over drinks at the bar for about 20 minutes but that's it.... or maybe hang out at the bar for as long as it takes to find an interesting person to leave to another joint with.\n\nAlso parking will cost you $20 and that's just too pricey unless you car pool and split the cost. I got out of paying for it because the lot owner and I have a friend in common which is the guy who helped build common wealth across the street... Hooray for me!"

Ample seating, a fireplace for when it gets a bit chilled out there. \n\nThe service was good enough and most people were very cool.. but I wasn't overly stoked about the food or the food prices. I will most likely give it another go to make sure it wasn't a random situation.. but I am not really rushing back for the food.

We were the 2nd so we got a seat at the bar pretty much as soon as we walked in and conveniently  near the Happy Hour specials sign. However, he failed to serve us in an appropriate time frame. Since he was busy ignoring us we figured we'd ask about the specials and decide what we wanted while we waited for him. We asked the bartender what beers were on special he said they all were. We asked twice, even. They, as well as some of the other bars had a special that included a beer and a shot for $6.00(I believe it was $6.00) Well neither of us are shot people so we just ordered the beer, he said $18.00. I said oh we only get the special if we order a shot? He took a beer away and gave us a bottle of beer and said $20! WTF!! Umm that still doesn't solve the problem. I spoke up and said you said all the beers were on special. He mumbled something but basically used the excuse that they were busy as to why he screwed up our service. I should have told him to shove it and go somewhere else but I didn't, I took the beer and the crappy shot and went on our way. Doubtful that I'll be returning. Poor service, as a bartender you have the power!! Give me the beers you screwed up at the special price listed, you get a bigger tip. You screwed it up after all. The worst part is that he could have cared two craps less that he didn't pay attention, didn't listen and that he screwed it up. Blah!"

It wasn't overly crowded but busy enough to get the feeling that Park on Fremont is the place to be. Ambiance is all types of adorable.  Quite eclectic, actually. Inside, there are booths and tables and a good size bar area.  There are rustic chandeliers hanging in the hallway that leads to the outside patio. Cool pictures and paintings hang from the wall as well as antique plates and saucers. \n\nMy favorite part of Park on Fremont is their outside patio area. They have good picnic table seating for the size of the patio. There are cute lights all over the place - on the walls, in the tree. Awesome sign that says \"F*cking Beautiful\" (I think everyone should take a picture in front of this green neon sign!). When the weather is perfect and you're around fun people, the patio is where it's happening!\n\nI had one of their refreshing cocktails, the \"Pillow Talk\". This is so yummy! Cucumbers, strawberries, orange, mint and lemon mixed with soda and some alcohol/liquor (I forget, I'm sorry!) makes this drink in a mason jar perfect for a summer night! I saw that other people were ordering shots and those come in mini mason jars as well. Love! \n\nMy two gal pals and I ordered a small chocolate cheesecake dessert that came in a shot glass. This stuff is super rich, super sweet, super delish. Don't let the size fool  you - bigger is not always better. \n\nFrom what I hear, their food is so-so. But the ambiance and the drinks are so awesome that food or no food, I'll be coming back in the near future."

It was Halloween night and me and my coworkers wanted to have a nice night out so we chose to have a quick late meal here paired with drinks. Later they wanted to go home so we said our goodbyes at the front then needed to use the restroom so proceeded to the front doors. I noticed the security guard arguing with my friend who politely mentioned she needed to use the restroom and was a paying customer and he loudly made a scene about how they were closed and mocked her.  \nAll while the manager was standing near, not doing anything. I understand it was getting late and close to closing time but it was around 2:30am mind you, they close at 3am plus there were about 20 something people inside the establishment. Soon after we ended up using restroom and I noticed people at the back courtyard area so I didn't see a big deal to step foot and show my friend the seesaw room really quick. We found a nice guy who was with his group of friends and asked him to take a photo. But was immediately interrupted by the woman manager who seemed to follow us and said we cannot take the photo and demanded us to leave. How spiteful of her to choose to pick on us in front of other guests. The guy holding my camera was flabbergasted at the manager and said \"that was really rude,\" and took the photos of us anyway. I just wanted to show my friend a room she's never seen before and figured it would change her upset mood over the security guard incident. And didn't see the big deal of taking a quick look before we headed out, in addition there were still a lot people! The manager threatened to call metro, we were so polite I didn't feel that was necessary. Not even 3am yet. Both the security guard and manager felt the need to argue with us and make a seen in front of other paying customers. Had they known we are in the hospitality business too, I've also written content about Las Vegas venues and \"Things to Do\" around Vegas, and my friend was looking into Park for her wedding reception, would they have treated us better? Regardless, you don't treat others this way."

The Strip is what most people think of when they think of Vegas: Showy, glamourous, bright lights, etc, but Downtown has been undergoing a quiet revival in the last few years. Sure it still has the marks of \"old Vegas\" and has yet to be completely cleaned up or even gentrified, but it's become home to some drinking establishments that are actually pretty unique, my favourite among them being one of the newer kids on the block, Park on Fremont. Situated in the hip and trendy East Fremont district, which is home to many bars, Park on Fremont is a grand exercise in the power of kitsch and how awesome it looks and feels. Not only is it one of the only watering holes in the area that is open during the day, but it's also got a pretty good food menu, decent drinks and a wonderful atmosphere. In fact, it's a great place to go if you want to feel like you're not really in Vegas at all.\n\nThings of note: The gigantic, and incredibly authentic, Mark Ryden painting, $20 bottomless mimosas for Sunday brunch (and we all know how I love my mimosas), the hidden teeter totter out on the patio.\n\nMake sure to try: $10 beer and a shot menu, Pillow Talk."

It was macaroni balls which the server recommended. They were pretty good. Would have been even better before the entr\u00e9e.\n\nThis restaurant has a lot of potential, but they need to work out their service issues first."

This is the spot to resort to when you're trying to escape from the loud thumping music or the obnoxious young \"I wanna get drunk!\" crowd Downtown tends to attract with their newest attractions. (God I sound old when I said that)\n\nPark is low-key. You can actually enjoy cocktails (I advise you to try a Bloody Mary) or the usual call drinks and beers while being able to conversate with your friends no matter where you're at. Whether you're in the front lawn people watching or in the back cozying up next to the fireplace or on the see-saw, Park definitely recreates a different setting in comparison to the other bars on Fremont Street. I LOVE AND PREFER IT, especially when you're actually trying to catch up with your friends while being hungry at the same time.\n\nAnd yes, this place offers food! I've had a couple things off their menu and everything is mediocre at it's finest but very good at the moment when you're trying to sober up. I wouldn't ever come here just for the food (in my opinion) but this is the place I'd choose to be Downtown if my friends left it up to me.\n\nI'm starting to assume Park is never as crowded as the other places due to the prices but hey, I wouldn't mind spending an extra buck or two keeping my sanity than to fight over a place to stand avoiding my drink to be spilled due to some intoxicated bimbo trying hard to seem sober while navigating to the bathroom every hour. And you know how they say \"You are who you surround yourself with\"? Well Park is definitely my kind of the socializing in a sophisticated yet fun manner crowd. \n\nPS: Four stars for the lack of service since it's not as attentive as a service establishment should be and more of a \"let me take your order and dip\" without checking back to see if we want another round which steers us to overcrowd the bar instead. I hate to be that person that does that but when your server is close to nonexistent then you're left with no other choice. Sorry."

The theme and decor seems the same (night time parkesque with urban touch) on both ends and struck me more as a prefunk joint prior to clubbing.  One thing that differntiated each other was that the one in New York was way bigger and two (and a half??) stories tall and had a dinner/lounge area on the first floor and a dancefloor/ultralounge motif on the upper level.  While Park on Fremont looked to be more of a gastropub.  \n\nI am no expert on the phenomenon and far from someone who can define a gastropub, but all the gastropubs that I have visited all seem to serve unique drinks or craft beers along with typical food with an eccentric twist, oh yeah, they all seem to right their menu down on chalkboards I found...almost like a bar on steroids if you will.\n\nTo support my claim, I had the mac and cheese Philly sandwich to go along with a   Sierra Nevada Kellerweis Hefe while my then fiance had the chicken and waffles sandwich (the unicorn I think it was called??) to go with some type of old fashioned cocktail.  I wasn't crazy about the food, but they get a good grade for effort I suppose.  \n\nWhat I find most appealing about Park is that it is part of the whole \"Hsieh Downtown Revival Movement.\"  It offers a new dimension to this growing artsy district, each establishment complimenting one another.  I draw the line right at LVB, everything West of that street is ol' school downtown casinos and bars, while everything East of that street is everything else I am all about.  \n\nPark is well positioned and if I had to map my map of attack on a nightly basis, it would most likely start with a Sazerac at Downtown Cocktail Lounge, then Park for a beer and a snack (cushion), jump into either the Grif for a goblet of Delerium or Insert Coins (granted they ain't tryna be stingy at the line), slide through to Beauty Bar to get some fat shots then have a contest of some sort to see who will stand in line at the Commonwealth while the rest of the gang stays refreshed at the Vanguard.  Yep, that's a well planned strategy if I must say so myself.\n\nSo again, Park plays an intricate role in the inner workings of the downtown scene and provides a different flavor amongst the many the area has to offer.  Had the food been better, I could see myself giving a higher rating, but overall not a bad spot at all."

I ordered their garbage tots and they tasted good. Small portion though.. I was expecting them to be a bit bigger for $13. Definitely would go back with a group of friends just to chat though!"

We dined outside and the view outside is great people-watching.\n\nI ordered ahi tuna appetizer which was very yummy, just the right amount of food. Only complaint I have is the tuna was a smidge fatty. Seasoned nicely and had a little salad w light vinaigrette dressing and avocado.\n\nMy friends split a burger and fries and they cleaned their plates.\n\nReasonably priced items and small menu. I shall return."

My friend said she had had the food here and recommended it. Before you walk in, you get attitude from the bouncer. He stared at my ID like it was fake, even flipped it around to check the back in a way that indicated that he didn't think it was real (I'm 24 and don't look underage). Also, ignored my friends request to just see her ID in the wallet.\n\nWe sit in the back patio area and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally I go to the bar and ask the bartender if there's a server that's supposed to come around or if we are supposed to order at the bar. \n\nBartender: \"Did someone sit you down back there?\"\n\nMe: \"No we just sat down back there\"\n\nBartender: \"Oh yeah, if you weren't seated then no server is going to come to you. We don't have servers just walking around\"\n\nMe: \"Can you please send someone out there for us?\"\n\nBartender: \"Sure\"\n\nAnd you know how this ends. No one ever showed up. Plus, walking out, there's a sign that says, \"Please seat yourself.\" So why the bartender thought anyone would sit us down is beyond me. I'm sure the food there is probably okay, but I'll never know.\n\nI won't be going here again, the service is just terrible. I can only imagine how awful it would have been if someone ACTUALLY had taken time to taken our order."

The service,  the drinks, the food......everything was on point!  I raved about it so much that I took a friend, hoping that they would experience the same awesomeness that I had.  Sadly however,  our experience was anything but awesome! While the food and drinks were still good,  the horrible service left a bad taste in our mouths. It kind of came off like the servers had NO IDEA that there were people who wanted to be served. It took them 10-15 minutes to even come over to us and offer us water, then after that  another 10-15 minutes to take our order, food comes out and then I have wait 20 minutes after the food was served for the beer I ordered when they first offered us water. I have no idea what's going on, but poor service really sucks! I'm usually a good tipper, but I'm sorry I can't reward poor service. I hope they get it together, cause I really like their happy hour, garbage fries, and buffalo chicken bites."

Right across from the Fremont experience downtown, Park is perfect for people watching! You will see people of all walks of life doing all kinds d things. You will not get bored... Promise. \n\nThis place is all about the cocktails. I'm talking straight up mixology. The first few times I went and read their cocktail list k thought they were crazy with some of their concoctions...but that is why they're the experts and I'm not. Although they sound like crazy mixtures, their drinks are some of the most delicious drinks I've had here in town.  If you go, the pillow talk is the most refreshing and amazing drink I've had-ever. \n\nThis place is also ultra trendy. You and your friends trying to find someplace new to try that's cool and hip? Suggest this place and your group won't be disappointed. From the second you walk in you know your entering a cool place as the staff is dressed in flannels. Flannels are always a good sign. The decor adds to the cool, unique, and trendy vibe you get. Everything is super bizarre but put together in a way that works. \n\nIf weather permits, I really recommend sitting out on the back patio. Really cool seating and great vibes out there. Also, if you can pull yourself away from your party for long enough there is a \"secret\" seesaw behind the wall with the fireplace in it. Always get good laughs when you take a ride on that thing. \n\nLike I said, this place is all about the scene and the cocktails. That is why they get 4 stars and not 5. Although it's a great place and I will definitely be going back time and time again.... Their food, to me, is just good. Which isn't a bad thing, but I also don't think it's 5 star worthy. Also, their service can be pretty slow. I've only ever had one server there that took care of us at a good rate. Otherwise, I've always been left waiting. Trying to flag down my server to speed the process along. Other than this, though, Park is the place to be! Recommend it.. You won't regret it."

Sadly, the tough steak took away from enjoying my meal. I had a hard time cutting into the slices and chewing, but the marination and flavor of the steak was good. \n\nI think I drank a good 8 mason jars full of mimosas before I could finally get a good buzz. Which made me wonder if they over pour orange juice in it or the champagne isn't as strong as decent champagne usually is. Then again it is $20 bottomless for a reason. \n\nThe place is super hipster and fun, which I love because it does give you something to look at and enjoy while waiting or sitting around. The backyard is super fun! Think the backyard is all there is? Nay! Follow the wonderfully decadent china wall and to the end you'll find a small opening where the fun teeter-totters are hidden! What fun! We had a ball with that one and any person who says they don't teeter-totter, I guarantee you a few mimosas later you'll be riding that thing like charlie brown!\n\nThe service was very attentive always asking how we are doing and constantly refilling our drinks. Sandy they ran out of mimosas right before we could order one last one before it ended, but high tens to the bartender because she was nice enough to give us one last round of shots to end our happy hour. As you may predict, that awesomely tasteful shot that I cannot name had probably been the beginning of a very downward spiral turn of events for that night. Not so much sad turn of events, but more hangover memorable."

This is a great atmosphere, especially when the temps are good to hang out outside. The courtyard like area outside is a perfect spot to go for a chill night out. Also, if you venture a little further outside to the back of the seating area, there's a doorway off the side that leads to a small area with a seesaw. The inside is nice too, but it's definitely a hipster vibe with crazy wallpaper prints and animal heads on the walls. \n\nThe drink prices are pretty comparable to other places downtown, so expect to spend about $7/beer or $8/cocktail. They do have a \"beer and a shot\" deal which recently went up from $10 to $12, but still it's a pretty decent deal. They do have some good beers offered for this deal like Dog Fish Head 90 IPA, and it's not just well alcohol. \n\nI've only been here at night, so I kind of want to see what it's like here during the day because it seems like a nice place to grab a bite of food or drink in the afternoon."

You think the waiters would be walking around with buckets of beers because, obviously, people are going to order a shit-ton of them at a time.  No.  Of course not.  My friend and I ordered four total.  And about 20 minutes later, we got two ... then 20 minutes after that, we got our other two.  Don't forget about the 30 minute wait for our three tacos which should be being made at lightning speed since that's probably the only thing being ordered there on Tuesdays.  \nAlso, the beer taps are really high so hiring petite girls as bartenders probably isn't the wisest decision because all you'll get is foam from the 5 foot long beer pour."

Very mellow vibe, chill atmosphere. Cute patio seating. I recommend ordering the mimosas \" Patio Pounders\". The orange juice was really good and they bring your bottle of Prosecco on ice in this cute clear bag. They bring you some cute small mason jars to sip from. This was my favorite part of the experience. \n\n\nCons: Now, onto the shortcomings. The staff, definitely needs some fine tuning.\nWhen we approached the hostess she seated us immediately, once we were seated on the patio, it took 15-20 min. to take our order. Common, after a long night of drinking in Vegas, we were really hungry! 15-20 min feels like an hour. While waiting for our server, we smelled garbage, i guess it was garbage day in the lot next to the Park. Sitting and waiting on someone to take our order while smelling garbage is a horrible combination. My patiences were being tested at this point. I had to flag down a server to ask where our server was, seems like both servers didn't communicate as to who will serve our table.The food, wasn't anything special. We ordered Chilaquiles-never seen a version like this one before (everything came separated), Mini Corn dogs, Mac & Cheese balls and a burger. It was 3 of us who all ate and shared. The food wasn't as hot as I would like it to be, the oil they used to cook the food tasted old and upset our stomachs. The steak that went with our chilaquiles had a ton of fat on it, was super tough, chips seemed store bought. My friend asked for a diet Coke 2 times, as they forgot to bring it to her twice. We spoke with the manager and told her our concerns she was nice enough to take the items off the bill, I appreciated that. She was very apologetic about the situation.\n\nSummary: Very cute place and has all the potential to be a great restaurant, has the look, but the food needs to be better. Better staff and more staff is need. It's all about ambiance, food and service. They missed the mark on food and service, which so very important in the restaurant biz! Would I go back? Ehhh probably not."

So basically, you're not getting better pricing for happy hour; you're just ordering tapas.\n\nOn previous trips, we've tried the chilaquiles (enormous portion, and really good!!); the San Diego burger (my dining mate scarfed it before I could try a bite, & says it was also really good); the chicken bar bites (if chickens had cojones the size of a great Dane, that's what these are -- no bite-sized bites here!); and the Philly mac & cheese sandwich (decently good, though I was expecting more mac & cheese... the other Yelp pics showed much more than we got on that trip). Based on all of those, and the service, which is normally pretty friendly and mostly timely, I'd give a 4.\n\nThis last trip, the waitress started out friendly until we expressed amused disgruntlement at the \"happy hour,\" and thereafter she was nothing but flat-lined personality with us, although I went out of my way to be upbeat & friendly with her. Apart from that, we ordered the fried pickles (which we've had before -- pretty tasty! They're cut into slices and are interspersed with fried pepperoncinis, too, as well as sometimes a whole jalape\u00f1o!), and we were excited to try the Cuban sandwich and the garden burger.\n\nThe Cuban was the most uninspired version of that meal that either of us had ever tasted -- the bread wasn't grilled & pressed, and somehow they took most of the flavor out of this inherently tasty mix of ingredients. The garden burger was the most bland veggie burger I've ever had (and that's saying something). Looking at the patty, it looks like it should be good, since you can see some black beans & tiny pieces of colorful veggies, but it seems like they used zucchini, maybe (or some other filler/black hole of flavor), for the rest of the patty, so the flavors were stretched too thin. They topped it with tomato, cucumber (which I love in the right context, but in this case it also just added to the blandness), and arugula (which, normally tasty, just got swallowed up by the blander ingredients as well). The super light basting of the chipotle mayo-like topping could barely be noticed. If I had to eat this dish again, I'd order an extra side of the stuff & slather it on to see if it made a difference. To get an idea of what a really awesomely executed veggie burger / bean patty tastes like, go to R\u00ed R\u00e1.\n\nAs a general note, the accompaniments for most sandwich & burger items are either fries (the seasoning is really good, and the ketchup is slightly spicy, yum!!), sweet sweet potato tots (that other \"sweet\" is in there for a reason -- they're topped with cinnamon/sugar, & while they're good, if you like sweet potatoes, we both felt they'd be better served as a dessert rather than a side for a savory dish), and a couple other things we've never bothered to order, I think cole slaw and a side salad. Some day I'll order the side salad to see what their dressing is like, but I'm not a fan of 98% of cole slaws.\n\nWe'll definitely keep coming back & trying the other plates Park has to offer, but we'll be avoiding the \"happy hour\" menu and those last two offerings. It feels claustrophobic sitting inside, but both patios are nice!"

It is NOT one of yours or your other customer RIGHTs to NOT be offended. You are a BAR. Nothing more, Nothing less. You are going to get all kinds of people with all kinds of opinions. Democrats/Republicans. Liberals/Conservatives. \nIts not your job to moderate these people or their comments/conversations. Your job is to shut up and serve drinks and food. \nConcentrate on that."

And serving as somewhat of a gateway between these two vastly different parts of Downtown Las Vegas is Park on Fremont. The large draft craft beer selection and small bites of re-imaged pub fare screams hipster gastropub, but it's just as common to see a couple of \"regular folks\" wander over from the Fremont Experience to grab a NASCAR brew and a shot. And their extensive bottle selection goes from numerous west coast craft brews to bottles of Mickey's.  \n\nMy first trip to Park was in Vegas last year. I stopped here as a \"beer layover\" on my walk from Container Park back to my hotel at the GN. This was the first place where I tried the awesome Stiegl Grapefruit Radler on tap. I didn't eat, although I REALLY wanted to come back for the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak. It sounds like such an atrocity for a cheesesteak purist like myself, but it had my curiosity peaked.\n\nI did make it back to Park during my most-recent trip, but it was late-night and I just didn't have the hunger for something that large. Thankfully they had late-night happy hour, and their awesome Garbage Fries for $5. Topped with cheese, bacon, avocado, chipoltes, jalapenos, tomatoes, green onions, and fried egg for good measure ... it may look like \"garbage\" but it tasted delicious. \n\nPark on Fremont is a place I want to continue coming back to each time I'm in Downtown LV. I've got to try the cheesesteak, and I still haven't checked out their patio yet. (Which looks awesome from the photos) It's worth the short venture off the \"Downtown Strip\"."

A co-worker recommended Park on Fremont for great drinks and food in downtown LV.  He was spot on.  The drink menu is great - I couldn't resist the Unicorn (ginger beer, absolut citron, mint, simple syrup, Im missing something...) which was a little sweet but easy drinking.  My friends opted for the shot and beer. The food was pretty damn good, too.  They offer a great variety of options for carnivores and vegetarians.  I tried the veggie sliders and sweet potato tots.  The sliders were very good with whole wheat buns and a great citrus sauce.  The tots are very different that regular tater tots - sweet sprinkled with cinnamon and very reminiscent of doughnuts.  I'm on the fence about 'em.  I just wasn't in the mood for sweet, should have ordered fries instead to satisfy that craving.  The sriracha/ketchup blend was a perfect accompaniment to the tots, a little spice and a ton of flavor really balanced the sweetness of the tots.\n\nA great alternative to the usual douchy LV Strip bars.  The atmosphere is great, lots of locals and a younger crowd, outdoor seating.  Great art, a ton of stuffed birds behind the bard, and a beautiful Mark Ryden print by the kitchen.  Super friendly staff.\n\nOur waitress couldn't have been better.  She was super nice and very attentive, gave us her recommendations, which we tried, and was just overall fantastic.  I didn't catch her name but I wish I had so I could properly compliment her service (petitie asian gal with a bright, friendly smile)."

When my husband went to the bar to ask for a cup, the bartender was rude and said the dishwasher was broken!

I'm starting to see a trend on East Fremont...subpar service and seemingly a bit of collusion amongst the other establishments.  Did you all get together and decide that the average price for a quality beer is going to be 8-10 bucks and that PBR will be 2 dollars?  \n\nThe decor in the bar is pretty cool with interesting stuff to look at. They also have a decent selection of micro brews from out of state, both bottled and draft.  Service this night was a very slow start.  I sat at the bar inside for nearly 15 minutes before being greeted.  Finally someone came over and expressed surprise nobody had taken care of me yet.  Umm, you're one of the ones ignoring me too, haha!  After the slow start, service was OK...basically what I've come to expect on this block in Vegas...not great, just OK.  Are all of the bartenders on this block newbs?  Me thinks so.  Call center tech support by day, attempting bartending by evening is my guess.\n\nAnyway...for dinner I had the Philly Mac and Cheese.  What's that you ask...well it's their version of a Philly cheesesteak with mac and cheese plopped on top. I was skeptical to say the least but figured what the heck I'll give it a shot.  So, I'm from Philly...doesn't compare at all but the added mac and cheese on top made it unique enough that I would recommend trying it and may even order that again myself. \n\nMy plea to all owners and managers on East Fremont:  figure out a way to get your staff to be on point.  The trendiness of your location only goes so far; repeated subpar service will drive your clientele away in the long term."

Clearly the sort of place where cuisine is considered less important than booze and d\u00e9cor suffice it to say that the beer list and creative cocktails far outnumber the options for food and even with the extended brunch menu it was only in three items that myself and a friend could muster enough interest to indulge, the plates arriving in two rounds as we sat amidst a room awash in faux-taxidermy and paintings ranging from humping animals to possessed children with neither rhyme nor reason to be found.  Opting for one starter to precede a duo of entrees it would not be long before the best bites of the meal would arrive and served as a quintet the Mac & Cheese balls each proved not only sizable but also quite delicate, the crackling panko overlying supple pasta with briny bits of bacon imbuing each bite plus a sidecar of cheese sauce for those desiring even more cream.  At this point happily conversing about recent events as background music played on it was after only the slightest of delays that three trays would arrive and with the kitchen opting to split our French Toast while the sandwich was served whole it can only be said that neither dish tasted as good as it looked, the brioche too lightly soaked and thinly sliced to allow the exterior to be rendered crisp without burning it while the waffle was chewy and lifeless, a bready detriment to otherwise pleasant chicken and bacon served alongside entirely forgettable, yet all too trendy, 'tots.'\n\nNot exactly a disaster in that the service was pleasant while the Mac & Cheese Balls were far better than standard pub-grub suffice it to say that for those not interested in being upsold on cleverly named cocktails or craft beers Park on Fremont has little to offer - a quick walk down the street to MTO, eat, S+O, Carson Kitchen, or DuPar's offering far more extensive selection with equal or better value on the dollar at each."

First, they have an outdoor seating area with live acoustic music -- Nice touch!! Then they have a great selection of unusual beers. I had the Francknerwizzunsumpthing Heff-- I actually dont remember what its name was but I had two of them and these were among the best beers I had during the entire stay in Vegas. My main dinner course was a sandwich called \"Philly Mac and Cheesesteak\". This was INCREDIBLE!!!! The ambience is totally there. They even have a teeter-totter (see-saw) there for no reason except to have fun. I would absolutely return here."

We all ordered one of the signature cocktails that were 10 $ a peice. When Bailey our serve brought them out to us we thought she was kidding. The drinks are served in tiny mason jars probably about 6oz. Her response was they had alot of booze. Well, I had the stranger danger which tasted like watered down ice tea. The wombat tasted like grapefruit juice and actually had a peice of glass in the drink. The manager did come over and bought another drink to correct the mistake. After drinks we started with the mac balls. Then we ordered dinner the chicken and waffle sandwich(the chicken was horribly dry), steak salad (I literally had 3 thin slices of steak on my salad) the chicken balls (again dry) and the ribs ( again over cooked). So our food comes out and Baily has forgotten the mac balls. 10 mins later with dinner almost done we get the mac balls. BEST PART OF THE WHOLE EXPERINCE! They were so good. When every one finishes we ask for the check to be split in half with 2 credit cards. Some how this gets screwed up and ends up taking us 10mins just to pay for our dinner. Point blank I wouldn't go back. The food was all over cooked, the drinks are poor quality and over priced."

            "review": "I've been to Park two times since it opened. The first time it was amazing, the weather was nice since we got there around 7pm. Ambiance is amazing and quaint and I really want this place to do well so that is why I'm writing this review. \n\nThe second time I went there I went around 12:30pm and asked to sit on the back patio. That was a mistake because the sun was blazing hot and there were no umbrellas, fans, or misters. It's not even summer yet and the outside will miserably fail if something isn't done to change that. So everyone was moving tables and switching spots to avoid the sun. \n\nWhich brings me to another problem that Park probably won't be able to fix as easily ... The patio side is up against an alley, where all the trash from surrounding bars is dumped. In the sun, the smell was so horrible I felt like I was going to throw up, I don't know how they're going to fix that issue. But you can't expect to serve food to people when they're smelling rotting trash. Revolting. \n\nThen, we ordered the Mac n cheese Philly and the bar chicken bites... But it took 55 minutes for the food to come out at 45 minutes for anyone to realize there was an issue with our order. A manager never stopped by to apologize and at the end of the meal they removed one item from our bill. \n\nI've worked in the hospitality industry for over ten years. I know it's not all the waitresses fault, however managers need to be more aware of what's going on in their restaurant. (I saw them dealing with contractors so I'm assuming they were preoccupied) ..regardless, get ON your kitchen and get the food out! The servers need to be aware of their surroundings, one girl passed us literally ten times and after we had already been waiting for food for 30+ minutes she asked if anyone has taken our order yet. \n\nI want this place to do well so badly and I'm hoping this review can be used to fix these problems for the future.  \n\nOne star for my previous positive experience, no stars for the remaining issues."

It's another one of the finds in Vegas that gives me a feeling of being back at home in Columbus (OH)! Some may describe it has \"Hipster\" - and rightfully so... just don't grab from that, that it's Snobby Hipster. Park on Fremont is the approachable Hipster. The Hipster with an Android phone. The Hipster that doesn't quite commit to riding bicycles EVERYWHERE and sometimes grabs an Uber. \n\nPark is pretty small inside, so plan to venture outdoors as there is plenty of outdoor seating. But if you sit inside, avoid that back booth, unless you've got really small thighs. I mean REALLY small thighs. My friends and I once sat in that back booth and we had a hard time getting in/out. The bar is pretty cool though and the bartenders all seem pretty cool as well. \n\nMy favorite thing about Park, aside from the chicken and waffle sandwich, is the secret garden in the back... so be sure to explore your surroundings! \n\nI've ordered a cheeseburger and fries, chicken and waffle sandwich and wings and fries. Park has some of the best French fries! They're always the right amount of crisp. The cheeseburger was pretty standard, but the wings I had ordered really surprised me. The Chipotle BBQ sauce that they used is really good! Not too much of a kick but just enough to leave you wanting more. \n\nMy absolute FAVORITE dish there though is the Chicken and Waffle sandwich. It's pretty big so bring your appetite if you're going to be ordering this dish. There is a fried chicken breast nestled between two waffles and some bacon. The chicken is the perfect amount of crispy and juicy. You also get syrup which makes the waffle easier to bite into. You have your choice of a side, I've (so far) gotten it with a salad and sweet potato tots. Go with the tots, they're pretty darn good as well! \n\nPark has an awesome (brunch) drink special - $20 for a bottle of champagne and enough orange juice to make quite a few mimosas out of. So if you're looking for a downtown brunch spot to drink, go to Park!"

I went to Vegas with some girlfriends for a long weekend and this was our last stop on our way out of town for brunch. It had great reviews and the photos looked fantastic but our meals were very lackluster. Three of us ordered huevos rancheros and although the menu said there would be chorizo, we couldn't find any. It was basically an uncooked corn tortilla with beans and avocado. Not really what huevos rancheros are, or what we were expecting from the description. Our other issue was that our waitress never asked if we wanted the bill split and when we asked if we could do it she said it could only be split 3 ways (there were 8 of us) and that we needed to mark the receipt how we wanted it split. We were annoyed but we made do. When we got the bills literally each one was messed up and we had to all pay each other the differences anyways. \n\nIn summary: not worth the hype."

I looked them up on Facebook and I loved the photos they had on there and decided to follow them on Twitter. We came here last night (Saturday night) around 10PM and we were greeted by the tall bouncer who checked our ID's, and two hostesses. We had a choice to eat inside or outside and we chose inside. We were seated right at the very first table, across from the bar. I liked where we sat as the booth was very comfortable and I got a good view of the bar and they had some very interesting decor. The whole place had great decor. It was kinda dark and loud where we sat but I got used to it after a while.\n\nWe sat for a few minutes when Jose (I'm guessing a manager) came over and introduced himself to us and told us that our waitress would be over soon. In less than a minute, our waitress came over and she was so sweet. I didn't catch her name but she's a pretty, petite, blond wearing a thin headband. I ordered the Banana Beer and the Chicken Bar Bites, and my boyfriend wanted the grilled cheese but they were all out of that so he got the Chicken Bar Bites instead. For his beer, he ordered Red Stripe but the waitress came back and said that they were all out of it, and because of that, the manager would buy  him his beer. So the bf named at least 3 more beers that were on the menu but they were all out of the ones he named. Finally he asked the waitress which ones they had and were good and she recommended the Dogfish Head Raison D'etre beer.\n\nI absolutely loved my banana bread beer, and my bf enjoyed his beer as well. The chicken bites came with fries and even though the chicken bites looked really plain and simple, it tasted really good. The chicken was juicy and the breading had a slight crunch to it. The fries were ok.\n\nWe will definitely return in the next few weeks as I really want to try their Philly Mac and Cheese Steak, and I'd like to check out their outside patio area.\n\nI would have given them five stars but I deducted one star because they were out of many beers."

The French toast ($10) lacked a good sear and was soggy -- unable to hold up to the custard it was soaked in. Topped with mixed berries, it was an unspectacular dish. Even worse was the fried chicken and waffle sandwich ($11). A thick, oily breading coated strips of breast meat and were sandwiched between soggy waffles. The best of the items we tried were the mac n cheese balls ($8). Five per order and coated in a light layer of panko breadcrumbs, the mac n cheese inside wasn't half bad when compared to the other dishes. \n\nThe almost-garish decor makes for a good conversation starter and photos. Who doesn't want to see a classically painted portrait of a horse mounting another horse? Park on Fremont might even be a good place to grab some drinks, but you should make sure you grab a bite to eat elsewhere."

The food portions are a plenty, so we ended up splitting something plus ordering an appetizer, so there was NO food left! oh and it kind of helped that the food was AMAZING!  We sat outside, but we walked through the inside before we left and fell in love.  next time we are on Fremont street, we know where to hang out for a few drinks before heading to the casino's again.  thanks staff, ya'll were great."

So I had to come back for another.  It was every bit as good as the last, and this time we sat inside, not on the patio.  I love it inside: great juke box, great service, and too many chandeliers in the hallway (and who doesn't love that?) oh yeah, and those filthy birds, my fav!  \nBut on a less positive note, I have never tasted anything else that I liked.  The fried chicken & waffle sandwiches I've eaten both nearly brought tears of joy to my eyes.  The rest of the menu........closer to just plain old tears...\n[Tip:  Avoid the Cuban sandwich: most boring sandwich in captivity.]"

Weird sign on a Friday night on Fremont East.\n2. It was 630pm, and they had a door man in full blacks with a clicking counter and sleazy hairdo.\n3. We waited several minutes to be carded, because this doorman was carding the foursome in front of us that we're all obviously of retirement age or greater.\n4. Once we were carded, there was no recognition of being locals.. inconvenienced locals that live mere blocks away.\n5. The ineffectual hostess sat in front of a sign reading \"Please seat yourself\" while the ineffectual doorman made confusing and unsolicited food suggestions (\"You gotta try that thing with the... umm.. mac and cheese, yeah!\")\n6. Once we had sat ourselves at the outside portion of bar, our unsmiling, but otherwise friendly, bartender came by to get our order.\n7. He did apologize for being out of cherries for our cherry cokes. \n8. Food took 30+ minutes despite low guest count.\n9. The ahi tuna \"salad\" was not a salad at all. It was 7 lovely and pretty perfectly seared slices of ahi, 3 slices of Hass avocado, 3 forkfuls of spring mix with a little too much dressing, and a drizzle of a sauce I couldn't put my finger on. Not bad at all, but should have been offered on the appetizer menu and not described as a salad.\n10. Fiancee's Cajun chicken sandwich and fries were delicious. The roll was fresh, the fries were as good as ever, and the chicken cooked through but not dry. We will order this again.\nOverall I took a star for this review because of this lackluster experience this time. I will hopefully give them their star back next time!"

It's dark, mysterious, charming, just so cute.\nAs far as drinks, I've had the bloody mary which is very good! The drink menu is unique and after sips of my friends' drinks, it's not bad at all. \nThe food is also quite good. I recommend the chilaquiles. \nOf course as a new place downtown, it isn't cheap. The food is small portioned so I would only go on a nice night on the town with friends, not when I'm terribly hungry or just as a random night to go have dinner. It's definitely more of a place to socialize than to feel stuffed after dinner.\nThe reason why I'm giving it a \"meh\" rating is because the service took WAY too long. I took my sister who's from out of town so the only reason we didn't mind the wait was because we had so much catching up to do.\nI went on a random Monday at 4pm...not peak hours at all. We ordered drinks, that look 20 minutes to come, ordered some sides, another 25 minutes, my boyfriend asked for ranch...that took 15 minutes-he was basically done eating by the time she brought the ranch! Another 30 minutes and she finally comes back and we ask for the check. Another 15 go by and our server never came. We actually had to request another server to take our tab up to be paid so we could leave.\nWhen we first got there, there were 3 parties including us so it really should not have taken as long as it did.\nDon't get me wrong, the servers are very sweet. But the wait for the smallest things was ridiculous so come with time on your hands. I actually went on a busy Friday night and the service was much faster then when there was a FULL house than tonight on a random Monday afternoon with just a few people there.\nBut I do love the ambiance, the originality of the drinks, and the food so I'll be back."

Your response has two major lies.  #1 that my comments were very public, this was not the case in the least! The only person that could have heard us was your out of line bartender. #2 that my comments were disparaging towards LGBT.  Absolute lie! My comments were about why LGBT community continues to defend muslims when muslims would throw you/them off buildings. If that offends then you need to learn about logic. Stop with the cry baby nonsense and stop creating lies to justify the bad treatment I received. I'm wondering if Park at Fremont is part of the militant gay community and is all about shaming rather than open conversation.  I really feel for the poor innocent people at the Florida club who were massacred by a true LGBT hater last night. I'm curious if your bartender would stand up against the Muslim who killed these innocent people or only the harmless guy having a drink at your bar conversing with a friend? #realcourage"

I understand that NYE/NY is stressful time being at work (or in general working in a place like Las Vegas) but wow.\n\nWe arrived with our group of friends (who had just gotten married that day by the way). We wanted to sit outside and out waitress told us that it is \"no problem\" and \"we get the heaters for you, I'll come back when you have all settled.\"\nThere was a guy who was dealing with the heaters and one of the guys in our group asked \"How long is it going to take, we are freezing? Just wondering if you need any help...?\" The guy didn't say anything so we just assumed he was okay.\n\nService was good, food was good and we tipped above average.\n\nWhen it was time to leave, two people from our group decided to have two shots (hello, they got married that day! Why not? :) ) \n\nThis was when the \"fun\" begun.\n\nThe bartender told them \"I don't serve you anymore. Get out of here.\" Our friends were like \"Excuse me? Why?\"\n\nThe next thing he did was that he asked the security guy to walk them out. Our friends asked again \"Why?\" since no one had said anything or done anything that would have been consider hurtful or out of order. \n\nThe security guy had a HUGE ATTITUDE problem and after few rants he PHYSICALLY grab  one of the girls (waist) and tried to push her out. When her boyfriend was trying to tell him that he is not allowed to touch anyone (especially since she didn't even said anything, just stood there not understanding what's going on) the security guy said; \"I CAN DO WHAT EVER I WANT TO IN MY BAR.\"\n\nWhen another person from our group went to the guy asking what is going on he said to her that \"oh bitch, you are with them too? Get the fuck outta here! You are not welcome.\"\n\nOkay dude calm down. \n\nI feel bad for Park on Fremont that I have to write on Yelp a review since when I tried to complain thru phone the management (or how do I know if it was management after all, I wouldn't be surprise that it was the same guy who was working on the bar that night ha!) wasn't heard at all.\n\n\nI would love to have some sort of response and APOLOGY.

The Mac n Cheese balls were golf ball sized scoops of panko crusted, deep fried mac n cheese with jalapeno and bacon too boot.  One bite of that crispy, creamy goodness and we were transported to mac n cheese heaven.  My wife doesn't even like mac n cheese and I was forced to share them with her cuz they were that darn good LMAO!\n\nThe chicken and waffle sammie holds two deep fried chicken breasts and a healthy portion of crispy bacon.

I can't forget the fact that it resembles a home with its white picket fence in front. It could be their delicious foods and drinks menu because what else would attract you to a place? Or maybe the weird, creep Disney-like decor! Perhaps its all the above combined!\n\nThis restaurant is located right down Fremont St, across from The Griffin and on the same side where Vanguard is. It can get pretty loud depending on the time you go, so if you're planning on going with friends to have some good conversation - I suggest you go on a weekday. Unless you want to be stared down by strangers and have to yell over the table, then by all means.. Come here on a weekend night.\n\nThey have a small menu, but it works! We went here with some friends so we were recommended items prior to even coming here. We started off their Chicken Wings (1 lb) and asked for the sauce on the size. These were delicious, but then again.. I've never came across a bad serving of Chicken Wings. Our main course consisted of sharing a Philly Mac and Cheese Steak (it is definitely share-worthy) alongside Garbage Fries. The meal was more than satisfying, but can I just rave for a second on their Garbage Fries?! I know it doesn't sound appealing, but their Garbage Fries consist of everything GARBA-licious smacked right on top of fries. I mean... cheddar and provolone cheese, bacon, jalape\u00f1os, green onions, tomatoes, peppers, avocados, and an egg! I probably will never not order their Garbage Fries when coming here. I feel like it would be a disservice to all things related to fries and I would be dishonoring a Fry God (if there is one).

It was so hard to find Park on Fremont as they don't have a sign in front but in the BACK by the parking (wtf?) Maybe they want to seem mysterious and low-key? *shrug*\n\nThe rating for this place was good and I love me a good gastropub. It was PACKED which is a good sign. It has a hipster vibe and many people kept trying to get in. The whole street was poppin'. They played good music. The inside looked classy and the back patio was cozy in an enchanted garden kind of way. Getting seated was lame. The hostess seemed so bored and bland. She had no personality. We were lucky enough to spot and steal a table for 2 on the patio facing the street *slick* :)  The rest of the service was fantastic by everyone else we encountered. I don't know the waitress' name, but she was Asian and was an excellent server!!\n\nThe classic cheeseburger was thick, soft, juicy, and full of flavor! It fell part which was a bummer and it was a little too pink in the center for my liking (it was even too dark for me to tell for sure HOW pink it was) but it tasted AMAZING. The french fries were freshly cut and tasty. My boyfriend got the Mac and CheeseSteak. He said it was good.  But the best part were the sweet potato teeter tots! OMG! Heaven in my mouth!! We'd never had anything like it. They were so soft and creamy yet crispy. It's hard to explain but it's a must try!! Also to die for is the Unicorn cocktail. We chose this one of the 3 signature cocktails they offer. It's ginger-based, mint, lemon. MMMMMMM!!\n\nI can't wait to go back to Vegas!"

When we arrived, we were glibly told that there was no more food being served. So we opted just for drinks. My girlfriend ordered a Long Island iced tea and I a Manhattan. Both were served completely wrong. First, the Long Island was served in a cheap plastic cup, and was made completely wrong. It tasted more like lemonade than anything else. We weren't even sure it was the right drink. My Manhattan came in a tiny rocks glass and was actually served on the rocks. There's no way if it was properly made to portion, that it would have even fit in that tiny glass (with the improperly added ice). It tasted like barely more than a Bourbon on the rocks. The bartender had no clue what he was making or how to make them. And for paying $24 for the two drinks, they should have been made right. Not to mention that if you walk down the street to Atomic Liquors, you'll get the best Manhattans made in all of downtown. Beyond all of this, we were part of a group who had called ahead and told them we would have 30-60 people coming. And at $12 a drink, that's a lot of money. However, the management treated us all like crap and decided to make it last call at around 10 minutes to Midnight. Really? On Fremont street in Las Vegas? What, does the staff have school in the morning? Save your time, your money, and the pain and just go to a better bar. There's plenty downtown that will make better drinks, at better prices, treat you better, and will stay up with you throughout the night--like a good grown-up bar should. A big 2 thumbs down here."

The majority of the seating in the restaurant is outside on their patios, so I had to wait about 45 minutes past my reservation to be seated. Other than that, my experience was great here! The servers were pleasant and attentive. If you're someone who rolls their eyes at \"hipster restaurants\" then this probably isn't your scene. It's hipster paradise, but that's my kind of place.\n\nThe brunch OJ and bottle of champagne is a steal at $20, so definitely get that if you're brunching. The fried mac and cheese balls were the highlight of the meal. You can't beat anything with that much cheese. For my entree, I got the breakfast Monte Cristo with bacon egg and cheese between French toast slices. I wasn't blown away by it - I prefer a traditional pancake batter Monte Cristo - but it was solid! We also tried the Chilaquiles, they're fairly spicy but also good!\n\nHonestly my favorite part of Park on Fremont was the decor. Everything is well thought out and it's really quaint and low-key.

We contemplated God's grace in the presence of the fine artwork on the back patio, and rejoiced in the glorious food! We sat out back on a chilly evening, but the propane heaters kept us warm enough. Great beer selection and all of us enjoyed the food! Favorites included the Mac and Philly Cheesesteak, the Chicken and Waffle sandwich (all that bacon!), and of course, the tots!

It can get a bit too loud especially during the day when you just want to have some lunch but overall the atmosphere is unique and very fun. \n\nTheir food is different. There is an interesting twist to most of the items. I ordered the philly mac and cheese steak the first time I came and finished it. But that doesn't say much ...being Asian I was taught to finish my plate. It wasn't the best philly cheese steak I've had...it wasn't very cheesy. They replaced the cheese with mac and cheese. I think if they included both this sandwich would be complete. \n\nI should also mention that Park is also a bar. My friend ordered one of the Bloody Mary drinks which looked really good. It was lunch so I decided to go non alcoholic and got a Jones soda. \n\nI would come back and have been coming back because I am just in love with the venue. The back patio is adorable. They have a very cute set up, interesting d\u00e9cor, and an adult see-saw!!! So glad this place opened up down-town."

However, the stuffed wild fowl behind the bar are appropriate fixtures in this contemporary, urban play on a vintage, Texas hunting lodge.  The menu is short, simple and centered on South-Western American fair and barbecue.  \n\nI arrived for brunch semi-haphazardly as Eat was over-booked and The Beat was having trouble with their cash register. The staff at Park greeted me pleasantly. The Server was certainly enthusiastic about the food and I took her recommendations: the Texas Tuxedo Bloody Mary and the Ranch Breakfast Skillet. I also had a cup of joe.\n\nFirst, I should state that the coffee was proper, as far as restaurant coffee goes.  It was fresh and just the right strength. The Bloody Mary, featuring fresh basil and a cucumber slice, was savory and refreshing,  peppery and minty.  It was an original recipe that became an instant classic for me.  \n\nThe Ranch Skillet was not a disappointment, either.  When it was laid before me, I found layer after layer after layer of breakfast ingredients stacked one on top of the other: a bed of crisped red potato wedges, grilled onions and peppers, a scoop of chorizo, a handful of cheddar, and two perfectly fried eggs, all served in a sizzling cast-iron skillet. I recommend this to any patron looking for a spicy South Western breakfast.\n\nThe skill of the restaurant's kitchen staff showed through in the Ranch Skillet as well as their commitment to quality and attention to detail.  \n\nI encourage every one to visit Park on Fremont for brunch.  It was certainly a happy accident that I wandered in this morning, but it was no accident that the food was excellent... because these folks really know what they're doing.  I wish them much success!!"

There are a lot of cool bars downtown but the problem is they don't serve food! You can get a slice at Uncle Joe's but it's much more practical to serve food and alcohol at the same location. Kudos to the owners on the decoration, it is really fab. And the outdoor seating is great; you need to get here asap before it gets too hot. Also, it's great that they open at 11:00; bars in big cities are open early, sometimes a beer at noon is what you need.\n\nMy husband and I dropped in literally when it opened at 11:00 and were promptly seated outdoors, the weather was beautiful! We looked over the beer menu; they have a good selection, although it tends to be pretty mainstream. The hubby ordered an IPA that came in a mason jar and I got a can of a beer called Moose Drool. It was awesome, I felt very manly drinking it. Ron Swanson would definitely approve. The ccktail menu didn't really appeal to me, I think this place is best suited for a beer, or five."

            "review": "If I could give this establishment ZERO stars, I would. This was my third time dining at Park. It is Halloween night, everywhere is busy. My friends and I work at a casino on the strip and we decided we wanted to go have some food and something to drink to celebrate the holiday. We are locals and we can choose to go anywhere in this wonderful city, yet we chose Park. We ordered pretty much one of everything from the appetizer menu and we each had one cocktail. I would say total-we spent cumulatively around $150. The time was about 2:20am when we wrapped up, finished paying, and said our goodbyes at the entrance. I had to use the restroom and so did my roommate, so after hugging our friends goodbye I tried to walk back through the front entrance to use their restroom but I was abruptly stopped by the bouncer-Louie-or at least that was the name he gave us. He informed me that I could not go back inside because they were closing (they close at 3am and it is now 2:25am). At first I thought he was joking, so I smiled at him and continued to take a step forward. He placed his complete body in front of me and screamed in my face \"DID YOU NOT HEAR ME? WE ARE CLOSING\" I am naturally a pretty calm person so I said, \"well, we just had dinner here. Are you going to tell me that a paying customer may not use your restroom facilities?\" He then waved his arms in the air and continued to scream like a maniac toward everyone out front of the establishment \"OH, YEAH, FINE!! EVERYONE COME ON IN!! WE DON'T WANT TO GO HOME\" The manager was standing right there next to him and she did absolutely nothing. Since when is it okay to treat people like this? I literally just ate dinner here and you are not going to let me go pee? While he was having his conniption fit, I walked passed him and headed to the back of the restaurant-which was full of people by the way-and went to the restroom. I turned to see my roommate behind me. Good. So, we went to the bathroom and when we got out I noticed a part of the Park that I had never seen before. As I mentioned earlier, this was my third (and last!) time coming here, however I had never used the restroom and therefore never saw this garden back porch they have. My roommate, having been there more frequently than I, told me about a \"see-saw\" room as well. We started to walk through the crowd of people in the back of the restaurant to see this \"see-saw\" room. When we got back there, it was just that. An adult sized see-saw. How fun right? So, I jump on one side and she is on the other and we teetered and tottered a few times and I had almost completely forgotten how rude the security up front was. We then asked another patron to take our photo. Just as he was about to take it the manager (a lady) came back and said to my roommate and I \"you two that were (and she used air quotes) just using the bathroom-you have to leave NOW!\" And I said, \"okay we are about to leave, we just want to take a picture\". And she screamed at us as if we were her four year old children, \"YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOOOOW!!!!\" And again, I said, \"we will leave after we take the picture\". So she threatened me saying she would call security and I said as calm as ever, \"please do\". I really just wanted her to walk away so we could take the damn picture. She then threatened us by saying she was going to call Metro. I said, \"that would be lovely\". I then informed her that my uncle is the chief of police at Metro. All of this harassment from the manager was in a matter of 1-3 minutes. It was still not 3am, which is their \"closing time\". As we got off the see-saw, Louie was there again staring at us with eyes like daggers. We began our departure from the restaurant and I over heard the manager lady say, \"nice name drop...\" So, I turned to her and said, \"he is the chief of police\". And she said, \"that's great, I'm sure he would be really proud of you\". I said, \"of me?!? I'm sure your upper management would be thrilled to know how you treat paying customers.\" Before I could even finish that sentence she was walking behind the bar area, likely to where her office is. I've never been so appalled in my life. From the security out front not allowing paying customers to use their restroom facilities and then yelling about how he wants to go home, meanwhile the manager is just standing there allowing that type of behavior. I have worked in the hospitality industry for over a decade and no matter how annoying or rude or wrong a customer is, I have never-ever treated another human being that way. Where is your work ethic Park? Why do you treat paying customers like you are doing them a favor by letting them come inside? Park has the most unfriendly and rude staff I have ever encountered. I have never written a Yelp review before but this experience was so appalling that I felt compelled to. People should not treat other people this way! Especially managers! You have an example to set. Shame on you both!"

We were quickly seated at the back patio, but from there it was a long wait. As you can imagine, we were a tad hungover from NYE partying the night before (this IS Vegas, after all), and to have to wait probably 10-20 minutes before even getting water is terrible. We were actually served our bloody marys and Dirty Girl Scout ($8.00) before our water, which on any other morning might be acceptable.\n\nService was SLOW, but apologetic. Our waitress actually said she'd never seen the restaurant this busy before... but there wasn't a wait at the door, there didn't appear to be any large parties.. they were simply under staffed, which on a New Years morning is either bad management, or 1/2 their crew didn't show up for work.\n\nNow, the food: WOW, very nicely done! The bloody marys (Texas Tuxedo $10.00) were GREAT, actually, served in a large mason jar with cucumbers and large basil leaves, spicy, no salt on the rim (not needed). So right away I was feeling relief from the wait and my headache, and starving stomach...\n\nWe got the fried Mac n Cheese balls ($7.00) for an appetizer. The were nice and hot, although we didn't cheese-burn the roof of our mouths, which is amazing. Crispy fresh batter, very thick cheese inside, with a size of cheese for dipping. 5 cheese balls total, each a bit larger than a golf ball, smaller than a tennis ball...\n\nThen the food: I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich ($11.00), with eggs, bacon and cheese on bread. Simple enough, this was delicious! The eggs over easy actually seemed like the BEST eggs over easy I've ever experienced... maybe I was just that hungover/ starving, but I don't think I've ever tasted a better egg. The bread was almost like French Toast, fluffy, lightly toasted, soaking up the grease. The sandwich was very greasy, but I devoured it quickly and happily.\n\nFriends ordered the Breakfast Waffle ($10.00) and the BBQ Texas Burger ($10.00).  Prices all around are a bit steep, but the quality of the food really shows with each bite. If only service were faster! But as I said, they were very apologetic and doing their best to reach everyone and serve a fantastic meal. A paid parking lot is around the corner. Patio seating in front and back of the restaurant, a small bar and dining area inside. \n\n***Another note: the ambiance is great. Outdoor seating with christmas lights in the trees, very good, hip art on the walls. Perfect for millennial hipsters (meaning to be only slightly patronizing! *** Really though, kudos to the scene!"

The patios are beautiful, amd the inside is comfortable. I love the San Diego Burger, and the Tacos are pretty good for a plqce that doesn't specialize in tacos.\n\nI'm writing this particular review to talk about the service. When Park on Ftemont first opened, I had a number of great dining experoences, but recently the service here has been, for the most part, mediocre if not outright nonexistent. \n\nIn most cases it was simply that the servers had unenthusiastic attitudes, no smiles, and an apparent overall distaste for having to be at work that day. A number of the times the service was slow, and it was hard to get the servers attention without them seeming annoyed. \n\nI understand that this is a pretty high traffic place in the evenings, and none of this is normally bad enough to mention. I mention it now because of the problem I had with the hostess the other day.\n\nI was planning on going to take part in Taco Tuesday with some girlfriends, but I was interested in bringing my sister who was not yet 21. I called ahead to see at what time they stopped searing minors. Since I had been there before with my sister, and had even eaten inside, I thought I had heard the girl on the phone say she could seat minors on the patio after six. When we arrived I told her we had minors in our party and asked if we could sit on the patio. She abruptly and demeaningly informed my party that minors were not allowed here after six. When I began to explain I had called someone earlier, she broke in before I could even finish to say \"that was me, and I can't seat you.\" Taken aback, I turned around to walk out with my group. As we left, she mumbled \"Have a nice day.\" All as she sipped on what looked like some sort of mojito based on the color and the muddled mint in the drink.\n\nI was aware that I may have misheard what she had said on the phone, but the fact that she was so unapologetic and just plain mean made me never want to go back.\n\nI'm sure I'll get over it eventually because like I said, the food is good, but I'm not a fan of the \"exclusive, you're-not-worth-our-time, cool-kids only\" vibe the employees have been giving me. It makes me want to go there, and take new people with me, a lot less."

Once inside it feels like you've tumbled down the rabbit hole. Every inch of the place is dotted with quirky items, it's fun to let your eyes wander and see what they discover. I giggled at the stuffed birds, drooled over the taps on the mantle behind the bar and admired the chevron patterned floors while we waited to be seated. We chose to sit outside in the back outdoor garden. \n\nIt was a weeknight so it was pretty quiet. Our waitress was attentive, though, it seemed she might have been new. She was unfamiliar with several of the draft beers. My Kellerwies made its way to me so no harm done. Drinks are served in mason jars. The selection is wide and varied. We got started with Mac & Cheese Balls ($7). \n\nThe description hinted at bacon in the Mac & Cheese, however, there was no evidence of smokey, salty bacon. The balls were rolled in panko and fried crisp. They lacked any pizzazz. The garbage fries were recommended by our server we probably should have tried those. \n\nSandwiches run $10-$12, we had the Cajun Chicken, BBQ Burger and Philly Mac & Cheese. All were edible, but none really shined. The sweet potato tater tots are good, but the sweetness becomes cloying after a few. It's best to check out Park on Fremont for drinks and maybe a snack. If you're looking for meal, there are better choices to be had."

I would recommend those highly and don't forget to get a beer in a jar. FYI it's best to park at the El Cortes and not the parking lot next to park. It's only one dollar an hour at the El Cortez vs 20.00 for the unsuspecting tourist."

I went with the steak tacos and my friend went with a burger. I love that they give you such a full serving because I was so stuffed even after 2 tacos when it came with 3!\n\nwe had a couple cocktails which I wish I remembered the name of the one I ordered which was sweet and had cucumber in it. my friend had the whisky. cocktail which was great as well. \n\ndefinitely stop by this place if you're downtown for great drinks and food :) or if it's late night and you need a quick pit stop!"

We were very overwhelmed by the beauty and artistic wisdom of Park. \nService absolutely needs to be improved but they just opened so Im sure in a few weeks the speed and quality of service will be improved greatly. The employees were all very kind and excited-- just working out the kinks! \nEverything was lovely! We first arrived and were seated on the front bar side patio. I had been very excited for Park to open as I had seen images of the interior and it looked like an artists own personal version of Alice in Wonderland. The back patio opened at 6 so after our first round of drinks we moved to the back.  It is lovely-- down to every detail we truly appreciated everything. Its trendy, artistic, perfect for downtown and it definitely is going to be a local hotspot.  Its somewhat similar to Commonwealth but its more like its Hipster sister. \n\nOrdered stuffed sprout & swiss burger with sweet potato tots-- ketchup was homemade spicy which was very interesting. Overall really delicious-- can't wait to go back!"

I have been wanting to come to this restaurant every since my LV friends started writing reviews about this place! \nSince we were in town celebrating our anniversary, I thought this would be a semi romantic spot to enjoy some good food, drinks and enjoy being in DTLV under the night sky! \n\nI made a reservation a week before we came into town, Sarah (I believe was her name) took all my information down and answered all my questions (most important: what time does the kitchen stop serving food? Her answer 1:00 am... SCORE)  I also mentioned that we were coming there to celebrate our anniversary to which she got an excited tone to her voice and said this is a great place to do that. I will put you outside in the back garden; I know you will love it! \n\nOn the night we had our 10:00 pm reservation we were running behind taking our anniversary photos, I called in to see if we could move it to 11:00 pm. The manager answered and said that will not be a problem.\n\nParking is either on the street or in a parking lot, we opted for the street. We have not been to DTLV for a while and had no idea on the huge changes it has been undergoing. In addition, I must say DTLV you are starting to clean up really well. Instead of all weirdoes, there is more of a hipster meets college meets semi professional vibe going on in that area! \n\nWe walked up and was greeted the by security who ID'd us. I told him we had a reservation and where should we go (total noob moment) he said that the manager could help us and on cue out, he walked. He asked if we would like to sit outside in front, inside at the bar or outside in the garden. I said the garden would be nice.  We were lead out to the back area, I fell in love with the hall leading out the back door chandeliers of all shapes, and sizes were hung up high!\n\nWalking out into the garden area was beautiful, surreal, and cozy all rolled into one! It is a little vintage, a little Alice in wonderland/Mad Hatter tea party-ish.\n\nWe were seated at a smaller table, to which the manager apologized that the bigger tables were taken at the moment. It was not an issue at all to us. He said that the menus/drink menu were on the table and our waitress will be right with us. He wished us a Happy Anniversary too!\n\nOur waitress Carina was super outgoing and friendly. She came by and took our drink orders. I was quite impressed as she was the only waitress that was serving everyone who was outside! \nOur drinks were delivered to our table as we took in more of our surroundings. Loved the neon lime green electric sign on the wall that said \"Fucking Beautiful.\" High above us was a vintage-gothic Cinderella carriage complete with a chandelier inside! Various humorous paintings were hung around along with vintage statues. We were told before we left to check out the smoking area and the famous seesaw. Which we did after dinner, sadly we did not get to take a ride of the 'saw as there were already a couple of fun loving people who were waiting!\n\nOur waitress came back and said she wanted to move us to a bigger table that opened up. She said she felt bad that we had this tiny table. So we moved across from where we were seated. \n\nShe then asked if we were ready to order, which we were:\n\nHad the Fried Chicken and waffles with fries on the side. I have no clue why some of these reviews complained that the food was mediocre or lacked any taste. Both Minh's and my dinner were tasty! FYI I fell in love with his tater tots (but I will leave that for him to review) my waffles were huge and fluffy with just enough syrup and powdered sugar to top it off! The fried chicken was cook to a golden brown and was tender and juicy on the inside! I was able to finish one part of the sandwich and was working on the second half when I started to realize I was getting full! \n\nDuring our meal, Carina made sure we were happy with our meal, she had our drinks refilled and brought out to us! \n\nAfter we were finished with our dinner, we were told that the restaurant had a surprise for us. A couple of moments later a waiter brought us this HUGE chocolate chip ice cream sandwich cookie! We were wished a Happy Anniversary by Carina and if we needed anything else to let her know.\n\nThe cookie was a little hard on top but the ice cream was delicious and made the bottom cookie soft and more enjoyable to eat! However, being we were already full it was hard to enjoy such a lovely and thoughtful gift! I had a couple of bites of everything before I tapped out for the night! \n\nPrices and quantity of food was not bad at all! A++++ to Carina and the night manager (who worked on 5/19) thank you so much guys for making our special night more enjoyable! \n\nI think Minh and I found a new hang out spot in DTLV for good food, and radtastic drinks!!"

Meeting my friend, I was so excited to finally try Park on Fremont after walking by a few times since moving here, but not having the time to go inside. \nArriving around 11:30 it was pretty dead, I sat outside with my friend in the fun, beauteous rear patio full of floppy cushions, mixture of chairs, trees and raised planters with ferns and succulents, flowers, statues and a large fireplace, and dreamy artwork. Inside appears just as fanciful with colorful, chimerical wallpaper and chandeliers in carrying sizes and shapes. The bar has a large taxidermy exhibit cases, lending to the whimsical feel of the entire place. \nOur waitress came over and was very friendly, recommended a couple cocktails and food. My friend ordered a Moscow mule of gin and muddled berries, she loved it, I had The Unicorn, vodka and lemon and ginger beer, amazing. We ordered to share buffalo wings (Wednesday is wings Wednesday specials), Mahi tacos (fantastic), and ahi salad (huge and yummy). \nWe sat out on the back patio for 2.5 hours, our servers were attentive and food great, the place was full when we left. \nThe manager was awesome and tried to adjust the $20 parking fee my friend had at the adjoining lot, but couldn't and adjusted our bill to apologize for the ridiculous parking fee. The lot is not directly related to POF, but the manager was disappointed that the lot charged my friend so much when she said she was eating next door. I thought that was great he went out of his way to remedy that. He made 2 new customers for the future!! \nWe'll be back to POF."

As others have said, the mac and cheese philly is good in theory but not executed well.\n\nStaff seem to be MIA most of my visits, which is fine up until a certain point- I like to be able to converse without servers pestering me or making me feel obligated to order a new drink every time mine dips below half-full, but it would be nice if they seemed to care about their patrons."

Menu is on the smaller side but well rounded and thought out. I'm from New York, and in a way this felt like an approachable yet trendy Williamsburg joint.\n\nI shared the chicken and waffle sandwich with a friend which was a great portion and came with some sort of whiskey infused syrup. We opted for sweet potato tots as our side and they did not disappoint. On the sandwich the chicken was crispy and tender, the waffle was soft and sweet and there was booze in the syrup-- what's not to love? Had some of my friends Mac and Cheese balls as well and almost stole her entire plate. Crunchy outside, creamy cheesy goodness on the inside with just a little kick.\n\nDrinks were a good size and strong. One friend didn't like his and our waitress immediately noticed and offered a different choice which says a lot about their attentiveness.\n\nCan't wait to come back!"

I really felt like I stepped into an Urban Outfitters catalog once I walked through the bar and onto the patio dining area with its strung outdoor patio lighting, mounted wall plates that were probably thrifted, and the various pairs of shoes that were hung from a wire to indicate that the street pharmacist is just around the corner. \n\nFOOD\nVeggie Sliders with Sweet Potato Teeter Tots: The Veggie Sliders were bland.  No flavor whatsoever. There was a thin layer of what looked like mayonnaise, but its flavor wasn't detectable at all. The yellow, sweet sauce used for dipping the tots into didn't help. I even requested some mustard to slather onto the mini, meatless patties. Again, no flavor. I concocted a mixture consisting of both sweet sauce and mustard. Still, no flavor. These sliders need their own special sauce or more seasonings because these were beyond dull. \n\nThe Sweet Potato Teeter Tots tasted similar to churros. They were sweet and a little crunchy. Its accompanying sauce was unnecessary. \n\nSERVICE\nOur waitress did a good job at checking up on us often. Though, she seemed to exhibit hesitance after I requested mustard for my sliders. \n\nOTHER\nThe patio is lovely, and I like the whole feeling of outdoor urban dining. BUT, I wouldn't suggest dining out there. The stench of sewage and garbage tainted the air and wafted into our direction. At one point, one of the employees lit a stick of incense which wasn't strong enough to mask the overpowering odors.\n\nOVERALL\nThis place is probably more suitable for grabbing drinks than a bite to eat, but I can't imagine ever making a return visit even just for a drink."

You get to really enjoy the atmosphere and get better food/drink service. \n\nEven though the menu is short, it had many items to choose from.  I ordered one of their bloody marys (Texas Tuxedo) to start the night off along with some healthy dishes - chicken wrap & a strawberry salad.  Each of my friends ordered something different, that way we can try out more items on the menu to see what their BEST dish is.  Their steak salad was definitely more delicious than the strawberry salad.  The mac n' cheese philly cheese steak was very interesting.  Yes, very fattening and yummy!  One thing I would do differently (just because I'm really into texture) I would bake some Panko on top of the mac n' cheese to make it have a crununnnnccchhh :)  Their nachos was different.  They placed the steak flank and egg separately on the side of the chips.  I think for the night my favorite was their steak salad :P     \n\nI love their back patio!!

The hostess convinced us to eat at the outdoor patio right next to a space heater since indoor seating was full. Too bad the space heater died out about 10 minutes after we sat down. Woman! Don't promise me heat, only to leave me in the bitter cold moments after I get comfortable at my table! The table next to us requested the heater be turned back on all but 3 times. The runner was in charge of this duty, but was struggling to keep up with Taco Tuesday night. He eventually got to the heater, but we were finishing up our meals by the time we were warm and toasty again. \n\n$2 STREET TACOS: My husband said the tacos were \"perfect\". The tacos were topped with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream. I asked if they could make vegetarian tacos, but no such luck. :(  \n\nGARBAGE FRIES ($5 during Happy Hour): The fries were good until they weren't. Have you ever ate something that started out good, but then blew out by the end of the meal? That's what happened to me. \n\n$1 DOS EQUIS: These bottles are cute. They're practically made for infants. I laughed out loud when I poured a bottle into the plastic cup the restaurant provided - it barely filled a quarter of the cup! I say, False Advertisement! They should have \"Tiny\" written in next to their $1 Dos Equis menu. \n\nSERVICE: The waitress and the runner were doing their best to keep up. My husband got his street tacos before we received our beers. There seemed to be a lot of confusion on which tables ordered what. Maybe it's because we were sitting outside? \n\nATMOSPHERE: There was a combination of younger and older people here. Our table on the patio was tucked away behind some greenery, so we were afforded some privacy. The music was decent, until it cut off into awkward silence. Turn the music back on peeps! \n\nReturn Visit? Yes, but not on Taco Tuesday. Their selection for vegetarians is quite small, but I'd like to try their Veggie burger ($10) next time. If the veggie burger fails me, then nope, not coming back.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #13"

The playful and eclectic decor provides a fun environment in which to enjoy some slightly upscale and/or creative bar food. The happy hour deals are great. Many of the appetizers are $5 during happy hour and are still full portions and many of the draft beers are $5 as well which includes a very decent selection of quality craft brews. \n\nWe tried:\n\nFried Pickles - Very good, crispy, well-seasoned and served with a very flavorful sauce for dipping. \n\nGarbage Fries - I'm not usually a fan of smothered fries. I like my fries crispy and salty, that's it. But these were great. They still managed to maintain their crispiness and the cheese and toppings were actually very flavorful and delicious. \n\nMac and Cheese Balls - Our server said this was her favorite but we weren't bowled over by it. Ultimately we just thought they were bland. \n\nChicken Bar Bites - Basically boneless wings served with 3 sauces and french fries. Not bad, but not great. Their fries are excellent though. \n\nWe had one slightly odd complaint. The restaurant smelled like fish, and not in a good way. My wife and I could both smell it, and I have a pretty lousy sense of smell. We asked the person at the table next to us and they could smell it too. Our sever suggested that it may be the sewer lines on Fremont (the entire front of the restaurant is open to the outside) but we didn't smell anything outside, just inside. We will definitely give this place another try (there are other items on the menu that I want to try out) and when we do, if the smell is gone I will update my review to remove any mention of it."

Worst service I've ever had in Vegas.\n\n1) Nobody manning the entrance.  Waited 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge our presence.    \n\n2) Took another 15 minutes to get a food order in.  We only ordered 2 items. \n\n3) One item (tacos!) came out after 45 minutes!  The other item (an appetizer), totally went missing until we asked about it...so another 20 minutes.\n\n4)  Our water sat empty for 40 minutes.\n\n5) We didn't order drinks initially, because we were trying to decide.  Big mistake because no one ever came by again.\n\n\nWho manages this place?  The service is terrible....all around.  The food was ok, but not for the hour+ we waited for tacos and an appetizer.  I can understand if they were understaffed, or if it was a weekend, or a busy holiday, but there were open tables and the servers were not really operating as if they were on a mission.\n\nAgain, I've been here several times, but not sure if I would spend my $ here again."

Our service has always been good - even on busy nights - the staff is pretty friendly and will keep conversation with you. \nThe food is fantastic. I always leave full. The chilaquiles were my favorite but I don't see them on the menu anymore :(. Their garbage fries are listed as an pickings but I'm always soooo full from them. So so so so so delicious and spicy! Their beer list is perfection. One of the few places I know of that sells Sam Smith Strawberry and Raspberry beer. Yum. Yum. Yum. \nSide note - check out the artwork around the place. Definitely out there but you'll find some pieces that will bring up quite the conversation. \nSit in the back if you're looking for ambiance and a little romance. Sit in the front for endless entertainment from the people walking Fremont. \nDon't forget the seesaw in the back!"

Of course, hanging out on a patio is done best with a cold, adult beverage, so also go here to drink. \n\nI have been here twice, and the reason for my second visit honestly wasn't because I just had to have some fabulous dish again, it was because my pals that live downtown were hanging out on the patio, and I was jealous. I knew I was probably going to miss something (like Tony Hsieh delivering happiness in person or a Jesus Jam Band on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd) if I didn't go. So, I went, and therefore, did not miss either of those things, both of which actually happened. \n\nThe patio offering at Park On Fremont is without doubt in a class of luxury. You can sit out front and watch Fremont Street in all its glory, or you can head out back and go for the Secret Garden experience. Both options have their time and their place. Try both. \n\nAs for the drink offerings, I am excited to see they offer variations of the Bloody Mary! Granted, I haven't tried them, but I think it's an art form we don't have enough of in Vegas. They also have a nice beer list, but mostly in cans/bottles, and on my first visit, they didn't have 30% of the list. I think it was because they were still in soft opening mode, so I won't hold it against them. \n\nAs for the food, it is a bit underwhelming. Portion sizes are small, and although the menu is a list of delicious potential, dishes are just a little bit less than you hoped for in size and presentation. Everything I have tried tastes good, and I do appreciate that they have a variety of options, including vegetarian, and just the fact that they have food!\n\nSo, I don't think I would go here with a starved foodie (at least not yet), but for a night downtown, it's definitely the happening spot to get your drink and patio on."

With drinks and tip you'd probably be out the door for ~$30 a person. The music was good and not overbearing. The painting of horses doin' it, hanging in the patio, was really the best. Another reviewer mentioned the same people owned Commonwealth which explains the Mark Ryden paintings at both places. The decor overall was interesting if not a bit busy. Like it was trying too hard. The waitress was friendly and helpful, if not a bit new to the place. \n\nWhen you're out on the patio, don't hesitate to go around the north wall. There's a small, easy-to-miss, path on the left and there's a small bar-like seating area and... a mothafuckin' teeter-totter! You're welcome."

I had the 'San Diego burger' (I think that's what it was, but I can't seem to find their menu anywhere. it had avocado on it) with some sweet potato tots.  I also shared the fried pickles with my lovely dining partner, since I am a discerning fried pickle eater.  \n\nBeer selection was great, decor/atmosphere was great - make sure to check out the patio out back.  I wasn't in love with my burger, though.. I didn't find it particularly flavorful - the meat especially didn't stand out to me.  Also, I did not like the tots that much.. being sweet potato they were covered in cinnamon, which is fine and complimented the taste, but.. they were small and not that crispy or fluffy.  I would have liked a bigger sized tot, for sure - and maybe something like a drizzle of honey on them?  I don't know.. also, the sauce that they were served with did not go at all.. I kept trying it but was not into it.  \n\nAs for the fried pickles.. I liked the batter they used (although I would have liked it a little thicker and/or maybe with a little cornmeal mixed in?) and they were fried properly.  I did not like the pickles on the inside.. I know they were homemade but they were barely pickled.. I expect my fried pickles to be very pickled and super classic dill-pickle style.  These were hipster fried pickles, take that as you may...\n\nI would come back here for drinks and give a chance to some other things on the menu.. maybe I just didn't find the right thing yet - it *is* a cool spot."

You have the option to sit outside and people watch, sit inside by the bar surrounded by stuffed birds and interesting wallpaper or outside in the beer garden.  We sat out in the front to people watch since it was NYE evening and many people were headed towards Fremont St.  We started out with the \"Sampler\" which is a sampler of 4 drink items, craft beer and/ or specialty cocktails.  I don't remember exactly what we ordered but we asked the server which 2 beers she recommended, we got a dark hazelnut beer and a light beer similar to a blonde (a Sacramento brew). We also ordered the \"trophy wife\" and the \"unicorn\" all were good but the cocktails may have been more enjoyable on a hot summer day rather than a cold winter night.  Either way we finished everything.  We also ordered the Garbage fries and chicken bites.  The garbage fries didn't feel greasy with a whole bunch of junk piled on like I've had at other places and I didn't feel all nasty and like I hated life afterwards.  The chicken bites were large pieces of juicy chicken, more of a 2-3 bite chicken served with sauces.  If they had more sauces or 1 really good dipping sauce (a la raising canes) it would be on point +1 !  Either way I was happy with everything ordered.  Will definitely return, and try their bloody Marys! *do not miss the beer garden in the back, it's \"F*cking Beautiful\""

CUTE, right.\n\nMy BF knew the hostess; and she originally seated us in a booth in the lounge but, said she freed up a table in back for us.\n\nWe walked into what seemed like \"secret (not really) garden\" setting in that the decor seemed so whimsical and romantic. There was a tree decorated with lights in the middle of the patio surrounded by a flower garden; and our table was right next to it. It was so pretty. My boyfriend and I talk about how it would be a great setting for a 1st date as there's alot of people watching and the decor itself just gave alot to talk about.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered his favorite beer, Banana Bread Beer, which obviously tastes like what it sounds. I ordered \"The Unicorn\" cocktail just because there was ginger beer in it. And we decided to share the chicken and waffles sandwich with sweet potato tater tots.\n\nAs we waited for our food, we noticed more things about the decor. Like there was an iron carriage on one of their rooftops; there were baby Jordans (Nike shoes for all the un-sneakerheads) hanging from a wire that runs across the patio; AND there was a see-saw (teeter-totter) in their designated smoking section. \nTold you --- WHIMSICAL =) I loved it. \nAlso, always love wallpaper and THEY gots it. Almost like Cosmopolitan Hotel's funky wallpapers!\n\nMy boyfriend got his beer; and we got the chicken and waffles sammie. The chicken was savory with all the maple on it and really thin like a chicken katsu; I liked it very much. The waffles, on the otherhand, not-so-much. It was soft =( \nI'm sure my eggo waffles at home would have been better!\nThankfully, the sweet potato tots more than made up for the shoddy waffles. \n\nSadly, I never got my \"Unicorn\" cocktail til almost the end of dinner. Waitress said the bar was backed up. \nNew restaurant; I know they're still figuring out the kinks.\n\n\nOverall, I'm in love with this place.

We also ordered some buffalo wings and mac and cheese balls.\n\nThe whole experience was really great and I'll definitely come back again."

I had the Philly, and a Lady something Bloody Mary and my friend had the Chicken & waffles sandwich & two minty vodka drinks the Unicorn & something else.  It was a good vibe, good for people watching, and our total bill was $ 50.00 and I left 20% tip.  We went inside to check out the place when we were gonna leave and the inside was really cool and much cooler (weather) even if there fron door is completely open.  The bar was packed.  We went tot the back & there is a pretty garden and unique decor.  There was a lil' smell but it is next to an alley.  Parking next door is expensive but we parking across the street in a hotel parking took the elevastor and it brings you down to where Hennessey & heart attack grill are and all you have to do is cross the street and you are there.  Park on Fremont is cool, I recoomend it, and I will return.  It's smack on the corner nect to Radio City Pizzy, insert coins, the Griffin, the Von guard Lounge, and the downtown area is much cleaner.  I heard Zappos dropped some money for that and renovations.  I will post pic's soon."

I should be laid out flat after three drinks in the time I drank it. But I was barely buzzed. I mostly felt a sugar high."

First, the romaine in my salad was brown on the ends so it obviously wasn't fresh. Second, my soup and bread bowl came out colder than room temperature and I had to send it back, which I hate doing being a server myself. Third, we told our server, skinny girl with long black hair and purple on top that our parking meter was about to run out so we needed our check. She walked past us again a few minutes later with no check, said nothing, and then another couple of minutes later we see her seating a party of twenty and taking all of their drink orders! Get out of here!! I had to leave the table and go pull the car out while my boyfriend waited for our check another 10 minutes. UNREAL! We still left almost 20%, but I hope she realizes she missed out on the usual 30-40% we normally leave both being servers ourselves. Lastly, a little too pricy for what you get. Don't think we'll be back."

The art and taxidermy inside are a very interesting choice of decor and they remind me of a trendy little place I once dined at in San Diego. I've only even had the pleasure of dining here for lunch and it's never very busy. It is pretty small inside, but they have plenty of outdoor patio seating. I can see this place really bursting at the seams on a warm Vegas night. The menu is small, but the drinks look absolutely delicious (I can't wait to try one), here is the low down on the food. \n\nI highly recommend ordering the mac and cheese balls! They are ooey and gooey on the inside and come with a yummy creamy dipping sauce. I wasn't impressed with their fried pickles, the batter wasn't crisp enough and they just weren't dill enough for me. The mac and cheese Philly sandwich is a kitschy take on a Philly cheesesteak. It was pretty good, I just wish there was a little more cheese flavor and a lot more steak. I had mine with a side of their sweet potato tots that all of my friends had been raving about. I was disappointed with the tots. They were dusted with a cinnamon sugar and that just doesn't go well with a savory sandwich. I remedied this by ordering the regular fries the next time I had lunch here and was still slightly disappointed. I really wish they could nail a French fry! The fries were just a little sad and cold. I did, however, enjoy the burger I got, but it's not super hard to make a delicious burger in my opinion. My advice, stick to the bar bites and the drinks and enjoy the people watching!"

I ordered the San Diego burger and my wife had the steak salad. We also ordered a side of the fried pickles. I have to admit that I was not impressed. The meat on the burger was way too much and you couldn't really taste anything else. The steak salad was ok but definitely nothing to rave about. The fried pickles were ok but they were soggy and cold by the time we got them. Now I understand that having good delivered can and will affect the food quality but even having said that I don't know if I would ever actually eat there again because it was just mediocre and they don't have a lot of options on the menu."

Here's a few items I found especially good, the Mac and cheese balls were very good they weren't to heavily breaded and the cheese used inside as well as the bacon were both very rich, the cheese balls were unlike any others I've ever had. The garbage fries had pretty much anything you could think of putting on French fries only it didn't taste like garbage ;) the jalape\u00f1os and the fried egg on the fries were absolutely to die for and had it not been for park on Fremont offering this dish I would have never thought to add these toppings to cheese fries. The chicken bar bites were so flavorful and the interesting thing about this restaurant is they don't use traditional breading on most items they actually use a corn flake \"breading\" which adds an interesting flavor profile to the dishes. I must close this review by commenting on the drinks. My favorite offering here was the Derby Breakfast Club, the drink was a very very delicious Bloody Mary which contained bacon infused rye whiskey, Bloody Mary mix, hickory liquid smoke, a huge strip of bacon and a hard boiled egg... This drink was a meal in itself but it was the best damn Bloody Mary I've ever had in my life!"

Personally I think the Bloody Mary list is awesome; the Tuxedo is my favorite. The decor inside and outside is interesting and unique; I often find myself spacing out staring at the art and designs on the walls. The fried pickles pair well with the bloody Mary's. You won't regret giving Park on Fremont a visit. If it's a nice day sit outside in the front and people watch, or in the back and play on the teeter totter."

Once at night and once when they first opened at 11am. On both visits, I ordered different entrees and one standing appetizer: Garbage Fries. The Garbage Fries are amongst the best loaded fries that I have ever experienced. The mixture of two different cheeses, onions, fried egg, and seasonings make these fries simply decadent and an delicious indulgence that I have not found a comparable equivalent anywhere. They are a MUST ORDER item that alone make the Park on Fremont a required visit, even if you detest hipsters. \n\nThe atmosphere is another plus. Though it certainly is designed and geared toward the hipster crowd, no question, it still provides a wonderful location right on Fremont with a great park-like patio that wraps around the restaurant. The rear patio even has a teeter totter for those wanting to feel young again. The people watching is phenomenal though you should be prepared to get stared at right back. The beggars are only a few feet away so that does detract a bit but nonetheless, it is still a great spot outside. The interior is hipster and whimsical with Trivial Pursuit cards on every table for entertainment and weird art on the walls. Overall, it is a great all around atmosphere. \n\nNow the negatives:\n\n1. Though the garbage fries are incredible, I have not found any of the other appetizers or entrees to be that spectacular. The beef tacos are great but not a great value. The chicken and waffle sandwich is a bit bland and the sweet potato tots are usually lukewarm and an acquired taste at best. \n\n2. They do not allow kids to dine there after 6pm and prior to 6pm, they can only dine on the patio. \n\n3. Parking. Though there is a parking lot right adjacent to the restaurant, it is a paid parking lot that is privately owned. Your best best is to park at a casino and walk over. \n\n4. Though I personally do not find this to be a detractor, many will: this is truly Hipster central.  \n\nOverall, I like the Park on Fremont. Great location, atmosphere and signature fries that are quite possibly, the best in Las Vegas."

            "review": "I went here for brunch about a month ago and I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe only downside (why I gave it 4/5 instead of 5/5) was it says it opens at 11am and a crowd of people were waiting to get in and they opened around 10-15 minutes late. If you open at 11am then you should be ready to take customers at 11am. If you aren't ready at the correct time then change your hours. \n\nI think the thing I enjoyed the most was the prices of the cocktails. I feel a lot of other restaurants downtown charge so much for a drink ($14-$18) while Park charged around $18 for a pitcher of their sangria or mimosas. \n\nWe decided to first order a pitcher of sangria. There was three of us and we all got around 2 drinks per person. \n\nWe then decided to switch it up to mimosas. For this they bring a crate of orange juice and a whole bottle of champagne which is cooled in what looks like a summer lunch bag. I feel for what we paid it was a great deal. We ended up leaving some of the champagne because we all had to drive shortly thereafter. It also made us very sleepy. \n\nFor my entree I decided to get the Chilaquiles which were very yummy and I finished them in no time.\n\nWe all also want to try the French toast so instead of ordering that as an entree we all decided to get it as dessert. I'm love doing this at restaurants so then you order something that fills you up and something that is a little sweet. The french toast was good and was a great end to your meal.\n\nIf you decide to come here for brunch I suggest coming here right at 11am when it opens or have reservations. It is small and the space fills quickly. There also aren't a lot of tables inside and on a hot summer day you do not want to be outside if you do not have to be."

I asked if there was any seating inside and she answered rudely 'you need a reservation ', which is understandable. I then asked if we could be seated in the back patio and I got the same RUDE response!!! She needs to be trained to talk to customers in this event. She seemed so bothered with what I was asking!! She could have said something like: hey just so you know for next time, just make a reservation so that we can accommodate you better. As she walked us to the front to be seated she had told us with an attitude to pull two tables together and have a seat and walked away!!! She was clearly having a bad day and it showed!!! I had been here a few months back so I was anticipating to eat here all month long and bragging about the menu and how great it was but this girl was so rude that my party and I went elsewhere!"

            "review": "You gotta love places like Park on Fremont because of what they are trying to do: Revamp an area and make cool what once was not so cool. I have to give them mad respect, just for that fact.\n\nOwned by the same folks who own Commonwealth, this nifty little place has all the right elements to make it stand out as a contender amongst the other places popping up Downtown. They have not been open very long, so they might get more stars later on in an update if things change. But as it sits right now, I would have to say, \"come for the patio, stay for the unique beer choices.\"\n\nThe front and back patios are both great, but each one has a different vibe. The back is more chill, bigger and prettier. There is a smoking area with a see-saw and cool plants and flowers all over the place. It's a nice little reprieve from the craziness of Fremont St. \nAmbiance inside is really cool, with a trendy and artsy sort of vibe. The front patio is louder, there are more people milling about, and you get to watch all the \"Fremont Freaks and Geeks\" wave their crazy flag proudly! I'm not hatin', I'm one of them!\n\nThe beer list is pretty extensive for a smaller place like this. They have everything from Coors and Mickey's Malt Liquor, to Young's Double Chocolate Stout and Lost Coast Sacramento Blonde. Honestly, you almost start wishing they sold beer flights so you could try a little bit of everything. \nThere is a cool \"beer and a shot\" combo option on the drink menu, which always seems like a fun concept, if you are in to that sort of thing.\n\nOne element I have not been so enthralled with is the food. The Sweet Potato Teeter Tots are really funky, but in a good way! The sweet mustard dipping sauce they include with 'em really adds that extra \"yum\" factor. \nBut a few of the dishes I have tried were just sorta ok. The first time I visited, I tried to order the Grilled Cheese on Brioche, which sounded to die for. It was 86'ed, which was fine, because it was their grand opening week and they had just had their soft open right before, so they had run out of a bunch of things. Not a big deal. I'll get it next time :) \nInstead, I tried the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak, which was pretty tasty. \n\nBut the second time I visited, I was sad to see that they had taken that grilled cheese off entirely!! Sad, sad day. So I chose the Veggie Wrap, which came in a tortilla-type of casing. \nIt was just \"Eh.\" Kinda greasy, which sometimes is good, but not in this case. Not enough melted cheese, and not enough feta crumbles. Plus, the veggies were kinda wet.... Overall, it's been a little hit-and-miss with the food here. I'm confident it will more likely than not get better over time. Maybe I'm just being picky, or perhaps I have ordered the wrong things. Only time and more visits will tell.\n\nBut still come here! Sit at the patio! Especially out front. If you are a lady, you will get a couple creepy homeless dudes mackin' on you. Be prepared. And don't keep your phone or wallet on the side of the table closest to the fence, because someone could just run by and grab it. The nice thing is they do have a security guy standing by the front, just in case."

Liza was attentive and on top of the ball the whole night, so props to her! We were three of those girls boys hate to take out and all ordered salad - two of us got strawberry balsamic salads and the other ordered the steak salad. The greens were crisp - not limp at all, while the bleu cheese crumbles were not too overpowering, the portions of chicken were generous, the candied walnuts were crunchy, and the strawberries gave it just the right amount of a sweet kick. \n\nThe food hadn't even hit the table when we noticed a sewage stench near our seats against the wall that separates Park (is it okay if I just call you that?) with Radio City Pizza. We tried to do our best and give Park the benefit of the doubt, knowing that this is probably out of the restaurant's control, but then it also became noticeable that the music was TOO loud. I was in the middle of yelling about the onset of my quarter-life crisis to my friends when of course the Kings of Leon song in the back ended right as I was shouting, \"AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE!\" Great. I might as well have just megaphoned this news to the whole restaurant. \n\nUntil the noise is controlled in the back (is it like that in the front too?) I probably won't think too much about grabbing a bite there, but otherwise this could be a great place to post up for a beverage - the generous pours into mason jars means I made the right decision to have skipped the Strip to imbibe more for less."
