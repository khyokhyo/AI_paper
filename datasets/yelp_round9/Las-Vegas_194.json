            "review": "We have dinned here many times, we always have a groupon because the food is a little high in price for the type of food they serve, this could be due to it being in a casino. The servers are nice and friendly and we never have to wait to be seated. I tried the chicken wrap on one of our times there and was disappointed in what they charge to put a processed chicken finger in a wrap. I love their version of the ruben by only complaint is the meat is a little dry. My all time favorite is their fried twinkie, it melts in your mouth!! The fried pickles are also amazing the best way to start your meal. My husband was not crazy about their steak sandwich said it was a little tough, but the time before he had their fried fish and said it was amazing. I guess my review of this place is mixed they have some good menu items, but for the price i would eat elsewhere if i didn't have  a groupon. Service is great and friendly."

What words can I use to describe this place... awkward, skeevy, Denny's quality, ass-less chaps. I get that some people want a sexy girl to serve them, but when you're sitting at a table and one comes walking up, you're basically giving your order to their pants-less crotches. I also ordered one of those cocktails in a mason jar, and it was so damn sugary. Overall, I would be willing to try a different location, but I'll probably pass on going to this one again."

We had to go up to the bar to order all of our food and drinks because there was no actual server in our section. (The guy we asked for water just said yes to appease us; he was a bartender.) No server in 1/3 of the restaurant for Sunday night Football??\n\n3 bartenders working and I still stood and waited 12 minutes to order a drink. $10.50 for a house bloody mary?! It was served in a very small plastic cup (not even a red Solo cup!) and the mix came from the gun!\n\nAs I waited, I watched the bartenders screw up two orders (gave group A's food to group B and vice versa)... and then proceed to swap everything out after about 2 minutes! Unsanitary! And NO APOLOGY!\n\nThe 3 bartenders, all male, had ZERO personalities and attentiveness. One was just a downright asshole...to me, to my friends, to patrons at the bar.\n\nI even left a long note and my phone number on my credit card slip...and no one had the balls to call me to discuss their atrocious service. They must not care.\n\nThe one star is for the band...they were decent.\n\nAdvice: skip Toby Keith's I Hate This Bar. Way too many great places to go on the Strip."

We got our first Drinks at the Bar. It took the Waitress almost 35mins before she stopped by our table. She never came back. We got our next drinks at the bar while the couple next to us chain smoked. We finally got our table and ordered our food. It took 40mins for the food to come out. I was so hungry at this point I honestly could not tell you if the food was bad. Not trying to be too critical \"Vegas\" but did have different expectations"

Its not a buffet, but everything on the menu is made texas style... BIG! Toby Keith must be a hungry man cause there's no way you can leave that place and NOT be extra full w/ leftovers!\n\nHot girls: the waitresses... super hot here! In addition to that, they are super nice, fast, and attentive. They don't pressure you to upsale you and very familiar with the menu items. I asked them questions about the steak and they were able to answer it!\n\nCelebrities: Eventhough Toby wasn't there... There's live music there! You feel like you're in a special concert with a meal. There was a cover band that was there that did a really good job playing some country music. \n\nWould definitely go back again!"

She forgot several things. \nI will have to say that the portions were huge, I thought the price was high, but wow, massive portions. Also, the food looked awesome. Had the food tastes as good as it looked this would be an amazing place. If you're looking for a place on the strip to eat, pass this place over.\nI've edited this review twice. It's at one star now because after eating there four hours ago I am writhing with pain in my gut and feeling very ill. I know this is vegas and there's booze everywhere but I am not a drinker.

This time we were here the service at the bar was really fun and prompt, we had a few mason jars of beer and an appetizer while we waited for our table.  I wish we would have just stayed at the bar!  Once we were seated it took 15 minutes for the waitress to even acknowledge us, then 40 minutes for our food to come out and my husband's pulled pork sandwich and fries were so cold I actually sent back food for the first time in my entire life.  Once it came back out it was good, and my salad with chicken was perfect.  The greens and veggies were very very cold, and the chicken was perfect.  Also, it was so large that I couldn't finish it...when is the last time that a garden salad was so big you couldn't finish it?  I really appreciated having a good size serving of a healthy option in the sea of gluttony that Vegas can be.  Overall, the atmosphere is really fun if you like country music but I would just grab a seat at the bar and eat there while you are entertained by wonderful bartenders!!"

The bartenders, except one I'll mention below, are always the friendliest compared to most places I have been. \n\nWatch out for one bartender in particular.  To give a better image, he looks Asian.  I asked for two mason jars of my favorite - a long beach.  He got caught up talking to others at the bar, which I could care less, except he ended up giving me two cups of the drink.  When I told him again that I wanted mason jars, he rolled his eyes, poured the cups into jars and added a little bit more of whatever they put in, slammed the jars on the counter, and told me \"$50.\"  I'm not the type to throw a fit, so after paying $44 all weekend, I paid the $50 and still tipped him pretty good.  I was disappointed that my drink tasted like pink lemonade more than how they usually make it, but like I said, I was having fun and didn't want to fuss in public.  I figured I'd let the world know his customer service skills instead of him himself.\n\nEither way, I'll go back every time!"

I've done the cheeseburger, club and wings, all of which were fine. No Food Channel awards, but it was satisfying and the portions were decent.\n\nThe Service\nTable service is a pain point for this place. Every time I've visited, it seems they were shorthand on wait staff. Be prepared to wait if you go there and want table service. I now go to the bar when I visit. The service I've received from the Bartenders is excellent, be it for food or drinks.\n\nThe Atmosphere.\nGood layout, lots of TVs and seating. Audio on sporting events is muted in favor of country music. This was kinda annoying, being it was hockey and basketball playoff season. I then came to grips, realizing this place has Toby's name on the door and country music is king here.\n\nI'll go back if I stay at Harrahs, as its really convenient and you can usually grab a seat at the bar."

Mercifully, since the football game was on, there was no ear-bleed-inducing garbage playing over the sound system, and the bartender was six different shades of hot.  These two reasons are the only thing that kept this review in the two star category.  I got a whiskey and coke and the thing was $10.  Ten!  Shit, I mean I know this is Vegas we're talking about, but this is an establishment that serves its beers in mason jars, so what are we talking about, here?  The food looked atrocious and stale, so I went nowhere near it, and I thank God for that decision, because the guy next to me eating nachos looked like he'd just been socked in the gut about five minutes after finishing his plate.  I didn't see the man again.  Needless to say, my visit to this place was short, and if there is any justice in this world, it will not be repeated."

I got the Baby Back Ribs and had the biggest grin on my bbq-covered face as I savored each bite. Never have I eaten something more delicious. I understand how there are plenty of other places YOU might have been that contradict that, and I just may eat at crappy restaurants, but I am serious when I say it was the best Ribs I have ever eaten. I sampled some food from everyone in my party, and everything was absolutely incredible.\n\nNext: the drinks:\n\nI'll keep this short because I only had one drink (and some of others), but their drinks tasted really good. I only ordered at the table and not the bar, but what I had was delicious and I approve.\n\nThe atmosphere:\n\nFrom what I saw, there was the eating area, a bar, a dance floor, and a stage with live music. The place was very loud, and country music was blaring, but it was entertaining. I have no interest in country music whatsoever but I still enjoyed the music and had a great time. There were dancers on some of the tables that were absolutely gorgeous. I was temped to just be a creeper at the bar because of how beautiful the girls were, but then again, that would be creepy :P\n\nFinally, the staff:\n\nI had no issues at all with the staff. We had not made a reservation so we had to wait maybe 30 minutes (but again, there were dancers, so I didn't mind standing around). When the time to be seated finally came, we were placed right near the stage. It was loud so we requested a different table. They quickly accommodated us and moved us closer to the entrance. The waitress then came by and took our orders, and was on point to bring our appetizers/drink refills whenever needed. Our food was prepared very quickly and everyone's order was perfect.\n\nFinal verdict?\n\nLike I said before, I have only eaten here once. The one time I was there I had an awesome time. I loved the food, the atmosphere, and everything about the place. I told a friend eating with me that I will come back every time I am in vegas, and that I must bring my family there. The food was top notch and the service was great. I highly recommend Toby Keith's and hope you have the same excellent service that I did."

This place is a dump.  \n\nTo begin with, I tried to call the restaurant several times during the week after noon and no one answered.  Finally, they answered.  I just wanted to see if there were any happy hour specials. Geez...\n\nI met up with some girls to start up the evening for a bachelorette party on a Saturday evening.  Not everyone showed up at the same time, so the hostess would not seat us until the entire party was there. (We had 10 girls in our party.)  They also have a sign that says that there is a 90 minute maximum at your table.  Oh yea....they don't take reservations either.  Not to mention 2 of the hostesses were rude and I had to pull answers out of them.  Already not having a great experience, because there is NO level of customer service in this place.  \n\nThe drinks are expensive....$7 for a corona light.  Yes, it's the strip but at Harrah's that seems a bit crazy.  Maybe I should have splurged for the $22 mason jar, but I was the DD and didn't want to get crazy.  Every so often, they blow a whistle or something and someone jumps on the bar to pour some shots into your mouth.  \n\nOnce we sat down, I asked the server if my sister and I could split our bill out.  She made sure to tell us they only split checks a max of 3 ways.  OK what is with this place...can't I catch a break?!  All in all...she ended up splitting the check 4 ways....funny how that worked out.  \n\nThe service was OK and the food was not so great.  Typical strip food....over priced and under delivered.  We only had bar type food...nacho plates, club sandwich and I shared an app platter. The best thing was the fried mac n cheese balls. Not super great but good.\n\nLater that evening about 3 hours after I ate....I had food poisening. Yes, like Linda Blaire!  I am sure it was the chicken wings.  I will be contacting Harrah's and the health department.  I didn't drink so it wasn't that.\n\nAll in all...not a place I would EVER go back to."

Bar and table service can be exceptionally slow. The food ain't much to write home about. The drinks are overpriced and kinda sucky. But you don't come here for the eating and drinking. You come here to walk around, shake your head, and repeatedly say to yourself \"just who the hell does Toby Keith think he is?!\" - and to just watch all the crazy people having a crazy time."

My bro and I finished off burgers with the Fried Twinkie which was actually pretty good. It's not a grease bomb like you'd think.\n\nThey have country music videos playing all the time and when Toby Kieth's \"I Love This Bar\" comes on everyone gets free shots poured directly in the mouth from a chick walking on the bar. Bras hanging above the bar keep the place extra classy.\n\nThe food's good, but I don't think the burger and fries are worth the $13-14 I paid. That's my only complaint. I do believe I'll return with friends so we can eat, drink and dance. Seemed like there was enough space by the video screen for some country dancin' and west coast swing."

Let's give it a go! \n\nThe menu here is burgers and more burgers and is trying hard to make a  memorable impression: drinks served in novelty red plastic cowboy boots (definitely my kinda place! Joke!) Oddly, the water is served in Mason jars. Since that's retro chic I was surprised, as there's nothing chic about this place. Some burgers come stabbed with a steak knife to hold them together.  \n\nAnother surprise was the hostess lady - she walks around in cowboy chaps which isn't that big a deal, but she only wore a pair of modest black knickers underneath, like a bikini bottom. You can't help but stare! This was probably the oddest addition to this potentially wholesome restaurant - a cheeky bit of Vegas twist I guess. Another bit of the entertainment is the music videos playing on the screens. All country music and probably lots of Toby Keith stuff.\n\nMy turkey burger with advocado was ok. It bet it would've tasted better with the fries. I got the potato salad which did seem homemade and not from a plastic box, but who knows what's real in Vegas! :) My waitress said the burger came with fruit, but I didn't see any in my basket. I paid around $15 for the pleasure of this ok/average burger."

I was at a point where I'd agree to pretty much anything.\n\nWe go to this bar, and it was a bit early (barwise) I guess (10:45?  11?) and it was just crowded enough.  There was some line-dancing, some country songs, some non-country songs, a live cover band which had a BEAUTIFUL lead singer... and then a Toby Keith impersonator and a Willie Nelson impersonator.  Though we may have been unsober enough to be rather certain for some period of time that they were REALLY Toby Keith and Willie Nelson.  \n\nSo I definitely had a pretty fantastic time.  There were a few moments with sketchy men, which might be one reason I'm not throwing 5 stars out.  They also don't have a bathroom in the restaurant, so you have to go back into Harrah's, and they wouldn't stamp my hand when I left to go (we got there before the hand stamping started) so it was possible if it got crowded I couldn't get back in (luckily I did, but the uncertainty didn't make me happy).  Also, 6 dollars for a Bud Light makes me a sad panda, even though I know it's Vegas.  I don't even know why I ordered a Bud Light- I don't even LIKE Bud Light.  \n\nHowever, the drinks were totally served in mason jars when I was there, and a bartender poured shots down people's throats for free at some point.  That was pretty fun.  The crowd was also REALLY into the music, which added a lot.  However, there could have been more single cowboys (for my friend, of course...)."

The band was great the night I was there and the bar is nice and large, almost the size of a dance hall.  It's located on the 2nd floor of Harrahs, which is something most people need to know when trying to find this place.  Otherwise, I was not a big fan of this place simply because the domestic beer prices for BOTH bottle and draft were $7 EACH.  I can buy an entire six pack for that price!!  Since it was probably the last time I would ever visit Vegas again in my lifetime, I sucked it up and stayed for a little while.  However, I wouldn't go back.  Since there are very few good choices for country music bars in Vegas, I would recommend this place for those who are desparately looking for a country music bar in Vegas and don't mind paying $7 per beer.  They may have a happy hour with lower prices, but I cannot confirm that.  I know the bands start at 9pm each night and Happy Hour is over by then, if there is one at all."

We had the fried ouch lea for an appetizer. Long spears and fried well. The ranch dip is mild but refreshing. Also, nice to listen to congruent classics in the background.

No, it's not what you think....But there are A LOT of life sized, and larger posters, murals, standing figurines and videos of the country start at this establishment...Many of them featuring his trademark \"Come Hither Cowboy\" look.\nOther than the creepiness....This  sports bar type place was a welcome surprise. Searching for a non-buffet, non-fast food dining option gets hard sometimes during a busy trade show at the adjoining property and I was happy to stumble upon Toby Keith's I love this Bar and Grill. It DOES get VERY crowded on Thurs-Fri and Sat nights so be warned...But for the most part it is a country themed casual eatery with an upbeat vibe.\nThe service both at the tables and at the bar was good, even when busy. The waiters are pretty good ad describing some of the more \"eclectic\" items on the menu such as the fired bologna sandwich or the fried macaroni balls. The food was, I would say, a slight improvement on a Chili's or TGI Fridays type Americana type offering. Several fried southern surprises, as mentioned above...But I had both some appetizers, a salad and a burger, and all came as I ordered and were tasty and a good value. A great combination. HOWEVER, they do offer the \"100oz Challenge\" which, as I had heard was a giant burger, fried and beer..All totaling a combined 100 ounces. This is one of those John Canyd type challenges where you get a \"hootn and a hollerin\" reception when you ordered it, and a TShirt and Polaroid if you finish it...And a double bypass in a year or two.\nAll in all a great dining, and drinking option tucked away in Harrahs Las Vegas. Keep up the good work...Yall!"

            "review": "I hate this bar and grill.  Seriously.\n\nWe had some friends in town that had enjoyed Toby Keith's a few years ago and wanted to go back.  So we made the stop at Harrah's on a late Sunday afternoon.  On the way to the casino, I called ahead to make reservations.  You can't.  So I asked how busy they were, expecting the girl on the other end of the phone to tell me there would be a wait.  Instead, I was told \"We are the opposite of busy.\"  Things weren't looking good already.\n\nWe were immediately seated and I enjoyed the feel of the place.  I'm not into country music but I don't mind it playing in the background.  It's pretty much an Applebee's or TGI Fridays feel, except with a country theme.  But you can only enjoy the scenery for so long....\n\nWe waited, and waited, and waited.  It took at least 15 minutes before our server even came over to greet us and get our drink orders.  Someone in my group wanted one of the specialty mixed drinks that are listed on the back of the menu (the ones that come in mason jars - 19 flipping dollars).  When my friend asked how much a 16-ounce version of the drink would be, she was told it was $12 but it would only come with a half a shot in it.  What??  I'm going to just say that we misheard or she misspoke, because that can't be right at all.  And the bad signs kept on coming....\n\nI would say a good half hour went by before we got our meals.  I ordered the quesadillas with veggies and they were awful.  DRIPPING in grease- I had to blot them with napkins just so I didn't get grease on my clothes.  It was served with some sad shredded iceberg, mushy chopped tomatoes, and a super boring poblano salsa.  I managed to eat half and then called it a day.  $13, but worth $0.\n\nMy husband ordered the Ranch House Salad.  It claims to come with iceberg AND romaine, but there was only iceberg in that bowl.  Unless you're talking about a wedge salad, iceberg lettuce just screams cheap ingredients and that little thought went into making the salad.  He also got a couple of slices of tomato, a little bit of cheese and croutons, and about a tablespoon of corn.  On the side were two enormous containers of ranch dressing- you know, in case you want to eat 1200 calories in salad dressing during your meal.   $12, but worth about $6.\n\nWe also got a side of fries for $5.  They were actually really good (especially with all the leftover ranch from my husband's salad) and the portion was pretty generous.\n\nMy friends ordered the She's a Hottie Wrap and the Steak Sandwich.  I didn't hear anything good or bad about their food or the mason jar drink.\n\nWe then proceeded to wait again for the check and for it to be brought back to sign once we paid.  Our drinks were refilled once the entire time we were there.\n\nWhen it was all said and done, my friend said that a few years ago it was a fun place to be.  Now there's just terrible service despite the fact that the place had zero customers.  There are typical overpriced menu items like you'll find all over the Strip and ridiculous price differences for Harrah's players card members vs. non-card customers.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and go next door to the Venetian and eat at Grand Luxe- similar food and price but better quality and service with a larger menu.  Toby Keith's will do if you are starving and have a broken leg and you can't hop any farther before you pass out from hunger.\n\nOh, and there's a $6 charge if you want to split a meal with someone.  There should be crimes against stupid pricing like this."

            "review": "No, I'm not confused. I am indeed writing a review based on personal experience inside Toby Keith's Bar & Grill at Harrah's.\n\nA friend of mine from NYC (whose father is an executive with Caesars Entertainment, the parent company of Harrah's) decided to use family connections for his birthday dinner...and we all got an invitation that the dinner was to be held at Toby Keith's. Wait, what? I was confused to say the least and had to call other people who I knew were also invited before we figured out what and where Toby Keith's was.\n\nThis place reminds of my college days at the University of Arizona in Tucson: cowboy hats, country music and lots of Jack Daniels bottles used as decoration. There was live music and the main singer looked like a skinnier Toby Keith. The restaurant was loud and our waitresses handled our large (and mostly obnoxious, though in good fun) party very well.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the \"hottie wrap\" which is a sun dried tomato tortilla filled with strips of fried chicken (I know, not part of my usual diet but with all the Jack Daniels decorations around I felt fried anything was appropriate somehow) and lots of veggies. My guilty conscience made me ask for fat free ranch instead of bleu cheese. The wrap tasted fresh and everyone enjoyed their food. Orders ranged from burgers, to wings, to mac & cheese.\n\nI'm not going to lie, our party of 20 people had an awesome time. Everything was on the house so needless to say the drinks were flowing. I didn't partake in any of the speciality cocktails because they all come in giant mason jars. I wanted something a little daintier. Oh, and to make things interesting some man (in hindsight I pray it was the bartender) came around with a bottle and gave everyone in our party (guys and girls) shots. The atmosphere was very fun and it was a great birthday dinner setting for a loud group."

I am a business executive and I travel to Vegas about 5 times per year over the last 10 years or so.  I stumbled into Toby Keith's about 5 years ago, and I can honestly say it is the one place I look forward to going to every trip.  It doesn't disappoint.  It feels like home even though I'm from the O.C. and I'm not a huge Country fan.  My man Jay Bird has always made the experience fun at the bar.  He's a great guy to have a laugh with.  He makes drinks with this whole flair process with bottles and tumblers and glasses flyin' every which way before it all lands cleanly in your glass.  Very entertaining.  I usually go here in the evening, but this week I decided to have lunch here.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, Mac & Cheese balls, and the tortilla soup.  In the background, I was entertained by Toby Keith's mostly hilarious music videos.  Food came reasonably fast.  The food was really good. Unexpectedly good.  I washed that down with a mason jar of my favorite beverage and I felt like I had great experience for a reasonable value."

A large screen playing music videos and some smaller ones all around with both tunes and NASCAR, will be the background noise to your dining experieince.  Loves it!  I first saw one of these places while driving through Nashville and have been wanting to eat here ever since!\n\nThe girls working are in chaps and the eye candy was excellent! Our server was Rhonda and she did a fantastic job. Totally on top of it and delivered great service through the whole meal. I ordered a house salad ($11.99) and when it arrived I could tell it would feed me another meal or two, so I asked for a to-go container before dressing it. She brought me one (which I filled with salad) and even brought me a lid for the extra dressing. They must get this a lot! The two cups of dressing were huge!\n\nMy husband had some sort of big club sandwich that he enjoyed ($15.99). We both had a drink and enjoyed the large mason jars - you don't have to check on a table as often because it takes longer to empty a drink (not sure why some places use such small glasses). With our check, Rhonda brought to-go cups as well and made sure our glasses were full.  When you're paying $3.50 for each glass this makes you feel a little better about it.  That's expensive beveraging!! Service was superior to most places of similar value. And it wasn't just her, we saw lots of hard-working employees and bussers. Everyone doing their job well and providing a pleasant dining atmosphere. \n\nSign up for a player's card! Your Total Rewards card from Flamingo works in the Harrah's Hotel where this Grill is. We didn't realize this and so we missed out on a couple of dollars savings from each meal. Bummer! They must be sister hotels - wish I'd known that it worked at more than one! It was too late by the time we figured this out.\n\n($37.81 for lunch)"

I had asked the waiter if it was a half or full order, and he said half. It was HUGE! And it was only $8! I was set on that, and a friend also ordered their fried mac and cheese balls. Was excited to try it!\n\nThe fried mac and cheese ball was dissapointing. Flavorless, even with their spicy ranch sauce.\n\nWhen our entrees came out, they were HUGE! No one could finish their food! My nachos were really good, was quite surprised, and we could barely put a dent in it. Their french fries, although could be cooked a little longer, were really tasty as well.\n\nAll in all, a good cheap meal, and we left just as the live band started rocking out. A p plus is using your Total Rewards card for a discount as well."

Doesn't take reservations and 2. Wanted us to wait 2 hours to eat. Ha ha! No thanks Guy. And BTW - no reservations? Come on.\n\nFirst TK's has a fun atmosphere, but looks like a normal 'ol bar and grill. The walls are decorated with Toby Keith... things, and all the girls wear panties and chaps. Ass in your face every time your server leaves your table. Speaking of service, it could be improved. After we were seated we waited a good 10 minutes to put our order in, luckily, since we all had sufficient time we all knew what we wanted to eat and drink.\n\nOnward to the food - steak fajitas, which came out sizzling and made me excited. But when were placed in front of me were a let down. The beef was haphazardly cut and chunky, not strips. Plus the meat was not seasoned in anyway and it looked just WRONG to me. Fajitas come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. I picked corn - half of them were not steamed enough and had hard edges. They brought them out in a tortilla holder with NO LID. What the heck? No wonder it did not steam all the way. Dear manager of TK's: put lids on your tortilla holders and customers will get tortillas that are soft! My fajitas also came with: rice (OK), refried beans (OK), salsa (not spicy at all), guac (OK), and sour scream (OK). Overall what could be a great dish, only mediocre.\n\nNext - \"I Love This Bar\" BBQ Sandwich - my mother requested no sides for her sandwich, but they brought her fries anyway. She said the BBQ sandwhich could use more BBQ sauce. \n\nChicken Fried Steak - My brother had this and said it was so-so, not a REAL chicken fried steak in my family's opinion because it didn't appear to be pan-fried, which is the honest way to make a chicken fried steak - not deep frying it with a lot of breading. Speaking of breading...\n\nMy husband's fish and chips were mostly breading which he peeled off so he could actually eat the fish.\n\nLastly, the shrimp appetizer which my father ordered for his meal came with a HUGE amount of deep fried little shrimp. There had to have been 20 and it came with a tasty, creamy cajun-flavored dipping sauce. I really liked the shrimp.\n\nOverall - I feel as though there could be a lot of improvement. I like Toby Keith. I like the idea of the restaurant - I really like all the country music they were playing, but the food was a huge downer."

It is always fun with dancing, flare bartenders, mason jars, and birthday \"shots\". \n\nI actually prefer to come here during the day because most of the bartenders are really personable and you get a really cool show while they throw bottles around and pour 20 shots at a time in a pyramid. They are able to talk with you moer and spend more time showing off their cool tricks than they are at night when it is super busy. AND they still play the Toby Keith song, \"I Love This Bar\" during the day- which means free shots! \n\nI keep coming back to this place despite the fact that I am not that big into country music and I absolutely despise Toby Keith. So, that really says something about how fun this bar is!\n\nLast note, go on your birthday and order the birthday shot. Trust me :)"

Everyone else had great things to say about the food. As for the prices, it's Vegas, of course they are going to be high. This was one of the cheaper dinners we had though, my burger and fries were only $15..I paid 20+ for muuuuch worse throughout the weekend.

I dont really go for the food, though.The drinks are huge and the bartenders have always been really attentive and fast (especially Jimmy:)) They make free shots every so often, and you will get drunk fast.

I saw a lot of the bartenders and wait staff either sitting talking to one another or talking \"too long\" to just one customer.  They are friendly but when I need a drink I don't need you to be talking to another customer for 15 mins.  Great food but service stinks.  \n\nMake sure to bring your players card.  You get like $2 off each entree..."

Once we got a menu (with not being asked what we would like to drink- hello? we are sitting at a BAR..) the bartender came back 15 minutes later to wash a glass and I had to let him know we were ready to order. He asked \"what do you want?\". It then took 20 minutes to get one order of appetizer chicken strips. The man who brought it out to us was very nice and polite and was the one to finally ask if we wanted something to drink. It of course took another 20 minutes after being done eating to get the idiot bartenders attention to ask for our bill. Needless to say- we did not tip. I am a big believer in cutting slack because servers/bartenders etc get busy- but really? 4pm on a Tuesday with 8 people at the bar, 5 of them flirting to get on the bartenders good side?

We were still purchasing drinks (or attempting to, but the waitress stopped coming to our table) and still eating our food, as we ordered appetizers first and then our entrees. I could understand the restaurant trying to get rid of our table if we were simply sitting there for hours sipping on water and not spending more money, but it was quite the opposite. The manager (Haley) came to our table when asked and was very rude and had no explanation as to why this was happening. Do not go here for a sporting event if you plan to watch the whole game.

But since everyone was famished, and they wanted to eat NOW, they chose the closest restaurant to our stop.\n\nWe were greeted by the hostess as we walked through the entrance. She was very pleasant and nice. This seemingly impromptu choice by my family seemed like it would turn out to be a good choice. The place was brightly lit, clean, spacious, and there were not that many patrons so we had plenty of great seats to choose from.\n\nThe hostess grabbed the menus, exited from the booth that she was situated in, and led us to our table. Now, the punch line here is that as we followed her; none of us could help but notice the fact that she was wearing chaps and nothing was covering her rear except for very small (and nearly non-existent) panties.\n\nWell, this was a great choice - Family!? I had this perplexed look on my face, as I stared onto my wife's and daughter's grinning faces!\n\nDerri\u00e8re's aside, and there was plenty of it, the food and the service were actually not bad. Our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our needs.\n\nI had the All American Burger, that this monstrosity of a sandwich could've fed all of us. It seemed as if the quoted weight of this burger was post cooking, because It definitely was too big to hold with one hand - let alone put any part of it in my mouth.\n\nMy wife had the Ribeye, and she indicated that it was well seasoned, and properly prepared.\n\nThe rest had various sandwiches, BBQ Beans, and Mac & Cheese. Everything tasted good.\n\nThis seemingly humorous departure from our normal dining venues proved both fun, relaxing and surprisingly satisfying. And by the time we were ready to leave, the lights were dimmed and the crowds started to roll in. Apparently, after a certain time, there is a band that plays on the stage, and country dancing ensues.\n\nWe didn't stick around for that, but we left satisfied!"

Toby Keith I HATE YOUR BAR & GRILL.\n\n I would rather stay home and get a third degree burn in my mouth from a Lean Pocket than ever dine at this type of place, but sometimes it's not about what I want. \n\nIt was my sister's birthday and her and my mother love country music and Toby Keith in particular. My mom had mentioned she wanted to take my sister here so I took the bull by the horns and made it happen. Big mistake.\n\nWe all know there are outstanding restaurants on the strip that are worth every over priced dime that you spend. Not this one. This falls into the other category. The Over Priced Food That Just Sucks Themed Restaurants.\n\nStill, I can get past the price just to make people I love happy, but not this time. In a nutshell.\n\nThe food wasn't terrible. My sister ordered meatloaf potato skins with gravy for our appetizer. This was creative, yet under seasoned, but still I was thinking this would be cool to recreate at home for one of my dinner parties. Maybe with sweet potatoes.\n\nNext we each had a sandwich which does not include fries and my sister added fries. My sandwich was a grilled BBQ chicken sandwich which wasn't terrible at all. I could only eat half and brought the rest of the chicken home to my dog. One Coke, two well drinks and $95 LATER!!!!!!! Fuck me.\n\nLike I said, I can get over the price, but the waitress broke my number one rule. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY AND SHE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR MY SISTER. Not that we expected a lap dance or Toby Keith to serenade us in tight jeans, but something! I made it a point to tip the busser and have her tell the waitress about the birthday (let me say those girls are the ones hustling in this joint) . The waitresses merely take your order and then hand you your check at the end. Other than that they do shit. It's all about the bussers. Our busser  was on point and I know she told the waitress. Well Sue or Suzie our blonde waitress brought me the bill and I mentioned it to her and she just looked at my sister and said, \"Happy Birthday\". I wanted to rip her Lee Press-On nails right off. Well, I tipped her accordingly and then tipped the busser again.\n\nIf mediocre, overpriced, under seasoned bar food and country music is your thang than you will be in hog heaven with the trailer park beauties servin' it up. If you are looking to spoil someone you love on their birthday with a simple scoop of vanilla ice-cream and a feckin' candle than do not come here."

Best thing about this bar is the menu: Southern Food.\n\nThe menu is varied but I get the same thing almost everytime, a fried bologna sandwich, or as I like to call it: Welfare steak. a big ole slice of bologna with fried onions and cheese on toasted bread. Comes with either fries or tater salad. Where I come from, we put mustard in the tater salad but Tobey don't so I'm not crazy about it. It's ok, just not great.\n\nThe wife likes to order side dishes like fried okra, pickles, mac n cheese balls, and meatloaf. This time, along with a couple of sides, she ordered the Chicken n Dumplings soup. First time she ordered this and wasn't crazy about it. She said it didn't have enough dumplings in it.\n\nI have no idea why she ordered this. She makes the best chicken n dumplings I ever tasted which is why I never order any anywhere.\n\nOk, usual complaint but not really complaining.

Any other city I would never pay $13 bucks for a bologna sandwich but you're here so don't complain and enjoy.\n\n(Come to think about it, where else you going to get a fried bologna sandwich other than Dollywood?)\n\nLive music and live crowds, free shots at the bar when the bell rings, and lot's of fun."

Our server is what made it over the top amazing. \nWe had Jessica and her personality is one of those who you want to be friends with but stayed on top of her tables flawlessly and never was far if you needed her. Food and drinks were impeccably delicious. And the whole staff was great. I'll be back just because our server alone!"

When I asked the waitress what kind of beer they had on tap and she said \"Busch.\"  I stared back at her, waiting, hoping to coax another selection out of her, but she was done with her list.  We were in it for the full experience of drinking out of a mason jar, so we were stuck with Busch.\n\nWe looked at menu items such as \"Star Spangled Salad\" and \"Knock Yourself Out\" Nachos before settling on the equally healthy fried Mac and Cheese.  The order arrived with four or five large sized brown balls.  They were a little too hot to pick up, so we cut into them with a fork and knife.  The taste was pretty good, but I recommend you share it with someone unless you hate your heart.\n\nDuring our visit there was a live country band playing as people danced.  The bartenders were up and about doing all sorts of drink pouring tricks the entire time.  It seemed like a place that could get pretty rowdy, but it was very tame that night.  In the end there are places in Vegas that you'll love more than this bar."

On to the positive because I really hate having to write anything negative unless I think it will really help someone else.  The food here has always been good, I've never ordered something and wished I hadn't, but to be fair I seem to wind up ordering the fried bologna sandwich every single time!  I guess it's a guilty pleasure, 15 bucks for a bologna sandwich is kinda steep though don't ya think?  I mean Bologna is the cheapest lunchmeat you can buy at the deli counter isn't it?!?\n\nThe beer here is the normal mix of stuff.. I remember really liking getting my mason jar full of Miller Lite in the past... yeah yeah I know what you're thinking... chubby man orders fried bologna but is worried about the calories in his BEER! ... I just like the taste of it dammit, I'm sure as hell not dieting!   But alas I've got another complaint, I ordered a miller lite draft and it says right on the menu $6 and when I ordered the waitress didn't say anything other than bottle or draft... DRAFT of course, I can drink it out of the bottle at home!   SOOOOO anyway out comes a HUGE mason jar filled with hoppy goodness and it was literally a quart!  So the mrs and I have a conversation about what a good deal that is at a strip-staruant!   Well bill time comes and I got charged $9, still not a bad price considering it was really two pints but FALSE ADVERTISING and the waitress should be clear if there is an extra charge.  I still did not get any satisfaction as to why it was $9 and it says $6 domestic on the menu.  \n\nAll in all, I will definitely be back again it just won't be too soon without better pricing or maybe a locals night/special.   ATTENTION MANAGEMENT!  Do the waitresses really need to be walking around with their tan asses hanging out?  I'd be just as happy if they seated me while wearing a burka!"

Until then, I highly suggest avoiding this venue unless these actions are what you seek when visiting the Toby Keith Bar and grill."

I thought I would be, because I'm a HUGE country music fan, and even admit to a grudging appreciation of/liking for Toby Keith's music. Which is good, because you can't look around the bar without seeing a zillion pictures of the guy. So if you disagree with his right-wing views and occasionally racist song lyrics, this probably isn't the place for you.\n\nHOWEVER, if you like paying $8 for an aluminum bottle of Bud Light, this is definitely the place for you. I'd question your intelligence, because cheaper (or free) beer is readily available in Las Vegas, but hey. If you like artery-hardening fried food that claims to be \"Southern\" by virtue of its being fried, this is definitely the place for you.** And most importantly, if you like your meal to be interrupted at random intervals by ear-piercing whistles, music volume suddenly cranked to 11, and sadly unattractive (and fully clothed, but maybe that's a relief) male bartenders dancing and cavorting on the bar, well then, this is DEFINITELY the place for you.

The band was excellent, and the drinks were made with generous pours.  They should be, my husband and I had 3 drinks each and he had a shot of JD with Honey,  the bill was $70, a bit pricey in my opinion.  The second time was to eat dinner.  My husband's active duty and got the free burger with fries and a beer, I got the fried catfish.  The food was very good, service was excellent.  I have to knock of a couple of stars for the overpriced drinks and for the price you should get your food served in something better than a wire basket."

Only reason I went was because of a colleague wanting to desperately to go to it. \n\nLocation:\nThe Bar and Grill is located in the dark depths of Harrahs. For Vegas, this is an indicator for a bottom tier restaurant. The patrons attracted to this locale are often those that are above mid 40s, Harrahs itself is like a retirement community so it comes off as no surprise. \n\nMenu:\nThe food menu consists of anything but save a few healthy options, salads are the only choice. Other than the salads, you can tell in the quality and portions of food why obesity runs rampant in America. The food is everything that can almost be thought of when you think of a southern dive bar. \n\nBeverages:\nThe choices of beverage is limited in beer, but the cocktails make up what is lacking in the frothy pours. Cocktails are a little new concoction and a little twisted oldies. Depending on the bartender, the bar can make drinks to ones specification."

We were seated quickly (I'll give 'em that), but the service was anemic at best.\n\nThe food arrived, and my girlfriend and I sat there munching stoically without comment for a few minutes. We were both hungry, and even though I had several comments, I kept them to myself for that initial interval. Finally, she broke down and said \"Any good?\"\n\nI replied: \"Well, it tastes like the boot, right after Toby Keith pulled it out of Al Qaeda's ass!\" - and then I illustrated my point by taking a sharp bite with my canines and holding it down for ten seconds, and showing her that I hadn't made a dent in the meat!\n\nToby, a couple of suggestions for you:\n1. Leave the jingoistic songs to someone who does *not* own a restaurant, and concentrate on upgrading your food from \"horrible\" to \"barely passable\" - this will be a huge step forward.\n2. If you must involve yourself with patriotic activities, please wrap care packages of your food and drop it off between the Afghan/Pakistan border. After two days, I'm positive they'll surrender. Your menu selections will do more damage than the MOAB.\n\nThey do take plastic and the monorail will drop you off pretty close, but I'd recommend going elsewhere, even if you're on your last vestige of strength and absolutely must eat. This restaurant has probably lost Toby more fans than his singing ever will."

If you like to dance, you can enjoy yourself right under the stage even if you don't have a partner.\n\nFood was good and I definitely enjoyed my ribs, although a little bit too much on the sweet side for my tastes (I prefer them to be heavily smoked).

We were staying in Treasure Island so it was basically across and up the street for a 10 minute walk to Harrah's (somewhere upstairs).  It was a Tuesday night and we had about a 15-20 minute wait to get seated so we hung out at the bar.  The first thing to catch the eyes were the waitresses (maybe it was the oufit with the cowboy hat, boots and shorts and/or the friendly personalities?).  The service was also pretty good though the dinner entrees took a while to get served.  The appetizers were decent enough - wings, nachos (w/grilled chicken, guacomole, sour cream, tomatoes, etc.) and shrimp hush puppies.  The disappointments were the dinner entrees.  Not one of the five of us were thrilled with the dinner entrees.  The flat iron steak was sort of tough and not very tasty, the rotisserie chicken was dry, the grilled ny steak was sort of bland, the meatloaf was also somewhat cold and bland and the beer battered shrimp was more batter than shrimp.  We were there too early for the band, but there was some kind of free shot thing at the bar that they did at least once while we were there, though one waitress mentioned that the shot of whatever was watered down.  Probably won't go back next time we are in Vegas, but might be worth trying out at least one time.  There's also a poker room in the back that we were told was only open on the weekends.  Oh, and did I mention the waitresses?"

All of a sudden we are informed but a security gard that the dance floor is part of the bar, even though it is in the restaurant, and that our teenage girls had to get off the dance floor. Keep in mind they are all real dancers and not drunks staggering around with a beer in their hand and it is hard for them to hear music and not be compelled to do what they do best. \n\nAnyway in the end after complaining that we did not think a restaurant that allowed families should have this sort of policy banning their customers from dancing, we were basically escorted out of the restaurant by the security as the manager didn't want to deal with our argument.

Our table was lost in awesome conversation until we noticed my wife stuck on one of the TVs. They played 3 Luke Bryan videos back to back so we lost her for a bit. They have a bar you can sit at if you don't want to sit at a table or booth.\n\nI had a Fried Mac and Cheese ball that was average. I was craving a burger so I looked over the menu to see what sounded good. I went with the Hottie Burger. The burger came with a hot link on it as well fried onions, lettuce, tomato and pepper jack cheese. The burger was cooked to my liking and tasted really good. The only complaint is that it was spicy at all. Not even a hint of heat. For a burger with a name \"Hottie\" in it you'd expect it to have a kick. While the burger was very good.... I would suggest they add some fried jalapenos in place of the fried onions. My wife had the Hottie Wrap and felt the same way. She said it tasted great and the amount of guacamole and other stuff inside her wrap was great but the chicken had no heat at all. The Fried Bologna sandwich yelper Anna got was effing interesting. I left stuffed. That's all."

My brothers are huge country music fans and they had to come eat here. I was surprised by how much I liked the food. It was really good. I figured they go off the name and skate on the rest. I was wrong about this. The first time I was here I had the fried bologna sandwich  I liked it. I was expecting a bunch of regular thin deli Bologna but it was a thick slice grilled to perfection. I know we ordered an appetizer I think it was the wings or it came with wings the second time. I remember wings for sure. They were good but I'm not a big wing guy so they were passable but didn't wow me. I had a burger and it was good, but I expected it to be after our previous trip. Service is fine nothing to write home about. Sometimes it can be a little slow on the refills. The location in Harrah's is up stairs I the back. Way in the back. It's a bit of a haul if you're on the strip. But not bad. If you're driving to this part of he strip self park at Harrah's and you'll walk right by on you're way in. Overall a good choice when you're in Harrah's."

Hostess were so worried about calling names into a microphone. \n\nSecond,the places was silent. For a country bar I would expect music. The first 20 minutes there all I heard was the hostess calling names over the PA system. Finally a cover band got on stage. The band looked very out of place and looked like they should be playing heavy metal not country. \n\nThird, our WAITress, Felicia, was by far the worst part. We sat for about 5 minutes before she brought us water. We immediately placed our order since we were seeing a trend. About 25 min later we got our food. however the table next to us who had been there longer never got theirs. The guy also had an empty beer for about 20 minutes. He had to chase her down to check on the food. Eventually they just walked out. We also saw another table walk out without even getting water. Not once during our meal did she come over to check on us. I didn't even get a refill on my water. Finally got the bills and Felicia came over with another plate of food in her hand and asked if we needed a to-go box? Uh we didn't order anything else.

We just wanted something quick so we ordered the bbq wings and fried pickles. The bbq wings were delicious, they were big wings and smothered in bbq with some extra on the bottom. For $12 though, it was pricey for 8 wings but hey, when in Vegas! The fried pickles were decent but nothing too special. The other items on the menu didn't look too bad but definitely overpriced for most items like ribs and fries even with a discount. \n\nThe customer service was good but she was a bit slow. We waited at the table for 5-7 minutes just to be acknowledged by someone and get some water that tasted like tiolet. Then we had to wave her down to get napkins and later on for the check since she never came to our table. It was not very pleasing to the eye when the girls are a little bit bigger and they are wearing booty shorts that show half their butts. Just saying. Besides that, the food was decent. I'm not a country music fan, but I knew and heard of Toby Keith before. It was funny seeing him everywhere with pictures of himself posing on the walls and basically a shrine to myself throughout the place.

My expectations for Harrah's wasn't high at all, and it met those expectations.\n\n\"I Love This Bar\" was basically the Hard Rock Cafe for Country meets Coyote Ugly. The place was loaded with Toby's records and hats and shirts he wore at certain events. The staff was sexy delicious. The outfits were as follows: cowboy hat, little black shirt that reads \"HOTTIE\", black booty panties, and black assless leather chaps. Possibly the greatest work uniform of all time? I think so.\n\nThe food was just ok. I got a western burger and it was gigantic. The fries were \"crusty\" and meh. Toby's \"I Love This Bar\" song and video came on and they announced free shots - so I ran over to the bar where the bartenders dump it straight from bottle inti to your mouth. Not a spritz either, like fill your mouth from throat to lips. Savage style. I kinda like it. Just because Mom had to try it - we got the Deep Fried Twinkie for dessert. When in Rome...\n\nAll in all, a cool place to drink and fantasize about your server. Food was pretty decent. I've got a new respect for TK.

            "review": "Our first night in Vegas we got in late and really had no idea where to eat.  Starving as we walked the strip we found our way into Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill.  The name of this place not withstanding, it didn't seem too bad atmosphere wise.  Our waitress was nice and attentive, and my group of friends all seemed to dig the faux country atmosphere despite being from New Jersey and having no connection to the country at all.   \n\nBut yeah, the food, what this review is all about.  Suffice to say I was not impressed.  Looking at the menu I had a slight heart attack.  All the options seemed to be highly unhealthy and likely to send you into a food coma after eating them.  Ok, I understand that this isn't Trader Joe's and can deal with that if the food is good.  I decided to pick what I figured to be the healthiest thing on the menu, the Chicken Caesar wrap.  The rest of my group got Fried Bologna sandwiches and one pasta with Alfredo sauce.  \n\nMy Chicken Caesar wrap for lack of a better word, sucked.  The wrap had very little chicken, and was mostly packed with lettuce (no tomato or onions).  This may have been somewhat tolerable if the chicken and lettuce weren't drenched in a watery slop they call Caesar dressing.  When I eat a wrap, I don't want it to leak.  I was really disappointed and so disgusted by the dressing I barely ate it (and I'm not a remotely picky eater).  Everyone else liked their dishes ok, but nobody polished off their plate or was really impressed.  \n\nIf you come to this place skip the food- go to Capriotti's earlier in the day and buy a sub to save for dinner.  You'll save time, money, and yourself from a subpar meal."

So once you are seated, you keep getting jolted by the loud \"party of 4!\" Screams. \nThe service was very slow. We were seated before another couple yet, somehow their food arrived before us and they had steak and we didn't. The food was decent, not bad, definitely not worth waiting for and nothing to rave about. Not worth the price of the food or the wait. There are so many other options in vegas to choose from. \nAlso, as a side note, my aunt has been to the other TLBG location and said what a disappointment this one is compared to the great food and service at one in California."

When we sat down with the menu I noticed that my first option wasn't on there. I asked the waitress where the prime rib is that's on their website and she said 'oh that's an old menu.' So onto my second item which was the BBQ Rotisserie chicken. Yeah they sold out of that earlier today. I can tell at this point this is not going to go well. I ordered the sirloin medium rare and asked the waitress how the green beans were made. She stated they are cooked in butter and garlic - so I was in. When the dinner arrived my steak was cooked as ordered but had no taste to it. I don't think they seasoned it at all. The green beans had no flavor either. The mashed potatoes were good so that's why they get three stars. We were not impressed and won't be back!"

I had the pulled pork which is my sandwich of choice that I base places on and the BBQ sauce was amazing - I bought a bottle before we left.  My husband had the chicken fried steak and loved it also.  \n\nThe second time we went last year, we showed up when they opened at 11am, grabbed a barstool, and left at 5pm.  We had met up with friends of mine from high school that I hadn't seen since high school (16 years!).  The bartenders were awesome for the whole 6 hours, and as much as I loathe domestic brews, the 2 for 1 specials allowed us to have a low tab and be sufficiently drunk.  I love all the free shots when they play the signature song, too!  I still had plenty of Shiner Bocks and a few mixed drinks and a few shots of Jager along with a plate of nachos and we left there with a bill of $45.  I can't wait til the next time we're in Vegas to spend some more time there.\n\nIt's very convenient to get to from the monorail, but pretty far back in Harrah's off the strip.

I came here on a Thursday night, and got in at about 10:30. No ID check, No cover charge, just walk on in and head up to the bar. Very cool.\nThere was a live band playing, but they were very, very good. Played mostly country, but threw in some old classics to get people on the dance floor. It's a very modern country type atmosphere, and a LOT of fun. Noticed the bras hanging all around the bar, always kind of funny to notice the different sizes and styles. \nAll the drinks are served up in mason jars, pretty cool. Lots of beers on tap, although I decided with a Long Island Ice Tea. Very strong, and very good. Since it was my birthday, the bartender hooked me up with a free shot. Not quite sure what it is, but free booze is free booze. After about 30 minutes, the band decided to take a break, and a live DJ started up playing country hits, announcing FREE SHOTS at the bar. And boy, they weren't kidding. EVERYBODY made their way over to the bar, and the bartenders hooked everyone up with a free shot. Of course, the beautiful ladies had it poured into their mouth from the large dispenser, as it should be.\nThe bartenders were very cool, made some very cool drinks, and were very interactive with all the people hanging at the bar. The band was pretty damn good, and had a LOT of people on the dance floor. One young lady, TRASHED beyond belief, had everyone's attention, especially after throwing her panties to the drummer. A lot of folks boot scootin' and doing the electric slide. \nGood music, good times, and not a bad price. Definitely recommend this place as a chill alternative to the night clubs that dominate the Vegas scene. Stop in, relax, enjoy some good country, and drink your face off."

I go to Las Vegas at least twice year, and I go to Toby Keith's every time we are down in Vegas and we never had a bad time there.  Always has good live music playing during the night, even got to see Toby Keith sing one time.\n\nThis was the third time we have gone to Toby Keith's for their Superbowl party.  Got in line to get time at around 10am like last year.  Doors opened at noon.  First noticed that they didnt arrange the tables into long rows like they did in the past, but whatever a lot of places leave their restaurant area tables alone during special events.  We took a table in the of the restaurant area because there were five of us in the group.  The screen that we had seemed smaller that what was there last year but that could have been just due to how much further away to it we were.  The buffet was the same as years past, decent nothing to write home about.\nNow the reason I am writing this review.  The service was ... hmm, I cannot come up with the best word to describe how bad it was.  As part of the package you get 4 bottles of either Coors Light or Miller Light.   I would have drank way more than that in the coarse of the 6 and half hours we were there.   Between the time we sat down to half-time (about 4 hours) I had 4 beers.  I ordered a beer every time our waitress came by.   Yes I am saying in 4 hours we got checked on 4 times.  This whole time I am watching the tables around us get checked on by their waitresses multiple times and even asked a few to help us for absent waitress.   \nA little way into the third quarter our waitress returns to us to tell us that she needs to close out as its the end of her shift.  Okay fine.  Lets hope the next one will check on us more.... not really sure there was ever was anyone else assigned to our table because it wasn't till the fourth quarter I finally complained to a \"manager\" about the lack of service.  He said he would take care of this.  Sweet, a new waitress showed up took our next round.... And we didnt see her again.  So at this point Toby Keith's will not be seeing us next year as we will be at a different Casino's Superbowl party."

The drinks were ok, and the bar had a lot of seats.... no cover charge or waiting in line either. It's more casual attire than dressy.  Bartenders put on a good show - bottle flipping, stacked shots, free shots, and some kind of simulated fellatio act with a loud alarm for the bachelorette parties. \n\nAlthough I had fun with my friends, I was a little disappointed by the overall experience. Call me crazy, but it didn't seem \"country enough.\" I mean, I wasn't expecting hay and cowboys, but the cover band was kid of a let down. They played some country hits, and some rock hits (Come on Eileen, Take on Me, etc) but they weren't that great and then they just started playing a couple hip hop songs to keep people dancing...but, hello, you can't really dance to a cover version of \"California Love\"....um no.\n\nMy vote.... look for a legit C&W bar somewhere off the strip - not this commercialized space - or just go back to another swanky Vegas club..."

It was the worse experience I've ever had.  \n\nI had called a week before to make a reservation for 12, because their website said they recommend reservations for 12 or more.  However, I talked to the manager and she said, they wouldn't be taking reservations because that weekend because of March madness and her suggestion was to come an hour early and put my name on a list.  So, I did just that, however, I was told by the hostess that she couldn't hold a table for me or seat me until all of my party is there.  Wish the manager would have told me that when I called.  No communication between management and staff and that's why they get poor ratings.  \n\nBasically, if you're going to have a large party in your group, call ahead of time and get details of reservations, seating requirements, etc. before you arrive.  \n\nIt was a frustrating experience and I won't go there again with a large party."

We stayed at The Cosmopolitan and we walked late the first night so it wasn't terribly hot all the way to Harrah's stopping to watch the cool sidewalk shows and random attractions of people.Then we walked the second  time in the early evening when it was about 107 out all the way to Harrah's again! Ridiculous walk! But worth it. Plus right outside of Harrah's there is a outside bar/club Carnaval I think it was called and they have a booth that makes enormous drinks for about 40$ and we got one of those to keep us company. ;)\n\nGood food, excellent service, great fun atmosphere. At first I was hesitant to go to a country based bar since that's never really been my cup of tea, but to my surprise, I had a great time! On Saturday night there was a live band singing cover songs, they did an excellent job! The woman could really sing! There were people swing dancing and line dancing all over. It was a good time. Our waitress was the little blonde woman, she had so much energy and was the sweetest cutest waitress ever. She rocked the heck out of her butt-less chap outfit with the rhinestone booty shorts! My husband and I ordered a hamburger and a quesadilla and split the two. Food was good. We also got the mason jar of the Georgia Peach. It was good, but a little bit too sweet for me. \n\nThe second night (Sunday night) there was no live band, must be a Saturday only thing. We ordered Toby's Big Daddy Platter. It was delicious. I have never had deep fried macaroni and cheese balls, not sure if I would ever particularly order it but I loved it from there! I got a Ranch House salad (which was huge for the price). Don't remember exactly what my husband ordered but he loved it. We also got the boot souvenir drink cup this time filled with The Patriot I believe. We asked for the least sweet tasting one on the menu and it was delicious. Got to take the boot home back to California. \n\nThis is a fun place for all ages! I will definitely come here again when I take another trip to Vegas. I forgot to mention this place is pretty affordable, the drinks were strong and fairly priced and the food was decently priced and you got a lot of it!!"

When we say no, we actually want to order a drink that costs MONEY, she asks if the \"maitre D\" sat us there.  \nI explained the situation above to her and in a snotty way she says she has to go ask the manager if we can be served!!

So after making us feel like we're F' N beggars in this P.O.S joint, I go up front and ask to speak to the manager, I explain the situation to the sad excuse for a manager and he proceeds to look at me sarcastically and starts to side with this broad!!!  So I explain to him that he is in V-E-G-A-S and that people are coming there to spend their hard earned money and should at least get a little bit of courtesy and respect but he couldn't hear me because obviously the guy doesn't have a clue, as to what customer service is.  \n\nMr. Toby Keith should send this moron SIMS or whatever his name is, to work in the collections department or bathroom because he has NO CLUE as to what SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY OR ANY HOSPITALITY IS!!!!

The server was great.\n\nThe second time I was in a group and the food was all average. Nothing stood out and nobody in the group had good things to say when leaving. There was a fair variety of meals ordered from fish and pork to burgers. It was just average chain restaurant food. The server sucked but was wearing assless chaps and underwear. That seems good till she bends over pick up a fork dropped at the table next to you. That is interesting to say the least! \n\nThey do have fair priced drinks. They use mason jars for beers and mixed drinks which is pretty cool. My wife once ordered a mason jar mixed drink for around 14 dollars and it was to strong for her. I tried it and it was on the strong side, but I would rather that than the alternative. \n\nAll in all, I will not return to this location for dinner, maybe for drinks and appetizers at best..."

The cheese sticks are made with jack and bleu cheese, and I believe when they are breaded, they are dipped in buffalo sauce. They come with either ranch or bleu cheese dressing, and they are a great twist to the traditional mozzarella sticks. \nThe mason jars are on the expensive side, avg. $19, but they are big and last a while. They have good burgers, and yummy crispy steak fries, and almost every meal is a little over-sized.  \nMy biggest gripe is the service, all of the hostess' and waitress' are women, and many of them are snotty. First off, they are walking around with chaps and their asses hanging out, that might be one of the reasons for their uptight attitude, and they can be very rude. The most recent time my husband and I came here with my in-laws, our waitress was horrible. She never cracked a smile, rammed into my purse almost knocking it down (it was hanging on my chair and she didn't apologize or even look back), and she forgot my mother-in-law's drink because, \"oh, uh, someone just handed me back there check and I haven't had a chance to pick up your drink from the bar.\" Have someone else run it for you half wit! She's lucky my father-in-law paid, because I would not have left her sour-puss face 1 red cent. Don't like your job? Your ass is cold? Find another one, don't take it out on the customers tipping you=common sense.\nIf I didn't like those cheese sticks so much, I'd probably never come back. I'll most likely sit at the bar from now on, because the bartender's are usually a little nicer then the last 2 waitress we've had the displeasure of having."

That was the best part of being there, in my opinion. \n\nI didn't order a drink here, but it looked like they served everything in HUGE mason jars (how COUNTRY of them) - so I'd say if you love everything country, you'll probably love this bar & grill even if I didn't. ;)"

Of the sides with dinner, the mashed potatoes were good, very good. The rest of the sides which were the macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and potato salad we're just not tasty in anyway, and only a bite or two were taken from each serving. The place was cold and dark (it was tough to read the menu and we had to use the flashlight on our phones to be able to read), service was decent I guess, and our order was screwed up. Just not a good experience and certainly will not be back."

Buying less expensive entree would probably be a better call to reduce the ripped off sensation that really adds to the insult.  Beware of being offered a \"double\" when ordering drinks. Not only is the price double, but they then add another \"double fee\" on top of that. The drink costs more than a rib eye dinner!  Pretty clever.

You only need two or three to get a solid buzz going on. And let me give you a fair warning for you timid types. If it's someones birthday they will be in for a surprise if they don't know what to expect. First a bar tender will stand up and blow a whistle violently then present a drink with whip cream in the shape of a penis or a vagina for the appropriate sex. They will then hold it down by their groin while you chug the whole thing. I have seen multiple people get scared and embarrassed but hey guess what? it's VEGAS! So chug away! the bartenders are the showman type throwing bottles behind their backs and making a hell of a show out of your order.

They were quick and everything came out right.  The fried mac & cheese comes out in an amazing beer batter - these were the best I've ever had.  The bbq burger I had was massive and cooked just right.  They have some of the best french fries.  The guest I was with had the chili burger without the bread - good thing there was no way you could pick that up and eat it!  2 burgers,  2 regular drinks and an app for just over $30 not bad at all!\n\nThe second trip - it was later in the night and they weren't crazy busy but we waited over 20 minutes even though there were some open tables.  Then we waited quite some time for our waitress.  We gave our order and waited - the mac & cheese was just as good.  The burgers however were bad... I asked for mine medium well (should have been just past pink) - it was like a hockey puck.  My guest asked for hers medium and got one just past medium well.  We couldn't catch our waitress for over 10 minutes after our meals came out at which point there was no way we were waiting for them recook them.  They did make this right and take one of them off our bill... but at this point the dinner was ruined.\n\nThey do take off $1-$2 off each item if you have a total rewards card.  This place is extremely loud at night due to the live music and dancing - it is a bar after all so don't expect less.

The chicken was a quarter of the way out of the bun. \n\n  Dessert - none\n\nService - No pager system, really! The hostess took our name and asked how many people, 4 clearly as they had no others near the hostess stand.  They finally paged us over the speaker system, Paul party of two.  I went up and talked to a guy, I said I am Paul but a party of 4.  He said \"I was just testing you\", really that tells me you can not take the right number down.  They seated us immediately telling me that they are not managing their tables correctly.  Our waitress was good but had to ask for our player cards back, they should been in the bill folder or given back when associated with the bill.\n\nFuture - Maybe if they have a good house band."

Given the scenario, I honestly didn't expect her to come by and check up on us, but she did. And she was so attentive despite what 20% of $25 is (don't worry, she got waaay more than 20% of the tab).\n\nI'd give this place 5 stars if they didn't charge so much for mediocre food. $14 for an OK tasting burger? Cmon now. I can slap together the same burger @ home for $12.50 cheaper!"

There are a number of televisions, showing either sports or Toby Keith in concert.  Waitresses are uniformly thin, wear tight leather mini-skirts and short white tops, call everyone \"hon\" and are terminally cheerful.\n\nThe food is OK.  The fried bologna sandwich consists of a thick slab of pretty good bologna, lightly fried, with caramelized onions, American cheese, lettuce, and tomato, on Texas garlic bread.  If you like greasy food (like me), it's not bad; if you have a low grease tolerance, stay away!  For dessert, the sweet potato pecan pie with bourbon ice cream was a disappointment.  The combination of the two kinds of pie sounds like a good idea, but neither of the fillings was especially good.  On the other hand, the ice cream was very rich, a big plus.  Cola was served in a large mason jar.  I'm glad I went once, but don't plan to return."

You have to make your way through Harrah's all the way to the back, up the escalator and then there it is.\n\nSo for some reason I have been here a few times, and each time I really thought the food was less than desirable. This time was a little different. \n\nThe food is quite pricey for what it is. Yeah, you get a dollar off if you use your Total Rewards card, but really - it's still kind of expensive for just ok food. I got the chicken wrap last time and it was utterly inedible. I definitely won't get that ever again. Lots of wrap, not a lot of chicken.\n\nThis time, we ordered the fried macaroni and cheese and the brisket nachos. Let me say, I was pleasantly surprised. The mac and cheese balls were lightly battered and fried just crispy enough. The nachos - were heaping and the brisket was very good. good choices this time.\n\nNext - the beer - so there isn't a great selection of draft beer - but the bonus is how large a draft beer is. I believe they are 22oz for $10. Which isn't bad. And of course you can take it to go in a plastic cup. (But don't try and bring your outside drink into TK's)\n\nIf you're with a lot of friends, a beer tower is definitely the way to go... \n\nMinuses - the whole bar area didn't have a server. So all the tables in the bar area hadn't been bussed and it was a total mess. It's not really a problem to order the food through the bar,  but just means getting up and down if you need other things. The bartender was friendly and helpful, but then you wonder what you're tipping for when you are getting up and down... but oh well."

However, I was super dissapointed when I came to Vegas 2 weeks ago--7/27/13. I didn't want to make a review without speaking to the manager on duty about the situation (hoping something would be done about it. It wasn't.)\n\nMy party of 3 came here on Saturday night around 10 o'clock to eat. We were promptly told our wait was going to be around 10-15 minutes. Around the 20 minutes wait mark we noticed some tables available yet we weren't seated. I went up to the hostess and she said that they were waiting for tables to be bussed and clean. I dont get it. I could see in plain view 2 tables available. an extra 5 minutes passed and we were finally seated. At this point I was just glad to be at a table and I quickly got over the prior hiccup. My cousin and I decided to order our drinks and food as soon as our waitress came by (2 waters and a lemonade. Nothing difficult. Plus 2 bbq salads. No brainer.) My other cousin had run to the bathroom and we told her she could put in the orders in right way. No need to wait.\n\nKelly, greeted us and took our order. 20 minutes passed and we didn't even get our drinks. This particular night at TK's was steady NOT busy. Not a moment after she took our order my other cousin reappeared and we told him our situation. He was quite surprised that we hadn't received our drinks yet (he works at a resturant and informed us that there shouldn't be any reason why it should take that long. 7 minutes at the very least to get our drinks and a total of 20 minutes to get our meals.) We finally got our order after 15 minutes. So, we waited 35 minutes total for 2 salads. :-/\n\nAt this point I was quite upset at the service that was given to us. I managed to track down one of the girls (our waitress was MIA) and asked her to send the manager to our table. The manager emerged from a back room which I could only assume was a banquent/party room. I told him our situation and he seemed to understand me or, so I thought. He told us he was going to get our waitress and NEVER came to our table to check up on us. Wow, the longer we stayed the more I hated being there. We didn't feel like we were taken care of at all. \n\nKelly managed to shortly appear after we talked to the manager and told us that she had a mix up with a drink order with a larger party. It isn't difficult to take a drink order. You go around the table from person to person. She didn't apologize for the wait. Maybe because she assumed the problem wasn't her fault???!?! Nevertheless, we asked for our check so we wouldn't have to wait for it later. We honestly couldnt wait to get out of there to at which we decided to give our business to Gilley's at Treasure Island. \n\nSIDENOTE: We weren't expecting TK's to comp a meal if the manager and or Kelly took better care of us. We would have been fine paying for what we ordered. However, I won't be dining here next time I'm in town. \n\n-----\n\nI do however give credit where credit is due and we were at TK's the night before this night and we had a good time, AT THE BAR. The boys were great and we got our drinks in a timely manner. It may not have been as steady as Saturday but even with the visits we had here prior I have always had a good time at the BAR. So, do yourselves a favor if you dine here. Sit at the bar and order from the bartenders! They seem like they know what they're doing!"

I like that it's just off the parking garage so we don't have to push and shove our way through a crowded smoky casino to get there.  \n\nThe first time we went I ordered a steak, but what they don't tell you on the menu is that it comes smothered in mushrooms.  I'm deathly allergic and had to send it back to have it re-done.  It would have been nice to know ahead of time.  However, the waitress let me keep my sides so at least I got to eat some of my meal with my party.  \n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is the mac and cheese, and my husband has a sweet tooth for the deep fried twinkies.  I've ordered something different every time I've gone and other than the death steak it has all been really good.  When they have been busy, we have even recieved a free appetizer.\n\nI've read some people bitching that they got a plastic cup instead of the advertised mason jar.  Big deal, the place sells the mason jars and they do get busy.  God forbid they sell drinks faster than the dishwasher can do dishes.  Over all this is a fun place to eat that has good food and fair service, but I would not recomend it if you hate country music."

To my surprise they were quite good! They even did a cool blend (I'm a real DJ so I don't call things \"mashups\" like pop society, and am kind of mad at Glee for starting the wrong use of this term) of margaritaville to sweet child of mine back to margaritaville again that actually worked well. \n\nWe actually stayed about an hour longer than we planned because the music was good. \n\nThe decor is outstanding.

For instance the burgers come with a side order and one of the options is \"freedom fries\". Haha. 'Murica! \n\nNo matter how clich\u00e9 it is, I have to say it... I love this bar!"

The menu is really large and has many heavy fattening choices.\n\nWent with a group of 4 and ordered:\n\nApp: Full size beef nachos-- This was actually good and we finished it\n\nEntrees: Fried Bologna Sandwich, Ruben Sandwich, and half of a BBQ Chicken.\n\nThe Ruben Sandwich had to be sent back right away. It was had more bread than meat. The meat and coleslaw was totally flavorless. The bread was huge Texas Toast that was soaked in butter. This was replaced with a bowl of Tortilla Soup that was edible but still lacking  flavor.\n\nThe Fried Bologna Sandwich was pretty much the same as the Ruben. All butter soaked Texas Toast and a slab of fried bologna with no flavor. We did not send this back, but only half was eaten.\n\nNow on tho the BBQ Chicken plate. Can we say RAW chicken? When the BF ripped into this it was dripping blood. There were some small pieces that were cooked but for the most part it was raw and bloody. They tried to say it was because they smoked their chicken. Listen, I know the difference between smoked chicken ( which is pink) and bloody raw chicken. Totally disgusting and not worth going back. The BF was sick all night and serving raw chicken is dangerous!"

But I do know that country-western people know how to eat, so I was all up for visiting this bar/grill while we visited Vegas. \n\nIt's inside Harrahs on the strip. \nIt didn't open until 11 which was a bit annoying, considering how hungry I was at 10 am, but eventually it did. Like many chains, there is a feeling of \"same old same old\" the moment you walk in, just like any Jimmy Buffet Margaritavilles or a Applebees. \n\nThere was lot of country music and videos on the TV, mostly Toby Keith, and there are bra's hanging around the bar. A country western bar for sure! There is a stage for live music. The cool thing to do is order your beer in a giant mason jar (just Coors for the mason jar only). I hate Coors but I figured when in Rome....\n\nThe next day we popped by once again so she could get some souvenirs from the gift shop and pose with the cut-out photo of Toby. We did order up some chili fries and they were delicious which confirms my theory that the food here must be pretty good, in a chain kind of way. Hot and fresh and plentiful. Overall it lacks an original feeling. But I do plan to hit one up in Phoenix next time, so it did its job, but I'll avoid the Coors. Yuck."

Waited another 30 minutes at table before waitress told us it was self serve at the bar.  Waited another 15 minutes to order beer from bartender.  Friends and I looked at each other and said it has almost been an hour, and no food, no beer, time to leave.  By the way this was at 3:00 pm in the afternoon.  I will not be going back to Toby Ketih's bar anytime soon."

As expected, there were tons of folks in cowboy attire, lots of beer being gulped down, and drinks sipped out of mason jars.  They had a live band that was decent, go go dancers, and they'd occasionally blow a whistle and pour free shots into people's mouth.\n\nWhat' was the problem then?\n-- When the band was off stage they didn't play country music.  I want to hear Toby and George and Garth.  I didn't come here to hear hip hop.\n-- As a theme bar/restaurant, I wasn't expecting to see little Asian guys at the bar.  I'm no racist (by saying that I probably am racist despite being an Asian/Pacific Islander), but I want to see a southern belle or a redneck guy pouring drinks at a country bar."

That said - my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our dinner here, and I think it was probably the best meal we had on our recent trip to Vegas, which is sort of sad.    \n\nWe went for the fun atmosphere (there is Toby memorabilia everywhere and they play country music videos non-stop, which are about 2/3rds Toby Keith ones), but we were surprised that we actually really enjoyed the food!  We split the chicken fried steak ($16) and had more than enough for 2.  We were planning to order a dessert as well, but ended up being too full.  The steak itself was very tasty, and was served with gravy and excellent mashed potatoes.  The mac and cheese we chose as our side was more mediocre, but it also came with some cornbread, and some bread with sweet honey butter, which was really delicious.  \n\nService was friendly, if a little confusing (she failed to bring us the cornbread at first, and when we asked for it, she said they didnt have any and that was why it hadn't come out, but then she brought some immediately).  \n\nDefinitely one of the better options on the strip for moderately priced, tasty food, and I highly recommend, especially if you're a country fan."

It was so slippery that the slice of bologna inside one sandwich half slid right out when I tried to raise it to my lips, flew in the air, and skidded to a stop on the floor at my feet.  My waitress graciously got the chef to provide a quick replacement half at no additional charge, along with another long pickle spear.\n\nSpeaking of pickles, greasy and juicy battered Fried Pickles were a great appetizer dipped in refreshing pink Ranch Dressing.  Red, white and blue tortilla chips with a tasty mild salsa were good but cold.  Regardless of color, the chips tasted the same.  Visible egg and crunchy celery enhanced a side of potato salad which had a pleasurable tang.  \n\nA half-pound \"American Soldier\" Burger with Cheddar Cheese with Freedom Fries was made perfectly medium rare as ordered.  And a warm Southern Fried Twinkie, accompanied by whole strawberry pieces and sweet whipped cream, was a toothsome treat--much better than an unfried Twinkie.  Service by our scantily clad cowgirl was excellent, and all beverages were served in unconventional mason jar-like containers.\n\nThis time 4-1/2 stars overall!"

The food was very slow to arrive, as well. \n\nThe Cajun Shrimp appetizer was decent -- a large portion, served hot, with a tasty dipping sauce. I believe the menu description is inaccurate in that the shrimp itself is not spiced at all. Not to say it's bad, just not what I was expecting.\n\nThe veggie wrap -- admittedly, not what most patrons are going to order in the land of excess that is Las Vegas -- was awful. The filling was about 95% shredded lettuce, with a few other bits of stuff thrown in for color, and a dressing that was not so much bland as just yucky. I considered sending it back, but it was nearly the only thing on the menu that didn't used to have hooves. By which I mean, I didn't have a lot of vegetarian-ish choices.\n\nThe service was slow throughout the meal, and the waitress had a habit of timing her drive-bys when I had a mouthful of food and couldn't say anything. As fast as she was moving, you'd think she'd make it back around more frequently, but no. Don't let your drink glasses get empty, as you'll be sitting there thirsty for a while.\n\nAll that said, the setting is lively, especially later at night when there's a band on stage. I'm not a fan of country or western, but I'd watch just about any good band live. \n\nIf you're just going for a quick meal, you're better off elsewhere (e.g. next door at Imperial Palace there's a decent homestyle mexican place)."

Some of the negative reviews are definitely misleading. It's more of a sport bar during the day, so NO; they are not always going to be playing music. The food is good but nothing special either; but no one should go to sports bars or dance clubs for their food only, so why should TKB be rated just based on their food experience.\nOverall it's a very cool kickback place, in particular at the night time when the live music is going. We never have experienced any kind of drama and always end up meeting some very cool people there. I minus a star for their pricy food and the fact that not all bands are always that good. Maybe good as musicians, but some are not 100% country bands. Obviously you expect a kick ass COUNTRY band every time you hit the TKB, but sometimes you'll get that Rock/Pop/Country band that not everyone likes."

We got in without reservations with only a minimal wait at 6:00 on a weeknight in July.  It was a little tricky to find as it was upstairs and around a corner inside of a casino (Harrah's Las Vegas), but after wandering around for a while we finally figured it out.  \n\nThe decor is very cutesy country, fitting since the bar's namesake, Toby Keith, is a famous country singer.  The atmosphere alone is worth part of the cost of the meal.  We pushed together a couple of tables and ordered a few drinks.  Now, I should probably warn you, as I WISH someone had warned me, that their drinks are HUGE and come in large mason jars.  Even the adult beverages come in these same jars, and they don't make them weak an watered down, either.  You'll be feeling your liquor by the end of your first one, and I had more than one.  I was drinking one of their signature cocktails called The Patriot. The Patriot consists of Jim Beam Kentucky Bourbon, Southern Comfort, dry vermouth, and sour mix with just a splash of sierra mist on top.   Let me tell you, they go down smooth.  I had a sip of my friend's Georgia Peach (vodka, peach schnapps, and sierra mist, and it wasn't too shabby either.\n\nWhen it came time to order the entree I decided to go with the BBQ'D rotisserie chicken as it looked like one of the healthiest items on the menu.  For about $18 I got a half chicken slow cooked on a rotisserie to a tender and moist perfection and brushed with a generous helping of barbecue sauce.  It came with a choice of two sides; I chose mixed vegetables and a baked potato.  I asked them to put just cheese and bacon on the potato and put the butter and sour cream on the side. Everything was tasty and while I felt stuffed by the end of the meal, at least I didn't feel like I'd clogged my arteries with grease.  One of my friends even mentioned how tasty my plate looked.\n\nI'd definitely come back again the next time I'm in Vegas"

A good chicken or BBQ should stand on its own without sauce to hide the quick-fix process.  The green beans were shriveled and the potatoes, while flavorful, we're just scooped from a big mound somewhere.  Could have been better, but could have been worse.  Maybe I'll try a burger next time, but appreciate the restaurant for what it is...a big name joint on the strip in Vegas."

I really enjoy Toby Keith's music and I like the atmosphere with the pretty ladies in their backless chaps but we didn't even end up with a hot waitress and the music was so loud that was playing I couldn't even complain to our waitress if I wanted to but I just couldn't even stomach the energy after how bad everything was. I will hopefully be uploading some photos to cement the fact you shouldn't bother with this place but it's me and I am not always that good at attention to detail. This would have to be one of the first places I have not been able to finish my food though. I am the queen of eating pretty much anything but this place failed hardcore. The chips and Queso was definitely from a Can but that at least tasted good just wasn't worth the $... Definitely try somewhere else if you have the chance!"

The drinks and variety of beers is very good. Every time we go to the restaurant we try something new, like the delicious chicken spicy wings, or the Fried Bologna sandwich, or the Fried Twinkies for dessert.. This visit we tried the Meat Loaf with Gravy, Baked Beans and a Baked Potato with Bacon. It was Awesome, it made me feel like I was back home ! My wife had the Country Fried Chicken Steak with Gravy, with saluted vegetables and mashed potatoes, which she said was also very yummy ! They always have great music playing in the restaurant and have live entertainment at times. They also have a wide variety of Toby Kieth memorabilia to see and enjoy also. Give it try on your next visit to Las Vegas, and bring your \"Red Solo Cup\".\n\n  \nVisited November 2014"

Our group ended up being split over two large tables of about 12ppl and one small table of 4. Not close enough for conversations between the groups. \n\nThe food was fine. Nothing amazing but not inedible. Most people had a burger, I got a chicken fried steak. Why I have no idea. It was good enough I guess. \n\nThe drinks were GOOD. Pretty much what got this to 3 stars. Granted it was $20 for one drink, but the one drink was in a 32 oz mason jar and had something like 5 shots in it.\n\nOur waitress was great. She was nice and as quick as could be for a large party.\n\nOver all I wouldn't head back but mostly just because I wouldn't have gone their in the first place if I had a choice."

Their 32oz (yes, 32oz!) mason jar drinks are an incredible deal and STIFF but still taste amazing! I am not a light weight by any means when it comes to drinking but after 1 1/2 of those drinks and a bar sweat shot I was done for.

The bartenders were fun and charismatic and made killer drinks. \n\nOnly downside is the fact that the location is horrible.

Not loud but not quiet at all.  Seats are widely spaced apart so your not sharing food with your neighbor.  \n\nStarted with the fried mac and cheese balls.  $10 for 4 balls.  They were lightly beer battered and not too greasy.  Came quickly in about 7 minutes after ordering the app and our dinner. Absolutely delicious.  I almost wanted to cancel the dinner and order some more. Recommended. \n\nNext came dinner.  I got the pulled pork sandwich with fries. Good but not over the top.  I was in the mood for good so it worked for me. The waitress asked me if I was ok with the coleslaw.  I was , but glad she asked.   The coleslaw added a crisp bite to the chunky pork lathered in the slightly tangy sauce.  It was a nice medley to compliment the soft chewy bun. \n\nMy girlfriend got the old West cheeseburger and she says 10/10.   The bun was buttery and soft and the party cooked to perfection. (Well done).  Not my choice of doneness but whatever works is what works.   We finished everything so that must mean we liked it.  \n\n\nOverall. 9/10.  Beer was cold.  Food was delicious. And the environment was country.  Just what we like.   Baseball and football games all over the place on about 20 televisions."

Let me explain.\nWhen your waitress takes your order, and you order appetizers, there is a good chance your main course will arrive with, or even before, your appetizer.  It's not the fault of the waitress, she always asks if we wanted the appetizer first, then the main course.  The problem is the process in which your food is delivered to your table.  Your waitress doesn't deliver, your food is delivered by other staff.  I'm quite sure the waitress and the cooks are on the same page, but the food delivery people don't seem to be in on the communication chain.  \nAll that said, just order appetizers first, and order your main dish AFTER you receive your appetizer or when you're ready.  \nGreat tip: Wednesday is .25 cent wing night, and Thursday is $6 steak night.  Great value!"

I liked how they put your food on a cutting board if you're sitting at the bar. The portions weren't as big as I thought they would be given the prices they charged.

The last two times I have come however it has been the complete opposite. The only reason it was so horrible the last two times was because of the bartenders. The first time I went we had a guy bartender who was giving attitude to every guy around us for no reason and only paid attention to hot girls who flirted with him. I would sit there forever waiting for a drink and when he finally got to me he got my order wrong and when I told him he told me I didn't tell him that drink and he made a big seen throwing my drink in the trash and giving me a dirty look. Later on in the night I saw him be rude to many polite customers and even kiss a few female customers which disgusted me since he had a wedding ring on. \n\nWe came back the next time we were in Vegas hoping he wouldn't be there which he wasn't, thank God! Yet we ended up with the same problem. The bar was practically empty yet me and my husband waited fifteen minutes for a drink because the bartender was to busy flirting with two girls sitting at the bar. Every time this one girl took a sip of her drink he would pour a little more wine in. Then when he finally got to us all I asked for was a malibu and coke and he somehow screwed it up and I couldn't get his attention again to tell him so I had to go to another section of the bar to tell another bartender.\n\nSorry I know I am rambling on but I have been to a lot of bars in my life and have never been so angry by the service of a bartender. I use to love this place but I highly doubt I will ever go back because the bartenders care more about getting girls than keeping customers happy."

I'd rather get my beer than watch the bar tenders kill time spinning and throwing liquor bottles, but that's just me.  Stop in for a drink I suppose, if you want to pay that much for drinks ($7 for a miller lite).  We did enjoy the band and we like how active duty military personnel are treated, we did see a marine who just got married.  Other than those upsides, this place is not a hit."

            "review": "It is actually closer to a 4 1/2 review but really good bar type food. We ate there twice over the weekend. The first time the food was delivered to the Pool area and my wife and kids ate it while sitting poolside. They got Chicken Strips and Fry's and they split it with 5 people. The batter on the Chicken was light and yet still crunchy and the fry's were great and plenty of them. \n\nWe went back for dinner before heading to the Airport on Sunday evening after a long weekend. Once again the food was fresh and plentiful and the place was packed. I would go to another the next time I see this chain."

            "review": "Toby Keith I do NOT love your bar. The food was ok. But the staff was RUDE!!! my goodness! Unfriendly! It was our first time there. My husband & I were meeting our family there. We were the first to arrive. After standing in the front for over 5 min. I walk to a podium off to the side & ask if we seat ourselves or is there a host? I was rudely informed by a crabby phillipino lady that she WAS the host. And we could not be seated until our entire party arrived. So we waited. When we all got there & got seated...we waited some more. The whole experience was way overpriced. Thumbs down Toby Keith.....get a new staff."

            "review": "Ok food- not bad but not great. Service was slow. There were many empty seats and yet they said the wait time was 20 minutes, so we sat at the bar. We ate our dinner at the bar. We wanted dessert but since the food took almost a half hour to come out, we asked the bartender for a Pecan Pie to go while we were eating so that we wouldn't miss the show. We get the bill and the bartender tacked on a \"to go\" charge for the Pecan Pie. Now, don't get me wrong- I'm from NY and used to charges like plate sharing etc where usually the waiter informs us that we should order something small instead of being charged the $5 or $6 sharing fee. But we sat and ate our dinner and now you are charging\nme a \"to go\" fee that is half the cost of the food item I ordered. Hmm. Just doesn't make sense. If I order the pie and then just asked for a box, it wouldn't have been more...so why not just suggest that? I asked the bartender about the fee and he said he couldn't take it off because we asked for it \"to go\" even though we sat there. It wasn't the fee that bothered me so much, it was the principle. And just like you are there to make money, I'm there to spend money- but not on a restaurant that charges me to put my pie in a box after I ate at their establishment. I'm a former waiter and restaurant manager btw- so things like this tick me off."

            "review": "Let me say this first;  the food is ok, typical bar food.  The prices are a little high but it is Vegas you have to expect that.  Now let me say this;  We went there two times during our most recent trip to Vegas, and both times we ran into problems with the staff.  The first trip we were a party of four.  There were several empty tables but we were told it was a 20 minute wait.  I said \"really?  But there are many empty tables\": to which the hostess replied quite nastily: \"that's right\" and then walked away without taking our name for the list.  As we were ready to walk out she came back, took our names and 15 minutes later we were seated.  We waited 10 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 for her to take our dinner order.  The food was ok, not great not bad.  Now, three days later I went down to get a bowl a soup because I was not feeling well.  I was seated right away, but again waited 10 minutes for a waitress; let me say there were only two other people in the restaurant.  The big problem with Mr. Keith's restaurant is he need to hire nicer, more professional, and more efficient staff.  Do try the chicken and dumpling soup though;  it was very Grandma's home made soup."
