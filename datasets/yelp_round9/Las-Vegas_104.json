            "review": "The food was good but the service wasn't. I had their version of eggs Benedict. I wasn't a huge fan of their Parmesan cream sauce seeing as a good hollandaise is impossible to replace. They filled my cup with some mildly warm coffee when I got there and I finished that and my water 10 mins before my food came. When my food came it was like a drop and run. I never even had a chance to ask for more coffee or water. If you want a 5 dollar cup of cold coffee and NO service this is a place to check out. The food isn't bad tho. They weren't busy at all so I don't sympathize for the lack of service. I wouldn't go back."

The biggest thing I noticed is when he came by to take our order, he would notice that we were talking and he would make a round to come back again.  He didn't want to disrupt the conversation.  It was so polite!!\nThe food was also great.  Between the four of us, not one of us had a complaint.  I would for sure go again and I would tell others to go as well.  \nOh and the atmosphere is super fun too :)"

Ok, we're flexible. We ordered the porterhouse steak, filet mignon, duck and wide pasta and the fettuccine with shrimp dishes. We were all extremely disappointed as none had any flavor. When our server came by and offered pepper, we eagerly accepted. \nWe all walked in expecting a great NYE dinner and it was an epic failure. One bad meal...whatever. But, four? Worst meal ever! Truly no flavor to review.\nOnly reason it deserves a star is because our server was attentive."

I've been to the Il Fornaio in San Diego (Coronado) and that place is amazing. \nAnyways, the one at Las Vegas has a different menu (which is fine) with a very minimal selection. I felt like everything was just Pasta and Pizza. The bread was cold. We asked for warm fresh bread and the waiter says \"that's how it is here. we only bake it twice a day\"- this response made me laugh in ridiculousness. Ordered Parmigiana and Pasta Mare which were just ok. Not enough seasoning and both were very bland. I am a huge fan of Il Fornaio in SD, but man this place really needs to step it up."

I had one of the chef specials, which was amazing, and my husband had the linguini mari-- he loved it.  Also, the bread to start was quite good and the olive oil was lovely.  I took off a star for service-- we had some time, so it was okay, but I was getting antsy to go do other things besides dinner before our show."

The layout of the restaurant contributes to the slower service; we weren't in a hurry so it was OK.  I think they were understaffed today because of the holiday. I'd go back!"

            "review": "I was in town in January for the Consumers Electronic Show.  After walking the show and the strip for two days, fighting crowds, illegals aggressively pushing handouts for call girls, & disorientating casinos I was in the mood to have a relaxing sit down meal.  Unfortunately I found myself plodding with my partners in crime through the kitschy and less than memorable New York New York.  Desperate for sustenance we somehow stumbled upon this oasis in the sea of madness.  \n\nPrice for Vegas, more than reasonable.  Atmosphere, inside was sublime, a break away from the noise and flash of the casino.  Bread delivered with a high quality olive oil for dipping. Impeccable service.  The sight and smells of chickens roasting and spinning over a wood fired oven.  My Linguine Mare Chiaro (Thin flat pasta with clams, mussels, prawns and scallops; seasoned with tomatoes, crushed red pepper, garlic and trebbiano wine for $24) more than filling and compelling.  ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/3rd-coast/4411067724/sizes/o/ )\n\nIs it the best Italian restaurant you will find in Vegas?  Probably not.  But it is the best food for accessible prices you are bound to find.  It is all about your preconceived notions; I expected too little and was shown how much a casino based restaurant can deliver.  For all the bitching about Vegas food and the restaurant prices, this is an oasis in a sea of mediocrity."

Two teenagers each had a pasta dish with sauces that were quite good.  Both were fine, and portions were on the small side.  The bread was excellent.  As a bakery, their abilities are quite good.  Olive oil was fresh as well.  The salmon was a bit over cooked.  It was not what I would consider uber fresh, just okay.  I would expect it to be a bit more fresh.\n\nThe toddler's pizza was 20 bucks.  I guess since we removed the cheese it became a \"specialty pizza\".  The service was suited to a 15% tip but not more.  The price was over 100 bucks with no alcohol, no drinks.  I would think a better value can be found elsewhere.  Nothing bad here, but would I go back for just a so so meal when others excel? Nope.  Overall, ... meh..."

            "review": "I wasnt pumped about having a dress up night on Our trip to Vegas, but thats what the girls wanted an in order to get laid that night, I agreed. So we end up eating here because it's the only place that had food chicks eat. I opted for the spaghetti with meat sauce and angel hair. It was a chili type which surprised me, but it was absolutely delicious. The price was $40 for 2 people which I think is way under-priced. My wife is super picky, almost to the point of obnoxious, and she was raving about it. I wish I hadnt washed my hands, while I was up the bread came and the rest of the party ate most of it. It was delicious and I only ate it plain. You dont need to be dressed up to eat here, I seen people who look like they just came from the County fair and they got the same great service. If I had to absolutely nit pick this place, and find something wrong I'd say the cigarette smoke from the casino if you're sitting on the \"outside\" of the restaurant. It's not literally outside, its just the way its built its not in the main part. And it wasnt even bad. I recommend this place entirely. We followed it up with a show across the street called Ka. It's my next review."

We were not looking for fancy we just wanted to eat dinner. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli. My husband had a personal pizza margarita. I go to cut the first ravioli and put the slice on my fork when under that slice is a black hair. My husband said hell no I'm not paying for hair. So we sent it back. Then I sat and sat and sat and my husband stopped eating. The guy comes over and goes how is everything. I look at him and say I don't know you tell me. At least 30 minutes went by. He suddenly had this look of shock like \"Oh, crap I totally forgot her order.\" I said I'm not paying for any of this meal and we walked out. I hate them. I wont even eat at the one near me because I'm so pissed from this experience."

I mean I cannot pronounce it for you, all I could remember is that it had \"pollo\" in the title and by gosh chicken was in the dish! \n\nThe chicken was no dry or overcooked, but so tender and with the sauce to dip it in, even better. The noodles I had were also perfect, but whatever the sauce was, it was fantastic! I know that it had some type of wine mixed into it, which of course wine and me always bond well, but it truly was something I never tasted before. \n\nThis place is pricey for sure, I mean just my pasta was $18 bucks, but hey, so worth it! The service was great too. The little old man who waited on us was so adorable and he suggested the right wines with what we order and just made sure to really understand what we wanted because he was Italian himself and had that strong accent, but no problems really came about in the communication department! Woo hoo! \n\nOverall, I loved the place. Had my eye on it every time I walked into New York New York and was happy when a family member decided to treat me to it! Gotta love family! :)"

            "review": "I am kind of on the fence about how many stars to give this place, but the customer service by our waiter, Jefferson, takes it to the above average review.  \n\nThey take reservations which is nice.  We had tickets to a show and I was concerned about the logistics of navigating Vegas on a Friday night.  \n\nThe restaurant is bright and airy and pleasing enough.  you are served a verity of bread along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The bread was cold which surprised me, most Italian restaurants I've been to warm the bread.  There was one particular roll in the basket that we really liked and were brought a basket of just those.  \n\nI ordered the spaghetti balognese  which was good but really nothing to write home about.  My wife ordered chicken parmigiana which is an off the menu item.  Despite that, it was served quickly and was VERY good.  \n\nThey had a pretty good wine list and while some of their selections are quite over priced by bottle, we found one that we were familiar with which I actually thought was even a bit under priced considering.   \n\nWhile we enjoyed our experience here, it is overall entirely too expensive.  Believe it or not, it was actually the bottle if wine that I thought was reasonably priced.  \n\nThere is another place in the casino called Nine Fine Irishmen.  While it is also too expensive, the overall experience is enough to make me overlook the cost (to a certain extent).  Il Fornaio just does not offer the same benefit.  Had it not been for the excellent service that we received from our waiter Jefferson, I would only give this place a begrudging 3 stars."

The value incredible.  We had the prefix because we wanted to eat reasonable.  This is Italian comfort food at its best.   Appetizer was flat bread. It was good but large.  More like a pizza but if you are hungry who am I to complain.  Second was penne alla vodka.  Very nice and taste.  The desserts were the highlights.  Tiramisu was as good as any restaurants in Manhattan.  Very light and taste.  Chocolate mouse cake with fresh raspberries.  So so so good.  Fresh raspberries need I say more with chocolate."

I really enjoyed the bread, and the waiters were good about refilling our bread about 5 times throughout the meal. One of my friends ordered the pizza, which to me was on the smaller side. One got the lasagna which was a personally piece cooked in a small bowl by itself. Another friend got some chicken dish and I had the Ravioli alla Lucana which was fresh organic spinach ravioli filled with Italian sausage, ricotta, parmesan and fennel; fresh tomatoes, spicy tomato sauce with imported peperoncino, pecorino pepato cheese and fresh basil*\n*Courtesy of their website. lol\nI remember really enjoying my dinner. I think the portions were a little on the smaller side but then again it is Vegas so it is expected. We sat outside in their little patio which was really nice and made me feel like I was Jersey Shoring in Italy. Fun times.\nThen the cabs were here so we had to bounce.\nCio, grazie."

Breakfast foods were not meant for eating buffet style, especially eggs! I recommend the Omelette Alla Contandina(red onion, bacon, potatoes) with a side of Polenta, garnished with Gorgonzola. The Omelette is stuffed full of goodness and the Polenta with Gorgonzola was a nice addition to the meal! I'm not that picky about my coffee, but I thought the coffee was great.

He said the only place he'd really recommend is Il Fornaio; otherwise, he advised us to take the walkway to MGM. Due to the weather, we opted for Il Fornaio. We got waters & the bread/olive oil- it took at least 20min to get the balsamic & straws to go with. The appetizer came out in decent time & was pretty scrumptious. It then seemed to take forever to get our entr\u00e9e orders in. When we got them, they were so scalding hot that we had to wait another 15min to dig in. Neither dish- at 18.99/ea.- was impressive. &, once again, our waiter was MIA. From finishing our food to the next time we saw him was another 15-20min so we were afraid to order dessert, since we were now cutting it close on time. Which we told him. Which he acknowledged so he got our bill in a much more timely manner. Then disappeared again! A good 15 more min went by before someone came to fetch our plastic to pay. Atmosphere: bland. Service: sucks. Food: lackluster. Seriously, just eat at Nathan's hotdogs upstairs."

Nothing too exciting and nothing to get worked up about.  I had the capellini with tomatoes, basil and marinara.  The pasta was a smidge too al dente.  The hot chocolate was not too chocolatey.  If my family didn't join me for dinner I would've been happier with a Nathan's dog."

Was seated immediately (around 9:00pm). \n\nWaiter warned that the bread basket would be addictive - but he was wrong. The olive bread tasted too much like olive - I guess I don't like olives. The sesame roll was kinda dry. Sourdough was OK - interior wasn't as soft and chewy as I was hoping. \n\nI ordered the promising sounding special - pesto penne pasta with sun-dried tomatoes and roasted pistachios. It was OK, but not amazingly so. For $16, I was hoping for something with more pesto flavor. \n\nSO had Cannelloni Con Pollo - Large pasta tubes filled with roasted chicken, swiss chard, ricotta, pecorino and parmesan cheese, onions and applewood-smoked bacon; baked in the wood-fired oven with bechamel and topped with sauteed champignon mushrooms and marinara sauce. Sounds fancy, doesn't it? Well, it's just thin sheets of pasta with stuff wrapped up in it. Like an egg roll, but steamed rather than fried. Maybe it was me, but I couldn't really taste all the swiss chard, pecorino, etc. I wouldn't order it again."

Which is very convenient if you're staying there, or on that end of the Strip.  But because it's in the middle of a casino, it's also very loud.  Half the seating is basically on the casino floor.  So you see every drunken idiot walking past you, playing the slots, etc.  Very loud too given that you can hear all the machines and music from other venues nearby.  The service and Il Fornaio was excellent once we were seated.  Started off with appetizers of calamari and bruschetta, which were both very good.  People also said the caesar and caprese salads were great.  I kept it simple and went with the angel hair pasta - which I thought was really solid.  They have a full bar and an extensive wine list.  Prices are extremely reasonable too - especially given its location.  Everyone in our group left happy and full."

It not only had not a hint of lamb flavor, but didn't taste like garlic. It was dry and rubbery as well. It was served with spinach that obviously was tossed in my plate right our of a can, and a very small handful of old fries. I sent this back and got what they called lasagna.

We took a peak into Chin Chin and it was surprising a Chinese place was serving a typical standard American Breakfast: muffins, waffles, etc.  So we decided to chance it goin to Il Fornaio even though there's one in our town.\n\nI got the corned beef hash with fried polenta and gorgonzola, and poached eggs.  Bf had simliar dish but it was a corned beef hash omelette.  Both were amazing.  The polenta was so rich but not as crispy as I've had it before but still great.  Corned beef was seasons beautifully and poached eggs done to perfection.  Coffee and Cafe Latte was pretty good as well.  Very satisfying and it was reasonably priced for a nice restaurant on the strip.  I think it was around 30 dollars for both our meals w/ drinks.

The service was prompt and attentive and the hostess accomodated our group without a reservation. A nice spot for a good meal without surprises."

I ordered the Insalata di Bietole the red and gold beets were a delicious earthy contrast to the peppery wild arugula and the toasted walnuts and asiago cheese added a creamy roundness to the dish. I ordered it without the dressing. I instead asked for olive oil to drizzle on top. The olive oil was fruity with lemony notes. It was simple but very delicious. Also, the wine list was excellent. Reasonably priced, and a nice selection. We were both very satisfied."

For some reason they really wanted to sit on the \"patio\" which is really just the area outside of the main restaurant right next to the slot machines.  As you can imagine that made for a really loud meal and the main thing that kept me from rating Il Fornaio any higher.\n\nWe were here on a Sunday night, and had to wait about 10-15 minutes to be seated.  Like any Italian place, you get plenty of bread with vinegar and oil to tide you over while you decide on what to have.  I went for the margherita pizza, which was more than I could handle.  If I recall correctly it was in the 10-15 dollar range.  Most of the other entrees are a bit more pricey.  The wait staff was friendly but a little too attentive for my taste.  I don't need to be asked every 4 minutes if I'm ok, or have someone reach through my conversation to refill my water that's not even half gone.\n\nIf I go back here, I'll definitely get inside seating.  The food is slightly above the Olive Garden.  I wouldn't absolutely rule this place out for a second visit, but it's far from your best option."

It just didn't taste fresh at all and I left with a stomach ache. The bread was also cold, which is an automatic fail for an Italian restaurant! Lastly, the management was all sitting together at the front of the restaurant just eating and talking, not very professional at all, and I expected more for the ratings, reviews, and the food. Take our advice, save your money and your stomach the agony!"

The server did not spend much time at the table and the restaurant was not busy, only a few tables.After we declined drinks (apparently its offensive to be sober in Vegas), his mood was rather sour. We ordered two lunch specials, a panini and a salmon dish. There was a bread basket with oil which was ok. No attention to refilling our waters. Instead of the panini, there was a steak presented, one that did not look too tasty. The food presentation in general was lacking. The salmon was very dry with very little flavor. It was tepid when served. The entire plate was drowned in oil. It did not taste like olive oil either, for the bread or the entrees, probably soybean oil cut with olive. It took very long for the panini to come out, we had already finished the salmon. There was no apology or offer extended to compensate for the service mistake. Even if it was no one's fault, server presence is the difference between a happy and annoyed customer. The panini was very dry and the beef tough. The server seemed impatient for us to leave, maybe he was having a stressful day. The menu was a lot more appealing than the actual restaurant and experience."

When we went inside and stumbled on Il Fornaio, we were grateful because we knew what to expect: we've eaten at their locations near our hometown. To our surprise, the restaurant was nearly empty at 12:30 pm. Our server was very friendly, although she reached out and patted my 5 year old son on the head, and I don't love it when people think touching someone else's kids is OK by default. Still, she meant well.\n\nMy wife got her usual, Insalata Di Bietole. That beet salad is very good and this visit was no exception. My son got a small-ish portion of plain penne, with marinara sauce on the side, so he was happy. I had minestrone soup and a caesar salad. Now, a few days later, I don't remember the taste or look of the food at all, which is about what I expect from Il Fornaio. The food is fine, nothing wrong with it, but nothing that you'll look back fondly upon later.\n\nIl Fornaio only merits three stars from me because it's not worth going out of your way for. Still, I'd come back when I'm hungry and it happens to be convenient."

This comes baked rye and sesame bread. Ask them if they can heat it up b/c mines was served cold. :/ Anyways, I suggest to choose the flatbread as your starter (it has fresh mozzarella and goat cheese along with tomatoes and olives which was real good). You may also choose their soup or salad. Soup is very small. My main course meal was the pasta with vodka sauce (red sauce and cream sauce). However, it was okay, the bacon in it was good but for the price I say order the salmon with veggies instead. The highlight of the three-course meal was the tiramisu! It is made in their restaurant, so it tastes fresh! If you like chocolate, their chocolate mouse is the bomb. \n\nThis is located inside of the New York New York hotel on the Vegas strip and when parked (love how most hotels have free self-parking) you go down the escalator from the arcade and it is on your right side near the casino."

I remember having a ridiculously delicious, rich pasta dish with seafood, and a decadent chocolate cake-thing for dessert. \n\nFast forward to this past month. Myself, my partner, and our best friend are roaming around before seeing a show at the casino, and I realize while I'm looking at this restaurant that it is the same restaurant my dad and I ate at years before. Remembering how much I loved it, we absolutely had to have dinner there before the show - even if the guys were skeptical.\n\nI should have listened to them.\n\nAlthough they were super nice and helpful (I'd hit my head pretty hard on the roller coaster, and they gave me water and let me just stand in the way at the entrance for about ten or fifteen minutes, nobody knowing if I'd pass out, before we finally decided to go in and eat there), and the fact that we were seated really quickly, I don't think I'd ever return to this place.\n\nThe prices are pretty high and the food is a bit mediocre. We ordered pizza because it's what the guys wanted, and although it wasn't bad, it was nothing to write home about. Since they're located in the New York, New York hotel/casino, we definitely expected a lot more from our pizza experience. Sad sad...\n\nOn top of the mediocre food disappointing me in comparison to my memories of how delicious things were before, the gentleman that we saw most often - a \"bus boy\", I think? - glared at us and made us feel as though we were children being GROUNDED. Every time he returned to the table, his demeanor and the way he moved things around (things were \"set\" down on the table very briskly and firmly, to say the least), he kind of barked at us, and was just overall unpleasant. Our waitress, however, was smiley and nice - all of the two times she made it back to our table.

Absolutely love their free bread and olive oil for dipping.  Old-world hard European crust with lovely soft center - I haven't found a better crusty bread anywhere since!  As for the rest of the food, frankly, I don't recall much so it must have been good, but not absolutely great.  But the bread - that's what I go back for!  3 stars."

It's located in NewYork NewYork Casino, it's very cool how they have it set up, we had the option to eat outside and we did. \nUnfortunately I forgot what I ordered but it was AMAZING! The food was good, I thought I wasn't going to get a lot for what I ordered (a $20) plate. But it was amazing, everything was seasoned perfectly too. I also had a really good alcoholic drink(about $12) which I thought was overpriced but that's how they have. The only negative is that and a small long wait."

We were actually in a bit of a hurry, and I did a Yelp search for close places in our hotel, and this came up.  As is often the case, once you filter out the outliers in the reviews, you actually come up with some helpful ones and it seems there are some who can appreciate what is actually pretty decent/authentic Italian food considering the venue.\n\nService was very friendly and fast on our visit, and while I agree this place lacks a little in atmosphere maybe, it is in a theme hotel so using that as a primary judgment seems short sighted.\n\nFood was good too, we had....\n\nUova Con Pancetta Affumicata\nOmelette Alla Contadina\n\nBoth were good, particularly the apple-wood smoked bacon in both dishes, and the filone toast that came with them was great too.  Good coffee as well which was well needed before our travels home for the day.\n\nPerspective people!  This is Las Vegas, it is not Italy (and no the Venetian does not count either - but it's a good hotel).  Good thing too, because those whining about slow service would probably find it even slower and annoying if they really did go to Italy, not all folks are in a super hurry all the time, I'm actually glad for times when I'm not as well!"

Here's my review:\n\n1. Environment: Entertaining. \n\nWe were seated in their indoor \"balcony.\" The balcony area was quaint and I love the lamp posts surrounding the area.  But most of all, the balcony gave as an amazing for people watching.  Because the balcony is located inside the casino, the people watching was varied and very entertaining.  \n\n2. Service: Sufficient.\n\nOur waiter as very friendly.  But because CES was in town this weekend, the restaurant was pretty busy and we hardly saw our waiter.  Thank goodness for the waters, or we would have been out of drinks during the middle of our dinner.  \n\nOur order was correct and the waiter was friendly.  \n\n3. Food: Meh.\n\nI had the Cannelloni al Forno.  Weirdly, parts of the dish were hot and parts of the dish were cold.  Too bad too.  The dish would have been promising if it didn't have that weird hot/cold thing going on.\n\nI'm not going to completely write off this place because I know how good this restaurant can be.  However, this location is not very high on my Restaurant list."

There was also a busser who never said a word and a runner who more or less rolled his eyes when food hit the table. Really not great.\n\nAnd the food isn't doing it any favors either.\n\nWe started with the calamari, which is Italian for salty octopus parts (or at least from my experience here, it must be). The tentacles are always my favorite and they were overly crispy to the point of being burned. There wasn't much redeeming about it.\n\nThen after the salty sea, we split the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were the tiniest meatballs I've ever seen, and in comparison the ikea meatballs were WAY more juicy and meaty. So I mean, like, it's do-able, I just don't get why this restaurant couldn't keep up. C'mon guys, step your game up. Our server could not care less about us and I could not think less of the food.

Slightly classy Italian with decent selection of appetisers and breads. The serving sizes were perfect and we didn't require ice cream or coffee afterward.\n\n***HOWEVER, there were a few issues we had with our dining experience. The primary issue was with service.

What they didn't mention was that we had to wait for the floor staff to finish laughing amongst themselves before nothing to seat us.\n\nOnce finally seated we looked through the menu, chose our meals and twiddled our thumbs and yawned a few times before the waiter came back (20 minutes later) with water and the free bread we were meant to receive on arrival...? He had forgotten to get the oil and vinegar for the breads so we ordered our food and waited for our oil.\n\n10 minutes later a lady who couldn't understand much english came along with the oil and poured it all over the place (yes, this was a language barrier issue - the oil was everywhere like a crime scene), and we spent a few moments giving the place a good wipe down in preparation for the meal.\n\nThe mains were actually quite timely once we disregard the other delays... Although I did spend a further 5 minutes figuring out where the restroom was in the casino (why the f*ck there wasn't one in the restaurant I will never know)..\n\nAs stated above the meals were fine......\n\nOnce we were finished we spent about 5 minutes staring into space yawning before we walked to the bar to ask for our bill. The bill eventually came along, it wasn't too bad.\n\nWould I go there again? No. Was the food great? Yes. Do they need to sort out their staff? Yes. Did we tip them? HELL NO."

We were sat immediately, but waited at least 10 minutes before we were acknowledged. The waiter  didn't acknowledge that we had been sitting for a while when he finally approached us to take our drink order. When he brought my coffee he didn't bring  sugar and we had to get our own sugar off of another table. Same with the food- the food was practically thrown on the table drive-by style and nobody checked on us at all after the food was dropped, until they dropped off the bill. The mascarpone french toast was tasty but luke warm. My girlfriend ordered the Contadina omelette, specifically for the gorgonzola cheese (which didnt end up making its way into her omelette). She also had to get hot sauce and ketchup from another table."

We made reservations ahead of time which was a good idea as there was a bit of a wait when we arrived for our seating time and having a reservation meant that we got seated fairly promptly.\nI had the pennoni all vodka which was amazing and he had the ravioli alla lucana which I tried some of and it was also pretty good.\nWe had been given a coupon for a free dessert when we made our reservation so we had the Rosina al Cicolatto which was very rich and decadent.\nService was very professional and prompt. Only complaint was our server was difficult to find at the end of our meal when we were trying to settle the bill. He had accidentally brought us another tables bill. Other than that no complaints and will definitely return again in the future!"

Gary checked in on us a ton of times! he even walked by a few times to teach my kids some Italian words.  He was really nice, the food was just \"okay\"   I would return and try a different dish another time.  The pasta Fagioli Soup was good, the kids had a Margharetta pizza which was good, I had one slice of theirs.  We ordered the brushetta appetizer, I would skip this, we asked for only the tomato brushetta and no goat cheese or the other one on there.... which they did give us but it was not very flavorful.  It had too much pesto on top and underneath and the tomatoes had no taste.   \n\nI think the place has good food but not great food.  I used to live in NY and you definitely cannot compare it to a \"NY\" restaurant like Umbertos NY or anyplace like that but it was a good meal.  Also, soda and lemonade refills are not free, so be careful with that, my daughter got another lemonade and didnt even finish it and I was charged for three lemonades.... we ordered two of them but I didnt think there would be another one on there when she wanted more.  Most places on the strip and local restaurants like King's fish house do not charge for more soda.\n\nWe had a good dessert....... a trio something for dessert..... cannot remember the exact name but it had a scoop of vanilla gelato, a choc moose cake and some tiramisu and the dessert was really good.  That there was nothing left of :)"

Our waiter was very knowledgable of their dishes, which, is helpful if someone in your party has a food allergy.

My friend said it was one the best dishes she ever had.  They have about 4-5 GF options on their menu, sadly, not for desert. They start you off with a healthy bread basket (not GF) with olive oil and balsamic to dip it in.  Our meals came out fairly quickly and are decent portions.  I got the gnocchi, which, I typically do no order.  However, with that said, if I lived near this restaurant, I would go once a week for their gnocchi, it was delicious.

            "review": "I was going to see Zumantiy again Monday night and I decided to give Il Fornaio a try.  I'm glad I did.\n\nI was seated for my 5 PM reservation immediately.  The place was almost empty so I should have been.  I was asked my choice of eating on the casino facing patio or inside.  I chose inside.\n\nMy server, Carol, soon came to the table with bread and EVOO and balsamic vinegar.  She poured some EVOO onto a dish and then asked if I wanted any balsamic.  Thank you!  I don't like it when the two are mixed together on a bread plate. The bread basket had some focaccia and two rolls.  \n\nShe took my iced tea order and within a minute, the bus person working with her was at my table with the drink and some sweetener.  \n\nI had looked at the menu online but she pointed out the daily specials menu.  After looking that over, I changed my mind as to the main course.  For a starter, I ordered the grilled polenta with mushrooms and sheep's milk cheese.  The dish was very good.  The polenta with the mushrooms and the cheese made a great combination.\n\nThe main course is where I changed my mind.  I ordered off the specials menu the shell pasta in a gorgonzola cream sauce with sliced prosciutto. green peas, and topped with toasted walnuts.  The gorgonzola sauce was excellent and the addition of the crispy prosciutto and toasted walnuts gave it a great flavor and wonderful texture.  I'm glad they had the specials menu.  The pasta was brought to the table very hot.  \n\nFor dessert, I got the crema al doppio gusto.  The menu describes it as fennel-infused custard with chocolate mousse and caramelized sugar topping.  The dessert had the fennel custard on the bottom and was topped with the chocolate mousse and then a thin layer of sugar that had been caramelized with a torch.\n\nDuring the meal, Carol was attentive.  She checked in several times during my time there to make sure everything was OK.  The bus person removed dishes promptly and refilled my iced tea 3 times always without having to ask.  Outstanding.\n\nI am a fan!"

The service here is very slow and not friendly- I have to wait for a long time after l closed my menu and put it in the table and wait for the waiter to take my order. But I notice that other tables with more people seems to get the waiter's attention very quickly. I travel and eat alone a lot- I hate to think that people will treat you differently because of this, but that is what happened today. Perhaps people think a single Asian person won't tip well-but the truth is, people don't tip you well because you are not doing your job, especially since I have the similar job experiences before so I know what needs to be done, and apparently you are not doing it. The food ( breakfast) here is average with a price on the higher side. But the atmosphere is just not good nor comfortable. There won't be a third time for me to come."

I was very pleased with my choice. \n\nMy husband got the pancakes with real maple syrup. The pancakes were done right, high quality maple syrup. We had no complaints!\n\nOur service was good and quick, the view was lovely from the \"outside\" (really inside, just a casino view)...

The bread basket came our nice and warm with a plate full of olive oil and vinegar. My husband ordered Bistecca alla fiorentina, medium rare. Let me say this was a nice thick cut T-Bone steak! It was cooked perfectly, we were really impressed with the spinach and potato's. They were delicious, my husband normally doesn't eat spinach, however he was not wanting to share. My daughter decided to have seafood and ordered the Grigliate di Pesce mistro. I wasn't really impressed with this dish, The fish was very good however the calamari  and scallop seemed a little rubbery. I decided to order linguine mare chiaro. It was full of seafood and comes with a really tasty red sauce. The waiter suggested you can order it spicy and non-spicy I ordered spicy and to me it wasn't spicy at all. With three dinners and four nonalcoholic drinks our bill came out to $120 without tip. For what we ordered I feel like it wasn't bad at all, well worth it. I would definitely go back and try their pizza because the people next to us ordered four pizzas and they look delicious."

We were staying at the MGM and the restaurant is conveniently located in New York, New York (i.e., just across the street). \n\nOur party of six was seated on the \"outdoor\" patio adjacent to the casino floor. Slot machines were literally about 15 feet away. Not the best ambiance for a nicer restaurant.\n\nAs for the food, it was decent but nothing too exciting and largely overpriced. While my margarita pizza was much larger than I expected for $14 and easily enough for two meals, my friend's salmon plate seemed incredibly tiny for $25. Would it really hurt you to throw in a little extra sides? Maybe it's just because I'm crazy for potatoes but the few little bites on the plate wouldn't have satisfied me.\n\nOn the plus side, the waiter was pleasant and the complimentary bread and olive oil/vinegar was a nice touch."

Mostly for a good sandwich, sometimes for dinner.\n\nWe consider it one of the fewer locations on this part of The Strip where you can eat a decent sandwich. Meaning that not only the ingredients are fresh and the way it should be, but also the bread. It almost ressembles a proper Italian bakery.\n\nIn the little shop they serve sandwiches (dine in or out), pastries and small hot Italian dishes. All made from scratch. Unfortunately the coffee is not like Italians make it, but hey, this is Vegas baby! Not Rome.\n\nTip: you can ask for your sandwich to be pressed. If you do, make sure to  ask them to make it extra hot. We've noticed that if you don't the outside is very hot, but the inside is still cold. They serve really thick sandwiches.\n\nBoth in the little shop as in the restaurant the service is Italian. It doesn't bother us. Real American's might do.\n\nBecause of the prices, the Italian service and the coffee I'm not able to give five stars. For two sandwiches a hot tea and a fresh orange juice we paid almost $32. Even for Vegas stiff.\n\nAnd excuse any grammar or spelling mistakes. English is not my fist language. And if that isn't bad enough, my Apple device keeps changing the words into 'proper Dutch'.

I have never been served bruschetta with less than four pieces. For my entree I had the pasta with vodka sauce and the sauce tasted like it was straight from a jar.

It was a stuffed croissant filled with mostly cheese and scrambled eggs (not very much) and chunks of ham. I don't like ham, but there was no other choice if I wanted eggs, which is usually what people get with their breakfast. I could only eat half of it and had to toss it."

This is one of the only restaurants in the entire place and it sucked. There was a line to be seated that was pretty long. We truly thought that the place was spectacular because of it. It was our friends wedding night and they wanted to get a good dinner as did we. This place is over priced (it's Vegas), portions are tiny and the food is BLAND!\n\nNot to mention, our waiter was exceptionally rude. He didn't want to explain anything to us (seriously, reading that menu is like reading a foreign language), it took him 15 minutes to bring us our bread and oil and balsamic, and he did not once offer any refills (I was afraid to even ask in fear that they'd charge us for refills)\n\nAvoid this place at all costs. I rather would have tried the Irish restaurant on the other side of the casino."

I thought it was a nail or something from the cushioning.  The hostess was there and saw me pull my hand back and look at it - my finger had been punctured and was bleeding.  Investigation revealed that someone had put several toothpicks inside the cushioning pointing up and down.  If someone had sat on it they would have been injured. I suggested to the hostess that they close that table until they could check and clear the cushion.  I then asked for an antiseptic wipe to clean my finger.  A Manager showed up with an antiseptic wipe and a band aid.  He didn't ask, but I told him what had happened. He didn't offer an apology, but he was quick to say kids had sat at that table earlier and must have done that. While he was there, the hostess found another toothpick and the manager removed it.  He then left and we did not see him for the rest of the evening.  At the end of our meal we received the full check.  When we got home I emailed their corporate office explaining what had happened - no response.  The hostess was caring and great, food was pretty good.  Service besides the incident was decent."

There are truly better Italian restaurants off the strip for better prices if you want to venture out.  I would recommend taking the 10-15 cab ride off the strip to a local Italian establishment rather than settling here, but if you really need to eat at Il Fornaio it would not be your worst meal in Vegas."

The complimentary bread basket was pretty amazing. \n\nWe ordered a (huge) bowl of oatmeal and a veggie omelet, both were very good, tasty, and filling.

We always sit in their \"outdoor\" area which is off one of the main walkways of the casino. It's a great location to sit and people watch.\n\nOur favorite way to order is via their regional menu.  This option gives you a 3 course meal for about $35 per person. You get an appetizer, a second course, and then your main meal. Dessert is not included.  Plan on your tab being around $100 with a glass of wine each and maybe a cup of coffee to top off the meal.\n\nHere is a sample of the regional menu that is going to be offered in January 2017:\nhttps://www.ilfornaio.com/festa/2017/Core-Lombardia-menu17.pdf\n\nBe sure to sign up for their \"passport.\" You will accumulate points each time you dine, and then you can redeem the points for free coffee, dessert, and appetizer or even a complete regional meal.\n\nAnyway, as for this location the service is always perfect.  We were seated very quickly (which is what usually happens). We arrived at about 8:30pm.  Our waiter was wonderful. It turned out he was actually from Rome. So, it was great to have an \"authentic\" Italian serving us dinner and able to talk to us about the menu items.\n  \nMy husband ordered the Branzino (which is sea bass). He loves sea bass, but wasn't crazy about this dish.  Not because there was anything wrong with it...He just didn't read all the ingredients and it seemed like everything on the dish, other than the fish, was not his cup of tea, but I thought is was WONDERFUL.. it was covered with tomatoes and kalamata olives and Sicilian green olives and some mushrooms. It was SO flavorful and delicious.\n\nI ordered the salmon...It was good, It came with scalloped potatoes and some veggies. It was not as impressive as the Branzino, but still very good.\n\nWe also shared a wine flight that included 1/2 glass each of one red wine and 2 white wines..this was only $15, and the amount worked perfect for us. \n\nAs I said, I really love this place and it again did NOT disappoint."

A few examples: \n\nFirst, ordered regular coffee -- not espresso, cappuccino, etc. It was decent for being bulk coffee, so far, so good. After the first cup, it went downhill. Ordered a couple pastries to share while we waited. The small plates that were brought to use were wet, which if course wasn't apparent until after we had the pastries divided. Pools of water and anything, you know, bread-like don't mix. Take it away. \n\nNext up was the omelette with bacon and potatoes. A small amount of the bacon was ok, however the majority of it was burned beyond anything edible. The potatoes had more variety; they were either burned to a lesser degree or barely cooked through with no color, and not flavor to match. Eggs were cooked fairly acceptable, but lacked flavor. In fact, aside from the burned bacon flavor, the entire dish lacked much flavor at all. \n\nAnother breakfast on the table was scrambled eggs, with requested vegetables in it, which I'm certain the waitress did not understand so decided to literally ignore. Instead she brought \"salad fruit\". Thank you. Now take it back and bring what was ordered.\n\nSummary: very mediocre service, horrible culinary skills, and an all around sense of apathy. To be fair, they recognized that I was not pleased and removed some amount or other from the bill, which was welcome, but really need to fix the fundamental problems."

The prices weren't that cheap, as is with many in-hotel establishments, but the food was pretty good.\n\nI tried the ham/egg/cheese croissant ($6.29), the bacon/egg/cheese croissant ($6.59), and the blueberry scone.  The breakfast croissants were already made and in the display case - they just microwave it when you order it (therefore, it got kind of hard as it cooled down).  The blueberry scone was crumbly on the outside and soft on the inside...yum.\n\nA small coffee was $3.59 and lemonade $2.99.\n\nThey also sell baked breads and pastries, sandwiches, salads, cookies, and cakes, if I remember correctly.  A convenient place to get a quick bite when on the go or don't want to pay for sit-down restaurants."

After walking the strip we found the only seemingly-tasty eatery open at the New York-New York. Oh boy.\n\nThey were very open, so it wasn't like we came in like inconsiderate morons right before closing. Our section was very understaffed; one elderly man taking orders, filling waters, and serving food to literally everyone dining at that hour. He was still really friendly and it got our hopes up.\n\nIced tea was alright. Refills started lagging and I really understood however was bummed, because the food was all very, very... very salty. The bread was good, I always feel weird dipping bread into plain oil though, like one of those things Americans think is really upscale and authentic but it's really just something cranked out of the obese arteries that also crank out nasty 'Italian' chain restaurants like Macaroni Grill..\n\nWe each started with a house salad. $10 at Il Fornaio gets you a pile of floppy browning lettuce doused in Kraft Italian dressing. Literally. Unimpressive. \n\nHusband ordered the penne with vodka sauce and I ordered the lobster ravioli with cream sauce. Ha.. ha.. ha.. After a 45-minute wait after the salads were cleared, we were served the worst excuses for pasta. My 11-year old sister could make better pasta. I guess to Il Fornaio, 'cream sauce' means 'brown gravy flavored with fish'. I guess 'vodka sauce' is Easy Mac sauce with a sour aftertaste. My lobster was horrid. I'm not sure what it reminded me of, but it was so tough, like overcooked shrimp. It looked like overcooked shrimp too. Our entrees were so unappetizing we just gave up. Let me add that my husband has been in military training for the past year and is completely used to less-than-gourmet, and even he couldn't eat this stuff.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not against paying top dollar for food that deserves it [the next night we had a grade-A experience at Shibuya which ran us almost double]. This food deserved maybe ten bucks, total, because it reminded me of Bertolli frozen pasta dinners. But we got stiffed for $80 [before tip] for this hot mess. I think it's pretty obvious when food is unsatisfactory, but rather than asking if something was wrong with our food [as the other restaurants demanding this amount of money do], joked he wasn't taking our plates until we ate at least half of each our dishes.\n\nI'm going to make this easy for everyone: Il Fornaio is good if all you're used to is Olive Garden."

Disappointment is an understatement, as I am an Italian food junkie, and Il Fornaio was far from what I expected.  \n\nI ordered the Cannelloni con Pollo, which was decently sized, but was very bland, with WAY too much cheese.  I'm a fan of cheese, I understand the Italians are, too, but the cheese totally overpowered the sauce, which is a definite no-no in my book.  Oh yeah, marinara sauce?  Absolutely not!  All I could see was white.  Nothing marinara-y about it.  I ate a few bites willingly, and the rest I pretty much had to choke down, for the sole reason that I was paying close to 20 bucks for it, and was not ready to leave with this in a doggy bag to be finished later.  \n\nAtmosphere of the place is nice- it's right across from The Bar @ Times Square, so you can enjoy the old school piano songs while you dine.  They're a rowdy, loud, drunk bunch over there, which makes for interesting entertainment.\n\nIn a word- yuck.  Sorry, NYNY.  You've done better.  Il Fornaio gets two stars- 1 for the convenience of being at the hotel I happened to be staying at while in Vegas, and 1 for keeping me from starving to death in the wee hours of the night.

Maybe.\n\nAfter about 20 mins of tummy rumblings, we were finally seated. First off, the house bread wasn't impressive at all. I ordered the Pennoni Alla Vodka w/ a Crown and Ginger Ale to wash it down. They returned w/ a small almost shot cup sized mixed drink cup ($9.99!?) and a plate of pasta that looks like I could whip it up as a teen home alone on a hungry night. Seriously, if the cups were dogs, my mixed drink cup would have been a miniature pinscher. The pasta actually turned out to be pretty good because the apple smoked bacon and the vodka sauce saved it. Wifey went health nut on me for a change and ordered a \"Insalata cesarina\"...sounds fancy huh!? Yeah...they could have just put Caesar salad on the dang menu, but I guess they had to spruce it up for the genuine Italian feel.

And uhm, hello you have to question when your food comes out incredibly fast.  Did they just heat it up in the micro-wave?  The Riesling we had was so-so. And even Macaroni Grill gives us vinegar with olive oil and bread.  Sheesh."

I've been to Vegas a ton and know what to expect, but this one threw me for a loop.\n\nFor an appetizer we had the fried zucchini and onion rings. I liked that. Interesting that they gave us tartar sauce.\n\nMy entree was the vodka sauce which was bland. I asked for crushed red pepper and they gave me black pepper.\n\nThe diet coke had a bandaid taste to it.

I saw Il Fornaio Panetteria was a part of the restaurant week, so I decided to give the restaurant a try even though their Yelp rating wasn't very high. I appreciated that some of the money from restaurant week in Las Vegas went to charities. The restaurant is located inside of New York-New York hotel. For starters, the server brought out bread with olive oil. The bread was pretty good. For my appetizer, I had the flat bread and Caesar salad. I enjoyed both appetizers. The flat bread and Caesar salad were made to order and fresh.I had the Pennoni alla Vodka which was pasta tubes with applewood-smoked bacon, vodka-cream-tomato sauce and parmesan cheese. The Pennoni alla Vodka was delicious. I had tiramisu for dessert. I really enjoyed every bite of the tiramisu. The service was good. The waiter was attentive and really nice.Il Fornaio Panetteria has a romantic atmosphere even though it's in a hotel/casino. You can sit inside the restaurant or outside (inside of New York-New York casino area).The 3 course meal at Il Fornaio Panetteria was solid. I give Il Fornaio Panetteria a 3.5 rating!"

The portions were fine, and the eggplant was not bad.  The pizza, though, was nothing special at all.  In fact, it was slightly tricky to eat since the \"crust\" [a term I will use loosely here] was neither foldable nor particularly firm.\n\nThe table itself was too small and the waiter was very slow and forgetful.  When the pizza came out, as the guy sliced it he knocked into a glass and spilled a bit-- a combination of tiny table and clumsiness, though I'm not factoring \"these things happen\" in to my impression.\n\nAt the end of the day, the place was a little bit more expensive than it really should be and the atmosphere was somewhat lacking, but it wasn't horrible and perhaps you might have a better experience with a larger table and some different menu choices."

We were seated for dinner at a long table in what's usually the bakery, but we were able to order from their regular menu. We were served complimentary bread while we looked over the menu, and we also ordered drinks. I got an alright pomegranate martini for about $14.\n\nAfter glancing over the prices for their regular menu items (between $17 and $28 for various kinds of pasta) we were informed of a $30 dinner special they were offering as a part of Restaurant Week. $4 would go to charity and it was a great selection of food as well - the $30 included an appetizer (minestrone, flatbread, or salad), entree (chicken, vodka sauce fettucine, or salmon), and dessert (tiramisu or zabaione with berries). Most of my group went for the $30 offer, including me.\n\nThe minestrone was well-seasoned, warm, and filling. It was appropriately portioned as well. I wish I had gone with the salmon instead of the chicken, but it turned out to be well-cooked and juicy with some nice potatoes on the side. Wasn't too big a fan of the quickly-sauteed spinach that served as the bed, though. The zabaione was a nice way to end the meal - nice and light after a pretty heavy dish.\n\nIn my opinion, an Italian restaurant should either be super affordable and homey-tasting, or more expensive/splurgy but worth it in quality and innovation. This place didn't do either. I can't say I'd spend $30 here when my company wasn't paying for it (haha) but it was an okay experience nonetheless."

So I thought, all right, this sounds promising....\n\n...until we entered NYNY's Little Italy and saw it was Il Fornaio. Now, I had been to the Il Fornaio in Coronado and it was a horrible experience for me (http://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-coronado-2#hrid:ba8JuHA3NGLfZWqt9HWEcA). I hurriedly warned my friends about the bad food and slow service for this place's chain, but they brushed me off by assuring me this is the best pasta in town.\n\nWrong. Although the service was not as slow as the one in Coronado, the food portions were super small. Because my friend and I knew we didn't want to spend $20+ for a pasta dish here, we had agreed to split, which made the already small portions even smaller. We had some linguine with vodka sauce and it was bland and meh. We each only got to eat around 3 small slices of sausage which were nothing special as well. I only left without remaining hungry because I'd decided to fill my stomach with their bread and dip to get my money's worth.\n\nHowever, the worst part came when we were leaving Il Fornaio. While we were waiting for our credit card receipts, one of our friends was looking at the \"menu stand\" restaurants sometimes have outside for advertisement. Well, he accidentally knocked it over and we discovered what was behind the stand. There was a \"C\" rating for Il Fornaio's health inspection. WHAT?! I have NEVER been to a C-rated restaurant. And what's worse is that they even tried to hide it with their menu board. Wow, I felt like we had been scammed. \n\nIl Fornaio, you have once again disappointed me. I will never get dragged to any of your other chains again, even if it means standing outside waiting for my friends to finish their food while my stomach grumbles in hunger."

Some of the best italian food on the west coast, and my mom lives out there so that's saying a lot. I ordered canneloni, which is hard enough to find as it is, and my friend had the lasagna. I wanted both for myself. Their menu was also decently priced, especially for Vegas. \n\nOur server was excellent. I wish I remember his name, but he was very nice and extremely helpful. He recommended a few little-known hot spots off the strip, and chatted with us despite being the only one serving the entire patio. We were also seated right away, which is a rarity on a holiday weekend in Vegas when you don't have a reservation.\n\nWhile I love the food and the atmosphere of the hotel itself was great, the set up of the restaurant was odd. They have a patio, which would normally be fantastic, but it's still inside the hotel, so you're actually eating on the casino floor. I love to people watch, but it was hard to hear any conversation with all the noise from the slots and passersby. Maybe if they covered it or put in a glass wall it would be a bit more bearable, but the food is more than worth the noise. \n\nIf you're looking for great italian on a budget in Vegas, Il Fornaio is it!"

I am so glad that we changed our minds! \nI had been to an Il Fornaio in Walnut Creek, CA a couple weeks before so I recogized the name. The drinks were yummy and the food was fantastic. My pizza was perfectly cooked and my fiance's salmon was seasoned well and not over or under cooked at all. I was excited to find out that there is a location closer to where I live in Carmel, CA so I think I will be going there next time I am in the need for a fancy dinner."

We were trying to have a romantic evening, starting off with some enjoyable conversation over a glass of wine, and I wanted so badly to yell at the kitchen to please shut the hell up.\n\nAfter that, it was all hands on deck while they set up a table for fourteen next to us. I would have expected them to know enough to work quietly and not disturb the guests. But this crew was just the opposite--talking back & forth and laughing like a bunch of frat boys at a ball game. It completely changed Il Fornaio from up-scale Italian restaurant to no-frills Mexican tacqueria.\n\nDon't get me wrong--that may be the atmosphere they're going for.

It came with some potatoes that were nice as well. It was a bit pricy, but that's to be expected. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs - omelets, french toast, etc. Nobody seemed blown away by theirs, but nobody really complained. \n\nNow the reason for the two stars, despite the decent food - really, really slow service. Unacceptably so. It took 10 minutes to get our drinks, and refills required your offer of a first born child. Our server, while okay (but not great) as far as friendliness goes, was never around to show or provide much. And there were barely any tables sat. Food can't make up for service."

I was searching for a restaurant on the strip offering a $30.11 menu in participation with \"Restaurant Week.\"  We had originally decided on the Italian restaurant in the Tropicana, but unfortunately it is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, thus we ended up here. \n\nWe came in a party of four and we each ordered from the prix fixe menu.  Bread was served after sitting down and having our drink orders taken.  It came with oil and vinegar.  The bread was good, I wish it was warm though.  Macaroni Grill has way better bread, in my opinion.  My sister started with a salad and the rest of us had minestrone soup.  I can't comment on the salad, although it looked fresh.  The minestrone soup was just okay.  I'm used to minestrone soup containing beans/pasta, but this was just a basic minestrone soup, containing only vegetables.  I used a little salt and pepper for seasoning.  \n\nNext, we moved on to the main entree.  I had the chicken.  I could tell this chicken was of low quality.  It came with steamed spinach and roasted Yukon potatoes.  It's sad when a roasted potato is the star of the show.  I was not impressed.  The other three dishes were two salmon orders and one of the penne alla vodka.  I can't comment on the penne, but it looked good.  My sister liked it.  I did catch a bite of the salmon.  It was decent.  It was served with broccolini and Yukon potatoes.  The broccolini looked limp and overcooked.  It did not look appetizing.  \n \nFinally, we were served dessert.  The tiramisu was forgettable.  It wasn't rich in flavor, I didn't even taste of hint of rum.  The other dessert ordered was some kind of sorbet with fruit and whipped cream.  It was just okay, nothing to write home about.\n\nThe service was spotty.  Our waiter didn't have much of a personality and he seemed rushed at times.  The \"water lady/busser\" didn't speak a lick of English.  I asked for four wedges of lemon for our water which never made it to the table because she didn't understand, I guess.  \n\nI expected better quality of food and service than what we received.  If you are looking for a restaurant to try for \"Restaurant Week,\" I suggest you overlook this place.  There are far better options, on and off the strip."

There was good mood lighting, and I suppose this would be a good place to have a date.\n\nThey gave us bread upon seating and it was pretty damn good. Soft sourdough slices with some olive oil really hit the spot. Service was a bit slow throughout the night but we got our food pretty quickly.\n\nDinner:\n\nPorterhouse steak- I know porterhouse isn't the best cut of beef you can get but damn... Im not a steak eater but this was good. It took my breath away. Buttery, smooth, flavorful. Made me a believer. I don't even know what to say...\n\nPollo Tuscan- Buttery and tender. Really good, light meal. Came with garlic/Rosemary potatoes and thin carrots. Solid meal. Personally, I would take the sourdough bread (see above) and shove some chicken in between... \n\nMoving onto desserts: \nTiramisu- Top 5 best tiramisus I've had\n\nPanna Cotta- This one is layered with strawberry and mango. It would've been better without the fruit but still good mixed with the mango. \n\nOverall, a good experience here. I would recommend whether you're a local or a tourist."

Thinking ahead, she made reservations well in advance - and that was a welcome decision as we entered to discover the line around the corner. No issues for us - we gave our names to the hostess and were seated in less than 5 minutes.\n\nThe server greeted us and took provided water immediately upon seating. She returned with a basket of bread and butter soon afterwards. My friends each ordered a glass of wine and we shared an order of Calamaretti Fritti. For an entree one ordered Conchiglie al Pollo, the other Pennoni alla Vodka, and I the Barilotti alla Valtellina. Mine came in a bowl filled with whole wheat pasta, cabbage, potatoes, string beans, portobello mushrooms, Fontina and Grana Padano cheese, butter and sage. It was very good, but also very large. I ate about half of it and was finished. The price was good for that dish at 15.99. The other two dishes were $18.59 and 16.99, respectively. \n\nAll restaurants on the strip fill up quickly - especially on a weekend that featured the Las Vegas marathon, a bullriding championships and a country music award show - make reservations!

No real bad experiences, but every time I'm there the wait staff looks different, so the real bad reviews you see here may be partially attributable to high turnover.\n\nThe food quality has always been good, but there is a wide variation in \"heaviness\" of the dishes.  The food is \"northern Italian\" which tends to be a bit richer than typical southern Italian dishes.  There is lots of dishes which feature heavier, creme-type sauces.  I personally don't prefer this, so I order lighter items such as the vegetarian pizza, spagetti with cuttlefish sauce (that's not it's exact name, but I can't remember it right now).  There is a couple simple salads which are excellent.  The desserts are also very good.  I've also had the mannicotti, which was okay, but had a heavy sauce which made it richer than I'd like.

Every time we passed by this place there were tons of people and the place seemed nice, so on our last morning we decided to give it a try. And here starts the reasons for just 2 stars:\n1. We walked up to the podium a min after the couple ahead of us. Instead of greeting the two of us as well and the host COMPLETELY ignored us! He just acknowledged the first couple and took them to their table, not so much as a smile in our direction. I would have been willing to overlook this if the meal hadn't continued in the wrong direction.\nBefore I go on, a kudos to the management: My bf ordered waffles and I ordered an omelette. About 5 min after our order was taken the manager headed over with a beautiful plate of waffles. He explained that their waffle machine had been broken all morning and it just started working again. The manager didn't want to take the chance that his client wouldn't get the requested order and so decided to let the order go out early. Nicely done.\n2. My bf didn't want to start eating before me and we figured an egg couldn't take too long, so we kept chatting and waited. The table that was seated after us received their eggs and I was still foodless (this was 20 min after the waffles arrived). Just as I was about to say something I saw our waiter realize the mistake and turn a 180 on his heels back to the kitchen. However, he did not see that I had witnessed his mistake and was expecting him to head over to our table to give a small apology for the wait. Not so. When my omelette finally arrived I expected that to be his opportunity to give a small 'I'm sorry'. Not so. The mistake was never acknowledged, quite the contrary, our waiter ignored us through the whole meal!\nThat should teach me not to expect."

Our water glasses were constantly filled, our request for more oil and vinegar came immediately, empty plates were cleared off the table quickly.  I really appreciated our waitress' attentiveness and outstanding service.\n\nSecond, the inside dining area was beautiful and quiet.  It had an outstanding atmosphere for conversation.  The place was incredibly clean, spacious and chique.   I  thought the restaurant was a bit too dark but I guess it created a more intimate ambiance. \n\nThird, the food was outstanding and, with the special 3-course meal for $33, we thought it was very reasonably priced.  The bread served to us at the beginning was crisp outside and soft delicious inside.  \n\nWhat did I order? I cannot remember (let alone pronounce) the fancy Italian words so bear with me as I describe the items I ordered. The appetizer was a flatbread which was almost the size of an A4 paper covered with toppings and lots lots lots of delicious cheese.  The main consisted of spinach, grilled chicken and potatoes. The spicy sauce was really the superstar of that plate.  It was too bad that I ran out of sauce halfway though my chicken. Next time, more sauce please!  And, finally, for my dessert, I ordered the tiramisu - a large square-shaped decadent light fluffy cake with layers of rich creamy coffee filling.  \n\nIf there's anything to improve, I'd say the portions have to be smaller.  Strange how my feedback contradicts the complaint from a previous reviewer saying the portions were too small?  I found the appetizer was far too large and (combined with the bread at the beginning) I've eaten too many carbs that, by the time I reached my main, I was already full and couldn't enjoy it as much.  By the time dessert came, I was full beyond comfort and had to pack it up.  \n\nOverall - I enjoyed the dining experience at Il Fornaio and would recommend it to everyone (who isn't on the Atkins diet!!!!)"

For around 20 a plate in a casino worth probably over 100 million, this level of quality is abhorrent. \n\nThe pasta seemed like a box of barilla I could have cooked from walmart, coated in a novice chefs sauce that was like watered down wine mixed with Kraft italian dressing. The lasagna was better, but only because the cheap meat and cheese covered the ragu sauce (as described on menu actually as RAGU). The salad was soggy and dressing poor. The highlight of the meal was the packaged balsamic vinegar served with the bread. Very poor food, made worse by the exorbitant prices.\n\nThe service was also extremely poor, we were only visited by the busboy who kept refilling our glasses. The waiter was mostly absent.\n\nAtmosphere was nice, if a little cheesy, but a live concert which seemed to be going on in the casino was a bit distracting during a meal.\n\nCould have got an equivalent meal at sbarros for significantly cheaper.\n\nDon't make the mistake.

Such a great environment to dine at with great service. \n\nUnfortunately, the food failed to even remotely impress us.. The best part of our meal was sadly the basket of bread in the beginning - warm, toasted deliciousness! \n\nI don't remember the exact name of the items from the menu since they're all in Italian so....\n\n//VEGGIE OMELET (1.5/5): literally so meh. The omelet was extremely thick, overcooked, and had no real distinct flavor, besides egg.. And cooked vegetables. We had to dump hot sauce and ketchup on it to make it more enticing to eat, but my mom still didn't finish it. Oh well. The potatoes were really good atleast! \n\n//SMOKED HAM BENEDICT (2.5/5): This dish had a LOT of potential.... The cream-Parmesan sauce for the Benedict was addicting and the potatoes they served with it were crispy and perfectly seasoned. However, the eggs were overcooked, bread was too hard until I let it get soggy, and I had to soak everything in the cream sauce to make the Benedict taste good. The yolk didn't even spill out..... \n\n//BUTTERMILK PANCAKES (3/5): Very meh. The pancakes were moist and not dry at all, but that was the only good thing about them. Besides that there was no defining flavor and the pancakes were a little too soggy. Oh well, atleast they didn't stick to the roof of my mouth like most other pancakes! \n\nOverall, I don't know how the rest of the food is here, but I wouldn't come back for breakfast. Thanks for the great service and atmosphere though!"

The espresso was INCREDIBLE. I mean INCREDIBLE. We live in the era of Starbucks so anytime you can have real espresso pulled by hand, it's such a treat.\n\nDinner was awesome. Only issue was that the minestrone wasn't great :( I got the seafood sampler with calamari, prawn, scallops, grilled polenta, and veggies - a cool $27 but GOOD. Hubby got fettuccine alfredo - nothing spectacular. Dad got the calzone - said it was good and it was very large.\n\nThe best part about the meal was the waiter - wish I could remember his name so I could give him proper recognition. He was witty and friendly without being too familiar, and kept us laughing and entertained throughout the whole meal. You don't generally experience genuinely good service like this anymore, especially in Vegas, so it's quite welcome when it happens :)\n\nOverall, good.

When we went around 940 it was not busy but as soon as we sat down the line went out the store. the store is small, there are small side tables for two people and there is a large table for a big party if you have one. definitely limited seatinf. Got the oatmeal and two boiled eggs. Very good! Coffee is good and strong. Friends got the everything bagel and the croissant and cheese. They enjoyed their food as well. \n\nDefinitely stop by for some affordable yummy food!!!"

After we were done they told us we could not split the check. But we could pay with separate credit cards, they had us (the customer) add up each persons individual bill and include tax for him to run our cards. Also gratuity was included in the bill, which they did not deserve. These people are crooks, don't support their business."

From the food to the service you really cannot go wrong.\n\nService: Miguel the host was amazing.  He was SO good to us every single morning that we went to the restaurant.  It is because and thanks to him that our experience was always 5 stars.  The manager was also very good to my family and I.\n\nThank you Vania Carlos & Jefferson for great service as well.  Very sweet and attentive.\n\nFood:  The food was amazing!! I ordered the Omellete Verdure every day for four days straight.   This did not bore me in any way.  Actually,  it was the complete opposite of boring. It was the best omelette I have ever had in my life. EXTREMELY FRESH INGREDIENT WARNING.  Omelette came with fresh crunchy asparagus spears, zucchini, and fresh broccoli florets.  UNBELIEVABLE.  They also put rosemary in their omelettes which I think is genius.\n\nAmbiance: Great if you dine on the terrace!!\n\nWaffles are delicious.  They come with banana, strawberry, and whip cream YUMM\n\nThe bread is beyond.  Obviously made by their own bakery.  SO DELICIOUS.  \n\n\nThank you for the amazing food and amazing experience!"

I picked the one with the most reviews.\n\nHad a late dinner here after catching Zumanity.  Kudos to them for being open till midnight.\n\nDidn't opt for any apps, just worked out our jaws on their bread and butter which was ok.  Oh how I wish every restaurant served bread like you get at Craftsteak.  I got the veal with sliced artichokes with lemon and veggies with roasted potatoes.  Overall my food was enjoyable.  The tiramisu was good and I love me some italian espresso.\n\nUnfortunately, they start blasting music from the bar in the middle of the casino floor which made our dining experience somewhat uncomfortable.  \n\n3 stars"

Server forgot our bread, entree, and water. As we sat there we noticed our table was not the only one with the same problem.  So naturally we did speak to the Manager. He addressed the issue, provided a gracious discount and said he would speak to his staff server who completely failed at doing his job. Hopefully if we venture here again, possibly... the issue never happens again."

The service SUCKS. I dont know why the nice lady infront or our waiter did not let us know they were closing in 30 mins before we ordered. That guy was all talking up a 40 buck bottle of wine, what for... as soon as he brought our super strong Grappa and coffee he disappeared. He showed up to tell us \" we were suposed to close 5 mins ago\" so we asked for the check. This fool comes back 10 mins later asking us if we want to order something else... Then pulled our check outta his jacket. WTF. Man we shoulda jus went to a buffet like I said earlier."
