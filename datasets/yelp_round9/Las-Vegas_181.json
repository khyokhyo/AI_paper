I all of a sudden felt ripped off but am too embarrassed to say \"oh, then I don't want the chocolate croissant\"\n\nso fine. I paid it. And almost instantly regretted getting the chocolate croissant. It tasted like it's been sitting there for the entire day and was hard to bite into. Definitely not what I had dreamed of...a soft, flaky, buttery croissant :(\n\nThank God the Pb&J macaroon was delicious! It was chewy on the outside, peanut butter on the inside filled with strawberry jam in the center! But is this worth $3? NO WAY, JOSE! I complain when I have to pay $1.50 for a small macaroon! Now, you're just pressing my buttons. This place is a one time only deal."

I thought it was a full on bakery but it's more like a side stand (like those Starbucks stands in the mall).  Anyway, all of their stuff looked great but I came to try the macaroons.  I'm not even a macaroon fan but I had to try.  I purchased two, the raspberry and one of the seasonal which was a blue earl grey.  \n\nI could do without the earl grey one, the flavor just didn't do it for me.  It was a weird combo of flavors.  Wasn't bad...but wasn't great.\n\nThe raspberry one though...so good!  The textures, crisp on the outside but soft inside.  Definitely became a macaroon fan!"

They're much larger than the pictures would lead you to believe.\n\nThe thing that really bothered me though is that I purchased half a dozen so they didn't fit in the box completely. Given that I bought these macarons with my suitcase, I assumed the person helping me knew that I was going to be traveling at some point.\n\nWrong! Came home to broken macarons because of the hollow crispiness. Tears ensued. But a delicious macaron nonetheless!"

It's $3.50 a pop but it's the bigger one so you can really enjoy and savor each and every bite without having to worry that it'll all be gone after just two meager bites. I had the chocolate and pistachio. Both were fantastic! Not too sweet, texture is just perfect, filling is not overwhelming but still rich in flavor. You can tell there's so much love put into that pastry. I will come back to try more flavors and their other pastries the next time I'm in Vegas. \n\nPrepare to look for this place. We got lost a couple of times before finally getting here. It is located near the casino under/behind the escalators."

I think I've pretty much tried all the flavors. Vanilla, pistachio and coffee are my favorites.

We had a horrible time trying to find this place and had I not been so big of a fan I would have just given up (BTW it is located in the building with the clock in a small location right by the strip). The place is super small and has a little patio outside with a few seats. These seats, unfortunately, were overtaken with a few homeless people and some drunk people sleeping the night off. We tried a TLC, TKO and the carrot cake cookies. The only one that stood out was the carrot cake cookie - the rest were unimpressive. I really wanted to love this place but alas I did not."

I guess I just expected more from this bakery. :( \n\nWould probably not come back for the macarons., or the coffee."

We were very disappointed as everything we tried was very ordinary.  \n\nTried the coffee macaron and chocolated dipped pistachio macaron. Good coffee flavor butno pistachio flavor.  Pistachio one actually reminded me of a chocolate dipped mint oreo cookie.  Regardless, both too sweet. Strawberry croissant tasted like a strawberry Entenmann's coffee cake.  No kidding.  Carrot cake sandwich thing unmemorable and lacking in flavor.  Nutter Better cookie sandwich also forgettable and a bit on the overly sweet side.  Cheese danish was the most likeable of the items we got but also unimpressive.  The only reason it stood out in any way was the excellent cream cheese frosting on top. \n\nOverall, skip it."

I have tried these croissants at many other places (Aria, Caesar's, etc.), and Bouchon has the best.  Crispy, airy croissants with a ton of filling.  It's not greasy and it's so delicate.  The macarons are delicious.  The blueberry croissants were interesting, but not as good.  Very tart and too much filling so it made it mushy.  The Kouign Amann is good too.  I was at the Palazzo at the Venetian, so I was lucky enough to stop by Bouchon every morning.  Delicious!"

My husband and I were in Vegas for vacation this summer (June 2013) and our first morning we went for coffee at Bouchon.\nWe were surprised when we saw the coffee mug given to us. One of the coffee cup had disturbing Racist comments written over it.  We were shocked but did not wanted to argue with the servers.\nWe went directly to the hotel concierge and the manager was called. They were shocked to read it too. The hotel security was called and a complaint was filed against the bakery staff. \nWe were told that the matter would be investigated and someone from the bakery will contact us within 24 hours. We were there for 4 days and never ever heard back anything. Our whole vacation was spoiled because of this disturbing experience.\nAfter about 3 weeks when I called the bakery manager she admitted that she was aware of the situation and started making stories that it was the customer's fault.\nWhen I told her that I was the customer, she completely flipped and said ,\"oh let me investigate and call you back.\" Since then I have never ever heard anything from them.\n\nThe WORST customer service I have ever seen in my life !!!!!"

There is no seating, but there is a shared seating area upstairs. Selection is slightly different at each one. The manager works downstairs, so if you have a 25% off coupon from the Bouchon restaurant, you need to go there to use it. There wasn't a line the times we went.\nI bought a pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant shaped into a rectangular roll) for breakfast. It was flaky and delicious, however, it needed more chocolate! There were only a few chips...disappointing. However, the other baked goods I got to take home were excellent.\nFirst up was a strawberry cupcake. It was gorgeously made and topped with a small chocolate disk. This one tasted like it had buttermilk in the batter. It was moist and ever-so-slightly tangy. Really excellent paired with the strawberry cream. As good as the ones I make! ;)\nThen, I got 4 different flavors of macarons. The vanilla one was fine, as expected. The chocolate caramel was the favorite. Rich caramel flavors in the filling. Delicious! Strawberry and chocolate were good also. The macarons are about 1/3 larger than the usual. They have a perfect crunchy exterior, the frilly \"feet\" that are mandatory for macarons, and the right amount of creamy filling. The texture is slightly chewy at room temperature. If you do refrigerate them, make sure they come up to room temp before serving.\nOverall, expensive, but worth it. Can't go wrong with the cupcakes and macarons."

I heard there was a bouchon here and thought I'd try it. I also heard they have good macarons so thought I'd give that a go as well.\n\nIf you like really good croissants, don't get there's. Honestly, it tasted like a day old croissant from Costco. Not that there isn't a place for those, but it isn't at an extremely reputable patisserie. \n\nMore disappointing than the croissant was the raspberry macaron. It is currently sitting here next to me half uneaten and I can't decide whether I should finish eating it or not. \nIf you have had really good macarons either here or in Paris you know it shouldn't be crunchy at all, not hard, but perfectly doughy and fall apart in your mouth as your lips close on it.\n\nThis macaron, again, tastes a day old, it's hard,crunchy, and too cold. \n\nIf you haven't had a macaron before, don't have this one or else you'll think macarons themselves are disappointing. The flavor is ok, however. \n\nVerdict: if you like real authentic croissants and macarons, dont come here. \n\nTant pis..."

The bakery itself is pretty tiny, at least the one that I visited was. There's really no room to sit so you just grab your order and take it outside or back to your hotel room.

There's a counter under the escalators coming from the parking garage to the casino floor, next to the elevators going to the hotel room... And little shops at street level in from of Venetian, and close to the the skybridge leading to TI. \n\nI visit the counter by the guest elevators (a few times). \n\nThere's several employees behind the counter. Service was okay, but a bit rushed, even when there wasn't much of a line. \n\nOatmeal cookie- large. Full of flavor. So so chewy. I bought it and ended up not eating it until 2 days later, still so fresh tasting.\n\nGranola bar- sweet and chewy. Also really good. \n\nChocolate almond croissant- so crisp and flaky on the outside... But soft, moist, and buttery inside. Just enough chocolate bits and a nice amount of almond spread. Just a bit messy to eat! \n\nMacarons- I got one of each flavor. Again I didn't eat right away, instead, I took it home and stored it in the fridge. Next day, the macarons still tasted very fresh. Delicate cookie, soft, and chewy. The vanilla and chocolate ones were very sweet and rich. The flavors were kinda plain actually... The PB&J macaron tasted a bit like the chocolate one, but with jelly/jam in it.. The size of hockey pucks, just one is enough to satisfy any sweet craving you might be having. I'm hopeful that the pistachio one I have left at home has a flavor I'm more excited about..\n\nOverall, I loved Bouchon and will definitely come back to try some of their other items next time I'm in town... Everything had a fresh taste and with quality ingredients."

It went like this...\"wow...ahhhh...ummmm....wow....awesome....etc\" and it went like that for the next 15 minutes because that's how long it takes to finish just one macaron.\n\nThey're $3.50 per macaron, but they are more than 3 times the size of a standard sized macaron. It pretty much fits right into the palm of your hand. So you get the quantity as well. But the quality far exceeds every other macaron I've ever had including the ones in Paris.\n\nBouchon, you have won me over. C'est la vie. My first one was the pistachio and it was phenomenal. The flavors just kept coming and coming. It was non-stop. Whatever they did to these macarons, I just had to buy more.\n\nSo I got the 6-pack as well. For $17.50, you definitely save a lot more instead of just buying one and you get one of each flavor available. I got everyone in the group onboard with my macaron frenzy and they too enjoyed and devoured their piece. Me on the other hand, wanted to savor this 6-pack at home and I regret not buying another box.\n\nThe 6-pack includes the raspberry, chocolate, lemon, pistachio, cinnamon and coffee. I'm not going to make another essay out of my macaron review, but essentially all of them were of the 5-star quality. No bullshit here. \n\nI also got one of the giant chocolate cookies, $3.50. Again, savor this one, because this one is rich, full of buttery chocolate flavor.\n\nThey have a few other Bouchon's out there including one up in the Napa Valley area. NV, you are now on my bucket list for a future visit and some more macarons. And yah, next Vegas trip will involve another visit to the Bouchon. Good job on giving me the best macarons in the universe."

Stuff is not cheap here, but it is well worth the price difference.\n\nNot just that, but the staff there was nice and efficient.  I really wanted to give them a thumbs up for having the patience to deal with this crazy Chinese lady that held up the line for 20 minutes on 12/30.  She kept claiming that they overcharged her and demanded that they give her some cash back.  You might think, \"Okay, she really could have gotten screwed by some error,\" but then a few things happened that convinced me otherwise.\n\nAfter the manager refused to give her whatever cash she wanted, she said something to the effect of, \"I know Thomas Keller, and this is not how he would want his business run.  I'm going to let him know how you people are treating me.\"\n\nThe manager eventually gave her some money just to move her along, and then she pulled the following... She took her bag of pastries (just 2), went off to the side, and when the workers weren't paying attention, she put the bag back down on the counter.  When the worker came back to the register, she yelled, \"Where are my pastries?!?\"  The worker responded, \"I just gave them to you.\"  The lady decided not to respond, and just reached over and grabbed the bag that she had JUST PUT DOWN.  I think she was trying to con her way into some extra freebies.\n\nThis whole scenario was quite ludicrous in person, and events like these are what make me skeptical of a lot of people's yelp reviews (customers aren't always right, and half the time are crazy).  Regardless, kudos to the Bouchon Bakery workers for keeping a level head and not flipping out after having to deal with this insane person."

Just the right amount of subtle chewiness combined with light flaky crispiness  I recommend buying a box of their mini macarons (they're actually the same size as regular macarons you would find anywhere else) for $12 (which comes out to $2 per macaron); then, you can try them all and determine which one you like the most before you buy the bigger individual ones for $3.50 each.\n\nI wish they had more flavors.  They have a total of six flavors: vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, raspberry, coffee and caramel.  My favorite flavors were vanilla and raspberry.  The chocolate and coffee macarons were too rich for me.    Pistachio and caramel were descent.\n\nDefinitely check this place out when you're at The Venetian!"

When we got to the Venetian there was a Bouchon bakery right at the entrance after the walkway but it was tiny. I thought it was bigger when I saw it online so we looked at the map and saw there were three locations around the hotel. We decided to try a different one on another floor and when we got to that one it was pretty small but slightly bigger than the first one we saw and had a crazy long line. We jumped in line and when the lady took our order she was incredibly rude. You then get some of your food unless you are getting something heated up at which point you have to go wait in another line where everyone is waiting for coffee at this tiny little window area on the side. I probably stood a good 10 minutes waiting for my food to be heated up dodging people picking up their coffee. There are no tables nearby to eat at so we headed up to the food court to eat. \n\nOverall there was a small selection of food, no blended drinks (I can't stand drinking hot coffee in hot weather) or even iced drinks. The food was mediocre and not really worth the hassle. After getting home I realized I should have just went to Bouchon the restaurant not the little bakery stands as I would have avoided the whole mess."

Their croissants are to die for, not greasy or too much flour, just right.  But their star is definately the oversized macaroons. I didn't even know what the hell macaroons were, but it was rich, sweet, almost fluffy treat, all you need to know. They have 6 different flavors, pistashio, almond, vanilla, chocoloate, lemon, strawberry.  Goes great with coffee in the AM or a light pick my up snack in the afternoon.  This place does get crowded, but the lines go really quick with attentive staff.

Bouchon for breakfast every day!\n\nI only managed to take a picture of my almond croissant because I would devour everything else I bought without thinking.  Also, because I was hungry.  On this trip I got almond croissants, a chocolate chip cookie and a breakfast sandwich.  YES, everything was amazing.  I've also tried their macarons in the past.  Their macarons are huge.  To me, their macarons are the next best ones after Laduree. That's saying a lot!\n\nTheir breakfast sandwich is cheese, an egg and bacon in a croissant.  They warm it up for you and the croissant becomes this soft flaky heaven.  This sandwich is also huge by the way.  I'm sad I couldn't finish it.  Their chocolate chip cookie is wonderfully soft.  So soft, it stayed almost it's natural state 3 days later in the bag in my hotel lol. I couldn't eat it all at once but still tasted great the third day.  I got the almond croissant almost daily to have some sort of carb readily available in my room.  So good.

However, I award stars relative to what I expect of a particular establishment, based on it's sister restaurants, press, chef, and overall reputation.\n\nBeing the baby sister to the high-end, \u00fcber-famous French Laundry under the keen eye of masterful chef Thomas Keller, one should expect a modicum of basic service standards in a restaurant with such a pedigree.\n\nHowever, the food and service were disappointingly mediocre at best.  Aside from the incredible pastries and outdoor ambiance, this restaurant leaves nothing to be desired.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the ridiculous parking-garage, elevator-changing, treasure-hunt required to find the restaurant, prepare yourselves.\n\nOnce you have finally made your way to the entrance, it is likely you will be graciously greeted by a host/manager, then asked to wait (reservations are not allowed for breakfast/brunch).  My average wait time on a weekend has been pretty close to the quoted time, which is definitely a plus on their behalf.\n\nHowever, once seated (even with empty tables all around) we were promptly greeted with water service, but then waited over 10 minutes for a waiter to offer other beverages.  Even after the beverage order, drinks were painfully slow to arrive - the waiter actually made it back to our table to take our food order before bringing our drinks.\n\nLet me reiterate that the food here is delicious, without debate.  However, I wasn't prepared to spend the entire afternoon here, regardless of the beautiful weather and our outside seating.  It took over 45 minutes for 4 brunch items, one of which was a fruit plate, and none of which required pre-ordering or long cooking times (ie. well done meats or souffles).\n\nDuring our wait, we had to ask for everything we needed, except for water refills & the bussers were very attentive.  However, the server had to constantly be flagged down or requested through the busser, as he stood idly around the corner completely oblivious to what was happening at our table.  He ignored the need for:  rounds of cocktails, missing silverware/linens, plates for sharing (after being asked twice), and our second food order (of which we had also made mention).\n\nFor such a highly regarded restaurant and world-renown chef, it would seem likely that with all of the out-of-work professional waiters vying for a job, that Thomas Keller would be able to hire someone slightly more competent.\n\nAs a local, food quality is important, but so is value - especially if I am expected to trek to the strip and brave the crowds of tourists and labyrinth parking garage.  Value for me includes service.  Perhaps we would have had a better experience with any other server, but this particular experience really tainted my ability to give an otherwise above average restaurant more than 2.5 stars."

He said his favorites were coffee or pistachio so I got a coffee macaron and a madeleine.  I've bought a little bag of madeleines at Jean Philippe Patisserie before and they were very dry and awful.  I was very disappointed with them but Bouchon's madeleine was moist and good as it should be.  \n\nFinally I had a bite of macaron...  Oooohh Mmmmyyy Goooood, it was soooo gooooood!!!!!  My sister said there is this bakery shop near her work which sells macarons and they were so good, she always thought to bring some for me but they were so delicate, she never did.  She got chocolate and raspberry.  Chocolate one was good but I thought coffee was a bit better and the raspberry one was not too sweet not too tangy, simply delicious!  She said those macarons are even better than her favorite place.  They were probably one of the best thing I've eaten for a long time and I'm talking about a dessert.  Crazy good! \n\nBefore we left Vegas, we stopped there again and had some more for us on the road and few more for my pet sitter.  I've asked them to put a few in a box and they told me they have a box of each flavor (total of six) for price of five so I've got that.  \n\nThose macarons must have something in it like we call Pinkberry, \"Crackberry\"...

Chocolate covered pistachio macarons WHAT WHAT? I ate half of it when I got it and then the other half much later that night drunk while laying on my side (AKA \"Hasselhoffing it\"- it was delicious both ways.) I also have a weakness for fancy bakery versions of Oreos and the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo) delivered! Super dark barely sweet chocolate cookie with delicious ganache inside, mmmm. I also got a cheese danish to eat later and it was delicious even though it was all crushed in my bag for a couple days. I ended up eating it at the airport waiting for my delayed flight and I was so tired and miserable I ate that thing like a beast with no napkin and no shame, the guy next to me had to be disgusted. It wasn't your regular danish (which is flat) but tall like a roll FULL OF DELICIOUS CHEESE with a little bit of lemon flavor and delicious flaky crustiness. My friend loaded up on strawberry croissants to eat and take home to her husband so if you don't hate strawberry (like me!) then those are apparently a must try item as well."

Good luck finding it - the Venetian is a maze. Even with a directory and asking folks who appeared to work at the hotel, it took a very, very long time. Pastry is your reward at the end of the line.  \n\nWhen faced with a case full of buttery, flakey, goodness - I froze. What should I get? It was all overwhelming. Suffice to say that I walked out of there with a box of macaroons and a rather large box full of goodies. \n\nThe macarons were packed well for travel so they went right into my carry-on bag. They were larger than what I typically see in Seattle. Win! They were also very well done with flavors that range from chocolate to pistachio to salted caramel. Kouign amann is at the top of my list since my friend introduced me to it years ago. This did not disappoint. A hard, sweet exterior surrounds buttery, velvety goodness inside. This is enough to ruin you forever! The croissants were very large and flakey. The pan au chocolate was very well done with the signature chocolate surrounded by croissant dough. Everything else is a blur. I'm fairly certain I bit everything in the box without regard to folks I was sharing with. \n\nOverall, a very good bakery that's very hard to find.

You might wonder where the ovens are when you first witness this pretty standard-looking mall stand flogging high-end pastries. However, disappointment subsides when actually eating said pastries. Taken aback by the nearly four dollar asking price for their plain croissants, I chipped in an extra quarter for the almond version and did not regret it. My wife's ham sandwich was also quite good. The coffee wasn't great, but it was better than the strange brew that passes at most places around the Strip. You might have guessed from my review that the bakery is pricey, but it's not outrageously so, once you consider the location."

Maybe my review isn't worth much since I don't have anything else to compare to, but my husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed a box of macarons! We were just going to get 4, but the guy said when you buy 5 you get 1 free! And I'm a sucker for things like that... :)\n\nGot 2 pistachio (because I read how fabulous they are), 1 chocolate, 1 raspberry, 1 espresso, and 1 vanilla bean. Pistachio was definitely our favorite. But they were all really really good. All of them had a light, fluffiness about them w/ that perfectly delicate outside. I loved that they were nice and puffy and none of them were too sweet. If I had to pick, vanilla was probably our least favorite, but that's only if someone made me pick. I was a bit sad when a couple of them broke because the box wasn't full and they were rolling around in the car (still in the box of course), but they were still yum. A couple of them seemed a tad dry, but I think that's also because it was a day later and we were in the car many hours (driving back home). Overall, I will DEFINITELY be coming back. :) :) :)"

            "review": "Unfortunately Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian was a huge disappointment.\nIt began with trying to find the small counter located in a most obscure location within the massive property of the Venetian Hotel.  I felt so frustrated by the time we finally arrived and made a comment about the location to one of the many employees behind the counter.  The young lady looked at me and shrugged her shoulders.  She couldn't have cared less.  Remember?  This is a Thomas Keller experience and I guess I should have remembered that part.  Once I made my selections I was passed over to the cashier, or was it one of the many other people behind the counter (they were literally bumping into one another because there were so many people behind the counter) where I repeated my order to her and cashed out.  I had selected the ham and cheese on a baguette that was heated up for me and was good.  No complaints.  The bread was fresh and because it was heated had a nice crunch to it.  I had also ordered several other products for the sake of this review and because having recently returned from a 3 month stay in France wanted to have the opportunity to make a fair comparison.  Keep in mind my selections (with the exception of the TKO) are standard faire anywhere in France so in my mind the right selections for the sake of comparison.\nThe almond croissant was so heavy (weight).  As soon as I picked it up I knew it was nowhere close to an almond croissant one would find anywhere in France or any Stateside French bakery.  It was FILLED with almond paste and there was no flakiness whatsoever to the pastry.  I took a couple of bites and tossed it.  I pulled the Financier from the bag and took a couple of bites of it and it too was just a big heavy something or other.\nI am not trying to sound like a snob but I have come to realize there are \"American\" French (sounds good) Bakeries and there are French Bakeries.  This is definitely an American style French Bakery.  The products are heavy, way too big in size and lack any \"French\" to them.  \nSo to wrap it up, I thought the employees made me feel like I was lucky to be at a Thomas Keller establishment.  The location (or secret hiding place) of this particular \"kiosk\" or \"counter\" was ridiculous.  And finally it is not a French Bakery but a bakery where you can pick up something that resembles a bakery item you would find in France or most French Bakeries Stateside.\nSorry Thomas...just sayin'..."

I got an iced mocha, better nutter cookie, TKO cookie, and one of the plain baguettes for about $17. That's cheap even if not on the strip. The cookies are huge.\n\nIced Mocha - rich with quality cocoa powder. The best mocha I've ever tasted. Has notes of coconut from the rich cocoa powder. Get it! \n\nMacarons - best macarons IMO. They are big too. No hollow shell like some places. Perfectly soft with the nice macaron shell crust. Not chew like some places, although I'm not against the chewy type macarons. These macarons melt in your mouth.\n\nCupcakes - I saw a giant cupcake for $3.25. They are in between the jumbo muffin and regular sized muffin cups. I've never tried any of their cupcakes, but they look really good. $3.25 for a cupcake is a steal these days considering Sprinkles at the Linq charges somewhere around $4 I think.\n\nBetter Nutter cookie - GET IT. Even if you don't like peanut butter. This is like a peanut butter lover's dream come true. My mom isn't fond of peanut butter but she is absolutely obsessed with this. The cookie has bits of peanuts in it as well as peanut butter I believe, the cream filling is a peanut butter italian meringue buttercream. OMG, it's soooooo good.\n\nTKO cookie - chocolate butter cookie with white chocolate ganache filling.  Meh, it was okay. I wish the filling had some vanilla flavor, but it was really just cocoa butter flavor and cream. I think vanilla would've helped the flavor shine a bit more. The cookie is also really soft. It was hard to break pieces off. But hey, that means you don't have to share. The chocolate cookie itself was good and not sweet. It balanced the sweetness of the filling nicely.\n\nBread - it's their standard baguette they serve at dinner in their restaurant. They toast it up for you if you want and ask you if you want jam or cream cheese. The bread does get hard after it cools down, so better eat it while it's warm. Nice crust and chewy. Great aroma.\n\nAmericano - the first place I've ordered an americano that tastes creamy without anything but espresso + water. I don't know how they managed to do that. If you need a dairy-free option, get the Americano."

Each bite explodes of flavor, I'll leave that to you to think about.\n\nWhat they dropped the ball on the bread pudding. Way too much raisins jammed into the  overly dry pastry that you end up building a pile of raisins as you rip through pieces of the bread pudding. Mind you, we got out pastries at 9am. \n\nAnother note that if you order any type of drinks here on top of the pastry, you pay for everything, get the pastries up front...but the procedure on how you get your drink is idiotic. That definitely needs to be improved because not noting what they just made or even a name to a particular drinks= many pissed off faces standing by a counter that only lets one person get to it to get a drink.

So when the GF's family and I were in Vegas, I knew I had to bring them by Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian.\n\nPro-Tip: If it's your first time, you will get lost trying to find this small outpost so make sure you leave enough time if you've got other events on the agenda! After asking 4 different staff members and getting 4 different answers for two different floors, I ultimately lucked my way unto the Bakery. If you're walking towards the guest elevators, do NOT go up them. Instead, you'll find Bouchon Bakery literally behind the escalators.\n\nPistachio Macaron [$3.50]\n\nI started off with a few macarons. Perfectly textured with a nice chew, the pistachio imparted a slightly nutty flavor which was nice. \n\nSalted Caramel Macaron [$3.50]\n\nYou can't go wrong with the salted caramel, which had great depth and richness. \n\nBetter Nutter [$3.25]\n\nThe better nutter was better than your average Nutter Butter indeed. Within crisply thin cookies was a gorgeously creamy and light peanut butter that wasn't too intense. Pass the milk please! \n\nTKO [$3.25]\n\nBut really we were here for the TKO. Better than your average Oreo, the juxtaposition of the creme and the bitter chocolate notes from the cookies brought me back to childhood indeed. \n\nThe pricing is admittedly a bit high, but you're paying for technique and precision from the pastry kitchen of Thomas Keller, one of America's notable chefs. So if you've got a sweet tooth and need to satiate that craving, head on over to Bouchon Bakery - if you can find it!"

After being mislead a few times and wandering around aimlessly on the casino floor, we finally found it. I guess it didn't help that I was smashed from my Fat Tuesday's drink, but that's another story...\n\nThe traditional croissant met all my expectations for everything I love about these buttery little bastards: flaky crust on the outside, soft and airy on the inside. Well done.\n\nOne bite of my friend's strawberry croissant and I was hooked. Incredibly moist, sweet without feeling like you'll develop a cavity. I also had a taste of the chocolate macaron, which was very rich and decadent. It felt so sinful!\n\nSo-so with the s'more cheesecake. The textures were off, in my opinion. The chocolate was chunky and hard, would've been much better smooth like the cream filling. The marshmallow was difficult to eat. And the butter in the graham cracker crust overpowered the other flavors. \n\nThe next day I returned and got some bread that resembled foccacia. It was so soft like a pillow. \n\nThe only awkward thing that happened was that I forgot my green tea at the barista counter. Realizing this 10 minutes later, I returned and it was still there. I wanted to make sure that it was mine, so I asked the workers. They just gave me blank stares."

I have been coming here for years, but I am extremely sad to report that my last two visits have revealed that they just don't care any more. \n\nThey seem content to just coast on their laurels selling this stuff to rubes and foreigners \n\nThe coffee is good, but the pastry is where they need to re-focus.  \n\nFirst, the biggest offender is their Macarons. They served us a nasty hateful hard lump of a cookie last week. This thing was seriously rock hard. They are supposed to be crispy with a slightly softer interior.  That is the WHOLE POINT of the cookie.  When we complained they said \"that is the way they are supposed to be, and the softer ones are old\" No, no, they are not. You overcooked the crap out of these which formed, essentially, a meringue. \n I have eaten Macrons across the world and made them myself. I was in Paris a few month ago and took down a half dozen of these from Laduree. I am pretty familiar with this stupid little cookie because my wife loves them. \n\nDo not insult me by telling me this hammer-substitute is in any way acceptable. They told us to take it up with the downstairs location if we did not like it and refused to refund or exchange the cookie.  Astounding. \n\nThe rest of the menu items have just gone downhill. Their croissants are all but indistinguishable from the stuff they sling at buffets.  The outside should be flakey and the inside tender. Not some glupey congealed mess. You know how I know its a terrible croissant? There was absolutely no flakes to clean up. \n\nI hope Dominique Ansel opens a location and shows you guys whats up."

The macarons are good but I wish they would make them half the size and half the price so I could eat more flavors. I like to try different flavors but I don't think I can eat more than one without getting sick.  Plus if you don't like a flavor (I didn't like the chocolate) then you feel guilty about throwing away a $4 macaron. I'm a dark chocolate lover, but the flavor just seemed way too intense for a macaron. I also tried...\n\nBlueberry Financier - ehh, it's ok, but the plain almond one was way better. Too bad they don't have it right now. \n\nApple Croissant - Amazing, esp if you love apple crisp or Dutch apple pie. Make sure they toast it for you on the panini press.\n\nAlmond Chocolate Croissant. - It's pretty good, but the chocolate dominated the hell out of the marzipan, their regular almond croissant is better, but they don't have it there now.\n\nBouchons - INSANELY DELICIOUS. I always buy a package of 6 for $10 and take them home and bake them in my toaster oven for a couple minutes. They get kind of crisp on the outside and very soft and melty inside. They are very high in fat, so I put a wad of paper towel under when I bake them. It's always soaked with grease so I figure I can eat more because I am sparing myself a lot of fat grams, lol!\n\nI'm dying to try their HoHo or choc tart next time\n\nOh and for the CUPCAKE lovers, get your Red Velvet Cupcake to go from the restaurant, for some reason it was waaaay better than the one in the bakery case."

The French baguette is crusty and delicious, the cheese is nice and melty...perfect!\nSmoked salmon sandwich: Perfectly smoked salmon, piled generously on a Kaiser roll, with sweet pickled onions and watercress.\nOh Oh: Keller's take on a Ho. Unbelievable. Perfectly soft chocolate sponge cake rolled with whipped cream, dipped in chocolate ganache that isn't too hard or too sweet, with a sprinkling of chocolate crisps on top. Our Oh Oh had four chocolate crips. When my husband handed my the Oh Oh to take a bite, it was upside down, and I unintentionally consumed all four of the crisps he had been eating around to save. Oops.\nBetter Nutter: Two crisp peanut butter cookies filled with peanut butter mousse. Slight sweet, perfectly salty, incredibly delicious. \nKouign Amann: Flaky, buttery, not too sweet.

(Why bother having the bouchon trademark and serve stale goods?) \nTalked with girl who sold us pastries - after some discussion she refunded the order (at least there was that). So let's start with what was wrong. \n(-1) For having the dryest butter croissant. It looked soo good and flaky. But darn can looks be deceiving. \n(-1) For having the morning sticky bun that was made two mornings ago. They claimed these were baked fresh... but i've made sticky buns myself and they didn't taste that stale (the butter in the caramel had almost a rancid taste) even after days in the fridge. \n(-1) For macaron that was frozen, not properly thawed, and then produced to ice while still being ice-cold. The worker claimed they were \"Refrigerated\". Unless in the cooking world -8C is refrigeration, something is wrong. \n(+1) For the kind soul that refunded us the money. She seemed so lost and claimed thats how everything is \"supposed to taste\". Not sure if that's better or worse. \n\n Anywho: I dont even want to give them a second shot. #sadness."

The macarons were pricey, about $3 for one, so I only bought the raspberry one. However, it was one of my favorite macarons ever. I liked the cream filling in the middle, opposed to the jelly filling that most other restaurants will have in their raspberry macarons. I also got a s'mores cupcake, and it was only above average. It wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be, but the cake part was fluffy and moist. The last thing I got was a chocolate croissant. It was flaky and buttery. I really liked it, but just wished it had a little more chocolate in the middle."

Everything here is just so cute and looks yummy. A little on the pricey side, but the Turkey Baguette sandwich with a chocolate eclair has got me hooked. \n\nI dunno what the hell is in that turkey baguette, so addicting.. They have it prepared in a glass window and once you order it they put it in a panini press-like machine to heat it up. The baguette has some leafy greens, lots of fresh turkey, a creamy/nutty/buttery cheese that is to die for, and a special spreAd that brings everything together. Also, the baguette itself is soft & crunchy with nuts baked in. Like Bobby Flay said, the best foods are the simple ones done right. \n\nPricey for sure but the Turkey baguette ($9)  is heartier than it looks!"

However, this is what I have tried:\n\n1. Strawberry croissant...AWESOME. Fresh made strawberry jam inside a buttery, flaky croissant that's dusted with confectioner's sugar.. Not TOO sweet IMO and OH SO enjoyable.\n\n2. Chocoloate Bouchon...Imagine the best brownie you ever ate, but more moist and less dense; then add some semi sweet chocolate chips in the middle, dust it off with some confectioner's sugar and you have a chocolate Bouchon. They clearly used a very high quality dark chocolate, could be a Valrhona 60%+ dark baking chocolate. Who knows? But I do know that I will be buying more of these bit sized treats.\n\n3. Almond Brioche...The edges have a slightly stale and burnt taste to them. While some may prefer this texture and flavor combination, I did not. After discarding the edges, I was left with an amazing piece of soft and moist brioche bread with a wonderful almond paste and sliced almonds. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\n4. Pretzel sticks...Personally, I love pretzels and pretzel bread. So while this was nothing special, I still enjoyed it quite a bit. If I could take it home and heat it up in the oven and dip it in some great mustard or cheese dip...then it would be GREAT!\n\nThere are still many things I plan to try soon, will update this as I try them."

It was close, on the way out to the airport and we assumed it would probably kick the crap out of any airport food you could get.  \n\nHere's what we sampled:\n\nTurkey Brie Sandwich: Brie, lettuce, roast turkey, and mustard.\n\nWarmed and pressed, the bread had a texture of a ciabatta which was good, the creaminess of the brie got a little sticky and runny in the sandwich after heating it, and I liked the aroma and texture of melted brie in any way shape or form.  Still, I have to admit, this didn't outstanding, it was good, but the taste wasn't any different from a sandwich that I could have made myself.\n\nVegetable jardiniere Sandwich: With Portabello mushroom, eggplant, fennel, caramelized onions, picquillo pepper, fontina cheese and pesto.\n\nMy g/f ordered this.  Oh my goodness.  This is the sandwich I SHOULD have ordered from the start.  It is a vegetarian sandwich, but the meatiness of the mushrooms, the texture of the eggplant, with the aromatics and crisp bite from the fennel.  Each bite was almost a unique cathartic experience, you had a mixture of caramelized onions, the mellow heat and body from the pepper and the melted fontina cheese was able the sit carefully on the knife edge on being flavorful and robust but also remained delicate enough it didn't overpower the sandwich.  Seriously, my g/f loved this sandwich so much, it was almost impossible for me to get additional bites, I even offered her a trade on our sandwiches, where she simply smiled at me and continued eating.  This was a fantastic sandwich that even me; a devote carnivore, feel as though this was a sandwich that I would be happy to eat on a regular basis. \n\nChocolate bouchons:  \n\nTheir name was given due to the fact that they are shaped like the corks from bottle of wine.  Without a doubt they certainly taste better then the real corks, these little morsels were rich and super moist, with little chocolate bits inside.  It reminds me of a brownie, a damn good one at that.\n\nChocolate Eclair:  \n\nThis was my dessert, me being the chocoholic after first glance when I saw it in the glass enclosure, I didn't stand a chance.  The choux pastry dough, was light and airy, carried a light and subtle sweetness, additionally the chocolate creme patissiere was decadent and smooth, and there was a rich slathering of more chocolate right on top, creating a lovely balance with each intoxicating mouthful.  \n\nLemon Tart:  \n\nMy g/f's choice, and quite honestly she has bested me once again, in terms of picking the item I would get again, the lemon filling almost reminded me of a lemon curd; with all the zest that they put in you could really taste the fresh lemons, the wonderful level of acidity balanced with a creamy richness.  Most notably, is the crust, here rather then to just do a pie crust or a simple graham cracker crust, they went with a fresh pine nut crust, the pine nuts created a great aroma, nutty texture with a crisp crunch.  With each bite of the two elements, with their contrasting flavors, and textures melded together creating a absolutely amazing dish.  It's a must try for those that have yet to experience this, and one I'll be getting next time.\n\nParisian Macaroons\n\nAppearance wise these were stunning, I bought a couple of boxes to take back home as gifts, and even though up front they ran out, the staff were kind enough to go into the back room and make the rest to complete our order.  Wonderful presentation and colors, I was told that they each had different flavors, (which included lemon, orange, strawberry, vanilla, mocha and chocolate.)  Basically, we had a delay and ultimately a cancelled flight so me and my g/f may have dug into one of the boxes, you know we had to sample the gift we were giving and we did want to make sure the gift we were about to give was fresh since our next flight would be the next day.  So we sampled a box.  Rich, chewy and super dense, with a wonderful flavor sandwiched with a very thin layer of creme.  If I had to rate it in the order of preference, it went vanilla, coffee, lemon, chocolate, strawberry and orange.  Goes really well with a nice cup of plain coffee as well!\n\nThe next day on our way back for attempt #2 to the airport, we stopped by one more time here and replenished the macaroons gift box that we consumed while taste testing it.  So make sure next time your here go ahead and give into whatever pastries and sweets you desire just make sure don't leave without trying the lemon tart and the Vegetable jardiniere!"

My family and I have been to Bouchon Bakery in Yountville California many many times, and this Las Vegas location is inferior. We are not quite sure why they aren't keeping up with quality control, but after going out of our way to get pastries there on our one day in Vegas, we felt obligated to write a review. \n\nWe had butter croissants and almond croissants, and they were all stale and awful. They seemed to be day old at least. We have not only been to Bouchon Bakery many times in California, but we have also eaten at Bouchon Bistro in Yountville for various special occasions. We have never been disappointed there, and have always loved our meals.\nPerhaps the Bouchon Bakery in Vegas is under different ownership?"

            "review": "http://thesoloreviewer.blogspot.com/\n\nA trip to Las Vegas isn't complete without several trips to Bouchon Bakery. I stayed at the Venetian Hotel and Casino for one major reason. Thomas freaking Keller! Whether I was dining at Bouchon Bistro or snacking on treats from Bouchon Bakery, I followed Keller like a fly on a horse's butt! First trip consisted of one of there famous macaroons which I didn't see what the fuss was. I got the vanilla flavor but maybe they only taste good when they first bring them down because mine was a little on the stale side. While the vanilla cream inside was good the stale outside just ruined it. \n\nSecond trip was a little more successful. I ended with the famous Thomas Keller's version of a Nutter Butter and a freshly baked Chocolate Donut with a custard filling. The Nutter Butter was good, much better than the cookie, with a peanut butter cookie on the outside and delicious peanut butter on the inside making it a perfect little treat! Move over Dunkin Donuts because I run on Thomas Keller's Donuts. Perfectly shaped donut with a wonderful custard feeling with chocolate icing and chocolate sprinkles on top. MMMMMM Donut was the only thing that kept popping in my head while eating it! If I had a Bouchon Bakery near me I would be the size of a whale. \n\nThird trip was my favorite. I got the Carrot Cake Cookie. It tasted so fresh and moist and looks just like that big cookie in the movie \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\" that the ants were eating on. Hopefully ya'll know what I'm talking about. Just like the ants I couldn't get enough. It had that nice little spice that carrot cake has with a wonderful cream inside that reminded me of the cream in those oatmeal cookies I got growing up in my school lunches. Just a perfect cookie!\n\nLast and final trip, a tear slowly ran down my eyes while I made my final purchase, was Red Velvet Cupcake with a Citrus Frosting. While cheesecake is my favorite desert, red velvet is my second and this cupcake is the reason why. I got it as soon as they came down from baking, it was perfectly moist with a wonderfully rich cream cheese feeling inside a nice citrus frosting on top with a cute little smiley face made of chocolate chips reminding me it was Halloween. It was very rich but very good!\n\nAll I can say is thank you Thomas Keller for being the genius you are and making my trip oh so sweet!"

When asking about the macaron flavors, I was told that I had the choice between vanilla, lemon, raspberry, and chocolate. I chose vanilla and chocolate, after the girl helping me told me that the vanilla she picked up was a different color because it was prepared today and the others were not.\n\nGreat, I thought.

Having had Bouchon macarons before, I thought it would be worth it to drive to the Venetian hotel, park and walk through the casino for this tasty little treat.  I had a friend in town on a short layover and had told her how these were the best tasting macarons I had ever had, including our many trips to Paris.  Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE. At $3.50 per cookie, I expected them to be super fresh and melting in my mouth. They were not moist, but completely dry and old tasting. Two stars because the chai latte was decent."

In my opinion, macarons should be a bit smaller unless you're absolutely sure you can get them right. The ratio of cookie to filling was too high, which made them a bit dry. The mint choc chip was decently flavored, but it reminded me a bit of toothpaste. The cookie was a bit too mushy. The passion fruit was a disaster. The filling tasted like buttery egg, and it was only very very slightly passionfruity. \n\nAll in all, these are low on the list of macarons for me, and they were also the most expensive by volume. Save your money and try something else, if you fancy yourself a true macaron lover."

The location of it is a blessing and a curse: it's right at the base of the guest elevators, so it makes it easy to get to in the morning... but that also makes it crowded. Luckily, my husband and I were able to get in line before a group of 30 people descended on the place. I felt bad for the people behind them, they were going to have a very long wait!"

The coffee here was warm and delicious too, not too bold. Finally, the macaroons - sweet like soft candy. The coffee flavor macaroon was my favorite!

The bakery doesn't provide a sitting area, but it's a great place for a quick grab and go. Showcasing countless selections of morning pastries and snacks, it was difficult choosing only a limited few. Between the 3 of us, we walked away with a slice of pesto, tomato, & feta foccacia bread, pistachio macaron, pear & apricot glazed bread pudding, strawberry croissant, mini chocolate bouchons, and a box of half dozen macarons for the flight home. $48 for everything was a major rapage, but well worth it.\n\nThe pesto foccacia was very moist and flavorful, but a bit on the greasy side. Appropriate to indulge if you need to recover from a nasty hangover. Bread pudding was a major surprise, but the richness and density in each bite was overwhelmingly filling. I wish I could have stomached more, but at least my left overs lasted 2 days later and still tasted just as amazing. \n\nFor the box of macarons, we had pistachio, raspberry, vanilla bean, lemon, mocha, & chocolate. Favorites listed that order as well. The texture is much more dense than what I'm used to, but the cream filling won me over. Not sure how many of these babies I can devour over a cup of coffee, but they're certainly a delectable treat. I'm curious to try the beignets and lemon tart during my next visit.\n\nThe bakery is hidden right next to the Phantom Theater. Again, no seating available, so take your treats upstairs and hang out at the Coffee Bean."

Thier chocolate croissant has just enough chocolate inside (2 little sticks) - not drenched in chocolate like the ones from starbucks. I also got thier raison croissant. It looks like a figure 8, like 2 cinnamon rolls stuck together. Not too sweet, and again, crunch on the outside, soft on the inside. Its one of thier more popular pastries, and I had to get it since it was the last one left. Macarons were to DIE for. They are bigger and thinner than your average size. I didn't think they looked very special but after I got one taste. I literally said \"wow\". The girl behind the registered laughed at me. All thier baked goods are around $4 dollars. More than your average price, but definately worth it!\n\nThier baguette sandwiches are also really good. They are a bit pricey.. but whats new in Vegas? :) ~$11 for a sandwich. 3 different kinds: the roast beef, ham/cheese, and turkey. I got the turkey. The bread have these huge walnuts. The spread has a garlic kick to it. And the cheese was very flavorful. The bread was very dense and crunchy. You can get a toasted, and the sandwich turns kind of into a panini. Ive had it both ways, and loved it :)\n\nI would go back to vegas, just to get bouchons :)"

Jean Philippe sould be ashamed of themselves for even advertising the fact that the sell macarons. All they had was a puny 6 tiny macarons (size of a quarter) for $10.. Same thing with Payard. As much as they advertise they sell them- shame on them too. They didn't have any macarons except for puny little pre-packaged ones that were way overpriced..\n\nAll i can say, when it comes to getting real French Macarons in Vegas- the place to go to is Boucheron.

I I wasn't expecting that, but I guess if I actually read the description that the bakery provided for their customers, I would have have expecting it, but all I say when I was looking in the bakery case was CUPCAKE!

I've found a couple places that I love, a few that I like, and a ton that were just not good. I was delighted to find a small Bouchon Bakery stand in the Venetian when I was in Vegas last. I saw a ton of macarons and I knew I just had to try them.\n\nMACARONS.\nHmm... well, I've had better. Collectively, the macarons were just okay. Individually, some were better than others. I went to Bouchon thirty minutes before they closed and realized they didn't have many macarons left in the display. I asked if they had more in the back, and the girl working there said they do but they're in a set of six. I thought to myself, this was perfect! I wanted to try a bunch of flavors anyway. So I ended up paying around $20 for six macarons. Crazy right?! Usually I pay around $25 for a dozen. But hey, when in Vegas. \nI noticed immediately after my first bite that the macarons that were pre boxed were not very fresh. I could tell because the macaron completely crumbled after one bite, which is usually because they've old. Fresh macarons (24-48 hours) are typically crisp on the outside but are chewy on the inside. Though the outside shell can be crumbly, the whole thing shouldn't just collapse. The macarons were either old or they weren't made properly.\nRegardless, I tried every flavor. My favorites were the chocolate, coffee and vanilla. The chocolate was filled with a rich chocolate ganache. The coffee was strong but in a good way, the way it should be in a macaron. The vanilla was light and it cleansed my palette after the strong (delicious) coffee macaron I had just before it. The strawberry tasted funky to me... kind of like a flower. I don't know how to describe it, but I didn't like it. I find strawberry macarons are a bit tricky to get right, not unless you use fresh strawberry in the filling. The artificial flavors just don't cut it with this delicate french pastry. The pistachio was horrid... it was strong in flavor and was just too much for me to finish. I'm not a fan of pistachio, so maybe that's why. But if you love pistachio, you'll probably really enjoy this one!\n\nPRICE.\nAbout $20 for a box of 6 macarons is quite expensive. I realize this is Vegas and Bouchon Bakery is expensive, but dangggg! I think next time I'll come earlier in the day, make my own customized box of macarons, and call it a day. I'd be more satisfied with a box full of flavors I really like.\n\nOVERALL. Okay macarons, in my opinion. The price is way too much for what you actually get. I'm no cheapskate, but I know how much an 'okay' macaron should cost, and how much a GREAT should macaron cost. I paid too much for 'okay' macarons."

The hint of raspberry flavor goes well with the chocolate.\n\nI also got the Apple Croissant ($3.75), a butter croissant with thinly sliced apples and baked almond cream filling, topped with almond streusel. Huge thumbs up here. Velvety filling, flaky pastry. Not too sweet. Basically, it just kicks ass -- and I got way more bang for my buck here than with the macaron.\n\nFrankly, the price is really the only thing that would prevent me from just dashing right back and ordering one of everything in the display case. A fine example of how one must pay for quality. Plus, it's located on the Strip, so it'll automatically be hella expensive.\n\nThe person at the counter tried to sell me on getting some cookies as well. Not this time, but who knows. I could end up getting a cookie bender in Vegas one day.\n\nAt the end of the day, I thought Bouchon Bakery was worth the stop!"

And so since the Bouchon Bakery was just near the lifts to the rooms, I thought I'd nip right downstairs for a quick pastry and hot tea for myself and my friend. Oh boy, it was 9am and there was already a long line waiting to place orders. Thank goodness they have a system of taking orders while you're in line so that you get your order and pay for it by the time you get to the cashier around the corner. \n\nUnfortunately, as I found out, when you place your order from around the corner, unless you already know what's being displayed at the front of the counter, you will only have seen the several awesomely delicious looking pastries on display......and likely have missed everything else at the front counter display around the corner. There were a few more items such as cookies, breakfast croissant and French baguette sandwiches, yoghurt, mixed fruit cups, etc. Yea, I could've added the items to my order, but it was so busy and I didn't want to get dirty looks from the customers in line behind me....plus everybody behind he counter was so busy that I didn't want to bother them......plus, I had already ordered more than enough. \n\nI ordered one raisin danish (ok, they called it something raisin in French, but I forget the name and spelling) and a blueberry muffin. Yes, they were both totally fresh and yummy! However, the raisin pastry I thought was a bit thin so you don't get the full usual fluffiness of the inside.....the outer crisp was nice and light though. The blueberry muffin was very good too....and both not as sweet as I thought they'd be, which I was glad about."

I fell in love with your $3.25 goodness. The chocolate chip cookie was a tad brittle, but the buttery fluffiness of the croissant and pain au raisin helped numb the pain in my teeth. \n\nIf only your prices were a tad lower (why is it cheaper in Yountville of all places?), I would love you forever. \n\nBouchon does wonders with butter."

I love the sweet, creamy filling but their flavors were not very exciting - vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, salted caramel,  raspberry. How about matcha tea? Blueberry? Black Sesame?

To me, that's like sending a fat kid to a candy store and telling her to go at it.  I love croissants.  I love good coffee.  If I could marry them, I would. \n\nBeing from Portland and somewhat of a coffee snob , I was really impressed with my foamy and rich latte on the first day...I had to ask who supplies their beans.  Bouchon Bakery had a really good espresso blend that is custom blended by Illy for them.  Their lattes really hit the spot in a city where it seems alcohol is consumed in larger quantities than water.  I couldn't wait to get up and hit this bakery almost every morning during our stay here.  Once I was even asked by the cashier if I worked at the hotel because she had been seeing me around a lot. \n\nTheir selection was all so drool-inducing but could easily leave a large gaping hole in your pocket.  Not to worry, the sticker shock will leave you momentarily in a daze until you realize yes, you are on vacation and YES...it is WORTH IT.  Their buttery, flaky croissants are excellent with jam on the side. Not to mention their red velvet cupcakes that were really moist and topped with soft sweet delicious frosting.  They definitely have all the red velvet cupcakes sold in my hometown BEAT.  These things are so popular they do sell out, so be sure to make your way here early enough in the day.\n\nMy only regret is not going more often and trying out the macaroons but I am sure I will be back on my next trip to sin city.

These varieties may be daubed generously with supple sensuous buttercream--never overly-sweet.  \n\nBouchon has the latter sort.  I tried Black Forest, coffee, salted caramel, chocolate covered pistachio, and pumpkin.   All amazing, some more or less so.   I also destroy---er, I mean I ate a better nutter and a tko (aka Thomas Keller Oreo).  The two sandwich cookies were deliriously delicious.  Like a transcendental experience.   Full body bliss.  No joke.  Not too sweet.  Flavors were coaxed through due to the lack of molar cracking saccharinity).  Soft silky moist filled with shots of sensuously sweet butter cream. \n\nSo good I'm gonna spring for the cookbook and attempt to tame Mr Keller in my own kitchen."

These are about the size of my fist, and yes at $3+ may seem expensive, but think about the value. The smaller macarons cost around $1.25 - $2 at other places! At Bouchon Bakery, you can also get a package of 6 for $17.50 I believe, which is well worth the money. My favorite flavors are Pistachio and Chocolate. These even lasted a 4 hour car ride back to SoCal - although they were a little melted, they were still delicious. Bouchon macarons are my must haves when I'm in Vegas."

These macarons were probably the best I'd ever had in my lifetime. Each cookie was the right sweet, flavor distinct, slight crunch, and nice texture. I took very small bites to prolong the experience and hoping it wouldn't end. I could easily eat through the $20 worth. I also had the croissant, some cookie sandwich, and a turkey cran baguette. All were pretty good and made the experience great.\n\nAlso, bouchon bakery is probably the best spot to get coffee in the hotel. The ratio of girls to guys in line is 5 to 1. That's pretty good odds for Vegas. \n\nuploaded pic - \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=3cSaRAN4ukyF0ch8BrAN7w#3cSaRAN4ukyF0ch8BrAN7w"

After Payard, we did some browsing, and some of the ladies went shopping. A few hours later, my friend Izzy and I were separated from the group when we were heading towards the Venetian. The reason for that was some dude pulled us aside trying to offer us wrist bands to get into clubs, and all he asked for was a tip. Since we didn't live in Las Vegas, we weren't sure if this dude was legitimate, so we walked away from it. We were trying to look for the rest of the girls, but then decided that we should meet near the canal shops where the gondolas were passing (instead of Bouchon Bakery). \n\nSo Izzy was leading the way over to the bakery. After walking a good 5 minutes from the entrance, we arrived. Bouchon Bakery can be easily passed by because it is under an escalator, across from the Bouchon restaurant. I came to the bakery solely because of the macarons, which Izzy said were pretty good. So I bought one of each flavor and there were seven of them. They were $3.50 each and totaled to $24.50. The price of those bad boys were steep, but I forked over the money just so I could taste them. I ate the chocolate one and the cinnamon one, and they were both delicious. I shared the rest of the macarons with the rest of the girls when we met up at the canal shops, and they thoroughly enjoyed them. One of the girls, Nicole, felt bad that I spent that much on the macarons that she didn't want to eat anymore. I insisted that everyone have the rest because these macarons are sweet, and I already had my intake of sugar for the day. Because of the macarons, it prompted a few of the girls to buy some as well from the bakery. \n\nOverall, the service at the bakery was excellent, and the macarons were delicious. I popped my macaron cherry. lol..... But the cost of them I wasn't so fond of. I know there has to be a few patisseries in San Diego that make macarons!"

We asked an employee of the hotel and she directed us to a small shop upstairs foe the casino with only a small selection of desserts. We didn't mind because we were going only for the macarons. I was hesitant and couldn't believe I was spending almost 20 bucks on 6 cookies. I've never had a macaron and was nervous because what if they were gross? Luckily, these were so good!! We got vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, pumpkin, PB and jelly, and pistachio. They looked so beautiful in the box! I tried the vanilla first. I loved the texture! Soft and chewy and so good! The PB and Jelly was my absolute favorite and the chocolate was my daughters favorite. Least favorite was the pumpkin. The pistachio and vanilla tastes very similar to me but we're still delicious! So glad we finally tried this place. Unfortunately, it's located on the strip and we don't go down there often but just might have to make a special trip for another PB and Jelly! Yum!!"

Given the name that Thomas Keller has made for himself, these just HAD to be the best macarons ever, right? (Well, other than Laduree in New York, which I've not had a chance to try yet (they actually invented the macaron as we know it, I believe).\n\nSo here I am, with a 3.50 macaron. Pricey? Yes, but this is a pretty big macaron too. I bite into it. The shell gives away under your bite, cracking and retaining a delicious crunchy exterior that is ever so delicate. My girlfriend gushes about how these are texturally, the best macarons ever. And I agree. Out of all of the macarons I've tried, the crispness and delicacy of the Bouchon macaron is supreme.\n\nToo bad it doesn't taste like anything. \n\nWe got raspberry and their special flavor of the month (or week, or something?) which was strawberry lemon. I could BARELY taste the raspberry, and subsequent bites lost all flavor completely - I could taste the almond from the almond meal. And the strawberry lemon? A bit better, at least each bite tasted slightly like lemonade and not almonds. \n\nIf you're a texture hound, these are possibly the best I've had, but if you're like me, and desire macarons for the intense flavor profile that repeatedly wallops you in the face, Bouchon doesn't deliver."

I thought it was more of a sit-down cafe type of bakery. We peer into the glass case and everything looked so good. Then I saw the prices, especially for their french baguette sandwiches which looked like a skinnier version of Lee's sandwiches. It was $9.\n\nWe ended up getting a croissant and two macarons, all of which were huge in size at over $3 each. I know it's not a large sampling of what the bakery has to offer, but everything tasted just okay. For some reason, I thought the croissant would taste better than the ones from Costco (gasp!). \n\nThe macarons remind me of giant cookies, like the ones the Cookie Monster eats holding it in one hand. They were light, semi-chewy, and not overly sweet. I can't quite describe it, but the smaller sized macarons we had at Miette Patisserie in the SF Ferry Bldg tasted like it had more depth in flavors, if that's at all possible in a non-savory dessert pastry."

For some reason though, the pastries in Yountville still is the best to me. I'm not sure if it has to do with the environment and the setting, but that's just how I feel.\n\nThey always have a splendid deal of: Buy 5, get 1 free Macarons. I especially like their salted caramel, coffee, and pistachio flavors. However, their other flavors do not disappoint either. Their macarons are one of my favorites and cannot be beat - the inside is nice and creamy while the outside has a nice crunch without all the flakiness. I also have had their cookies and pastries and have not been disappointed yet. However, they aren't particularly amazing.. just all in all good."

Namely, I'm obsessed with their cupcakes (and I am not a fan of the trendy cupcake movement).\n\nMy latest visit came after a one-month, self-imposed sugar ban.  And, because I love these trendy little cakes so much, I chose to break my fast on a Bouchon chocolate cupcake!\n\nThe basis for my obsession is that the frosting will not put you into a diabetic coma.  The sweetness is doable. Further, the chocolate frosting tastes more like a mousse, less like a birthday cake.   If I wanted a cupcake that tastes like birthday cake, I'll make it myself (and you do not want to see me bake...scary).\n\nAnd, at $3.50, these are a pretty good deal -- smaller, less delicious cupcakes in Las Vegas can be had for $2.50.  The selection, however, is limited--I've only ever seen chocolate and red velvet.  Both are good.\n\nBouchon Bakery is a great way to experience Thomas Keller without dropping a few hundred at his restaurant upstairs.  I do wish they'd serve up some tables though! What is up with that!?! Come on!"

The texture is perfect as well as the outer shell is light and crunchy, the inside is soft and chewy with a beautiful chocolate center.\n\nI always get macaroons whenever I see them and this place has the best.  Further, these are almost twice as big as regular macaroons.  Always, ALWAYS get a box of 6 because you get 1 free as it helps to alleviate the price a little even though macaroons are pricey everywhere (even for small ones).\n\nI've also gotten the 3 pack of chocolate chip cookies and they were great also...good chocolate flavor and a nice texture.  The first time we tried the macaroons, we tried almost all the flavors...the other flavors were OK, but I can't recall any single flavor standing out except chocolate.  Every subsequent trip to Bouchon has consisted of only the chocolate macaroons.\n\nThe ironic part is that there is a Bouchon in Beverly Hills but we never go when we are there, it's almost as if it's a Vegas tradition for us.\n\nIn a city where desserts at buffets are rampant and way too sweet, these chocolate macaroons are the best treat around."

They serve a variety of delicious cookies, cupcakes, and pastries as well as coffees & other hot drinks.  The stuff they have is delicious.  Definitely try their almond croissant and their chocolate croissant.  Their chocolate croissant even beats Jean Phillipe (at the Bellagio).  If you've got an insane sweet tooth, then try the apple croissant.  I wouldn't suggest that one for breakfast though b/c it was way too sweet for my liking. \n\n2) BOUCHON RESTAURANT - 10th floor of the Venetian \nSo like everywhere in the Vegas hotels, you take a convoluted route before you can actually find your final destination because everything here is so big.  However, this restaurant was well worth the convoluted trip.  There is a huge variety of brunch options including quiches, pastries, eggs, etc.  I like that they can do your eggs *any* style and they mean it - including scrambled egg whites - my favourite.  I also ADORED their chocolate croissant - it was seriously delicious.  They have that downstairs at the bakery too.  \n\nSo overall, a great find and definitely worth going again!"

You'll find a couple of locations scattered around.  There are two (one upstairs, one downstairs) up on the north end where there's a raised walkway across the strip to TI & Mirage.  I tend to go to the upstairs one, as it's on my walk over to the Expo center, and the CES shuttle busses to the LVCC.\n\nI've seen a few walk-in closets bigger than the stand I frequent- but as long as it's big enough to hold the macaroons (and an attendant to sell them to me, along with a cup of coffee), that's all that matters.\n\nThe macaroons seem a little high-priced (but what in Vegas isn't?), but once you take a bit, you'll know instantly that you would pay more.  They're delicate and chewy all at the same time.  Not overly sweet, but sweet enough to satisfy a bakery craving.  The outer shell crumbles nicely, and the core is creamy and firm.\n\nI dream about these macaroons.  You need one.  Go get one- or a dozen."

Nested inside the Venetian hotel hidden behind its theater, this bakery usually has a long line and by the time you get to the front everything is sold out! Their actual restaurant location is near the clock tower--but I'm not sure if they offer bakery items. \n\nI ordered the salted caramel and chocolate macarons and would say they are comparable to Ginger Elizabeth in Sacramento--just two times bigger and more expensive! Not sure what all the hype is surrounding this place? Yes, their macarons are soft and chewy--but what macaron isn't? Their peanut butter cookies with cream in between was OVERLY sweet and honestly tasted worse than an Oreo. Maybe I ordered the wrong flavors but either way there was nothing AMAZING about this bakery. \n\nOverall, Bouchon is like the Chanel of macaron bakeries!  (Probably why they think it's Ok to overcharge everyone.)  While smaller, less famous, Dooney and Burke level bakeries, price their macarons at $1.75 MAX and taste exactly the same. \n\nIf you want something MOUTH WATERING visit the French Laundry in Yountville! Same owner but the food there is to die for!! Definitely worth the money versus these small desserts!"

Whatcha gonna do about it, punk? \n\nThis Bouchon Bakery is located at the Venetian Hotel, right underneath an escalator. In reality, this is not really a bakery but more of a small stand that sells Bouchon pastries. It's no bigger than a Starbucks you'd find inside a grocery store. Even though it's small they still have a good amount of baked goods. They have things like macarons, cookies, breads, sandwiches, pain au chocolat, muffins, bread pudding and more. They also sell coffees and other drinks. After our brunch at the Bouchon restaurant upstairs, my wife and I stopped by the bakery to get some goodies to go. Since we ate a big brunch, we only bought a few items. This is what we bought;\n\nCarrot Cake Whoopie Pie http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=Q7FOhoMWrBUJ2KsUr3UDSA\nCaramel Macaron http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=sj466FYKhGU57ud0VuAQzg\nNutter Butter Cookie Sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=6d6z_ZykwN8phHEamNR7bQ \n\nAll three treats were really good, especially the carrot cake whoopee pie, which was one of the best tasting carrot cake treats I've ever tried. The caramel macaron was not the best I've had but it was still really good. The same thing can be said about their nutter butter cookie sandwich. \nThe prices are good and the service is fast and friendly. \nIf you like Bouchon's baked goods, or if you're a Bouchon virgin, then this little stand is worth checking out."

You offer expensive baked goods but the macaron variety pack is well worth the trip to the Venetian.  \n\nI paid $17.50 for 6 macarons (lemon, orange, strawberry, chocolate, coffee, and vanilla). My favorite was the lemon one - very refreshing. These macarons are huge - bigger than most macarons I've seen from other places. Unfortunately they didn't travel well. These are delicate cookies that almost didn't survive the heat and the flight. But I got them home and the edges were crumbly and the creamy filling had partially melted. But still, they tasted good.

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so I figured I'd start my day properly with a visit to Bouchon Bakery.  I didn't feel like blowing my funds on a full sit-down brunch, so the bakery downstairs was the next best thing.  Not to say that the bakery is cheap (omfg, Porto's in LA...) but it's a more thrifty alternative. \n\nWe picked up a tomato/feta focaccia (which the server offered to warm up for us) and banana walnut muffin.  Both were delicious.  The muffin was moist and not too sweet; the focaccia was savory and tasty. Nothing fancy, but the quality was more or less there.  One day, I think I'll actually venture up into the restaurant... but for my first Vegas trip, the bakery would suffice. :)\n\nIf you're passing through the Venetian, go ahead and pick up a snack while you browse the interesting and eclectic assortment of goods that you probably can't afford."

It was topped with pesto, tomato and feta. It was perfectly savory and went really well with the delicious coffee that they serve there. The bakery is a great little breakfast place if you don't want to deal with the long wait at the actual Bouchon restaurant.\n\nOther tasty morsels included their Apple Croissant,  Pain Au Chocolate (chocolate croissant) and their veggie bread."

Everything looks so good!!!\n\nAs DIFFICULT as this is, however, I have decided to restrain myself. I plan on trying their assortment in moderation. That can only mean more Vegas trips for me, woohoo!\n\nThus far, I've tried their red velvet cupcake, a vanilla macaron, and of course, a few TKOs. Red velvet cupcake was good, but not the best I've had. The vanilla macaron, however, is one of the best I've had. They have the textures down nicely and a well-thought out balance of flavor. Not too subtle or overpowering. JUST right, which I can appreciate.\n\nAs for the TKO, I can tell you the exact setting of where I was when I last bit into one. The memory will stay with me forever. I had to stop walking in order to savor the moment. *pauses to think back...* Anyways, the filling cream inside is a soft pillow of sweetness that melds perfectly with the decadent, chocolate cookie. It's a definite must-try.\n\nAs for the coffee, it's good. Too sweet for my taste, but it's not bad. Nothing out of this world either. It won't hurt as an accompaniment to the delectable pastries in store for you here though!"

I was on my way to the Phantom Theater to pick up my tickets for the night, and I passed by Bouchon Bakery. I was suckered into their macarons. They sell them individually and in a pack. I couldn't resist and I couldn't decide on which to get. My love told me I could get whichever one I wanted, while he orders a turkey cranberry sandwich. \n\nSo I ended up getting that pack. Yes, fat girls' problems, but it's worth it. They were of six different colors, There's a vanilla, chocolate, coffee, pistachio, raspberry, and caramel flavored. I posted a picture of it, colors do get to me. They're not too sweet, which I liked. My favorite ones were the pistachio and the coffee ones. I find the jam inside the raspberry one to be a little too overwhelming. The size is enough to split with someone else, especially if you want a bit of everything at once.\n\nTheir sandwiches are pretty good too, especially for a quick lunch. The baguette bread was crunchy on the outside and quite soft in the insides. Too bad I devoured it too soon (I wanted to spend more time with my macarons). The bad part is that you have nowhere to sit and eat. It's like a grab and go cafe."

I was in the Venetian, and accidentally ran into this little gem. I was unprepared, shocked, excited!\n\nI knew that I wanted to try the macaroons. At the $3.50 a pop, I could only justify getting one. I settled on my favorite flavor, pistachio, and ordered a chocolate chip cookie as well. \n\nThe macaroon was overly sweet. To me it tasted like an Andes mint flavored macaroon, so maybe they use mint for color? There was only a subtle hint of pistachio. I was completely disappointed. The macaroons in the freezer section at Walmart are 10 times better.\n\nThe chocolate chip cookie was okay. The chocolate chips were fantastic, but the cookie was just average. Definitely not something I'd go back for.\n\nIf you're on the Strip, there are far better options that are more deserving of your money and caloric intake. Skip this one!"

Selection was not great, but it is a satellite location and it was later in the day. There was still enough to choose from, but nothing tasted very fresh.\nThe almond croissant was absolutely gorgeous but dry and hard to chew. \nI cannot judge the macarons because, not unlike sushi, I realize they're popular but I have no idea why. You can have my share of those and the pork belly, too.\nThe peanut butter sandwich cookie was good, but had too much overly sweet filling (this coming from a glutton), and the TKO (oreo) she got was rich and chocolaty but a disappointment with it's hardened filling that should have been creamy. \nNot sure where or when these were actually baked, but I made both of these cookies at Christmas from the Thomas Keller cookbook, and, god strike me dead, the ones I made tasted better. Could it just be the freshness factor?\nIn the interest of full disclosure, Rosebud HAD visited the Yountville location in recent memory, so her expectations were high, but I was only expecting for the professionals to do it better than me, and was still disappointed.\nIn addition, there are little tables out in the foyer to sit and enjoy your pastries, but there was no enjoyment when a couple of drunks stumbled up, sprayed a giant tourist drink on the wall, and to our dismay started to settle in. Fortunately, a pleasant little man who was welcoming all passers-by into the hotel struck up a conversation and led them quietly away to parts unknown. Hope it was down to the basement for an old school butt kickin'.\nAnyway, I was planning to try the leftovers later and give them a second chance, but I wandered out into the kitchen to discover the anaconda with a gallon jug of milk in one hand and the empty wrappers in the other.

Yes, slightly better than Paulette's because they were more contrast in texture (super crunchy exterior and creamy center) and I loved how big they are. We tried their gift pack of 6 flavors (chocolate, vanilla, coffee, pumpkin, strawberry, and pistachio). My favorite was chocolate & coffee, my man loved the pumpkin. \n\nThomas Keller-- if you're reading this, can you please open up a bakery in San Francisco??? :)"

The only unique thing is that they are huge, so the price is worth it.\n\nWe ordered the salted caramel, pistachio, and coffee flavors. I think the coffee one was the best since it wasn't too sweet. Caramel was the sweetest and got difficult to eat near the end since each bite got worse and worse. It was the first time that I wish my macaron was actually smaller than bigger!\n\nOverall I'd probably skip this place next time I'm back and try out a different bakery!"

Nearby was a small Bouchon Bakery which I had never heard of.  My son informed me it was pretty well known as the best bakery in the country so we decided we had to try something.  A chocolate croissant and coffee was the choice to enjoy sitting by the canal and enjoying the views, you could easily imagine yourself in Venice.\n\nThe pastry was wonderful, I can see how the reputation was earned.  I noticed a cookbook on display and ordered it when I got home.  The Bouchon Bakery cookbook is a masterpiece of baking photography, recipes and documentation of historical French baking techniques.  You can look at it and just drool for hours.  The cookbook is a little unweldy in size but lures you into thoughts you could actually create something this good yourself, if you were willing to do as much work and devote the time to make some of these classic baking creations."

Yesterday my wife and I picked up a pistachio macaron, a peanut butter and jelly macaron and a chocolate chip cookie.  All three were fantastic.  In the past couple years, on prior trips, I've also had their cinnamon rolls, sandwiches, cookies, treats - you name it.  If Bouchon Bakery sells it, it won't just be good - you can bet it will be great.  I'm giving Bouchon Bakery 4 stars rather than 5 stars because of the staff and because of the lack of seating.  The staff doesn't really display much of a sense of urgency, so the line doesn't move as quickly as it should, and there is nowhere nearby to sit down.  Still, fantastic place.  Highly recommend."

We got a wide selection of items: chocolate almond croissant, pain au raisin, strawberry croissant, chocolate croissant, beignet, pecan roll, and a few others that I can't remember. The only things that I really liked were the strawberry croissant that had a streusel on top and the beignet. I thought everything else tasted a little dry. BTW the latte was really good. Overall the prices weren't bad considering you're inside a casino in Vegas and everything is more expensive. I thought the majority of the pastries were better than average but not as good as any basic pastry shop in a Paris train stop. I don't think I would go out of my way to stop there, but would stop if it was on my way. Frankly the croissant shop around the corner from my house makes a lighter, fluffier and tastier croissant, but their coffee sucks. After reading some if the other posts, I wish I would have gotten a macaroon but I couldn't justify paying $3.50 for one. There's an italian bakery in San Francisco's little italy that makes these and sells them for less than a $1 a piece and they're perfect. Although they're a little smaller."

They were very good though. \n\nGreat place to grab a little bite or a treat for any type of meal. Besides for having an amazing pasty case they also have all types of savories like sandwiches and salad, they even have a chicken wrap!

Although this particular day didn't seem to be a busy day for the hotel, we found Bouchon extremely busy. Hmm, that would normally indicate a top notch restaurant, eh?\n\nOur wait?  It was about 45-50 minutes,,, so naturally I was expecting some really top notch food to be coming. In fact, I was really counting on having some gourmet waffles this particular morning! Well, would you believe it, this place actually ran out of waffles!!! How do you run out of waffles? Sure, perhaps a restaurant could run out of frozen Lego waffles, but I would expect THIS restaurant to be making their own fresh waffles- which you should NEVER run out of!  Unbelievable... it's just flour, eggs, sugar, milk... not much required!  I got no excuses, just \"we're out\".\n\nOkaaaay... well, after I got over the fact they ran out of waffles, I ordered some really basic pouched eggs (which I expected to arrive in front of me tout de suite).  Nope, I was once again extremely disappointed!!!  Delivery of our basic food order was incredibly slow - making our whole experience at Bouchon a huge time waster during an otherwise beautiful morning.\n\nSolution?  Well, for the rest of our stay at the Venetian we boycotted Bouchon and had some great fast and delicious breakfast meals at the Food Court... which is the place to go if you don't want the hassles you might be subjected to at Bouchon.  Perhaps the test is to ask how long your wait will be at Bouchon and then judge... good luck! :)"

            "review": "I've been to the Bouchon restaurants in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas.  Both experiences were okay but nothing particularly exceptional.  I've read a lot of good things about the Bouchon Bakery though so I was still eager to give it a try.\n\nBouchon Bakery is conveniently located near the guest elevators on the casino floor.  The bakery is a simple open storefront.  They have glass display counters showcasing the many attractive pastries and desserts while coffee is made/assembled in the background.  I went three times and it was busy on each visit; still, lines moved quickly each time because service was organized.\n\nI had a good sampling of their offerings and most of what I had was good.  Here is the rundown.\n\n(Pain Au Raisin) This was nice croissant dough that was mixed with golden and dark raisins.  The pastry was good.  It had a good crispness on the outside, but it still had a nice flakiness and softness at the center.  It was nicely sweet but not overpowering.  The raisins were plump and flavorful--too often raisins are overly shriveled in these types of pastries.\n\n(Chocolate Bouchon) This was a chocolate brownie shaped like a wine cork.  The bouchon I had was dusted with powdered sugar.  It also had a little bit of fudgy chocolate ganache in the center, which may not have been the intention (a later bouchon I had seemed to lack this fudge).  The brownie was good.  Good, rich chocolate flavor and the appropriate texture of a brownie.\n\nI have noticed that a lot of bakeries will alter the brownie recipe to create a moister brownie with a longer shelf life, which results in a fudgy brownie that is not really a brownie.  I like how the brownie here was baked as it should have been.  Because of that, the Bouchon here may not have been the moistest brownie, but it was still satisfying and thankfully still a brownie.\n\n(Macarons) I had three here--caramel, vanilla and coffee.  All the flavors were good, but if I had to pick, I would probably say the caramel was the best.  Good and smooth cream centers that were flavorful.  The macarons' outside shells had a light crispness while the inside was soft and chewy.  The macarons here were larger than most macarons I've had (priced higher too at a little over $3 a piece).\n\n(Chocolate Croissant) This (or maybe the apple croissant) was probably my least favorite thing here and it may have a lot to do with how I am not the biggest fan of chocolate croissants.  I think part of it has to do with how I don't like how big and soft they tend to be.\n\nThe croissant was light, crispy and flaky.  The croissant featured a thick and generous chocolate bar at the center.  The croissant was fine though it was very similar to the other good chocolate croissants I've had (and it did not really stand out).\n\n(Apple Croissant) This pastry was not your typical apple pastry.  The bottom was a flat puff pastry base.  It was topped with apples and then a slightly crunchy and sweet cinnamon streusel-like topping (similar to a Dutch apple pie).\n\nIt tasted fine, but it was not as good as other apple pastries I've had.  The pastry base was a little firm and thick.  It lacked the light crispness and flakiness of a good croissant.  The apple flavor was not as prominent as I would have liked, which was mainly due to the generous portion of the cinnamon streusel (kind of overwhelmed the apple flavor).\n\nService was good and pleasant on all of my visits.\n\nPricing was about what you would expect with most of the options in the $3-$4 range.  I would imagine that most bakeries/pastry shops in Las Vegas (even bad ones) would be charging similar prices.  The quality at Bouchon Bakery was high and because the prices were reasonable enough, this one might be worth the extra walk or the extra casino hop if you get a hankering for a good pastry during your stay.\n\nThe Venetian offers complimentary valet parking.  Like other major casinos, I imagine they would have complimentary self-parking as well."

( Picture: http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/7BtF3VZBv1XjqkUhIyZB8Q/l )\nIn the box (from left to right) was a rasberry macaron, an orange macaron, a lemon macaron, a hazelnut/cream/(?) macaron, an espresso macaron, and a chocolate macaron. \n\nMy favorite was the hazelnut/cream/(?) followed by the lemon and the espresso. I found the rasberry too tart and the orange too strong. They were delish AND I did share half of each macaron.\n\n5 stars for delicious snacks and pretty, see-through packaging."

I really need to adjust my expectations accordingly because due to the hype, I always associated Bouchon with all things awesome and so far, all my experiences have bordered only OK to meh (my other experiences: Bouchon Bakery in NYC & Bouchon in Bev Hills). \n\nBut I'm just mostly sad..the fool me once, fool me twice thing, now fooled me the third time!!! During our trip here for NYE2012, we had some time to kill before all the festivities and took a walk on the strip. I spotted Bouchon bakery and excitedly pointed out to my bestie that this place is suppose to have the BEST MACARONS! That got her all excited too so we picked up a pre-boxed of mini (6 for $12) to share a bunch of different flavors and bask in its glory. \n\nThe first 3 out of the box were straight up stale. We wouldn't have realized it until we got to the last 3 and realized how much better tasting those were. At $2 for each dinky one, that is unacceptable. \n\nIn the future, I would definitely question the pre-boxed stuff and ask how long it has been sitting there. The premium price tag should mean consistency. \n\nI am disappoint."

The coffee's quite good (I got a regular latte), a pain au chocolat (also known in America as a chocolate croissant), and two macarons: orange, and coffee.\n\nThe pain au chocolat was ok; it was denser than ones I've had in Paris. I asked for it to be heated up, but it was barely heated through. It would probably have been heaven if it had warmed up. But despite its dense interior, the exterior was crunchy and flaky.\n\nThe macarons were quite large. Both of my flavors were cream-fillings, which I didn't realize. I prefer jam/preserve fillings. The orange was OK; nothing special. The coffee one was good, but the cream filing was very light and squished out at every bite. \n\nOverall, I expected better of something in the Bouchon empire. I also thought the prices were quite high, considering it was a pastry stand and didn't have seating immediately near it, and because it's Vegas."

The pros are just about everything else.\n\nIn terms of setting, the place is a cute little stand overflowing with all manner of sweet treats palatably displayed.  An energetic staff deals with a fair crowd in a friendly, efficient manner.  You can order hot drinks as well as pastries.  I tried a spiced hot chocolate, which was a bit thin and not quite irresistible, but tasty nonetheless.\n\nThe pastries were phenomenal.  I picked up a croissant, a cheese danish, and a TKO.  The croissant was flaky, endlessly layered, and rich with buttery flavor.  It was one of the best croissants I've ever tasted.  The cheese danish was easily the best cheese danish I've ever tasted, a luscious golden pastry perfect in every way, completed by a delectable cheese filling heightened with lemon.  The TKO was true to its humble Oreo roots yet elevated chocolate and white stuff to heavenly splendor with its moist cakey outsides and fluffy cream.\n\nI also bought a couple boxes of macarons, one as a gift and one to eat as soon as possible.  The box came with six flavors - raspberry, lemon, vanilla, espresso, chocolate, and pistachio.  I was a little bit disappointed not to have a salted caramel, but it's hard to be sad in the face of good macarons.  Bouchon's were not the best I've had, but they were very good, with great yielding shells and light insides that delivered sugar without getting saccharine.\n\nFrom what I understand, there are plans for a Bouchon Bakery in Los Angeles.  I almost hope I don't live near it, as I don't think I'll keep off weight with those pastries within a five mile radius."

Multiple times I drag myself here to buy a set of assorted Macarons for my airplane trip back to the bay, and each time the Macarons hit the spot. Soft and perfectly sweet (fabulous with an Americano), the macarons are perfectly sized and chewy, not too soft, not too hard. \n\nNo matter what it is, you can be sure that the pastries are fresh and as tasty as you remember them. I've had the brownies, gingersnaps, and Chocolate Croissants and as well, and they were all pretty awesome. \n\nI mean, what negative things can you really say about chocolate, sugar, and butter? :)\n\nSee you next time, Bouchon! :)"

Since we couldn't all afford the real deal, we stopped by the bakery which is right across from the Phantom of the Opera Theater. It was around breakfast time so I got a croissant and the carrot cake cookie. The croissant was so soft and buttery. I liked the carrot cake cookie too but it's a lot of sugar. I couldn't finish it all in one sitting so I saved some for later. I thought I would be back to get some macaroons - they are the hugest I've ever seen - but I never made it back so that's something to get next time.\n\n*Update* Finally tried the vanilla and raspberry macaroons. Delicious! Soft with lots of filling and full of flavor. These are bigger than those bite sized macaroons they serve at a lot of other places but about the same price at $3."

They were so good, I kept on getting those two same things here:\n\n1) Turkey and cheese baquette (toasted optional).

So sad I discovered these late, as I was always focused on #1 above.  They have choices such as lemon, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla.  I got the vanilla. \n\n**pause** \n\nMelt. In. Your. Mouth. So. Delicously. Amazing. Macaron.  \n\nWhere have you been all my life? \n\nI've always thought the term \"macaron\" were reserved only for those coconut dropball cookies, but I learned from Eunice K. that this term also applied for this hamburger-shapped cookie sandwich filled with vanilla cream and coated with a light crunchy meringue-like coat.\n\nIf you are in for a quick breakfast or lunch, Bouchon has quality pastries, sandwiches, coffee and tea for that to-go meal you need.  Two big thumbs up from me.\n\n**Just a note, it's a stand around the corner from Grand Luxe Cafe in the Venetian.  Nothing fancy.  Just a stand that serves delicious bakery items.

All of my friends have been ranting and raving about macarons, and I wanted to see what the hype was all about!  I guess I had high expectations..\n\nI expected a nice large bakery, but it was small.. and had a few selections.

I bought 6, only because I didnt know when i would try them again, and I dont know where I can find these in San Diego. \n\nIm really glad i bought that many because they ended up tasting really good!

Those strawberry croissants that everyone was raving about. I was imagining fresh macerated strawberries, perhaps with a touch of cream, inside a buttery, flakey, chewy croissant. What did I get? Something like the love child of a fruit pie with crumble top and a danish. Yes, it's a croissant. Sort of. It's very buttery, but very flat. There aren't that many strawberries in it. And the flavor is dominated by the crumble topping (butter, sugar, cinnamon). It was not bad, it was just, eh, whatever. Definitely not worth getting up early to buy before they sell out. And definitely not worth getting more than once, if at all. I would say save your money for the macarons. \n\nOh, I almost forgot--there's some kind of round cheese danish type sweet that's AMAZING. I ate it at the restaurant, but if they have it at the bakery, you will not be disappointed. Get that instead.\n\nLocation: \n\nInside the Venetian. It's a little difficult to find if you are on the strip coming from the direction of the Wynn. Once you get to the Venetian you'll see the entrance to the casino (to the right will be the gondolas). Just go through the doors. Once in the casino, you'll see the sports book area to your right. Go straight through past the slots, table games and more slots towards the theater (currently showing the Phantom of the Opera). You know you're close when you see some restaurants to the right and an information desk in front of you. Bouchon Bakery is behind the information desk on the other side in a stand that faces the theater."

Located in the casino level of the Venetian (under the escalators). You can find this one-stop shop infamous for their coffee, cakes and other carb-a-licious sweet goodies!\n\nWhat did I try?\n- BOUCHON = the French term \"bouchon,\" in English means \"cork stopper\" or \"cork in the mouth of a wine bottle\". In this case their \"bouchon\" was in the shape of a cork but in a cupcake form since it was a mini-brownie! This was VERY delightful! (emphasis on the VERY) In fact, the bouchon was soft and moist, chocolate-y, yet not over-powering. There was a touch of powdered sugar and for ($2) for one of these, you better savor the scrumptiousness! It was very heavenly!\n\n- FRENCH MACARONS = I bought the to-go set (for $17.50), which includes all 6 flavors of their French macarons. They have chocolate, espresso, pistachio, strawberry, lemon and vanilla. ESPRESSO was my favorite out of all of them!\n\n- CROISSANT = simple, buttery, flaky and couldn't stop myself from eating this! Caution for some of those buttery flakes falling upon your self! Word of advice: don't leave the evidence laying around!\n\n- BREAD PUDDING = was very delightful! Filled with some custard, cinnamon, raisins and apples, this dish was very well put together! If you left me alone with this, it can be quite dangerous! I'm glad I shared!\n\n- VEGGIE BREAD = made with fresh tomatoes and greens. It also had olives, pinenuts and delicious cheese! It tastes even better when TOASTED! (FYI = if toasted, expect to wait 3-4 minutes for it to be complete). But overall, even though I'm not vegetarian, I'd opt for this again!\n\nOverall thought?\nAwesome with a capital \"A\"!!! I was a carb-fix so I did not sample the coffee. But there were lines of people who were ordering the stuff! Service was quick and it was nice that they were able to toast the veggie bread! The next time I visit here I'll be sampling the cup of joe with an espresso-flavored French macaron! Until next time my sweet, carb-a-licious bakery, I am forever a fan!"

I decided he too needed to smuggle baked goods in his luggage. I think he did a better job than me.\n\nI only asked for bouchons, but I was also given a chocolate tart. I think my heart stopped for a couple seconds while eating it, and I'm not sure if it's because I shouldn't have eaten the whole thing by myself or because it tasted of chocolate heaven. Even though it had been in the freezer for a couple days, it was still pretty damn amazing.\n\nThe bouchons were just not that amazing in retrospect after the tart. They were good, but I can make a glorified brownie too if necessary. I am far too lazy for a tart. \n\nI would eat everything again though, and then some more, don't get me wrong."

I thought the texture of the macarons were a bit too chewy. The weird thing though, the macarons tasted better the next day!

According to her, this is just a small kiosk so there wouldn't be that much to try anyway. But, back to the macarons. In my limited experience as a macaron connoisseur, they have all been bite-sized - no bigger than the size of a half dollar coin. These macarons are supersized! They seem like a novelty item. The bigger size does not take away from the consistency of having a crispy shell with a soft and chewy inside. How do these compare with Paulette's, which have become the standard for good macarons? The texture is definitely there, but the flavors still go to Paulette's. The flavors are limited to: chocolate, raspberry, orange, lemon, espresso, and vanilla - good, but not amazing. Make me a giant almond-flavored macaron and you will get your 5th star. Oh, these macarons are not cheap by the way. One big MoonPie-sized macaron will cost you around $3.50. I still can't get over their humorously large size."

It had no pulp which always makes me question whether it really is \"fresh squeezed\" but it tasted fine.  My sandwich, turkey in a sweet twisted bread was incredible.

That cookie was everything that I imagined macaroons would be like and more. The outside slightly crunchy with a soft, moist center that just makes you so happy you decided not to share.

The perfect ratio of crisp to chew, just enough raisins to keep things interesting and that butter flavor, true butter flavor, not that artificial butter flavored shortening garbage.  \n\nThey also do their version of a \"nutter butter\" cookie and if you're a fan of those peanut butter cookies then just times this version by 10. oh yea, it's that good.

I didn't find any plain almond croissants, only ones with a chocolate drizzle. When i inquired for plain ones, was curtly told he was sold out, so i asked for the ones with a drizzle. I next asked if i could customize the box of macarons, was told no. So i said i'd just get 4 pieces of macarons. When i get to the cashier i was told my bill was $28+. I wasn't thinking and just handed my card over. They never said thank you. Walking to the Palazzo, i realized it seemed too pricey, i opened my bag and realized that they put a box of macarons which i never ordered. I normally won't mind this but i was very disappointed and displeased with their service. I got home and tried their almond croissant with drizzle and was not impressed.  The pastry was not as flaky and a bit on the hard side. The macarons are not as swoon-worthy as i expected them to be, maybe the horrible customer service left a bad taste in my mouth. I would rather bring my business to Patisserie Manon and support local business."

The best of what I sampled was the chocolate croissant: it had two ribbons of chocolate in it, which was quite nice.  However, the pastry was just a bit too tough when it should have been tender, and it was too greasy.\n\nI also took tastes of four different macaron flavors: chocolate, vanilla, raspberry and lemon.  The chocolate was far and away the best of the four, but it was more like a brownie than a macaron.  The weakest were the raspberry and lemon, which had too much oozy filling.\n\nWorst of what I tried: the pain au raisin.  Pain au raisin is supposed to be a custard raisin roll, not a raisin danish.  Flat, extremely greasy... I will only grudgingly acknowledge that there were enough raisins and that they were soft and tender, but that couldn't salvage the thing. \n\nI don't know, maybe I'm holding this place to unfairly high standards, but I know that pastry can be better."

It's located next to The Phantom of the Opera Theater, next to The Grand Lux Cafe, inside The Venetian. \n\nThe day I decided to try the Bouchon Bakery it was the morning I was in search of a good latte and pastry/cookie. When I went down the elevators from my hotel room, I spotted this little spot packed and busy. I came closer and saw what all the buzz was about. Delicious looking pastries, breads, desserts, and more delicacies! I figured it was a go! I really did not want to spend more than $6 like I did the night before on a small cappuccino at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf that was mediocre.\n\nWOW! Everything looked so amazingly fresh! I really wanted to try their foccacia that had feta, onion, and oven dried tomatoes and their chocolate croissant or their sensational looking fruit tarts or Bavarian Creams that had the golden chocolate transfer patterns...but I had to resist! I was going to have lunch with friends and so I decided to buy a vanilla soy latte and a cranberry biscotti. That combo was a winner! The latte was not too sweet and it went very well with the sweetness of the biscotti.\n\nThe next morning, before I left Vegas, I figured that I had to buy some macaroons! I purchased the chocolate and raspberry macaroons and they were very good. Their macaroons had the texture of a cross between a cake and a cookie but it fit it will! They were soft, chewy and the flavor swirled in my palate and it was not too sweet! The filling inside of them was just right and they did not look sloppy. Excellent! $3.50 each....little pricey but it's Vegas!\n\nYou can also purchase their coffee beans!\n\n\nCustomer services is very friendly!"

So I asked what flavors were the macarons and he said pistachio, orange, vanilla and chocolate. So i got the vanilla and chocolate (original flavors) to see how they taste.\n\nThe macarons were a decent size, took about 4-5 bites to finish them. As I tried the vanilla... it was sooo good!!!! the inside is like eating ice cream and other outer layers was soft and a nice chewy texture. \n\nThe chocolate one was good too but it was too chocolatey and rich for me.

I ended up giving one away (not sure which one it was, hopefully not one that I would regret), but I kept the rest in a tightly sealed container in the fridge and I devoured them throughout the week.\n\nPink - My guess is that this was some kind of berry, maybe strawberry or raspberry, but it was yum.\n\nGreen - Pistachio. Great for nut lovers. I personally am not a big fan of pistachios in anything other than the nut itself, but the fact that I was eating a macaron, it didn't bother me.\n\nBrown - Chocolate. I'm a huge chocolate fanatic, so this was orgasmically (if that even is a word) good. \n\nYellow - Lemon. Perfect for those who like their sweets a little tart.\n\nBeige - Coffee. This was my all time favorite of the batch. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I do love the taste of coffee and the fact that I can't have any right now or the next four months I think made this one top it all. \n\nBut after eating the whole box, I think I had enough macarons for awhile. =)"

I had a short list of places I wanted to check out and someone suggested Bouchon Bakery. Apparently this seemed like an impossible journey as my friends literally trekked all over The Venetian trying to find this place. Finally, after probably an hour of walking, we found Bouchon Bakery. Casino level, tucked behind the escalators.\n\nWhen we finally found BB, I was disappointed to find how small the bakery was (like a stand in the mall food court), but boy did the macarons not disappoint! I bought the sample pack + 1 pistachio because I'm obsessed with this flavor. My oh my! This was so delicious! It was just like a macaron should be - delicate and crisp on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. I was in heaven and I spent the next 2 days eating the rest of the macarons (shared with my travel mates of course, I'm not that much of a fatty!). They are rather large, so they are definitely good for sharing if you get a few.\n\nThis is definitely a must if you love macarons!"

I like the cute little stand hidden away from everything else (just enter the Venetian and keep walking back and back from the casino floor), not a fan of the lack of seating (the food court is just upstairs and down a hallway a bit though).  We had vanilla and pistachio macarons and some other small pastry.  \n\nMacarons were hard on the outside and the filling was cloying- they'd been sitting for too long, perhaps?  Big, which is nice, but ugh, CHEWY.  Not a word I want with my lighter than air cookies.  Two stars because I have hopes and I really did enjoy Bouchon.  And the other pastries looked like they could be OK or even good."

I guess that means they're pretty good.\n\nSo, I tried one of their chocolate chip cookies -- huge, about the size of 4 normal sized cookies. The flavor was good, not intensely sweet, but I've had better. It could have used larger chunks of chocolate.\n\nI also tried the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo). Loved it! Although is was bordering on being too sugary and sweet, the chocolate cookies were soft and chewy (but not too dense) and the creme was fabulous.\n\nThe place is a little tough to find, but it's worth the trip."

I was exhausted, famished, and yearning for that luxurious little treat.  Enter: beyond-deliicous onion/bacon Danish pastry.  Flaky puff pastry formed into the cutest pinwheel, stuffed with the perfect proportions of ricotta/cream cheese, and topped with bacon and caramelized onions.  Oh.  Em.  Geee.\n\nSeemingly popular for their macarons, I picked up a couple: pistachio and raspberry.  The flavors were slight and a bit too sweet for my taste but were easily the largest macarons I've ever seen!  A great novelty snack or gift.\n\nWith small bites and a gorgeous setting, Bouchon Bakery would be an excellent addition to a personal Las Vegas Strip food tour!"

The pain au chocolat was super flaky and had a very respectable amount of chocolate inside. The epi loaf was just plain good bread, but the preserves were unexpectedly delicious: blackberry jam, just bursting with flavor.\n\nI picked up the large box of macarons on my way home, which comes with a flavor assortment (raspberry, pistachio, salted caramel, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate). Laduree is still my favorite (airier, more delicate) but these were pretty darn good. I'm not sure they were as fresh as they could have been, they had a date sticker on them that was two days old. I think that may have been when they were baked? I was in a rush so I didn't notice until I was in the cab. Regardless, they were pretty great macarons.\n\nLook for this place near the Grand Lux cafe in the Venetian (confusingly, there's also a Grand Lux cafe in the Palazzo).

I was hemming and hawing about which flavor to get when my sweet fianc\u00e9 gently asked me who I was kidding.  I rolled my eyes and asked for the box of 6 assorted flavors.\n\nThey're huge.  They're perfect.  \n\nCaramel, Chocolate, and Vanilla are my favorites but the Raspberry, Pistachio and Coffee are delectable too.  The flavors aren't as inventive as some larger bakeries with more offerings but between the chewy texture and the sumptuous buttercream, these are hard to beat.\n\nOne star revoked for the size, limited offerings, and tricky location (under the elevator near the theater.)"

Everything is enormous, from their macaroons to their, dense, filling bread pudding. Mix it in with a cup of coffee or hot chocolate and you have a perfect pair.\n\nThough the pricing is a bit expensive, with even the macaroons hovering at $3 each, your wallet might not appreciate you going on a spending spree in this one area; however, if you do decide to splurge, at least you know this is one bet you're not gambling on."

There's no secret, macaroons are just simply heavenly and to die for but these were probably the best I've ever had, no lie.\n\nThe filling was a little more buttery which I loved because it contrasted with the sweet crispy cookie perfectly. I splurged and bought 2 gift boxes, one of the mini's and one regular sized. At first glance, the prices may shock you but for the size of the cookie and quality in taste, it's well worth it.\n\nI didn't actually get to eat most of them until I got home since I was stuffing my face with everything else on the strip haha. Scared that the cookies would lose the crispiness, I literally scarfed down my macaroons in a few days. I was surprised though on the fourth day, the cookies were nearly fresh still. From experience, I haven't had any macaroons stay edible for more than one or two days (if they weren't eaten yet!).\n\nNext time I will try the cupcakes and such and hopefully not stop by on a full tummy. Be back in a few months maybe??.."

The only other places I've had them are Vanilla Bakeshop in Santa Monica and Europane in Pasadena. I'm going off on a quest to search for macarons better than these in LA. Bring it!\n\nI bought the set of flavors here, and it was totally worth it to try all the flavors! Now I know which ones are my favorite...and they have to be Raspberry, Vanilla Bean, and Coffee. I think these flavors are more fragrant and they coffee has a deep earthy coffee taste to it, just how a coffee flavor should be. The lemon and orange were a little too sweet for me, and I just somehow don't like the citrus flavored macarons as much. And I never had a thing for chocolate flavored anything, so take my opinions with my preferences in mind.\n\nThe shells are very delicate, as they crack quite easily, but the crunch had just enough soft chew too, and on top of the cream or ganache inside, it was heavenly! \n\nI also tried the carrot cake cookie and it was okay. I think the carrot cake could have been more moist. The cream cheese filling was good though. =) There was also a really cute sweets stand next to this stand. Oh, and Bouchon Bakery is not a store. It's literally like a little stand! Downstairs by the casinos and the Phantom of the Opera Theater is where you'll find it. =) And make sure you get there before they close if you want to buy anything. My mom was saying we should go there right before our POTO show started for some dessert after dinner, but I thought that was a huge mistake and made us go in the afternoon before we went outlet shopping and dinner. THANK GOD. It was closed when we came back to watch our show.\n\n[Phantom of the Opera was amazing too! But that's beside the point... :)]\n\nIf you're a macaron fan, definitely try theirs. Overpriced, but you'll forget about that once you try it. =D"

Seriously, I have NEVER been treated more rudely or disrespectfully at ANY establishment.  This was such a big disappointment for me because I am crazy about Bouchon in Napa. Anytime I'm up there I will wake up early, drive way out of my way...anything to get some Bouchon treats!  I'm such a huge fan.  When I found out they had a location in Vegas I dragged my boyfriend and a few friends out to find it.  When we got to the bakery I was a little disappointed because it was a small stand with a smaller selection, not a full store, but still so excited to pick out some tasty treats and get one of Bouchon's amazing sandwiches.  I stood at the glass cabinet like a kid on Christmas and picked out 5-7 of my favorite pastries and then a sandwich and a latte for my boyfriend and I to share.  They asked if I wanted it toasted and I said yes.  I paid and then stood at the counter waiting for our drink and the toasted sandwich. The drink came fairly quickly.  But then we waited...and waited...and waited...and no one was paying attention to us.  It was like that section of the counter was invisible. There wasn't that much of a line so after a lengthy wait I walked around to the front of the counter again and asked about the status of the sandwich. She handed me one that was wrapped sitting on the counter and I noticed it was not warm, but thought maybe it had cooled off from sitting for so long.  We found some seats in the mall and I took a bite..COLD all the way through. This had not been toasted at all.  I LOVE these sandwiches warm so I went back and stood in line AGAIN like I was going to order something (only way to get someone's attention) and when I got to the counter asked the woman if she would mind toasting it because it did not feel toasted at all.  She took the sandwich from me and put it on the counter, looked at me, and then fished through some receipts on the counter and said \"You didn't pay for this.\" ??!! I paid you, I bought all this stuff I'm holding! \"No, you didn't pay for the sandwich, only the other stuff.\"  Apparently she forgot to ring up the sandwich and was now acting like I stole it. Really? I'm just trying to get a sandwich and some pastries, she made a mistake, and now I'm a criminal.  Outrageous.  I didn't notice that she forgot to ring it up because I purchased so many small items that my bill added up to $40-$50 and it seemed like the right amount!! She didn't even apologize for her mistake, I would have paid the extra, but she acted like I was trying to rob them so I just threw my hands up and walked away with the pastries I purchased to find lunch somewhere else.\n\nThis is why I will never go back to THIS LOCATION.  I was treated like a criminal, service was incredibly slow, and the staff was just plain rude.  There are plenty of other amazing places to get pastries in Vegas where you will actually be treated with respect."

Your macaroons are big & perfect amount of chewiness & crunch. It's still one of my favorites across the nation, comparing to Paulettes in LA or sleek macaroon shops in NYC. The macaroons can get too sweet sometimes, so just make sure you enjoy it with coffee or milk.

I've also stuffed my face with about a dozen of these at the bistro.\n\nMy only qualms are with the line, which at peak times can be ridiculous, the servers, who can be inattentive or somewhat forgetful when it comes to your order or requests that accompany your order, and that not all items are available year round, especially some of the fruit preserves, and without a website, or public forum to announce availability, sometimes you just need to call beforehand to see if they have something you are looking for. Also, they run out of things, which is a given considering it's not a huge location. They are a little counter tucked under a stairwell.\n\nBut certainly add this place to your list of early morning haunts. I'd rank it above Payard, below Jean Philippe Patisserie. So it's good.\n\nAnd make sure you buy a bag of bouchons (6 for $10) to go and don't forget to ask for a little bit of raspberry sauce on the side. Heat those puppies up in the oven for a few minutes, pour some of the raspberry sauce on top, make obscene noises while consuming."

Apparently there was some mix up about that because reviews for both businesses frequently show up on one another's pages, and now Yelp HQ has handled this by closing the old bakery page and opening a new one. \n \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nI'm somewhat surprised this business still has the Bouchon name on it- the quality is nowhere near what you receive at the bistro, despite a few shared items, nor is the quality. The TKO (Keller's version of the Oreo) is a fantastic sugarbomb, and the macarons are larger than most other places have them, but stick to the seasonal flavors and go earlier in the day. Cookie sandwiches here MUST be split between at least two people, they're large and delicious but probably pack over a day's worth of calories. As for their delicious epi bread? It's better when accompanied by a delicious dinner at the full restaurant. The chocolate bouchons are also better had there.\n\nThe service here is notoriously awful. I don't know if they're going for a detached snobby French aesthetic, but every cashier I've ever had the displeasure of working with here has had an attitude and a scowl. It's a simple job and it's in the service industry, how hard is it to make your face NOT look like you are on Death Row? The fact that the receipts here automatically print out a tip line is hysterical, I've received better service from an ATM."

I think I will go back for another 6 the next time I'm close to a Bouchon bakery. \n\nI enjoy their macaroons the most because they're sweet, but not over the top. I get a great taste without the pure sugar overpowering the flavor of the macaroon. I tried the pistachio, chocolate, lemon, vanilla, and coffee. Pistachio and chocolate were my favorite.\n\nTheir chocolate croissant was delicious. Buttery, light, and flaky. I LOVE flaky croissants even without reheating it!

I've been here twice and I still like it far more than the Beverly Hills location.\n\nDuring my last trip to Vegas in October, we came here spontaneously after LAVO Brunch. They have various desserts, including giant and mini macarons, giant cookies, cake, and other pastries. Currently, if you buy 5 giant macarons, you get one free. It's obviously a better deal than the box of six mini macarons, but the mini ones definitely look a lot more appetizing.\n\nAfter much contemplation, I got a box of six mini macarons for $15. The flavors included were pistachio, pumpkin, vanilla, sea salt caramel, and coffee, which were all very, very good. Amazing flavoring, texture, and consistency; the outer egg-shell like crust was perfectly thin, airy, and the inner had a soft, almost meringue texture. Hands down, the best macarons I've ever had, and they were still really good in the evening after leaving them out of the fridge for the entire day. They were so good, I finished all six in one sitting...\n\nIf you're looking for delectable macarons in Vegas, come here!"

I brought my friends along because they wanted to see the huge macaroons. Be careful though because the place is pretty difficult to find (I even had trouble with the directions given by the Venetian associates). \n\nThe only thing I purchased at this Bouchon Bakery was the full set of MACAROONS (a total of six pieces). NOTE: If you buy 5 macaroons, you get 1 free. The macaroons were about $3.50 each. \n\nI purchased a pre-packaged set of six macaroons, which containedVANILLA, PISTACHIO, RASPBERRY, COFFEE/CAPPUCHINO, CHOCOLATE (brownie?), AND A SPECIAL BOUCHON FLAVOR. Truthfully, since they were pre-packaged, I'm assuming the macaroons were made that day hopefully rather than the day before. Just to be safe, for anyone purchasing six, one of each flavor, go with the regular boxing where they grab the fresh ones made. \n\nI wanted to bring it home to Orange County to enjoy with my boyfriend, so I stuck it in the trunk and drove on home with the others. Need I remind you it was summer, but I never would have thought anything would have happened to the macaroons, sensitive creatures they are. \n\nSad to say, never ever leave your macaroons out in heat, even if it's not in direct sunlight. Room temperature is best. Why? Because when I opened the truck, my poor chocolate/brownie macaroon sort of melted and oozed out this liquid and traveled down the box and ruined my other macaroons. Some were also cracked already (dang, sensitive pastries)!!! \n\nThey all looked horrific by now, so I dare not show them to my boyfriend. As a result, I enjoyed them by myself. :) :) :) Hahaha.\n\nAnyways, onto the review of the tastings and enough of my ranting. \n\nIn the end, I prefer the Napa Valley Bouchon over this one.\n\nOverall, all the flavors were actually perfect and light. The only thing I have to say about the CHOCOLATE/BROWNIE macaroon was that it was a little too dense and chocolatey (probably because of the melting though). My favorites were the VANILLA and PISTACHIO. The coffee one was alright. If you like coffee flavored pastries, you might like this one. As for the RASPBERRY, I never got to taste it. *sobs* I accidentally left it out and the dang ants got to them. \n\nThis was a bad luck batch of macaroons is all I'm saying. On my part though, not the bakeries."

My boyfriend and I have a heard a lot about the croissants and pastries, and we decided to try out a smorgasbord of them for breakfast.\n\nWe tried (and loved):  The plain croissant, pecan sticky bun, cheese danish,, the strawberry croissant (special of the day), and the chocolate croissant (not the best, but still tasty).\n\nI would have rated it a full 5 stars if it wasn't for the service.  I ordered coffee and asked repeatedly for cream (of which I asked for when I originally ordered my coffee) and it didn't arrive until I reminded him 2 more times and my coffee got cold.  I tried to then get him to bring me hot coffee, but that took a while as well.\n\nAll in all, the pastries were amazing.  I saw other plates that I wanted to try, and we plan on going back!"

I'll just review the macarons, since the other stuff was good, but nothing special. They are 3.50 a piece, but are a lot bigger than the average macaron.  The cookie part is utter perfection, a nice outer shell with chewiness when you bite into it. The filling however, was too soft and buttery for me, especially the pistachio. I prefer my fillings to be a lot more thick and rich. My favorite was the caramel, didn't care for the chocolate at all. I'm glad to have tried it, but don't know if I would go back again - maybe if I stopped by and saw that they had a bigger selection, like more savory items."

The space is so small that the goods here are prepared at the restaurant upstairs and bussed down to the lower level.\n\nI was really hankering for a macaron but the flavors that day (raspberry, orange, espresso) didn't persuade me.  I got a ham and cheese baguette and a lemon currant scone. \n\nThe baguette was okay.  It came with two little sides of mayonnaise and cornichons.  I got it toasted, which now I felt I shouldn't have because it takes away from the texture of the bread.  A bummer was that the cheese wasn't even melted and there was an excessive amount of ham.  \n\nThe lemon currant scone was fairly good but I didn't find that it differed much from other scones I've had in the past.  The lemon flavor is subtle."

We decided to get a treat each day we were there. \n\nOn Sunday we decided to try the Red Velvet cupcake and it was really good! I thought for the price ($3.50) and the size of the cupcake it was a pretty good value. The frosting was really good, and I liked how there was a glob of frosting in the middle of the cupcake as well. If you are a frosting whore like me, you'll love it! \n\nOn Monday we decided to try the Fruit Tart, this was actually my favorite, but I am a huge Fruit Tart fan. It was topped with kiwis, strawberries, blueberries, peaches, and a fig! The fig was pretty tasty and unique. The custard was quite delicious and went well with the tasty crust. I have to admit I ate most of this one, sorry sweetie! \n\nOn Tuesday we had the Dark Chocolate Cupcake, this one was my GFs favorite, she loves dark chocolate so this one was all her. I thought it was good but I like milk chocolate better than the dark. This cupcake also had the glob of dark chocolate frosting in the middle of the cake. \n\nSo overall they were all good, I rank it Fruit Tart, Red Velvet,and Dark Chocolate. One funny note, my GF and I were thrown off my their plastic \"silverware\", the plastic forks/spoons/knives are silver and for a second we thought it was the real deal!

I indulged on the great richness of Bouchon Bakery located in the Venetian near the guest elevators!\n\nI was staying in the Palazzo but Bouchon's was just a short 5 minute brisk walk away. I love the fact that the bakery, is just a simple and open store. It's not big and extravagent - just an open storefront you might see walking down the street in Europe. Once my friends and I got here, there were so many choices starting from breakfast items like croissants, breads to dessert like massive chocolate chip cookies, macaroons and dessert beignets!\n\nI eventually ordered:\n* Almond brioche - it's almost like almond brittle baked on to a nicely toasted slice of brioche. Nice and buttery.\n* Chocolate chip cookie - A little too sweet for me but lots of butter :)\n* Assortment of macaroons - I got the box set which included every flavor - strawberry, orange, pistachio, vanilla, chocolate, espresso. The box set was $17.50 which is a steal when you do the math. Individual macaroons were $3.50 each. These macaroons weren't your normal sized macaroons either, they're about 3-4 times as big which makes me gladly hand over my money for these bites of delicious goodness.\n* Beignets - They come at $3.75 for two so I got both flavors that they had that day, raspberry and chocolate. The raspberry one was nice and sweet but was way overfilled with too much raspberry jelly - a little hard to eat. The chocolate one was heaven - rich chocolate ganache inside of a chocolate flavored beignet with chocolate sprinkles on top. Can it get any better than that?!\n\nThe macaroons were definitely the highlight of the bunch. They were sweet, crunchy, creamy and divine.\n\nI'm coming here everytime I'm in Vegas to get some Macaroons and try a few more of their delectable pastries."

I really liked the flakiness of the shell and the excellent dark chocolate inside.  \n\n-TKO--The Thomas Keller Oreo (3/5)  I didn't really enjoy this that much. I thought the cookie was light and yummy, but the inside filling didn't do it for me. But perhaps that's because I don't like oreos to begin with. Why did I get this? Idk. I guess I read so much about it on Yelp.  I would only get this if you like oreos.\n\nI do not crave sweet sugary foods (except for fruit!), but I'm glad I tried Bouchon bakery.  I'll be back next time to grab another sandwich and perhaps try more of their sweets!\n\n*See pics*"

There is a huge variety of baked goods, from breakfast pastries to dessert tarts. \n\nThe most memorable items are the French macaroons. They are larger and flatter than macaroons from other places.

The pistachio was nutty and more true to a real pistachio flavor than most macaroons. \n\nThe apple croissant was flaky on the outside and full of apples and crumbs on the inside. \n\nBouchon: These were a lot smaller than I had expected and more like a brownie than a fluffy cake that I expected.

As I generally cant stand any bakery item or dessert that is coffee-flavored, this came as a surprise to me. I think it's because the espresso flavor is so rich and pairs well with the creaminess of the butter cream sandwiched in between the cookie layers. It's like the cookie version of a latte. \n\nI wasn't particularly fond of the raspberry ones though.

Located on the first floor of the Venetian, it was a lot smaller than I'd imagined. It's not even an actual store, but rather a stand with only one display case. I got a raspberry macaron, a red velvet cupcake, and a carrot cake cookie to go. I was going to say that maybe they didn't taste as good as if I'd eaten them right away (had the cookie later that night, and the other 2 the next day) but all of them were sitting either in the display case, chilled, or out on top of the display case. I like my desserts warm and fresh from the oven, and none of these were that. All of the items were just fine, but I know they could've been better. I enjoyed the flavor of the macaron, and the cream cheese frosting on the cupcake was really cream cheesey, which isn't always the case. There was even frosting inside of the cake, so if you like frosting, you'd love this. The carrot cake cookie was probably the least impressive of the 3, but it's a nice, simple dessert if you're not too into the sweet stuff.\n\nOverall, decent desserts, but don't come with high expectations."

However, I was a little disappointed with my visit here. I decided on the red velvet cupcake and a caramel macchiato. For $3.50, the cupcake was a good deal for it was the size of a muffin! Most cupcakes I've had are for the same price but pretty dinky in size. The frosting wasn't overly sweet and the red velvet was nice and moist. It was a tad bit doughy though, but nonetheless pretty good. The coffee however, is where things start going downhill. Maybe I came on a bad day or maybe it was a new worker, but I've had caramel macchiato before at various coffee places and never had I had one like this. For $5 I got their smallest size and when I picked up my cup, I was surprised at how light my cup was compared to the other girls that ordered other Lattes and such. I opened my cup and found it to be filled halfway with foam, barely any coffee so I asked the barista if it was the correct order. He just kept saying that that's how it's suppose to be. It didn't seem right, but in any case, I didn't make a scene about it. $5 for half a cup of bitter coffee and foam is not well worth it! They also have a few other things there like sandwiches and such, but all were a bit pricey. Expected I suppose since it is Vegas."

Something else that caught my eye were these huge oreo looking things (Thomas Keller's version of the oreo).

I've personally never had a good macaroon before but Bouchon has since convinced me such deliciousness exists. The chocolate macaroon was beyond heavenly! I can't wait to try the other flavors next time. The chocolate croissant was to die for too. Crispy on the outside but soft and chocolate-y on the inside. What more could you ask for?! The BF also ordered their mocha special and was pleasantly surprised by the hint of nutmeg. Everything here was outstanding!"

Seriously, they are the size of the palm of my hand. This wasn't quite so fresh by the time I got around to eating it (completely my fault) but still tasted great. Crisp outside, chewy center.

We didn't order any of the baked goods but ordered a coffee and a hot chocolate. The drinks weren't anything spectacular; they scored below average for me. The hot chocolate was made out of milk but it tasted funcky. For Bouchon, I expected chocolate decadence, but I got none of that. The only good thing about the drink was the temperature because it was chilly and I depended on it to keep warm."

I got coffee & chocolate. These macarons are BIG...& cost $3.50 each! But it was worth trying!\n-iced vanilla latte: for some reason this iced coffee was really good! The coffee was strong & the vanilla made it just sweet enough. \n-almond brioche: imagine an almond croissant. Now take away the croissant & your left with the almonds & almond paste inside. Put this on top of a piece of thick, cripsy bread & you have almond brioche. I was good, but I like almond croissants better.    \n\nOverall I enjoyed bouchon bakery & wish there was a closer one!"

I don't know if it was because I came at 9PM for macarons but they were not the best as my friend had promised. I did the buy 5 get 1 free deal for the large ones (the smaller ones would've only cost a dollar less which made me ??? oh well) and got eggnog, salted caramel, pistachio, chocolate, and raspberry. Out of all the flavors, salted caramel was definitely the best, then pistachio, chocolate, raspberry, and eggnog. All of the macarons were too crunchy for my liking. The shells were slightly dried out and didn't have the chewiness I like biting into. And the flavors themselves weren't that vibrant. I didn't feel like I got the pure taste of each flavor in the macarons sadly. \n\nHonestly such a let down but what saved the trip to Bouchon for me was the chocolate almond croissant. I never thought I could like a croissant so much, but this one hit the spot. Even though it took me a full 5 days to finish the croissant, I thoroughly enjoyed every chocolatey bite and correct me if I'm wrong but I think there was also a spread of coconut in between the flakey buttery layers. The croissant didn't go stale and tasted a million times better lightly toasted in the convection oven. \n\nSo definitely come here for the chocolate almond croissant. Maybe swing by earlier in the day for fresher macarons? But my past macaron experiences have been much better than Bouchon (they tasted way better and lasted a lot longer) so take caution before you shell out about $3 a cookie."

            "review": "This small French dessert kiosk is located behind the escalator on the casino floor of the Venetian. The obscured location might be difficult to find, but somehow we always managed to stumble upon it. Without a seating area, the line alongside the large pastry counter may be long, but it usually gives us just enough time to make the right choices. \n\nMy favorite item was the PBC ($4.25). It came with a layer of salted peanut butter with a ring of chocolate, sandwiched in-between two thick cookies filled with bits and pieces of peanuts and chocolates embedded here and there. The centrality of the sweet and salty peanut flavor nicely intermingled with the dark semi-sweet chocolate. The cookies were firm with a nice crisp and crumbly texture. I am a big fan of peanut butter, and together, this sandwich cookie was a winner.\n\nI also enjoyed the palm size French Macarons ($3.50) and would highly recommend them. One of Santi's favorites, the Pistachio Macaron was semi-sweet, and carried a refined, natural pistachio flavor. The outer texture was crisp, egg shell-like, and delicate, followed by an air pocket before reaching the base of the shells and its creamy filling. Together, the macaron had a good chew, but the base of the shell was a bit stiff and thicker than necessary. \n\nComparatively, I had better results with the Salted Caramel Macaron. Well balanced, the refined caramel flavor was sensational along with a slight hint of salt in the background. The all-around contrasting textures of this macaron were also more consistent with my expectations. I would love to get the Salted Caramel Macaron again, but I'm also looking forward to trying the other seasonal flavors.\n\nThe Chocolate Chunk Cookie ($3.25) was not the best, but still highly addictive. This massive cookie was firm, crispy, and fully loaded with semi-sweet chocolate in every bite. I wished the crispy buttery cookie had a softer chew, but the thick crumbly texture did not deter me from eating it all in one setting. I would have enjoyed this cookie more if it could be served warm. \n\nThe item I did not fully enjoy was the Pain au Chocolat ($4). The crisp, ultra flaky, airy and soft textures were impressive, and nicely accompanied by a hint of salt and buttery flavor. However, there were only two tiny strips of chocolate embedded at the bottom of the croissant. To date, Amandine Patisserie still has my favorite Pain au Chocolat.\n\nI also do not recommend the Cinnamon Roll ($4). The layers were too dense, stiff, and cake-like without the yeasty airy dimensions to render that soft gooey cinnamon wow factor.\n\nThe TLC ($3.25) made with pecan, cinnamon, and rolled oats had a one-dimensional earthy flavor without some other ingredients to complicate the overall profile. I tried, but did not finish the cookie.\n\nOverall, their desserts were more buttery than sugary, with impressive level of balance in the flavors and textures across each ingredient. It wasn't necessarily a refined experience in every bite, but there was still plenty to like about their pastries and desserts. Service was to the point and prompt on each of our visits. I hope to return soon to try their Grilled Cheese Sandwich, Kouign-Amann, Thomas Keller Oreo, and Seasonal \u00c9clairs and Tarts."

Once again perfect! \n\nCoffee macaron: my favorite, slightly acidic. Bittersweet butter cream sooo delicious!!\n\nI wholly recommend this place to anyone who has a sweet tooth."

I thought this was going to be a cheap breakfast for us but turns out 2 pastry 2 macaroons and 2 coffees and we're @ $30 so we could've had a sit down breakfast anyway.  \n\nAlso they don't offer iced coffee though it's going to be nearing 100 degrees.\n\nThe patio and Venetian scenery outside is nice but it's also overrun by birds.  There must've been 50+ of them all over the patio."

My husband loves the chocolate bouchons. The lemon meringue tart was ok... i think i prefer jean philippe patisserie in aria for pastries (croissant, brioche)"

            "review": "Hi There, Need to clarify 2 things.. There is a Stand up ' Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian casino level.. And The Cafe Bouchon on the 10th floor of the Palazzo..  seemed great place  to have a breakfast business meeting \n\nbeing ( Neutral) as I call it.. A nice view of the outside patio.. See but don't touch.. ??? It was a GREAT morning.. Patio was closed.OKAYY.. While I was waiting for my client.. I ordered the tray of assorted pastry.. Looked tempting.. But thought rude to start nibbling .. My client  arrived after the usual greetings.. we were both famished..  A very friendly waitress brought us coffee..  perused  though the breakfast menu.. and decided I was in the mood for Classic Bacon /eggs breakfast.. My client decided on the same.. Coffee was good.. We both tasted the Whatever pastry it was supposed to be.. TALKING ABOUT LOOKS BEING DECEIVING! YUCK! it tasted like a rubber toy ! Okay, Maybe it was a mistake.. Let's go on to the next pastry on the well served eye appealing tray.. we cut in half  the almond  something..?!?? UHMM  Other than a few decorative almonds on top of the \"PASTRY\" There was no hint of Chantilly cream.. no almond .. Okay.. Let's move it along.. The pain Au chocolate  I suppose it was to be a classic chocolate croissant.. Was Empty, and dry.. Our eggs arrived.. A bit runny to say the least.. Hey but the coffee was good! We ate the toast and drank 3 cups of coffee .. BTW 2 eggs and a sliver of bacon.. 4\n$ 22.00 each.. I wonder where the chickens came from?  The eggs weren't certainly golden.. ;) The tray of pastry 4 PCs were not for human consumption..  BUT THEY LOOKED GREAT!    If you want a breakfast that looks good.. And your not Hungry.. This is the place to go... ;)) . CIAOO"

As I bit into it, the amazing taste of the apples and sweet crumbs just jumps at you..........and the flaky croissant simply just melts in your mouth......4 bites and the whole thing was gone.\n\nI just came in my pants........the pastries were sooooo satisifying....no sex needed for a few days.\n\nYes, yes, yes......I want more!"

I ordered 2 caramel, 2 raspberry, 1 vanilla and 1 chocolate. I got a nutter butter cookie for my husband.\n\nWe didn't get a chance to eat these until we got back to Austin, but WOW! I'm sad we waited because I would have gone back and ordered MORE, but my thighs are happy I didn't.\n\nThe macaroons were crazy good. Soft, delicate, sweet, crunchy and tender at the same time."

Their confection is bigger than the average macarons. No complaints from this carber -_0\n\nPlus thanks for the hot water (brought my own oolong in the suite). \n\nUpon the initial chomp, the generous raspberry macaron was puffy, chewy, fruity, and creamy. The buttercream oozed out w/each bite - nothing wrong w/that. \n\nI actually prefer buttercream over ganache. But to each their own of course.\n\nTheir espressos are espressos and cupcakes are...you get my point. Hubs just needed a quick shot of caffeine and he's into chocolates. That may be sufficed anywhere. \n\nFocus on their puffed pastries and fritters. \n\nNext time we're in LV I've gotta try their chocolate croissant. They ran out so that triggered my curiosity. Next time Bouchon...next time. \n\n\u00c0 bient\u00f4t ^_^"

It's really hard to find (behind the escalators on your way to the rooms at the Venitian), but definitely worth it. I ordered a variety of baked goods for breakfast including a chocolate croissant, rasberry & chocolate beignets and an assortment of macarons. The chocolate croissant was yummy but nothing compared to the chocolate beignets. They had this pretty chocolate topping and some sort of ganache on the inside - so delicious. The raspberry beignets were also very yummy - definitely not skimping on the raspberry jelly. The macarons were yummy but I should have just ordered the chocolate ones, because there were quite a few in the mixed assortment that I didn't care much for. Overall a very good bakery - I wish I could have came here a few more times while in Vegas to try some of the other baked goods."

My dream is French Laundry but Bouchon Bakery will do for now! LOL.\n\nMy goal was to get my hands on their famous macarons. And yes, they were worth the trip and yes they were massive! At $3.50 per macaron or $17.50 for a box of 6 which included raspberry, caramel, vanilla, coffee, pistachio and chocolate. You can also buy 5 macarons of your choice and get 1 for free which obviously works out to the same price of $17.50 but you get to chose the flavours. Yeah, kinda pricey but macarons are hard to find in my city and a good maracon is even harder to find. I am use to smaller macarons, the Bouchon ones can be the size of a small palm. They are quite delicious - light and crisp exterior but full of flavour inside. My favourite is the pistachio but they're all great so get the box set.\n\nThe madeleine ($1 each) were quite yummy too. But I was disappointed with the croissant ($3.75), it wasn't as buttery as I wanted but very flakey. A surprise yum here was the mocha! OMG, their mocha is absolutely amazing - smooth espresso taste with a not too sweet, not too bitter chocolate. It was $4.75 for a small mocha and it was worth every penny!\n\nThe bakery is in the Venetian, right by the Phantom of the Opera theatre, just around the corner from the Grand Luxe Cafe and under a set of escalators. There's no seating dedicated to the bakery so it's basically a pick up and go place."
