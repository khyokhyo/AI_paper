My pasta was like a glued-together stage-prop!  \n\nThey were very accommodating because they brought us all out fresh food- but that means we had to wait for new food! and we were starving as it was.  The manager apologized and gave us a free bag of cookies.. but we should've received a pretty decent discount based on the fact they screwed up 5/5 entrees- and you just cant run a business like that- not in vegas at least. \n\nThe food is really good and so are the drinks- but I want it right the first time around- we're they all just noobs?  I doubt it."

Remind me of a motherly-figured. \n\n- She brought out soup for my friend and saw that she didn't already have her napkin towel on her laps yet so she kindly did it for her. \n- spoke to us very kindly, respectful\n- followed up literally on everything she recommended. \n- great recommendations (my favorite is chicken pot pie!!!!! I always get this in Vegas)\n- our drinks were never empty \n- reminded us at the end to have a great day, and to have lots of fun!\n- etc....\n\nPalazzo is lucky to have her!"

The prices are not too bad at all ($10-$20) per entree. The best part is it's open 24 hours a day which is awesome because usually only McDonalds or Denny's is open at 4 in the morning. I would come here again!"

            "review": "Let me start by saying the food here is always great!  This is not a review about the food, its about the 18% added gratuity.  I get it delivered to the poker room at the venetian so I dont have a problem with them adding it, infact i usually tip at least 20%.  I only got 1 meal delivered, and when restaurants usually add it, its for like a party of 5 or more.  Ive eaten here quite a few times and never closely looked at the bill til now, when i noticed it.  The wait staff is shady because they dont mention it in hopes that i dont see it and i tip them twice, which is what ive been doing.  So ive been tipping at least 40% each time.  I wonder if the managers know this is how they operate?  People in here throw poker chips around like its nothing, so they dont think twice about it, and usually just pay the bill and assume its right.  Not the way a popular chain like this should do business"

Good service and casual atmosphere, the big portions and generous menu choices make this place an easy pick if you're stuck and can't decide on a place. \nI would recommend the Mediterranean Mahi Mahi and the Shrimp Scampi. \nFor drinks the smoothies are sure to fill your sweet tooth and fruity cravings. I really like the Mango Swirl\nAlso, this place is open 24 hours and is conveniently located in both Venetian and Palazzo. Would definitely recommend!"

            "review": "I adore Grand Luxe. It is one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles and one of my favorites in Las Vegas. I was very surprised that they opened one at the Palazzo, since they have one in the Venetian which is less than a 5 minute walk. \n\nBut regardless, my boyfriend and I havent' been to Grand Luxe in a long time and so we decided to go and have dinner there. We parked at the Venetian and upon entering the Venetian we saw a HUGE line at Grand Luxe. I hate waiting for a long period of time, especially just to eat. So I said, let's go try the one at the Palazzo. I was hoping not many people knew about the second location. I was semi-right!!!\n\nWhen we walked towards the Grand Luxe location at the Palazzo, there were only 2 people in front of me. Once I gave them the number of my party, they sat us immediately. SCORE! No wait! I was a very happy camper indeed.\n\nI ordered my usual Sunday Night Pasta. It was delicious. Slightly a bit too salty for my taste, but still good as I remember it to be. My boyfriend ordered the Lasagna and he LOVED it. I think it is his new favorite item on their menu. He just loved the sauce. I tried it and it was delicious! \n\nAlthough we were stuffed, we saved room for dessert because I am a HUGE Creme Brulee fanatic and hadn't had it in such a long time. So we ordered that and it was also delicious. You get one regular vanilla creme brulee and one chocolate flavored creme brulee. When you eat it together, it's just so yummy in your tummy!!\n\nOur waiter was also very nice and helpful. So service was good too.\n\nI love Grand Luxe!! I had so much leftovers. Portion size is HUGE! So many choices and so much good food!!!"

There were plenty of options for an inexpensive dinner and while the dinner rolls were average, the pork sliders and margherita pizza we got were delicious!  The sliders tasted absolutely gourmet!  Plus the pizza was enough for two people while still maintaing a high quality.\n\nThis place not being named after a mass production facility and its much more tasteful decor made it much better than a cheesecake factory for me."

The hosts greeted us with smiles.\n\nThe menu was immense; they have so much different food here that I was a little worried. Whenever I see a lot of items on a menu I wonder about the quality, but I was SO pleasantly surprised!\n\nThe food: We ordered Spring rolls for starters; they were delish! My husband ordered the rib eye steak and he loved it.  I ordered the salmon cooked three ways; it was fabulous. We couldn't fit in dessert, but I have no doubt that would have been awesome too.\n\nThe best part was the service. Our waitress, Erica (I believe that was her name), was SO great! She knew so much about the food and answered all of our questions. She was friendly and gave us great service all the way.\n\nOur bill came to a little over $80, and that was with a generous tip. I would totally go back to Grand Lux. I've spent much more money in Las Vegas on food; this place is a gem and you get everything you pay for. For the quality of food and service, $80 is cheap in my book."

I laugh because my friends always go lets go to Grand Lux because it's cheap there, then we never really get out paying less than $20 a person for just the meal no drinks, lol.  Yeah it's cheap for Vegas, but when you eat here for late dinner everynight (3am or so) it adds up for just drunkie food, lol.  If you've only got a half hour to dine, call ahead to order because the service isn't that quick."

Just walk past the Palazzo waterfall and before you hit the escalator make a right.\n\nCan't wait to go back. Great service and wonderful food. Nice plating and clean. This is so so so so so much better the Cheese Cake Factory. So much better!\n\nLoved all of it:\n\nhttp://www.grandluxcafe.com/menu.htm\n\nCajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya \nSauteed with Peppers, Onions and Tasso in a Delicious Spicy Sauce. \nServed with White Rice. Never had such soft chicken. It was so tender and the rice was cooked right. I was so surprised that this was made so well. I felt like the kitchen was really serious about their food.\n\nChicken Royale and Short Ribs\nSo good. Short Ribs were amazingly tender, like moist, juicy, and meaty. It was one of the best short ribs ever. Chicken was ok. \n\nMolten Chocolate Cake \nWith a Melted Chocolate Center. Served with Vanilla Ice Cream\nSo good. What a good amount of dessert for less than $10! It was a really good dessert dish.\n\nI felt the kitchen was really good. I think they must have a really good chef. And the waiter was super nice. I was so pleased with this meal. This is probably one of the best cafes I have tried on the Las Vegas strip. Price was reasonable and food was delicious."

We tried to take them out while we're eating, but it's too much. Then we stopped and let the server know about that. They sent someone to talk with us before they took it out from my check. The first thing this guy question us is if we know the lettuce. ( of course! We knew the lettuce and we also know fresh and spoil vegetable). Next, I started my burger. I cut and eat my burger. I suddenly saw the blue green chemical stain on my plate where I just cut my first bite. I stopped again and asked for the check. We didn't say anything until we paid. Then I told the server about the chemical stain. I felt very pissed this time when he reply me. \"I think it might be the dishwasher chemical\", he said. He doesn't seem sorry or any thing about my food was sit on the chemical and I ate it. In my opinion, i own 4 restaurant in town.  I don't think the dishwasher wouldn't leave the stain like that. I think it might be some cleaning product or something when they spray nearby the plate because my lip and my cheek feel numb right away while i's driving back home. In short, this cafe wouldn't be my favorite restaurant anymore."

What I like about this place is that it's open 24 hours, and serves DELICIOUS FOOD, something I find is very rare in a 24 hour establishment.  \n\nThere's a long story about this restaurant, a sister-restaurant of the Cheesecake Factory (another favorite of mine)!  Apparently, when the Venetian was being built, they wanted to put a Cheesecake Factory there.  But, due to the fact that there's already a Cheesecake Factory \"a few blocks down the strip\" at the Caesar's Forum Shops, and the Cheesecake Factory wouldn't allow another location just blocks away from another Cheesecake Factory.  So, the developer of the Venetian negotiated a deal to open a very similar restaurant, but with a different name and menu.  I'm so glad they did that!  \n\nFavorite items here include the fried chicken and waffles (ask for regular maple syrup, instead of the \"maple butter sauce\" that normally comes with it), and their Indochine chicken and shrimp, amazing flavors and ingredients make this a delicious choice!  Oh, and order a box of their freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, they run circles around Mrs. Fields or any other cookies I've ever purchased, they taste exactly like the Tollhouse cookies my mother used to make from the recipe on the back of Nestle Chocolate Chips, so delicious, and tastes like they use real butter and the same ingredients you'd use if you were making cookies from scratch (not the preservatives, high fructose corn syrups, margerine or other \"crappy ingredients\" in the ready to bake cookie dough in supermarkets.  I get these every time I'm in Vegas!  \n\nDefinitely one of, if not the best, 24 hour restaurants I've ever been to!  And I've probably tried this place a dozen or so times, food is always excellent!  I haven't found any other 24 hour restaurants in Vegas (or anywhere else, except maybe Los Angeles) that are worth eating at!  Try this place, I'm sure you'll be glad you did!"

American, European, Asian food is laid out to bare.  After finally deciding that it was probably a good idea to not bomb myself to death since I was going to Marquee later that night, I settled on the shaking beef and caramel chicken combo platter with some roast beef cheese fries.  Beef was cooked very well, chicken was tasty.  The quality of the ingredients was top notch, you know you're getting freshness here.  Typical large Cheesecake Factory portions.  Obviously not the cheapest, but it's no more expensive than a regular Cheesecake Factory and it's about on par with affordable Las Vegas Strip dining.\n\nJust like Cheesecake Factory, if you want to have a good meal and not feel ripped off, Grand Lux is definitely the spot to go.  Whether I'd come here for the sole purpose of eating here is another matter, since I only came because I was staying at Palazzo.  But if I had to placate everyone in a party, I'd probably take this."

The Venetian also has a Grand Lux, but THIS IS NOT part of my review.\n\nMy fiance and I had a great time at Las Vegas until we come to this facility for lunch.  I come to GLC at The Palazzo also because we stay here for the weekend and wanted to grab something to eat nearby.  I was served by someone who did not give clear explanation to what I ordered.  My fiance order orange juice (non-refillable) for $5.50!!  The brunch menu she ordered was reasonably price at $10 for hashbrown, scrambled egg, toast and ham.  However, when I thought it suppose to come with sausage and when I asked, the waitress brought us a separate plate of sausage...  but I did not know it was an additional side order cost of $5.95!!  My lunch came out to be $41 for two!!  It may not seem a lot, but consider I ordered waffle with strawberries ($11) and coffee ($4) for myself, this is one expensive lunch.  I will never forget the price of a glass of orange juice (champagne glass) costed me $5.50!!!  NOT TO MENTION, the service was slow and was absent at times.\n\nI would recommend going to the GLC at The Venetian instead.  At least I did get service for the same price.\n\nNote:  I have gone to GLC at The Venetian many times and have enjoyed the food and service at this facility."

Had the option to upgrade to their breakfast buffet for $8.50 per person and did.  There were 8 persons in our group and everyone enjoyed the buffet.  The orange juice was freshly squeezed, oat meal freshly made, and the eggs, ham, waffles, bacon, sausage, fruit, hash browns.........everything was delicious.  For $8.50 per person, it was a bargain.  I understand that the regular charge for the buffet is $16.  So if you are staying at the Venetian/Palazzo for your stay in Las Vegas, be sure to ask them to include the complimentary breakfast buffet."

            "review": "I'm a little torn about this place now. Had I reviewed it a couple years ago, it would have been all positive, however, so much has changed. I've been dining at Grand Lux Cafe consistently since they opened until a couple years ago (I had previously frequented the Venetian location). Granted, I didn't frequent as often in the last 2-3 years since Las Vegas' local restaurant scene has stepped up and I found new, better spots to obsess. But, it was my visit in September 2013 that turned me away. The quality has diminished significantly and dishes that were once favorites, are now very disappointing! Also, food portions have gotten smaller and prices have remained the same (or increased). Where's the money going?\n\nOne of my favorite sections of their menu is the Grand Salads. Large portions for around $13-17. My favorites are the Southwestern Salad and the Manhattan Salad. They've changed the Manhattan Salad a bit since I first had it a few years ago, but it's still good. I like the fresh beets and the large assortment of fresh vegetables and legumes; plus, the house vinaigrette is great. The last time I had this salad, however, it was oddly NOT chopped. Maybe someone got lazy that day? I'd hate to think that it's just served like that now. View photos below:\n\nExhibit A: Manhattan Salad in August 2014 (What a chopped salad should look like). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=N_rprbjxzdz2HNz-25Bkfg#N_rprbjxzdz2HNz-25Bkfg\n\nExhibit B: Manhattan Salad in October 2014 (This is what I was served just two months later). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=aCNz4-XJiHTb6KoH7KTcMA#aCNz4-XJiHTb6KoH7KTcMA\n\nI haven't tried a lot of their newer Small Salads, but they used to serve a really nice Spicy Calamari Salad. Delicious and crispy calamari and fresh greens with these two wonderful sauces/dressing. It's a shame that it's no longer on the menu. \n\nOther dishes that I've enjoyed: Empanadas, Buffalo Chicken Bites, Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls, Buffalo Chicken Rolls, Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Rolls, Pasta Pomodoro, Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya, and Indochine Shrimp & Chicken.\n\nOh, their New Orleans Beignets are fantastic! They're made to order, so you'll need to order in the beginning of your meal. They have a great batter and I love the sauces: Jack Daniels Creme Anglaise, Raspberry, and Chocolate. The creme anglaise is magic and I love mixing it with the tart raspberry sauce. It's divine.\n\nTheir burgers are good (or at least they were good the last time I had them). Thick, juicy Angus burgers that are cooked to order (medium rare, yay!). I've also enjoyed their sandwiches. My go-to sandwich used to be the Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich. I ordered this staple again during my visit in December and it was TERRIBLE. I just don't understand what's going on! I've had this sandwich multiple times and there have never been any issues. The sandwich was messily assembled and there was NO flavor. I think they may changed the mayo (website shows black bean mayo?) because I'm pretty sure it used to have a spicy element that gave it zing. They should probably rename the sandwich and take out the word 'spicy' because now the only \"spicy\" ingredient is the pepper jack cheese.\n\nMore disappointment: Their fries used to be so great and now they're horrible! Also, I recently tried another one of my go-to favorites, Chicken Pot Pie, and it has strayed so far from what it used to be. Such a shame.\n\nI just had the Kale and Avocado Salad (Fresh kale, avocado, spicy roasted poblano chiles, black beans, feta cheese, onions, toasted pumpkin seeds, and citrus vinaigrette) on my most recent visit last month and it was fantastic! I couldn't believe how great it was after so many disappointments recently. It has restored a little faith.\n\nI doubt I'll attempt any of my old favorites again in fear of more disappointment, but I do still like GLC's salad selection. I'm just hoping the next time I order a Manhattan Salad, that it is indeed chopped."

Awesome service!  \n\nI had the Lemon Drop Martini which was perfectly sweet and had just the right amount of alcohol.  \n\nWe ordered the fried calamari which included shrimp and some veggies.  A very generous serving accompanied by 2 dipping sauces.   The batter was not too thin nor too thick.  It wasn't greasy and was very tasty.  \n\nWe also ordered the cheese and BBQ chicken pizza.  I didn't get to try it but it was all gone so need I say more?\n\nHubby and I shared the Beef Wellington.  We've never had this dish anywhere and were so used to seeing it prepared on Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen, so when they came out as medallions with a pastry puff sitting on top, we were a little disappointed but they were still really delicious!   I'm not a brussel sprouts eater but I loved the way they were prepared!  It was charred and topped with a sweet glaze.  Veggies and mashed potatoes were paired with it.  \n\nNo room for dessert but I'd love to come back!"

A few of us (three in total) went here for breakfast on a Friday morning and it was pretty packed.  We got seated in 10-15 minutes but the service was pretty slow.  Our waitress didn't come to our table until a long while later and wasn't very good with topping off our waters, bummer.  But the food was very good, their bacon was done well, nice thick cut cooked crisp but yet a little tender.  Then there was the omelet, which my friend loved, eggs were done almost perfectly.  I had the corned beef hash.  This was their homemade corned beef and I think this is the first time that I would probably say this but, I think I would have preferred it if they processed it more.  It was nice but it was too thick and fibrous.  It's not your typical corned beef hash, it's definitely chunkier and more of a mouthful to handle.  It was OK but I would probably have ordered something else next time.  I saw our neighbors and one guy had a massively delicious looking french toast. \n\nEither way, it was a very nice atmosphere for breakfast, breakfast was hearty and filling, the food was prepared well but their corned beef hash fell short and their service was lacking for a place like this.  Oh, they also have a \"buffet\" side of the restaurant because this is Vegas after all..."

There were 5 of us and it took a few minutes to get seated as usual.\nFood- very good and generally fair priced for a casino restaurant. I ordered one of my favs - the Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich and substituted white rice for fries. Short rib was cooked perfectly and the sandwich is just amazing. I wish it was a tad bit bigger but its ok. The rice came out nice and hot and was a great compliment to my sandwich instead of fries. ***side note: i'm so over french fries... every once in a while I'll give in but they just do nothing for me anymore*** \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Caramel Chicken dish to split with a friend. They loved it and I tried some and it was really good.\n\nOur server, while very friendly, kept disappearing for a while. The only problem I have with Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux is that they are so big that when its busy the servers are insanely hard to get a hold of. Bread took a while to come out and then wasn't hot when it came out. He apologized saying he had to wait for it but if he had to wait for it shouldn't it be hot? just curious\n\nOverall a great meal and I will for sure go back. The food is good and reliable. Yet to have a bad experience at either."

We looked up reviews and even skipped a bunch of places on the strip in search of a good sit down meal and walked here all the way from The Cosmo with high hopes...let's just say those hopes were shot down, kicked, and stomped on. Violently. The fact that they have good reviews is baffling. I admit it was after some drinks, but I actually wish I was more drunk so that I didn't notice the terrible food and service. The front hostesses were helpful in seating us, but it was in a darker corner away from any foot traffic of servers, and it wasn't even that busy...mind you, there were only two of us. Our server, Jesus Jimenez took awhile to greet us and took even longer to take our orders. I don't eat meat so when I asked him if there were any other options besides the fish and chips and pricey salads he just responded, \"no\". I wasn't looking for a gourmet option, but at least show some empathy. Little do I know, that would be the least of our problems. Right when we were going to get up and leave he finally came without any apologies. Like, can I get some bread or something to hold us over? Nada. Fine, just give us our food. 30 minutes later I had wish we did ask for bread. When the food came, it was a poor excuse of jambalaya that looked like a college kid had made it and questionable ahi tuna that I probably should not have ingested, but we were so hungry at that point, we ate it anyway. After the meal, it took another 30 minutes for someone to check on us, so by that time we just wanted our bill and get the hell out of there. Just when we thought we were free of the terrible service, there was more. Our server informed us as we were handing over our card to pay that the system was down and that we needed to go to the ATM. Why would you wait until after all the waiting to tell us this?! The temptation of dining and ditching sounded so amazing at that point, but I was too sober to get myself to do it- probably due to the adrenalin and anger of our horrible dining experience.\n\nSo, if you're looking for somewhere to go for some late night eats, go somewhere else. You're better off grabbing some Earl of Sandwich and calling it a night. The service is terrible and the food is worse...unless you're looking for somewhere to sober up immediately, then this is the place to go."

So from now on, I'm going to pretend this is not a sister restaurant and move on with my life. This is going to be a repressed thought forever and there's no changing that. \n\nMy boyfriend and I arrived in Vegas at almost 10 pm last Friday night after battling traffic nearly the whole way there. So after walking around from restaurant to restaurant on the mall floor of the Venetian that all closed at 10 pm, we were told that downstairs we would find Grand Lux which is open 24/7. We both sort of grumbled and figured we would be dining on fast food and excessive amounts of alcohol to make up for the lack of good cuisine. \n\nMuch to our surprise, Grand Lux is actually a really awesome spot. Service was top-notch, our food was fantastic and the margaritas are legit. They're not like lime kool-aid tasting with maybe a hint of tequila. My boyfriend and I are margarita aficionados to the extreme. Actually, I've turned him into a margarita monster and now he orders them at all times, even when they're utterly inappropriate. \n\nFor me, I kept within the Mexican theme and ordered the flautas. Holy shit, they're so light and fluffy on the outside yet still have a nice crunch when you bite in them - and the roasted veggies on the inside were cooked to perfection. You know how sometimes roasted veggies turn into mush or amalgamate into something that tastes like burned baby food? Well, not here. They were superb. I don't remember what my boyfriend ate... Not at all. Probably because I was too busy having a mouthgasm over the flautas. Combined with their cadillac margi... Hello, perfection. \n\nWhen I'm in Vegas again I'll probably be coming here more than once. or more than twice. or maybe just eat here for every meal until I get sick of them. This is probably the best chain I've ever been to."

I've been to the Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 that used to be in LA but that location has been closed down. \n\nThe customer service is really good. Our sever was really nice and attentive. My sister ordered their veggie burger but doesn't like onions, so she said she didn't want onions and the manager came out to double check she wasn't allergic to them because they add onions to the veggie patty, which was nice of them. \n\nI ordered a veggie wrap and it was pretty decent. I added the buffalo sauce though and it made the wrap exceptionally better. \n\nThis is one of the places where I'd go back if there was nothing better. It's good but not amazing."

With so many restaurants to choose from, we still ate at the Grand Lux once everyday, which allowed us to try breakfast and lunch at the Grand Lux Palazzo, and dinner at the Grand Lux Venetian - it was that good! Really! In fact, if you consider \"value for money\", I think it can't be beat anywhere in Vegas.\n\nThe service is wonderful, attentive and friendly. The ambiance is what you would expect for a hotel as nice as the Palazzo or the Venetian, yet the atmosphere is very unassuming and not at all stuffy, like either Batali's or Lagasse's restaurants. And the prices are very reasonable for such high quality food!\n\nBetween us we tried the Grand Lux breakfast sandwich (served all day in case you missed breakfast, as I did), regular ol' eggs, bacon, toast (done perfectly with bacon that was crispy and not greasy, baked perhaps?) and the breakfast buffet (we both enjoyed it, but my wife thought there should have been more variety). \n\nJust days before visiting Vegas, I had been reminiscing about enjoying Sloppy Joe's as a kid, so when I saw it on the Grand Lux menu, I had to try it. It was made, I believe, with rib meat instead of hamburger, and served on brioche bread instead of a bun, with fries. I told my wife that it was the best Sloppy Joe I have ever had!\n\nMy wife ate a mushroom pasta dish which she enjoyed and I munched on some buffalo chicken rolls that were absolutely wonderful! The pasta was delicious and she regretted being unable to take it home and put the leftovers in the fridge. Portion size is always more than enough. The chicken rolls were made out of chicken breast (done perfectly), placed into spring roll covers, with cheese, then deep fried, served with wonderful buffalo dipping sauce. Wow! \n\nI washed the chicken rolls down with a couple glasses of Texas Tea (think Long Island). Unlike the food, drinks will set you back some, but it was worth it for at least one celebratory evening.\n\nOh, and because it is a Cheesecake Factory restaurant (yes, it really is!), we shared a piece of white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, and you know how good that must have been - and it was. Yum! \n\nBTW, the menu is definitely different from Cheesecake Factory, although you will still find some of your favorites there, if that is what you are looking for. \n\nSo, if you are staying anywhere on the Las Vegas strip, do yourself a favor and take the time to eat at the Grand Lux restaurant in either the Palazzo or Venetian. You will NOT be sorry!"

The potato pierogi with short ribs, mushrooms and onions immediately caught my eye. But, alas, the server informed me they were out. They make them from scratch and once they're out, they're out. So I ordered a gnocchi dish. But they were out of that too.\n\nI finally settled on the Sicilian pasta which the server assured me was available. It had chunks of Italian sausage.

The menu gets 5 stars. \n\nI would rate the food here as being in the 3 star to 5 star range depending on what you order.  The breakfast omelets are excellent as are the burgers, wraps and many of the sandwiches I have tried.  Things like the pancakes were average and nothing to write home about.   \nThe service was a bit off the last two visits with me having to flag down a server to get coffee, creamer, water refills and even simple stuff like ketchup.  Despite that the food and meal was still good.  \n\nOverall this is a great place to \"grab a bite\" or perhaps also a drink as they do have a full bar.  However, this isn't a romantic experience or even a \"real nice\" dining experience that will be memorable for years.  This is a casual \"fill my stomach\" experience.

Grand Lux is a safe pick for a meal because the menu is extensive and the food is pretty good. Service is usually good as well. \n\nThis was my first visit to the Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 inside the Palazzo. Our waitress was the best. She asked us if we were from out of town. We responded that we weren't and were mainly here for the beignets.  She gave us a tip that it would take about 20 minutes to make and that she'll alert the kitchen when we were about halfway through our meals.  I had their turkey burger and a dry baked potato. Overall, my meal was just okay. Now, back to the beignets. You get 8 large sized beignets in a basket. The beignets are served fresh, hot, and lightly coated with powdered sugar.  I'm not even going to try to describe how good these beignets are.  But I tell you what...they're pretty close to Caf\u00e9 du Monde minus the powdery mess.

I dined here twice on my recent trip to Vegas, as I stayed at the Palazzo. It is a quick and convenient restaurant to have inside a hotel. \n\nMy first visit was for take out. I ended up getting a lunch portion of their half BLT with a soup and salad. It was A LOT of food. Portions here are HUGE. The chicken tortilla soup was very tasty and very filling. I could tell there was a lot of sodium though, which is expected. There was so much bacon in the BLT and I am not one to waste bacon, but I just couldn't eat it all. Salad was ok. The balsamic dressing was odd but tasty I guess. Even though I tried to get something \"healthy\", I still felt very bloated after. Obviously all the sodium.\n\nFor dinner on my last night, I got the chicken parm. WOW. This chicken parm was bigger than my face. The waiter did try to warn me on the portion but I didn't think it was going to be THAT big. I ended up eating only a quarter of it and took the rest home on the plane. It actually wasn't even that good, but I didn't want to waste it. It was also too salty. Not enjoyable. Our waiter that night was very friendly. I wish I remembered his name. His customer service was excellent and the way he treated all customers was very respectable.\n\nI probably won't stay at the Palazzo again, which means I probably won't go out of my way to eat here again either.

It is a little pricey, but the food is pretty good and although it does say cafe in their name it's more of a nice sit down Restaraunt (think cheesecake factory). My BF and I ordered the chicken and waffles and pasta carbonara, which were both really good. The portions are pretty big, so come hungry!"

Great sauce, nice veggies.  My wife had the waffles.  Really great syrup, she wants to bottle it and bring it home.  \n\nWe also had breakfast here the next day.  Small, but nice buffet selection.

            "review": "I ate here for breakfast twice while I was staying at the Palazzo. They have two Grand Lux Cafes, one at the Venetian and one at Palazzo. This review is obviously for the Palazzo. The Grand Lux is from the makers of the Cheesecake Factory. The decor, the outfits, even the to-go bag look just like the ones you would see at Cheesecake Factory, except the restaurant name has been changed. Also, the menu is just as big. I ordered the chicken and waffles one day and the scrambled eggs with hash browns on another day. Both were excellent. Waffle was crisp on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. It came with a maple syrup which wasn't too sweet, which is perfect for me. I don't like syrups that overpower the flavor of the waffle. The waffle was also topped with pecans. The chicken was not your ordinary chicken strips, it was very good, white meat chicken strips. Lightly season and breaded on the outside, fried to a crisp and very juicy on the inside. The salty and sweet combination of the chicken and waffles is an amazing combination. For those of you that haven't tried it, you might think it's crazy, and I did too, until you try it. Do yourself a favor and try it!\n\nThe second day I had scrambled eggs with hash browns, which comes with your choice of toast. The eggs were perfect, not too runny, not too dry. The hash browns were nice and crisp and not too oily. Both the waffle and eggs were pretty big too, very cheesecake-esque and although the meals are a bit pricey, it's a lot of food too. \n\nWe didn't have to wait more than 5 mins to get seated on either day. Day one was Friday morning at 8:30am, and Saturday was at 10am. The restaurant looks pretty big, so I think that helps alleviate congestion. The also offer an all you can eat buffet for breakfast, but I'm not a big eater in the morning, so I stuck to the menu. \n\nI went to breakfast with my brother and he ordered the Continental Breakfast, which is for $8.95 and it comes with a bowl of assorted fruit pieces, a small croissant, 1 muffin and 1 danish. The croissant, muffin and danish look like something you would get at a gas station convenience store and also tasted that way. I would highly recommend that you stay away from the Continental Breakfast. He only chose it because it was free as part of his room rate. He was staying as part of an American Express Fine Hotels and Resort rate. Check out my pictures for prices on each item!"

But I like it! The broth is lemongrass flavored (not beef) and they use chicken. You add bean sprouts and spinach and ask for sriracha and you just made yourself a healthy pho! The broth is sour so don't expect a beef flavored. And you don't really need sriracha but I love it spicy. It's a really good spin on pho. My GFs and I always get this late at night! Since grand Lux is open 24 hours, we eat here after clubbing. \n\nYou don't know how many times zen noodles saved me from a nasty hangover!"

The smoke from the casino is not nearly as bothersome as compared to the Venetian.  \n\nAll the food we've tried there are very yummy!  My favorite tapas are the Asian Short Rib Tacos and the BBQ Pork Sliders.  The Grand Lux burger melt and avocado chipotle cheeseburger are delicious!  There are other dishes on the menu that we've had, and we have never been disappointed with any of the choices. \n\nMake sure to save room for dessert.  Our favorite is the New Orleans beignets which comes with three different dipping sauces (chocolate, vanilla, and raspberry).  Order the beignets when you give your entree order cause it takes about 30 minutes to make the beignets.\n\nThey are a bit pricey, but worth it and the staff is usually good also.\n\nWe will keep coming back here everytime we visit Vegas."

I ordered the spicy flat bread chicken sandwhich with a side of fries & a white wine sangria.\n\nThe flat bread sandwhich came with  pepper jack cheese, lettuce, chicken, avocado, & the flat bread was doughy & soft yummy!\nThe fries were ok but not so great & the sangria was really good & refreshing. The food came in handy because of the huge portion for late night port partying eats.\n\nAlso the last day we were there after all the damage done to our livers I ordered the lunch salad & pasta special...the salad was light & came with balsamic vinaigrette & the pasta I chose was the pasta carbonara. It came with carbonara sauce, cheese, pancetta, & peas it was soo tasty!!! It even tasted even better when I got home that day for dinner that night..for sure I will come to eat here the next time I take a Vegas trip."

The decor is quite similar and maybe some of the dishes are comparable, but the prices are a bit steeper.\n\nSince it was kinda late morning, I was still in the mood for breakfast.  I ordered an all meat omelette and some coffee.  The waiter was quite attentive as my coffee and water was always topped up.\n\nWhen my food came, I couldn't believe the omelette that came from this place.  The egg looked like a sheet if yellow plastic wrapping around chopped pieces of meat.  It looked like they were cooked separately rather than together as it should be.  After a few bites, I couldn't take it anymore and had to tell the waiter this was unacceptable.  It was also missing the shredded cheddar and he recognized it.  When the new omelette came out, it actually looked like egg this time.  The sad part is that I'm not too stuffed to eat any of it and wasn't about to take this home or back to the room.  \n\nI give the service 5 stars, but the restaurant 3 stars.  The meat was quite delish, but how can you screw up an omelette AND forget the cheese?"

The burgers are great, kobe meatballs are fantastic! Truth is, I can't imagine anything not being good. When our family visits they beg us to take us there. Service is always great and Jeremy wrote Happy Birthday to my husband in strawberry syrup on our warm butter cake dessert! \n\nOh and yes they are owned by the Cheesecake Factory, but that does not mean they are anything alike...as a matter of fact, we strongly dislike the Cheesecake Factory and can't recall having a decent meal there--ever.

We stayed at the Palazzo, so, partly out of convenience, partly out of curiosity, we did dinner at Grand Lux one night. JP got the Jamaican Pork Tenderloin, my memory tells me JC got the reuben but I can't find it on the menu, not quite remembering what JL got, KL had the Asian Nachos, BT went for the Chicken Pot Pie, and I had the Madeira Chicken. I only got around to trying JP's and BT's dishes in addition to mine. The Jamaican pork was really good. It comes with rice, mashed sweet potatoes, and mango salsa. Hearty. If there's one criticism, maybe it was a bit salty. The chicken pot pie was the biggest. pot. pie. EVER. The area of the crust was as big as both my hands together. Ok, so I have midget hands. But still! Creamy. Delish. My Madeira Chicken served with mashed potatoes and asparagus was perfect. I'm always a fan of any creamy wine sauce. Mashed potatoes equals comfort. Asparagus equals love. It's nothing super fancy, just exactly what my taste buds were asking for.\n\nFast forward to one day later. We had been up till 9am playing blackjack and were running on no sleep. Slightly dejected after losing a fair amount of money, but mostly needing showers, we went back up to our room to shower and get ready for checkout, then JP, JC, JC2, BT, TC, and I had our last lunch at Grand Lux. Not remembering what everyone had this time. I'll venture to say the DeLux Drive-In Burger, Grand Club, and the Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich were among the choices. Definitely not remembering what JP got. She was too preoccupied with getting back to the blackjack tables. so JP is huddled in the corner struggling to stay awake, conflicted between her desire to take a nap and her significantly more urgent need to get back to the tables. I ordered the Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich, which was excellent. A chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato, kicked up with pepper jack and avocado-corn salsa. I want to say it was one giant sandwich cut into quarters, but it was really four still-giant sandwiches. Before I got to my second sandwich, JP had already finished whatever she ordered, threw her credit card down on the table for us to pay with, and ran back to the casino. By herself. Addict.\n\nIn the past, I've also had the Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls, Lemon Chicken Piccata, and Banana Cream Pie, all of which I would recommend. I've always had great service, the atmosphere is great, and it's just the kind of place you want to be. Comfortable and consistent. Unfortunately there aren't as many pictures as usual, as I was too preoccupied with my meal companion or we were too concerned with getting back to the blackjack tables, but there are a few that will hopefully suffice. In summary, it's simple, nothing absolutely crazy gourmet, but definitely hits the spot and more than satisfactory. Huge portions and so good! Yummers!!!!"

Parking and walking from the Venetian is such a hassle, while if you know where to park at palazzo it'll take you up right by grand lux. \nThe restaurant is appropriately named - the decor is both grand and lux especially for what is basically a casino coffee shop. High open ceilings with lots of mirrors and other shinies, comfy seats and always very clean w great service every time. \nI don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like, but I usually stick to my favs. Its hard for me to resist my sunday night pasta - its spaghetti with a meat sauce made up of a lot of different things. Meant to be like a dish where you throw all of the week's leftovers together (but made fresh) its packed with short ribs, hamburger, sausage, mushrooms and I'm sure other things I forgot about. The portion's huge, easily 2 maybe 3 meals especially if you fill up on their warm crusty bread and butter. I'm embarrassed to admit that our basket always needs a refill :)\nOther things worth mentioning - duck pot stickers, shrimp w pasta, short rib grilled cheese, their burger w short ribs on top. We're usually too stuffed to get dessert but I finally remembered this time to plan ahead and order the warm rustic apple pie. It's baked to order so takes 20 minutes, I'd suggest putting it in with your dinner order. Even if you forget to order ahead of time, it's well worth the wait. As you can see in the picture its really more of an apple tart. Warm flaky pastry crust, sweet but slightly tart apple slices, topped with vanilla ice cream and finished with powdered sugar. I'd go back just for that pie. \nGive grand lux a try if you've never been. Their massive menu is guaranteed to have something that everyone will like."

With a 60 minute dinner break, I barely had enough time to eat my dinner, even though I ran from the tournament to the restaurant to put in my order.  Consistently, my food didn't show up until 40 minutes after I had ordered, leaving me 20 minutes to scarf down my food and pay.  Consistently they couldn't even get a basket of fucking bread to me in the first half hour of my arrival.  That's just ridiculous.\n\nI came back once after the poker tournament series was over, thinking it would be better since it wasn't so slammed.  I ordered a salad and a main course.  I sat there forever, asking twice for a basket of bread.  First thing to arrive?  My main course.  WHAT THE FUCK I HATE THAT!  I told the waiter to cancel my salad, who wanted to argue with me that he tried to warn me that the salad would take forever.  No, I asked which appetizer comes out the quickest since I'm starving, and he said they all take the same amount of time.

Breakfast (a great omelet), lunch (soup and sandwich combo), dinner (asian noodles), and late night  (one of the best hamburgers ever). The service is also very good. Be warned that the portions are giant, but this adds to the economy of the place: if you share, it's even cheaper. Desserts are also excellent."

I usually get here during the early hours of the morning, before heading back to my room. They have ample choices on their breakfast menu but I strongly recommend the Breakfast Buffet, I always get the custom made omelet, just the way I like it. I simply pair it with the Mimosas and it's a perfect end to a fantastic night in Vegas. You might run into a celebrity here... you never know!"

We asked the hostess if our reservation was still available and she said yes!  We were so excited we made it on time, yet after that, we had to wait because I heard the hostess mumbled to another girl that \"She totally forgot\" about our group -__-.  How do you forget if people made reservations?  We had to wait about 5 minutes and was then seated.  Our waiters were attentive with our group of 8 people.  This is a higher end than Cheesecake Factory and beware, when you look at the menu, it is massive which will make you very indecisive!!  I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the \n\nTomato and Fresh Mozzarella \nCherry Tomatoes, Garlic, Mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan Cheeses. This was only $5.95.  I asked if they could add basil on it as well and they were kind enough to do that and it was the perfect size for little me!\n\nSeafood Salad \nLump Crab, Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Corn, Green Beans, Egg, Celery and Green Onion Over a Bed of Crisp Romaine Tossed with Our \"Louis\" Dressing.  I had some of my friends salad and this was super refreshing and filling!\n\nPotato Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce \nSimply Delicious Housemade Gnocchi Tossed in Our Creamy Vodka Sauce and Fresh Basil.  Omg this was delicious....after a few bites!  I recommend ordering this but please SHARE with all the people at your table!  It can get kind of sickening after a few bites because it is so rich!!\n\nAsian Pear Martini \nAbsolut Vanilia Vodka, Pear, Passion Fruit and Sake. Great martini if you want something refreshing and sweet!  A little pricey though...about $13.\n\nOverall, great place to eat with a  variety of choices!!  \n\nNOTE:\n-Opened late for all you drunkies ;)\n-5 minute grace period if you happen to be a tad late"

The bartender even noticed that my hubby and I were waiting forever at the bar and decided to check up on it.  When I brought the burger back upstairs to my suite, the burger was charred on one side.  I had asked that they make the burger medium well.  It was well done and charred.  So I called the manager from my room and asked if they could redo the burger.  When I showed him the burger he said it was suppose to be that way... WTF? Really, so when a customer orders a burger medium well, it is suppose to be burned and crunchy on one side???!!!  Yeah right!   They brought me a new burger and it was better, medium well like I had asked.  \n\nOne star for inconveniencing me not once, but three times (long wait, burger not cooked to order, and having to make a trip back to get a new burger).

The Grand Lux has plenty of seating and I've rarely seen it to be busy.\n\nThe menu is huge featuring a wide array of salads, sandwiches, and unique entrees from a variety of cuisines.

Among the family we ordered three pasta dishes, fish and chips, and fried chicken. \n\nWe also had the calamari appetizer which comes with fried shrimp, onions, and zucchini (the latter only nominally, buy if I am ordering calamari I would rather they skimp on the zucchini than the calamari). It was really tasty and the portion was large enough that my family of five was all able to get a decent portion.\n\nBack to the main courses, I had the fried chicken, which is usually what you will find me ordering if I is on a menu. The seasoning appears to be a simple  salt and pepper base, and it was done to perfection. Crispy on the outside, moist in the inside, not too much batter, and good flavor. It was half of a chicken with the breast deboned but the other pieces bone in. Mashed potatoes were reminiscent of CF.\n\nAll of the rest of the family loved their dishes as well. The only problem is that we didn't have a refrigerator at our hotel so we couldn't take our leftovers!"

Definitely delicious, but condensed milk would have topped off the beignets well. The chocolate and raspberry toppings were artificial tasting to me, but I am personally not fond of those flavors on a normal day.

We did not have to wait more than 3 minutes to be seated either day, even though only half of our group had arrived... and they continued to wander in throughout the meal.\n\nI enjoyed Joe's Scramble on my first morning... delicious and so much of it! I felt like I had just as much food as on the buffet the next morning. In fact, most of my group ordered off of the menu on that first visit, and everyone commented on the huge portions. While the buffet does offer an omelet station, I wasn't impressed with it, nor the buffet, especially not for the price of more than $20. The omelet line was very long & I was rather hungry so I found other things to eat from the buffet instead of waiting in line. The available buffet food was very good... but simply not much of a selection. If we'd gone to breakfast for a 3rd time, I would've ordered from the menu again... that Joe's Scramble was fantastic!"

The offer a all you can eat breakfast buffet for $17.99 and includes fresh squeeze orange juice and coffee, there is an omelet station, and a variety of favorite breakfast items. They are open 24 hours, so you can have breakfast, lunch or dinner, and of course a full bar. One day we woke up late of course, after a night of really hard parting Vegas style,and we go there for my first meal of day , craving the great breakfast buffet, but is was no longer being serve, but they have in their lunch menu omelets, egg sandwiches and even Belgian waffles. I was so happy, nothing cures my hangover better than a hearty breakfast. loved it, loved it, loved it. Great food, great prices, wide variety of dishes and the service was outstanding."

Since we were already at the Venetian.. we decided WHY NOT! We were seated at their \"patio\" area that's basically on the casino floor (too smokey for our kids)  You can be asked to be seated inside the GIANT dinning room. The menu is very similar to the cheese cake factory (TCF) BECAUSE it is OWNED by them too! The complimentary bread was a crusty wheat different from TCF's two loaves. We ordered the caramel chicken, taste exactly the same as TCF. Kid's menu is exactly the same as well.  \n\nEnding to this story- if you want TCF on the strip come here! same portions, similar menu, it's a little less glamorous than the plethora of famous chef establishments but it's a sure thing for a modest price."

It's not outrageously expensive; it's just definitely priced according to where it is and the property it is part of.\n\nA GREAT tip: This location is by far, the least busy of the two. When there are huge lines at the Venetian location, this one is almost always a walk-in. \n\nThe portions here are beyond generous; I've had burgers here as well as salads - everything is very tasty and absolutely satisfying.\n\nThe last time we were here, service started great and then our waitress simply disappeared; to the point of being frustrating.

Didn't feel like sitting inside and wanted to just kick it in our suite with the grub... so I opted for take out. Since we stayed in the Palazzo... I went to the Grand Lux Cafe downstairs.Kinda like a Cheesecake Factory. The menu had the same sort of feel. I wonder if they're sister restaurants??\n\n I ordered take out from the bakery around the corner... ended up choosing a bacon cheeseburger with fries... no thousand island sauce and no onions with a side of ranch. The cute young cashier told me it'd be about 15 minutes. I went into the casino to gamble and pass time... and guess what?! I won $127 on the Wheel of Fortune $1 machine. AWESOME!!! Cashed out and went back to the bakery and the cashier told me it'd be a little wait longer... no problem! I called my Mom to tell her the good news and then called my boyfriend as well. We were on the phone for quite some time... and the employee started fixing the chairs and closing the door so I had to ask if the bakery was closed?! He said yes but that my take out order was coming. I hung up with my boyfriend... walked around the casino to eye out a machine... went back, and still no food! By then I was hungry and frustrated... looked at my phone and the ticket and realized it had been almost an hour! WTF?! Went in to the restaurant and spoke to the host and said I wanted a refund... even he was trippin that it had been almost an hour! I guess since I was gambling and on the phone the time just flew! As soon as the manager came out and I gave him my ticket the employee from the bakery brought my food out... almost at the exact same time! Once the manager looked at my ticket and realized it had been almost an hour he gave me the food and said \"keep it and follow me for a refund\". Score! \n\nGot my refund, got my burger and fries, and enjoyed it upstairs in my suite. JUICY burger! HUGE patty. I mean HUGE! I love me a good burger and lemme tell you... it was ALMOST worth the one hour wait LOL! I'll be back again, but no take out!"

I was told the other sandwich was good, however the fries for both were not only cold, but chewy and dry. Whether they typically don't take much consideration for take out orders, or because their organization in the kitchen needs work: I'm not certain because I've only eaten here this one time.

We had a deal where we were credited for two continental breakfasts with our reservation, so we didn't want to miss out on free food.\n\nThe first morning we just stuck to the free breakfasts, and threw in a side of bacon. The continental included 3 small pastries and fruit. The pastries were not something I would go back for...it was a mixed bag, some were tasty (mini chocolate croissant), some were not so hot (dry weird bran muffin). Also, the fruit was not really ripe -- especially the melon. Our waitress was super nice though and noticed we didn't eat the fruit so swapped out the unripe melon without us asking.\n\nThe next day we ventured away from the free continental breakfast since we figured we'd still get a partial credit on our bill. \n\nWe tried the beignets which were awesome and had four dipping sauces: a bourbon custard and raspberry were especially good. Also they give you a big baket!\n\nFor our actual meal my husband got corned beef hash and I got a breakfast sandwich. His was very good, especially the corned beef. Mine was okay...nothing exceptional. Both our hash browns were off...I asked for extra extra crispy and they came out barely cooked and pale...his we're very browned but oddly soggy.\n\nAlso, not sure what is with the coffee but I really didnt care for it. I love strong coffee, and this was strong, but it also tasted like Folgers..\n\nSo overall there are definitely some tasty items but also some misses.

This place has mediocre food at outrageous prices.\n\nWe arrived @ 5 pm and was quickly seated. The place is pretty large, and the 20 or so groups in the restaurant only occupied perhaps 20% of the tables. At first, I thought our waiter was very attentive. However, as the evening wore on, he became more of a pest... This place has a large menu. My wife is recently from Japan and does not read English that fast, and are unfamiliar with many of the dishes, so I have to explain many of them to her. Despite the fact that I told our waiter I will need about 10 minutes before we're ready to order, he kept coming back every minute or two to ask if I was ready to order... what's his hurry?\n\nWe ordered alcoholic drinks. Funny, prices for alcoholic drinks are not on the menu... this should have given me a clue, but.... My wife and I both ordered Mohitos. They were $11 a pop.... this is nightclub bar prices... outrageous.\n\nThen we shared chicken lettuce wraps $10, and a short rib sandwich w/fries $13\n\nThe lettuce wrap had good flavor but too much.  The taste was too thick, and after 2 bites, it quickly became too salty.\n\nThe short rib sandwich w/caramelized onion and melted cheese was very bland.\n\nI would not go back here again."

Located in the Palazzo and very close to LAVO, this is a good place for pre-clubbing large groups and those late night drinkers who desperately need to eat. \n\nEvery time I've come here the service has been hit or miss. This place tends to be busy no matter what time of day it is. It took our waiter about 45 minutes just to get us waters. It took just as long to get us extra silverware and napkins. Our waiters were switched out twice, which is something that somewhat bothers me when it comes to service because our last waiter had everyone's orders mixed up and even brought the wrong drinks at one point. \n\nThe food was decent, but nothing really to rave about. Neither were the drinks, although fancy sounding lowered my expectations. The portions were plentiful and matched their fair prices. Presentation was done well, but completely overshadowed by the service. \n\nHonestly, this place is never my first choice when it comes to restaurants in Vegas, but mostly a last resort. I've had better service at a Cheesecake Factory."

I was expecting it to be a lot busier.  We were a party of 6, 4 adults and 2 kids.  The bread basket was good, I think I prefer it to CF.  A rustic sourdough, although the butter wasn't softened.  They also carry coke products \n\nI don't eat beef and my most favorite turkey burger is the turkey burger from the Cheesecake Factory.  So, I ordered it here, and it didn't disappoint.  The bread they serve it on isn't really conducive to the burger( its long and rustic), so I just removed it and enjoyed the burger.  Very moist, tasty turkey burger.  Served with fries and not that many of them too. \n\nWe had lettuce wraps and ceviche as an appetizer.  I didn't taste the latter, but the lettuce wraps are similar to the wraps at PF Changs.  Not the same lettuce wraps as CF. \n\nMy friend had the kobe meatballs and she raved about it.  Her son had a filet mignon and not one morsel was left on the plate.  Another son had a kids cheese pizza.  Not much to say about that.  Friends husband had the caramel chicken and he seemed to enjoy it.  They liked their alcoholic drinks. \n\nService was pleasant and not too overbearing.  A good solid choice for a hotel, especially if you don't want to taxi it someplace else."

Very large portions with a very big menu with just about everything. Restaurant is owned my the same company who owns The Cheesecake Factory so it has a very similar feel and atmosphere. We had the chicken and waffles for breakfast, the Deluxe sandwhich, crab and asparagus omelette and beignets for breakfast across the two times we visited. For dinner, we started with the small portion of the calamari. It was good but nothing different than your standard fried calamari. For our entree, we shared the Cobb salad and the bbq chicken pizza. Thank goodness we shared as the portions are huge and we couldn't even finish what we ordered. All the food was very good and service was also good. Only reason for four stars was due to the wait time for the food. Each time we waited for our food it seemed much longer than expected. Would still highly recommend."

There are 2 Grand Lux cafe's at the Palazzo so make sure to come to this because the other one does not have beignets.\n\n_Strawberry Belgian Waffles, were amazing and great in size. Surprisingly it's hard to find a good Belgian waffle. Either its too dense, flaky, mushy, whatever it may be this place had it down! perfect amount of crisp and nice and soft inside. The strawberries were fresh as well.\n_Lox and Cream cheese, I was surprised at how fresh the smoked salmon were. The bagel and cream cheese topped with salmon, red onions and cucumber was just the perfect bite. MMMMM sounds good right now!\n_Fresh Garden Omelette. Was big in portion and just what I had in mind. I asked for egg whites instead. Comes with toast and hash browns. All the vegetables were cooked well and a good ratio as well.\n_Beignets..... H.E.A.V.E.N! everything I thought it would be and more. Comes in 8 which is more than enough. Good size and so warm. You must eat it right when it comes out. It tastes best warm, as soon as it gets cooler it does not taste the same. Still great but not as good as the beginning. My first bite was orgasmic! comes with 4 sides, syrup, ground cinnamon, condensed milk, and strawberry jam I think. I just kept dipping and eating I did not realize I had eaten 6! had a bit of a stomach ache but it was damn worth it!! I like it dipped with the condensed milk, or the jam with cinnamon! the beignets itself was so moist, fluffy and light you don't even need the sauces. \n\nCarb and sugar overload but one of the best breakfasts I've had. Their coffee was actually quite good as well."

Don't feel like you have to dress up and get all schmoozy for every meal while you're in vegas.  This is a good \"normal people\" place.  While it's pricier than, say, Chili's, it's good for the portions you get.  Which leads me to....\n7. Big portions\n\nI'm not joking. Everything really is good here.  Let's talk about the Asian Nachos first.  Big, round wontons with melted cheese, chicken, green onions, PEANUT SAUCE, WASABI CREAM SAUCE, and banging rice.  I dont know wtf they put in it but it's so freaking good.  I dream about Asian Nachos and crave them constantly.  I've forced all of my friends to try them and now they're all just as addicted.\n\nFor the reset of the food:  All of their soups are delicious, even if they sound boring, each one packs a punch of flavor.  I like ordering a lot of little things off the tapas menu.  Buffalo chicken bites? Hell yes.  Pastas are delicious, my boyfriend loves their pepperoni pizza- they give you tiny, perfectly crispy pepperonis.  Burgers are great.... literally everything is good.

It's a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for.  \n\n-Regular Burger with 3 toppings ($14) - they cooked it medium rare just the way I had asked, and the burger was insanely big.  It came with fries and everyhing which made it hard to even finish such a giant burger.  I had asked for cheese, avocado, and mushroom...now how can that not be an amazing burger just already.\n\n-Short Rib Sandwich ($16?) - There's a reason why there were two of us ordered the same exact thing.  It looked damn good on the menu and we didn't want to share.  And just as suspected, it was great.  Greasy, yes, but the toasty bread sandwiching short rib meat was phenomenal.  \n\n-Knowing this type of food exists around the strip, I'm glad to say I'll be looking forward to staying somewhere nearby next time I'm in vegas too.  btw, NO TO Imperial Palace"

Rich was warm and accommodating but most of all reassuring as he has clearly dealt with nervous wedding couples before.\n\nFor the price, there really is no comparison. They are one of the most reasonably priced restaurants for large groups on the strip. But that doesn't mean their food isn't good. On the contrary, it satisfied our notoriously hard to please Korean and Chinese families. It truly was delicious food that wasn't overseasoned or too heavy or portioned too large (or too small).\n\nThe fudge cake dessert was the real topper and people couldn't get enough of it.\n\nThe staff that night was incredible. Extremely helpful while staying completely out of the way of all the action.\n\nIf you are looking a place to have your wedding reception dinner, I'd definitely check out the Grand Lux Palazzo. We are over the moon satisfied with our experience on all fronts."

            "review": "During my two recent family stay cations on the Las Vegas Strip, there was a dining experience in the Grand Lux Cafe. They were grand luxury dining experiences that were reasonably priced. \n\n   Before reporting on my two recent dining experiences in The Grand Lux Cafe back in late March and May, I will bring up a few facts about the glorified cafe of the Palazzo Resort. First, the menu is large covering a selection of food ranging from baguettes to salmon and from $6.95 to $33.95. Second, the Cheesecake Factory is the parent company. That is not surprising considering how large the menu is. Third, Grand Lux Cafe features a bar plus an in-house bakery. And fourth, Grand Lux Cafe rocks. I will elucidate why on the preceding paragraphs. \n\n   The two times that my family and I dined in the Grand Lux Cafe were before a show. The funny thing is that in its own way, Grand Lux Cafe is similar to a show. The stage is an elegant restaurant and the delicious menu items are the stars. The Grand Lux Cafe dining environment compliments the elegance and luxury of the Palazzo. The marble floors, textures, fabrics, silverware, handkerchief napkins, and interior create a sense of dining in an elegant restaurant. In reality this is an upscale Cheesecake Factory. The first time we dined here we sat deep inside the restaurant with a view overlooking the bar. On the follow-up visit, we sat in the indoor patio overlooking the Palazzo casino. \n\n   On the first visit, I enjoyed the lunch special salmon piccata with a creamy lemon sauce with capers, artichokes, and mushrooms over a steamed rice. The entry for this meal was around $15. I ordered a Coke that added to the price. This meal left me satisfied. \n\n  On the second visit, I ordered the chicken parmesan. The guarguantium portion of chicken breast covered with parmesan bread crumbs, melted hot Mozzarella cheese, and tomato sauce over pasta put me on cloud 9. The amount of quality food that they served me was really a two-parter. If I wasn't on a stay cation, half of it would of gone to my refrigerator and warmed up the next day. The entry to this dining experience was around $20. Like last time I ordered a Coke that added to the price. This meal left me very satisfied. \n\n  Proceeding both meals that I had in this Grand Lux Cafe was a basket of complimentary warm house bread. Also on both visits, we had a friendly and attentive server. \n\n   When I review restaurants on the touristy Las Vegas Strip, the question is, \"would I patronize the place if it was off the Strip?\"  This leads into the question, \"If Grand Lux Cafe was off the Strip would I patronize it?\" Absolutely! The food and the amount they give you at a reasonable price inside a restaurant environment that blends the grandeur of European cafes with the American restaurant makes it competitive to many of the local restaurants in Las Vegas. Until and if they build an off-Strip Grand Lux Cafe, I anticipate patronizing this or its sister location at the Venetian in the future."

I've had the crispy flautas, chicken pasta w/ sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms, pasta carbonara, pasta molino, and others and loved them all. The portions are HUGE too--perfect to split with your friend or to have leftovers for more munchies when you're drunk again 4 hrs later. And if you go during lunch, they have lunch-sized portions (which are still big) of the pastas for a few bucks cheaper. \n\nMy only complaint is the service. Just as I've never been disappointed by the food, I've never been happy with the service. The bread often comes out after the food and a few pointed requests for it, the food always takes forever to be served, and the waitresses rarely come by to check on our table to refill our drinks or see how we're doing. I understand their desire to give us a wide berth when our party is a group of 12 drunkasses, but it's been like that even when I've gone with 2 other girls completely sober and composed in the middle of the afternoon."

This place is related/linked to the Cheesecake factory, so if you've been there, you'll find the Grand Lux menu and pricing familiar. \n\nWhen on my home turf, I wouldn't consider the Cheesecake Factory an expensive eat, but I wouldn't call it a cheap eat either. However, by Vegas standards, the Grand Lux, for the quality of the food served, is quite moderately priced. And I love that it's always open. In Vegas, when you're out late and hungry at 2am or later, that's awesome.\n\nI've tried a few things here and everything has been good, but most memorable was a grilled cheese/short rib sandwich I had for lunch one time.

We were greeted by a very upbeat waiter, which was very pleasing. There was a 6 minute wait for our drinks, and a 15 minute wait for our food. I ordered the Chicken Angeli (in which the waiter said that it was his favorite), and my friend ordered the pierogies. It was really worth the wait since the food was flawless, and the prices were reasonable.  \n\nWe didn't order any dessert since we went to ILLY (also in Palazzo) for some affogatos. As for our drinks, we ordered the Berry Fizz, which is 3 types of berries blended with Sprite. It looked good, and it was very tasty. Even two other women sitting at a table next to us saw our drinks and asked us what they were. \n\nYou'll have to walk through some gambling areas to get to this place, as it is not in the \"shopping mall\" area. If you want to go to a nice restaurant without spending a fortune, then I highly recommend coming here. Oh, and this restaurant is owned by The Cheesecake Factory.\n\nEnjoy!"

I don't know how one person can finish it all.  Since you're at Vegas and you're most likely a tourist and don't have a microwave for the leftovers, so it's better to share one dish.  They give a lot for a good price.  The bread that they give you is warm and soft from the moment you get it from the basket.  it's not the typical french bread.  It's like a wheat bread with a sweet taste.  I constantly would ask them, \"more bread, please.\"  Definitely need to try the New Orleans beignet, the sweet and puffy pastry with some powdered sugar.  Along with it, they give you three sauces to dip: chocolate, raspberry, and jack daniel sauce.  The service and atmosphere is very nice.  Our waitress was attentive.  There are two Grand Lux Cafe, one in Venetian and one in Palazzo.  Only the one in Palazzo has the New Orleans beignet."

Wifey went with the Shortrib Grilled Cheese, and I got the Korean Sriracha Burger-Bulgogi piled high with onions and mushrooms on a beef patty(perfect medium rare like I requested) and sriracha mayo on a brioche bun. Both of these were winners!\n\nAnother suggestion by our waiter was their  made to order Beignets, and people have raved on their reviews about  this dessert, so we decided to give it a shot, planned ahead and boxed up half of our entrees to save room. The Beignets came with 8 pieces and three sauces-chocolate, raspberry, and vanilla anglaise. So wishing it was love at first bite, we couldn't get past that fryer grease aftertaste even with the sugar on top or the three sauces. Barely three pieces were eaten, and I kinda regretted not going with something else..\n\nWill definitely be back for their savory stuff and be more careful if and when ordering a dessert.

They were really flavorful and the blue cheese sauce was nearly angelic and that's coming from a guy who doesn't particularly like blue cheese. The pot roast fries were equally good and we were happy to see that the restaurant was generous with the pot roast, which was quite tender. \n\nI was disappointed with my first order of shrimp scampi, as quite a bit of the noodles were hard and stuck together. The waiter changed it with no problem. While I did get another fresh plate, it wasn't bursting with flavor like the shrimp scampi I had at their sister restaurant the Cheesecake Factory. The noodles and cream sauce was good, but the shrimp was a bit of a let down. They just seemed really bland. In my experience shrimp scampi can be pretty hit or miss. I'm guessing the seasoning of the shrimp lacked enough salt. \n\nMy wife really enjoyed the crab cakes and I love that we like to share, because I did as well. The outside was really crisp, but the filling was really cakey and you could taste the crab meat. \n\nService wasn't stellar, as there were a couple of hiccups with our drink order and silverware wasn't on the table to start, but that was quickly alleviated. What we did learn was that a lot of waiters here in Vegas don't hear the word \"seltzer\" when it asked for that type of water. When I said \"soda\" water, they knew what I meant. So I give my waiter a pass on that.\n\nAll in all, it was a good experience and the food was great with the exception of the shrimp scampi."

You gotta go there and order some to understand why I'm calling fried potatoes \"cute.\" I'm not sure if it was because it was the \"morning after\" breakfast or not, but this was one of the yummiest! \n\nWe also ordered the Red Velvet cake in celebration of my friend's birthday. Red Velvet. Enough said. It was to die for. Mentioned to the waitress that it was indeed for a birthday and asked if she could put on a candle.

I presume that they must have gone to a berry patch in North Arizona to pick the berries fresh because a pancake takes what, 10 minutes if you mix the batter from scratch?  Mine took over 30 minutes.  So this next part might sound nit-picky, but here goes... cold syrup for the pancakes and they didn't even bother to bring out butter.  Am I the only person who butters their pancakes?  No, because my mom showed me how to do that when I was a tyke.  So after another 10 minutes the butter appears.  It's ice cold.  You almost needed a steak knife to cut this butter.  So it's not going to spread, it's not going to melt down in the cold syrup and the temperature of the pancake is going fast.  I can either send this back or power through.  I choose to power through and just get out of there.  The pancake itself was tasty.  I think the berries really were fresh.

So we decided on just a couple of appetizers. Our server was extremely patient with us as we just could not make a more spontaneous decision.\n\nHere's what we did decide on:\n\nAsian Short Rib Tacos:  Three mini corn tortillas  filled with grilled marinated kogi-style short rib, housemate korean kimchi and spicy chili aioli... spicy it was and the best appetizer of the two chosen.\n\nBBQ Pork Sliders: Three topped with cole slaw and spicy bbq sauce on toasted mini buns... Bit too stringy and dry.  Bland after tasting the other appetizer.\n\nI cannot reinterate enough about how wonderful our table service with Cathleen P was. Plenty of time had since elapsed. As we went back down to the garage it had since emptied out and we easily 4exited with our now happy tummies!"

            "review": "Have any of you ever had the feeling where you just can't stand another buffet in Vegas?  Or just simply sick and tired of looking at all the food stations with endless possibilities for a potential food coma? (Well I never had that problem but people in my party certainly had that predicament)  So I guess I will just have to follow suit and take in a regular dining facility instead of the glamorous world of buffet heaven.\n\nI've been to a Grand Lux before so it wasn't anything new to me.   It is the sister restaurant of Cheesecake Factory's therefore I have no complaints here at all.  Just like any Cheesecake's you've been to it's got lavish decor, dim lighting, and of course, endless options on their menu.\n\nIt's a typical California (cheesecake factory) fare where you can pretty much get anything and everything.. so here are the dishes that our party have ordered!\n\nPolynesian Salad!  Citrusy flavored dressing with a hint of sweetness all rolled into one drizzled upon a pyramid like salad concoction.  The veggie temple was build with a foundation of mixed greens and tiered off by giant wonton crisps!  It's pretty much the sister version of the Luau Salad at the Cheesecake factory... one of the most delicious salads for a nice sit down restaurant!\n\nGrand Cobb Salad:  It's grand but actually not as large portioned as the Polynesian salad.  It's got all your typical culprits in a cobb (avocado, bacon, turkey, egg whites, etc..) All dressed in bleu cheese!  (I thought it was ranch..  Yuck!  I hate Blue Cheese!!!  However, when I actually gave it a try, the dressing as actually tasty and bearable!  (I simply cannot handle bleu cheese) So that's actually tasty as well!\n\nMadeira Chicken:  Didn't get to try this out but according to our friends, it was tasty!  (I'm not a big chicken breast dish kind of guy so I never order these things)  I'll just take their word for it!\n\nSpicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich:  Same as above as I didn't get to try the sammy, but it was gone from my buddy's plate so that's a good sign!  Gotta try that next time!\n\nSlow Roasted Short Ribs of Beef:  Great BBQ flavor!  It's your typical BBQ flavor dish but definitely tasty!  (With BBQ you really cannot go wrong unless you overcook it which will make it super dry and gross)  But it was nicely flavored, juicy, and delicious overall!  (huge portion too! as it was served with veggies and mash Potato!)\n\nFried Calamari:  Highlight alert!  This is one of the best Calamari that I've ever had in many different places!  They fried their calamari along with veggies and rock shrimp to create the most heavenly dish (one of my all time favorites!) served with ranch and spicy aioli dressing!  I'm telling you, if you were to pick one dish to get at Grand Lux, this one is highly highly recommended!  Oh... did I mention the portion for this is huge?  Well you bet it is!  Totally worth every penny!\n\nLastly, service was awesome as it comes to expected being affiliated with cheesecake Factory.  They brought out wrong salad dressing for me and when I asked for it, 2 different wait staff came out with the dressing!  (Now I got 3!)  Great attention to customer's needs is definitely a plus!\n\nSo there you have it, Grand Lux Cafe, opens 24 hrs, in Venetian or Palazzo, and will serve your morning, noon, dinner, or late night dining needs in case you are totally turned off by the buffets of  Vegas!  A terrific alternative yet decently priced!"

I did come here two times while being in Vegas. Both time different because the first was during a late lunch and I chose to get a chicken sandwhich which had mushroom and avocado. The sandwhich was nice. The price wasn't too bad considering it was vegas. I spend about $25 with my raspberry lemonade. The lemonade was kinda sweet for me though but good nonetheless. \n\nThe second time we came in for a brunch/latedinner thing. It was like 1130. That time it was a great deal for 15.95. They offered eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, orange juice, omelets, waffles, danish, yogurt, cereal and many more. It was enough to get me full for a great price."

I dunno why, but I really liked the Grand Lux Cafe.\n\nI was expecting nothing special after seeing that it was essentially just a fancy version of a Cheesecake Factory. And our waitress seemed a little odd at first... well, she was a little odd, but maybe that was just cause she was psychic. She was really on the ball and knew what we needed before we did.\n\nThe bread they bring you at the beginning was REALLY crusty. Which I am all over, but if you are not a fan of crunchy things, you may want to just go for the moist center and leave the crust.\n\nThe food was excellent. I had the Pizza Margherita and Salad lunch special, and my wife had the Pasta Telephono and salad lunch special. The bleu cheese and vinaigrette dressings were fabulous. Good bleu cheese is hard to come by, but this place nailed it.\n\nThe pasta was cheesy and delicious. Came in a pink sauce (tomato + cream). If you are a fan of mac and cheese, you will probably like the pasta telephono.\n\nThe pizza Margherita was really fantastic. I'm the kind of person to be disappointed by pizza since we make it at home from scratch, but this pizza lived up to my standards.\n\nAnd, did I mention the entire meal was vegetarian? We didn't even notice until afterward. I love that! Vegetarian without being in your face about it.\n\nAnd, did I mentions the portions are generous? More than enough food!\n\nSo color me a fan. I really didn't expect it to be that good. I'm tempted to go again, so maybe I should try the Venetian location next time."

I was in for a terrible surprise. For the epic of all epic birthdays, I had planned a weekend in Vegas and invited 25 of my closest friends (for my 25th birthday). 2 weeks before my birthday, I called the Grand Lux and made reservations for the 25 of us knowing they'd need an early heads up. They were ok with it. 2 days before my arrival, I called to confirm my reservation with the restaurant. \n\nThen comes the night of. I rally my 25 friends, we head to Palazzo and walk in. I go to check in and give the server my name & party size. \n\"Um, we only have you down for 15\" \nthen they ask me my name\n\"Um, actually we don't have you on our reservations list at all\"\n(so I go from 25 to 15 to nothing!?)\nI then check to see if I had made the reservations at the Venetian instead. Nope. \nThen I ask them to check their call logs and voila, 2 days ago they had a call w/ me and confirmed my 25 person party. In a panic, they throw together tables and split my group in 2. \nNo one likes splitting their group across tables on their birthday dinner. That's LAME. \nThe manager assures me they'll 'make it a special night for me' as it was my birthday and they had already messed up my reservation. \n\nSo, how did they make it special? \n1. they neglected to bring me the BBQ sauce I asked for.\n2. he then brought me 6 passes to Tao (to use with my 25 person party!?!? what!?) and he also knew we already had plans to go to Tryst and had a car arriving at 10:30 so we had requested to get our orders in as fast as possible (we had to run out the door when the car arrived). \n3. my friends had requested a birthday cake for me. they brought a plate out with 2 squirts of whipped cream and a cracker that said 'have a grand day' - WHAT!?!? is this really supposed to be a dessert? (I will attach a photo when I get home) That's just insult to injury at this point - might as well not bring a dessert at all. \n\nTo say the least, this was a terrible experience for a night that had been planned 2 weeks in advance.

I highly recommend this sandwich, its only $11. \n\nThe second time here was on Sunday like around 5am. After a long night of club hopping and partying we had to make a stop here. My friends and I were all starving and some of us were even drunk. This time I ordered the DeLux Drive-In Burger, it came with an order of fries. The burger was tasty and the fries were good. The place was full around this time, I guess its a popular place after being up all night in Vegas. We even started talking to some girls that were sitting next to us... haha! \n\nI highly recommend this place for either breakfast or lunch. It is very affordable and you feel like you're dining at a super expensive restaurant. I still need to go back to try their dinner plates. I will be back!!"

My parents don't eat beef or pork, so it was kind of difficult to find restaurants on the Strip that had more than one or two good non-beef-or-pork options. Luckily, the Grand Lux Cafe has a plethora of dishes of all sorts. The menu here has to be the longest I've ever seen. As someone who is not a picky eater, I normally hate long menus, but I was grateful for it in this case, because my parents could finally choose a dish they really wanted. If you have a large party of people with different dietary requirements or cuisine  preferences, I would highly recommend this place.\n\nOur server was great. My mom ordered the jambalaya, and the server made sure that the chefs made it without the ham. She was also attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nThe food was quite good. I had the crispy caramel chicken. The caramel sauce was a good balance of sweetness and spiciness, and all of the vegetables were fresh and cooked well. The portions are gigantic though! I have a healthy appetite, yet I was only able to eat about 3/5 of my meal. Unless you are really hungry, I would recommend sharing an entree with someone.\n\nWhile looking at the menu, we saw that Grand Lux Cafe offers made-to-order desserts (which you order at the same time of your main dishes), so we decided to try the peach cobbler. While the cobbler was really good (not too sweet, lots of peach), it wasn't quite as spectacular as I thought it would be. However, I'm from Texas so I have pretty high standards for cobbler. \n\nOverall, we all enjoyed our food here. I think the value you get is good compared to most of the other restaurants on the Strip too."

It feels like you're walking into a very modern, well designed restaurant with bar. The finishes are great and I expected it to be dressy, but it was casual. Whew, not having a suit didn't ruin me this trip.\n\nOur wait staff was all amazing, which really helps. Since I ate here quite a bit, I'm going to review each dish.\n\nSmoked Salmon Platter with Tomato ($13.95) Onion, Cream Cheese and a Toasted Bagel. Very tasty. We didn't feel like a huge breakfast, so it was a good size. Maybe not the best value on the menu, but the quality was quite good.\n\nDuck Triangles ($4.95) Crispy Wrappers Filled with Minced Duck, Onions, Garlic, Ginger, Soy and Sesame. Amazing. This was wonderful. The duck was perfect as there was enough to get the taste and it melded quite well with the dipping sauce. Must try in my humble opinion. \n\nMini Pizza's ($5.95)\nTomato and Fresh Mozzarella: Cherry Tomatoes, Garlic, Mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan Cheese. A great little pizza. So nice to share with another appetizer or if you're not super hungry, just the right size. Thin crust style that was very tasty and not greasy or oily. \n\nRoasted Chicken and Potato:Roasted Garlic, Fresh Rosemary, Mozzarella and Parmesan Cheese. One of my favorite type of pizzas. I don't miss the tomato sauce at all and wow the flavors really pop on this one. \n\n\nBlue Cheese Salad $(9.95) Organic Greens Tossed with Blue Cheese Dressing and Topped with Bacon, Tomato, Croutons and Maytag Blue Cheese Crumbles. Good salad. I liked it but I wanted to try something else. It went really well with the mini pizza though.\n\nChili-Lime Chicken and Mango Salad ($10.95) Grilled Chicken, Sweet Mango, Avocado, Jicama, Sweet Corn, Onions, Cilantro and Romaine, Tossed with Chili-Lime Vinaigrette and Crispy Tortillas.I ended up ordering this salad twice because it was so tasty. It was fresh, the mango added a little citrus, the avocado was creamy, the corn was awesome for adding texture with flavor, and there was a wonderful crunch from the tortillas. \n\nPotato Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce ($13.95) Delicious Housemade Gnocchi Tossed in Creamy Vodka Sauce and Fresh Basil. Wow. Wow. It may have been the best Gnocchi I've had. Ever. Amazing texture and consistency that is lacking at most places. The vodka sauce was perfect for this. Paired really well with the previous salad I reviewed.\n\nIf you want a great place to eat with darn good prices, this is definitely the place."

They stated that Grand Lux is owned by the same company as The Cheesecake Factory, so it's essentially the same. \n\nMy friends and I ordered takeout on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend. They have a separate little space for takeout orders and pickups. I ordered the chicken pot pie for dinner. Our group order took about half an hour, which wasn't too bad considering we had six or seven orders. Since my chicken pot pie was a to go order, it was essentially deconstructed, with the contents of the pie, the crust, and the bread separate. The portions are huge and way more than what one person can consume in one seating. The taste of the pot pie content was very distinct, almost like how cream of mushroom or Alfredo tastes from the jar. It was decent to me because I was hungry, but embarrassing to say I still prefer Marie Callender's chicken pot pie over Grand Lux Caf\u00e9. My friends ordered a variety of items and my one friend who ordered the kale avocado salad liked the portion as well as the taste. \n\nOverall, it seemed like Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 was just OK. If it is the only option, I wouldn't dread having it again. However, I probably wouldn't seek it out."

The last two trips home I've really enjoyed this particular location. \n\nWHY? ....drumroll....\n\nBecause they have BEIGNETS! It is the ONLY Grand Lux in Vegas to have Beignets. My bff Ame and I absolutely love them here. \n\nIt's a generous serving with about 8-9 beignets and three sauces: Raspberry, chocolate, and creme fraiche. \n\nAme and I always end up mixing the raspberry with the creme fraiche each time. I recommend you do the same. It will change your life. \n\nAs for their regular food, everything here is average to delicious, so you really can't go wrong. \n\nTheir salads are divine, as these are SERIOUS salads with great combos of ingredients. I particularly recommend the Asian Chicken Salad and Polynesian salad (the jicama and macadamia nuts with mango..yum). \n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps are yummy as well, and their volcano shrimp is delicious. \n\nOver the years it seems like they've changed the coating to their Grand Fried Calamari.. it used to be rock shrimp, zuccini, and onions fried in a thin coating of batter, but now the coating is a lot thicker and more tempuralike. Ame and I are not fans of the new formulation. Still tasty, but not the same. \n\nLove the place for a quick bite. Service is always fantastic 100% of the time. Ame and I typically come here to catch up on girl time, and the servers are always gracious to keep pouring us water and refilling my tea/coffee when they don't have to (we always take care of them, of course for their kindness :). Seriously - they're always the nicest servers I've seen in town. \n\nPrices may seem a dollar or two higher than your average diner, but this isn't your average diner, and plus it's at the Palazzo. Duh. \n\nCome. Get the Beignets. Be happy. And mix the creme fraiche and raspberry sauces."

About 25 minutes in, the manager came over to retake our order. Not much of an apology was given, offered to comp one of the dishes after we inquired. The server was awful. In the 45 minutes we were there, she stopped by twice to check in, only after another server overheard us complaining about the service. \n\nSo much for having a hearty meal before an evening of boozing. We ordered pizza instead from another place. \n\nThe manager couldn't give us an ETA on our food so after 45 minutes, we left.\n\nGood bread, horrible service."

A perfect light appetizer to start your meal. \n\n2. Shrimp Scampi with linguini served in a white wine sauce. \n-  This dish was really delicious, albeit a bit on the heavy side b/c of the white wine cream sauce. The shrimp were huge and flavorful, and the white wine sauce had a very tasty citrius flavor to it. \n\n3. Pinapple Mojito\n- pinapple was not overly sweet, or tart. However, they did not muddle th mint leaves enough to bring out the flavors commonly found in a mojito. After a few minutes of mashing up the decorative mint in the glass the mojito tasted a LOT better. \n\n\nOn a side note the sourdough bread served prior to ordering is quite tasty. I love how crusty it is and it serves as a great tool to sop up the delicious white wine sauce for our scampi dish. YUMMMY! I'd definitely eat here again. :D"

While dining in, the menu is huge, honestly there is so much to choose from, I kind of see that as a bad thing, makes people take a long ass time to order, but I ordered the Zen noodles which was like thai noodle soup, it was ok, soup was pretty decent, they don't pour all the soup in and leave it in a cup in case you want to poor the rest, it isn't huge, but I didn't expect that it would be."

If you don't feel like eating cheap fast food but want something good for an affordable price, Grand Luxe is the place to be! Large portions which lasted us until dinner for about an average of $10! I had a tequila drink, forgot the name, but it had patron in it and was very smooth and fruity. We ordered the fried calamari appetizer for the 2 of us and they gave us a lot! We ate so much we were almost full by the time we got our entrees. I ordered some lasagna dish, they make it differently than other lasagnas but i was too full to enjoy the fantastic flavors that i had to togo 2/3 of it! my bf had some sort of cobb salad and it looked so appealing a random came up to us and asked what he ordered.

We went twice on our most recent trip and both experiences were terrible. \n\nTheir breakfast buffet is a pretty good deal, $16 including juice and coffee. The food for the buffet was completely average. I ordered a hot chocolate in addition to my juice and while it looked absolutely amazing it had absolutely no flavor. The worst part of the experience was the incredibly slow service that we had to endure. \n\nOur second trip was a late night trip for something in our bellies to sop up everything we had been drinking that night. My eggs were predictable, but my husband's sandwich was so incredibly salty that he could not eat it. In addition, the saltiness combined with the copious amounts of alcohol did not make for a happy scenario the next morning. \n\nFor breakfast or brunch head to Morels. For late night eats go over to Noodles Asia in the Venetian or dare I say it...walk down the street to Denny's."

I also recently stopped here for drinks (their fancy drinks are pretty good) and a late dinner, and I was very pleased, too.  Dinner is tougher because they do have so many different options.  It was hard to decide but I was pleased to see a large selection of salads, sandwiches, appetizers and smaller entrees as well as larger specialty entrees and pastas.  We were a party of six and everyone's food looked great, and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  I had the chicken flatbread which was well-seasoned, tasty and HUGE.  It was way too much food for one person.  I was also thrilled that they substituted tasty mashed sweet potatoes for the fries that were supposed to come with my meal and there was no additional charge.\n\nThe service is very good here.  I think they are very well-trained and they execute well, and they're friendly.  The prices are pretty reasonable, especially for the amount of food you get.

The Palazzo location is rolling out some new menu items--test marketing if you will.  My friend and I ordered off that special menu.  I ordered a couple of tapas and she ordered the Bourbon chicken (I think that's what it was).  I should also mention that our server was lovely.  Very personable and courteous.  So, we ordered.  We waited about 20 minutes while chatting and out came the manager with my tapas and said to my friend, \"We're out of the chicken.  You'll have to order something else.\"  First of all, our server didn't even know that they were out of that dish.  Secondly, and this is a big second, almost everything on the menu is chicken with just a different sauce so I have trouble understanding that but maybe they ran out of sauce.  So, here's the problem:  I now have my food and my friend doesn't.  I offered to wait but then my food would get cold.  I offered to share with her but she's not an adventurous eater--no eggplant croquettes for her (but, boy howdy they were good).  So, she watched me eat and I watched her eat.  Our server came by and was shocked at what happened.  We didn't ask for any consideration but no service recovery was offered.  I just thought it was really bad form to bring my food out and then tell my friend she wasn't getting hers.  I am told that this little girl was just promoted to manager from a position as server.  I spoke to another restaurant manager during my stay in Las Vegas and I recounted this experience.  She responded that it was wrong on all levels.  Grand Lux, you may want to offer some training when you promote people.  I'll be back because I like the food but I'm sorely disappointed here."

The crust was very soft and crunchy and the soupy insides were delicious. I would come back just for the chicken pot pie.\n\nAnother saving point of this place is that it is open 24/7. My friend was able to get some pizza late at night to feed us cause of our drunchies."

It is equivalent to a Cheesecake Factory to me. \n\nI ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was good! Their batter was very crunchy and crispy. You can taste the shrimp and the dried squid rings.\n\nThe 3 way salmon I ordered came with mushrooms, mash potatoes, asparagus, and three different sauces-it was all delicious but the mash potatoes were okay.\n\nThe indo-China meal was my families favorite. It was brown rice and marinated chicken that had an Indonesian scent, pineapple and herby. It was comfort food."

I am not really a huge fan of this place, but it was the best option of the time since many places were closed already and we didnt really want to eat at the food court. I was excited to see my favorite on the menu-- chicken & waffles! drooool. It was definitely no roscoes, but it did its job. Breakfast is always a good option for any meal of the day. Overall the restaurant is pretty big and the menu is good for large groups with people with different tastes. It has something for everyone!"

I don't valet my \"whip.\" So to me, Venetian/Palazzo is a little too shi-shi for my tastes.\n\nHowever, when the BGB and I wanted to hit up some food after his shift at work, he recommended the Cheesecake Factory. \"It's open 24 hours,\" he said.\n\nWell, he really meant this place, which mildly worried me, since now I was inside the V/P at one of their restaurants, and my wallet was still on a Luxor budget. Fortunately, the food was really good. Turns out Grand Lux Cafe is managed (?) by the same people as Cheesecake Factory, which always puts out a good product. Bread is nice and tasty to start. We both had burgers (because you know I love burgers) and the meat was tender and flavorful. The atmosphere was nice -- you didn't feel like you were in what amounts to a casino cafe.\n\nMaybe one time when I have a little more money to spare I'll try a more signature dish, but for a first start it was rather good."

I usually sit at the bar and have always had great meals there.  \n\nIt's strange though, the Grand Lux at The Venetian, which is open 24 hours a day, isn't even close to as good.  I can't figure out why.  Maybe the 24 hour operation drains the spirit out of the workers.  Who knows.\n\nAt the Palazzo location, however, If you get the Linguine with Clams and pay an extra three bucks for the shrimp you have a $19.95 plate of pasta that is downright awesome.\n\nThe Corn Beef Hash and a Sam Adams is the time tested and purest way to kick any of the previous nights activities out of the loop and make you feel like sunshine.\n\nThey've got some version of the Molten Chocolate Cake that is grand.  It's take 20 minutes so be aware.\n\nOne word to the wise, their dishwasher leaves some kind of film that affects the taste of the draft beer.  The bartenders are aware of it and try to rinse the glasses before serving, but it slips their mind sometimes.\n\nOther than that, I have nothing but good things to say about this location of Grand Lux."

For Vegas, this restaurant was one of the lesser expensive options. For $13.95 ordered the Alfredo noodles - which were excellent. Simple, but the sauce was creamy and delicious as though they made it from scratch. Also got a Warm Goat Cheese Salad. The 'fried' goat cheese balls were delish but did not enjoy the dressing as much....it had apple chunks drizzled with honey which made the salad just a but too sweet. Not bad though. \n\n\nEveryone else at my table received their meals - all looked great and large portions. I would definitely come back!"

You can tell by its decor as well as the menu (there were a lot of dishes that were the same from Cheesecake Factory). \n\nService: Once I walked in, there was a nice ambiance around me, and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was very helpful and made sure we were comfortable with our food and kept checking up on us every so often.\n\nFood: For appetizers, I ordered the spinach dip -- pretty good. I ordered the pasta with chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and mushrooms, hoping that since this restaurant is from Cheesecake Factory, it would taste the same as the dish I usually order at CF. I was somewhat wrong. The cream sauce Grand Lux uses for that dish has a rather distinct/weird taste, and I didn't like it enough to finish the plate.\n\nI definitely would come here again to try the other dishes. The pricing is pretty decent too. Also, I hear it's open late (although the Grand Lux at The Venetian opens 24 hrs), so that's definitely a plus for people who are dancing the night away and get a little rumble in their stomach. (="

It's commercial and not great and the menu is full of too many options that are usually just ok, as it often is when you generalize instead of specialize. \nThat being said, we needed food and we needed it ASAP. We ordered the steak and eggs breakfast with wheat toast and crispy hash browns, the avocado chipotle burger, a side of fruit, 2 coffees, and 2 spicy bloody Mary's. Turned out that our order was a serious case of the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nThe good: the steak was decent, not too much fat, and decently medium rare. The bloody Mary's are delicious- the pickled asparagus was a great surprise for flavor. French fries were decent. Eggs were perfectly scrambled.\n\nThe bad: we ordered our burger medium well. It came medium rare. I don't mind, but my boyfriend hates how it makes the bun soggy. \n\nThe ugly: it took an insane amount of time to get our food and our drinks. The hash browns had to be sent back because they were soggy. The most amazing was how hard it was to get wheat toast. We had to send our toast back THREE times, no joke. We got sourdough twice and then white. What the hell?\n\nFor the price, this was a massive pain in the ass. Never again.\n\n\n**update: both boyfriend and I got sick three hours later. Definitely from the food. Never going back, for sure."

One of my friends ordered the steak with fried brussel sprouts and let me tell you, THIS STOLE THE NIGHT! OMG this hits my top 5 in fried foods.

My other friend ordered the dish with gnocchi and loved it as well. \n\nOur server was an older lady and was so nice! She was like a mom to us when she came over and was worried as to why we didn't finish our meals (but it was because we were stuffed, not that we didn't like the food!)\n\nDrinks: I ordered the pineapple cocktail recommended by our waitress and it was sooo delicious!

This particular location is a bit smaller than the location at The Venetian, but they share the same exact menu.\n\nGrand Luxe Cafe at The Palazzo is about 50 steps from the guest elevators...so phone in an order from the room, take the elevators down to the casino level, walk for a minute and BAM your food is handed over to you right off the bat.\n\nGiven that the pricing was great for such huge portions of food and the convenience of its location, I ate exclusively here during my last Vegas hop. It doesn't hurt that I tried something different at every meal session (Breakfast, lunch, dinner) and everything tasted GREAT. The blood orange mimosas here are pricey ($9-$11 for a champagne flute sized glass), but the PERFECT way to start off a lazy hung-over morning.\n\nHighly recommended items on the menu: duck pot-stickers, pasta carbonara, calamari appetizer, and four-cheese pizza. Hell, I'm going to assume ANYTHING on the menu is worth a shot and won't disappoint.\n\nIt's too bad this location closes at midnight as opposed to the 24/7 location next door at The Venetian."

GRAND LUX IS MY SPOT!!!\n\nThere are two locations, one in the Venetian and the other in the Palazzo. Now before you Vegas \"know-it-alls\" get all CRAZY on me, I realize the two hotels are located right next to each other. The reason why there are two of them is because one is ALWAYS open 24 hours, but they switch it every now and then. And since I'm a frequent guest of either hotel, this place is a GODSEND when you finally stroll into your hotel at dawn!!\n\nYes...it is owned by the same company as Cheesecake Factory, but I find it far superior in service, quality, selection and overall satisfaction. The food is awesome and not overpriced like everything else in Vegas. I almost never get the same thing, but I do enjoy the burgers and pastas. \n\nTo be honest, we usually only go here to get the FRESHLY BAKED COOKIES!!! OMG...THEY ARE YUMMMMMMMMO!! They really do make them to order, so if you're planning on having them for desert, make sure you let your waiter know when they bring your food because they take about 25-30 minutes. Or...you can get them to go and they are perfect DRUNK FOOD!!\n\nAll in all...definitely my \"go to\" restaurant in Vegas!!"

I don't think too many people have realized them or how awesome they are, based on the small crowd that was there while we were there.\n\nFirst of all, it's a nice little place. It is a classy looking joint (although they definitely feature a large TV for sports). I found this place on the internet before embarking on our Vegas vacation and knew I wanted to eat there. We enjoyed it so much the first time, we went back for more! It is a best kept secret...\n\nThey have the most amazing Happy Hour I have ever seen. They have a ton of $5-$7 appetizers and drinks. The first time we purchased a total of 5 appetizers & 4 high end drinks for about $50.\n\nMy husband loved their fried buffalo things (I guess I should look up the actual name). He ordered them more than once. We ordered their macaroni skillet twice. We tried several different things and all were delicious. I definitely recommend only ordering the spinach dip if more than one person wants it! I was the only who wanted it and it was far too much for one but delicious. As far as drinks go, I am a super fan of their raspberry cosmopolitan. I often check menus for those now based on this experience. \n\nTheir staff is also beyond polite. Super nice guys & very accommodating! I will return to this place during every stay I have in Vegas."

I said ALMOST.... ::hangs head in shame::\nAte there twice this past visit and both times, service was pretty stellar. Both times, the waitress was attentive and quick to bring us what we needed. My girls and I shared orders from the \"Small Bites\" section during our first visit, which were exactly what we needed to fuel our subsequent visit to Azure afterward (because who really wants to see my extended post-nosh belly? Not me!). We ordered a couple plates of the mini-tacos (both pork and fish), the mac and cheese and the ahi ceviche. For having such an extensive menu, all items were tasty and left very good impressions with all of us. Between three rather ravenous girls, we were satiated without being uncomfortably full. \nThe second visit was a post-drinking munchy-fix, so burgers were on our mind. I originally ordered the veggie burger and the waitress was quick to check to see if I had ordered it before, as she did NOT recommend it (love honesty from waitstaff!). I went with her recommendation of the mushroom burger, which was satisfiying, if a little mushy (might not be extremely possible to construct a firmer mushroom patty than what it was). Our water glasses were never empty and we were never neglected, despite the late hour and the hordes of Vegas revelers that were all looking for their drunken nosh.\nThe Palazzo is a definite repeat for me, and hence, so is GLC, ESPECIALLY during those late-night seshs."

The most recent visit was on Sat, 2/19/11 for brunch.\n\nI've walked into GLC Hungover, Smashed, and Belligerently DRUNK (thank goodness for my guy friends who will yank me out so that I have some sort of dignity left). Although my other senses may be shot, when it comes to food, I still oddly have a keen sense of taste. \n\nGLC is a sister restaurant of Cheesecake Factory. I can see the appeal of GLC; huge portions at affordable prices for the Strip. Call me a food snob, but I'm not a fan of food chains since they tend to have a \"quantity over quality\" mentality so you can take my review w/ a grain of salt. \n\nW A I T  T I M E:\nWeekend Brunch: 15-20 mins w/ a longer wait for larger parties.\n\nDinner: Never more than 5 mins.\n\nSince I tend to stay out till 4 AM, I've never made it to this Palazzo location since they close at 3 AM, however, the wait times at the Venetian has never been more than 5 mins.\n\nIf you get late night take-out it can take up to 45 mins.\n\nF O O D:\nTIP: STAY AWAY FROM THE ASIAN ENTREES!!!\n\nGrowing up in SF, I'm fortunate to be surrounded by Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, etc restaurants so I hold a certain standard for Asian food that simply CANNOT be found on the Strip. For any taste of authenticity, a quick 8 min cab ride to Spring Mountain Road will satiate your Asian food cravings.\n\n*ZEN NOODLES: DISGUSTING!\n\nThis is GLC's rendition of pho ga (Vietnamese chicken noodle soup) and it's poorly executed. Chopped up rice noodles are placed in a bowl and topped w/ slices of chicken breast. Upon serving, \"Swanson\" chicken broth is poured over. Bean sprouts and Italian Basil (not Thai basil as stated on the menu) are served w/ the noodles. The bean sprouts were not fresh as they were brown.\n\nMy friend's bf had ordered this dish and mind you, he EATS a lot and is ALWAYS hungry, but after one bite, he spit out the Zen Noodles and decided to sleep instead. I was curious and took one bite and it was disgusting; the noodles were mushy, the chicken dry, and the broth tasted like watered-down Swanson's broth. GLC is better off serving an instant pho bowl from the local Asian market. \n\n*CARAMEL CHICKEN & SHAKING BEEF: MEH!\n\nI know better than to order Asian food at American chains, however, every time I'm in Vegas, I have this weird ravenous craving for Asian food on the day we're about to leave.  \n\nThe CARAMEL CHICKEN is obviously from a frozen bag as the pieces are overly battered and then slathered w/ a slimy sauce. The chicken was so heavily coated w/ the syrupy sweet sauce that it was like eating thick syrup with fried batter pieces. \n\nAs for the SHAKING BEEF, the beef was tender but was more reminiscent of eating beef fajitas (w/ the grilled onions and bell peppers) b/c it was missing the tangy and pepperiness from the lemon pepper sauce that authentic shaking beef is normally served with.\n\nThe long grain rice was too dry and a little undercooked as if it was made from a box of Microwaveable Uncle Ben's.\n\nIf you have certain standards for Asian food, STICK w/ AMERICAN CLASSICS like Pancakes, Omelets, Burgers and Sandwiches which I've never had a problem with. Nothing mind-blowing or note-worthy, just standard diner fare kicked up a notch.\n\nI have tried the FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES which Yelpers have raved about but it has scarred my vision of what Fried Chicken & Waffles should be and taste like.  One would think it would be combo of sweet, savory and crisp and soft...\n\nThe belgium waffle lacked a crispy exterior and was more soggy than anything. It was topped w/ over breaded fried chicken tenders that was very bland. Unless I drenched the chicken and waffles w/ the pecan honey butter sauce, it was like eating dry fried batter (chicken) and wet cardboard (waffles).\n\nS E R V I C E:\nSlow and inconsistent.\n\nThe times I've been during brunch, it took about 15-20 mins to get our food which is fair, but during late-nights it can take over 30 mins.\n\nWhat grinds my gears is the service we encountered during brunch last Sat, 2/19/11. Half of us wanted to order from the breakfast menu and the other half from the lunch menu. It was 10:53 AM and we asked the waitress if we could place our orders in for the lunch menu and she said, \"No, you have to wait until 11:00 AM\". Fine, so 11:02 AM rolls by and we placed our order. \n\n3 mins later, I see other waitresses bringing out entrees from the lunch menu so clearly they were allowed to place their orders in but we weren't. This may not be a big deal, but if you let some patrons do it, you have to be consistent and let EVERYONE do so. And when you're hungover, starving, and in need of food to absorb the copious amounts of alcohol in your stomach, every MINUTE counts!!!"

My recommendations include the miso salmon, the grilled veggie pizza, Chipotle avocado burger, the spaghettini with clams, and the calamari.  The calamari merits its own sentence--we're talking squid, rock shrimp (think mini shrimp tempura), zucchinis, and onions.  For the price, it's basically the best calamari you'll ever get.\n\nNow, the Palazzo location has better desserts (the menu is almost entirely different).

Basically, it was a tiny piece of bread (what you would eat with bruschetta) with a small scoop of tuna salad on top.  \n\nThe tortilla soup was yum.

            "review": "My husband and I heard this restaurant was the Cheesecake Factory's sister restaurant, which is one of our favorite places to eat, and were very excited to eat here. Boy was our thinking way off from the truth! We sat down in the bar area and our booth was right next to a glass wall. You are sitting on the other side of other diners and it was very uncomfortable having them stare at your food and you while you ate. Of course it was hard for us to not look and stare as well. The set up was very poor. We both decided to order the same meal, the lunch portion of pasta telephono and salad. Everyone around us received fresh bread (as we saw everyone next to us through the glass wall) I guess our waitress decided we didn't need it. Our salads arrived and i got the house salad with ranch, which was pretty good. My husband order the caesar salad. It came with whole leaves and spicy caesar dressing, so spicy my husband couldn't even eat it. And who wants to cut their salad with a knife and fork? When we got our pasta it was completely dried out on the top and the pasta sauce was runny. The noodles wouldn't even hold the pasta sauce. In the middle of my husband eating, he immediately said he didn't feel well, went to the bathroom and got sick. For the rest of the day he was so sick to his stomach! This place is awful and the food is really poor quality. If you're looking for an extensive and creative menu you might as well hit the real thing and go to the Cheesecake Factory."

            "review": "note: this review is for the restaurant in the Palazzo\n\nWe probably never would have come here for dinner, due to the fact that they have locations in both the Venetian(24 Hr) & Palazzo. That alone, might lead you to assume that it's probably a bit on the pricey side. Actually, it's surprisingly affordable & in the $$ price range.\n\nGold, marble & metal finishes, amber colored glass & faint candle-like lighting accent every inch of this palatial cafe. This place is the classier (& better looking) sister restaurant to The Cheesecake Factory.\n\nIf you're indecisive when it comes to ordering, I suggest you leave ordering to someone else, 'cause the menu is an extensive 12 pages-or-so of food, drinks & desserts. There is so much stuff here, that there has definitely got to be something on the menu to \"Palazzo yo' azzo!\"\n\nFrom the \"Things to Share\" (or not) menu -\n\nAsian Nachos - A scoop of Spanish rice w/ black beans & corn, circled by 8 oversized pieces of crispy wonton style \"nacho\" chips. Topped with chicken, peanuts, sweet spicy peanut & creamy wasabi dressings. Some pieces could have gone easier on peanut sauce, though. But the other pieces - Wow! An Asian fiesta explosion in your mouth!\n\nCrispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls - Served with a bowl of fresh lettuce, shredded carrot & mint sprigs. Wrap one of the 6 crispy fried spring rolls in a lettuce leaf with carrots & mint, then dip it in the sauce. So refreshingly tasty! A definite, \"Get this!\"\n\nDouble-Cheese Mini Burgers - There is no kids menu here, so my little one got this. \"You call those mini?\" Each one of the 4 sliders are enough for 1 little one, so share, if you want to. They each come with lettuce a slice of tomato & pickle.\n\nCrispy Ahi Sushi Roll - These were okay, not so special, but did hit the spot. Each of the 6 spicy tuna rolls are crisp tempura fried, served with Asian greens & a spicy-hot soy-chili dipping sauce.\n\nSunday Night Pasta (served everyday) - Tender beef short rib & steak pieces slow cooked with mushrooms, garlic & Parmesan cheese then served on spaghetti pasta. Try to imagine large juicy pieces of beef tossed in pasta. This is a very generously portioned, hearty & meaty dish. The sauce is less tomato marinara, and more rich meaty-meat sauce. Did I mention, it's meaty?\n\n\"Baked to Order Desserts\" menu -\nIf you like freshly baked, warm cookies, order the Chocolate Chip Pecan. They will bake these on order, so order them with your entrees. They come boxed to-go, so you can bring up to the room. Other baked-on-order goods - Chocolate Cake, Beignet & Apple Pie to name a few. I love munching on warm cookies in the room... (the chocolate chip kind!)\n\nService was great. Our server Ronnie, was friendly, helpful & very attentive to our table. Even with a little-late cookie order & an extra order to-go, he did an excellent job accommodating our requests. An overwhelming selection & variety of items on the menu in an extravagant not-so cafe-like setting. I think I'll skip the sister restaurant next time, 'cause after coming here, that other place just seems a little \"cheesy\" now."

I usually sit at the bar because it's fast and convenient for me, I'm usually in and I'm out within 40 minutes. This time around wasn't the case. Although their food is amazing, always so filling, their customer service was not all that great today. Maybe our server Christopher (Filipino, with glasses) is new that's why he wasn't so attentive, but regardless, you're working at a casino on the strip.\n\nAnyways, as soon as we ordered I let him know we work at the casino and he asked for our ID cards. Which is weird because they never really ask us, because we have our casino badges on. \n\nGot our food, we ordered the lunch special of a small pizza and a side of salad. Mine was perfect, I had the bbq chicken pizza and my coworker ordered the margarita pizza, which was a little burnt. Oh well, it happens. \n\nSoon as we got the check, we left. I normally like going when my regular server John is working. He's always so helpful and even suggests new things on the menu. I hope Christopher improves his services, that way it won't matter which server I get."

You wouldn't even be able to tell they were a chain until you looked at the take out bag and realized it looked eerily familiar to the Cheesecake Factory's design ... oh hey, that's their parent chain. \n\nFood? Right on and HUGE portions. \n\n- Their salad & lunch pasta deal is perfect for a big helping of delicious pasta and a nice small side salad.\n-  Even their non-alcoholic drinks are delicious, I got some berry fizz thing blended with 3 kinds of berries and mixed with Sprite and soda. It came to my table flaunting itself like a giant blended tropical drink with skewers of strawberries and pineapple. \n- Asian wonton nachos were decadent but I could only stomach one or two. Deep fried pieces of wonton are smothered with chicken, peanut sauce and wasabi drizzle. Intenseeee. \n\nShout out to our lovely waiter (can't remember his name anymore) but after politely asking why we were in Vegas for the weekend, he came back with two birthday plates of a simple but elegant dessert. Big birthday \"cards\" of crispy sweet phyllo dough were presented to us with a dash of whipped cream and sprinkles complete with a lit candle. Absolutely unexpected, especially in the middle of the day and he really made us feel special for being there! \n\nThanks for having a great selection of food and such wonderful service, especially for a chain restaurant."

This is my favorite dish here.\n\nI've tried an extensive part of the menu and all have been nice, but I still stick to my favorite Indochine. \n\nI come mainly for the beignets. The other location in Venetian doesnt do beignets so you have to come to the Palazzo location for them!! I found that out the sad way of being psyched for some and I had to settle on cakes for dessert at the Venetian one. Beignets are crispy outside and soft and eggy interior  with 3 sauces: raspberry, chocolate and vanilla cream. I tend to like doing the creme mixed with raspberry sauce the best. Chocolate is good and rich so I tend to mix it with the creme sauce as well. To me the combo is better than eating each sauce by itself. Takes 20 minutes to make so order this when selecting entrees or youre SOL at the end of the meal unless you sit and wait.\n\nLong time ago they had bomb napoleons with fresh fruit and all the locations took it away. Boo! They did it right so its a shame they pulled it.\n\nI think for the dessert alone I will say I'm a fan and give it 4 stars."

I was happy that the large prices corresponded with large portions.\n\nI had requested that my hash browns and corned beef to be extra crispy, and it didn't disappoint. The corned beef was plentiful, in toothsome but tender chunks that complimented the fluffy scrambled eggs. The crispy texture of the hash browns was a nice contrast. All I needed was a few dashes of ketchup and I was good. I wiped the plate clean.\n\nI had a few bites of my wife's seafood salad and it was pretty good. Everything is nicely lined up and cut up into uniform pieces. There was a good amount of seafood chunks. Service was prompt and easy going, and we were in and out of there after finishing our food.

We had pork ribs, salmon with three different sauces, Mediterranean mahi mahi, and the house vinaigrette salad. While we waited, the bread came out. We mainly ate the insides of the bread since the outer part was too tough. When our food finally arrived, we dug in. The only downside was the mahi mahi which was a little too dry.

I think the only bad thing is that it closes from 2am-6am daily, but for me, heading back to my room each morning around 6am, it was perfect.\n\nI am well aware they have the $18.95 breakfast buffet, but as far as myself, none of the food on their buffet appeals to me, and so both the mornings I decided to get a late night cap, I went for the Chicken & Waffles combo one morning, and the next morning I went for the Caramel Banana-Nut French Toast.\n\nI am from LA, so I am spoiled by the original Roscoe's as far as Chicken & Waffles. I prefer my chicken with bone, not boneless tenders; and that's what you get here at the Grand Lux Cafe-- Chicken tenders & Waffles. Granted, at 6am, after a long night of drinking and partying, anything warm/hot will do you good, but like I said, I was expecting an actual piece of chicken breast and a wing, or something of the sort. The chicken was alright, and the waffle was great. \n\nThe second time I visited the Grand Lux, I ordered the Caramel Banana-Nut French Toast. Man, I don't know their toast recipe, but boy was it finger lickin' good! The portions, as has been mentioned on here, are HUGE! So huge that I wasn't able to finish either of the breakfast items I ordered, but especially not the French Toast. This is some super large and thick toast, not like your home-made variety. I must say, the toast, with the caramel and the nuts made this by far one of the best meals I had in my five day trip to Las Vegas.\n\nThis was my first time staying at the Palazzo, and thus the first time I ever bothered with the Grand Lux. I've already booked at the Palazzo again for September, and already know what I'll be ordering when I'm back!"

The balance between the alcohol and the flavor is perfect. \nI ordered an omelette (Baja?) Not too sure the exact name because my mind too occupied by the thought of savoring it and finishing it. Although one of my friends complained about the pork sandwich being too dry, everybody else seems to be content with their order. Oh and speaking of which, they're huge, and this is coming from someone who can eat a cow in a sitting.\nDefinitely coming back to this place."

It's a little different from the usual chicken & waffles since the fried chicken is chicken finger and waffles are your thick Belgian waffles.  It doesn't look like much food but trust, it fills you up!   \n\nI LOVE their beignets.  Came here for lunch once (the only sober time) and didn't really want the soup & sandwich combo most people were having so decided to just get fat and ordered the beignets.  Thought it would only come with a few pieces but it comes in a basket!  4 different kinds of sauces to change things up, and the chocolate sauce is still the top for me.  Raspberry sauce is a close second since I like the tartness!\n\nIt is a great place for breakfast/brunch/lunch and late night.  The menu is huge so it's easy to find something that you'd like.  Not my #1 choice as a dinner spot since there are so many great restaurants around the Strip.\n\nThere's actually another Grand Lux at the Venetian but I'm partial to the Palazzo more.  Maybe it's cause it is slightly newer and I am a huge fan of the high ceiling haha."

Nothing was that great, nothing was that bad, just a forgettable meal.  The Grand Lux Cafe at the Palazzo was just that for me.  Came here for breakfast because we wanted to stay close to the hotel.  After looking at a very uninspired breakfast buffet, we ordered off the menu.\n\nI ordered \"The Best Eggs Benedict\".  Really, that's what it's called on the menu.  I would like them to change the name to  \"Not the Worst Eggs Benedict\".  Eggs were poached nicely, but the ham wasn't anything special.  A big slab of Louis Rich quality ham.  The english muffin was a pretty large compared to the poached egg.  It wasn't very toasted and thus got soggy underneath a pile of hollandaise sauce.  Way too much sauce going on here.  Fortunately it came with a side of hash browns to soak up all the sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#4xIDFoFkv-erhPe8JFuqfw\n\nThe wife had the DeLux Breakfast Sandwich, which came with scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, grilled tomato, and havarti cheese.  I didn't try any of it, but she just kind of shrugged her shoulders when I asked how it was. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#Jst4brxUtnAHaajwiebEDQ\n\nMy brother also wasn't impressed with his Huevos Rancheros.  Fried eggs on top of corn tortillas, black beans, saut\u00e9ed peppers and onions, with cheddar cheese topped with \"spicy\" ranchero sauce.  His biggest problem was that the ranchero sauce had no spice at all, in fact the whole dish was quite flavorless even though it looked nice.  He salvaged his breakfast with the help of tabasco sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#Rmtzr49KIb2JE_Mev2HcGg\n\nThe only hit were the breakfast beignets.  These were excellent.  This might have been the first time having a beignet, where I haven't thought, if only I were at the Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  So often places try to do a knock off of those, but these seemed to be their own thing.  They were piping hot right out of the fryer with just a small amount of powdered sugar on them.  I'm normally a purest and want my beignets with lots of sugar and that's it, but these were served with 4 dipping sauces.  Lots of sugar would have gotten in the way here for dipping. My favorite sauce was sweet milk based, like a more liquid bavarian cream.  The raspberry sauce was also excellent.  Mixing the two sauces even better.  There was also a chocolate sauce and a cinnamon sugar based sauce.  There were at least 8 or 9 beignets in the basket, perfect for sharing.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#pd2HMS9A30TXlwNFPRAXxw\n\nIf it's breakfast time, I would come back for beignets for sure and some coffee, but that's about it.  Not sure about lunch or dinner, you'll have to read other people's reviews on that."

Unfortunately, I had horrible service every time I came here. Since I am a loyal Grand Lux customer, each time something bad happened I decided to give them another shot and yet was let down time and time again. I had several problems with service where my server was not attentive multiple times, mistakes in food ordered, and most importantly dirty utensils. I picked up my glass of water and the whole glass was completely sticky, I sat on a seat full of salt, and my utensils looked used. My food came out incorrectly a couple of times but when you order \"over easy eggs\" please make sure they're runny... my eggs were unfortunately completely hard. It's sad seeing this place go down the drain. I wasn't even here during a busy weekend, and was visiting during the middle of the week. Unfortunately, I'm not completely sure if I would come back here during my next Vegas visit."

I wasn't sure what to expect due to the varied menu but this tasted like something out of an excellent Tex Mex restaurant and the chili sauce had the right spices and flavor. It comes with fries but after several days of Vegas eating I figured a salad might be a good idea so I subbed a side salad w their vinegar dressing at no charge. I also tried the fried pickles which were okay but nothing special and I'd probably skip them next time.\n\nService was friendly and I'll come back here to try more of their menu.

I split an order of pasta with chicken, sundried tomato, and mushrooms with a friend. It might've been because we were all super hungry, but our food seemed to take a little longer than usual to arrive. In the meantime, we were served some complimentary bread, which was pretty average. When the food finally arrived, we dug in. The pasta was good, but standard. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fHM09_y3QX3n4a_bIFbk_w?select=cGx25DEjA8-oulLEDX9NKQ) It was on the greasier side though, and the pasta tasted pretty heavy.

Although we were tucked away in the back corner, the server did not forget about us and attended to us immediately. WARNING: portions are big! The three of us ordered three appetizers and three entrees... lets just say we were extremely full and food coma-ing for awhile.. \n\nAppetizers:\nAsian Nachos- Who even thinks of this stuff! crispy wonton chips with chicken, wasabi cream, cheese, and sweet hot peanut sauce with fried rice in the middle. I don't know if these were made for asians or something but damn were these good! The slight hint of wasabi cream really added to the nachos, and adding the fried rice on top of the chip was super asian and delicious.\n\nBrie Wonton with creamy brie cheese, fresh pineapple, and caramelized onion marmalade- this was okay, i expected better. I didn't taste the pineapple in the wonton, and they left the rind on the brie so the taste was kind of bitter. Sauce was good.\n\nCrispy Pepperoni Mini Pizza- they added parmesan slices on top which really added to the pizza in terms of texture and and flavor. Other than that, regular pepperoni pizza.\n\nEntrees:\nLunch special salad and pasta carbonara- the pasta was bomb. Yeah you can make pasta at home but the bacon bits, chicken and cheese was super flavorful and tasty. The noodles were also cooked well. \n\nHousemade Pierogies- Pierogies are basically potato dumplings which they made by hand, and they added roasted short rib with mushrooms and onions. Yum. Yeah pierogies are plain and heavy and basic, but it's good comfort food and perfect after a long night. \n\nAvocado Chipotle Cheeseburger- this thing was giant. I asked for medium rare and mushrooms instead of peppers, and it was a giant stacked burger. The cheese was melted all over the place (perfectly) and the meat was cooked the way I wanted it. The avocados were chopped (I expected it to be in slices) and it kept falling all over the place. Really messy dish, but good burger and good fries. \n\nOverall this restaurant is perfect as a heavy lunch or dinner. Definitely exceeded my expectations from what I had last time (which I don't really remember). Total came out to be $71, which is pretty fair as we did order a lot of food.. Would definitely come if staying at Palazzo or Venetian after a long night."

I liked the sweet sauce, and how it came with lettuce and carrots. But other than that...pretty pricey for some egg rolls...\n\nMy friend got the Crispy Sesame Tofu. She didn't like it. I tasted it and didnt really like it either. The sauce was...very strange. Had a tangy citrus-y taste, but also a little wasabi-ish spiciness...all with the look and consistency and sweetness of teriyaki sauce.\n\nZen noodle = pho. \n\nPizza: looked ok.

The buffet was pretty pathetic looking, especially considering this is Vegas, land of the endless buffets with all you can eat lobster and pancakes (yes together and yes it's weird). I've seen better breakfast buffets in LA. \n\nWe decided to just order. My fiance ordered an omelette and I ordered cereal. It took forever to get our food and when it arrived it wasn't anything special. Almost everything on the breakfast menu seemed heavy. The only reason we ate here was because we had the breakfast credit from American Express, but honestly, next time I'd rather pay for breakfast and go somewhere decent."

BAD F-EN mistake. everything we order was awful or nasty. Zen Noodles, YUCK!!!!! NO! bland bland bland. better off with chicken noodle soup but THEY DON'T make that. Chicken and Waffles, my friend said it was 'horrific' and 'nasty' i didn't try it but looking at her expressions tells me im better off NOT trying it. seared ahi... wow, is this seriously \"AHI\"?!?!? I had the Pasta with Chicken Tomatoes and Garlic over creamy sauce, the pasta itself was overcooked!!! :( My friend had the Caramel chicken and Sauteed Beef. we aske dher, hey what did you ordered? She said \"awful\" practically renamed her plate. I ordered the Creamy Chicken Soup. CREAMY is a understatement, i took 2 spoonful and gave up! GROSS, creamy... well it was WAY THE HELL beyond creamy because when he cooled it looked like BUTTER! i think they only good plate that no one complained about was Shrimp Scampi. So if you're as unfortunately as us and was forced to eat there because Palazzo and Venetian didn't have any food places opened after 3AM, then order yourself a Shrimp Scampi.. because everything else on the menu is \"HORRIBLE, AWFUL and NASTY\" \n\nService was great, well, how can it possibly be NOT GREAT being that it is in the the Palazzo?? but food wise, walk to DENNY'S!! You'll be better off eatting there."

It's not as pricey as the other ridiculous stores in Vegas, either.  It's open late/early too, which makes it a perfect place to grub after the clubs.  I've never had to wait too long, especially since it's massive inside.  But out of all the buffets (though I'm not much of a buffet girl) and random eateries, I'd have to say this is my favorite.\n\nWhat do I recommend?  Anything, really.  The pasta, pizza, salads, sandwiches...just go with a big group (which you'll probably be in when you're in Vegas, all crammed into that nice hotel) and share everything.  Family style is the way to go, after all.\n\nThe service is also always good, but that's pretty much a given in this city.  The workers are always so cheerful, from the concierge to the bartenders (well, minus the security at the clubs).  Check this place out for a reasonable price and some pretty good food.  Then go to Tao Beach after and get your tan on."

The best way to compromise was to pick a restaurant with plenty of diverse choices on its menu and the Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 had fit this bill. \n\nTo wind down from this road trip, we needed some booze. I had originally wanted a beer but this was one area of the menu lacking a lot of selection, so I opted to go with a glass of Chianti instead. My wife drank the mojito which she absolutely loved. In fact, she wanted to go back here for the mojito alone. \n\nFor starters, we decided to go with the crabcakes along with an order of house salad. The crabcakes were fried lump crab meat and came with a side of mustard aioli sauce for dipping. I thought these crabcakes were alright. I normally like them lightly fried and these came out extra crispy from the fryer. It was not my idea of a great crabcake but it was not bad either. My sentiment was the same for the house salad. \n\nThe pepperoni pizza was oval shaped and cooked on an artisan flatbread in a wood fire stove. Just like the crabcakes, it came out extra crunchy from being slightly overcooked. And just like the crabcakes, it was about an average pizza. I would have liked more cheese and tomato sauce to counter balance this crispiness. \n\nMy wife's trout was unexpectedly great. We were worried after the pizza and crabcakes this would come out dry from being overcooked.  However, they did a terrific job seasoning it and grilling it to perfection. It was very moist and flavorful. The trout was served with a side of white rice and some broccoli. \n\nThe service here was awesome. Rating the service alone I would give our waiter five stars. He was delightful and attentive the entire time. \n\nMy wife struck gold with her entr\u00e9e and drink and maybe I do the same next time by ordering different items from the menu. With that said, Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 definitely deserves three stars."

Everything was delicious!  The portions were large enough that had we not eaten with our eyes instead of our stomachs, we could have easily shared plates.\n\nLest you think I found this place delicious due to sleep deprivation or a hangover, I came back for snack/dinner in a much more sober state.

My wife complained (to us) of her food being too salty. \nA coke was $3.75 as was some bottled water. We didn't order alcohol and we got out with a $98 tab, including the tip. Not too expensive but not very delicious either. We had a show to catch next door in The Palazzo so we didn't go to Olives at the Bellaggio where we had made a reservation and where last time we had great food. I DON\"T recommend The Grand Lux."

After the club, early in the wee morning.. we stumbled drunk into the Grand Lux in the Palazzo since it was closer than walking to the Venetian. The waiters seemed more than happy to assist our drunken selves which was good.. hah. The group had burgers and salads and it was delicious.. or it could have been because we were all tired and drunk and any food was good food. Nonetheless this was the place to be at after a long night of drinking and dancing in Viva Las Vegas."

It's menu is identical to that of The Cheesecake Factory, so if you're from an area with this restaurant chain, you're probably better off trying somewhere new to eat in Las Vegas. However, if you're staying in the Palazzo and are craving something different than room service, this is a great option! It's just a few steps away from the guest suite entry. They tend to underestimate a bit on order time, so be prepared to wait. Also, after midnight they stop serving most of the menu and only offer burgers."

We wanted a convenient and relatively inexpensive meal before our red eye flight home.  We had a wonderful, attentive, friendly waiter.   \n\nMy husband and I each order the cream of chicken soup and a salad - the wedge for me, which is considered a \"small\" salad though it is literally half of a head of lettuce, and my husband had the roasted beet salad.  Everything was very good and came out quickly.  \n\nThe waiter had alerted us to their made-to-order desserts when we first arrived, so we order the beignets.  The were amazing!  The came out super hot with three dipping sauces - raspberry, chocolate, and creme anglaise (maybe with bourbon in it?).  There were so many beignets!  I ended up over eating because they were so good I just couldn't help myself.  The server (also friendly) who delivered our dessert recommended mixing the sauces and boy was she right - the raspberry and chocolate together were to die for.  \n\nThis was also the only time on our entire trip that a manger stopped by our table to see how things were.  We made sure to tell him what a wonderful job our waiter had done and how happy we were after having bad service at so many \"fine dining\" restaurants previously in the week.  He was also very nice. \n\nThe entire meal (with drinks) ended up being $70 (with an almost 30% tip), money well spent!"

Everything about this place reminds you of Cheesecake Factory, but with better decor!!  It's right downstairs in the Palazzo when you enter its casino from the escalators.  Good spot to hit when you are staying across the street at TI hotel also.  They were very quick to seat us and we were able to sit all together in a booth.\n\nService was pretty quick since they tried to serve everyone's dishes at the same time.  The place wasn't overly crowded for a lunchtime meal, which was awesome since we were starved.  \n\nI ordered the pasta carbonara.  It wasn't too creamy and too thick, which made it a bit lighter.  Not enough bacon pieces or meat though.  Perfect dish to fill your stomach up after a drunking night escapade!\n\nDon't forget!!  There are LUNCH PORTIONS!!!

After having one of these, I decided to eat my Waffle first, so I could satisfy that urge.  The Waffle was very good.  After that, I was only able to eat 3 more Beignets before I had to cry uncle and give up....it was too much for me to handle by myself....LOL  They were tasty, just too large of a portion.  \n\nThe Coffee didn't help balance the sweet taste of my breakfast.  It wasn't worth $3.95....it was actually terrible and tasted like Folgers...yuck.  Save your money and buy Coffee elsewhere.\n\nOverall, the breakfast was pretty good.  I like it better than lunch and dinner menu items here.....so I'm raising it to 4 Stars from 3 for that.  Next time, I will bring my Wife or a guest to help with the Beignets.\n\nReturn Factor - 75% (breakfast only)"

I went to this one because it was being paid for by someone else and I  wanted to give it another shot.  I ordered the whole egg omolette with a side of hash browns and sausage.  I wasn't  expecting much as it is the  only breakfast food i go out for and it is  hard to screw up.\n\nThe food came exactly as ordered and rather quickly for a restaurant of this size.  I usually expect nice and quick service from places that  charge the prices they do here and was not let down.  The person in our section (didn't  quite catch the name but it was a slight older, ethnic looking gentleman with bald hair)  was very nice throughout the entire experience and always came to check in on us, make sure we had full cups and were satisfied with our meals.\n\nThe only part of the entire experience that really didn't  sit well with me was at the very end when i was trying to get to go boxes.  I don't  know if it is customary  to box up the food for me but it was something that i would not want again.  My hashbrowns were placed under my omolette.  That would be fine if there wasn't ketchup all over the hashbrowns.  I'm sure i will probably end up eating them after i have a few beers tonight but would prefer to not have to resort  to that.\n\nThe atnosphere here was alright.  Fairly noisy which is to be expected but the people coming in fresh off a night  of drinkiny qnd partying really didn't  make for a good experience out the gate.  Random screaming made me wonder whether someone was proposing, won the lottery or just sold their tech startup (none of those were the case though).  I could do without that and that was a major factor in my rating decision.  I will probably attempt to eat here again (maybe earlier as i started at 12:00 PM) but it probably will  not be soon unless it is free again."

It's an American Asian fusion cuisine and I've eaten here several times. The Asian nachos is unique and is a crispy wonton with mozzarella cheese, wasabi, chicken and a sweet goner sauce. The garlic shrimp pasta is good too and does not feel too heavy. The Indochine shrimp and chicken pasta is a curry dish with rice and comes a bit spicy. There's burgers, sandwiches and an alcohol list to choose from. It's in a nice Hotel and casino too."

Here, they do a wonderful job of maximizing a diverse variety of menu items, while still maintaining the highest standard of quality.  You can order anything from breakfast to Asian to Italian to American gourmet influenced meals. Some of my favorites include the Avocado Chipotle Burger and the Wild Mushroom Burger.\n\nThe atmosphere and decor is lovely.  High ceilings and a clean open feel make for a very pleasant ambiance.  The service has always been excellent each time I've been no matter how large our party was.\n\nThe best part is....you get all of that goodness for pretty reasonable prices."

            "review": "This is the second Grand Lux I've been to in Vegas, which is a little funny because I never really go to the one in L.A.  I guess it makes sense if you think about it - so many of the restaurants in Vegas require some major spending, and it's hard to justify eating out like a baller for every meal.  Besides, sometimes you just want to get a simple lunch where you can walk down in normal clothes with a hangover clear on your face.  L.A. has lots of options for that; the Palazzo has Grand Lux.\n\nI came here for just such a lunch with seven of my girlfriends during my bachelorette weekend.  We arrived around two o'clock and got seated right away.  Service was pretty slow, considering, but it was polite enough, and we weren't in a terrible hurry.  The interior - eh, I won't bother describing it.  If you're looking to eat at Grand Lux, chances are you've been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Same idea.\n\nI shared a Sonoma salad with Melissa K., my maid of honor.  Decent salad, big enough to share, with crispy greens, grilled chicken, avocado, bacon, fresh corn, sweet dates, golden raisins, onions, goat cheese, and glazed walnuts.  We got the hazelnut-mustard vinaigrette on the side.  I swapped a bit with June K. who ordered the seared rare ahi tuna salad.  This one came with romaine, radicchio, frisee, and avocado, tossed with a vinaigrette and piled high with seared ahi.  The tuna was pretty good.  If I come back to Grand Lux I might go for that one next time.\n\nLunch was nice and light, which was good - the rest of the itinerary included pool time, dinner, and club time, during which I would have to wear both a swimsuit and a dress I needed help getting into.  Grand Lux Cafe wasn't the most eventful part of the weekend, but it was a serviceable restaurant.  I'm glad it was an available option."

This time trying two new items: chicken royale (very plain and boring battered chicken pressed) and short ribs (amazingly tender, melted in my fork, an absolutely delicious dish). Topped with some of the best, softest sourdough bread, and you have yourself a great Vegas meal. I highly recommend this spot to any tourist looking for that perfect dinner under $25/30. And it's open 24 hours!"

Also they have desserts - like the beignets - which take half an hour to make (or so they say) so you should order them at the beginning of your meal with your entr\u00e9e. Anyways in addition to the beignets, I ordered the chicken and waffles per other yelpers suggestions. Luckily they still served some of the breakfast items even though we went almost near dinnertime. So while we waited for food, they had some complementary warm bread. Mmm. Finally when the food came out, it all looked super delicious. For my dish, the waffle was really light, which helped in trying to finish the meal. It's not very cakey/bready like how it is at coffee shop breakfast places. So I liked it. The chicken was like mini chicken strips - white meat, breaded and no bones. Not exactly up to roscoe's standards but delicious all the same. I also got to try the short rib tacos, the Sunday night pasta and another pasta dish I don't remember. The Sunday night pasta is the bomb and it should be for $18. The portion is huge - enough for two people at least. And they say they make the pasta fresh every day and it's topped with this sauce that will satisfy any meat lover. It was even great, cold, later that night after a few drinks and I don't usually like cold foods. The other pasta dish was just ok and the short rib had this sweet flavor that was a bit odd. My chicken and waffles was like $14 so prices are about what you would pay at cheesecake factory. Service was eh - waitress would disappear or long periods of time."

The buttery, flaky crust complimented the tangy nuttiness of the brie and the sweetness of the dates so well. I enjoyed an heirloom and avocado salad that was so rich in flavor and texture. The heirlooms were slightly acidic and paired perfectly with creamy avocado and robust french dressing! I even indulged in a couple mai tais that completed my meal perfectly.

We expected to like the beignets the most as we have had them elsewhere, but we ended up liking the butter cake the best. We would get both the beignets and butter cake again but would likely try either the warm sticky bun bread pudding, key lime pie or \"the best\" carrot cake instead of the red velvet cake next time we are in town.\n\nWe used to the Grand Lux Cafe at the Beverly Center for dessert after dinner when it was still open. We would always get the beignets because it is one of the few places that do beignets well in Los Angeles. On our recent trip to Las Vegas, we stopped by to get the beignets which were again very good. They are a bit crunchy on the outside with a soft hollow interior, sprinkled with confectioner's sugar on top. I like them plain without using the sauces, but they do come with a vanilla custard sauce, raspberry sauce and chocolate sauce if you are so inclined. They take about 20 minutes and come out warm, so order them early if you know you are going to get them. \n\nThe warm butter cake was surprisingly good, probably on par with the butter cake at Mastro's. This one is served with fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream. The butter cake comes out warm with a slightly crisp outside and a warm, soft, rich interior. This actually turned out to be our favorite dessert.\n\nAs for the red velvet cake, there is nothing to write home about here. It is served with the typical cream cheese frosting, but the cake itself was not that flavorful. You have definitely had better red velvet cake elsewhere. You should go right past this dessert and try something else."

Speaking of the menu, there are SO many different choices to be made as I shifted through pages upon pages as if the menu were a small book. The portions of the food is rather large so keep that in mind if you have a group of people with you.\n\nI came here with a friend of mine who was about to move out of Las Vegas and I wanted to go somewhere nice to eat for the both of us. The restaurant was not too hard to find and there was hardly any wait time to sit down at a table. I liked the interior decor of the Grand Lux Cafe, it was elegant but not too overdone. Both of us seemed to enjoy our entrees - I had the Chicken Parmesan and my friend had the Carolina BBQ Pork Sandwich. There were no major complaints from either of us with the food + service.\n\nMy Chicken Parmesan was a little more than half done, I guess they weren't kidding about the large portions. =)"

The sandwich was probably the tastiest of the bunch.\n\nI thought both salads were really doused with dressing which made them soggy and inedible. My fried chicken with waffles was basically a pile of chicken tenders on a dry belgian waffle--Roscoe's does a better job, albeit with much less ambiance.\n\nWe pre-ordered the beignets with 3 dipping sauces because the waiter said it would take at least 20 mins to prepare. They arrived as soft, airy, puffy balls of pastry. While they were not half-bad, that these were not even trying to be the real thing.\n\nAll in all, decent place to take a group because the menu's got something for everyone."

Both my friend and I got the corned beef hash which we did not like.  We both had the same complaint that the meat was dry so and with a bit of potatoes mixed in.

The portion was huge and I didn't finish all of it.\n\nThe next day I had eggs benedict florentine with my honey vanilla latte, sooo good. Their hollandaise sauce is very flavorful and the portion is just right.\n\nThe food can get pricey, especially with drinks and sides of bacon and such - orange juice here is $5.50 (what a rip!!). The second morning BF got the buffet for $15, which comes with as many drinks as he wanted, so he got OJ and soda for other people at the table so we wouldn't have to pay. \n\nOur bill averaged $65 both mornings, and that was for 3 people...so it's about $20 per person, which is a bit much for breakfast, but you're in Vegas, live a little!"

We had a huge group and they quickly accommodated us. It was also a weird time to eat so it wasn't crowded or anything, but it wasn't like we were the only ones there either. \n-Food took 20+ minutes to get but our party size was around 12 people or so.

Avocado portions were generous (that's what I'm talking about). Chicken wasn't too dry. Salad dressing was perfection.

Vegas is the land of seafood buffets and supposedly *good* buffets in general. Yet, somehow, we ended up in Grand Lux. TWICE. So bitter. \n\nThe food was ... well, it was Grand Lux. It wasn't horrific, but it wasn't anything that you would remember or even think about a day later. Also, since the portions are unnecessarily huge (and, I assure you, you are paying for every ounce of it), we had leftovers so we jokingly asked the waiter if we could put it in the Grand Lux fridge. He said sure and that we could come back and get it later. Total fake-out.\n\nWe came back the next day and asked a different waiter for our food. He looked confused and told us that wasn't allowed at all (health violation?). So, I ask, First Waiter, why would you trick a bunch of tourists with promises of potential leftovers? That's just wrong. And mean. And I don't like Grand Lux. Go eat at a buffet. I heard the one at Rio was good, but I wouldn't know, because I was eating at Grand Lux *sob*"

We were going to come here for lunch the day prior but our group was too big and the wait was forever.

That gives you the general description, price, atmosphere, of the place. \n\nWe got there in time for breakfast foods which they serve til 11am. I shared the Belgian waffles with strawberry with a side of scrambled eggs. My friend got the chillaquilles which were AMAZING. I've never had them before, and I'm not sure how they taste like anywhere else. But they were really good at this place! It's like tortilla chips topped with eggs, salsa, avocado, cheese, beans, etc. It was really good. \n\nThe server we had was great. Very friendly, talkative, and quick. However, I have one tip for the hostess stand. Apparently, the lead host takes your name and how many people in your party and finds a table on the POS system and probably because it's such a big restaurant and there are many hostesses who seat guests and the lead host doesn't have the time to stand there and wait for an actual host to come up and verbally tell them where to seat the guests, they print out a receipt thing that tells the hostess where to seat the guests. This is fine but every time she printed it out, she put it on the counter that stands between the guests and herself. So many of the guests, reach for the ticket. And she has to tell each one \"no this is not for you\" / \"this is for the hostess\" etc and she looked irritated each time she said it. So maybe putting it somewhere where the guests don't reach for it would make sense.."

It was my husband and friend's birthday, so we all decided to go to Vegas. A few of us got free rooms at Palazzo, so I figured why not have dinner at Grand Lux? It was perfect for a group of 25 people. I called about a few weeks before our arrival to make a reservation. When I called in, I was told I had to call their special relations rep, Rich to make a reservation for such a large party. I called him at least twice before I got a response back a week later..He asked me to e-mail him my info, I did, it was confirmed. DONE! \n\nApparently, that was not enough for them not to fuck up. I came about 30 minutes earlier to speak with them about adding a birthday cake. They directed me to the gentleman who was going to be out waiter, he was very nice by the way and I wish I wrote down his name. That was the last I saw of him though. When we arrived at our reservation time, I was told that I had a reservation for 11 people. Obviously if you looked behind me, I had more then that. I showed them the e-mail, told them who I spoke with, the entire situation leading up to that night. They asked us to step aside for a moment while they figured it out. \n\nOnce again, they asked me to show me the e-mail. I showed them. Then they asked if I'm sure I didn't book it with Venetian. I said no, look at the e-mail. And IF I did, why would you have me down for 11 people?? They proceeded by stating that my reservation was only for 11 people and they had to make adjustments. I was pissed off by then so I didn't make any comments. 10 minutes later, they informed us that there was seating in the very back for us but we wouldn't be sitting on the same table. We were hungry, so we just agreed. \n\nNow onto the actual service during the meal. Our waitress (I also forgot to get her name), had a bi*ch face the entire time. She kept giving us attitude, forgot alot of our orders, took forever to get our refills, she was the worst. \n\nLuckily we still love Palazzo since we stay here at least every other month. But we're going to have to rethink this place and just walk over to Venetian Grand Lux. I would def not recommend this place to family & friends anymore."

We also got calamari and a Cobb salad.  The calamari was good and the salad was ok.  Overall this is a solid place, where you can escape some of the higher priced restaurants in the casino."

I had the Zen Noodles, because I was a little tired of heavy food by this point in the trip.  It was basically a variation on pho, complete with cilantro, sprouts, and chicken, all served up in a tasty chicken-based broth.  They even provided sriracha.  I was satisfied.

They cooked the burger perfectly, which is nice because most places won't do a medium-rare burger despite it being a scientifically proven fact that medium-rare is the only way to consume a burger for maximum taste. The burger was amazing. I'd easily put it in my top 10 burgers of all-time. And even though the thing will probably cost me several days of my life, I don't regret eating it at all and would do it many times over again.

The Grand Lux Cafe was one of the first signs we saw while walking in the casinos, so we decided to just go for it foregoing checking out yelp reviews because, at that point, we just needed to eat!\n\nFirst, regarding the staff service... Even working that late (or early?) and on Christmas day, the staff were really nice and accommodating. The service here was really good.\n\nTrivia: While waiting for our orders, I noticed a lady having a carry-out and the restaurant's to-go bag looked awfully very much the same as the Cheesecake Factory! So, after some googling, I got to find out that the Grand Lux Cafe is created by the founder of the Cheesecake.\n\nSo, for our food, we really enjoyed it and the servings are huge! My mom ordered the Garlic Shrimp pasta ($19.50). It was really good! It has lots of shrimp, heirloom tomatoes, and some veggies.. I forgot what it was but it was good! I think I ate at least a third of her dish. Hehe.\n\nI ordered the Grilled Steak sandwich ($13.95), and you can choose your side of salad or fries. The steak was really savory and tender. The sandwich also has heirloom tomatoes, caramelized onions, white cheddar cheese, horseradish sauce and lots of yummy nutty arugula on a toasted artisan roll. Sooooo good!\n\nMy brothers both had chicken and waffles ($13.50). I didn't get to try it but their plates were all wiped out clean so I guess they really liked it too. Hehe. \n\nMy brothers also had orange juice, which came on quite a small wine glass. There was no price for the OJ on the menu, but we didn't bother to ask since we didn't think it's gonna be more than $3. The bill came and that small glass of OJ came out to be $5.95! Wow, that was almost half the price of my awesome sandwich! I wished they just had water since it was my turn to pay. Hmpf!\n\nOverall, the dining experience here was good and relaxed. I would come back again if I am in the Palazzo and get tired and lost after playing from all the slot machines outside to help make me feel better! :)"

I've had their Korean short rib tacos, tuna ceviche, chicken wraps, various entrees...everything is very good.  Then what's the problem???  THE SERVICE SUCKS.\n\nMy most recent stay was the worst.  Stephanie was our waitress.  I honestly think I knew more about their menu than she did.  I asked her what gluten free options there were and she didn't know.  I asked her if she had grilled shrimp, she said I can order fried shrimp and not have them fry it in breading.  (Uh, what?)  I asked if she can make the salmon piccata without the sauce and she said they can just cook a chicken breast with no seasonings and sauce.  (What?  I just asked you about salmon, but you're telling me to eat chicken?)  Then I asked her if I could use the rice noodles in their \"Zen\" noodle dish with a butter, cheese or cream sauce for the kiddo, and she said I could use Spaghettini or Fettuchini instead.  (What?  I'm trying to order gluten-free!)  So needless to say, all we got were french fries for the kiddo.  Yeah...because she didn't know if anything on the menu was gluten free or not, nor could she tell us if the kitchen could make anything gluten free except a season-less, sauce-less chicken breast.  Sounds tasty.  (roll-eyes)\n\nAnyway, when I was ordering food, I pointed to the Korean short rib tacos and said I would like to order the Korean short-rib tacos.  They bring out Mexican chicken tacos.  Um...  Then it takes them forever and a half to get us the right order, despite \"the manager\" putting a rush on it.  \"The manager\" never stopped by to say a word to us.\n\nThen as we are trying to leave, we had finished all our food and we're flagging her down, and it takes her about 15 minutes AFTER we were done eating for her to bring us the check.  Then it takes her another 15 minutes to come back to take payment.  So basically 30 minutes of our lives were wasted for no apparent reason.  Worst waitress ever.  She reminded me of Phoebe from \"Friends.\"\n\nP.S. We overheard her taking the order of the people behind us.  They asked her what sodas they had that were caffine-free.  She said, \"um, Coke Zero? We also have iced tea.\"  Really?  BOTH of her recommendations had caffeine in them."

We both ordered Salmon Picatta which took 20+ minutes to be served (tables after us were getting served faster). When the meal was finally presented it was cold, so I asked to speak to a manager. A rotund man approached the table and asked what was wrong, so we told him. He then said, would we like him to take back the meals and heat them up for us? Are you kidding?! Yeah, right, like we want our two cold meals zapped in a microwave. He should have offered to remake the meals; unfortunately, that was his only solution. That trip was the last one I will ever make to a Grand Lux Cafe ANYWHERE! This chain is owned by the Cheesecake Factory and should have much higher levels of service, quality and management. I hope the Venetian & Palazzo don't renew their leases when they expire--the restaurant doesn't speak well for the hotel which is one of the best on the strip.

There were so many empty tables...but They did not tell me why we needed to wait. I assumed they needed to set up our table. two Caucasian women entered into the restaurant after us and they asked for the table. And the server came to them and she got them a table... I told them we were here earlier than them but they told me they walked in blah blah... To me, what she was saying was nonsense... Doesn't make sense to me. They did not say sorry to us... What a service they said.. And The server showed the table and we set. And I told her again about this matter. And she did not response.. So I asked two ladies were having a bar seat. They got the dinning table not seating in the bar... We were upset so we left the restaurant.. Their excuse was not even clear. If that is their mistake and accepted their mistakes, then i would understand. But they did not accept their fault and apologize to us at all. They stared at us when we left the restaurant. Horrible experience I had... I was here to enjoy my vacation...."

The service is very nice and the coffee is reasonable. I would come back here. Note one thing though - this one (in the Palazzo) is NOT open 24 hours, that's only the Grand Lux Cafe in The Venetian. This one opens from 6am to 1am daily.  Update: I had a delicious dinner here also - very nice Avocado and Beet Salad; Greek Salad and good bread. I also enjoyed their Raspberry Cosmopolitan. Totally enjoyable, thank you."

Left to my own resolve and no agenda whatsoever.  WooHoo!!\n\nI saw the Grand Lux Cafe in the in-room publications for the hotel and saw that they had a miso glazed salmon which I totally missed from The Cheesecake Factory (miso glazed SESAME salmon).  Those were the days.\n\nSo I ordered it up along with a Jack and Coke.  That was what caused the one star reduction in my rating.  Too much Coke and not enough Jack.  :)\n\nNot too many people in the place during lunch.  Granted it was 3:30PM when I got there and there are obviously other places to eat but whatever, they all missed out.\n\nThe salmon was prepared perfectly.  Moist enough to flake off at the slightest touch from my fork.  When it met my taste buds, it was like they were old friends getting reacquainted again for the first time...they just melted into each other.  The perfect amount of miso glaze topped off the experience but it didn't end because there was another forkful on it's way.  The filet was a very generous portion and by the end of the meal, I was stuffed.  I opted for the brown rice which was perfect.  The usual nuttiness didn't accompany the rice.  I've had this before at home.  It was a jasmine brown rice which, judging by the size of the grain, it seemed this was jasmine or a member of the same family.  The meal also included stir fry vegetables which were awesome.  Lately I've been in a veggie mood so I'm not sure if this influenced my experience.  Whatever it was, the veggie medley was perfect.  Yellow and red bell peppers, sugar pea snaps, edamame, onions, shitake mushrooms stirred up to perfection!\n\nMake it a point to get here when you get to Sin City and can't decide where of the thousands of choices you have to eat."

They do designate non-smoking areas, which seems to help. It is owned and run by the Cheesecake Factory, but is elegant in its design. Although I have not been to the Cheesecake Factory, it is my understanding that the menu is rather different than that of the Factory.\n\nIt is located on the same floor as the casino in the Venetian and is open 24/7. There is a breakfast menu, lunch dinner menu, and late night menu, the latter which, for obvious reasons, is smaller than the main menu, but still quite good.\n\nThe portions are substantial, so we were able to order one salad and one entree and split them and feel adequately fed. The ingredients were extremely fresh and flavors were understated.\n\nI consider this restaurant a true gem of a find in Las Vegas."

The menu is extensive so you can pretty much satisfy nearly any appetite. Typically if I order off the pasta section, another girl and I could share it pretty easily. There isn't really much of a difference between Grand Lux and The Cheesecake Factory except maybe a slight menu change.

Ive been hearing for years about Grand Lux Cafe here in L.A.,after years & years at the Beverly Center it just closed i thought i had missed out, i didnt know it was a chain restaurant. We went here with just a bit over an hour to eat, we were going to a show. So we didnt have alot of time to totally enjoy the place but our time there was good. It was about 6:30pm so the dinner crowd was there not packed but getting there, we got a table right away.The decor was beautiful. The hostess & our waitress were both professional & attentive. Since we were pressed for time we ordered 3 medium plates from the menu. We nibbled on the bread basket while we waited for our meal which didnt take long at all. All 3 meals were perfectly cooked & just the right size portion. We had a great meal and made it to our 8:00 show on time. Next visit we will make sure and have plenty of time the dessert menu looked scrumptious."

My favorite is the Miso Glazed Salmon...  Total best...  But if you like having more than one item, they have combination dishes...  Two of their regular dishes, just a smaller version paired together to be one dish.  Service is done with a smile and a friendly attitude... and their desserts if you can get that far are cheesecakes from the infamous Cheesecake Factory...  SOOOO YUMMS...  So, even if you don't go for dinner, go for the desserts...  Enjoy..."

I thought I was ordering some fusion noodle dish but instead they served me pho.  And it was a mediocre bowl at that and $13.  That's ridiculous.  Pho is supposed to be dirty and wrong and at MOST $9 with tip.  I could not believe it!  And I had to ask for hoisin sauce.  Thank goodness they at least had that.\n\nOn the flip side, the spinach cheese dip was amazing.  I wish there were more chips but besides that I would have plopped it on anything including my pho."

I love the Miso Salmon and Caramel Chicken combo.  2 nice pieces of salmon, crispy pieces of caramel chicken all atop some stir fried vegetables and  served with steamed rice.  A deal at 19.95 because 2 people can easily share it.  Their desserts are also delicious.  Their Red Velvet cake is the best ever!  My sis and I consider ourselves Red Velvet junkies.  We try that cake everywhere and the Grand Lux wins hands down.  They also serve a pretty mean Banana Cream pie and let me tell you, I can't stand bananas but I can eat this."

It is of course owned by the Cheesecake factory so if you like their cuisine then  you will be in for a similar treat. \nThis place could easily be a 4 or 5 star place for a casual/nice eatery but it seems as if they try to turn some of their food into the food of a much more upscale establishment. This isnt bad necessarily but its often executed not quite as great as they probably hope!\nMaybe i'm too simple but when I order a salad I expect to be able to eat lettuce their caesar is large leaf lettuce, nestled onto each other with sparse dressing and two pieces of cheese and no croutons.. really.. REALLY... its a salad.. cut me some slack. Plus their food isn't as flavorful as cheesecake factory, which I dont consider their food super seasoned soooo... its hit or miss but generally not bad.. \nId go again, but I wont go out of my way to return!"

I believe there is an actual connection between the two, but stepping in here, you'd really see the connection for yourself if you're familiar with the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is very diverse and huge, with a variety of items to choose from. Grand Lux Cafe is located inside of the Palazzo Hotel, which was very convenient for me and my group since that's where we were staying. Great place for us to dine because we were able to just get ready in our hotel room, then go downstairs for dinner before heading out to the clubs or walking the strip. Price is great for what you get; just expect Cheesecake Factory pricing with the same big type of portion size as well! Great for sharing entrees, which is exactly what us 10+ girls did. Everything was really good. I tried a little bit of everything and was quite pleased with it all."

I'm a omelet guy so I like how their omelets are made as an egg wrap, with the ingredients stir fried and placed inside the egg. \n\nOn my recent trip we found out they had an all you can eat breakfast buffet. That got me so excited because it was cheap @ 15 bucks. It had the omelet bar, waffles, moist scramble eggs, sausages, bacon, fruit bar, and assortment of pastries. Best part about the breakfast was that it came with all you can drink Orange Juice, yes its fresh squeezed. Our waitress was so cool she offered cups of OJ and coffee to take with us. That's what I called service. Because of that this place gets 5 stars for going above and beyond what I expected."

A family arrived midway in our dinner but they were too busy looking at their phones so I didn't feel like I was listening in on their conversations.  They also had large booths to accommodate groups of at least 6.\n\nBecause the menu is large, it takes a little while to go through it.  But they also provide complimentary bread to go along with the large portions.  Our server was alright and took our orders, and got us our food.  He told us about a Thanksgiving special but we weren't in the mood for turkey and pumpkin pie.\n\nI ordered the ribs, peanut coleslaw, cornbread, and fries.

I've eaten at Grand Luxe at the Venetian many times before but this was my first time here at the Palazzo location. The establishment is tucked away at the far corner of the Palazzo, right by the Jersey Boy Theater. The atmosphere when we came here was great. It's not as loud as the Venetian location. We were seated at a booth by the entrance and was greeted by a nice server. I ordered the Mushroom burger and the guy ordered a chicken meatball sandwich w/ fries and a side of ranch. We didn't wait too long for our food to come out and it was pretty ok, nothing to get too excited about. My mushroom burger was bland..but i expected that since no meat was involved and it was pretty much just a mushroom patty. They guy said his food was just ok...BUT the fries were stale and cold! on top of that, they forgot to bring out the ranch. We nicely asked the food runner to bring us the side of ranch which we ordered in the very beginning, and he unhappily said, \"Yea\". Like dude I know you hate your job but damn I'm not your homie so don't talk to me like I'm your homie and you can at least smile a little. The worst part about it is that we didn't get the ranch and we didn't see our server until we were done eating. Not even a refill, or \"how's your food?\" or anything. ...We didn't get squat. But just because that happened doesn't mean I should give this place one star.  After all, the food wasn't horrible. We didn't leave the place feeling butt hurt about the service..we just didn't tip as much =D..problem solved. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back here to give it another shot. If you've never had a mushroom burger, you should def try it..just add a little bit of salt. But also keep in mind that since it's a mushroom patty, it falls apart easily so it could get messy. The guy said his chicken meatball sandwich was 'ok' but not the best. They have a good atmosphere here and if you are an indecisive person when it comes to food, you might want to stop here. They have a big selection of food on their menu."

I thought I would be good and order a salad - I got the ahi tuna salad.  The bf went the opposite direction - he got the chicken and waffles.  =)\n\nWe started off with the spinach dip...nothing glorious but it did taste good.  My salad...oh goodness, my salad.  It was ginormous.  It tasted fine...the dressing was actually really nice but it felt like I had three pounds of salad on a plate and it was just too much for me.  The ahi was actually the low point...I thought it would be cooked/seared on the outside but instead the outside was basically seaweed wrapped around.  I probably would not get this again.\n\nThe real champion of the night was the chicken and waffles.  At first, they told us the chicken was actually chicken tenders...the bf made a face at me like, \"what the heck - why called it fried chicken?\"  However, once we tasted it...it was heavenly!  The tenders are amazing...juicy & the breading/battered coating was really yummy.  The waffle was really good too and I was completely jealous our entire meal...kept stealing bites of chicken when I could.  It was a lot of food so the bf obliged.  =)\n\nOverall, I would definitely eat here over and over again.  The food is good, service was friendly - lots of variety, prices are great and it's a good restaurant that's not super fancy but not fast food either."

I had the Grand Lux Burger Melt, which came in parmesan crusted bread (not a burger bun I should add, it was like Ciabatta bread) with a sauce, and fries on the side-- DELICIOUS! One of the best burgers I've had though I would probably call it more of a sandwich since it was not a burger bun. You also get free soda refills which is awesome. \n\nSince it was my Birthday-- and they knew this because we were all wearing ridiculously awesome Carnaval masks at the table and they asked us the occasion-- they brought out a Birthday desert which was basically whipped cream and a cookie of sorts with a candle. \n\nI should say that serve wasn't always on point, we had to ask a couple of times for refills, and for a place setting.

I asked her about the crust and she accurately let me know it was a pie crust not puff pastry. Thank goodness! Just what I was hoping for!\n\nThe chicken pot pie was good to great. I'm not a big meat fan in pot pie and it had very little chicken in it. Some others might be disappointed by that, but there was enough chicken to have some in every few bites. The chicken it's self was sometime a bit tender and mostly a little bit tough. But the veggies were quite tender and the sauce had a fantastic flavor. Mild hint of white wine, not overpowering. The peas tasted especially fresh and green so I appreciated that a lot. Potatoes soft and well done, not firm and dreadful like 70% of pot pies have. The pie crust was good for a restaurant. Flaky, tender and firm at the same time. Decent flavor on its own. Not excessively buttery or dry.\n\nIm glad I came back because I tried this place a couple days ago and the food wasn't as good so I was nervous.

Intrigued by the spurs, and wondering if they would kick my night in the right direction, I decided to order one.  I was a little disappointed, as It tasted like sweetened Nestea with a splash of vodka and lemon.  I sent it back, and ordered a more appropriate vodka martini with 3 giant olives.  Excellent.  I also ordered the seared tuna which was excellent.  I don't really recall how much everything was, but I do remember the sun was up when we left later that \"night\"."

For months I'd been hooked on searching for deep fried, finger-lickin'-good fish and chips. Grand Lux's version piqued my interest and I gave it a go. Four long pieces of fish (unsure what kind) battered and fried the tempura style way, these were accompanied with peanut coleslaw, french fries (chips!), and tartar sauce.  The coleslaw was acceptable and thankfully not swimming in dressing. I pushed aside the tartar sauce and devoured my fish and chips by shaking on some vinegar with multiple squirts of lemon juice that I actually had to request -- a full meal of fish and chips isn't complete without lemon! The fish and chips were palatable, but it isn't something I'd order on my next visit. \n\nSERVICE\nI used to come here often so I know that service can be hit or miss, but I've never had to endure slow and inattentive service before from its waitstaff.  During my last few visits I experienced slow-paced service around the early dinnertime hours. There weren't many diners when I visited, so I didn't see an excuse for why the waiters showed up 5-10 minutes after I'd been seated. On both visits I didn't receive my complimentary basket of bread until minutes before my entree arrived.....really, now? Also, on both occasions waiters were nowhere to be found whenever I needed a refill on my water. It wasn't until I was finished with my meal when they showed up and asked if I wanted more water.\n\nOVERALL\nI've been taking a break from Grand Lux. Hopefully, by the time I make my next visit, the service won't be mediocre as the last two times I visited. Until then, I guess if I have a craving for Grand Lux I'll have to visit The Venetian location, and I can say that I've never had an unpleasant experience with their food and service."

I get the same thing every time I go.  We just went recently with a group of friends and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I'll be sure to try another dish on our next visit.  I'm sure there are other great dishes here. \n\nI ordered their double chocolate cake for dessert and it was just eh, nothing special.  I'd pass on this next time.  It's nothing compared to Cheesecake Factory's Linda's Fudge Cake.\n\nIt helped that we had a very nice waiter named Marcus.  He was super attentive, that's always a plus!  Til next time, Grand Lux!"

The menu and offerings are slightly different, although you can still get the same cheesecake for dessert.  We shared a lunch combination of a rustic barbeque chicken pizza and green salad, ahi tuna ceviche, and the recommended chicken pot pie.  The ceviche came in generous portions and was served with crunchy strips, greens, and chips.  I would have liked it to be less salty, though.  The pizza was delicious and served on a large crisped flat crust.  We also enjoyed the chicken pot pie, with its rich and creamy sauce, tender chicken pieces, cooked vegetables, and buttery thick crust.  Be prepared to share dishes as everything comes in large servings.  With a huge menu, plenty of seating, and friendly service, this is a great spot to dine at anytime of day."

I do prefer the Cheesecake Factory, but  my opinion is bias because I know one of the managers in Denver, and he always pays a lot of my tab when I eat there. \n\nI've been here for late lunch, dinner and breakfast. I have yet to have a bad experience. There is a great variety on the menu for everything. I loved the breakfast because they have a breakfast bar where you can get fresh omelets or any other kind of eggs made to order. My husband had fried chicken and waffles ( which I still gag thinking of ). Yes I tried it, but I just can't do it. We've shared chicken enchiladas, the taquitos and the mimosas are very yummy. If you're in the Venetian, and you need variety, go here."

I haven't been to the cheesecake factory but this place is pretty good. \n\nAhi tuna salad - was just okay. It was wrapped in seaweed, and the tuna was seared just right. However, the accompanying sauce wasn't memorable. The greens were plain greens. I expect some color and flavor but it was rather plain. \n\nShort rib sloppy joe - delicious!! The only problem with this dish is that a clogged artery or a massive heart attack may occur. The meat was really tasty but really salty. It's served with butter bread. It's basically bread saturated in butter. Very bad for you but oh so delicious. \n\nSpicy buffalo chicken flatbread - very delicious but isn't spicy. This is a great dish because it's healthy and very filling. \n\nBurger - their burger really hit the spot for me. I love burgers and was definitely satisfies with my angus burger with added sauteed mushrooms. Excellent!!\n\nIn general, this is a great place to go to when you want to watch your wallet and still leave full. It can get a little pricey but a tab foe four people today at lunch came to only $51. That's exceptional for being in Vegas. \n\nIs definitely come back. \n\nP.S.

Wait time at 10am was around 20-30mins for a party of 5.  Those that had 2-3 people were seated right away.  The restaurant was packed.  Their breakfast buffet was simple but seems to be a decent value at $18 ($9 for kids).  Came with Egg, bacon, hash browns, sausage in chaffing bowls.  There was a pretty decent fruit selection and pastries.  The omelette station was pretty crowded.  Wait time for an omelette was around 15mins.  The belgium waffles kept running out.  They had two stations for the omelettes (manned by 2 chefs)  but the chefs also had to make and stock the waffle stations.  Too crazy!  The fruits and pastries kept running out.  They also were running out of plates and were bringing piping hot plates (still soaked in hot water) to refill.  If you are in a hurry, go for the buffet.\nWe ordered off the menu and it took a really long time to get our order.  I ordered the corn beef hash.  It was ok.  My wife got the chillaquilles (sp?) and that had a really nice flavor.  Only complaint was that it was hard to eat.  They used both chips and tortilla strips.\nService:  Was pretty slow but I felt that the server was overwhelmed by the amount of people.  She was really polite and nice.  Just slow.  \nValue:  I think for vegas, things were priced pretty well.  My corn beef hash was $13 and a decent amount.\n\nIf you need a simple meal, this is the place to go."

It's not a fancy restaurant, but for what you pay, it feels like you're going to a pretty nice looking restaurant.  Ambience is pretty relaxed and can be great for couples and a small family gathering.  The tables, linen, and dishes were all clean as well.\n\nService:\nFor the several times I've been here, the service has been pretty good.  The servers have generally been pretty quick and checked in from time to time.  It does, however, feel as if they are slightly understaffed.  A few times, we needed service but couldn't find our server for over 5 minutes.  During my last visit, we had a party of 8 and our server handled our order fairly expeditiously.  She was very friendly as well.  The wait for a party of 8 was about 15 minutes, while the smaller parties (2-5) got their tables immediately (just an FYI).\n\nFood Quality / Selection:\nHuge variety of food from pastas to sandwiches.  Take a look at their menu here: http://www.grandluxcafe.com/menu.htm.  The presentation is above average.  The look and feel of the plates is similar to most other full service restaurants (especially the chain ones).  The food is above average for the most part (see details below).\n\nPricing/Value/Convenience:\nGreat value; above-average portions.  This place is a great place to share an entr\u00e9e, an appetizer, and a dessert if you want.\n\nDishes that we ordered:\nBuffalo chicken rolls (eh, wouldn't recommend it; it has a little spicyness to it though); BBQ chicken pizza (this thin crust pizza was pretty flavorful); Pasta with chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and mushrooms (not bad, but not great); Pasta Carbonara (flavor was good, but it just wasn't creamy enough and felt a little bit dry); Artichoke dip (was a little bit dried/overcooked - a part of it was actually burnt; wasn't creamy enough also)."

As a Las Vegas local we don't venture out on the \"Strip\" often...but I have been to the Venetian location of the Grand Lux (same 'property') and have always been very pleased. Good food and decent portion sizes. This time we opted for the Palazzo location and I was very disappointed. Ordered \"Grand Lux Burger MELT\" -- \"...LOTS of cheddar cheese...\"  The 'melt' arrived and I was very surprised at how smallish it was (comparing to the Lux's usual larger portions). The fries were warm not hot -- and tasted as if they'd been sitting under a heating lamp much too long. Was tired and famished after the show so just picked at the fries and bit into the sandwich. Didn't feel an urge to say anything about the fries. Ate the first half and was not impressed with taste. Something seemed off. Boring. Not their usual quality. Took a closer look at what was left of the 'melt'. There was absolutely no visible cheese at all. Just an orange-y sauce. I showed my wife. \"Do you see any cheese?\". I called for the waiter and showed him. He seemed baffled. Almost like something fishy was going on. He actually asked \"what happened to it?\" I felt he was implying I somehow removed the cheese and maybe added it to the first half. I very clearly let him know that the menu describe this \"melt\" as having \"Lots of cheddar cheese\". He took the plate back to the kitchen and eventually returned with it and said that the kitchen told him that the cheese was right there -- pointing to the mystery sauce. I ran my finger through the 'sauce' and said -- \"...this is like mayonnaise -- there is no cheese at all. Am I not seeing something?\" He seemed baffled and a little embarrassed. I asked for the manager who came over and listened to me and didn't really respond. I asked him point blank -- \"Is there cheese on here I'm not seeing?\". He just kept nodding his head not committing. I pointed out that the menu declared \"LOTS of cheddar cheese\" so there should be at least some evidence of the product! He offered us a dessert 'on the house'. I declined and said we were finished. I also asked him if my 'melt' would be taken off the check. It was but that did not alleviate the complete comical serving of a meal that would have easily been bested by Jack-In-The-Box and one of their 'patty-melts'. \n\nWhat I think was happening is they had a lazy/inept chef late in the evening on a Friday night (the food took unusually long coming out and at this time of night the place wasn't as busy as it can be) and was being stubborn with the waiter. I'm sure I'll try the Lux again based on my satisfying past experiences but it will likely be at the Venetian location instead of the Palazzo."

And if you save it for later to eat, it just gets even better because the pasta absorbs all the sauce lol.  I really like it a lot. Love their bread pudding as well, it's a must! Very dreamy!"

They're also open 24 hours which is very convenient for late night munchies.  Overall the food was very good and reminiscent of the cheesecake factory (Company/Owners).  But I personally think the Grand Lux is much better than the Cheesecake factory.\n\nWe tried most of the pastas, some sandwiches and the asian specialties over rice.  Here are my favorites:\n\n**Pasta Telephono- Creamy tomato sauce baked with melted mozzarella and breadcrumbs... delicious!\n\n**Crispy Caramel Chicken- Sweet, crispy and tangy little pieces of fried chicken over rice... sorta like orange chicken but much much better.  *The Shaking Beef is also very good and has a similar flavor.\n\n**Seared Ahi Tuna salad- very light and refreshing with a good amount of fish.\n\n**Spinach dip- Creamy with lots of spinach and artichoke and not too heavy like other spinach dips\n\n**Short-rib grilled cheese-  tender short rib with different melted cheeses and caramelized onions.  Very filling...\n\nMy least favorite meal was the ZEN NOODLES- overpriced with mediocre broth.  I thought it would be just like Pho Ga(chicken) but it was way too lemony and the rice noodles were thick and too hard.  You get a small bowl for $14 and they do not have any hoisin sauce :(  If you really want pho I would drive off the strip to chinatown or down flamingo road..."

I came here soon after the Yelp Helps event came to an end. The decor is impressive and compliments the Palazzo Hotel theme quite nicely. There is a TV by the bar, an awesome display of wine collections, and decorations here and there to tease the eye. Don't let the name Cafe fool you! This is a clean, upscale venue.\n\nWe were seated and received fabulous service from our waiter. He recommended the pasta plate and we went with it, ordering just one plate. The portions are more than generous! For under $20, the pasta fed my partner and I more than enough. Aside from pasta, I know they also have a wide array of salads and burgers, which I will definitely try in the future.\n\nThe bartender really knows his stuff. I never knew Tokyo Tea or mixed drinks from the bar can taste so good. I'm beginning to understand why some of my friends hate the idea of ordering drinks at nightclubs. Nightclub \"bartenders\" just does not compare. Now I'm making it a routine for me to pick up a drink at a bar before hitting the clubs.\n\nThe total tab came out to be about $30 with tip. I will definitely be coming to this venue again in the future."

But while the prices were great, the food was just OK.\n\nDraft beers were $4 (regularly $7), and there were a myriad of appetizers for $5.50 each. Because the normal app prices are in the $9-$11 range, I thought these would be smaller portions. Nope. They were HUGE! I ordered the Asian nachos (my friend's favorite), and my husband ordered the potato spring rolls. Both items were visually appealing but sadly lacked flavor. The nachos had a tasty peanut sauce, but the fried wontons tasted a little like Styrofoam and there wasn't much chicken to speak of. And while the spring rolls were topped with cheese and crispy bacon, the mashed potato filling was pretty bland. I'll give them points for creativity, and I can't complain much at $5.50 a pop, but I wouldn't pay full price for either item.\n\nGrand Lux has a pretty extensive full menu, so if you choose to eat in the restaurant (happy hour is at the bar only), you might have better luck. But if you're on this part of the Strip and you're looking for a great happy hour, walk a few blocks down to The Yard House at The Linq. Beer is a little more expensive, but the food is better and the view is killer!"

Unfortunately, they did not make it clear if it was the Bistro or the Bakery, so we tried to check out both. I'm not familiar with the Venetian, so thinking that their own workers know where thing are located we asked several people. Out of 4 people that we asked only 1 gave us correct directions. We zigged zagged the hotel until we found the elevator to the Bistro.\n\nI wanted a light breakfast, but the prices at the Bouchon Bistro were a bit steep for such a meal. Then we went to check out the Bouchon Bakery, which offered pastries which was not quite what my tummy wanted. Then when all hope was lost and I was ready to give up and just eat at the food court the glowing red lights of the Grand Lux Cafe drew us in.\n\nWe just missed the breakfast menu so lunch was it. I ordered the Lunch Soup and Salad, which consisted of my choice of Cream of Chicken Soup and a house salad. The soup was creamy with large pieces of chicken, peas, carrots and more. We also got the Chicken Pot Pit, which looked a lot like my Cream of Chicken soup with a crust that was laid on top. The difference with the pot pie and the soup was that it appears as if they grilled the large pieces of chicken found in the pie."

This was the perfect hangover food to have in Vegas. I also tip off my hat to our waitress, who was dealing with a still drunk buddy of mine and had to fight off my friend's marriage proposals. She was a champ and played with him, which made for an entertaining meal for the table.

So once we found the right one, we ordered from their tapas page at the front of the menu, basically a variety of small plates. We tried almost everything: calamari, ahi tuna ceviche, and the short rib asian tacos, macaroni and cheese, buffalo chicken bites, mini pastrami reuben sandwiches.  And of course for dessert the lava cake. Our favorites were the ceviche and short rib tacos. The calamari and pastrami dishes were very good too. The macaroni and cheese was not good at all. In the menu it's described as creamy, but the cheese on top was rock hard. When I decided to take it home for the kids, I found all the creaminess had separated and was at the bottom of the little skillet that it's served in. Best thing about the little plates are the reasonable prices and you still have room for dessert. And you MUST save room for dessert. The lava cake here was to die for, and dare I say it, the best lava cake I've ever had! The presentation was beautiful, on a rectangular platter, the cake, scoop of vanilla ice cream, garnish of strawberries all in a row, with a sweep of chocolate ganash along the top. They have a selection of baked to order desserts, including this one, that you have to order at least 30 minutes in advance. It had a perfectly chewy, brownie like consistency on the outside and once you poked a hole in it, the piping hot ganache comes flowing out like.... lava. So perfect!\n\nAlso, they had a great service. Our server in particular was amazing. We noticed that he didn't write anything down when we ordered and we asked him about it later. He said that he's taken orders for parties of 12 and remembers everything. \n\nSo if you don't know what to eat while in Vegas, come here because they have everything and they do it really well."

We wanted to have a meal but not have the meal overshadow what we were going to have for dinner, so we opted for classic comfort food without going to a fancy schmancy place that offered a lunch menu or a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef, which is a lot of restaurants around the Venetian/Palazzo area.\n\nI had a feeling that the wait times were going to be long come lunch hour so around 11:45 I claimed my table for two, which took around ~5 minutes. This ended up being a good decision because when the No1DP left workshops to meet me for lunch around 12:10, the line was out the restaurant.\n\nNo1DP and I sat in a table that was so small it could barely fit ourselves and our drinks, plates and silverware much less what we ordered. As there was another pair sitting to the right of the waitstaff couldn't put any extra food there (to the left was the main walkway and kitchen area) and we wondered how they were going to manage our orders once they were ready.\n\nNo1DP had a beer while I had these morning cocktails.\nStrawberry Bellini ($10.95): Fresh Strawberries, Champagne and Triple Sec. The fresh strawberries were the star of this cocktail. Strawberries were still sweet enough to eat afterwards. \nThe Grand Mimosa ($10.95): With Mumm Napa, Grand Marnier and Fresh Orange Juice. I've had better mimosas for cheaper, balance between champagne and OJ was a bit off.\n\nWe had the following dishes a la carte.\nSeared Rare Ahi Tuna Salad ($16.95): romaine, radicchio, frisee and avocado tossed in vinaigrette. We were warned about how big these salads were - when the dish came out we thought the salad could serve 3! There were plenty of greens and ahi on that plate. Vinaigrette was tart and light. Ahi was lightly salted and quite soft though a little more firm than sashimi ahi. \n\nAs we were eating our salad the plates containing the two other orders were brought forth but the waiter noticed that since we had no room on our table he promptly brought the dishes back to the kitchen. As we finished the ahi the waiter passed us by without checking up on us to see if we were finished nor asked us if we would like our other entrees next. It wasn't until we prompted him about ~15 minutes later to take away our salad plate to make room for the other dishes. \n\nNew Orleans Shrimp Saute ($14.95): shrimp, tomatoes, roasted peppers and cajun spices, all simmered in a delicious tasso sauce, served with steamed white rice and grilled bread. The best dish of the three, sauce was buttery, smokey and a bit spicy. Long grained rice suited this dish well as it absorbed the sauce, as did the thin and crunchy bread. \n\nHousemade Pierogies ($13.95): potato dumplings with slow roasted short rib, mushrooms and onion. garnished with green onion and sour cream. Both of us had pierogies before and we both agreed that this dish more resembled a gyoza than a pierogi. Pierogis can be heavy but are not supposed to be deep fried and heavy as this. As we were already stuffed by the previous dish we struggled to eat even one \"pierogi\". \n\nSupposedly they are more known for their breakfasts so I'll have to check that out one day but I'll explore other options for lunch and dinner."

I think it is owned by the same people who own The Cheesecake Factory because the decor and the vibe of the restaurant reminded me so much of that restaurant. \n\nThe atmosphere was very luxurious with marble or granite counter tops and bars...very nice.  The menu was huge with a lot of different items. They even had a late night menu because the restaurant was open 24 hours a day.\n\nThe food was so good and it wasn't overly expensive for a Las Vegas restaurant. The wait was not very long as it is a huge restaurant. The wait staff was decent and was very knowledgeable about menu items. \n\nDuring our breakfast, the waitress had suggested the banana pecan pancakes with the home made caramel syrup. I am so happy that I ordered them because it was amazing. The pancakes were fluffy and fresh. My friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes and felt sick when he was finished because they were so decadent....but he loved it! \n\nI suggest The Grand Lux Cafe for large groups or families who are looking for a delicious meal that isn't too expensive. So many options to chose from, everyone will be pleased."

I ordered some Asian nachos. \nA dish I've had before and really enjoyed. But today it was so salty it wasn't editable. \nWhen I told the manager he seemed as though he could care less. I returned the food. It looked to him like I ate quite a bit of the nachos. But I shared them with two others we all had one each. So to him it appeared as though we ate most of them. \nSo he didn't remove them from my bill. That's ok. I will never eat there again anyway. It was terrible and he was too."

            "review": "Grand Lux Cafe at the Palazzo has over 200 items on the menu, but everything tastes great and is made fresh daily. Their drinks come with mouthwatering garnishes and taste great. I have had the luxury of trying almost everything on the menu and will attempt to describe everything I have tried.\n\nNew Orleans Beignets: This is a bake-to-order dessert that is available for breakfast as well as throughout the day. The beignet is a French-style fried doughnut that is light and fluffy and comes with four sauces on the side: Jack Daniel's Creme Anglaise sauce, Raspberry sauce, Chocolate sauce, and Cinnamon Sugar. \n\nJamaican Pork Tenderloin: This dish comes out with two fried wonton chips looking like pig's ears to identify the dish and comes with the pork in the middle (chili-rubbed) over sweet mashed potatoes with white rice and black beans sitting over a black pepper sauce. The black pepper sauce is the only thing spicy in the dish, although not too spicy for my taste. Bring on the spicy!\n\nPasta Telephono: Penne with melted cheese that creates a telephone cord (who has landline phones with curly cords these days?) when you pick it up with a fork, yum!\n\nSunday Night Pasta: Short rib, chunks of beef, and ground beef go into the mix of spaghettini. Although surely inspired by leftovers, this dish doesn't taste like leftovers at all. It is truly yummy and especially when it came out piping hot! It is served all nights of the week.\n\nRoasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad: This dish has pistacchios in it but I love it for that and the goat cheese as well. The beets are seasonally different in colors, so they may come purple or yellow. It's served with a hazelnut-citrus vinaigrette.\n\nBelgian Waffle: The waffle comes sprinkled with powdered sugar and hot maple syrup on the side. It's simple and delicious, almost purist.\n\nExpress Breakfast Bar: A selection of yogurt, granola, wheat or white bread (there's a toaster for people to toast their own bread), English Muffin, or Bagels (ask for the cream cheese, it's not at the bar...boo), fresh fruit, a made-to-order omelette bar, bacon, scrambled eggs (probably made from powder), hashbrowns, and some small breakfast pastries like scones/croissants/cheese danishes/streuseled pastries. It includes juices and coffee and some other drinks, possibly milk and fountain drinks.\n\nHot Chocolate: Probably the BEST hot chocolate I have ever had in my life, with no sediments, made with whipped foam on top and some rich whipped cream and a swirl of hot chocolate, but the drink is not too sweet and not too bland. \n\nWild Mushroom Burger: Not a burger with mushrooms as I first thought, but a patty made of mushrooms and tasting so good that I almost would turn vegetarian (almost!). Sesame seeds come on the bun and there's a side of bibb lettuce, tomatoes, and onions with an avocado cream sauce, or was it basil aioli? Anyway, it was good!\n\nVietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls: eight pieces comes with Thai BBQ sauce and Peanut sauce with the chicken, slivers of carrots and lettuce throughout the summer roll (rice flour wrap) and ready to be dipped! I would ask for some hot sauce, but that's just me.\n\nIsland Cooler: non-alcoholic, made with pineapple, mango, and some other juice, tastes really yummy and comes with an edible garnish of strawberry, pineapple, and lime. \n\nWARNING: PORTIONS ARE GARGANTUAN!~ SHARE SHARE SHARE!\n\nI gave this place a five because I feel that it is a very caring place with the servers not upselling anything and being honest about portion sizes. I also think that the atmosphere is very grand but still casual and the food is of great value. You get more than what you paid for."

We've been going to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the past 5 days that we've been here.The receptionist was telling us there is a waiting time for 25 minutes which we thought is reasonable. We waited over 50 minutes to be seated but they were calling tables of 4,6, and 7 when we were waiting twice as long as them. I went to front desk asked for assistance a numerous amount of times and they kept saying 10-15 minutes. They said there is nothing they can do and we have to wait longer than normal. Let me add the fact that my sister is handicap & we needed to be seated sooner than anyone else. I asked for a supervisor, who came in about 10 minutes. We went from waiting for 25 minutes to 50 minutes to about AN HOUR AND A HALF!!! Is this a joke?! \nMarty, the so-called supervisor, was a complete BITCH. She came to us and said, \"if you don't want to wait then you can leave, go! I'm trying to put tables together and people don't want to leave.\" At the time she was telling me these things, her hostess's were seating parties of 2,4,6 and 7... How does that even make sense?? We've been waiting for an hour and a half and you're prioritizing other customers rather than seating a table of 10 who have been coming to you guys for YEARS?? The \"supervisor\" turned around to my dad & shoved her hand in his face and said, sir I'm telling you one more time,\nif you don't want to wait then leave! My dad got extremely frustrated but kept his cool and continued to be nice. Therefore: he went into the restaurant to check the open seats and there was a bunch! So he took pictures and showed the supervisor where she turned around and said \"you're telling me how to run my business?!\" Uh, you clearly don't know how to run a business when you have a bunch of open seats and are making us wait for over an hour and a half.. when she saw those pictures, she was asking my dad where those seats are.. Lol, what an amazing supervisor with such a great staff. (Complete sarcasm) At the end of all of this, Marty shoved her hand in my dads face, did the bitch walk and completely ignored my dad when he was speaking to her. Oh and we ended up leaving because they still made us wait :). NEVER will we ever go to the Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo. They're customer service SUCKS! Goodbye to Marty & the staff!"

There are a few zones to this huge restaurant, a \"terrace\" that is on the casino floor, a bar area, a main dining room with buffet. Mostly booths for seating options.\n\nFor breakfast I wanted something light...so naturally I ordered biscuits and gravy. The portion was massive with two biscuits, two eggs, breakfast potatoes and lots of sausage gravy. The biscuits were a little dry, but the gravy was good. Fresh squeezed OJ and decent coffee. Mom got a traditional egg/bacon breakfast that she thought was decent. Similarly huge portion.\n\nLunch was equally decent. We both had sandwiches. I had a tasty Reuben. With some crispy yummy fries. Don't know if it was that I really needed to eat but that combo hit the spot. Again, massive portion sizes. \n\nIt's not a restaurant that I'd seek out, but it's definitely a more quality option than most of the strip's standard buffet or cafe offerings."

I could literally taste the batter and immediately sent it back. \n\nEntr\u00e9es: I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken \"Burrito\" which was the epitome of lackluster and bland. And to top it off, the only side pairings for this dish was the choice of a house side salad or fries; not complimenting at all for an Asian-inspired dish.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken which turned out to be BUTTER fried chicken topped with mashed potatoes. He immediately ran to the bathroom to regurgitate just a few bites of it because of the ridiculously high butter content of this dish. \n\nTo make matters worse, the manager never even made it a point to visit the table to offer an apology or even \"check in\" with us are having sent TWO items away. \n\nDefinitely our biggest let-down of a dining experience in our 6 days here....

After paying the remainder of our bill, I asked to see the room where our reception would be help, and the manager took us THROUGH the kitchen to reach the room.

They were indulgent and in line with what a trip to Vegas represents. The flavor of the chorizo still makes my mouth water thinking about  it. \n\nLunch on the other hand was a little less spectacular and hence why I knocked off a star. The indochine chicken and shrimp was a less spicy than expected after eating in both India and China. However, loved the fact that the shrimp was completely cleaned (didn't have a tail to pull off). The house salad and pasta telephono combo was a mixed bag. House salad top notch. The pasta, was a little more ordinary. \n\nSo go for breakfast and explore other places for lunch or dinner was my take away from the place. Nothing against their lunch but the breakfast set the standards pretty high."

Asian nachos yes, Mexican nachos no. Baffling. Seriously, I don't get it. The person who created the menu was like... hey, let's put everything in the world you can think of on this bar food menu except for NACHOS! That will be a great trick, we'll show those fatass Americans!\n\nBut enough about the asshole who thought it was a good idea to make nachos with an Asian flair, because it wasn't, and that guy is just a douchecanoe.\n\nThe only thing I get here is the flatbread chicken sandwich with no cheese. I had it the first time I went and there were no major post-dinner disasters. I'm afraid that if I eat anything else, the disaster in my bathroom will make the BP oil spill seem like a leaky faucet. \n\nBig plus for Sam Adams on draft, but not because that's rare, only because it's my favorite. 3 stars for being completely normal, the menu has enough options to please every single person that walks through the restaurant door."

Now I've never actually been to a Cheesecake Factory, but perhaps I should try one sometime. This certainly isn't the most obvious choice for dining with all the world class Vegas restaurants nearby. But for me, after 12-15 hour days on my feet running around the event floor, this is my go to dinner spot. It's located not far from the guest room elevators (less walking!) they have a nice bar it's easy to tuck into a corner and enjoy a drink, and they have an excellent take out menu so I can hobble back upstairs and relax in my suite. \n\nMy favorite items here are the chicken lettuce wraps, and the beet and goat cheese salad. The menu is overwhelming in options-pizzas, pastas, burgers, breakfast, and can't forget the dessert. While I wish my job hours and energy level allowed me to venture out for some of those famous Vegas restaurants, I am always happy to get fast service, reliable food, and retreat to my room to enjoy."

The waitstaff were very available to hand out beer, wine and water, and were friendly for the most part. We had a buffet instead of a prix fixe menu, and the food was decent, although not amazing. The meat carving station was the only part that really stood out to me- it was fantastic. The salad was also above average in tastiness. \n\nThis rating is completely based off of my experience as a part of a very large group here; I have not visited and ordered on my own. I do know this place is owned by the same company as the Cheesecake Factory, and the menu is very similar. In general I'm a cheesecake factory fan, although I think the menu is too large. \n\nI might change my rating if I pay this place a visit on my own, but for now I'm going to go with A-OK as my experience here."

Cant mess that up. \n\nWe noticed that some people were going to a buffet inside the restaurant. We overheard when they sat the table next to us that they had that. The lady never mentioned that to us however. I think they need to be better about that. Also , the front hostess wasn't the friendliest. She barely looked at us and seemed like she hated her job. Thats not so great for the first person you encounter when you walk into the place. Middle aged lady with her hair tied back. Didn't get her name, but she was working lunch this past Saturday. \n\nOther than that, this place is good. Fast to sit, a whole variety to decide from and easy for lunch."

The only reason why I could give 4 or 5 stars was the fact that I noticed something lumpy in my salad dressing. Didn't request bleu cheese dressing so i knew it wasnt a clump of cheese. So I took it out and couldn't decipher what it was. It was brown and soft and about the size of a walnut. The first image that popped in my head was it looked like a waterbug (very gross). Instantly I lost my appetite. I called my server and brought it to his attention. He took the dressing. The manager came by and was very apologetic. He said it was a heirloom tomato. I was relieved to know that it was something edible (well a waterbug may be a delicatessen in another country) in the dressing. However, I wasn't hungry at that point, so I got it boxed to go. The bill came and noticed the manager took the salad off of the bill.\n\nOther than the \"surprise\" in my salad dressing, I still enjoyed the food and the service."

I also prefer this location over the Venetian location because the desserts are different! If you ask me, the palazzo one is the better of the two. The food is good! Relatively close to the Cheesecake Factory (& they have the same owner) and a little bit more upscale. Also, the DESSERTS! My all time favorite dessert is at the grand lux cafe! It's the molten lava cake! Now, I've tried molten lava cakes nearly everywhere and nowhere does it as good as the grand lux cafe. It's the most richest, chocolate-iest, most delicious dessert! It has soft and gooey but has a bit of a chewy crunch to the outside. They also are very generous with the fudge! It literally will lava it's way out once you take the first bite! And to top it off, served a la mode! I wish they would bring back the Los Angeles location!"

The chicken was very moist and seasoned very well (may be a bit salty for some of you). The corn is really fresh (none of that canned stuff!) and may have been my favorite part of the meal. Not bad at all :)\n\nOverall they give giant portions for a good price. I think the food (the breakfast) may have been better, but then again we did go fairly late to eat. I'd come back; this is a very convenient place."

Our server was very friendly and attentive.  When she gave us our menus, I almost passed out- holy cats!  There were almost as many items on the menu as The Cheesecake Factory- no joke!!!! I'm thinking to myself- how can this little restaurant possibly do all of these items right?  I mean, there were so many, and they were so varied!  Salads, pasta dishes, soups, seafood, meats, vegetarian and vegan dishes....the list was overwhelming!\n\nMy hubs ordered a salmon dish, and since I'm not a seafood lover, and I had a not so fun night the night before, (food poisoning), so I needed to keep it safe food-wise...I ordered the carbonara  without any chicken.  \n\nWe didn't wait too long, and we were having a good time listening to the two young dudes next to us trying to pick up these two beautiful women that were way out of their league- seriously, Vegas is so much fun to people watch! :) \n\nMy husband said his salmon dish was beyond amazing.  He tried to get me to try a bite, but I wasn't having that- no matter how great he said it was.  I could tell by the look on his face he was in salmon heaven.  \n\nMy carbonara was ridiculous!!!!! It was THE BEST I've ever had!!!!!! The pasta was so perfect and it tasted like it was maybe cooked with garlic and cream.  The sauce was not too buttery, but just right.  Savory. Creamy. Perfect! I love bacon, but usually not chunks...but this bacon was chunky and so tasty!  No chewy fatty pieces either- just crazy flavor! :). The peas were nice as well. \n\nI was only sad because I couldn't eat all of it, and I don't have a refrigerator in my room....so sadly I had to leave the rest.  \n\nOverall, the server was awesome and the salmon dish and carbonara was amazing.  This is a must stop.  Don't be fooled by the lack of fanciness...It will very pleasantly surprise you!"

We waited quite a while to get waters and the menu. But after our order was taken, everything was smooth sailing from there. Our waiter checked up on us quite often and didn't take long when we requested for things. \n\nI ordered the clam chowder. It was really good. I didn't have to add salt or pepper or crackers either. It was so creamy and thick, and perfect for a hang over. Well, it worked for me ;p \n\nThe second dish I ordered was the Kobe meatballs. Comes with two. They were HUGE! As it being Kobe beef, my expectations were high. But, the meatballs did fall short. They were good, but could've been better. The meat could have used more seasoning. The marinara sauce that came with it was ok (kind of tasted like spaghetti sauce from a jar) and the cheese melted on top of the meatballs lacked taste. The portion was quite large, though. It's perfect for sharing!"

We must say we were extremely happy with the food, as were as our guests ( and we have some picky eaters!) We had a four course menu and everything was hot, fresh, and great tasting! We loved the double stuffed potato spring rolls & fried calamari & rock shrimp. The wedge salad was great and so flavorful. Many of our guests ordered the filet mignon and all were very satisfied. Since Grand Lux is affiliated with the Cheesecake Factory, we choose their fresh strawberry cheesecake for dessert, giant piece, not too sweet, and very tasty. We were extremely happy with our food and our experience at the Grand Lux Palazzo. Portions were huge and affordable for the size. You will leave beyond full, with food to take home!"

I don't like chicken much, definitely not lettuce, but man.\n\nReasons to jump on the Grand Lux bandwagon:\n\n-chicken lettuce wraps\n-never a wait\n-they make me grilled cheese's when I'm drunk even though it's not on the menu\n-the one actual restaurant on the strip with good food that doesn't cost a paycheck\n-unlimited bread\n- short rib grilled cheese sandwich\n\nConfession #2: One tme, when I was so hungover (still drunk) and alone in my room at the Palazzo I called down for takeout and ordered for myself fried calamari, salad, 1/2 sandwich and soup combo, and chicken lettuce wraps, all for less than $30. If there's a cure for the morning-after depression it's laying out a helluva lot of food on my hotel bed and lying down and resting whatever I'm eating on my tummy while I watch tv. BOOM.

You can get the lunch portion which comes with a side salad ($12.95), but they only serve this until 5pm. The dinner portion costs $16.95. Kinda pricey for a pasta that doesn't even come with any meat. Adding chicken will cost you an additional $2, and they actually charge you per shrimp if you want to add that! I've never heard of a restaurant doing that before!\n\nAnyways, I can't really comment much on their other dishes. I've tried a few others before and didn't have any complaints.

The grilled chicken avocado salad is fresh and delicious, the portion serves 2 people (one if you're ravenous and will fill you to the brim!) for $14.  The Manhattan salad with the option of vegetables and cheese (other options include, chicken, shrimp, and price varies accordingly) rang in about $14.  They don't skimp on the cheese or beans or dressing either!  I eat a lot and the salads were filling!  Complimentary sourdough and butter came with the salads.  I think I got about 3 to 4 large slices of sourdough per salad.  How generous is that for a $14 meal?  Dinner for 2 cost under $35!  Much cheaper and fresher than other expensive places in Vegas.

Since we were undecided,  we simply hit their buffet @ $ 16.50 pp.      Though selection isn't  as huge as other buffet spreads, the food was good,  as was their juice & coffee.   Service was good.     Tip:  If you're staying at the Venetian or Palazzo and there;s a long line,   simply pull go to the Gracie Line,  which will get you in much quicker.    The Gracie Card is the gambling rewards card issued by Venetian & Palazzo."

I make it a point to stop by whenever I come out to Sin City.  In fact, we ate here two nights in a row during the last trip.  Just doesn't get old!  So convenient after a night out if you're staying at the Venetian.  The location is RIGHT next to the guest room elevators.  You can't just pass by Grand Lux and not eat on the way back to your room.  That's preposterous!  \n\nCome here to satisfy your drunken munchies, soak up that alcohol with their complimentary bread n buttah, or even order a few more drinks.  I don't know about you guys, but I need something crunchy and guilt-ridden when I got the drunk munchies.  The crispy flautas from the appetizer menu is a blessing from above.  Just check out my picture (http://media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uoo08O3ZAgdWMET_-M-cHg/l).  With the avocado sauce it comes with, this lil snack can be enjoyed intoxicated or not.  SO good.  If it doesn't tickle your fancy..there's still so much to choose from the late hour menu.  It's not as extensive as the daytime menu but you still got your breakfast plates, sandwiches, salad, pasta, etc.\n\nDuring normal hours, I absolutely MUST have my spicy flat bread chicken sandwich.  Grilled chicken, pepperjack, and all the usual fixings on a pita-like bread split into 4 quarters.  Its corn salsa is the perfect topping.  They lay on a little bit of the chipotle mayo sauce, but I always ask for more for the side of fries it comes with.  You guys really gotta order this at least once.  It's a pretty large amount of food -- I always gotta half it with someone.\n\nService is always great & I've never had to wait over 5 minutes for a table, but I may have been lucky each and every time.  Wish I had the same kind of luck at the adjacent slots and black jack tables. Hmph.."

I ordered the chicken and waffle, which I was somewhat hesistant about at first since I read on Yelp it's not actual chicken wings, but chicken tenders. Luckily my food was great! The waffle was just how I love it, thick, crispy and sweet - as a bonus the waffle was topped with pecans and powdered sugar. The chicken was crispy and delicious, although it could have had a tad more seasoning. My sister got the pulled pork sandwich which she liked; it tasted very similar to the pulled pork sandwich at Cheesecake. Overall the food was great and I will go back on my next trip to Las Vegas."

He said I could substitute the fruit for hash browns, but not for the toast. So I passed on the toast, but did order the hash browns. It took longer than I expected for eggs (it was about 30 minutes) and he came back to my table just before my food came out and said \"I'm so sorry for the delay in your food, but I wanted to talk to the chef before putting in your order to make sure the hash browns were ok for you ... just to make sure we didn't put bread or anything in them, because I know they're not just plain potatoes.\"\n\nI was SO impressed that he made that effort!\n\nWhile I was waiting for my food, I was watching the efficient wait staff bus and reset tables. As the man was resetting the table next to me for the next guest, he was putting out the side/bread plates and I noticed a piece of paper on one of the plates (like a receipt or washing instructions from a new box of china). I wondered if he would notice and as soon as he finished - he took one last look at the table, saw the paper, looked at it as if to say \"what is that?\" and not only removed the paper but also replaced the plate with a clean plate.\n\nWhat attention to detail!

I tend to stray away from the Kobe Burgers because usually places just put the Kobe name on it and make a mediocre burger leaving me disappointed! That wasn't the case here... The burger was moist and really flavorful with caramelized onions, sauteed shitakke mushrooms and togarashi aoili! \n\nI really think you can't go wrong here, grab something that sounds good and I am sure you will be more than satisfied ESPECIALLY if you are here in the middle of the night!\n\nMY GO-TO DISH: Quality food at any time of day or night? They're all GO-TO DISHES ;)"

Saw this place had good Yelp reviews so we checked it out.\n\nI had the ahi salad, and it was delicious. A good amount of ahi, and avocado, and a yummy dressing. Also had a pear martini which was decent - not great,  but fine. (The waiter told me their drinks were strong. I didn't agree but also admit my perception is somewhat skewed!) My colleagues had a pulled pork sandwich and fish and chips, and both were happy about their selections. One said the coleslaw was some of the best he'd ever had.\n\nVERY nice service (including giving three people four checks so that we could each expense our food separately, and me leave the martini off the expense report!) and good food.\n\nPrices were also quite reasonable for Vegas and the Venetian, and pretty comparable to if you were at the Cheesecake Factory."

This appetizer is enough for 6 people, no joke.... Spinach Artichoke Dip (tasty), Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls( ok), Duck Potstickers(tasty), Buffalo Chicken Rolls(not so tasty), Cheese Steak Spring Rolls (not so tasty) and Vietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls(the chicken was super dry and this is the 2nd time we've tried them).\n\nWe then shared the Mongolian Beef which was really good, served with pita bread and rice. Why 2 starches? Beats the heck out of me.\n\nThen the staff was so nice to let us go see Jersey Boys and come back after the show to enjoy the Strawberry Shortcake. I love strawberries, i really do. But there was nothing special about the shortcake. Just typical, but still good.\n\nMy roomate will sometimes bring home other deserts which are WAY better. So way better they get to the point of craving status...Warm Banana Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding is my all time favorite and the Roasted Pineapple Upside Down Cake is also very very good and they are all big enough to share. \n\nOn one of my visits I got the chicken, thinking it was like Fried Chicken (like a leg and a thigh), but it wasn't. It was under seasoned chicken strips. The batter is missing something chef. Please handle that.\n\nOverall i would go there again even if my roomie didn't work there....."

Its a tiny bit of beef and a crapload of sliced green onions. Oh, and for the appetizers, try the chicken lettuce wraps. Very good, but they make it look like the dish is full of chicken...its not. Its mostly those white fried crispy noodles. But for dessert, ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS, save room for the Beignets. Holy smokin frijoles they are awesome.

We ordered some ahi tuna to start.\n\nThe tuna was ok, nothing spectacular or anything. It was served with carrots, bean sprouts, and cucumbers. There was no soy sauce or wasabi served with the dish. Instead, the plate had a line of what appeared to be some kind of creamy horseradish.\n\nI ordered a BLT and it was tasty. Nothing really to write home about, but then again it's a BLT, kind of hard to screw up.\n\nOur server was very friendly and attentive considering the time of day. I would probably pass if I had to eat here again, but if you want a bite to eat during odd hours, it's one of the few places open where you can sit down and have a bite."

It's definitely like a Cheesecake Factory, from the large variety of menu items to the decor. Our server was really friendly.\n\nI got the Garlic Shrimp Pasta and my boyfriend got the Carolina BBQ Sandwich. Garlic Shrimp Pasta was close to $20 but so worth it. It's saucy once you stir it all together and the shrimp was good and completely peeled. It looks like the sauce would be light but it actually tastes pretty heavy/creamy so I didn't eat a whole lot. I took like 2/3 of it as leftovers. My boyfriend really enjoyed his sandwich. It came with extra cole slaw on the side which he liked and the french fries were good; slightly crispy. He also took half his sandwich home too. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed the meal here and would come back if we're feeling different types of food since the variety is great here. It's casual, has lots of seating, and gets you full!"

            "review": "Basically a smaller version of Cheesecake Factory (well they ARE owned by them hahaha..), but for some reason a whole lot better! \n\nI've been to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times, and I felt that it was relatively over-priced for the measley portions they offer. However, Grand Lux shares just about the same menu, but pricing and portions are worth the cost.\n\nWhile my friends and I were staying at the Venetian, Grand Lux Cafe was basically our go-to spot for food, regardless of time or circumstance, since of course it's open 24 hours. Incredibly convenient, especially for a city like Vegas!\n\nI tried a couple different things I don't often order at restaurants, the Braised Yankee Pot Roast and the Veal Saltimbocca. \n\nNow, you can get pot roast just about ANYWHERE, but Grand Lux prepared it so well. Normally, at your run-of-the-mill restaurants, the Pot Roast description says \"slow-roasted until tender\" and ends up being all dry and chewy. Grand Lux's version was a different story; I could've sworn the meat was as tender as butter and as savory as can possibly be. The vegetables were fresh and buttery, though I wasn't too fond of the yams. (Not a yam guy, so sue me.)\n\nThe Veal Saltimbocca was pretty much like a Chicken Cordon Bleu, but with a nice twist. The veal was done just right and the prosciutto and Fontina cheese complimented it well. Throw in a well-balanced mixture of Parmesan breadcrumbs and herbs and you've got a classic mainstay dish on your hands. The angel-hair pasta with wine sauce grounded out the dish very well, though I personally thought it was a little too oily.\n\nI believe Grand Lux is one of those restaurants you just have to stop by if you're ever in Vegas, especially since it's open 24 hours. So whether you need some food to sober up after partying a little too hard at Tao, or would like a nice breakfast to talk over plans of the day with friends, I highly recommend Grand Lux Cafe!\n\n-- Quan"

I got the chicken and waffles and it was tasty, but I wouldn't order it again. The chicken was crispy and seasoned well, but the waffle could use some improvement. I understand that waffles can be oily from all the butter and oil, but I found my waffle too oily. There was also powdered sugar on top of the waffle which I didn't particularly like since I ended up pouring maple syrup over the waffle, so the extra powdered sugar was unnecessary. There could also be more chicken. Overall, I would recommend this place, but not their chicken and waffles. It's not bad, but there are better chicken and waffles out there."

The menu was so vast that there is something for everyone. I ended up coming here for three meals during my week long stay in Vegas. \n\nI had a Grand Lux Omlette for breakfast, which came with asparagus, Artichoke, Oven-Dried Tomato, Portabella Mushrooms and Havarti Cheese. I asked for the hollondaise sauce on the side.  Also came with choice of hashbrowns or tomatoe/lettuce and choice of bread. I went for the tomatoe/lettuce and an english muffin.  It tasted perfect!  If you like cream cheese, ask for some because they make it fresh and boy it is gooooood!\n\nAs for the other two meals, I had the the Manhattan salad for dinner. The portion was huge, I had to take half of it to go.  It was a chopped salad with Romaine Lettuce, Asparagus, Tomato, White Beans, Fresh Beets, Red Onion, Peas, Lentils and Assorted Vegetables tossed in Our House Vinaigrette with chopped fresh turkey and cheese. I loved it!!!\nThe other meal was the sonoma salad which didn't stand up to the Manhattan.  \n\nMeals cost between 10-20 bucks.  They have great lunch specials that are really dinner sized portions.  \n\nYou can't go wrong at the Grand Lux. It's located centrally inside the Venetian and open late.  Service was great each time!"

Luckily, there was not a long wait for a party of 6.\n\nLet me just put it out now. RUDE SERVICE!\nI don't care if it's Vegas or not vegas, if you're a server, you should have a good attitude no matter what restaurant or location you're at. Our server, I shall leave his name out of this review, was rude the moment he came to our table and asked for drinks. We had already been drinking all day at the pool and all we wanted were waters. He gave us this look of disgust and made a comment along the lines of just waters?... And just kind of walked away to let us look over the menus. It would have been nice too to introduce yourself too, sir.\n\nFinally when he came back to take our orders, I asked him if they put the ranch on the side or on the Buffalo Wings appetizer dish and he looked at me as if I were asking a stupid question. His reply was \"So you want it on the side...? Or just extra on the side...?\" I then had to explain to him to leave the ranch on the side because I was allergic to dairy and eggs. He then straight up said \"Well then you can't have them!! It has all of those in it\" in a tone of voice assuming I'm supposed to know this?! Forget it then. We ended up ordering the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for an appetizer and when it came to entrees, I ordered the Clams with Pasta dish. I asked him what kind of noodles they used and he said, \"Egg noodles. You can't have that either!\" I asked if they could substitute the noodles for non-egg noodles and he started listing off random noodles I barely recognized by name. I guess I had a confused look on my face because he just sighed and asked if I just wanted rice noodles instead. Done. Oh, and by the way, throughout this whole conversation over food allergies, this guy has the nerve to laugh and joke about it....\n\nFood comes out, he doesn't even come back to check on us until after we're almost done and it's only to ask if we wanted boxes. Honestly, this place is open 24/7 and I know for sure I would come back here after a night of drinking, but if all the servers here had this guys attitude, I would rather go to Denny's. Looking at the other reviews, it seemed like our table just got bad luck and got this horrible server. Overall, the food is pretty good with big portions. I would probably compare this place to a Cheesecake Factory with a Maggiano's ambiance."

My main complaint is their RIDICULOUSLY SLOW service, esp during the late night hours. Omg it was so slow. We were just two girls, but it was nearly impossible to get our check paid and gtfo to go to sleep at 5 am on a Fri night/Sat morning. We were about to fall asleep at our table. \n\nBoth times we went to Grand Lux on this trip, we just grabbed a table in the bar area to avoid waiting, and both times service was super slow.

He must have been especially friendly if that made an impression through my drunken haze.\n\nI would knock my rating down to a 3 for mind-numbingly slow service late at night, but I'll be nice because it's Vegas and everyone has a great time regardless.

The food is similar too but in my opinion, the quality is much much better here at the Grand Luxe. \n\nFor appetizers, the BF and I shared crabcakes which were sooo sooooooo goood! Loved the dipping sauce that came with it and the crabcake itself had perfect texture and flavor. Couldn't remember the cocktails we had but we loved them too - got us a pretty nice buzz going even before our main course.\n\nFor our main dish, I ordered the Miso Glazed Salmon and the BF had the Pasta with Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomato and Mushrooms tossed lightly in a garlic, creamy, parmesan cheese sauce. Both were superb in taste! \n\nBest part about this place? It opens 24 hours! Woooohoooo! Definitely a big plus when we stay at the Venetian! Helps with my usual late night munchies =)"

And you know what? The garlic- bleu cheese burger and fries were amazing.....even my slow braised short rib grilled cheese sandwich hit the spot. \n\nI have overloaded on bad white carbs yesterday and today but this was one of the times it was more worth it...and I'll do it again! =) service was wonderful and woohoo for 24hr restaurants that are GOOD!  It's far from our hotel but well the walk was worth it =D definitely recommend this place for some late night munchies and dining. =D I just wish had a bigger appetite to try their other dishes...which I heard everything on their menu is pretty good. The bill came out to be around $30 bucks for two and definitely much more satisfying than the places we have tried so far."

I ordered the ahi tuna burger and that was great!  They had a really good special sauce that goes along with it and it worked very well together!  Made my taste buds jump for joy!  The other girls said the clam chowder was really good and the pasta was really good.  This place is open 24 hours so that's a definitely plus.  The night before, after clubbing at Tao and Tryst, we came here for our after clubbing munchies!  I ordered the pasta with chicken, sundried tomatoes and mushroom.  It was quite bland when I had it.  The second night, my other girlfriend ordered it again and it was really good.  That sucks though that I had the bad batch!  Their prices are ok, moderate.

Jumbo Shrimp, Chicken, Onions and Sweet Ginger all Sauteed in a Delicious Spicy Sauce of Curry, Plum Wine and a Little Cream Topped with Sun-Dried Cherries and Apricots. Served with White Rice)  An explosion of flavors in your mouth.\n\nI also heard the Wiener Schnitzel (Austrian Style Thin Crispy Coated Veal Medallions.

Just from the gold decor, attentive well-dressed attentive servers, and the ambiance, you'll start thinking this is a pricey restaurant to eat at.  Nope...the Grand Lux Cafe is very affordable and the prices for their cafe/grill food mimics a local Denny's or IHOP.  But that's the just the prices that mimics these chain branded restaurants.  Food quality, presentation, service, and selection is all top notch here at the Grand Lux Cafe.  In other words, you cannot go wrong here.\n\nGrand Lux Cafe serves everything from breakfast to high quality meals like Filet Mignon.  Such a huge selection, I had to ask the waiter to give us extra time to decide.  In the meantime, we got our bread served and it was killed in minutes. For dinner, we shared the calamari which is also served with fried vegetables and fried shrimp.  I don't eat vegetables, but there's something about fried vegetables that makes it go down better.  The calamari was delicious, lightly breaded, and wasn't rubbery.  Yes..I've had overly chewy and rubbery calamari, but not here.  Cristina P. had a salad and I got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with a bowl of soup.  Let me add that there isn't a Crispy Chicken Sandwich on the menu, but all you have to do is ask and sometimes you shall receive.  My chicken sandwich was exactly how I expected it to taste...chicken breast that's golden fried, crunchy, tasty, and perfectly sandwiched in a hamburger type bun. \n\nIn all, I have to say that the Grand Lux Cafe is an easy stop if you're hungry, undecided, and in the Venetian.  There's plenty for everyone here and the price is better than most."

This place could and was also at the Hotel we were staying at. \n\nYeah it is like an upscale Cheesecake Factory. It looked nice enough and was packed. Service was excellent. \n\nThey bring out a warm loaf of bread while you check out the enormous menu. They're open 24hours and their menu is divided by times of the day so make sure you're looking at the right section. I ordered the Pasta with Chicken, Sun dried Tomatoes and Mushrooms. At first it was good but then the chicken was gone, then the tomatoes and mushrooms, and all that was left was a mass of pasta. I was already full by then but I wasn't really impressed by the dish. \n\nI got to taste the Sunday Night Pasta - \"Made Fresh Every Day! A Rich Slow Simmered Meat Sauce with Chunks of Beef Short Ribs, Steak, Fresh Mushrooms, Onions, Garlic and Parmesan Cheese. Served over Spaghettini.\" Tell me that doesn't sound good. Good thing I didn't order it. The \"chunks of beef short ribs and steak\" tasted like shredded beef. \n\nWe went back there at around 5am after the club and food-wise it was a better experience. For a table of 6 we must've waited about 20mins though. The Deluxe Breakfast Sandwich was GOOD! Scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, ham, grilled tomato, and Havarti cheese on grilled brioche bread. Probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had! The eggs were so fluffy, the meat was savory, and the melted cheese was delicious. I don't care for hash browns.\n\nSomeone ordered a hefeweizen and it came out an hour later from a bartender with attitude."

They're fine when you're wanting a nice dinner out but we just wanted something simple.\n\nWe walked past this place and decided to give it a try. I'm so happy we did!\n\nThere were several people in line to get a table and I was worried that we'd have to wait a long time for a table, but it's deceptively large and so it only took like 5 minutes for them to seat us.  We were seated at a table for 2 that one side is a long bench and the other side chairs.  So there were people next to us, but enough room for me to get in/out.  Even though we were close to the people next to us we didn't find it hard to hear each other and we couldn't hear anyones conversations except the ladies right next to us. That is such a plus in my mind.\n\nThe menu has lots of choices - pasta, salads, sandwiches, chicken dishes, steaks, etc.  this is a perfect place in vegas when you're with several people and not everyone wants just sushi or italian.  \n\nThey bring out nice warm bread (and butter) after seating you.\n\nMy husband and I both opted for hamburgers. He got the Max burger (with short ribs on the burger, hello!) and I got the bacon cheese burger. They easily substituted cheddar for me instead of american.  Burgers were about $12-13 each and came with fries or organic green salad.\n\nThis was the largest regular size restaurant burger I've ever had and also the best I've had. It truly looked as if when I ordered it, the guy in the kitchen pulled out some ground beef and made my patty by hand.  I couldn't even quite finish 1/2 of it.  And I can eat an entire red robin burger.  Seriously, it was just delicious. \n\nService was wonderful. The waitress seemed to notice every time we needed a refill on drinks and was quick to check on how things were going and bring extra condiments we wanted.  \n\nThis is a must eat place for me on any future trips to Vegas.  Next time though, we'll be splitting the burger, haha!"

But not to worry, despite their vast menu, the quality of food has NEVER suffered! The portions are huge but I never take it with me simply because my hotel room lacks a fridge and microwave for reheating purposed. The salads are always on point, fresh & crisp and not doused in heavy dressings. The pastas are always rich and creamy, and the sandwiches and appetizers are delicious.

I called 3 days before to make a reservation and was glad they were able to accommodate our big party on such short notice. They have a 15 minute wait policy where you will lose your reservations if you're more than 15 minutes late but are pretty accommodating as long as you call to keep them updated on your ETA.\n\nThe restaurant is very cute!  It has a cheesecake factory feel to it (I believe they're sister companies) but a bit more glamorous. The lights are dimmed and the decorations are fancy. It's a fun place to eat for a Bachelorette party or even on a romantic date! It's a very large restaurant so it isn't loud in there even with a restaurant full of people. \n\nThe food is also amazing!  The pasta portions are HUGE so it's best to share with another person since there is no way you'll be able to finish it (and yes that is a challenge lol). \n\nThe negatives that keep me from giving it 5 stars: our group waited about 45 minutes just for our food which is way too long for sandwiches and pastas. Our waiter sucked because he hardly came to check on us. Our drinks were always empty and we waited so long after we finished to even get our receipt. Hopefully we just got a bad server and you end up having better luck! Otherwise, this place was amazing!"

Whats great about the grand lux is that prices are reasonable, most dishes running about $15-$20 dollars, good food and good service.  At my last visit to the restaurant, I got the Memphis ribs, lunch portion.  It came with about 8 bones, a side of coleslaw and jalepeno cornbread. The ribs were nice and tender and the bbq sauce wasn't too sweat.  My friend had a problem with his order, he ordered a kobe burger and the waitress brought out kobe meatballs.  Manager came over to apologize for the mix up and offered him a cup of soup while he waited for his food since the rest of out food came out.  Unfortunately since they tried to rush the burger, the burger came out well done when my friend ordered med well.  When the bill came the waitress mentioned that they didn't charge us for the burger due to the mixup.  Mistakes happen, so we were not upset, and the manager did what he could to rectify the situation."

Breakfast - Lunch - Dinner - Late Night\n\nIt's VERY affordable and they give you generous portions.  Service is always excellent and the place is huge (the one in Venetian anyways) so there's never a long wait in line.  \n\nThey have a breakfast buffet (but it ends earlier than I'm usually awake.. like 11am?) and a hefty selection of lunch/dinner dishes you can order anytime.  The food isn't anything spectacular but it's yummy and you can't beat the price and amount of food!

Nothing to complain about; only compliments.\n\nMy buddy and I were in town for CES and in need of a no-reservations-needed dinner at around 8pm on a Friday.  I had been to the Beverly Hills Grand Lux numerous times in years past and always enjoyed it, but it never really stood out as a great restaurant to me.  When I called this Grand Lux there was no wait time, so we made our way there from Caesar's and were immediately seated.\n\nWe ordered a couple of drinks (I ordered the house Chardonnay, which was by Beringer and was a great deal at $7 and really good), looked over the menu and decided to share a few items.  The three we chose were:\n\nShort rib sliders - Four little sliders on brioche buns, stuffed with super tender and flavorful braised short rib and topped with a creamy horseradish sauce.  Fantastic!\n\nAvocado-Chipotle Cheeseburger - A pretty massive cheeseburger.  Messy and kind of hard to eat, but with delicious ingredients.  A nice kick, too.\n\nSpicy Carnitas Sandwich - An excellent mix of textures and flavors.  Crisp on the outside and super tender on the inside.  A great sauce was provided with this one and it was delicious.\n\nEach of the entrees came with a side salad, so for around $35 we had a great quality meal and were satisfied with the quantity of food, too.  Can't recommend this place enough."

Same 471 page food and drink menu which takes a good 30 minutes to read through. My favorite thing to order is the pot roast with mashed potatoes as I like to pretend that June Cleaver is my mother and she's whipped me up a beautiful meal. \n\nMy last memory of the Grand Lux Cafe is actually the inability to remember eating there.

The waiter wasn't very informative as to what was vegan, though he tried to make some suggestions.  After scouring the menu, I found something that looked like it would work.  I am so appreciative of the restaurants that go out of their way to make it easier for people that are vegan, gluten-free, vegetarian, nut allergies, etc... Vegas being a destination spot for people from all around the world, I think most of the restaurants are being progressive in offering alternative menus.  I hope that Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 hops on board! I ended up ordering the Pasta Fresca.  According to the menu it was cooked in olive oil with  eggplant, asparagus, mushrooms and  peppers.

We'd been pretty disappointed with most of the restaurants in the Venetian at this point in our trip, but it was early and we wanted to grab some breakfast.\n\nOur server (Aimee) pointed out that the breakfast buffet would be less than the meals we were considering since I was ordering orange juice, and the juice was included in the buffet.   I'm glad she recommended it, because it was a pretty decent breakfast buffet.  I think it was only about $10-12 and we were both very satisfied with the breakfast.  Lots of fruit, waffles, sausage, bacon -- pretty standard breakfast buffet fare, along with an omelet station.  Fresh squeezed orange juice (about $5 a glass) was included with free refills.  That alone was worth it.\n\nWe will not be staying at Venetian again for many reasons, but this was one of the few restaurant successes we saw there."

Nicely decorated atmosphere with plenty of dining tables around.\n\nWe each ordered the Salad and Pasta Lunch Special, which was very affordable and delicious at $10-$11. As always, the portions are huge and I was able to pack some leftovers even with a lunch portion.\n\nStaff here was very accommodating, quick, and knowledgable of their specials and food entre\u00e9s. Definitely coming back to The Grand Lux Cafe again for lunch or dinner.. At any location!"

It was about 10am and the person I was with said maybe we should share a meal and I agreed. I'm not a big fan of eggs Benedict but that's what we ordered. So when they came to the table the eggs weren't runny as they should be. \n\nI didn't want to send them back but my travel partner insisted and I thought sending them back was a bad idea. You never know what people will put in your food once you piss them off. We got the second eggs Benedict and one of them was runny, I didn't eat that one and the muffin was burnt. The waitress came and asked how the food was and we mentioned how the muffin was burnt. She apologized and left our table and told the manager.\n\nWell long story short my travel partner vomited twice within an hour. So the moral of this review is be nice to your waiter and don't send your food back. You should also watch the real funny movie \"Waiting\" with Ryan Reynolds. The waitress was so nice and even took the eggs Benedict of our bill."

No one ordered anything too fancy (salads, pasta, salmon, etc) but we watched as tables around us that were seated after us got their food, ate, paid and left. \n\nEveryone was very satisfied with their food though so I have to still give Grand Luxe credit. My chicken and avocado salad was very good: a large portion, lots of avocado, flavorful salad dressing. Other orders included the cedar planked salmon (always a crowd pleaser, my friend enjoyed it very much), the fried chicken, the gnocchi and pesto, spicy beef, and garlic shrimp pasta. No complaints about the food, the wait to get it was a doosy though."

This is the upscale version of Cheesecake Factory, so you will notice that the decor and menu is very reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory.  I love the food here and I love that it's open 24 hours!\n\nThis restaurant is located on the bottom level of The Venetian.  My friends and I were starving and got here around 1am to a short line.  Their menu consists of a section for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night.  Dinner lasts until midnight and late night is from midnight to 6am.  Lucky for us, they said they were still serving up dishes from the dinner menu when we got there so we had a wide array of options to choose from.\n\nMy friend and I both ordered an \"appetizer salad\".  I got the Greek Salad and added chicken.  My friend got their spicy calamari salad.  When we got our plates we were shocked because it was still a huge portion!  I added chicken to my salad because I didn't think I'd be full off just greens, oh how wrong I was!  Neither of us were able to finish it.  \n\nMy two other friends split an entree salad called the \"Sheila's Dream\" and it was sooo good!  Seriously, a party in your mouth.  It had an eclectic blend of ingredients and the dressing was top notch, I'm gonna get that the next time I come.  So worth the $12!\n\nEven though everything on the menu here is delish, I'd strongly recommend the Miso Glazed Salmon - best dish on the menu!!\n\nAs far as desserts go, their strawberry shortcake dessert here is excellent!  I'm inclined to say it is the best ever - it's fresh strawberries, shortbread, and cream all thrown onto a plate together so it isn't a sliced piece of cake like you'd find at other restaurants.  You just have to try it for yourself.  Drooool..."

First of all, we didn't order 2 steaks, and we shouldnt pay for both, and 2nd they said it would be comp'd so it should of been. we waited another 30 min for them to take it off the bill. it was horrible service, I would go back to this place eventually, but it wont be for a while."

I'm not making that up, it really is from  the creators of cheesecake factory.  In fact, I ended up liking this place better than CF. times ten.\n\nHas a wide range of entrees to choose from but not as much as big  \nbro.  They have some things that are similar, like some of the main  \ndishes, salads and desserts. But what cheesecake factory DOES NOT have are CHEESESTEAK ROLLS.  What it is.. Philly cheesesteak with cheese and mushrooms rolled in to a little, yummy appetizer. Crispy outside.. And warm philly cheesesteak inside.. but bitesized. (kinda like an egg roll..but not.. it's better.)   I had to rave about it because I liked it so much.\nThey also have comp bread n butta which was pretty good.  not the same bread as cf's.. equally as good as my favorite molasses bread.\n\nI ordered the chicken with sun dried tomatoes & mozzarella pasta and added  grilled shrimp to it.  It was screwdriver shaped pasta with creamy sauce, full of flavor.  I liked it!  Really really big dish, I ate alot and still had plenty of leftovers.\n\npeople in my party ordered salmon dishes.. one miso salmon dish (which tasted good, better than CF's) and one called \"salmon 3 ways\"  (which had 3 different flavors of salmon).. another ordered the combo of ribeye and shrimp scampi w. mashed potatoes.\n\nA big plus is that it's open 24 hours! Well, it IS vegas.  soo coming back to try the late night menu next time i'm there."

NOPE.  I've strayed before and it was a big big mistake. \nCrispy fried filets of fresh fish along with equally crispy and delicious fries.  To balance it all out there's a cup of fresh coleslaw with whole peanuts and a light asian inspired dressing (instead of the usual tart spoiled mayo taste).  \nThe other great thing about this place is that they don't care how drunk or tired you are... they're letting you in, and they're letting you eat.

Even though there is one in town back in LA and this one has been here in the hotel for years and years, this is my first visit to a Grand Lux; heck, even my daughter has been to this place with her friends before we've been here, so on this occasion since the four of us were all together as a family, she acted as our unofficial guide... \n\nThe Lux has a very casual cafe style and feel to it. Even though it was located in a posh hotel environment, you could tell that people came to this place in waves: basically before and after each showing nearby, and anytime there is a group or convention in the hotel. What I really didn't like about this particular restaurant was that the marble tile floors were so slippery. I remembered that I almost skid and ate shit once I got up from my seat, the floor had a thin veneer of grease or butter where I had stepped. I tried to warn our waitress who was standing close by to be careful about the slippery floor, but all she could muster up was that the floors were always slick and that she wore shoes with special soles. Great, what about us poor unsuspecting souls?.... \n\nEverybody here (on Yelp) seems to like the Chicken and Waffles so that's what I ordered. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=cfloeeSOVB7A2MUCpDsTdA Nice thick 8\" round Belgian waffle with deep nooks to hold the toppings and maple syrup and dusted with confectioners sugar, finally topped unceremoniously with fried chicken strips. Nothing wrong with the chicken strips as they were skinless chick boobs fried crisp in their stretched and mangled shapes, they were not greasy but a little dry because of the white meat. I still don't really get the whole chicken and waffles Southern style because I usually eat either one separately. All I can say is that I could only finish 3/4 of this incredibly heavy plate of carbs... \n\nAs a matter of fact, I was so disinterested in my meal at this glorified diner, that I didn't take much notice in what the rest of the family ordered. A Chicken Madeira plate,http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=fjfX7LmaHR1KwWj2UGc09A a Short Rib Cheddar Cheese Burger,http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=pa-WSyb4F6YJTe3J4O4__A and a Manhattan Salad w/turkey, avocado, and beets... \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=LjB39F-tysXCzG2owrYu5g\n\nThe good thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours, but for the price and convenience, I think I prefer the Peppermill down the strip a little more..."

That being said the quality is the same. Your pretty much paying for the ambiance. \n\nCame here around 3:30 in the morning. Had a terrible server. She look like she didn't want to be there. Never introduce herself and didn't refill our water glasses. The manager i believe at that time came by however often to check up on us told her to refill our water glasses but still nothing. \n\nFood Ordered:\nRib Eye Steak- Close to $30\nTerrible piece of steak. Told them medium rare but it came out medium well. I've had better steak at even Norms for goodness sake. The sides was nothing to write home about either. \n\nProbably won't ever eat here again. Terribly over hyped. Go for Secret Pizza or Earl's Sand Whiches after the clubs."

(3) Grand Lux Cafe was created by David Overton (founder of Cheesecake Factory Restaurants), (4) Accept all major credit cards\n\nWhat was ordered:\n\nCustomer Service (Complimentary) - Excellent - Jessica K was our server for this Wed 11:30 pm dining session.  Jessica was very personable and made great small talk about why we were here.  I was taking pictures of my friends and she offered to take a picture of me as well.  I declined, but she snatched my camera and proceeded to take my picture stating that I got pictures of my friends so it was only fair that I get a picture as well.  Jessica then offered to take a picture of all 3 of us afterwards.  Other than that, brought us everything we needed with a smile.  Nice gal.\n\nRib Eye Steak ($30.95) - Excellent - Cooked medium rare rib eye steak served with 2 onion rings, sprig of greens, and French fries.  Let me deconstruct the meal while I deconstruct the meal:\n\nRib Eye Steak - Excellent - Per Grand Lux Cafe menu \"We serve the finest Certified Angus Beef, corn-fed and aged up to 4 weeks for flavor, then seasoned and broiled at 1600 degrees to seal in the juices.\"  Quantity: Nice, large slab of meat.  Approximately 9 inches in length, 4.5 inches in width, and 1 inch in thickness.  Quality: Excellent.  The steak came with some fat, but it was quite meaty--I ate the fat because it's delicious (don't judge).  They cooked it to perfection with a nice pinkish middle and still juicy.  The steak pretty much melted in your mouth like butter.  Flavor: I don't know how else to describe it, but as \"Awesome and delicious!\"  Very flavorful beef that I was tempted to order another.  Other: My friend M ordered the same thing, but cooked medium.  He could not stop \"ooo\" and \"aaaahing\" about the steak.  He even declared it the best steak ever.\n\n(2) Onion Rings - Excellent - Quantity: 2 onion rings.  Quality: The BEST ONION RINGS EVER!!  The skin was perfectly golden with a nice crunch yet light when you bite into it--with very little oily feel.  I hate fast food places, chains, mom & pops serve these onion rings that have hard crusts and extremely oily.  Flavor: You really can taste the onion goodness here--it isn't hidden by the batter.  So good.\n\nSprig of Greens - Excellent - Quantity: A sprig.  Quality: I'm amazed about the attention to detail here.  If you think this sprig of greens is just garnishment, think again.  They actually put dressing on these greens--meant for consumption, not looks.  Think of it as a mini, mini, mini salad.  Flavor: Great flavor--sweetness and citrus acidity pop from the dressing and refreshing flavor from the greens.  The greens actually refreshes your mouth after consuming such bold flavors from the beef.\n\nFrench Fries - Excellent - Quantity: Approximately a 5 inch diameter bowl of fries--4 inches in height.  Quality: Nice golden brown color, perfectly crispy, and not oily.  Flavor: Tasted like good fries.  Seasoned well with a nutty flavor to them.\n\nLet me check off my Las Vegas Checklist:\n\n(1) Buffet - Nope - maybe Thursday morning\n(2) Gamble - Hell NO - I despise losing money\n(3) Club/Adult Entertainment/Events - Check - My Sac Kings lost to the Lakers.  Not going to make it rain this time.\n(4) Drink/Getting crazy loaded - Check - Gentleman Jack is your FRIEND. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/yZI0fAgC2XtddriDX2i3rA/l\n(5) Late Hour Dining - Check - Grand Lux Cafe is \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\""

With Cheesecake, you are guaranteed a reasonable experience with good food, enormous portions, and competitive prices.  Grand Lux is no different, AND the restaurant has a better menu.  \n\nPeople love their star chefs and fancy restaurants.  Maybe they live in parts of the United States where access is difficult and cannot compare the LV versions to the originals.  In my experience, they are often poor renditions or ghosts if you will, of their original versions (e.g. Craftsteak MGM vs. NY, Daniel Wynn vs. NY, and Bouchon Venetian vs. Napa).   The quality of food and service doesn't translate to Las Vegas, and I think the majority of people agree with me here.\n\nBut you can't say the same thing with Grand Lux.  It is a super-sized version of the Cheescake Factory; same decor but with better service and seating.  Wait-time is low, and the food gets served rather quickly.  Food quality is what you've come to expect - moderate to high. \n\nGrand Lux in the Palazzo is the best \"coffeeshop\" in a casino."

I was starving so I just sucked it up and ate it.  It was soggy and gleaming with oil.  Beyond unappetizing. \n\nI always found this place to be overrated and this trip proved it to me once again!"

Little did we know that this restaurant (and it's sister at the Palazzo, is in the same family as CF). We ended up here several time during our stay due to various reasons.\nOur first night here, we ended up having dinner due to the lateness of our check-in and simply being starving. We had a great waiter, and though the restaurant may be a sister to the CF, the menu is mostly different. The bread here is delicious and very crusty and basically a vehicle for butter. Great crust-and great butter. I ordred the four cheese pizza and added mushrooms and asked for the pizza to be cooked \"well done\".The husband ordered the chicken pot pie. When our meals arrived, the pot pie was in a GIANT bowl, covered with crust and my pizza was served Roman style (oblong not round) and was more chewy then I like. A few bites in, Kevin and I switched dishes. He loved the pizza as it was very flavorful, but texturally more to his liking. The pot pie had one of the most delicious crusts I have ever had, but the innards were kind of bland and boring. I had a crust and chicken dinner. We were too full for dessert.\n\nThe second time we came here was for dessert after the Jersey Boys where we learned that the dessert menu differs from the same restaurant in the Palazzo and our group was disappointed because we dined at the Grand Lux for dinner(at the P)and had our hearts set on certain desserts that weren't offered here. We did manage to order the strawberry shortcake (yummy) the key lime pie (good but afterwards a bit too tongue tart and the banana pudding with home made vanilla wafers. The wafers were the best part of this dessert, but the pudding itself was cloyingly sweet and our waitress wasn't too excited for our table of 6 only ordering dessert and water.\n\nOur third and last time at this location was for lunch with 2 of my girlfriends from high school who flew in on my birthday day. They were starving and chose to come here since they were also staying at the Venetian. We came down a bit after they had been there and had already ordered.  I had the miso salmon (a staple order for me at the regular CF) and it was much better here than what I have had at any CF with more vegetables, no butter sauce and a little kick. Kevin had the lunch  size pepperoni pizza and salad and the pizza was actually small enough to fit on the same plate as the salad. I had a bit, it was too greasy for me, but that is because of the pepperoni. My friends' had a Cuban and a Carnitas sandwich both served with fries and they both loved what they ordered. \n\nOf course the meal was served with the good vehicle for butter and yes, I had my fill.\n\nThis place is open 24 hours, with a late night menu, a breakfast menu a lunch time menu and the regular menu. If this was a place close to me, I would be a regular and not have shame since it was good."

That being said, the service was good, food presentation was attractive, and the place was clean. No points given up there. It's just that the food tasted like chain restaurant food to me. Maybe some folks like that, but when I eat out I want fresh tasting ingredients and quality foods. It is very hard to find that these days though.\n\nIf you are out for a meal with huge portions and a good palatable dining experience, then this place will be fine. The price is right too.

This cafe is operated by the Cheesecake Factory folks so you'll see may similarities in the menu as well. We prefer to go to the one at the Palazzo as the one at the Venetian can get quite busy and loud. We're usually able to just walk into the one at the Palazzo. Beware, most portions are sharable!"

The was another family waiting ahead of us and we pretty much just stood there for about 15 mins until I had to stop a server and ask him how long the wait was. He said I don't know I don't know how to run the computer.  Awesome I asked if he can ask the hostess he says yeah, anyway we were seated after 30 mins of waiting and being my first time I did not know they have complimentary bread but when I told the server if we get any complimentary bread she says its upon request. Well how would I know whether or not you have complimentary bread. Atleast asking us if it was our first Time here or not would have helped. When the manager brought our food I told him that the service so far is horrible.  He did not apologize for the wait and for the hostess not letting us know how long the wait is and for the bread he said That is why it's upon request. Yah if I knew that I wouldn't have asked! ITS MY FIRST TIME HERE. The server had the same answer. Obviously if the manager himself has such poor customer service, you caNnot blame the servers. The food was ok nothing special. And I have a big mouth, if I like a place I will go telling everybody because I have a saloon and a lot of contact with people but I will make sure I tell everyone about this horrible service I received and wouldn't recommend it to Anyone."

The Cobb salad was as good a salad as I have ever had at a restaurant; fresh, high quality chicken, bacon and blue cheese.  Wife loved her smaller chop salad.

I came here for lunch at 11 am and it was already overly bustling with people, waiters and plates and forks everywhere. They have the hugest most extensive menu of any cafe I've seen yet and all of it comes out looking delicious and tastes so as well.\n\nI had a chance to have a go at their breakfast menu and it's great, they do serve some breakfast items all day but also have a specialty breakfast portion until 11 am.

As were leaving, we made a friendly and light-hearted comment to a gentleman, who appeared to be the manager, regarding the slippery and greasy floors.

One word of advice, they salt and pepper their salads in addition to pre-tossing your salad with dressing before severing it. Therefore, it was very salty. I would advise you to ask that they not top off the salad with salt and if you also prefer, dressing on the side. I found this out wehn the manager came by to apologize after I asked if they could make me another salad with less dressing. The dressing was fine it was the extra salt. I wouldn't image why they would do that.

This came with what tasted like a hoisin sauce & a yellow horseradish sauce.  The horseradish sauce was good... tangy with a kick.  This platter is huge.

Everyone RAVES about this dish.  It's under the \"LARGE SALADS\" section and it is huge.  I do not recommend that you eat this by yourself, piggy.  The only bad thing was that the avocados weren't ripe enough and thus, a little firm.\n\nMiso Glazed Salmon: Served with Rice and Stir-Fried Vegetables.

It's not under or over cooked.... just right!\n\nSERVICE: I was very disappointed with our server: Lori H.

There is also a location on the Palazzo side near the elevators to the rooms that is a little less busy.\n\n2. The theme of the restaurant and even the menus scream Cheesecake Factory to me, but the restaurant has very much it's own character.\n\n3. Open all night! A great destination to unwind from post-clubbing shenanigans.\n\nI love the Grand Luxe Cafe because the times that I've gone there, the servers are not only friendly and willing to give suggestions, but also they are efficient and quick.\n\nVegas is all about moving from one place to the next, sleeping, and then starting all over the next day. Grand Luxe offers the time for people to cool their heels with decent, quality food. My girlfriend usually orders a pasta dish, while I always try something more adventurous since we're always on a vacation.\n\nIt's so sad, but they took away one of my favorite menu items, a carribean style jerk pork chop dish. It had amazing textures and flavors through it, but I guess it wasn't really a popular choice among diners. Anyways, back to other foods, you will always leave Grand Luxe stuffed since the portions are huge and the food is pretty yummy.\n\nOne of the things that I really like about Grand Luxe is the price. Though it's $15-18 a plate, the food is still cheaper than dining at most of the sit-down restaurants across the strip. Furthermore, it's not like we waited for more than 10 minutes to get into the place. If it is too busy, and you are willing to do a bit of a walk, you can get to the Palazzo side that sees much less customers.\n\nAnyways, I hope you guys try out Grand Luxe Cafe!"

What I tried:\nIndochine Chicken and Shrimp:  I tried to get my bf not to order this because I figure we shouldn't go \"ethnic\" at a non-ethnic restaurant.  I'm glad he went ahead and ordered it anyway.  I suppose Indochine is a social construct/concept anyway, and not really ethnic... ok back to the food.  It was a good!  A bit sweet for my taste, but definitely way better than I expected.\nCreamy Chicken Soup:  Yum yum, how can you go wrong with soup?\n\nMy boyfriend, the mojito addict, ordered 2 of them for $11 each.  That's more than they charge at the Factory, just to let you know.  Basically, this place was better than any Cheesecake Factory I'd ever been to, but I think they overcharge for their drinks.  For what it was though, this is a 4-star.  Props for being open 24 hours."

It is conveniently open 24 hours and is reasonably priced. \n\nMy group of 4 came here for breakfast after a night of partying. There wasn't a wait, and the restaurant is huge with plenty of seating. Does feel kinda grand inside. The overall look, especially with the orange lighting, is reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory, which is owned by the same company. \n\nThe highlight of our meal was the exceptional service we got from our waiter, Mike. He was friendly and personable and checked up on us regularly. I don't usually take note of server's names (although I should start to), so that means he did a really good job.\n\nI ordered the corned beef hash that comes with two eggs and hashbrowns. The corned beef had just the right amount of fattiness. The sunny side up eggs were cooked perfectly with the yolks still runny. And potatoes are always a must for me for breakfast. The portions are pretty big, so we all ended up taking leftovers back to our room. The only con about the dish was that it was a tad too oily and greasy, which made me feel a little nauseous towards the end. But the rest of their menu sounds promising. Will definitely be back whenever we stay at the Venetian or Palazzo!"

So last weekend, we do the walk from the Aria to the Venetian (really long walk) in search of this restaurant. It seems counterintuitive that this great food comes out of this normal looking casino restaurant, but it really was good. \n\nI've been on a pasta carbonara fix (trying to relive my amazing Rome dining experience), so I ordered it with low expectations since every other place has been terrible. I have to say that this was the best pasta carbonara that I've had outside of Rome. It was a very cheesy cream sauce and with actual thick cut bacon. The whole meal tasted like smoked bacon. The lunch portion was huge and since it was very rich, I couldn't finish it. My husband ordered the short rib burger (short ribs are a topping on the burger) and he liked it a lot. Dad ordered the ribs and mom the ahi salad, which they both loved just as much the first time. \n\nUnfortunately, there were some cons. My husband's burger came without any dressings/sauces, which is a little strange. He had to ask for mayo and our server said he'd have to go to the kitchen to get it. My mom asked for soy sauce and wasabi. Our server told us they only had soy sauce, which was a lie because they had a wasabi dressing for the ahi appetizer. I suspect the wasabi dressing was in the kitchen and our server didn't want to go back after retrieving the mayo.\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely go back and I'd order the pasta carbonara (maybe to share next time) in a heart beat."

The service was good overall, and the waiter didn't stop by so many times that he became annoying (props), but on to the food.\n\nWhat people say is true, the Asian Nachos are pretty good. Sweet, tangy, savory, and salty with crispy wonton chips and meaty chopped chicken. A plate of these is pretty much a meal in itself.\n\nThe avocado-chipotle burger and the delux drive-in burger were both decent, but super greasy.The portion sizes are good though, and they give you a choice to swap sides. I had the salad w/ vinaigrette and it was good (left me feeling a little less fat).

The chicken was very lean and seasoned well.\nCorned beef & eggs: I have never seen corned beef prepared the way Grand Lux does it. Usually, the corned beef I order is a little mashed up and thin.

Just thinking about their red velvet pancakes makes me wanna go back. THE best red velvet pancakes you will ever find. Out of all the red velvet foods I've had, Grand Lux has convinced me that pancakes are the best way to have them. There's no way I'll ever be in Vegas without stopping by for their pancakes.\n\nService was decent. The food came pretty fast, but our waitress had a very \"fake\" attitude. She said everything a little too perky and she talked to our entire table like we were kids. But whatever. She was the last thing on my mind. I was too distracted by the food haha."

            "review": "This afternoon on a staycation with family, we ate in the Grand Lux Cafe.With a location in the Venetian, I felt like I was transplanted to a cafe in Venice.\n\n  Grand Lux Cafe is the upscale brand of the Cheesecake Factory. The restaurants are upscale with decent prices. They include a bar and bakery.\n\n The Cheesecake Factory website states that the Grand Lux Cafe came into existence when the Venetian asked David Overton, who was the founder of Cheesecake Factory to design an upscale restaurant for his resort. The story goes that he went all over Europe doing culinary research. The research resulted in the very first Grand Lux Cafe-where we had lunch this afternoon. \n\n  Our experience was that Grand Lux Cafe is upscale and affordable. Our table overlooked the extravagant Venetian. \n\n In my opinion, where the menu shines is the lunch special. It is from 11 to 5. The lunch specials include Lunch soup/ salad ($10.95), Rustic pizza & salad ($11.95), Lunch salad ($9.95-11.95), Lunch enchiladas ($11.95), Lunch pasta & salad ($10.95-$11.15), and Lunch salmon ($13.25).\n\n  I was going to order the Lunch pasta & salad. When I asked the Waitress if the lunch portion is enough to fill you up, she answered that depends on your appetite. With that nebulous answer, I ordered the BLT with french fries. I don't think this was the kind of dish that David Overton was researching in Europe. Overall I was happy with the food.\n\n  I enjoyed having lunch in Grand Lux Cafe. I was off from work and with family. It is not too often that I get to have lunch in Venice. It was a change of scenery with good food that I appreciated. I am showing this appreciation with a 4 star rating.\n\nThe Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 50."

Staying in this part of the strip, my pals and I are always looking for a quick bite in a sit-down restaurant and we haven't found anything as tasty and convienient as the Grand Lux.  Even if the line is long the wait is usually less than 15 minutes.  The menu is huge and there should be something for everybody.  The portions are big and the food served pretty quickly.  The place is huge too!  It must hold hundreds of diners.   My only complaint is having to navigate through the people-movers, escalators and stairs in the front of the Venetian."

Some people have mentioned a large line and little wait time, we found both the line and wait time nonexistent. The lady who escorted us to our seat was pleasant, asking me how my day was doing. I found the personalized attention refreshing. Once seated, our server could not have been better. She gave us the perfect amount of time to go through the menu before we were ready to order, and continually checked up on us and refilled our drinks without us asking. Our food came out in a timely fashion, and all was cooked to perfection- fish and burgers alike. As for dessert, we ordered a cheesecake, a cupcake creation, and a slice of key lime pie. The key lime pie was flavored perfectly-not too much and not too bland. The cheesecake was rich but tasty, and the cupcake dish was devoured in minutes.\n\nAll in all, an affordable and delicious choice for dinner. You can easily dress up or come casual- matters not. The lighting could be romantic if you wanted, or comfortable with friends. I plan to make this a traditional stop when I am here in Vegas and strolling the Venetian."

As you can imagine, the obvious error occurred. I was sitting outside the Grand Lux at Venetian (with no cell service, go figure) and I couldn't locate him. After 30 minutes I was finally able to locate a spot on the casino floor where I could get service. I called my man and tried to describe where I was in relation to him as he said he had been sitting inside the restaurant all this time. This being his first time inside either the Venetian or the Palazzo, was easier said than done. I finally convinced him to head to the other Grand Lux, which is where I thought I was. 10 minutes later, still no sign of him. Seriously? I was getting agitated. I finally got service again and was able to contact him. He described where he was and I was able to ascertain that he was actually at the Grand Lux opposite from me. Ooops, we were both at the same location from the beginning. I'll own it, that was my mistake. How he walked passed me without me noticing him on his way to the other Grand Lux, I'll never understand. As there are two locations at adjoining casinos, I have to hope that I'm not the only one this has happened to, or are we just that dumb? \n\nFinally, we're seated and ready to eat. I've been here a number of times before. Usually for some late night grub. The food isn't spectacular. I had a very regular omelette with no bells or whistles and my guy had a very regular sandwich. The food is standard cafe fair. I like the food ok, it's just nothing amazing. If I'm in the area, I'd probably prefer to go to First Food & Bar for their amazing strip views and fun bar foods, but this is a good alternative as well. There are lots of desserts, so check those out as well."

I would describe Grand Lux Cafe as a upscale Cheesecake Factory, but a little bit more expensive. It seems that every single time that I am in Vegas, I end up here. From prior experiences, I would have rated this place a 4-5 star, but it did not meet my expectations this time around. It will definitely make me hesitate whether or not I would want to dine here the next time around. Did my eagerness and excitement for this place finally die? \n\nWe arrive and sit in a booth in the bar area because we wanted to watch the Lakers game that was on. \n\nBeing in the mood for a burger, I ordered The Max Burger which had certified angus beef topped with cheddar cheese, Applewood smoked bacon, sauteed mushrooms, onions and roasted short ribs, with Fries. It was good, but not good where I was jumping with joy. \n\nOur waitress Jina was on PMS the whole night. \n\nShe was rude and the gf kept noticing it. I was paying attention to the game so I dont know what exactly was going on. I can tell you what I heard from the gf though. She was working as if she hated her job and did not want to be there. She would roll her eyes whenever we wanted some more water, drinks, etc. She was throwing some of our dishes onto the table. She was telling us to move our drinks out of the way in a rude way so she could set down our dishes. She was fat. She was ugly. She was Jina."

The food and wait staff remains good as ever, but the management was what let me down.  We were in town over the weekend for our annual basketball tournament and our team of families are very close knit which means dining together and having fun.  I called in advance to make a reservation for a large party of 35 (their website states that they do take them) but I was told that due to the day and time which was a Saturday morning 11:30am and peak time for them (according to the mgr) they could not and would not accept reservations.  We chose to walk-in together, but each family got their own tables.  Keep in mind all thirty five of us walked in together giving our names and party number one right after another.  They seated us sporadically so we were far apart from each other, not fun.  What I was upset about was clearly seeing two areas that were completely empty and could have easily accommodated us.  If a restaurant has a 550 seat capacity, how difficult would it be to put 35 people together especially when there is clearly room available?  Due to this, I have decided that we will dine at other establishments as a team (see my Nora's Italian Cuisine review) when we return for our yearly tournaments.  There are plenty of restaurants who can accommodate us."

Plus is it open 24 hours......\n\nWe walked in here at 11pm on a Tuesday and were greeted and quickly seated. Our server however, was not a happy camper that day. It took her 15 minutes to acknowledge our presence or ask us for our drink order. Since we were starving, this annoyed us a little more that day. Avoiding another delay, we ordered everything at once. Once she had our order, she huffed and puffed away. \n\nBTW I must mention that this place is similar to the Cheesecake Factory (or so I was told when we checked in to the Venetian). Based on the menu, I can agree a 100%. It was 10 pages long - you have small plates, almost big plates, big plates etc. and the prices seemed to match those at the Cheesecake Factory. It took me 10 minutes to find what I wanted to eat and that also after scanning through only half the menu - maybe that is why the service is so slow - they like to give you time to go through the entire menu :)\n\nSourdough bread is complimentary, however it was hard and dry and not comparable to nice warm bread. Maybe this is something the restaurant can change. \n\nFor our food, we got the Asian nachos (based on the yelp comments and reviews) and volcano shrimp to start off. The Asian nachos are a MUST TRY. The nachos are freshly baked, crispy, with a sweet sesame topping, chicken, cheese and rice. The chicken is tangy and juicy, and the cheese does not overload the nachos (which is usually what I find on most occasions). The volcano shrimp were fried shrimp (the regular) but the dipping sauce was interestingly tasty - Spicy Chilli Aioli. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered the Indochine Shrimp and Chicken and my wife got the Pasta Pomodoro. Both these plates were good enough for 2 people each (so all in all we got food that could feed 4). I enjoyed my Indochine Shrimp and Chicken, even though it was on the sweeter side with raisins and really lacked the Indian spices it claimed to have. The chicken in this dish was probably a little under-seasoned but the shrimp counterbalanced the chicken in this case. My wife's Pomodoro was plain pasta in tomato sauce and nothing really out of the blue, other than a huge plate of food.\n\nWe waited another 15 minutes after finishing to get our check before walking out satiated though not thoroughly happy. The lack of seasoning and flavor in the Chicken (Indochine Shrimp and Chicken) and pasta (Pomodoro), and the poor service makes me give the place a 3 stars."

And there's a big Grand Luxe in LA as well.

But anyway, I decided to check it out as our last lunch/meal in Vegas before we had to board the shuttle. It was a Saturday afternoon, and the rush of people on the streets was insane, so it took us a good 20 minutes or so to get to the Venetian. I love that hotel so much - so gorgeous, but we didn't have any time to explore, so we rushed over to the Grand Lux (very easy to find) and got seated right away. It's a very big restaurant, with plenty of seating and a very \"grand\" and beautiful interior, but it was PACKED! \n\nWith the little time that we had left, my boyfriend and I rushed through the menu and he ended up getting the Buffalo Chicken Rolls and I got the Spicy Flat bread Chicken sandwich - very good! My only concern was that the food took forever, so we literally had 10 minutes to eat and we had to go right away. The doggy bag came into good use when our plane was delayed for 5 hours... \n\nAnyway, this place reminds me so much of Cheesecake Factory, but that makes a lot of sense considering it's the same owners. With that being said, the menu is endless, so I will def be making my way back here next time I am in Vegas. I LOVE the fact that it is 24/7, and I wish I knew that when I was there Fri night around 4 am when we were starving and everything around Cosmo had closed. \n\nService was good, but like I said, the food took way too long.

This I assumed meant they had the best food/service around which everyone clearly knew about.

The flavor was OK, but it was extremely watery.\n\nThe person who took my order wasn't my waitress and when my actual waitress came by she tried to take my order again.  I saw it happen again at another table which could have meant that one lady was poaching tables or the other was a step behind - tough to tell.\n\nAnyway, the food wasn't bad and the service was pleasant once I was seated.\n\nI would go back to try something else but there's no way I'd stand in line for 40 minutes to do so."

This place is like another Cheesecake Factory because it has a different variety of foods.\n\nFirst off, the portions are HUGE. We were warned by the server, but I didn't think it'd be that big. We ordered 3 pastas and 2 appetizers for five people. We only finished one appetizer...\n\nFor starters, we had the calamari and Thai crispy rolls. The breading didn't stick to the calamari, which just made it okay. I thought the Thai crispy rolls were just alright also, but my friends really liked it. The crispy rolls were the only thing we finished.\n\nWe all agreed that the best item we ordered was the Garlic Shrimp pasta. I like this dish because it wasn't too heavy for pasta. The pasta with Grilled Chicken, Sun Dried-Tomatoes, and Mushrooms was pretty good also. I didn't really enjoy the Pasta Carbonara because I don't like bacon and it kind of overpowered the dish.\n\nThe service was really good. It was the best service we had in Vegas. Our server was really friendly and attentive. I wish I had her name so I could give her some recognition.\n\nI wanted to give this place four stars, but it's just not a four star restaurant to me. I don't know how to explain it... I would probably come back to this place because it's affordable to eat in Vegas. It's also open 24 hours so I'd pick this place to eat when I'm drunk too."

The smoked salmon dish is not bad, nothign special but fresh. I use to love their chicken piccata, but the last time i had it, it wasn't so good (the previous 3 times were good :)... their clam chowder is amazing! and their chopped salad was not bad. Good size chopped ingredients and not over dressed so it didn't get too soggy near the end. At first I was nervous about ordering a chopped salad b/c i'm a stickler on texture and dressing... but was pleasently surprised.\n\nI have to note, girls becare of the floor.

Now this can be quite a hard task to cater 18 people but they had numerous mistakes that were simply aggravating. \n\nHalf of our table was completely ignored for ordering both the drinks and food. The appetizers were already coming to the other guests before we had to insist on ordering drinks. \n\nAlso the food orders started coming out wrong as well. Appetizers were brought instead of the actual main course. \n\nLuckily however the food is fantastic. I had the Mediterranean Mahi Mahi and it was some of the most flavourful fish I have ever had. Everyone else at the table as well were raving about the food. \n\nIt may have been that we caught the waiting staff on a bad night.

The menu is extensive, although not as scary as a Cheesecake Factory menu, and the portions are big.  The breakfast items are a good deal, came with 3 eggs, hash browns, meats.  But there are also other things like noodles to sandwiches. \n\nService wasn't great my first morning, the waitress seemed a bit confused and wasn't attentive to our table.  Food also took a little while to come out and one of our orders came out wrong.  Even when we were switched to a new waiter things didn't quite improve.  On the second morning had a much better waitress and food came out a bit quicker.  Probably shouldn't expect too much at this time of day.  \n\nI don't think there is anything mind blowing on the menu, but it's decent grub when you need some food and they're open.  Variety on the menu let's you choose if you want breakfast/lunch/dinner.  Portions are good, price is medium.  It's definitely a decent option depending on what time of day it is and where you're staying."

However, each portion was way bigger than I thought. For the drink, my bf had beer, while I got orange & strawberry smoothie in a big glass was super good that I kept drinking instead of eating food, but still couldnt finish, therefore I had to ask my bf to suck it up 'cause I didnt want to waste it. \nI love the service here, my waiter was nice, friendly & attentive, he came by few times to ask if everything was ok, and another gentleman which I guessed its the manager came over to check on us making sure we're well served.

I consider myself a somewhat optimistic person, but I am at a complete loss for positive things to say about this place. I went here at brunch/lunch time to grab a quick bite before heading back to a conference, and I now wish I would've made the walk to McDonalds so I would've had some quality food and service - you heard right, McDs is quality compared to this junk.\n\nMy friends both ordered omelettes and I went with a chicken sandwich that involved avocados. The food wouldn't have even been all that bad if they wouldn't have... A) taken 25 minutes to deliver the goods, B) forgotten to tell us that they messed up our order and needed a few extra minutes, C) neglected to explain their mistake, D) placed my food under the warmer so that my bun became burnt and my lettuce an ever-appetizing wilty black, E) neglected to say one more word to us the entire meal - not even thank you.\n\nSometimes a restaurant delivers crappy food but the service makes up for the mistakes, and sometimes a black hole emerges in the kitchen and maliciously sucks in every hint of good service and humanity of the entire staff. I probably should have expected all of this knowing that the restaurant the bastard child of Cheesecake Factory, but that damned blind optimism got the best of me. Spend the extra cash and go somewhere else, or go to the food court and get a respectable panini, or just don't eat and get a martini instead - any option is a step in the right direction as long as it is a step away from Grand Lux.\n\nAlso, a side note - there was something like 200 items to order from on this menu, meaning that I can rest assured that the entrees have been frozen longer than Ted Williams, yum yum."

I ordered the pasta with sun dried tomatoes basil and chicken. Freaking delicious, yes. Weird down side to this place, was that the floors were extremely slippery, I had to ice skate myself around.

BUT IT'S OKAY, because he apologized profusely and gave us a complimentary dessert at the end. The buffalo chicken sando itself was spicy and friend and huge and perfect, and I am certainly glad about his mistake. I also tried my friend's kobe burger and it was really, REALLY tasty. One note, though: don't come here when you're counting calories.\n\nFor (free!) dessert, the waiter brought out a Warm Butter Cake, which was, frankly, THE BEST. It tasted sort of like a waffle not in a waffley shape, and the ice cream and strawberries just really completed it.\n\nOverall, definitely an choice place for some late night dining, if you can excuse having deja vu of your local Cheesecake Factory."

My favorite touch to this burger was the thick whole-grilled red onion slice. \n\nThe burger also comes with fries, but you can opt. for a different side: I opted for the steamed brocolli that is NOT slathered in butter (thank goodness) -- they steam whole heads of brocolli for you. How unique. Ha. \n\n2) Polynesian Salad, $14ish\n- VERY huge and fresh tasting. Sweet, tangy sauce over greens with chicken slices and lots of other excitement I can't recall..\n- Loved how they top the salad off with whole pieces of fried wonton instead of mixing in bits and pieces into the salad. It's great because it gives u the option of NOT eating the friedness (cuz...u know...it would be healthier that way) and makes the presentation look cooler simultaneously!\n\n3) Sunday Night Pasta, $17ish\n- VERY VERY huge!

My friend could only eat 1/3! =P\n\n4) CREME BRULEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, $7.50ish -- GET THIS!!!\n- For this price, you get TWO huge servings of a vanilla and chocolate delicacy with a waloop of whipped cream that easily satisfied 3 people!!!

Another major plus about Grand Lux is that they're open 24 hours. Probably the best classy food you can get at 3 in the morning. Nice ambiance and pretty decent service overall. The best way to describe the food is traditional with a modern twist. Asian nachos- love the combination of crispy won tons and all the awesome toppings that come with it like chicken and wasabi cream. I tried the banana pudding and it was amazing as well. The banana pudding wasn't too sweet and it also came with chocolat dipped bananas sprinkled with peanuts. The vanilla wafers that came with it tasted home made, which I loved! I heard the caramel chicken is tasty. I will have to order that next time I'm there. The Beignets is probably my favorite dessert but they do not offer it at this location and only at the Palazzo one."

Our server took 30m to take our order and he only had another table to serve. Attitude at this restaurant is something else. We asked to place order and other servers refused to take our order or communicate with our server for us.\n\nIt took another 30m for our food to come out, and the food was not that impressive. Nobody brought us ketchup or refill our drinks. When we ask the servers to do so, they didn't want to do that and told us we had to speak to our main server (who was nowhere to be found). At the end, we finished our meal without condiment or water.\n\nI felt like I could have been better off eating at McDonald. At least, they will give you ketchup there."

Came here before when staying at the Venetian, as it's open 24 hours (or until the wee hours) so always a place to dine whenever you're hungry in Vegas.\n\nWe came here for lunch on our first day, and I just wanted a small meal since we were eating dinner in a few hours. The lunch special of half a sandwich, soup, and salad stood out to me and was a reasonable $9. Their complimentary bread was not my cup of tea since it's not very soft, but that was better for me so I could save my appetite for my lunch. The butter here is really tasty though!\n\nAlthough the restaurant was not busy, our food took forever and a day to come out. When it finally did I was pleased with my dish, as it was a good amount of food for the price. The salad was tasty, and they brought my blue cheese dressing on the side. The chicken mushroom soup was pretty tasty, and they give you a huge cup of it! My BLT however...the bread was so badly burnt, I didn't eat any of the bread. Also, I like my bacon chewy, but these were burnt to a crisp. Stole some of my friends' fries and dipped it in their yummy ranch so I got my fill of carbs.\n\nThey also brought out a complimentary birthday treat for my friend, and their whipped cream was light and yummy, and the crisp that came with it was also light and tasty as well.\n\nOverall, we all enjoyed our meals, but just wished service was quicker."

Four hungry people each craving something different. Where to go? Oh yeah, and good luck getting a table at this time of day, right?\n\nWell, we were in luck. We saw the Grand Lux Caf\u00e9. After checking out the menu we were relieved to see that the menu was so diverse. There really is something for everyone. It seems to cater to the myriad of diverse pallets wandering through the hotel at any given time. There is a link to their \"Full Menu\" on the right side of this page. Guess what?--that ain't their full menu. That is a teaser. The best part was that despite what looked like a large volume of people waiting for a table the hostess ensured us that it would only be a 5 minute wait. (And it was).\n\nThey have everything from burgers and steaks to pastas, pizza and seafood as well as a large selections of salads. There's nothing exotic here, mind you, it's all standard North American fare. If you're a food blogger looking to write about your latest culinary conquest you might be a little sad.\n\nI got the Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella. It was served in a large dish and as mentioned earlier, portions were generous. Not bad for $16--ish.\n\nA special mention should be made of our friendly and outgoing server. We never did get her name unfortunately. It's always great to receive amazing service that's equal to the delicious food you're getting.\n\nMy only gripe is that we were seated next to the area where customers wait for a table to open up. The dining and waiting areas are separated by wrought iron fence. The people waiting have tendency to lean on the fence, sticking their fingers through it and talking loudly amongst themselves with no respect for the people eating on the other side of it. Their was even a child trying to climb the fence at one point. If the staff try and seat you in this area I would suggest that you just wait for a table to open further inside the restaurant."

It's half a chicken, breaded in this amazing batter and deep fried to perfection. It's served with mashed potatoes and peanut cole slaw. It is so good. KFC got nothin' on this. Seriously, it's amazing. It's enough for two people, too.\nCream of Chicken & Mushroom Soup - This soup is the bomb. Just trust me on this.\nDeep Dark Fudge Cake - One of my favorite chocolate cakes I've had, ever. It is rich and extremely chocolatey. A must try if you come here!\n\nPRICE. Not too shabby, compared to other Vegas restaurant prices. The servings are huge so you get your money's worth for sure.\n\nSERVICE. This is where they lost a star. The service I received on my most recent visit was sub par. Our waiter was M.I.A. most of the time, failed to refill our drinks and bread basket, and took forever bringing us what we asked for. The restaurant was busy when we got there, but the crowd died down after a while. I understand these waiters are juggling a bunch of tables at once, so no complaints were made. It just would've been nice to have quicker service. Not to mention, it took thirty minutes for our food to come out! Yikes!\nI usually order over the phone and just pick it up to eat in my hotel room. I highly recommend that. The service is quick and you get to eat in bed (score!).\n\nOVERALL.

They have a huge menu, just like the Cheesecake Factory, tons of stuff to order. \n\nThe other five (5) ordered these spicy bloody marys, man they tasted great. Hot and peppery, with pickled asparagus on top. After taking a taste of the g/f's (can't use her name) (actually don't know why I can't) I wished I had ordered one too. But I went with the old standby, ice tea, boring but thirst quenching. \nTwo in the party went for the breakfast sandwich, it was stuffed with ham,bacon,scrambled eggs, cheese on thick cut toasted bread. They devoured them like finger food. I had the Manhattan salad with shrimp and chicken. It looked better then it tasted. I'm not sure what it was missing but I wouldn't order it again. \nService was good, food was hot and fresh, and they refilled my ice tea several times without asking for it. That's always a plus for me, I love to get bloated on ice tea while I eat."

You want a restaurant atmosphere, but don't want to pay $200 just to have a meal for two. Yet, you don't feel like paying $15 for a greasy Philly Cheesesteak at the food court. Grand Lux is your middle ground restaurant. Its owned by the creators of Cheesecake Factory and its basically the same to me. Different menu, but still diverse and extensive. Perfect when you need something casual and have a lot of mouths to feed.\n\nMy first experience was very pleasant. I had the most attentive, kind, and honest waiter I've had in years....and...he was new!  When I first ordered, he made sure my party knew that the portions are generous. Personally, I like it when they're honest that the portions can be too much and sharing is encouraged for people with smaller appetites, even though it could affect their total tip.\n\nI ordered a pasta and requested for no olives. The kitchen made a mistake and added olives so they had to redo it. I never saw the plate with the olives because my waiter caught it before it was delivered to me. He apologized repeatedly for the tardiness, but I was fine since I wasn't in a hurry and he was just so nice...its hard to be upset. The manager also came over to apologize at one point. Finally, I got my pasta. I just wish they would clarify that it was chicken chorizo on the menu, it makes a difference since I was expecting large chunks/slices of chicken.\n\nI ended up tipping the guy almost 25% in cash and wished him luck before he left. He was such a doll, I would take him home.\n\nSecond time I went? Disaster! Snobby waiter who was giving us horrific service. Ignored us most of the time, didn't like the fact that a couple members in my party wanted to share a meal. When he was passing the meals over, he wouldn't even lean over to hand me mine, he just held it up in the air and I had to reach for it. Didn't refill my drinks until I was getting ready to leave! What's the point then? Didn't even give our party a basket of bread unlike the tables surrounding us. Lazy!\n\nHowever, I think he's just the bad apple of the group. As my previous waiter was great and the manager wasn't bad either.\n\nI would still go here just because it is nice to have something in the middle for dining, plus the menu accommodates just about anyone that's with you. I just hope my service is as good as my first visit."

Shrimp scampi is not scampi at all. The shrimp is breaded (?!) and served in a cream sauce, not butter. The parmesan crusted pork chop was the tastiest of the dishes, but side vegetables were limp and lukewarm. I'd also mention the gin and tonic was weak, but watered down cocktails are a Vegas tradition. The restaurant is more than usually noisy. This can be helped slightly by requesting not to sit near the open kitchen. Our wait staff (more than one server per table) were friendly and attentive. Since this is open 24 hours, I'm sure there is a convenience associated with the higher ratings - when you're a bit tipsy and everything else is closed, you don't care much about quality at 2am. If you're looking for a nice evening of semi-casual dining, however, there are other options."

            "review": "I recently went here because I heard it was almost like Cheesecake Factory. However, what started off as good service (being seated fairly quickly for a large group) was a plus until we realize how absolutely LONG we had to wait for our food. Our server forgot about us or something? While everybody else around us was getting their meals, we were wondering what happened to ours?? We had to ask a person who was not even our server for BREAD. We were seriously all famished and were getting extremely grumpy. I guess the manager realized we waited long and as a kind deed, he gave us free orange juice. \n\nAfter waiting what seemed like hours, we got our food. I got the combination of the salad/fetucini alfredo and I was extremely eager to eat. Once I took my first bite into my pasta, I was disgusted with the amount of salt in it. I never taste such a salty pasta dish in my life! I thought I was the only one, but my friends tried and agreed it was extremely salty. My other friends ordered pasta/salad combo and it was super salty as well! I do NOT recommend the nasty salty fetuccini alfredo. It was so salty I didn't eat it anymore. I do not recommend this place, nor would I ever go back. I am sure other dishes were better, but I just had a terrible experience due to the long wait, our server who forgot about us, and the salty meals. Definitely NOT worth it."

Served on a Toasted Bun with Melted Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayonnaise. And some fabulous Crushed Avocado) and a house salad. The food was great, I am a huge fan! The service was good, though not spectacular. I would definitely recommend that if you get a salad, ask for the house dressing. It's a vinaigrette that is as tasty & interesting as the Strip is spakly & bright! My companions had the Asian Chicken salad, and both gave that two enthusiastic thumbs up!"

We found the space in between a little too dividing so we pushed the tables together.  Why didn't they give us a table big enough for everyone is beyond me (this place is huge so I'm assuming they have a table for 11 somewhere and if they don't, they need to make one like we did). The menu was extensive - very similar to cheesecake factory both in number of dishes offered and the types of dishes offered.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say the two are affiliated.  \n\nThe portions of the food are large! Definitely big enough for two.  So if you don't want left overs or don't want to fall into a food coma, you should definitely share.  So kuddos on the portions.  The service, however, could have been a lot better.  It took almost an hour for us to get our food which is way too long for some pasta and sandwiches - I could cook faster than that at home so I expect your commercial kitchen to do better.  I also thought our server was slow and unattentive.  We hardly saw him and when we did, he would try to just fly by our table - hardly ever checking up on us.  And when we'd ask him for things, he'd take forever to bring it.  Not pleased with the service at all but the food was solid - hence the 3 stars."

You might be able to find less expensive sandwiches on the menu at below $15, but most of the items are above $15. \n\nI decided to go off the beaten path with the Spicy Carnita Sandwich. This is a great sandwich. It's not sloppy as you'd think with the ingredients. Only a little spicy. Wife had the fettuccine alfredo with Shrimp which she did not complain about. \n\nGiven the size, I doubt the wait time would be long.

This means you're going to have tons of variety, a massive menu, and some good free bread.  We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table (a massive rush came in after us).  The space is huge.  There are so many tables in the back area, so the fact that it was full at 4:30-5 p.m. is a good sign.  We had some edamame to start, which was nicely seasoned and came with a great dipping sauce.  I ordered the fried chicken, which came with creamy, delicious mashed potatoes and coleslaw with peanuts.  The whole thing was delicious.  I think I ended up with about 5 pieces of fried chicken, which was a lot, so I was unable to finish it.\n\nA little tip for those going, if you are wanting to conduct business or use your smartphone in the back area where most of the tables are, you're going to have a hard time getting a signal.  This could be good for conversation with family, but potentially difficult if you're trying to conduct business.\n\nI would highly recommend this place.  I was a little nervous going to a sit down place at the Venetian because you never know what the pricing will be, but the Grand Lux Cafe was very reasonable.  My wife and I got drinks, an appetizer, and two full-sized entrees and spent around $40 before tip.  Check it out!"

The waitress we had was rather sluggish, and mundane. A little personality goes a long way. I brushed it off because there were multiple tables she was serving and some of them had annoying little children. \n\nFood: The food was decent. Just what i'd expect from a place like this. Huge portioned, comfort food. I ordered the \"Max\" burger. It is essentially a bacon cheese burger topped with short ribs. It was pretty good, and the cook prepared it just as i asked. Next time i think i'll try something else. I prefer the BBQ bacon Cheeseburger at Cheesecake over this one. \n\nWhile overall a good experience with decent quality food at a reasonable price, i don't see myself going out of my way to come here. I'll probably stop by after a drunken night at TAO, but then again nothing hits the spot like a \"Jacks with a Kicker\" from Terribles."

The only thing that I heard about this place before we went was that it was a spinoff from the creators of The Cheesecake Factory.  I figured it would probably be good.\n\nWe went for breakfast one morning and took our two kids.  My wife opted for the 'Express Breakfast\", aka the buffet.  They had all sorts of fresh fruit, pastries, yogurt, bacon, sausage and breads.  They also had cook to order omlets.  My wife enjoyed it all.  Pretty good for being a buffet.\n\nI ordered the Chilaquiles off of the menu.  I couldn't have made a better choice!  Delicious ranchero sauce, cheese, scrambled eggs, tortilla strips and I'm sure other stuff. All I remember was that it was heaven.  My wife thinks I'm crazy because I kept talking about how good my breakfast was the entire day.  In fact it was so good that we went out of our way to go back the next day for breakfast.\n\nUnfortunately I can't comment on other menu items but the menu was large and varied as others have already mentioned.  Also, the portions are big.\n\nGreat food, I'll be sure to stop by whenever we are somewhere that Grand Lux Cafe is."

In fact, after wandering around the casino one night we even discovered that there are two spread out between both the Venetian and Palazzo hotels. Our experience dining at the Venetian Grand Lux Cafe was overall very good as we were able to get seated right away and the quality of our food was perhaps even better than expected. We began with buffalo chicken egg roll appetizers, which were incredible and highly recommendable as a starter that would also pair well with beer. I decided to order a garlic shrimp pasta dish and my partner in crime ordered a strip steak--both meals that I wouldn't say we order on a regular basis when we go out to eat. Once our food came out, we were very impressed as my pasta tasted incredible and his steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned exquisitely. It actually made me happy that we ended up at Grand Lux Cafe rather than a steakhouse, where he would have definitely paid $50.00 for a steak that would have been similar in quality. \n\nOverall, good service, great food, decent atmosphere, and prices that are better than some of the other more high-end restaurants within the Venetian/Palazzo means that if you find yourself staying at either of these hotels, I would recommend stopping by Grand Lux Cafe. The menu is large enough that if you find yourself in a big party, everyone should be happy eating here. And of course it is centrally located within the casino, which for Las Vegas is another plus."

She rearranged our table and moved our sauce trays only \"a tad to the left\" of the plates, and reached OVER our main dishes to do so. Her sleeves lingered over our drinks and plates; not to mention the fact that as we politely asked for tobacco sauce, she was grabbing it WHILE calling out over her shoulder \"what else was that?\" She described our portion of pasta to be huge, but in reality our probably could feed one person. Hair was on the extra plates we received, and hair was IN the mozzarella of our pizza. Disgusted and disappointed in this service. Especially being around Vegas' variety of restaurants.

It's not the healthiest restaurant choice, but damn is their food good....\n\nI've always like the Cheesecake Factory for really one dish (Shrimp Scampi yay!) and one dish alone, and my initial impression of the Grand Lux Cafe was that they were a bit similar to Cheesecake Factory.  I didn't realize then, that they are owned by the same company...but I digress....\n\nAt the Grand Lux though, I found more dishes that I like (Ahi Tuna burger, Double Stuff Potato Spring Rolls, to name a few).\n\nThis particular location was located right at the base of the set of elevators to the Venetian hotel rooms.  And at the time, being a Venetian guest, it was just way too easy to keep coming back.  Was I mad about that?  Of course not, how can you be mad at good food within walking distance to your elevator bank?\n\nI also appreciated their long hours.  I guess being a Vegas location and all, it was easy for them to open early (early enough for me) and stay open later.\n\nBut I guess do to the close proximity to the elevators and their long hours, they do get full fast.  Full enough to cause 2 long lines...which I never quite understood why there were 2 lines to begin with.  If you don't mind taking the food to go (which is the easiest thing to do when the line is too long) head over to the left area which kind of looks like a cafe.  You can order Grand Lux takeout from there."

On this trip, we caught a late dinner here post-Blue Man Group...\n\nLocation-wise, the \"patio'd\" dining area of Grand Lux has a great view for people watching, looking out upon the escalator landing that meets the casino floor to the parking structure and shopping center.  And the people watching here is excellent... the sexy, the desperate, the suave, the chic, the buffoonery!\n\nThe interior/exterior is inline with the vibe and feel of the Venetian, simple-chic , with notable designerly touches of old-country influence and theme .  \n\nGrand Lux is by no means a fancy-shmancy bistro.  It is, in essence and actuality, a well-dressed upscale Cheesecake Factory affiliated establishment.  And for the intent and perspective of casual ambiance, generous portions, affordable dining, it's well suited...\n\nThe puree'd Butternut Squash and ginger soup was a great start to the late night meal; delicately sweet with a subtle tartness.  Only one person had ordered it, but it was so good, she insisted on passing it around amongst the five of us.  It was that good...\n\nI had the Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich;  sharable serving of four triangular flatbread sandwiches set atop a platter of fries.  A smokey-spiciness from the chicken and the pepperjack cheese is offset by a cool avocado-corn salsa.  I ate half and saved the other have for breakfast.  Also around the table was the chili-cheese topped jumbo Kobe Hotdog (w/fries), the Braised Pot Roast dinner, and the Chicken Royale (w/ white wine butter sauce)... everything tasted good (the cool thing about foodies, if they've got something good, they like to share!) \n\nOur bill for the food (sans drinks)?  Just north of $60.\n\nIt's one of the better (if not one of the best!) casual after-midnight menus on the strip... with the bonus of watching an entertaining  parade of people."

We went to the Venetian location mainly cause we could not find the location to the palazzo one where we were staying. \n\nThe wait time to be seated was non, however to get service it too a little while, especially to get drinks. Our server was semi nice. However, here are why this establishment received two stars:\n\n1.  The food took over an hour to get out, the restaurant was not busy nor did we order complex dishes. (6 people total in group)\n\n2. Refills on water and drinks took a while \n\n3. The food was just okay! Way bellow Cheesecake Factory standards for a place that's suppose to be more upscale. \n\nOverall, don't go here if you are looking for quick service and great food. There are other places to go for similar prices both at the palazzo and Venetian. My top is to go to Bellagio or Paris where they have restaurants with great views, after all you can always go to a suburb near you and get Cheesecake Factory type food but you can't get world class entertainment and quality there."

            "review": "I checked out the Grand Lux Cafe twice during my weeklong stay in LV. I went the first time because it was near my hotel and was relatively affordable. I went the second time because the first meal was that good.\n\nThe GLC gives off the vibe of an upscale diner. It has a large and diverse menu, which covers all sorts of different options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's also open 24 hours. The price point is really reasonable for LV - anywhere from $10-$20 for the average meal. The server also told me that the pasta portions are gigantic, though I didn't have pasta when I was there.\n\nThe first time I went to GLC was on a weeknight. It wasn't busy, and I got a table immediately. I ordered the Grand Lux Burger Melt with fries, which was quite delicious. The burger was cooked very well. The fries were a little soggy, but not too bad. The portion size was reasonable for the cost. They also give you bread as you're waiting for your meal, and the bread was freshly baked and warm, which I appreciated.\n\nThe second time I went to the GLC was on a Friday for lunch. The place was packed with a line out of the restaurant. However, the line moved fairly quickly, and I got a table within ten minutes of getting in line.\n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles, and let me tell you, that was outstanding. Huge waffle. Really flavorful and moist chicken. The Pecan Honey-Butter Sauce was delicious, and the waffle itself was covered in pecans to add some texture that I enjoyed. It was also very reasonably priced for lunch fare.\n\nWhy am I not giving this a five star rating?\n\nSimply, the wait time from the order to having the meal served was too long. On Tuesday, I waited at least 1/2 an hour to get the burger, and on Friday, it took even longer than that. If it's busy, I can understand that. The size of their menu, which is quite massive and diverse, certainly adds additional challenges. However, the place was dead on weeknight and I still waited too long. That knocks it down a bit.\n\nOtherwise, I'd definitely recommend it."

Decent, but the experience and food quality reminds me a lot of the Cheesecake Factory (who also own the Grand Lux). \n\nThey serve your usual rote of bland (or over-salted) American standards: pastas, giant burgers, monstrous breakfasts. On one meal, my husband's Grand Lux Burger was relatively dry, I enjoyed the Shortrib Grilled Cheese, which made for good hangover food, but really nothing to write home about. During another meal I had the corned beef hash, which was nice -- not your typical Denny's canned fare, but the over-easy eggs that I'd ordered were slightly overcooked.\n\nIt's relatively inexpensive sit-down fare (by Vegas standards, anyway) - not bad if you want to grab a fairly quick bite in between gambling runs and don't feel like leaving the hotel or patronizing the food court."

We came because when we tried it several years ago, it was pretty good. boy, has it changed over the years, and only for the worse. \n\nFrom what I remember, we ordered the chicken pot pie, pasta telephono, and chicken Alfredo. Though I don't remember what the other two ordered, I do remember that all of us left that place unsatisfied and quite disappointed. --Chicken pot pie had a great flaky crust, but the filling was boring, bland, and watery. \n-Pasta telephono was extremely cheesy (too much for my taste) and had an extremely weird and unexplainable taste. Definitely not recommended. \n-Chicken Alfredo was just an average chicken Alfredo, nothing exciting.\n\nService was pretty average and the place was decently crowded, considering the fact that it was a pretty big place. We dined at around 8 on a Tuesday night. But overall, this place was a last minute decision for us since it was located in our hotel and we are definitely not coming back. my advice: don't bother wasting a night here; try mon ami gabi at the Paris hotel, it has excellent food!"

It is Vegas after all but that's not the point here. We had to wait awhile before being seated where there were maybe 3 other occupied tables in our section so I wouldnt say it was busy by any means. Our waitress her name escapes me. Sorry, late night!! But she was AWESOME!! Seriously 11 drunktards and she was hekka cheery chatting mith us, taking orders, making suggestions, playing with Ben ,etc. I cant remembered what everyone ordered but I don't think anyone was too impressed with the food, nothing stood out and a few people had to change their orders for they ran out of some things. I on the other hand always order my good ole Vegas stand by bagel & lox, well you cant really mess that up too much now can you?? So in summation basically if there is nothing else open, you dont feel like walking, and the elevator to your suite is right next to this place I would definitely go again!"

I had the avocado chipotle burger. Burger was cooked to perfection, tasted gourmet fresh. Avocado portions were fair, fries on the side and you are golden! For lunch, my friend had the chilaquiles (delicious, but light on the eggs) and strawberry waffles\n\nBetter than Cheesecake Factory!"

I've been here a couple of times with a party of four or greater - of course here on business. It's pretty relaxing considering how crowded it can be. During my visit, the wait staff was very attentive, kept our water filled at all times. And kept on bringing warm bread. \n\nOne thing I found interesting is how they broadcast their recent health and safety inspection - a wall dedicated to letter A's. It's actually quite nice. \n\n\nFood was pretty good considering the cost, and I must say, wait times on food is exceptional considering the crowd. During a tradeshow evening, this place was jammed packed - and we got our food in about 15 minutes. Very quick considering the crowd. \n\nI had the Spaghetti with Clams and Shrimp. Good portions of food - although, I would've preferred less Clams and Shrimp. It seemed a bit much. \n\nI also tried the Keylime pie - it was much larger than I expected - so, consider that a warning for those who have a desire with dessert. \n\nIf your crew isn't sure of what to eat, then bring them here - a relaxing atmosphere, where there something for everyone to eat."

I don't think I have ever had any crab cakes that are that good, even my aunties agreed--saying that they weren't even that hungry to begin with.\n\nI decided to order the ahi ceviche as my main entree.  It was very refreshing & filling, yet not heavy at all.  Although, it got really sour towards the bottom because the lime juice must have all sunken to the bottom of the serving glass.\n\nAuntie Ann had the salmon & lox and that wasn't too bad either.  Although, the salmon was a tad on the salty side...but still tasty nonetheless.\n\nAuntie Bev went with the deep fried calamari as her main dish and we all thought that was very well executed as well.  The batter was crispy and fried to a golden perfection.  It had a few deep fried bay shrimps and veggies as well.\n\nWe ended our meal by sharing a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was divine...considering we claimed we weren't too hungry yet ate everything and still had room for dessert.  My virgin pi\u00f1a colada was excellent as well.  \n\nOverall, I love the food, and service was excellent.  The fact that they're open 24 hours is a big bonus!

There is only 1 place open for dinner in the Venetian after 10pm throughout the week, yup, this is the place.  \n\nThe portions were great, we had a salad and an appetizer, that's all I remember.  It was late, we were hungry and had a little to drink.  We split everything and were perfectly content.  Personally, get a booth in the back."

Service was amazing as well. Attentive and friendly. However, we got a too friendly waitress once and her accent was really heavy, my sisters and I nicknamed her Helga since she didn't tell us her name...\n\nTheir fresh bread basket is amazing, it's not just bread, it's freakin AMAZING bread. their salads are HUGE, the pasta salad combos are a great deal and the omlettes,...make sure you are hungry when you order that baby. \n\nthe atmosphere is welcoming and perfect for a quick eat after a night out or marathon gambling. Dont want to dine in? they also have a cafe outside for a quick to-go kinda thing."

I was hoping to dine somewhere a bit more high end - but thems the breaks in Vegas. The cash tends to ebb and flow. Or in my case, just ebb. \n\nThat brings me to Grand Lux. A good meal, with awesome portions at the right price. Yanette M (partner in crime) and I started with the seared ahi. We both loved it, and she's not a fan of raw fish. The wasabi cream was worthy of plate licking. I probably would've done it if we weren't seated on the \"patio\". For entrees, she went with the Cedar Planked BBQ salmon. Holy crap that was a huge portion. Tons of veggies, mashed taters, and onion rings. I took some nibbles from her plate and everything was very well done. I went with the pasta carbonara and side ceasar. The carbonara was delish. Done with applewood smoked bacon as opposed to pancetta. It was fab - but really you can't go wrong with bacon and a butter cream sauce. Just sayin. The salad was good and nice to look at, but a pain to eat. Once you coat romaine spears with dressing, they tend to slide around on the plate while you're trying to cut it. I'm a lazy eater. It's why I don't order crab legs. We each had a glass of wine with lunch. \n\nOverall, everything was really good. Service included. Except that it took way too long to get our app. I mean, 20 mins for seared ahi? That's not even cooked really. Also, the place wasn't crowded at the time - so what gives? Check came out to about $50 before tip. Definitely worth it."

The wait staff and hosts couldn't have been friendlier, and though it was a busy night, we didn't feel rushed or have to wait long for a table. Unlike many restaurants on the strip that had a price fix menu, the Grand Lux Cafe stayed with it's original menu and made our new years eve dinner memorable, affordable and delicious. I would definitely recommend it. Gave it 4 out 5 stars, only because it's a chain restaurant."

Let me tell you, the service has a lot to do with it. \n\nFirst trip was during a late dinner after arriving at the Venetian. Menu was HUGE, as in Cheesecake Factory-esque HUGE. My fab buddies shared their Asian nachos which we all swooned over. My shrinking beef was a bit of a disappointment in that it was mostly onions and green onions rather than beef. What saved this dinner for me was our server Julian. Even through the drunken antics of the guys, he was gracious and continued to serve our party extremely well.\n\nWord of advice: Skip the \"breakfast buffet\" Totally not worth the $16-something price on it. Not enough selections and the quality was mediocre at best. I was really disappointed with it. Just order from the regular breakfast menu."

Me and my friends came here at 2am-ish friday night (or saturday morning i should say) after a long drunken night out. I really like that it's open all the time, that its right next to the elevators up to the rooms and that we didn't have to wait very long for seating. We ordered the calamari, some kind of sandwich and spinach artichoke dip. The calamari tasted soooo gooood, spinach artichoke dip was really good, and I dont remember much about the sandwich but I'm sure it was fine. \n\nWe came here saturday night too, also after a long night out. This time we came with 12 girls so we had to wait a little longer for seating but it was still pretty fast (also probably because it was 2-3am in the morning). Our table split chicken and waffles, calamari (yes again because it was so good) , some kind of pizza and some other dish with egg or something but I didn't get to try it. Everything was pretty good from what I can remember. I think we ordered maybe 7 dishes in total and the bill came out to 100 something dollars.\n\nIf you do go there, I'd say get calamari for sure because its really delicious (cant go wrong with fried stuff). Spinach artichoke dip was also really good but I think its usually good no matter where you get it. Chicken and waffle (one big waffle) were just eh. Grand Lux is affiliated with cheesecake factory and I can see why, it really does remind me of a more expensive cheesecake factory. But still, if youre staying at the venetian, its a great convenient place to go after a night out."

It's a branch of Cheesecake Factory, and I really enjoy Cheesecake Factory because of it's wide selection of difference foods on the menu. Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 is about the same. It has a similar menu and prices.  At the Venetian, I believe it's opened 24-hours as well, and the wait was pretty short both times. Service is decent. The first time I had The Max Burger (Our Greatest Hamburger Creation! Certified Angus Beef Topped with Cheddar Cheese, Crisp Applewood Smoked Bacon, Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Roasted Short Ribs. Served with Fries), which had angus beef and short rib with cheese. You can't really taste the short rib, so it doesn't add much to the dish, but the overall the burger was satisfying and hit the spot! The fries were however a totally different story. It wasn't good at all, it didn't feel fresh, the tasted as though they didn't use fresh oil, and the frying was off. The second day I had the lunch plate jambalaya. I was kind of craving it. Not a good idea when you're eating at 3 and going to eat at a buffet at 7. Well the lunch is a decent size. The chicken isn't so good for jambalaya, but that's a given, it doesn't give meaty flavors to the dish. It also lacked sausages! Anyways, the dish was okay, not great, the burger was still fresh in my mind. Actually come to think of it, I'd more so give this place a 3.6, maybe given I was in Vegas made the food taste better and overlook the blunders of the food."

My review is on their breakfast buffet.  Its not as huge as your casino buffets but the food is higher quality and simply awesome!  There is an egg/omlete station....the omletes are soooooo yummy.  They have bacon, hash browns, sausage links and as of this year now have ham.  There is sour dough bread, english muffins and bagels which you can toast.  The fruit is much fresher than in your traditional buffets.  My only somewhat of a complaint is the pastry selection needs an little makeover.  They have had the same selection for years now and it gets a bit boring.  Oh and also as of this year they have belgium waffles which were great!!!....the chocolate chips to sprinkle on made them super good!  Another plus is you get ALL the beverages you want included in the price.  I know this is relatively standard in buffets but where do you get FRESH SQUEEZED orange juice?  NO ONE has orange juice like the Grand Lux!!!  \nIf you are debating whether to go to the Grand Lux in the Palazzo or Venetian I say definetly the Venetian....while the one in Palazzo is quite pretty inside there is something about the Venetian that really stands out and makes it my fav!"

Don't think they know the meaning of medium done. I didn't complain, just ate it. I also didn't care for the sauce on the burger. The fries were good. The waiter was fine. 2 stars because of that."

The first time I ate here was this past summer, on a not so busy Sunday late afternoon. We were seated quickly but took 1.5 hours for our food to come! When asked what the delay was, management actually came out, apologized and said my friend's sandwich had to be remade because it was dropped on the ground. Fine. \nAs for yesterday, we also came for brunch and were a group of 6, we were seated right away because it wasn't so busy. Great because we were starving. Our waitress took 30 minutes to come and introduce herself, and disappeared for a long while-- we had to ask other staff if we could please put in our order (we were starving). She finally took our order, but later on came out to tell us she would be leaving and we would have another server. After 1 hour of waiting for our food to come (and not seeing our new waitress since the switch) we noticed that we were never even given the complimentary bread that all the other tables received. We asked another server (not ours, she was still missing) if we could have bread and by that time our server was coming out with our orders, which were ALL COLD.\nThe food is great at this place-- I've had the fried chicken strips and waffles, and the corned beef hash-- I hate to give it a poor review, since the chefs and cooks seem to have it on point! But man is the service bad."

If you're in Vegas ( obviously) and in the venetian, we stayed at the palazzo so we wandered by here quite often. We got horribly lost ( OK it was me SHH don't tell my wife I said that I'll never hear the end of it.) So this was always around, if you can't get out of the casino to eat due to lack of time or inability to find the door then this is a good albeit expensive alternative. Personally Vegas has a ton of great places to eat try not to stay inside the strip casinos. Be adventurous strike out see what else there is to see & eat."

The margharita pizza was also pretty thick for a pizza I expected to be more thin crust. Both do not stand well for consumption the next morning. Whoopie pie was okay, though the cream in the middle was very heavy on the frosting.\n\nPortions indeed are huge. I probably would've been fine eating just the calamari appetizer without getting the pizza. Order was ready 20 minutes, so not too long of a wait.

Back to the food, WOAH those were some awesome waffles! I originally wanted chicken & waffles but they ran out of fried chicken (sad face) but I was definitely satisfied with their waffles & strawberries. Their serving was pretty big and the waffle itself tasted soooo yummy and fluffy. I'm usually very picky when it comes to waffles because ever since the first time I tasted authentic Belgian waffles as a kid I've yet to find anything close to it... I don't think Grand Lux's was close BUT it definitely was delicious. Have I mentioned the size of their menu!?? I guess it's because Grand Lux Cafe is related to The Cheesecake Factory. I've tasted one of my friends' slider and I was impressed at the consistency of their food. At other places, some of their dishes are hit or miss but after tasting my friends food, all tasting very good, there's a good chance that whatever you order here will be delicious.

Quick, no nonsense, and always there for a refill, question, or helpful advice- LINDA C. was THE BEST server I have had in a really long while, and (if you didn't notice) I'm very critical when it comes to service. Not only was I a restaurant trainer, but moreso- I was a BOH trainer, and anybody in the industry knows- there's an unspoken line between Front of the House and Back of the House.

Went to the one in Houston several times and fell in love with it (except the high-ceilinged bus station design and corresponding noise level), so was glad to find they opened one in the Venetian...and then opened one in Palazzo next door soon after. Kind of weird to have the only two GLC's in Vegas so close to one another, but they don't seem to suffer for customers, so that's a good sign. I'm reviewing the Venetian one because we've been there more, but both locations are equally good.\n\nI agree with the majority of the reviewers here- the menu is huge and caters to every taste (even vegetarians - and vegans - three items, I think), the portions are large and the specialty drinks are quite good. My favorite items are the chicken piccata, wiener schnitzel and Thai chicken pizza...even when here for brunch, actually. A couple of items are similar to the Cheesecake Factory (southwestern salad, Asian chicken salad, jambalaya, chicken parmesan) but are presented in a more upscale manner and larger portion size. What is definitely different from the Cheesecake Factory is the dessert tray- the beignets, peach cobbler, bread pudding, various decadent chocolate delights and fruit tarts are definitely tempting, but five types of cheesecake are also served here for \"traditionalists...\"\n\nAs a Vegas local, I'm always on alert on the Strip for the all-too-common management vibe that says \"We cater to tourists- and can cut corners because we know most won't be back no matter how good the service is.\" We come back here so often (both locations, but primarily the Venetian) because never has waitstaff ever seemed like they were anything but glad to serve. Sometimes there can be a backlog of orders and/or customers and things get delayed, but our server has always come over to apologize, give updates and the occasional extra bread basket, etc. \n\nFour stars rather than five because the prices for some items are indeed higher than other comparable restaurants on and off the Strip, and the wait can sometimes be 30-40 minutes...sometimes at times you'd expect (weekend evenings and Fridays) and other times you might not (a Tuesday evening in December, a Monday morning in July...) But if the wait at this location is too long any given day, it's a 10-minute walk to the other one in the Palazzo where the wait might be shorter...and vice versa."

Most 24 hour places aren't as nice as this one. \n\nWe came here during dinner time though, not during the wee hours of the morning. And the place was fairly busy but since we had reservations we didn't have to wait very long. \n\nThe server was extremely friendly to us considering we had a big group (my family and I). She took our drink orders down and carded almost all of us minus the parentals. She even carded my oldest brother who is waaaay above the drinking age. I guess he just looks that young. \n\nI ordered the Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich. It came with french fries. It wasn't that bad actually. But it wasn't my favorite. It was pretty greasy but I guess most sandwiches with a name like that tends to be on the greasier side.\n\nMy brother ordered the Crispy Caramel Chicken and it was so so good. He let me try some and immediately I wanted to trade with him. It was so delicious. The sauce is sweet but not too sweet that it tastes like dessert. The chicken was crispy enough but not too much that it's hard to bite into. Oh man, I wish I had some right now!\n\nThe drinks were pretty strong and come in big glasses. \n\nThe service was awesome. Our server was so nice and friendly and joked with us. Very accommodating too!\n\nWe love coming to this place. So we'll definitely be back on our next trip!"

We made our own omelettes with the list of toppings (max of 4), as well ordered the chorizo and cheese omelette, fresh garden omelette, and the crab & asparagus omelette.\n\nThe chorizo and cheese was bursting with flavor but a little too oily/greasy for me - especially for breakfast.

Definitely a nice kick-start to the morning! \n\nCrab & Asparagus omelette - tasty, but a bit of a waste. The tomatoes, asparagus, and cheese were simple and awesomeee together. Unfortunately, they overshadowed any presence of crab. Sure, you could see the little crab meat pieces, but the expected seafood-y sweetness that comes from crab was buried under the other flavors in the omelette.\n\nAll the omelettes came with a generous side of toast + jam/butter! \n\nDef recommend for a hearty and fresh breakfast!"

She also told us if she found that the kid moves around she would need to ask us to leave the place. Which toddler sits in one place the whole time?? I told her we had already waited quite a bit and that my son was already hungry. She looked like she couldn't care less.In any case, she said the reason was that she couldn't service any other place but we noticed that there were tables being served all the way at the back.

Not only is the food scrumptious, but the menu is as large as the average American.  It's causal, flexible, and you can have whatever you like, however you like it, whenever you like it.  Poached eggs and a burger at 2AM?  The Grand Lux can make it happen.\n\nThe food at the Venetian location tastes noticeably better.  We had the Manhattan salad here once and the shrimp came juicy and grilled (which wasn't the case at the Palazzo location). My recommendations include the sliders, the miso salmon, the grilled veggie pizza, Chipotle avocado burger, the spaghettini with clams, and the calamari.  The calamari merits its own sentence--we're talking squid, rock shrimp (think mini shrimp tempura), zucchinis, and onions.  For the price, it's basically the best calamari you'll ever get.\n\nNow, the Palazzo location has better desserts (the dessert menu is almost entirely different).  I highly recommend the molten chocolate cake (see my pictures and you'll know what I mean).  The Palazzo location, at least during the afternoon, also had a smaller menu listing mini appetizers (around $5 or so).  We tried the haystack which was similar to the regular calamari appetizer, but stripped of the seafood--just onion strings and zucchini slices.  The result? A vegetarian delight and now one of my new favorite fried appetizers to get!  We went to the Venetian Grand Lux the next day hoping to order the same thing, but alas, no mini appetizers there."

Note: the one at the Palazzo does close around 2/3 am..(and why do the connected casinos need 2 Grand Lux's on each end again?)\n\nIf a breakfast buffet is what you're craving, this Grand Lux lays out a hearty display of hot and cold breakfast items + beverage for a reasonable $16.50 (served until 11 weekdays, 12:30 weekends) \n\nThough we were here during brunch hours and both the bf and I love breakfast foods, we wanted a filling lunch. I had the Pasta Carbonara lunch combo, and opted for the fresh organic side salad with ranch dressing IN A GRAVY BOAT! I've always been hesitant ordering Pasta Carbonara, afraid the overall taste of the dish will come out too sweet, but Grand Lux did their Pasta Carbonara right! It was so savory.. but not overly salty, and a hint of sweet from the bacon. I was in love with this ginormous entree!\n\nI've always heard the Grand Lux described as an upgraded Cheesecake Factory, so I was expecting higher prices. Surprisingly, the sister restaurant chains have comparable, if not identical, pricing schemes.\n\nService here was top-notch! I don't remember our waitress' name, but she made us feel so comfortable. She came like every 5 minutes, but was the complete opposite from intrusive. She also kept apologizing for the wait (what wait? we didn't even notice that the food was taking longer than usual), and letting us know our food would be out soon. The manager even came to our table on a separate occasion, and apologized more for our food delay. \n\nThere are so many great dining options along the Strip, with Grand Lux being one of them. Though realistically, I will not be eating here every time I visit Vegas, this is now one of spots on the top of my list!"

The price is very reasonable and includes beverages. Service was good, but my friends who ordered from the menu seemed to have waited a bit long for their food, needless to say their food was great also!"

The prices were reasonable (for Vegas) and the service was some of the best I experienced on my trip.\n\nTypical of Vegas, they served me way too much food and I couldn't even come close to finishing.  I also upgraded to a large beer, which was a mistake when I couldn't finish.  Oh well.\n\nThis place is run by the same folks who run the Cheesecake Factory, and I the food was basically along the same lines.  The ambiance was fantastic tho; people watching at the Venetian is a wonderful way to spend an hour munching on pasta."

I always get the chipotle avocado burger. its one of my favorite burgers in town. My dad always gets the turkey burger and he loves it. By brother had the Chicken Royale and was impressed. The size of the meals are really good too. if you aren't that hungry you could easily share your entree or take it home and have a nice lunch the next day. The Asian Nachos are not to be missed! They are out of this world! It comes with a wasabi cream which I don't care for but every server but one reminds us of this and ask if we would like it on the side. \n\nThe space is very large but you wouldn't know it looking at it from the casino floor. There is tons of seating and we've never had to wait more than a few minutes. The servers are great and always make sure we have what we need. The one thing that drives me crazy about this place is they don't serve lunch until 11:00 but are open 24 hours. I don't care for breakfast and we had to wait 15 minutes for our server to put in order.\n\nAll in all the positives out way the negative. Its a great restaurant with great food and service. If you give it a try you won't be disappointed."

Prices were fantastic for being Las Vegas and more accustomed to what we are used to back home. Service was wonderful and great customers service. Instead of the traditional crayons and coloring for kids they gave these wax strips in multiple colors that kids could create objects with. Super cool and totally different fro. Any other restaurant. Our waiter gave us a few packets to take home as well. \n\nWe had to wait about 20 minutes for the food to come to our table but thinking about how big the menu is and the amount of people in the restaurant I can't really complain. It was not that bad. The proportions for the food are HUGE. So much food for the price. \n\nIf you are in the area and need a great meal for a fantastic price don't hesitate to try the Grand Luxe."

I wanted to die, each bite was filled with potato-ey, cheesy, crunchy goodness. \n\nHubby ordered the shrimp scampi ($20) and I got the Sunday night pasta (~$16).

They offer a breakfast buffet so I cruised through it but was not impressed so we all ordered a la cart. I was HUNGRY so I ordered bacon and eggs AND blueberry pancakes. It was good, bacon was crispy, eggs were cooked just right, hash-browns were nice and crispy. I like the big plump blueberries in the panckage. My husband had the chicken and waffles. That waffle was the BEST waffle EVER! I ended up eating his. My friends got the salmon platter and breakfast sandwich. The salmon/lox were really really good. The sandwich was big and my friend was only able to eat half. Overall it was a good breakfast but I would definitely get a waffle next time. Service was ok, they were busy.

            "review": "For years, the Grand Lux was the best 24 hour coffee shop in Vegas in my opinion.  I don't know if that's true now, places like Central at Caesars are certainly giving it a run for its money, as casinos are investing more thought and money into these 24 hour joints.  But, Grand Lux is certainly an excellent place to eat any time of day, and you'd be hard pressed to find better food in the middle of the night.\n\nThe menu is expansive, which is not surprising given that it's owned by the Cheesecake Factory folks.  Most sandwiches are a good bet in my experience; the club is a favorite of more than one visitor I've taken to Grand Lux.  The fries are good, but they are rarely seasoned.  The buffalo chicken spring rolls are a favorite of mine, whenever we get appetizers they get my vote.  They are made like traditional spring rolls, but with the buffalo and blue cheese flavor wing fans will like.  The Grand Lux Burger Melt is another menu item I've ordered more than once.  Served on grilled parmesan bread, it's a play on a patty melt.  Certainly not appropriate if you're looking for a light meal, but it's a great burger.\n\nMore than once, I've had the breakfast buffet in the morning.  It's very simple:  pastries, fruits, eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes, etc.  But, it's all fresh and hot, and they make omelets or hash browns to order.  I prefer my hash browns extra crispy, so they made some and brought it to the table.  Since Venetian doesn't have a buffet, this is a nice option in the morning.\n\nFinally, I love the strawberry lemonade, but it's too sweet.  I get it without the sugar lining the rim, and that does the trick for me.\n\nService can be spotty during peak hours, but I've never had any major issues."

It would take me a good 5 minutes to read everything and decide what I want but the first time we came here, we ordered from their take out area, and the second time I came here, we just ordered desserts.

I was more interested in the complimentary white and wheat breads to cure my hangover and fill my empty belly. \n\nThe lady at the table next to use ordered Grand Lux's pot pie and the pot pie was bigger than her head. It was MASSIVE! I laughed when she tried to eat it. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely paying a visit to the Grand Lux Cafe. And did you know there's one over in the Palazzo too? Because I sure didn't. We trekked over from the Palazzo to eat at the one in the Venetian -- hahaha . . ."

I ordered the Monte Cristo Sandwich then.  This was one of the best I've tasted and not every place I've had one knows how to make it. There are only two places I recommend for a Monte Cristo and that's Disneyland French Quarters and now the Grand Lux. If you haven't tried it, you're missing out.

During my time here in Las Vegas I decided to eat here with a friend as one of my birthday dinner stops.  As far as drinks are concerned, my friend ordered a mojito while I ordered a blood orange mimosa.  For our entree we ordered a Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya in addition to BBQ glazed salmon.  As usual the food was delicious and what I would expect out of a restaurant of such nature.  If you like the Cheesecake Factory then you'll LOVE the Grand Lux.

They were just putting away the breakfast buffet, so seeing that I decided to order from their all day breakfast menu. My husband is a chef, formerly at a hotel, and warned me that it would probably be the worst time of day to be ordering a breakfast since the cooks are winding down from making breakfast probably since about 5AM. Stupidly, I ignored him and ordered it anyway.\n\nI ordered the eggs anyway meal: two eggs, hash browns, bacon, and sourdough toast. Everything was bland and overcooked. My bacon was burnt and flavorless, the hash browns were dry, and my eggs tasted like rubber, and my toast was cold. I would have complained to my server if I could have found her. Unfortunately after a few minutes my hunger got the best of me and I ate the crap anyhow.\n\nMy husband's vegetable soup was not any better. He found several vegetable ends in his small cup, and TWO bay leaves. I'd hate to think how many bay leaves the stock pot had in it if two ended up in his tiny cup.\n\nAnd as I intimated before, our service was AWFUL. We ordered at 11:40 and didn't receive our food until 12:15. And our server was nowhere to be found in the interim. I think she just waited in the kitchen until her orders were up, delivered them and went straight back to the kitchen to wait again instead of checking up on her tables.\n\nThe food and the service were terrible, which is a shame since when we initially arrived I thought to myself that I wanted to get up earlier the next day to get their breakfast buffet.

There are beautiful interior features and rooms, a fabulous casino and a lot of places to dine at. There is something for everyone, from high end restaurants to snack bars. To each his own and I'm sure that even the most demanding diner will enjoy one of the restaurants. For me, I love coming to the Grand Lux Cafe because it has an upscale feel to it without the pricey menus. The fare is reasonable for resort dining and it's a very comfy atmosphere. \n\nI came here for dinner on this particular evening and we were seated promptly. Upon being seated, the waitress took our drink orders, customary green bottle and water with a lemon wedge. A basket with fresh baked bread was also served. Next we proceeded to decide on what appetizer to have. We agreed on this creation called a Double Stuffed Potato Spring Roll. Let me tell you, it's awesome! Imagine a lumpia wrapper with mashed potatoes in it, served halved, crispy with melted cheese and topped with green onions, applewood bacon and a sour cream dipping sauce... I was absolutely in appetizer heaven! Probably not something you can partake in everyday, but a must when you are on vacay and enjoying dining out!  For dinner, I settled on the Ribeye and my dining companion had the Shrimp Scampi served on a bed of Pasta... I ordered the Ribeye medium rare, and that's the way I got it! Now that made me a happy diner. Now, it's not easy to prepare a Ribeye because you can't see it cooking inside, but they do a great job here. I was impressed because it wasn't a thick piece and the thinner they are, the harder they are to prepare. I glanced over at my dining companion and saw that she was happily enjoying her Scampi. There were lot's of generous sized shrimp and the pasta looked delicious! We enjoyed our dinner here and as for dessert, well, there wasn't any room left! Definitely a favorite whenever in Vegas, I shall return next trip!"

The place is huge so can accommodate many people, especially large parties.  The menu has a large variety- burgers, salads, pasta, steak, Chinese, Mexican etc.- it would be a safe bet for diverse palates. The prices are medium, what you would expect at a diner-ish restaurant at Vegas.  The service is pretty decent too, but it's definitely a hit or miss.  I've came here at 3am before and my server took FOREVER doing everything or is no where to be found.  I've also came here at 8pm and they were fully staffed with multiple people attending to us and filling out water.\n\nPro:\nOpened 24 hours! \n\nCon:\nAlways have at least 15 min wait to be seated"

It was very tasty and not dry. The fries were crispy with a nice soft center. The waiter was nice and brought me my requested array of fry condiments. My wife had the chicken salad sandwich and it was tasty as well. Not too inundated with mayo. A good place for sure. Sad we missed their brunch buffet - next time."

Luckily there are great places like Grand Lux Cafe that will spare you some time.  There is one inside The Pallazo and another inside The Venetian.  \n\nThe first time I came to Grand Lux I had one of their chicken sandwiches with fries, about $13.  Its fairly big and pacts quite a punch.  I was stuffed for hours and even had to nap shortly after.  This last time I tried the burger melt, about $13.50, which also comes with fries.    The burger melt oozed from side to side with hot melted cheese and thousand island.  Every bite tasted just, if not better, than the last.  I highly recommend the burger melt if you're interested in a burger.  I got mine medium rare and it was delicious. \n\nService was pretty fast and efficient.

It was too late for a full lunch and I didn't want to fill up as I knew my friends and I were going have a big dinner in Chinatown. This place seems pretty crowded no matter what time of the morning, day, or night it is and there's usually a bit of a line to get in. Luckily for us we only had to wait a few minutes since it was kind of getting toward the end of the lunch hours.\n\nI must say this is a pretty nice place....nice trendy looking cafe....dimly lit....with lots of table or booth seating. Immediately after being seated, our server came over to greet us and took our drinks order....nice and friendly guy. It didn't take long to decide what I wanted and I knew the portions would be pretty large, so my friend and I decided to split a chicken salad sandwich with fries. Not bad.....had pretty much all the fixins' and the fries were hot and fresh....my only complaint would probably be that it could've had more chicken salad filling in it.\n\nWe came back here again two days later for their breakfast. Before I flew out to Vegas, my brother had given me a couple of Costco coupons for either a free continental breakfast or the grand lux breakfast buffet for just $11+ (Usual price about $19+). Of course we went ahead and chose the breakfast buffet! It wasn't a huge spread, but good enough for a very filling breakfast....lots of fresh fruit. yoghurt, pastries, breads, a couple of hot food stations with hash browns, sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, and waffles.....and there's an egg station for eggs made to order.....nice touch :) Drinks are ordered from the server separately, and OH WoW......the OJ is freshly squeezed and amazingly refreshing! For what you get for the grand lux breakfast buffet, it's well worth the regular $19+.....and is just an absolute deal at $11+! Yum!.....Very good breakfast!\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive with pretty much all you need to satisfy any kind of 24/7.craving."

My boyfriend asked around to see what restaurant had calamari and a couple people directed us here. \n\nWe were seated very quickly and given water and bread right away. I already knew I wanted calamari, so we ordered that once we were seated. \n\nIt took us a while to decide what we wanted since the menu had a big variety. I guess that's why the website says \"something for everyone!\" So true!\n\nWe finally decided upon the Crispy Caramel Chicken because it just sounded so good! \"Crispy Battered Pieces of Chicken Breast in a Spicy Thai Caramel Sauce with Mushrooms, Onions, Red Chile Peppers, Garlic and Ginger. Served with Rice.\"\n\nThe calamari came and it wasn't just calamari. It also came with Rock Shrimp, Zucchini and Onions. Served with a couple dipping sauces. It was all so crunchy, just the way I like it! I loved that they added in the shrimp, zucchini, and onions. It made it all the more better!\n\nThe caramel chicken came and we were ecstatic! IT looked just as it was described in the menu, maybe even better! Our first bites had us melting in our seats, it was so tasty! The chicken was breaded perfectly and the Thai sauce was just delicious! It didn't have too much ginger either, which is a surprise since a lot of dishes with ginger tend to have chunks of it. \n\nAll in all, perfect experience! The portion was perfect to share, we didnt even finish, so we had some yummy leftovers the next day :)"

We noticed right away that they had a private dining room that had a podium and audio visual capabilities.  We decided in June to have an August wedding, and decided on the Grand Lux after discovering that their banquet prices were the most reasonable out of all the Las Vegas Strip options.  Yes, it's an upscale Cheesecake Factory.  I happen to enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.\n\nI sent an inquiry email to the restaurant and received a phone response less than two hours later from Rich, the Events Manager.  He promptly emailed me a list of dinner options along with prices.  Even with the \"plus plus'-es (tip, gratuity, etc.), the per person costs did not break the bank!  Rich also provided his favorite meal options as well as the ones that his customers enjoyed the most.  For the record, we settled on the Filet Mignon ($10 extra), Miso Salmon, Madera Chicken, and Pasta Fresca (for the vegetarians).\n\nWe met with Rich and his banquet staff two days prior to our reception, where we handed off our wedding favors and gave instructions.  Rich had our printed menus with meal selections and it looked fabulous.  We decided against bringing our own centerpieces since it was a destination wedding, so they agreed to put flameless votives on the tables.  We were already impressed with their hospitality and our event hadn't even happened yet.\n\nOnward to our wedding day...the room was beautifully set up and Josh and Karen took over all responsibilities.  They showed us how to work the sound system and attended to all our needs.  Our guests complimented on the menu selections -- the filet mignon seemed to be the favorite.  I'm not sure I can adequately describe how the Grand Lux Cafe went above and beyond the call to make our wedding reception everything we wanted it to be.  You will not find another place on the Strip that will treat you like royalty without running you into wedding debt!  If I could give them more than five stars, I would.\n\nI highly, highly recommend the Grand Lux Cafe  at the Palazzo Hotel if you are looking for a private intimate (less than 80) wedding reception.  Call Rich and book your wedding reception there today!"

This appetizer is good with a beer!\n\nBurgers:\nThe Max Burger: Omfg!! burger effin heaven, I swear to you! Angus beef topped with short ribs, bacon, mushrooms and cheese! So delicious, I wanted to order another..but there was no way I was going to finish it! \nSanta Barbara Chicken Sandwich: Delicious, but nothing will top the Max Burger. \n\nEntrees:\nJamaican Pork Tenderloin: The presentation is so pretty, you dont want to eat it, but then your senses kick in and you start grubbin! With every bite of the tenderloin top off your fork with a little of the sweet mash potatos and mango salsa..your tongue will thank you!\nFried Chicken: An overload of delicious chicken tenders! \nCrispy Caramel Chicken: Spicy from the thai sauce, but there is caramel that blands down the kick of the spicyness and makes it a bit sweet. \nChicken Royale: if you want to play it safe, go ahead and pick this. simple and delicious.\n\nPizza: \nMargherita: Yummy with a huge beer! The pizza bread is very thin and super crispy.\n\nSimply put, the food is delicious. Be a risk taker and order something that sounds daring with the fusions of sauces, you wont regret it. \nThe presentation for all the plates are lovely.\n\nSuper Pro:\nOpen 24 hours!!"

Most of the good restaurants on the Strip were pretty much closed for the night and I didn't really want to settle with McDonald's, Denny's, or White Castle.  And because I didn't rent a car for this trip, I couldn't venture out to my usual late night off-Strip spots like Jinya Ramen or Bachi Burger.  So I decided to hit up my old reliable late night eating spot, Grand Lux Cafe.\n\nWhen I got there, I wasn't in the mood for a burger since I had one just a few hours earlier before my flight from SFO.  So I went with ordering a couple of appetizers from their late night menu, the Pastrami Reuben Egg Rolls and the Buffalo Chicken Rolls.  I kind of almost regretted ordering two apps though, because the portion sizes for each one were ridiculously huge and could basically be considered a meal on their own right.  \n\nPastrami Reuben Egg Rolls -- http://bit.ly/1TBZAi2\nHot Pastrami, Melted Cheese, Sauerkraut and Mustard in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with Thousand Island Dressing and Pickles\nThese were seriously good!  Basically you're taking everything that's awesome from a reuben and rolling them up into crispy egg rolls.\n\nBuffalo Chicken Rolls -- http://bit.ly/25jdk39\nChicken Breast, Cheese and Our Very Spicy Delicious Buffalo Sauce all Rolled in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing\nThese reminded me of those buffalo chicken rolls that you get at 7-Eleven, but kicked up several notches.  I liked with how much chicken was in each roll and how the buffalo sauce had a perfect amount of heat to them.\n\nSo basically I ordered two sets of uber egg rolls, but it didn't bother me one bit, especially since my waiter said they were two of his favorite apps on the menu.  I was struggling to finish both though because of their portion size, but I pushed through and finished!!  \n\nHoney Vanilla Latte -- http://bit.ly/1sRc7Tb\nDouble Espresso, Honey, Vanilla and Steamed Milk\nI ordered this basically to keep my night going into the wee hours of Saturday morning since my plan was to stay up as long as I could to make up for the lost hours from my delayed flight.  \nAnd it definitely did the job.  It was a nice flavor!  \n\nAll in all, I left Grand Lux Cafe stuffed, very satisfied, and ready to continue my late night gallivanting on the Strip.  I'm glad that they still deliver with quality late night eats!"

That is to say, we weren't even close to our usual rowdy level, but actually resembled a group of elderly men and women who were REALLY, REALLY SORE AND HUNGRY.\n\nWe stumbled to the front desk to ask for seating for nine. There was no one there. We waiting for another couple minutes, searching for someone to help us and found a couple of the wait staff helping other tables (there were probably a total of five occupied in the whole place) and a few people chatting near the back. Once someone noticed the huge scattered group, they ambled over to ask what they could do for us. As if it wasn't obvious already, we asked for a table for nine. The hostess told us to wait while they could find an open table and the wait would be around 10-15 minutes. Seriously? As we waited patiently yet astounded, we saw her and a few people walking around... I assumed they were setting up a table large enough for us but wondered why it could possibly take so long with no one else waiting and hardly anyone dining. \n\nAfter what felt like an eternity in Vegas time, we were sat at a banquet-style table (how hard could that have been to put together if it took any time at all?) with menus dropped off at the edge of the table for us to pass down to each other. The waiter left. He came back to ask what we wanted to drink. We said, waters, please. The waiter left. When he came back, he sloppily poured us all waters and left some of us with half-empty glasses. After asking us if we were ready to order five times in just as many minutes, he didn't come back at all. We had to flag down a DIFFERENT waiter to take down our simple-as-it-gets breakfast orders. Once that was all situated, it was purely a waiting game. \n\n10 minutes went by... 20... 30... by 40, everyone had forgotten why we were even there and I was straining to find ANYONE who worked in the place to ask where the F our food was. As if they decided it was long enough, by 50 or 60 minutes, our food showed up. Eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. You'd think with that kind of preparation time they could also get these beginner dishes right. Some dishes came with extra sides of meats that were never ordered but would later be charged e$$$tra; some came without the sides they were promised; and one or two dishes were forgotten altogether.\n\nWhen the bill came just as late as the food, we realized we had been had. The cheap dishes were almost doubled the cost on the menu bc the waiter never informed us of how much a side of three slices of bacon would cost, and some extras were brought out even without our consent. But we were over it. So, so over it. We paid the bill and left just as quietly as we came. Though I really wish we would have just dined and dashed (which is something my friends and I do not have the heart to do but it seemed so appropriate at the time).\n\nNever again."

The portions are so ridonkulously huge, you could easily feed a herd of elephants with one dish.\n\nI had the Zen Noodles and they were so much better than I expected. The broth was light, chicken stock and lemongrass goodness, accompanied by a grocery store of choices like basil leaves, bean sprouts and jalapeno pepper. It was soupy wonderland.

I don't always stay out all night, and so when I turn in early (read: before 6am LOL), this is my go-to establishment for a night cap before knocking out. \n\nI was in town over 4th of July weekend, and came in early on one of the evenings, so I headed over to The Venetian to get some food to wash out all the liquor in my system LOL.\n\nIt was around 4:45am, and the place was busy (It's Vegas, what establishment open that late isn't busy on a holiday weekend?). Service was quick. I got seated immediately and the waiter had bread and water to my table within 2 minutes of being seated -- I like that. It's funny, because I think the waiter saw it in my eyes that I had just come in from a long night, and so he brought over 2 glasses full of water and not once asked if I wanted anything to drink beside that LOL.\n\n My late-night staple at the Grand Lux is ALWAYS (100%) the Chicken & Waffle. Always! If you don't know, you better ask somebody! LOL -- That is always a God send after a long night of partying and drinking liquor like it was water LMAO! \n\nI ordered the Chicken & Waffle and the Shrimp Rolls on this occasion, although, I will say, the rolls were overkill -- With the bread they brought out, and the Chicken& Waffle order, that was more than sufficient for me. I still grabbed a couple bites of the rolls, and I will say that while they were tasty, they couldn't overcome the greatness of the Chicken & Waffle. \n\nThe waffle is always freshly done, great tasting with the maple syrup, and the chicken tenders oh so crisp, and delicious all-white meat. How could you not love this combo to end the night? I know I do. Both items I ordered were great tasting, and service was top notch, as always.\n\nYou can't go wrong with this establishment, and the same goes for the one inside The Palazzo.

Had I left enough room in my stomach from the night before, I surely would've opted for the the buffet. Instead, I decided upon Joe's Scramble (ground beef, onions, mushrooms, spinach, a side of hash browns, and toast). \n\n\"The menu says this thing is only $12 which means it is probably puny. I can make quick work of this.\" \n\nOr so I thought. The waitress returned with a rather hefty plate of food. The eggs were packed with hearty chunks of mushrooms and onions and spinach, and ground beef. There was so much, I didn't even finish. Moreover, the scramble was pretty tasty! Eggs weren't watery at all, nor were they overcooked. The has browns were perfectly crisp on top and moist underneath. My only real gripe with the meal was that the toast was moist and flimsy. I was not a fan. \n\nStill, it was a pretty solid meal and I would gladly pay the same amount for an omelet, even back home. I'm glad this was our closest breakfast option.

My husband and I were in Vegas with friends and we were the last couple to get in. Everything else was closed except this restaurant. Overall everything was descent. The sauces on the dishes were really good, but my husband didn't really like how thin his chicken was. \n\nThe bread was pretty good with the butter. I had the Chicken Indochine Dish (a curry dish but had characteristics of an Indian curry and a Chinese curry). My husband had the Chicken Madeira. My dish was really good. The sauce was just right. I liked how they had cherries and apricots in the dish to add some sweetness. My husbands dish was good he said but the chicken was a little to thin. He said it was like they pounded it like it was veal, but it just didn't work for that kind of chicken dish. \n\nOverall, it wasn't the best food ever but it wasn't bad for it to be a late night meal."

My most recent trip to Vegas (3 years later), I once again couldn't pass it up. As I expected the memory of the dish exceeded it's actual quality, but it was still pretty tasty and reasonably priced.

I personally don't care for Cheesecake Factory so this was a pleasant surprise that their menu vastly differs from their counterpart.  Their menu was pages and pages in length.  I wanted to order so many items!\n\nStaying at the Palazzo in December had led us (6 girls) not want to venture out much in the cold and just dine in primarily The Palazzo or the Venetian.  It so happened that we ended up here for both breakfast/lunch and dinner this past trip.  For breakfast/lunch they offer lunch specials for a reasonable price and from the looks of what my friends ordered, the portions seem filling to the point of having leftovers.  After a night of drinking, I always crave soup.  My friend mentioned pho earlier and we read the zen noodles description which sounded like pho so I thought to give it a try.  It tasted similar to pho, but lacking flavor.  It did come with chili, basil, and bean sprouts.  It did the job and hit te spot- and was enjoyable.  For dinner, I had an ahi appetizer which was fantastic.  It tasted very fresh and was accompanied by 3 types of salad: carrot, cucumber, and bean sprouts.  The cucumber and bean sprout salads were delish but the carrot salad really didn't have much flavor.  I could say that I enjoyed both my meals and that I wouldn't mind coming back.\n\nOn the other hand, some of my friends cared to disagree.  For lunch, my friend wanted a pickle to add to her sandwich but they said they didn't have pickles.  Not a big thing to me, but this displeased my friend.  For dinner when we came back, they had 2 soups of the day: cream of chicken and clam chowder.  3 of my friends ordered the clam chowder and maybe 20 minutes into waiting, the manager had to come up to our table to apologize and say they ran out of clam chowder.  What a disappointment to hear that the chowder was the special but they didn't have any left because they ran out of clams.  On both lunch and dinner meals, service was lacking.  It took at least 20-30 minutes+ wait for food.  Water was scarce and so was the waiter.  \n\nFood was good but questionable if worth the service/wait...."

What we didn't know was just how big this restaurant is. We thought it was just the small seating area you could see from the shopping area. The hostess brought us behind that all to a much larger dining room with nice decorations. It was somewhat dimly lit which we enjoyed. The menu is one of the most extensive we have seen. We decided to get a bbq chicken pizza and the beef wellington medallions. Both were fantastic. The sauce with the medallions was amazing. It included mushrooms, which I don't really like, yet I wouldn't have even known they were there. It was a delight to get a good Las Vegas dinner for under $20 a plate. I would recommend it more for adults but there were plenty of families there."

I opted for the tried and true and struck out several times. \n\nI had no wait to be seated and as I was guided to my table I almost wiped out as I slipped on the greasy floor in front of one of the kitchen door.

This tells me that they didn't have any kobe beef. Regaudless, I had to pick another choice now almost 20 min into the trip.  STRIKE TWO!\n\nFOOD Re-ORDERED:\nChicken Royale and Shrimp Scampi\nHouse Green Salad \n\nWHAT I GOT:\nHouse Green Salad ...  my salad and it was very good the blue cheese dressing was exceptional (although they charged me extra for it)  4****Stars\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VRVeFAfNVQtqdjvAZ23rQQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw\nChicken Royale and Shrimp Scampi ... I was pretty suprised by the entree it had lightly breaded shrimp in a citrius tasting cream sauce, masted potatoes grilled green beans and a thin piece of fried chicken with scallions. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tvJj23joNXjio7SdhYC5QA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw\nThis was not like any scampi I'd ever eaten nor was the chicken although tender very \"royal\".  Both tasted ok but I was not thrilled with what I got. The Mashed potatoes wer good as were the beans even though they were cold.\n\nI finished my meal, the buss lady took away my plates and I waited for my check. And waited, and waited until I finally flagged down another waitress who said she'd inform my waitress, and I waited some more. Finally after 15 min I got a check then had to wait 5 more min for her to run my card. STRIKE THREE! \n\nGrand Lux Cafe YOU're OUT!\n\nThe Grand Lux Cafe is is a very nice place with great atmosphere, maybe a tad too dark but it needs to really work on the service.\n\nI will not return to Grand Lux Cafe."

They are a sister company of Cheesecake Factory so that should give you an idea of the type and quality of food.\n\nSince most times im here for the late night, im going to have to recommend breakfast. You can always eat breakfast anytime of the day but something about having it after a night of drinking with friends.\n\nThe corn chowder is great. Its full of corn, not milky and theres bacon it in. Yes, alot of bacon. I did have to add a little pepper to spice it up a bit but it could be just me.\n\nThe fresh basil with moz cheese pizza is great. The moz is so fresh and the basil with the oil and the thin crust remind me of CPK but better. Oh did I just say that =)\n\nI would recommend to not go there during peek hours.

Huge menu, reasonably price, and very good food. The nice thing is that they aren't price gouging (as they easily could) considering its location within the Venetian.\n\nService was excellent. Our waitress was extremely attentive providing refills, more bread, and the check promptly. She was also very friendly and provided a lot of options that were recommended by her and frequently by guests. \n\nI ordered the caramel chicken which came with a large portion of rice. This was a massive portion and I could only eat half of it even though I was very hungry. The chicken was very good and nice and crispy. Very similar to an orange chicken from a chain restaurant but a bit sweeter and overall tasted better.\n\nOverall, great restaurant.. large portions, great service, and affordable."

It has a pretty nice variety of small muffins, bear claws, croissants, English muffins/bagels/toast, bacon, potatoes and a made-to-order omelet station.  The line can be pretty long, but those guys work pretty quickly.\n\nLots of the entrees come in a smaller lunch portion, and the service is always fantastic with drinks frequently refilled and servers coming to check on you.

Grand Lux Cafe is the spitting image of its sister, from the wait to the menu to the quality of food and service.  I've also eaten at the one in Beverly Hills.  All consistent.  It was Christmas dinner time in Vegas, and we were headed to the one at the Palazzo, but we came across the one in the Venetian first, and since it was only a 20 minute wait (unheard of in Cheesecake Factory land) we stayed.  Our server was nice and we got apologies from both her and the manager for the long wait of our food.  Hell, I didn't care as long as I had my pomegranate martini ($13) to sip on, and some warm bread and butter to munch on.\n\nI had the spaghettini w/ clams and rock shrimp.  Very garlicky and yummy.  I thought the pasta was a little on the dry side, until I got down to the bottom of my plate (yeah, it's a lot of pasta), where all the olive oil and white wine goodness had coagulated, probably from sitting under a lamp for awhile.  Anyways, it was good and I'd order it again.\nMy petite friend ordered the \"max burger\" which had everything on it including bits of beef shortrib (are you serious?!).  She managed to eat half of it, said it was great, but suggested that seasoned and/or curly fries would have been a better partner than regular fries.  Someone else ordered the fried chicken which looked like it could have fed our whole table.  It was served with mashed potatoes, snap peas, broccoli, and sweet potatoes.  It must've been delish cuz she ate all her sides before getting to the chicken.  The least favorite meal at the table was the pasta carbonara.  Bland and made with cherry tomatoes, which she didn't like.  I took the little cherries and added them to my dry pasta which was actually a good pairing.  \n\nAnd just like the Cheesecake Factory, we didn't have room for the cheesecake or any other dessert.  That was my bad."

There is another Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo but usually the Venetian is a lot closer for us to go to. They have a large variety of menu items that range from classic American food to different takes on various ethnic dishes. You also get bread and butter when you sit down. The reason why I like the Venetian Grand Lux Cafe more is that we get seated quickly. It doesn't matter what time we go or how big our group is. If you've noticed that Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory have similar menus, they're owned by the same company.\n\nWhen you order food, be prepared to eat. Their portions are big and you have enough to take back to your hotel room (if you have a fridge that is empty). I've ordered their bomb Caesar salad and I usually try different dishes when I go here. I had the Shaking Beef with Rice and that was pretty good. I usually get the Caramel Chicken and I can never finish it. \n\nWhen I recently went here with my family, my sister ordered the Beef Short Rib Sloppy Joe sandwich. It looked pretty good and it tasted pretty good. Usually all burgers come with fries. \n\nService is always top notch. The last time I went here we ended using a Visa Gift Card that the server botched when he put in the amount. He ended up resolving it but was super nice about it. He wasn't giving us attitude. Their servers are always attentive and ready to ensure that your order is correct.  \n\nFind parking in one of many parking garages in the Venetian parking lot. \n\nOrder one of their signature lemonades and you won't be disappointed. They also have sodas and a full bar. A couple of years ago, my friend ended up ordering a double shot of Tequila for his drink at dinner. \n\nBring a group, prepare yourself to eat and have fun in Vegas!"

And the serving sizes are also quite substantial. \nI made a comment to our waitress when she suggested splitting my husbands hash-browns because there were none available at the buffet, that the serving size my husband got with his breakfast wasn't big enough to split. She came out a few minutes later with a plate loaded with hash browns. How can you beat that service :-)"

            "review": "After a night out at Tao, my party split. Some were too drunk to continue the night, while others (including myself) held it together and carried on! I had the pleasure of staying at The Venetian, so we thought... Why go out to The Strip where it's incredibly hot? So we started looking... \n\nI'm not a big fan of going to sit-down places in Vegas; I really don't see the point. But the food court only had two places open - none of which seemed appealing. Luckily, a worker of the Venetian walked by us, so I (probably drunkly) walked up to her and asked if there were any other places that we could eat. She was really nice, pointed at Grand Lux, and said, \"It's REALLY good.\" I was sold. \n\nWe walk in (party of four) and are immediately seated. Our server is VERY nice and attentive - and please keep in mind this was around 3 am - so I really doubt he wanted to be there. I forgot his name, but the guy was awesome. \n\nOnto food: We ordered the BLT sandwich, someone else ordered a burger, and per the servers recommendation, someone ordered Asian nachos (AMAZING, btw). I ordered the Bacon-Cheese burger(!!!!!). \n\nThe Asian nachos were freaking amazing... They're made with crispy friend wontons, covered with chicken, sweet peanut sauce, and wasabi cream and melted cheese! The plate comes with about ten of them, and we were all able to get one and enjoy it. It's just crispy goodness! Very yummy. \n\nMy Bacon-Cheese burger was freaking good. I just reviewed GR's BurGR, and I was really unimpressed with the service and food. My burger was a disappointment. Luckily, I had come to the GLC the night before, so this burger was still on my mind. I ordered it well done, and it was made perfectly. It's ANGUS beef with crispy bacon, melted American cheese, grilled onions, and mayo. I really recommend it! I was starving, and yet, I couldn't even finish it. It was huge! The fries that it came with were meh, but nothing a little ranch can't fix. \n\nOverall, I can recommend this place for lunch or at least for the Asian nachos and burger that I ordered. The service was GREAT, but the time it took to get our food was a bit long... No matter. He kept checking on us, and made sure that our drinks were filled. That alone is good enough for me."

Darn, once again I forgot to take photos of the wonderful food we enjoyed last night. Almost any meal I've ever had here can be shared by two.\n\nA nice warm crusty loaf of bread is brought to the table to start. For my entree I tried something new last night, Indochine Shrimp & Chicken ($19) & it was 5 star. The flavor was out of this world: onions, ginger, cranberries, sun-dried cherries in a plum wine cream curry sauce served with rice. I ate a lot but I didn't even get through half of it. My friend had Parmesan Chicken (under $20) & he agreed with what I told him I had thought in the past: best he's ever had. He also had more than half left-over. \n\nWhile eating we saw a monster strawberry shortcake dessert get carried past us & my friend had to try that-delicious. I had the waiter bring me an eclair from the bakery attached to the restaurant. Again, leftovers.\n\nThough I gave GLC 5 stars, if 4 1/2 were an option I'd have demoted it. Or if I have the same problem with the waitstaff again I'll give it 4 stars: The wait for the entree & then the dessert was very long. Our water glasses were never refreshed. I wasn't asked if I wanted white or brown rice with my dish. There's another reason I might demote GLC in the future: it's quite noisy & tables are crowded pretty closely together. Upon my insistence we were lucky enough to be seated at one of the only booths in the place.\n\nI still highly recommend Grand Lux Cafe to locals & visitors wanting a reasonably priced  great meal & varied menu."

The restaurant itself is quite large, so even during the dinner rush we were seated within 5mins of putting our names down. Once we were seated, we spent  a good 10mins going through the pages and pages of the menu. Luckily, they served warm bread & butter to munch on while deciding on what to eat. \n\nWe all ended up choosing a 'medium plates', which was actually still too big for any of us to finish. My housemade pierogies were so delicious! Light, fluffy potato dumplings served on top of braised short ribs & mushrooms.. mmm. I also tried a bit of the kobe (softball-sized) meatballs in the creamy cheesy polenta which were also great. Our appetizer of wings were also moist inside with a nice crunchy exterior. Yum! Considering how much food they give, the prices are definitely reasonable and they are open 24/7, which is perfect for everyone in Vegas!"

The cheesecake factory owns this place and it runs about the same.\n\nWe got a side salad (as opposed to the meal salad) and it was huge too.  One side salad and one main course = dinner for two easy.\n\nOnly complaint was that when we asked if pasta was made fresh on premises we got an evasive answer.  He should have just said no, it was not made fresh on premises.  He said it was all made \"for them\" and some other language that appeased us at the time, but disappointed us a bit when the food came and the pasta was obviously not fresh.  I know, we were dreaming to think we could get fresh pasta made that day for that price, but we were in Vegas, where my sister eloped and dreams come true, right?  On the upside, the pasta was not over-cooked and limp.\n\nAll in all a solid meal and I would go back, especially if I were trying to get decent food at a decent price on the strip.  This is almost as low a price as a place like Nathan's Famous hot dogs, especially if you share a main course, which the portion sizes will definitely let you do, but here you get to sit down and eat a nice meal.

It's owned by the same people who started Cheesecake Factory and while it feels similar, it doesn't at the same time.\n\nThe first time I came to this restaurant, I had never been to Cheesecake Factory.  I did not realize that they had humongo portions.  This was my first visit to Vegas and my first encounter with Grand Lux.  I ordered the ahi tuna salad to start, then I ordered a full entree (which I don't remember at all, probably because I barely ate any of it).  I had NO idea the ahi tuna salad was so huge.  It is a meal in itself.  Everything here is huge, but consistently tasty and fresh and on par with the cost of everything else in Vegas.  In retrospect, I am kind of wondering why the waiter/waitress who helped us didn't warn me that I was ordering *WAY* too much food?  \n\nMy husband's favorite sandwich is the hamburger that is topped with bbq shortribs and fried onion strings (or something like that - it's a major meat fest).  Their menu is very eclectic with a vast array of choices (fish, meat, pasta, asian fusion, etc.), much like Cheesecake Factory - except they don't have advertisements scattered throughout it.\n\nThis last visit in June, we only made it to Grand Lux for brunch.  We shared a stack of dinner platter sized pancakes and shared an egg white omelette (filled with mushrooms, cheddar and ham) with toast and hash browns.  Yummy and definitely large enough for us to share.  This was the cheapest meal we had on our trip to Vegas (somewhere around $30 for two)\n\nWe also sat in the 'outside' area where you can do some serious people watching since you are right on the outskirts of the casino near the entrance towards the Sands convention center and the bank of elevators that takes you to the main hotel tower.  \nThe interior is nice as well with roomy booths and regular tables.\n\nService is efficient and courteous.  Definitely no complaints."

We got in late the first day and were looking for something reasonably priced that was convenient.  My wife had heard of it before as they have locations in other cities.  We live in Houston and there is one there.  We started with the Volcano Shrimp.  I believe they were supposed to be spicy, but were not in the least bit. That being said they were delicious.  They were fresh and perfectly battered.  They had an Aioli on the side which you didn't need, but complimented the flavors.  For dinner, I had braised pot roast with pan roasted carrots and broccolini.  The cut of pot roast was huge and tender.  It had a little fat, but not too much and it added extra flavor.  The gravy that came with it was awesome.  It comes with a creamy horse radish, but I asked for mine on the side.  I like to get the creamy mix and add a lot of the raw horse radish to the creamy mix to make it spicy.  My wife had the asian salad.  She said it was yummy and fresh.  For dessert we shared a strawberry cheesecake which was tasty.  The meal was about $60, before tip.\n\nFor breakfast the next morning I had sausage links, hash browns, scrambled eggs, and sourdough toast.  The sausage was great.  Everything else was standard as it is with hash browns and eggs. I took a pancake from my wife and it was delicious.  My wife got a ham, havarti, onion, and spinach omelette, with hash browns.  She said it was nicely seasoned and didn't need to add anything to it.  This means a lot coming from her.  As she is heavy handed with seasoning.  Many times I have seen her add salt before tasting.  I'll eat the same thing and think it is good without anything extra, while she is adding a fair amount of salt.  The meal was a shade under $50.  For being in The Venetian and on the strip it definitely is reasonably priced and worth the money.  They serve quality food.  I would definitely recommend to anyone."

They have a huge menu with a large selection of meals, so it catered to all types of eaters and the different cravings you would have for each day of the week and time of the day. They have different menus for breakfast, lunch, dinner, evening, and even late night.\n\nThis is one of the only places open 24 hours a day!\n\nThe portions are great and the food is decent. It's hard to go wrong with this place. Also service is quite good here and on-par with service in restaurants around the hotel. Breakfast here was kind of disappointing, with small portions and expensive prices. So I suppose the prices are sort of inflated, no surprise since you're within Venetian, but the it's not as inflated as other restaurants and the foot is still pretty good.\n\nI had Salmon Carpaccio the first night and that was really good, but some what expensive $22 - $24 ( I don't remember right now). And the following day had your standard breakfast like scrambled eggs, toast, hash brown, ham and that was something like $18. Which was totally not worth it for me.\n\nAll in all, I'd return!"

Its similar to the Cheesecake Factory but its in veeeeeegass and its open late nights for all the hungry drunkies! There's so much on the menu we didn't know where to start. Last year I had the cobb salad (wonderful fat salad) this year I went for the buffalo chicken sandwich. It was okay, wasn't spicy enough. My bf had jimbalaya and it was hella good. My friend really enjoyed his pastrami sandwich, finished all of it before we did. \n\nAs for dranks, I had the patron paloma. It was so good I could barely taste the alcohol. My sandwich+drink was probably $25, pretty pricey for a meal but I had leftovers of sandwich and fries for later (which were never touched and left at Cosmo hotel room garbage). Hehe.\n\nService was excellent, our waitress was funny, we tipped her well."

Once you are there, seating options are inside the restaurant or at one of the tables that is out in the casino. \n\nMy only complaint from the trip was what I imagine to be the only complaint I would ever have with the Grand Lux, the iced tea was not very good. My dissatisfaction goes no further. In fact, from there my satisfaction actually grows rapidly. \n\nI believe on the menu it is listed as Creamy Spinach and Cheese Dip...though more commonly Spinach and Artichoke dip...and it just might be the best I have ever had. The dip is served with plenty of tortilla chips, so you never have to worry about running out of things to dip, a problem I frequently encounter at other restaurants. \n\nIf you are familiar with the menus at The Cheesecake Factory, then you understand how overwhelmed you can feel at Grand Lux Cafe as well. So many items on the menu and they all sound good. There just aren't enough hours in the day for a menu like that, but you have to start somewhere.\n\nI ordered the Fried Chicken. The meal I anticipated, a breast/thigh/leg with a side of mashed potatoes, would have been right for how hungry I was. The meal I got, a veritable mountain of chicken strips with a side of mashed potatoes, was a bit more than I could handle. I think the chicken was like $13-14. You cannot beat that. \n\nGrand Lux has locations in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston and Chicago with two future locations of Garden City, NY and Sunrise, FL. At least in the cities where there are currently locations, there are so many restaurants and I always try to not go to the same place twice when I travel since there are so many options. I will have to fight to stick to that when I have the option to go back to Grand Lux Cafe. The place is even open 24 hours (in Las Vegas)!"

They suggested Grand Lux; I had never heard of this place before even though its a chain and I didn't even know it was part of the Cheesecake Factory family until I Yelped it (Like the good yelper I am, I referred to my iPhone app to spy on this place before diving in)* and was relieved to find that it got pretty good reviews. \n\nWe ate here twice. First time was yum nummy.\n\nLunch: \n--Buffalo chicken rolls HOLY COW good; \n--Ryan's Enchilada lunch special was very good\n--My chicken salad/house salad/chicken and mushroom soup was.. a little bland, it was okaaay, but It needed SOMETHING. Finished my salad the vinaigrette was good. \n\nThey have some pretty good lunch deals which are HUGE servings even for lunch. The Buffalo chicken rolls were soo good, I crave them all the time. \n\nDinner (the next day) \n--Ryan got Crispy Caramel Chicken with Rice which was pretty good although we were a bit apprehensive about the caramel part. \n\n++Now here's where they lose points++\n--I got the flat bread spicy chicken sandwich which was HORRIBLE! Bland Bland; Flat bread was tough and tasted like cardboard, chicken was bland and tasted like Subway \"roasted chicken\" the spicy mayo was gross and the fries were way too crunchy & COLD. I was so disappointed. \n\n--Good thing I was able to get a little full from the Buffalo Rolls we ordered again. \n\n\nIt seemed like I got the short straw here.. My food was never that great, but Ryan's was waaay better. Almost like a different place.

Advertised as a lunch sized portion, I figured it would be perfect for me to eat and not have too much left over. I'm still trying to figure out who the portion was meant for...a 300-lb man, perhaps? There was no way this little lady would ever be able to eat this in one sitting! In fact, I brought it home and made two more meals out of it!\n\nThat said, the chicken parmesan was wonderful! Unlike others that tend to be dry, this was moist and flavorful. The pasta needed a bit more sauce for my liking (I like it dripping in it), but the waitress happily brought me a side of marinara. Priced at $13 or $14 (I can't remember), it was a great deal!\n\nBe prepared to wait awhile for your food but at least they offer complimentary bread and butter to snack on."

The chicken  is similar to chicken strips and are placed over a waffle. The best thing about it is the maple-butter syrup. OMG it must be so bad for you (what isn't here?) but it is so freakin good. I never would have thought sweet, syrupy chicken would taste so good with a waffle. \n\nThe breakfast cocktails were also very good. Peach bellini, mimosa, and a pomegranate cocktail. They were on the sweeter side, which I like, but might not have enough booze for some. \n\nAlthough it's not a buffet, it is definitely a place to get your feast on.

Squirt some ketchup, and I was good to go. \n\nMy wife had the smoked salmon plate, and it was pretty darn good. We sat next to the breakfast buffet, which many people opted for around $16.

The menu selection is huge, and can be difficult to decide what to order if you are not familiar the menu, but the staff is quick to offer suggestions.\n\nOn my most recent stop here after catching Jersey Boys, we didn't have to wait long to get seated.

But the waitress recommended the spicy ginger beef which uses even more tender beef supposedly. It tasted almost the same just a little bit more spicy and gingery. I think if I ordered it without the spice and ginger it wouldve tasted nearly the same with just the sauce and green onions. But the spicy ginger beef was just WOW. i didnt expect it to be that good!"

The Grand Lux is practically right at the bottom of the elevators from where we were. Both nights we stayed, we got takeout food from them and both nights, we were wowed by the quality, taste and presentation of our dinners. Portions were on the big side, and everything was extremely tasty and quickly prepared. It says that it's from the creators of The Cheesecake Factory, and that would give you a good idea of the quality of food you're getting here. A tad on the pricey side, but worth it."

He never confirmed my order and actually skipped over completely my order and started asking the other guest with me what they wanted to order.  This was completely RUDE of Nathan \"Nate\".  Not sure if Nathan was having a bad day, but Nathan needs to be retrained on how to be a professional waiter.  Having an attitude and an ego as a waiter will get you no where Nathan.

Since we stayed at the Venetian this time around, instead of venturing out into the hot Vegas summer, we stayed on the Venetian property for the majority of the time and Grand Lux is a favorite among my friends, which also meant we ate a lot of Grand Lux.  There is a food court, but we weren't really feeling it.  \n\nGrand Lux is good, especially for large groups because it is a huge restaurant and they can easily accommodate bigger groups.  The menu is also very diverse, from breakfast to Asian-inspired dishes.  It's owned by Cheesecake Factory, so I always thought of Grand Lux as a very expensive diner.\n\nWent for the Chicken & Waffles, Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich, and a Lunch combo for my visits this time around.  The Chicken & Waffles is a favorite of mine.  Belgian waffle that's topped with fried chicken strips and comes with this great brown butter maple.  The grilled cheese sandwich was the first time, and while good, it was just a bit too greasy for me.  Lunch combo with salad, soup, and sandwich is a solid choice for a little variety.  Grand Lux always have good soups at all times, and this time, got to try the Chicken Mushroom Cream, as well as the Chicken Tortilla.  The Chicken Tortilla seriously tastes like liquidfied nachos!  It's pretty damn delicious haha.\n\nAlso tried my friend's jambalaya.  Not even close to being the real thing, but not gonna lie, it is pretty damn tasty.  It's more like a stir-fried dish with cajun spices & seasoning!\n\nThe place is open 24/7, which is another reason why we came here so many times in one weekend.  After a night out, Grand Lux.  Dinner?  Grand Lux.  Another night out, sure why not Grand Lux again.  \n\nNeed to convince the others to eat something else next time."

Coffee and juice also included so a good value. Bad thing about it was the \"conventioneers\" who descended in masses and lined up for this breakfast so to get an omelet took forever.

Everything we had was fine, but nothing was spectacular. \n\nService\n-They told us when we arrived that one person was taking our order and another would be taking care of us after, due to a shift change. The heads-up was good, but when the order came out wrong, the second server wasn't that helpful in fixing it. One of our friends ordered an egg white omelette and it came out made with eggs. He asked the waitress who said they could fix it, but it would take awhile. Shouldn't something they messed up be expedited?\n\nFood\n-We all got eggs or an omelette. The omelettes were pretty large and not greasy. My husband and I got ours made with veggies, and it definitely came with a lot of fresh veggies. The home fries they were served with looked like they were frozen and heated.\n-Bread came in a basket for the whole table with butter and jam. It was toasted and pretty good. Nothing special, though.\n-Not really their fault due to when we arrived for our meal, but wish they served breakfast for longer.\n\nDrinks\n-I just had water, but my husband and our friend each got a bloody mary. It was served with two pickled asparagus on top, which they both enjoyed a lot. They said they drink was a healthy amount of spicy!\n\nAmbiance\n-This is one of those places right off the casino floor. I get that many people come to Vegas for this, but it's actually not an aspect I enjoy due to all of the cigarette smoke. We were seated on the perimeter of the restaurant, so quite close to the casino. The restaurant is all open to the casino, but perhaps requesting a seat a bit further to the interior of the restaurant would block this smell a bit?\n\nThis was pretty quick and easy, but given the amount of options in Vegas, not sure I'd run back."

Served with Pasta and Wine Sauce\nChicken Pot Pie- omg, this is HUGE! It could feed 2-3 seriously with big chunks of chicken and veggies.\nBest on the menu: Mediterranean Mahi Mahi-Crusted Fresh Mahi with Roasted Tomato, Artichoke, Capers, Basil, Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar over mashed potatoes.\n\nYuck: Asian nachos--wayyyy too sweet, I ate half a chip and fed the rest to A.\nRib eye steak: A ordered it and well, its the quality of a cafe-if you want steak just pay and go to a steakhouse"

Get ready to spend about a half hour looking over the menu if you read every item.  Do not come here if you are indecisive; it could take you an entire day to decide.\n\nI tried the mashed baked potato spring rolls and they were fantastic, but the portion was large enough to split for 4.  My lunch-sized Southwest Salad was also delicious but a bit too large.  It makes me sad to think about how much food they must waste here each day.\n\nI didn't have any problems with the service being rude/incompitent.

SO. FRICKIN. GOOD. and the salad that had a delish roasted tomato-caramelized onion vinaigrette. it's too bad i just couldn't finish all this yummy food. they definitely don't skimp on the quality of the food!\n\nfellow, veg buds, this is a great place to load up on great food. another note: the fresh mozzarella pizza is fantastic. it's got roasted tomatoes, spinach, artichokes, and garlic. and my dad loves their spaghetti with clams -- a great portion for 17 bucks. oh great...now i'm getting reeeeally hungry for some grand lux."

I normally seek out unique foodie experiences and avoid chain restaurants like the plague, so naturally I assumed when the family wanted to go that I would have to settle for it. Boy was I wrong...\n\nThe first visit we went for brunch (Sunday am, seated right away). Two of the kids got Belgian waffles with strawberries and whip, the other, the Italian Market Sandwich. The waffles were good, but the sandwich was amazing. My son generously offered each of us a small bite and agreed it was the best sandwich ever!  \"Thinly Sliced Prosciutto, Pepperoni and Salami, Topped with Fontina Cheese and Arugula on Rustic Bread with Sun-Dried Tomato-Basil Aioli\". My husband and I both ordered the egg breakfast which was prepared well and included Niman Ranch bacon. The orange juice was fresh squeezed (really, not like other restaurants advertise), and the fresh fruit actually ripe and flavorful. We were very impressed with the quality of the food, but also the inventiveness of the menu- not your standard chain restaurant fare. Everyone was very happy all around. \n\nAfter much debate about where to go for dinner  (we were there to go to Dos Caminos or Bouchon), we all decided to go here again. We ordered: a BLT (yummy bacon and bread), the Max Burger (has short ribs on it), Sunday Night Pasta (daughter said it was the best past she has ever had), Chop Salad (the only average meal we ordered), and a Top Sirloin steak w/fries ( I had my heart set  on steak frites, but every restaurant in Vegas starts steak at $40 + $9 fries- ridiculous!) The steak was tender, flavorful, and well cooked. At $28 for the 8oz steak and $4.95 for the fries I was very pleased). \n\nAgain, a great experience all around. Bravo to Grand Lux for bringing quality dining at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is fine, and simply elegant (but really, does every restaurant have florescent lights now?), but a bit noisy. Compared to fancier places with big names and higher checks, this exceeded our other experiences."

Everything in vegas is so expensive and it was nice to find a place with good quality food and great service that we didn't have to spend an arm and a leg on.  The server was very friendly and checked on us often.  She told us the restaurant is owned by the cheesecake factory and to expect big cheesecake factory portions.  We both had burgers, the were gigantic and they tasted great.  I plan to vist the grand lux every time I go to vegas"

            "review": "Grand Lux Cafe is the only thing wrong happening at the Palazzo/Venetian. If I wanted to eat at this kind of place I would be hanging out at a Lakewood strip mall, debating Chili's or TGIF's. The menu is huge and they can do that because just like Chili's, or Friday's or any of your other dime a dozen national franchise restaurants nothing is really that fresh except for maybe the salads. All the sauces and seasonings came out of a bottle shipped from their main plant in Kentucky or somewhere else absolutely no wear near the kitchen that prepped your meal. \n\nAs if that kind generic nastiness isn't shameful enough on the strip, myself and several friends, on completely separate occasions have gotten sick after eating here. So many Vegas trips, so many hangovers, and nothing has ever compared to waking up the morning after a late night meal at Grand Lux. I've only had to drive home from Vegas one time, I'm always the passenger, like an older Asian woman, nobody trusts me to drive, except the morning after the night my bf/driver ate a Grand Lux sandwich. Luckily for me, I tasted the chemical yuck and only took a few bites causing low grade discomfort. He unfortunately is a guy and as such will eat almost anything served between two slices of bread. He suffered the consequences, he wasn't right for a good three days. I went to town eating all kinds of good stuff while he sat there watching regretting each and every bite of that rancid sandwich. \n\nIf you think I'm just hating on Grand Lux I dare you to just buy a sandwich and take it back to your room and eat it. As soon as that Styrofoam container hits your room, everything clean and hotel nice smelling about your room will dissipate; instead it will smell like somebodies armpit. Dare to leave that thing in your room over night and it will evolve into armpit mixed with gym sock. AWFUL!"

Most meals look good but taste inauthentic in the city, but Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 was a notable exception. \n\nWe had to order from the late night menu since we were eating in around 5 am. I had a Cappuccino and their Turkey and Brie Sandwich which was delicious! My friends got Omelettes which looked delicious too. The waiters are friendly and patient especially given the number of drunk patrons they have here. \n\nOne of the better places to dine in the Venetian buildings and might I say, the Las Vegas Strip."

After exhausting yourself thusly, head to the Grand Lux and order the Grand appetizer platter for the table (try to do this around 3 or 4 am). This is way too much food for two people, but it's affordable and tasty (I especially love the Asian inspired items on the plate). \n\nWhile you wait the 45 minutes for your food to arrive, take in the sites: pretty and polished Venetian clientele dressed up and popping energy tablets with their wine (I think they're in from LA). Sitting here is reinvigorating! It makes you realize that you can stay up and play some more poker! You can drink five more $1 Miller Lights at O'Sheas!

This time, we were at Vdara, but we just had to go there for our late night munchies. Totally worth cabbing there for food.\n\nI love love love their Pasta With Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella. (Their pastas are bomb!) The portion was HUGE. Although I was super hungry, I only ate about half of the dish. Good thing though because I woke up hungry still craving Grand Luxe and there was a good amount of pasta left! The sauce was flavorful and evenly distributed throughout the dish. Their chicken was A+. Chicken is my favorite kind of meat, so I am a bit picky about chicken in dishes, but the chicken here is DELICIOUS! It's not dry at all, and they give you a generous amount.\n\nThe boys all ordered burgers, and when their orders came out, I wish I ordered my pasta and a burger. Alas, although it sounded okay in my head, it's probably not socially acceptable to order two entrees, huh? \n\nThey are pretty busy at all hours, so you might have to wait for their servers a bit. We waited a pretty long time before someone came to take our orders. That was no bueno! But what can you do when this restaurant has a full house and a line at 1am?"

We started with the Stacked chicken quesadilla. It was crispy and savory and stuffed with whole black beans, green chiles, tomatoes, tender moist chicken, melted cheese and sprinkled with kernels of sweet yellow corn *sigh*... really it was that good. I went with a lunch special. Had the pasta carbonara and a small house salad. The salad was, well salad. The dressing was tasty and the greens were crisp. The pasta was wholesome, rich and loaded with smoked bacon, peas, mixed with creamy blends of cheese. it was very fulfilling. After eating a slice of bread or two and a wedge of quesadilla I could only eat about half my pasta before I was full. Baby had the Burger Melt. It sat on some sort of garlic parmesan bread, had lots of cheese and grilled onions, I had a bite. It was very big and intimidating, great if you like meat. The fries were crispy and and not overly salted. They told us about their fresh baked desserts which we didn't have the pleasure of trying. Now as to the best, yes I'm saving it for last. The Grand Lux Peach Bellini *moan moan moan* OMG, seriously orgasm in my mouth. I could taste the bubbly but it didn't overpower, had a slushy like consistency, a nice big amount of peaches and a big ripe red strawberry to top it all off. I could've drank ten. Best ten dollars I've spent in my life. So fruity and refreshing and just a burst of joy for my taste buds, I'm going back for a few more as soon as I can. The food was good it deserve a three and a half but I'm giving them a five for the Bellini itself. Peach Bellini for breakfast? Yes please!"

We don't ask lots of questions, we start with please and end with thank you, and we never give the wait staff a hard time with anything, ever.\n\nWe ordered two iced teas, sliders, and mashed potato \"egg\" rolls. Hey, it's 1am. Anyways we get our drinks, ok. But he never comes back to refill them.... ever! We finished them before our meals. He brings the food and I guess it's my fault I didn't ask for more... the dry cups weren't a sign. Nonetheless he drops off the food and disappears into the night like a caped crusader. Meanwhile he waits on the table directly next to us. He 1. Didn't refill the drinks. 2. Asked if we needed condiments 3. Check back at all. 4. Didn't bring the bill or clear the plates until I nicely got his attention. He earned a $2.25 tip on a $30 check. I'd never ever ever tip under 18% ever ever but this guy was shit. I shouldn't have to ask for a refill. You bring my food, you see it's empty, and you refill it... like their been doing the last 200 years. You at least should check up on us once. You didn't. You suck. Do not pass go and do not collect 20%.\n\nI blame the ass waiter not the restaurant. It's the first time I received poor service here."

It was more of a family place than a trendy exciting restaurant.

Grand Lux Cafe is located inside the Venetian on the Casino floor near the guest elevators.\n\nPROS:\n-  Located inside the Venetian.  That's a pro in my book since no matter where I stay in Vegas, I always end up somewhere near the Venetian.\n-  Place is open late!!  Is this place 24 hours?  I'm not sure, but I love the fact that you can go clubbing and come here afterwards.\n-  Service is fantastic!  We got our food efficiently, everything came out for our group together, and she was attentive.\n-  Food quality is just delicious!  I got their Chicken Carbonara and it was so creamy.  Bacon bits in there were thick and juicy.  I could have licked the whole plate clean.  Bread they give you was also fluffy and chewy.  Yum!! \n-  Ambiance is beautiful!  It's like Cheesecake Factory but a notch fancier.\n-  There is so much variety with food selection, so this is perfect for if you are in Vegas with a group.  Everybody can find SOMETHING to order on the menu.\n\nCONS:\nI have none!  That's why this place is getting all 5 stars from me ;)"

The typical hash browns, omelet, watery eggs, fruits, yogurt, cereal, make your own toasts, bacon, sausage...which also includes a beverage.  It was only around $15 for this or you could choose something from the menu which I did another day.  Their corned beef hash was the worst I could have possibly tasted, we were hoping it would taste the ones similar to Bellagio's room service or the one at The Cafe at TheHotel at Mandalay Bay.  \nWe only came here because it is located in the Venetian Hotel where we had stayed.

One had a frozen Margarita that was well made and not overly sweet.\n\nWe stuck with appetizers on this trip, and the best of all were the crab cakes.  No doubt the best I've had with lumps of crab in a well seasoned mixture lightly grilled.  \n\nWe ordered the appetizer combo and enjoyed the following:\n\nVietnames Spring Rolls with chicken and fresh cut veggies in a steamed, cold wrap served with peanut sauce or spicy sweet and sour sauce.  Philli Cheese Steak spring rolls with diced steak and cheese in an eggroll wrappper fried and served with chipotle mayonaise.  Also eggroll style was the buffalo chicken served with the absolute best bleu cheese dressing I've ever had.  My husband's favorite were the steamed duck dumplings.  The Spinach Artichoke dip was creamy with plenty of artichoke. \n\nFor dessert I had to revert to my all time favorite creme brulee duo - one vanilla and one chocolate.

From Miami (beautiful restaurant location) to good ol' Las Vegas you can have a pretty good shot of finding one. If you're ever traveling this is a sure bet of a place to go with a large crowd if you have a wide variety of eaters including the picky ones. On the menu you can find entrees from salmon, steak, salads, and the menu is about 8 pages I felt like. SO MANY OPTIONS. The food is consistently good and I have always been a fan of their brunch especially the Sunday \"All you can eat brunch\" at the location inside the Venetian. The food is moderately priced especially considering you are eating in one of the most expensive cities to eat at. So it shouldn't come as a shocker when you're paying a nice penny; however, still far below the price of some amazing restaurants around town. I was fortunate enough to pick off of everyone's plate (yes I'm that friend) and each one was hot, properly cooked, and made correctly. The wait time is fairly quick and impressive considering how many people come to eat at this location. One thing for this particular location that bugged me was the underwhelming factor of the decor. Compared to their other locations I've eaten at this one was not impressive to say the least. Overall this is a great location to visit if you're wanting to host a large crowd without having to wait forever and a day."

I have also never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  I went to the Grand Lux twice during my stay at the Venetian.  The first time was for the breakfast where I got the breakfast buffet option.  The orange juice was really good and it tasted like it was freshly squeezed.  The fruit offered at the buffet line also tasted fresh and there were a decent selection.  The other buffet offering were pretty standard.  They offered hash browns, scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon that was way too oily.  There was also an omelet station, but I did not get to have one made because the line was too long and I was hungry!  They also had an assortment of pastries, but I would have rather seen pancakes and waffles instead.  I was also disappointed to see that they did not have cottage cheese, which I thought was a breakfast buffet staple.  Everything cost $20 including tax and tip, but for that amount of money I would like to see more buffet options.\n\nThe second time I went was for late night dining.  I started with the broccoli cheddar soup which was RUNNY and BLAND and did not come with crackers or bread until I requested it.  I got the chicken and waffles as my main dish.  The waffle itself was pretty good.  It had good crunchy texture and buttery taste.  The chicken was also decent, but I should point out that these were chicken tenders and not fried chicken with the bone.  It was served with a pecan maple syrup.  I've never had authentic chicken and waffles, but I have a feeling that the original would have been a lot better than GLC\"s upscale version."

If not for her, it very easily would've been two stars.\n\nWe decided to come here at 1AM due to a lack of other veggie options (it seems like everything vegan is shut down at midnight for some reason). \n\nThe restaurant is nestled in the Venetian hotel, with bistro style seating right next to the casino. Inside, however, it's a bit more intimate with the dim lighting. We could still hear the occasional victory cheers from patrons who hit the jackpot in the casino. Definitely not a quiet place, but a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the casino. \n\nTo start, we spent a good amount of time studying the drink menu. They've got some stellar cocktails, all on the weaker side and kind of expensive, but that's the Strip for ya.\n\nPi\u00f1a colada: not bad.\nMojito: the bomb.\n\nThey've also got several wine and beer options for those looking to avoid cocktails. \n\nWhen ordering food, we noticed they have separate menus available depending on what time of day it is. Their overnight menu has a lot of options: my friends got sliders, a breakfast plate piled high with bacon, and a couple cheeseburgers. They also have many steak, pasta, pizza, and salad options. But again, I woefully found a lack of vegan options on this menu.\n\nThis is where Debbie came in to save the day. She finagled with the chefs to see if they'd cook up a special dish for me. And they did just that. I was brought a beautiful plate of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, and brown rice. Large servings, well displayed, and made to order. It hit the spot and kept the night from going down a disappointing path.\n\nWe never felt rushed. And I was pleased to see one of the chefs, decked out in his nice white chef jacket, personally come out to let us know the progress of our meals.\n\nDebbie checked on us routinely but didn't hover, and she really was a sweetheart.\n\nUltimately, it was a great late night dining experience."

Our group came here for both occasions and the food was equally as good as the other. Not only were there tons of things to choose from but they all were really appetizing. The prices were decent and it's something different from the fast food court. We came to this specific location for lunch one day and we all got different things. I ordered the half salad and pasta de telefono. The salad was a spring mix and was good, and the pasta was very cheesy but since I enjoy cheese it was delicious. The addition of chicken was a rip off but I needed some poultry with my pasta so I couldn't complain too much. Others had pastas, salmon and sandwiches which I heard were all good as well."

And that's fine if you want a coffee that's included but no juice.  Bacon, sausage, etc. all pork meat choices, no beef or turkey substitutes. And we, along with probably half the world's population don't eat pork. So we were left with eggs, toast, muffin and hash browns. And they were all prepared very well. \n\nOur server Joe, took it upon himself to take his pick of an 18% gratuity. Something normally only done with a group of diners. That was this past Saturday, 3/12/16. I guess Joe didn't think we'd give him a decent tip.\n\nOn the other hand, the following morning breakfast experience was much nicer. 3/13/16, with an upbeat waitress whose name escapes me; the bubbly and friendly redhead with a smile. Same breakfast choices as the previous morning. And when presented with the bill, the customer's suggested tip options of 15%, 18% and 20% were there for the customers choosing. Something totally absent the previous morning Joe. This wonderful server received the 20% gratuity. She truly earned it."

I had the pasta carbonara and the sauce was good, a bit bland and the pasta was a bit overcooked.  However, the bf LOVED the fried spring rolls that you roll in lettuce.  Kinda a hybrid between egg rolls and lettuce wraps.  I have to admit, it was good.\n\nWeird part.  I made a friend at my table.  There was a little ant crawling around.  He wanted some of my pasta and since I didn't finish it myself, I gave him some.  Sadly, he drowned in the oil.  \n\nAnyway, on to desserts.  Their desserts give them a one up on cheesecake.

I see that many have mentioned that the food is like Cheesecake Factory but i think this place is much better and the portion size is ridiculous. Every entree can be shared between two people comfortably and the best part? The price is just right. \n\nCame in here with a group of 6 on a Saturday night around 7:00 PM and was seated within 5 minutes. Next came the complimentary bread- omg, probably some of the best sourdough bread i've ever had. The bread was warm, the inside was soft and the outside had just enough of chewiness and crunch. Our group ordered the lettuce wrap, the pizza, the salmon and chicken terriyaki, the fettucini alfredo and another pasta dish. Eveyrthing was delicious and none of us spent more than $15 dollars each(with tax and tip already) - not to mention we all had leftovers for after-clubbing grub at 4 AM. \n\nTo top it off, the service was awesome. Our waiter was honest with us about the portion sizes and encouraged us to share- not like the typical waiters that roll their eyes when they know you are sharing. He also offered to split all of the checks for us and even went above and beyond to split the shared items among the pairs. There was a 18% gratuity charge on our check but almost all of us left him extra tip because he was so awesome!!!! \n\nThanks Grand Lux Cafe for a great meal!!! I'll definitely be back. \n\nOh, they are also open 24 hours i believe :)"

Ordered spicy ginger beef and it was AMAZING. Came with veggies and choice of rice. Very well seasoned and not too much soy. Veggies balance out the amount of salt. I tried some of the chicken and waffles, while sober keep in mind, and it was literally the best chicken and waffles experience of my life. I had the same dish at founding farmers in Washington D.C. and was pretty disappointed. The bread is also warm and served with a huge square of butter, im talking quarter of the whole stick huge. Server was very attentive and kept the table updated when the food took a little long to come out. Refilled water multiple times and made sure we got all the bread we can eat.

The sour dough bread with vinegar and olive oil is a great appetizer to start off with and it's free. This place is owned by Cheesecake Factory, but it's a step up in quality and price. \n\nPositives: \nThe appetizers are just as good as an entree lol . We had some shrimp and fried calamari. The fried calamari came in a huge portion and it really filled us up. We didn't even finish it. \n\nThe entree that I had was Fish and Chips. I know that you can never go wrong with Fish and Chips, and I was right about the quality of it. It was 4 nice big pieces of Alaskan Cod with fresh hot fries. Their Buffalo Wing Chicken wrap is good too. \n\nNegatives:\nIt did take quite a bit of time for our food to come, but they did come at one time. My brother's filet mignon was kinda well done rather than medium like he wanted, but they did offer to take it back and re-do it but we were in a hurry. The price is what it is in terms of a fancy restaurant, but hey, it's Vegas and you want to eat like kings. \n\nAside from the negatives, I still give this place 5 stars for the quality and service. We were never left in the dark in terms of needing service from our waiter. There are only 3 Grand Lux Cafes in the country, so they do have good standards and quality."

Julius had the chicken and waffles, which he thought were good, but preferred the soul food variety (ie regular instead of Belgian waffles, and chicken wings & drumsticks instead of just strips.)\n\nOur food did arrive much later than everyone else's around us, and the manager was nice enough to come by to apologize.

We tried eggs, potato hash, creamy spinach and cheese dip(my favorite), seared rare ahi, avocado and heirloom tomato salad, and the grand club sandwich. \n\nThe creamy spinach dip was the best and so was the grand club sandwich. The eggs were great too. \n\nI didn't like the seared rare ahi. It was wasn't very fresh. I guess that's what you get for ordering sushi in Vegas at a breakfast place!\n\nThe salad was refreshing, but just make sure you like the dressing. It's best to request it on the side!\n\nI liked that there were lots of options for everyone. Breakfast ends at 11!"

I have no idea- but I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was a horrible mishap and carry on (ASSUMING THERE WOULD BE COMPENSATION AND AN APOLOGY OF SOME SORT). We'll I assumed wrong. We went on with our dinner (I got the Gnocchi which was inedible and aside from all of that, I had dried food on the inside of my glass). \n\nGot the bill and we were charged for everything. Our server was very nice and sent the manager over. This guy, however, was a joke. He was extremely defensive and rude. He was annoyed by the entire thing and gave a lot of attitude. I'm sorry but I just drank BUGS ate YOUR restaurant. You could at least comp ONE beverage. He grumbled, walked away without saying anything to us to resolve it.

Place was a little hard to find because the signs at the Venetion/Palazzo weren't too helpful. Even though the casino was packed there was no line when we went in so we were seated almost immediately. The waiter forgot to bring us bread so we didn't get any until after our main courses arrived. I ordered the Sunday night pasta, which is basically spaghetti but with steak and short ribs in it instead of ground beef. Don't get me wrong it was pretty good, but not really something I would pay $15 dollars for. You can't really tell the meat is better since the pasta sauce has a stronger taste. My dad's dish, on the other hand, was excellent. He ordered the slow roasted short ribs and they were fantastic, full of flavor, juicy, and tender. This place really deserves 3.5 stars but I guess I'll bump it to 4 since the decor is pretty nice."

What carne asada fries are to drunks in San Diego and what Paisano's Pizza is to drunks in Hermosa Beach, Grand Lux is to drunks in Vegas.  \n\nThe beauty of this place though is that it is for classy drunks and not even for only drunks.  The food: perfection.  They have THE BEST Chicken Parm I've ever had. They use a number of different types of cheeses that add to the tastyness of it.  They also lighly bread the chicken making it more tasty.  Unlike other places where all you taste is fried batter.  You get the flakeyness and deliciousness of the breading here with the juicyness of the chicken.  Now let's move on to the next entree...shall we?\n\nIf you order Buffalo ______ at Grand Lux, it's a safe bet to be amazing.  Anything Buffalo is good here. Their buffalo chicken roll appetizers are some of the best appetizers I've ever had and their spicy buffalo chix sandwich just adds to the buffalo goodness.  Sometimes I order both and I may get a look from the waiter recognizing my buffalo filled meal, but all that subsides after the first bite.  Now to breakfast...\n\nI tried their breakfast buffet here for the first time 2 weeks ago, and it was $15.95 and it included juice.  Very good breakfast selection of eggs, bacon, omelette station, fruit, waffles, etc.  The only thing missing was pancakes.  What i did though was made a nice dessert out of the waffles by taking some hot waffles and adding some of the chocolate chips they have laying around and put a nice dose of whip cream on top.  And if I'm feeling good, add some fruit.  They also have hash browns, which were some of the BEST hash browns I've ever had.  They weren't dry at all.  It was just great.\n\nThe greatest part is that they have 6 cheesecake factory cheesecakes (b/c it is the same company) and a whole bunch of other awesome desserts that I am sadly usually too full to eat.  I can't recommend this place more!"

I think the only reason I didn't was the lack of insurance. \n\nBy 1pm the pain finally stopped. I slept it off but it ruined my vacation. All week my throat was burning in pain from the acid. I've vomited before in my life but never like this; it was horrifying. \n\nI called the restaurant where they tried to blame it on something else and used the phrase \"Well you didn't consult a doctor so how could you be certain it was caused by us\" oddly they said this before asking if I was okay! I hadn't eaten since 9pm the day before; it was the Lux. Someone in corporate relations left me a voice mail and I will update this review after I talk to them on the condition they do something.

The ambiance and service are pleasant and uninteresting, and the food is unmemorable.  I do take issue with there being no bathroom within the restaurant.  The space is huge, and I fail to see why you have to go into the casino to take a leak.\n\nThe good thing about Grand Lux is that the menu is varied to suit all tastes, including very young ones.  We split chicken and waffles, strawberry French toast, and pastrami hash and eggs.  Nothing stood out, and the waffles and French toast probably tended towards bad, but everything was edible.  Grand Lux is nowhere to go out of your way for, but if you're hungry and it falls in your path, there's nothing to avoid at all costs either."

I've been here four times and have had:\n\nCaramel Thai chicken - delicious, thick sweet caramel glave on top of chicken breast bites. It's a humongous plate that should be shared. The sauce is just amazing and the chicken is juicy. \n\nSpaghetti Carbonara: Real melting cheese silces on top, high quality bacon, perfect texture.. I've been to Italy and had the real deal and this is the same if not better\n\nGrilled salmon - as good as expected.. put a hint of lime on it and you're good to go\n\nI've had the breakfast platter (saugage, ham, eggs, etc) and it's very good too, but not that amazing nor unique (overpriced too).\n\nThe service is friendly and also make sure you get the smoothies. They're about $6 but worth it. Huge glasses of perfectly blended fruit, mango and rasberry are fantastic!"

Somewhat brasserie in design with gold garnish and heavy fabrics plus a \"patio\" on the casino floor it was moments to seven on a Saturday morning that our trio was seated overlooking the Venetian's lingering late-night revelers alongside the morning check-outs and with immense menus soon perused selections were made - a sweet and gluttonous affair slow to arrive and marred by slow refills as staff seemed to be idling into shift change.  Admittedly more than a little puckish when plates were delivered nearly forty-five minutes later it was with relieved but bemused smiles that the three of us first laid eyes on the constituents of our $80 affair and although what was ordered would have been better suited for a half-dozen, the majority of it was worth the wait - an aggressively spiced carrot cake loaded with nuts plus shredded coconut and some of the thickest custard-drenched French Toast I've found both amongst the city's best."

Everyone seemed to have the same idea as us and we must've waited half an hour for a table. We had a larger group though - of like 8 people. When we finally sat, I was already regretting picking food over sleep. When in doubt pick sleep always - just a tip. Haha. Anyways I wanted something light to settle my alcohol ridden stomach so I ended up getting the Zen noodles. Worse thing to get. Wow, I was hoping for halfway decent noodles but these were dreadful. The broth was thin and too lemongrass-y. The noodles were short and rough and the texture was almost too al dente. They put chicken in there and it's a bit rough and overcooked. At least they had the soy bean sprouts and lime and cilantro and all the other herbs on the side for me to add. I would day that was the most authentic part of my dish. And so overpriced at like $13. Crazy. I left unsatisfied and looking forward to just crashing. Other dishes looked ok like the flatbread pizza, sandwiches and breakfast. Yeah I just caution ordering such an Asian dish at such an American place."

ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES TO EAT IN VEGAS!!!\n\nI've been coming here for several years eversince a bellhop from Caesar's Palace recommended to me and my bestest gal pal one late night back when I was 21 yr old young buck. \n\n- Love the beautiful atmosphere (appropriately located in the Venetian)\n- Love that it is 24 hours (good for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or late night snack)\n- Love that is from the makers of the Cheesecake Factory (Lot of similarities)\n- Extensive menu (so much to choose from it can be overwelming)\n- Great food (Most of the dishes I've tried are pretty good)\n- Excellent food presentation (kinda that fancy smacy stuff that you get wooed by)\n- Good portions (wooh....don't think I've finished a whole meal)\n- Decent prices (avg meal range anywhere from $8 - $18)\n\n****BUT...I am tempted to give it 1 less star due to my experience the week before heading Vegas. I called to two seperate times to make reservations for a group of 20. I was put on hold for over 10 minutes and just hung up since I was so frustrated.\n\nNonetheless, due to convenience our group decided to still  eat there since we were staying at the Venetian over the weekend. When calling from the hotel room (making sure to emphasize I was a guest at the Venetian), I quickly got reservations and hardly waited. A bit shady.....guess that have high priority for hotel guests. Good thing to know in the future\n\nWhen we got there, we got a long table in the back where they usually have big groups. One long table and it was spacious and private for a bit. SERVICE was excellent. They had two waitresses serving us. So Grand Lux  I guess I forgive you just this once better not let this happen again ; ) ******\n\nJust to note: My friends ate here 3 times when in Vegas since it's the best deal around in the Venetian and still one of the nicest and most decently priced places on the strip.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY (AND AREN'T THAT INTO THE CHEESECAKE), YOU'LL LIKE IT HERE!"

But I should have known to stick to simple things (like fries) because Grand Lux is from the makers of Cheesecake Factory (of which I'm not a huge fan). \n\nI tried the Rustic Lasagna with Chicken. First of all, lasagna with chicken just sounds weird, but I thought, why not? It looked good when it came out, but it wasn't lasagna. It was cannelloni. Why not just call it what it is? It had the potential of being great -- meat, cheese (how can you go wrong with cheese?), spinach and mushroom. But, it lacked flavor!\n\nOther dishes I sampled:\nSalmon Three Ways -- It was dry and salty.\nCrispy Sesame Tofu -- The tofu and snap peas were good, but the Szechuan orange sauce was pure salt. Also, I'm not sure where the \"crispy\" plays a role."

Whether it's the atmosphere, the decor, the staff and the menu, these two are pretty much identical. \n\nIt's weird too, because as I entered the Venetian and was seeking for a place to eat that was affordable and quick (I had to head to the Blue Man Group show and only had one hour to eat), everyone told me that this Cheesecake Factory-like restaurant was around the corner. When they said that it was similar, I had no idea what I was in for and how much of a clone it really was. Stunning but neat.\n\nSo we proceeded to walk in and get seated and a very friendly waiter took care of us. We ordered some stiff drinks, 2 Scotchs, on the rocks. Then while my grandfather 'carbed up' with a clam pasta dish, I went for one of their big salads; in this case it was their Chopped salad - grilled chicken, bacon, tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado, egg and mixed greens. The whole thing was tossed in a vinaigrette. \n\nThe food came out from the kitchen in under fifteen minutes. The clam pasta dish according to my grandfather was very tasty and the clams very fresh. The salad was large and despite my best attempts, I could not finish it. The dressing complimented the rest of the ingredients well and I didn't feel heavy from eating it. The service was great and the prices were great as well.\n\nOverall this place is a nice addition to the Venetian. It provides reasonably good food at good prices and with good service. It's reliable and their menu is varied enough to satisfy all kinds of appetite. I didn't however find it to be as good as any Cheesecake Factory location I've been to. It's less tacky though which is a good thing."

The Brussels were sooooo good. They were crispy with bacon I believe. The steak had mushrooms! I'm a huge mushroom fan so that was nice. JBH ordered one of the pasta dishes. It was a tomato basil mozzarella pasta very simple and good! We did find a piece of hair in it.... the manger came by to apologize & handled it very well. I appreciated that. They offered us a salad or soup on the house and asked if we'd like a new dish. JBH liked the one he had chose so he just ordered the same thing. Oh yeah the pasta had grilled chicken! It was cooked quite well. I tend to not order chicken because places always cook it so dry! But not here that's for sue. I'd definitely come here to try something else. Their menu has many options & it was kindof hard for me to decide lol. This always happens to me."

It is open 24 hours, so I didn't really think it was going to be THAT great. After fumbling around the casino with our stomach lining stuck to the spine, we decided we will settle for this place, not knowing what kind of surprise we were in for.\n\nWe ordered Caprese Salad, and I ordered Chicken Parmasan. (I forgot what my guy ordered. uh oh =P) The caprese salad was probably one of my favorite caprese salads I've had in a while. Instead of getting a neatly cut tomatos and cheese, we were greeted with a bed of lettuce and chopped tomatos, smothered in cheese and excellent dressing. Oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Then the chicken parmasan. When I was ordering this dish, the server asked if I wanted the dinner size or lunch size. I ordered the lunch size, bit worried if I ordered enough food, but then this humongous chicken came out on top of spaghettini lighly tossed with tomato sauce. Oh man, it was probably one of the best I've had, but since it was so huge, I could only eat half of it. I wonder what the dinner size would look like, but I am sure it could be able to feed 2. \n\nWe came back home to LA after a lovely stay at the Palazzo. When we were passing by Beverly Center, then that is when we realized that they have another Grand Lux Cafe on the 1st floor of Beverly Center. Oh man, we are glad to know that we can get their food right at home. (Assuming they serve the same stuff)"

I believe this place is open 24 hours so you can come here anytime to satisfy your late night cravings. They have a huge menu, but it's heavy on the selection of pastas. I got the pasta carbonara if I remember correctly. It was good, but heavy on the cream, which might not have been the best idea, but I was too hungry to care at the time. The portions are huge and I could barely finish half. It was not that good the next day to say the least. The butter cream had solidified into a chunky rock-like state. I also tried the chicken and waffles, which was also good. The service here was very good as our waiter was helpful in suggesting my pasta plate. I guess it never hurts to be nice when your restaurant is located in a casino and you just hope you run into a lucky patron who is feeling generous. Unfortunately, I had just lost all my money a few moments earlier."

After doing a little research, I found out that Grand Lux Cafe was actually owned by the same owner as The Cheesecake Factory. Figures, because their decor is pretty identical.\n\nAnyway, their vast menu really gave me a headache. There was just too much to choose from. Shrimp scampi?! Barbecued pork sandwich?! Pasta with grilled chicken, tomato, basil, and mozzarella?! Enchilada?! They even had pho! It took me awhile to decide on the Madeira chicken, which was really good. It came with sauteed chicken breast with asparagus and mozzarella, topped with a mushroom-Madeira sauce. It was also served with a side of mashed potatoes. The chicken breast was surprisingly tender and the mashed potatoes were nice and creamy. It was pretty decent granted that it's a chain restaurant. I don't recommend that you get their pho though, my friend ordered it and it looked pretty gross. The bean sprouts and basil that was supposed to complement the pho were all wilted and browned. Pho would have been the last thing she would have ordered at an American restaurant, but she wanted some soup and there was nothing else soupy on the menu. \n\nOur waitress was polite, but she didn't come by our table often. It was completely understandable, as she had a lot of tables to tend to."

You could walk down the strip to one of those $5 steak-and-eggs places, or the $1 hot dogs, or you could stay in the hotel and go to the only restaurant that's still open.\n\nSo you make the obvious mistake.  It's not really a restaurant, it's actually a slightly-modified version of the Cheesecake Factory.  Any place that has the word \"factory\" in the name isn't a restaurant.  They're serving you something that might once have had something in common with food but was sent to a factory, fried and then frozen, and then shipped out all over the US to be heated up in microwaves.  They're serving you food that is actually worse than Hot Pockets.\n\nMy waiter was totally stoned.  I don't just mean a little stoned, I mean falling over himself and barely able to walk upright.  Everyone seated in his section kept on looking at each other and rolling their eyes at him.  He thought he was suave and pulling it off, and was so stoned that he never noticed the giggling from everyone who had to deal with him.  Even the busboy was making fun of him.\n\nThe food is just what you'd expect from a Cheesecake Factory: fried food in massive portions and completely lacking in flavor.  It's totally quantity over quality.  It has exactly two redeeming qualities: it's available at 2am, and it doesn't require you to leave the hotel.  But next time, do yourself a favor and walk down to get the $5 steak-and-eggs.  You won't hate yourself so much afterwards."

I ate here at least 3 times; the first time was at 3 AM on our arrival night. I ordered a club sandwich, which was pretty good on an empty stomach from my 5.5 hrs drive from LA to Vegas. I ordered the sandwich from the bakery because the line was long for the restaurant itself due to club goers. I was disappointed when the guy at the register told me that the wait time will be 40 mins. 40 mins for a sandwich! He was lucky I was hungry! \n\n     A few days later I grabbed some lunch from the bakery, I had ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and a Caesar salad. The pizza was really good and satisfying. The salad was fresh and the dressing was tasty. My friends had ate some lunch from the cafe about 30 mins earlier, when my boyfriend and I arrived at the suite we were luckily to have some of their calamari. The calamari is to die for!! It comes with an array of dipping sauces and in the mix of calamari - there are some pieces of zucchini. After bites and bites of calamari, it's refreshing to take a bite of the soft zucchini. It helps balances the taste of the calamari. Especially with fried foods, after a handful I'm usually sick of the greasy taste in my mouth. The calamari at Grand Lux is fried perfectly and keeps you wanting more. The portions of the food is pretty good too. \n\n     On my next Vegas trip, Venetian and Grand Lux are definitely on my hit list."

The food is good and this place always seems to be open!\n\nThe first time I came here, I was having lunch. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was good. It just was a lot of breading and a lot of bread to eat at once. The second time I came, it was after a party...so everyone in our party was looking for a late night fix. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet. It was pretty good.\n\nNothing TOO much to say here. If you have been to the Cheesecake Factory, it is pretty much just like that. it is a dependable place with tons of choices for everyone in your party."

I've never actually eaten here during regular dining hours and probably wouldn't recommend doing so since Vegas has so many other restaurants to offer. I usually get the shaking beef...I just wish they put in more beef and less onions.\n\nService tends to lag a bit but we've never had any real problems until last week when a hostess could not appropriately handle a simple seating request. She led us to a table outside by the casino, which was too loud and noisy for our tastes so we asked if we could be seated further inside (there's a big room in the back with plenty of empty tables, we've eaten there often enough to know this). She quickly retorted there aren't any available and we'd have to wait. Uhm, what? You didn't even bother to check! We agree to wait for one, so we follow her back to the front and my boyfriend asks her how long the wait is...but she simply shrugs her shoulders and rudely turns away to chat with the other hostess. Meanwhile, we're sitting there waiting for almost 10 minutes being completely ignored, as we see 4 different small parties being seated...a few of which were led directly to the back dining room where we requested to be. WTF. When we were finally seated, we notice that the party who came after us was seated at a big comfy booth while we were stuck at one of the tables with the most foot traffic. This peeved the BF so much that he felt obligated to speak to the manager, who understood our concern and apologized profusely, even throwing in a free bag of cookies. Anyways, moral of the story is if you can't be friendly to a customer and make them feel welcomed, you probably shouldn't be a host or hostess at a restaurant."

I was impressed when we dropped in for a late breakfast/lunch Saturday afternoon. Located smack in the middle of The Venetian, the line was out the door. Luckily, we only waited about 5 minutes before being led to a table. \n\nRumor has it that Grand Lux is affiliated in some respect to The Cheesecake Factory. I'm not sure if that's totally accurate.. Whether or not that's true makes no difference to me because I am a Cheesecake Factory fan!\n\nAt any rate, I opted to be good and order a Turkey Club Sandwich. Unfortunately, I also acquiesced to their offer of a bread basket. The bread was nice, reminiscent of Cheese Cake Factory bread. It was damn delicious. My Turkey Club was also nice. It had fresh tomato and thick cuts of bacon. Bread was chewy and perfection. \n\nMy lunch companion opted for the breakfast buffet for $18. They will cook you a custom-made omelet. Hash browns, sausages, bacon, pastries and scores of other goodies are also available. Likely a good deal, especially if you have a good appetite and want multiple servings. But I was trying to be good, and was happy with my Club Sandwich. Although, admittedly, my lunch companion brought me a side of hash browns from the buffet. So, in retrospect, I guess I wasn't really that good.\n\nOverall, very pleased. Cost is very reasonable, especially considering it's a restaurant located in a Vegas hotel. I would certainly come here again."

I love this place, huge 25ft + ceilings, dim lighting and a rich, tastefully decorated dining room.\n\nThe food was wonderful, all eight of us were enjoying every morsel and the prices were quite resondable for the quality.  I had the chicken Madeira which is such a savory delight - I would recommend it to the pickiest of eaters.  It comes with rich, creamy mased potatoes and perfectly grilled asparagus.\n\nWe were all eyeing the desserts but no one dared to take the plunge because we had a long night of dancing ahead of us.\n\nOnly minor complaints - first our waiter spilled part of a pomegranite martini down the back of my freinds dress - good thing for him the dress wasn't white... could you imagine!  And for some reason the floors were super slick, it was like someone had waxed them with Crisco.  I kid you not, you had to hold on to something to keep from slipping.  Whoops! I smell a lawsuit.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  A superb restaurant for just about any occassion.  If you're a first timer go for the specialty items, you're sure to find a new favorite dish."

It's a short walk away from all of the conference chaos and we were seated immediately. I began with an icy peach Bellini, which was champagne and peach liquor blended together smoothie-style. It was tasty - not too strong. I'm used to being able to get in and out of most restaurants in Indy in 45-60 minutes and grew impatient at times with the slow service in Vegas, which routinely took 75-90 minutes no matter where you went. If you're anywhere on the strip, every restaurant worth eating at is packed, so plan in advance for it. Make reservations when you can. I ordered the pasta carbonara, which included bacon, peas, and garlic in a parmesan sauce for a reasonable $15.95 - the cheapest lunch I had all week. You could add chicken for $4 more, but I knew I was going to Fogo de Chao in a few hours for dinner so I declined that option. You could also get this dish gluten-free. It included a small salad and bread appetizer. The dish was excellent - one of two surprisingly authentic and delicious Italian dishes (minus the pancetta) I had during my stay in Vegas. The menu has a lot of options so everyone should be able to find something to suit their tastes. I don't recall the waitress's name, but she was helpful and attentive.

Sure it sounds like it's made-to-order, but really, at this volume of people they should already anticipate the demand.\n\nI ordered the Caramel Banana Pecan French Toast, but requested the Caramel on the side. They forgot to do that, so it was drenched with extra sweetness. Also disappointing was the serving size. The french toast was so THICK that it was more like bread pudding in the center. What a waste of food, but great for my waist. The waitress offered to take it back but I didn't want to have to wait longer for edible food. And how were they going to correct it?\n\nThey were prompt to seat, and prompt for coffee and water refills."

It's a great option for meal to soak up all the alki after a long night of partying or gambling. The food portions are rather big, I haven't been disappointed once. Price point is really reasonable, around $15 a plate depending on what you get. The service and ambiance is warm and cozy. It's not a super fancy upscale date, break the bank kind of place. Great for families and large group of friends to kick back and enjoy a good meal. They do get busy during peak hours but there is Bouchon bakery around the corner, you can get a little snack as you wait, or play the slots."

My friend and I were seated immediately upon entering, and we got straight to ordering. I ordered a chocolate espresso martini to start followed by the asian nachos as an app and the chicken and waffles for my entree. My friend went with the chicken parm. Our server was really nice, and made sure coffee/ water was always full.\n\nIf you like vodka, I would recommend trying their martini- that thing was strong! I switched to coffee and poured it in about halfway through. Asian nachos were great- fried wontons with rice, cheese, chicken, and two different yummy sauces on them. Entrees arrived soon after, and oh man, they were huge! There were probably 6 chicken strips on my waffle and my friend's chicken parm was easily the size of his 14 inch oval platter. Both meals were well rec'd- I took home the majority of my food (thank goodness for mini-fridges!). My friend said this was his favorite meal of our entire trip. So yes, more expensive version of The Cheesecake factory. So what's wrong with that? Absolutely nothing :)"

I ended up coming here for food time and time again. \n\nI drive past the location at the Beverly Center all the time and never once thought about going to eat here. Well, I dove in and was pleasantly shocked. The food was all delicious from the appetizers and full meals I ordered along with all my guests. We loved it so much we came back twice more during the week. \n\nThe place is open 24 hours, always has cute hostess (no servers I found), has reasonable prices for Vegas Casino inflation, and has huge portions. The bread they bring your table isn't shabby either and one thing is guaranteed that you will walk out of here feeling like you just tackled every item at a Vegas Buffet. \n\nThe concept here is to put you on the brink of a food coma so you plant yourself at a roulette game after eating and you just play for hours because you cannot move. \n\nThe only thing that stopped this place from going 5 star is the slow service. The place is always busy so if your in a hurry to dine then steer somewhere else. If you have a minute to kick back and recycle some energy then this is your place."

The menu is large and something for everyone with sandwiches and burgers, pastas, and hearty entrees with meat and potatoes.  I decided on the chicken salad sandwich and salad.  The sandwich was packed with chicken, 2 slices of tomatoes on each sandwich half and lettuce.  It was one of those open wide type sandwiches. The dressing on the salad was delicious and I devoured the salad quickly. \n\nThe others in my party were happy with their meals and the portions are large for a reasonable price.

The most convenient thing ever especially in Vegas.\n\nEating food after a night in the club is a definite must to let all the alcohol sink in.  The food here was absolutely amazing too.  Or was it only amazing because I was drunk?  No, it really was amazing.  Since I stayed at the Palazzo, I was reasonably close, and came here to eat for a meal for like 3 days in a row, and it was always delicious!  Meals also come with complimentary bread and butter..the bread was always warm, and very soft in the center. Yum.\n\nA few things that I tried...and loved\n\nShrimp Scampi Pasta $20\n\nThis came with HUGE pieces of shrimp and the pasta was extremely tasty..the cream in the pasta was not too overwhelming and they put in just the right amount so that the pasta was not swimming in pasta sauce.  The serving for this dish was huge..we split it among 3 girls and it was perfect.\n\nGarlic Shrimp Pasta $19\n\nAlso delicious, but similar to the shrimp scampi pasta...size of shrimp was considerably smaller..also came with fresh heirloom tomatoes, and some asparagus.  Over all, a very delicious meal. \n\nChicken and Avocado Salad lunch portion $12\n\nVegetables were super fresh, the dressing that came on the side was very tasty, and serving for extremely large.  A healthy meal to counter all the alcohol that was consumed the night before.\n\nThe only downside of this restaurant would be the fact that the wait time for the food was a little bit on the long side, but besides this..it is definite a great place to eat food for any time during the day."

We walked in and waited 5 minutes because no one was in the front and then we got seated. The waiter took a while to come and get or order and took a while  to just get water. \n\nMy bf got a lunch special which is the miso salmon, white rice and mushroom and vegetable side. It was really good!\n\nI got clam linguini. It looked good but it didn't taste good. It was bland and oily. I had to ask our waiter who took forever... (the staff like disappeared when i was looking for them.... no one was around) for some parmesan and red pepper flakes... i had to literally flavor the linguini with the parmesan which has a salty flavor and red pepper flakes to give it some flavor.\n\nSo, this place interiorly looks nice but their food and service needs improvement and the price is moderate. But, I am willing to try another dish (in LA) because this place is related to Cheesecake Factory and I think their food is good but I just had a bad dish."

My fianc\u00e9 was trying to grab her attention politely, she whizzed past him. It was at least another 5 minutes before she came around our way. We asked her if we could have some bread while we waited. It seemed like it took her a moment to process what we were asking her. Then it took another 10 minutes for it to come out. Another 10 minutes later, we were trying to find her since we wanted some refills. No joke, she disappeared for AT LEAST 15 min. Wtf, who does that? We had to ask a busboy to get us refills, which he graciously grabbed for us. Finally her slow bum came running out, and the busboy was trying to tell her that he had to get our stuff and for her to check on us. She runs over and says \"oh sorry for the wait! Your food should be out any minute!\" \n1. We werent concerned/bitching about our food\n2. We could clearly see the food coming out right behind her. \n\nAfter we get our food she had the nerve to \"check on us\" by walking by our table, looking over and saying \"oh you're good. Very good\" Woman, why don't you stop and ask us. Final straw  was when she brought our bill 10 min after we got our food without asking us about dessert. Not that we were going to get dessert, but still. Part of your Job is to ask. \n\nIcing on the cake: We walked out with the intention to talk to a manager. We saw what looked like 2 of them talking to each other, not caring about us walking out. AND the hostess wasnt paying any attention and didn't bother to de-greet us.\n\nThe place was not busy at all, nor was it late. It was lunchtime! \n\nI doubt I'll give this place another chance, especially if she's there."

I had ordered a to-go entree salad 20 mins before I knew I would be at the restaurant. When I arrived I went to the bar to pick it up. There were 3 bartenders working, I believe 1 was in training. After I want to say maybe 7 minutes the trainee came over to me I told him I was picking up an order. He then went to the back to pick it up came out maybe 4 minutes later handed me the salad and I proceeded to hand him my debit card. I checked the salad just in case to make sure it was the right one, kale and avocado salad w/chicken, and it was wrong. Mind you this is 30 minutes after I had placed the order. I let him know it was incorrect, he apologized and went back to the kitchen and brought it back out after another 4 minutes. He said it was the right salad just with not enough kale. I told him no, that I have ordered it many times before and it's an all kale salad with absolutely no romaine in it. He said well that's not what the chef told me. I told him trust me I've had it before so I know what I ordered. He took it to the back and I proceeded to wait another 10 minutes. I've now been in the restaurant 30 minutes for a SALAD after giving them 20 minutes head start. He came out and said the manager would be bringing it out. Finally he brought it out, apologized for the miscommunication and charged me not even full price but more than what I have ever paid for it in the past because they charged me for the wrong salad! I was so shocked that the manager was taking any kind of payment at all that I just gave it to him. So upsetting because I realized when I opened it yet again when I finally sat down to eat it, that it was still not the right salad. Unbelievable \nPlease work on how to handle this situation, not the best example for a new trainee. Cannot believe I paid for a salad I ended up not even eating because after all this the chicken wasn't cooked all the way through. Thanks grand lux"

We came in for breakfast and made sure to come on the earlier side since from previous experiences the line gets long fast.  For breakfast they have a buffet option for $16.99 or you can order from the menu.  For kids the buffet was $9.50 and since one of mine is only 2 years old she was free.  So two kids buffets for $9.50 total is a deal that can't be beat.  I had the chicken and waffles which is a heart attack waiting to happen but was very good nonetheless.  I will definitely be back since the food is good and the servers are attentive and friendly."

            "review": "If there's a book on how to run a large restaurant efficiently, serve decent food in a nice atmosphere, and get the orders right, then these folks wrote that book. Even though it's a large establishment inside a casino, the waiters don't treat you like you're a tourist at Disneyland.\n\nThere are, in fact, multiple Grand Lux cafes, with identical menus -- one  inside the Venetian and one at the Palazzo (the two casinos are seamlessly connected). And there's also a mini G.L. serving coffee and pastry.\n\nThis is a great option when you're looking for reliably good food served quickly -- but not in the mood for a) the food court, or b) a high-dollar, celebrity-chef inspired, fine-dining \"experience\". I ate at Grand Lux twice this weekend (once at V and once at the Palazzo), and the service was exceptional. For breakfast I had the best French toast I've tasted in a long time -- not too soft, gooey, or sweet (made with Brioche). (I rarely go out for breakfast, but for this place I'll make an exception; so many places seem compromised at breakfast, like everything is being done by the B team, which I suspect it probably is.) At lunch, I had the chicken enchiladas (available in two portion sizes -- the lunch consists of two smallish enchiladas, plenty of food unless you are really hungry). The sauces were spicy and flavorful -- a nice dish and only about $11. Hubby had the appetizer-portion Greek salad, also good, and quite substantial. We had a side of fries, and they were good. \n\nThe staff made sure our water glasses were filled, not making us feel rushed, and the time we spent there was exactly right (they keep the music up *really* loud to keep those tables turned... but in a nice way). Compared to the iffy service and cramped quarters at the Tintoretto bakery / cafe near the Grand Canal Shops, this place is a Godsend."

I would have to request the refill each time. Additionally, there was no \"check back\" once our food came out. If you wanted anything additional, you'd have to ask for it. They were quick to put your bill in front of you (which was nice); however, I'd place my card on top the check, and it would set there for 30 minutes before I had to request the bill to be paid. Also, another server brought us our entrees. I requested for some additional items (silverware, ketchup, etc) and none of the items were brought. I had to flag down our inattentive bartender to obtain the items, which I got 8 minutes later. There were many other issues as well, but I will stop here."

In fact, he only brought the check because my boyfriend yelled and got his attention.  THEN, it took a while for him to bring us the check and return credit cards.  We were all pretty irritated.\n\nVARIETY: 5/5.  Lots of late-night options, which we appreciated.  Everything from burgers to omelets to desserts.\n\nFLAVOR: 4/5.  Pretty good.  I enjoyed my winter vegetable soup, the beignets were deliciously fluffy (though I thought the sauces were unnaturally sugary and preservative-laden), and the burger was flavorful and well-cooked.\n\nVALUE: 4/5.  Considering it's Vegas, not too bad.  My soup was around $5, burger around $13.\n\nIt's a good thing I waited 2 days to cool off before writing this review...

Grand Lux is a small chain with restaurants in places like Miami and Houston, a deluxe version of the Cheesecake Factory with a giant menu including European, American, and International Fare. The smoothies are good. They have lots of sandwiches and pasta and breakfast all day and mexican and practically everything else. This place is giant and actually has two locations in this casino. The location is nice. I think it may be the original for the chain. You will have a more unique experience perhaps if you spend $60/person at a fine dining place on the strip but you cannot do that every night and Grand Luxe is great food for the price (especially for the strip) and everything will be quite good. For a similar price you can visit one of the many trendy diners in the strip casinos but not get the whole tablecloth experience and you will end up with more fried food and less sides and variety. You can also go to a buffet but that will be a bad move, as the food quality will be lower than Grand Luxe, and you will end up too full when Grand Luxe would definitely have offered more than enough food anyway without the temptation to eat 3 plates of low quality food to get your value."

For all your alcoholics out there (particularly from California), don't front - you know y'all head to Denny's or Jack In The Crack or Mel's because really junky, greasy food tastes even better at 3am and when you're trying to sober up.  Well, the food at Grand Lux Cafe is several notches above Denny's, Mel's and Jack In The Crack.  AND, this place is open 24:7.  Even better.  You can stumble into the restaurant looking like a complete train wreck, missing one shoe and tiara in hand, at 3am, 5am or 7am!

The Brussel sprouts that were with the meal were just the shavings of the outside layer without the meat of the whole veggie. Overall a satisfying meal.\n\nChicken pot pie - a large portion ( could share with another person ). The inside of the pot pie must have a white wine base with the layers of flavors. The inside of the pot pie was almost like a savory chicken stew with big chunks of moist chicken, potatoes and veggies. The flaky topping was also an enjoyable experience for the taste buds."

I came here for a late night dinner at 11:30 pm with my boyfriend because we wanted some pasta. This was just one of the few places that were open late. \n\nFirst of the hostess was not very welcoming. I never really pay attention to stuff like that but I came a long way from walking around the grand canal shoppes. I was ready to get seated.  One waiter got our drinks right away and ten minutes later a nice waitress took our order.  We ordered crispy calamari, the beef wellington and shrimp scampi. \n\nThey gave us a basket of bread and butter. Of course I dig right in. This bread was the worst bread I have ever had. Do not get me wrong, the flavor was there but the crust of the bread was so tough! I could barely chew it! It seemed like old bread that has been reheated. \n\nThe calamari was a 30 minutes wait but it was good. Not the best I have had but good.  The main entrees took another 30 minute wait. I was a bit agitated at this point but I was happy about how the food looked.  \n\nThe shrimp scampi was okay.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the shrimp was yummy!  The sauce on the pasta was way too sour.  I was not a big fan and neither was my boyfriend. \n\nThe beef wellington had a side of rainbow carrots, Brussel sprouts, and mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. It had a very good flavor but sadly it was way too salty. I couldn't finish eating the second cut of steak. I never usually complain about the dish but I could not take how salty it was. I was downing so much water because my mouth was getting dry. I was highly disappointed with my meal.\n\nI give one star for the kind waitress. The wait and food quality was not her fault whatsoever.  I give a second star because the sides on the beef wellington was really good! They were all cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were to die for.  And the shrimp on the pasta was also delicious.  \n\nI'll give another try one day but hopefully they improve the food quality."

And the manager on duty was just as terrible, if not worse. Let me tell you why. \n\nNow don't get me wrong, my boyfriend and I have ALWAYS loved dining here in the past. But this time around, I don't know what it was that changed but we certainly left HATING the place.\n\nWe came in on a Wednesday night. \nMy boyfriend and I were seated and we found our initial server to be quite awkward and seemingly uninterested in obtaining our orders. After about 20 minutes of waiting he finally comes around and tells us they were undergoing a shift change and asked if our new server had been around yet. Nope. Nothing yet. But that's fine, should be understandable given the shift change, right? He then takes our orders before he leaves.\n\nSo our initial server leaves and we literally waited another 30 minutes before our food came out, and it wasn't until 10 minutes after that some lady decides to finally come and ask how everything is tasting. I'm sorry... but who are you? Oh that's right... you must be our server? \n\nAt the table across from me I observe a lady and her husband getting just as irritated with the lack of service from our same waitress and elapsed time waiting on their food.\n\nFast forward all of the ridiculous waiting and our almost non-existent server, she finally comes around to give us the bill. I had never been so irritated with such service or the lack of in my entire life, and I am usually the patient one between my boyfriend and I (might I add, we also used to be servers too).\n\nSilly me, I decide to take it up to the manager as we are leaving... And he could not be any less disinterested! Sierra comes along to see what's going on (because I'm SURE she knows what crappy service she delivered) and as I begin to complain she just gives me that \"I don't have time for this\" look and is dismissed by her unapologetic manager. \n\nHe showed no remorse, whatsoever. All I did was complain about the lack of service and a simple apology would have sufficed. My boyfriend and I have BOTH been servers in the past. I don't care if you're having a bad day, you're just slow as heck, or running behind... You still say SORRY.\n\nNow I don't know if the manager just didn't take me seriously since I didn't wear my \"big girl\" pants and heels that night (maybe he thinks I'm just some child trying to get comped for a meal, who knows??). But as a current nurse and past waitress I would like to see how he would feel if he were my patient/customer complaining about his issues and I just stared at him blankly with no remorse or reaction.\n\nBut anyway... vent session, over lol.

Our favourites were the creme brulee (I'm a huge creme brulee lover, so getting to try two was pretty nice) and the beignets, which were amazing. \n\nIf I were specifically looking to go out, I might not choose this, but when we were headed back from the casino or the club, or just looking for something to eat nearby, it was a trustworthy option."

Famished beyond belief and very dehydrated, we arrived ready to eat!  I ordered the chicken and waffles, expecting the best chicken and waffles of my life because the menu description made it sound ritzy.  Honestly, it was disgusting -- dry chicken coated in batter that was still gooey inside, a flavorless dry waffle, and synthetic tasting syrup and melted butter.  Even I in my disorganized stupor could not allow myself to finish this meal.  You're MUCH better off at Denny's in the early morning."

It goes without saying that the deserts are sensational, but the dinner menu is just brilliant. They have two menus - the 'Skinny' menu (appropriately in a skinny format) if you're after healthier options and a regular menu. As others have said - very refreshing to have the option given that there are not a lot of veges involved in most fast food joints (potatoes being the main exception in the guise of fries of course!). We were surprised at the extensive range of things to choose from as well as the really very reasonable pricing. The hard part was trying to decide what to have! I had the fresh-made guacamole and it was hands-down the BEST I've ever had. My gf had Tuscan chicken off the skinny menu and he loved his as well. Servings are generous without being over the top. The atmosphere was great, nice little booths and they seemed to cater really well to families and large groups as well having a glance around us. Bathrooms exceptionally clean. Can't recommend this place enough, would love to eat there again...if only we had one were we live!"

Very savory and delicious. (5/5) \n\n2. Fresh Garden Omelette: My order came with hash browns, white bread/jam! The omelette consisted of mushrooms, heirloom tomatoes, avocado, zucchini, spinach, Havarti cheese and sour cream. The omelette was very filling; I wasn't a fan of the tomatoes but everything else tasted great. The hash browns were so good! (5/5)\n\n3. Rib Eye Steak: My bf loves his protein and meat. The steak was delicious and you get your choice of mashed potatoes or veggies. He opted for the mashed potatoes and OMG there were mountains of mashed potatoes on his plate! The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and flavorful, yum! (5/5)\n\nOverall, the portions here are big.

The meat was perfectly cooked or not cooked depending how you look at it.

Have you ever been to one of those places where the cost is just above the price for casual food, and the food has such high aspirations that it ends up falling flat? Well this isn't that place. You pay a little more at the Grand Lux Cafe, but you get a lot more in terms of food, service and atmosphere. \n\nThe servings here are gynormous. Yes, gynormous. The fried calamari was delicious, especially with the shrimp mixed in, and honestly would have been filling enough to call it a light meal for two people. The BLT was huge, with heaps of crisp, delicious bacon finding their way straight to my heart (and hips). One person in our group got a deli sandwich and asked how much meat it came with. After asking to leave half of it off, she still could barely fit the sandwich in her mouth. And the fish and chips? Let's just say there would have been enough for about 2 and a half meals. \n\nThe service was great as well, friendly, unpretentious and quick.

We waited about twenty minutes until we flagged down another waitress and we just asked for the check. We express our disappointment with the service, we paid the bill and left. This was my first time at the Grand Lux ever, I've been to the Cheesecake Factory plenty of times. The service sucked it at least out waitress did!!  This is Las Vegas, there service should be impeccable no matter where you are!! This location needs to step it up, your guys thrive on tourists! When I go back to Vegas, I will definitely avoid this establishment!!"

The last five we almost always stay at the Venetian and the Grand Lux Cafe has become our favorite place to eat.\n\nMind you, we in no way ignore all the great steak house near the strip or in downtown, but for some reason we love this place. On one 3-day trip, we ate their six times. One day, we ate every meal there!\n\nWhat amkes this place so great? Its variety and the quality of the food. But there's a clincher for us. We always choose to dine in the patio area that overlooks the pathway between the casino and the elevators to the rooms and the stairways from the ballrooms because all the pretty gals in their evening dresses walk by past us. Good food, good friends and lovely ladies. What else could you ask for?!\n\nRegarding the food, GLC makes great burgers, awesome pasta and delicious NY cheesecake. One of my friends loves the jambalaya and another likes the orange chicken. Breakfasts are good as well, and their salads are tasty and bountiful. The iced teas are enormous. They taste unlike any other iced tea I've had and at first I didn't like them, but they've grown on me.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and obviously have eaten all the dishes because they never lack for enthusiastic recommendations when we ask.\n\nThe portions are quite large, maybe not Claim Jumpers huge, but still big enough to illicit groans from some in our group that they need to go up to the room and lie down. It's also a good thing the restrooms are directly across from the the restaurant. If you need to make room for desert you can just hop the fence and be back right as it's being served.\n\nIf you ever stay at the Venetian give Grand Lux a try. Sometimes the lines are long, but they move pretty quickly. Sit in the patio, relax and enjoy the scenery."

We were seated as soon as we walked through the door, and waters, and bread quickly came our way, which were much appreciated since we were famished. \n\nAfter a quick peek at the appetizer section of the menu we placed an order for some Buffalo Chicken Rolls, and by the time those suckers arrived we were able to decide what we wanted for our main course. I opted for the Lunch Special Pasta and Salad with the Pasta Telephono. But more on that later. The Buffalo Chicken Rolls (which came with 6 pieces) were crispy on the outside, and warm, gooey, cheesy, and buffalo-y on the inside. Plus they weren't too filling. So we had plenty of room for our entrees. \n\nJust as we polished off our appetizer, our lunch entrees arrived. And they were HUGE. The side salad was pretty standard. But the pasta was cheesy (notice a theme here?), well-cooked, and tasty. It was basically an adult mac n cheese. And it was so gigantic that I had enough leftover for a late night snack. \n\nAnd, best of all, the bill came to under $20 per person. It was so very reasonable, especially in Vegas where everything is overpriced. I suggest checking this place out: it'll give you the most grub for your buck (except for maybe a buffet)."

When my family came to meet me in Vegas, the first thing I said was, \"You have GOT to try this place.\" The only reason I'm writing a late review now is because I found an old receipt from the Grand Luxe and now I'm sad because I miss my Chicken Madeira. \n\nFirst, it's conveniently located within the hotel (for you guests) and not a far walk away from the meeting/convention rooms (for people like me). There was no wait the several times I went, although it was busy but the space is large enough to accommodate indoor seating and artificial outdoor seating (it's not technically outdoors because you're outside of the main restaurant but still within the walkways/slot machine of the hotel and people are walking by as you eat).\n\nAnyhow, let me tell you.. first let's start with the FREE bread.. my enemy. I love eating the inside soft part only and leaving the crust, and my colleague likes eating the crust and not the inside. Something for everyone.\n\nAs for the menu, everything is delicious.... except for this fish dish that was too lemon=y and I sent It back and ordered something else. I thought it was just me but my colleague ordered the same thing and sent it back also. They were gracious about it. The servers are all friendly. Maybe they hate you on the inside but they don't act like it on the outside. \n\nNext, the portions are HUUUUGE... Yes, it could cost $15-20 for some plates (my madeira chicken and pot roast were each $18.95 according to my receipt) but you could split it with 2 people or take it to go and it's totally affordable. I have a HEALTHY appetite and I would always have an actual half of my meal to go because it was so huge. That is always a plus in my book when I can eat until I'm about to burst and still have enough leftover to feed me for another meal.... \n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable. I'm looking at an old receipt and apparently my thai fried chicken was $12.95 and a kids mac n cheese was $5.95. Definitely reasonably priced. Considering the portions and quality, it is worth it. A large selection of comfort foods, pasta, Asian inspired dished with an American flare, etc... definitely something for everyone, including kids. This is like Denny's or IHOP's older, fancier, more handsome, brother...\n\nPlus you know a place is great when I ate there several days in a row and ordered something different every single time and still had a great experience... CANT WAIT TO PLAN A TRIP BACK TO VEGAS JUST SO I CAN EAT HERE AGAIN... LOL"

The bread was pretty good. My husband got a chicken caesar salad and the chicken has some fishy taste to it, and half of the lettuce was soggy. I didn't really like it. We had a Chicken Quesadilla and although it was good and tasty, it was really greasy. One thing I cant complain about was their desert... Creme Brule... it was pretty good!

What?  \n\nThe person who served our bread tossed the basket on our table.  It seemed very rude. I ordered the Shaking Beef and Caramel Chicken combination.  I asked the waitress how the beef was cooked.  She told me, \"It's supposed to be medium well but it's always cooked to well.\"   That was fine with me because I wanted it well done.  My dish came and some pieces were downright rare and a couple of pieces were cooked well.  But overall, a poor showing by the \"chef\".  The rice on my plate was dry and hard.  How do you mess up rice?? My daughter ordered the lettuce wraps.  Those used to be so good.  She didn't even eat it because there was no flavor.  Definitely, not what they used to be.

This is still a good example of this love affair but Los Angeles has several establishments where they serve a better one, Grand Lux's was slighly dry.  Nonetheless, it definitely hit the spot. :D\n\nAlso ordered the Asian nachos, which was my FAVORITE thing of the evening.  Made like regular nachos but with an Asian twist, and with Won Ton strips instead of tortilla chips which I feel is one of the more unique and impressive dishes I have came across in some time.  \n\nTheir grand Lux burger was also good but not everything my friends ordered came out as spectacular as say the Asian nachos.

Someone took the drink order; a different person took the food order.  Every single item was brought to the table by a different person.  You might think this would make it a very fast and efficient, but no.  I ordered the cream of chicken soup and a small chopped salad.  My partner ordered the smoked salmon platter.  We each had a drink.  When the food arrived the smoked salmon platter did not have a bagel as it should have.  I tried to flag down our waiter or any waiter and it was next to impossible.  Finally our(?) waiter arrived and we explained the problem.  Fifteen minutes later still no bagel and no sign of our waiter.  I got the attention of another waiter and explained the problem.  Ten minutes pass and no bagel and no waiter.  By now I'm getting agitated.  I manager comes over and I explain the problem of the missing bagel and missing waiter.  I also stated that I didn't think we should have to pay for the platter since we have now been there for over an hour.  He went to the kitchen to check.  The waiter then appeared and said the kitchen had no bagels but the manager was taking care of things. (No offer to reorder just more waiting).  Finally two hard as a rock bagels arrive.  As a \"courtesy\" the manager removed the charge for the $5.00 soup.(How generous)  We never saw him again.  The whole affair, from arriving at the table to check arrival takes nearly two hours! You bet I paid in cash so as not to have to wait for my credit card to come back.  I think the waiter tried his best.  The problem here seems to be TOTAL lack of management and total chaos in the kitchen.  It was 8:00pm and the place was half empty. The looked to be more than ample wait staff. Two hours for soup, salad and a lox platter???!!!\nThis place is totally mismanaged. The food wasn't even up to the usual Grand Lux standards. Stay away."

Solid plates served with panache but with a comfort food twist to it. Everything you get here is big, and tasty! Menu is large, and if you can't find something to eat here then you might as well just go get a candy bar. Plus, they have those great slices of cheescake made by the parent company.\n\nI love coming here for lunch and getting the half sandwich and soup special. Also comes with a salad. Great deal for $10, and you get more than enough on the plate to satisfy. Also, many salads, burgers, sandwiches and so much more to choose from. Decent prices for what you get here.\n\nPlus, the actual place is large and beautifully decorated. A lot of attention to detail went into the planning of this location. Another cool thing is to get a seat in the fake front outside patio area to people watch. Sometimes you can see a real freak show walk by here in Vegas where anything goes!"

I  yelped 24 hour restaurants in Vegas and the second one that shows up was this one. We arrived at 11:45 p.m this past Thursday and everyone from the hostess that answered our questions on the phone to the bus boy that gave us water was nice, professional, and attentive!! It's hard to find good food and excellent service during normal hours of the day let alone at midnight! Only in Vegas, I guess. Our waitress was so nice and gave us some suggestions on what clubs are hot at the moment. We loved it so much we went back the next night at around 10 p.m. (would've gone three days in a row, but no time!)and same deal except this time we noticed they offered chicken and waffles on their menu. GOURMET CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! TAKE THAT ROSCOES!! For dessert we got a dozen pecan chocolate chip cookies to go for something around $6.00 and they were made fresh!! You can't beat that!!\n\nGrand Lux is better than Cheesecake Factory! Trust, I went to one at Caesar's and everyone there thought they were too good to work there or threw their dirty laundry with other workers out in the open with us. Not classy. \n\n    I urge you not to waste your money or time on crap late night food cafes that over charge you for undercooked food and bad service. Grand Lux is better than Cheesecake Factory!"

The food was truly out of this world!!  I want to write an ode to the salted caramel syrup my cousin had with her chicken and waffles.  I mean, like in Gaelic. Hardcore.  We took some to go, and drank it for \"breakfast\" the next day.\n\nI had the Zen Noodles and all I can tell you is, it's some of the best \"pho\" I've had in awhile!   The lemongrass broth beats plain ol chicken or beef or veggie any day!  You can add the veggies (sprouts, basil, lime) and request the Sriracha (although it was in paste form, and I prefer the chili pepper sauce).  The noodles are big and flat, and I like how they bring you extra broth in a small carafe - aye! que cute!\n\nMy bestie had the chicken parm, and I'm telling you, the portions DON'T PLAY.  If we had been in the same moods, and not so tipsy, I would have shared.  As it were, we had parm the next day for lunch - BOTH of us.  \n\nI see there are nothing but 4's and 5's down the line for this place, so believe them!\n\nTIP:  Um, don't go SO drunk you can't enjoy it....and they're open all night (one of the few!)\n\nhttp://www.venetian.com/grand-lux-cafe-venetian.html"

I ordered the Caramel Chicken and it was pretty bland, essentially tasted like the honey chicken at Pei Wei (which I could have gotten for half the price) and was not in any way unique tasting or as delicious as it was made out to be.

Yes the food is good, but after something like this there's no way that the operation they're running in that kitchen meets the health and safety standards it should. \n\nIt started off well, the hostess was nice and quickly seated my party of 3. The waiter followed a couple minutes later to bring us water. We immediately ordered since we knew what we wanted before getting there. One of us had a Belgian waffle and coffee, and I split chicken and waffles with my other friend. He's allergic to nuts, and we didn't know there were pecans on top of the waffle so we had to send it back once we got the food. The waiter was accommodating and brought us another order without pecans about 15 minutes later. We also ordered a butter cake at this time. \n\nI was almost done with my half of the chicken and waffles when I bit down on something hard. I thought it was a chicken bone at first, which was odd because they were tenders. It turned out to be a small piece of metal, and luckily I didn't bite down hard or swallow it. It was large and sharp enough to really do some damage if swallowed. I immediately told the waiter and the manager came soon after. He apologized, said he will take care of it, and took the dish. When he came back he told us he figured out where it was from. He explained how the chicken was made in a wire basket that was really old, and the metal piece fell off of it while cooking. I respect the transparency, but really? You're telling me one of the most popular places inside a luxury hotel on the Strip uses broken wire baskets that carry this kind of risk. He was pretty nonchalant about it too, which was unsettling. How much of your cookware has life-threatening risks that you just tell that to a guest? If the manager is so casual about this, who knows what other safety hazards they have back there around your food.\n\nAfter the manager left we got our butter cake then the check. We were charged for 2 orders of chicken and waffles plus everything else, but only one of the orders of chicken and waffles was comped. We didn't touch that first order with the pecans so we called back the manager. He apologized and said it was the old bill and that the new one is ready at the register. And so he rushed off and got us the new bill, which had no charge for chicken and waffles. This seemed like a lie because why would the \"old\" bill charge us for 2 orders in the first place. Anyway we paid the new bill and left because at that point we just wanted to get out of there. We should not have paid for anything after such a terrible, potentially harmful experience."

It also came with salad which I decided to have the cream of asparagus instead!  It's quite cheesy and greasy and all around good.  Although not the best grilled cheese I ever had, it was the greasy spoon I needed after a long weekend of drinking ;) \n\nPASTA CARBONARA (lunch pasta & salad special) - $12.50\nSmoked bacon, peas, a touch of garlic and karma dan cream sauce! We chose the twisted pasta instead of spegetti.  The pasta portion is HUGE! Definitely share-able.  although I had to ask for extra sauce because it didn't seam enough.  Overall this dish was okay :)\n\nAs for the salad, I'm glad it didn't taste like regular typical house salad.  It had dressing and a lot of the veggies that were decent.\n\nMy overall experience here was ok.  I feel we came here for convenience; it was in our hotel and we knew it had a variety of choices to eat.  Service was unfortunately weird although she was nice, there were a few mistakes and miscommunication  I guess.  Grand Lux is a place more for convenience than being part of the Vegas experience."

Our waiter was super nice and he mentioned that his wife was also a waitress there and they worked the same shift; now that is love people. \n\nBack to the review. \n\nRight from the start the waiter told us that the portions were huge so if we did not eat a lot that we could get a lunch portion or might want to share.  The honesty was refreshing as in Vegas all everyone does is try to up sale. \n\nThe food was great. Me and the g/f split a pizza and the LUNCH/half portion Sonoma salad, delish.\n\nAs I said about portion size, we couldn't finish that and gave it to one of the many down on their luck people we say on the bridge. Funny thing is that when I gave the half pizza to the homeless couple, the woman looked right at me and said, thank you, god bless, but what I REALLY need is some matches.......you can eat matches?"

Potatoes, cheese, chives, bacon, wrapped in a flaky egg roll pastry and served with sour cream.  To die for.   We split the beef wellington as we know the portions there are huge and it was amazing.  On our next visit, we tried one of their pastas and pizzas.  Skip the pizza but everything else we had there was extremely enjoyable.\n\nThis place reminded me a lot of the Cheesecake Factory in terms of decor/ambiance and menu variety & length.

I think they have a decent menu for a cafe that opens until the wee hours of the morning.\n\n Our server was super busy (on Sunday @ 2AM), and was late bringing out our food, but the manager came and apologized for him and then offered us more food to tide us over, but we declined his kind offer.  I had the Max Burger and thought it was worth every penny.  What a giant mess!  I ate it in 2 meals. \n\nI know, I came to a cafe and ended up getting a burger anyway, which I could have gotten down the street at Sonic's, but I still maintain that this place is better than the other cafes.  \n\nI would definitely come back, considering the variety of options and non- fluorescent atmosphere and esp. the fact that you pay the same price, but get more for your money here."

HUGE, yes, but it is a 12 dollar burger so I expect either big in taste of huge, and Grand Lux gives you huge.\n\nI keep on eating here on every visit in spite of the lack of taste, just because it's so convenient  since I stay at this hotel, and the mood is inviting and nice but I am consistently unimpressed with the food.  It's Vegas.  Impress me.... and I give them all these chances, and still - -  they don't.\n\nCoffee is blaaah - as is the case with the entire hotel, and service is decent.  Nothin' to write home about.  For quick and easy eating - - Grand Lux Cafe is okay.  But your socks won't be knocked off, you won't come out moaning and groaning, you won't wonder when the next time you get to eat here will be, and it's definitely not one of those, \"I CANNOT WAIT TO GET HOME TO YELP ABOUT THIS PLACE\" type of restaurant.\n\nI uploaded some of the food photos I took here.\nBelieve me.  It looks better than it tastes.  :-)"

My fiancee and I decided to grab a quick lunch before our drive back home and settled on the Grand Lux. We were promptly seated and our server came with the menu. Given that we were hungry, we ordered an appetizer right away (fried calamari). Afterwards, it took our server (main server) quite some time to get back to us and get our main orders. We order the sunday pasta and the sausage pizza, thinking that whatever was left over we could just eat on the way as well. Let's start with the app. As soon as my calamari came, I noticed there were no lemons. I asked for the server who dropped off the food (server #1) if I could have some lemons. She said yes and went to get them. We never saw her again. Then, we asked a different server for water since our own server was nowhere to be found and thinking that server#1 would be coming back with lemon. We never saw server #2 (and #1). Given the lack of servers available, we then had to ask the host to please locate our server and explained to her that we had asked for water and lemons. The host explained that their calamari does not normally come with lemons but they would bring us lemons. Finally I got my lemons. The pasta and pizza also took some time to come, and I must say... they felt pretty greasy (even to two hungry people). Then we finally saw our main server, but by that point we explained that we were in a rush so we just asked for a to-go box for the rest and the check at the same time. We got the boxes first and we were waiting for the check to come. Overall, I have experienced better in terms of food and service. Prices were reasonable."

I've never been disappointed by the food that comes out of the kitchen, the service, or the view (last time here, saw Lebron James, Donyell Marshall and their posse). This appears to be one of the favorites of my close buddy and his family as well.\n\nThe Venetian hotel is known for it's 5 star service and decor, that of classic elegance. The name itself evokes thoughts of royalty and class. The restaurant almost always has a line, especially at night as this is one of the few restaurants open late night with a full palatable menu.\n\nEnvironment: the restaurant had the main dining hall, a couple side sections and the \"outdoor\" patio. All are very open with high ceilings so that you never feel crowded. Given that this is in the middle of one of the more popular hotels in Vegas, ambient noise is a given. We happened to sit on the patio which is still inside the hotel but enclosed by a 3 foot high antique gate. Perfect for people-watching especially because you have a great view of the hallway leading to Tao nightclub. The tables are a little too closely situated together (I coupe clearly hear the conversation of our neighbors) but you're never hitting elbows. If you're a larger person, request the booth seating because the chairs are designed for people with a BMI of 25 or less.\n\nWaiter/waitresses: she made several trips to our table to make sure we were enjoying our dinner. Every time she came by, she had a smile on her face. Our water cups never went empty nor did our bread basket. Overall, impressive service and something you'd expect at a more intimate 4-star restaurant.\n\nFood: I just learned that this restaurant is owned by Cheesecake Factory. That explains the decor, bread, an much of the menu. The bread basket contains freshly baked honey wheat and sourdough. The crust is crunchy and flaky while the middle of the loaf is soft and chewy, the perfect consistency for bread. The honey aspect of the wheat bread is not overpowering but adds jut a hint of sweetness to enhance your appetite and clear your palate for the entree. For the main course I had the crispy caramel chicken. Basically, it's fancy orange chicken which is served with a medley of vegetables marinated in the sweet and spicy thai sauce covering the chicken as well ad a generous helping of either brown or white rice. The chicken's crust was a little thick, making it difficult to chew. The chicken itself was on the drier side and the sauce a little too sweet. In fact, the dish was more sweet than spicy. If that suits your taste, you may want to check this dish out.\n\nDrinks: just water.\n\nRecommendation: EAT!!!"

You can eat some and take home some to eat later. The smell is so rich, and they bring them right out of the oven already nicely packed in a box. I brought some back to my hotel, but the cookie monster ate my leftovers the next day. :( I was sooooo sad... a little consideration would've been nice. I guess the cookie monster really liked them. I was SOOOO looking forward to eating one the next day.\n\nOnly gave them 4 stars because I'd have to go back to try something else off the menu worth raving about besides the cookies. Oh yeah, their cafe latte is EXCELLENT with the cookies. No sugar needed if you have the latte w/ the cookies. It's a nice balance."

It's owned by The Cheesecake factory and it's very similar to the Cheesecake Factory. However, they have better food here. It's really good. Here are some of the items that I have tried that I highly recommend:\n\n1. Thai Chicken Pizza (very nicely done)\n2. Grand Lux Burger Melt (you haven't had a burger until you try this)\n3. Southern Fried Chicken (melts in your mouth)\n4. Southwestern Salad (excellent)\n\nI'm docking them a half of a star because every time I come here prices seem to rise.\n\nI have always had excellent service at this location and enjoy dining here. The Venetian is a great hotel in Vegas and this restaurant is an added plus. This place is really good and every time I visit Vegas I make it a point to eat here.\n\nHighly recommend!"

This thing was 2 pieces of bread, arugula, turkey, and bacon. Uhmmmm LAME! The fries were good, but I wasnt pleased with my sandwich. I left irritated and will probably not go back!!

            "review": "Honestly, The Grand Lux Cafe is one of my top five favorite restaurants and has held this prestigious honor since it opened up.\n\nHere is my top 10 list as to why The Grand Lux Cafe deserves the honor:\n\n10. The menu is huge. If you can't find something that you utterly enjoy on it, go back to McDonald's.\n\n9. The wait staff is always accommodating. You can substitute things and it will still come out the exact way you asked, on the first try. ( I have a picky mother-in-law and there are ALWAYS substitutions when she orders her meals)\n\n8. If you are lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar and want to eat there, they set you up right with all serving utensils and place mat. Plus, you get your drinks faster, score!\n\n7.Seating. We never have a bad table, and comfy seats.\n\n6. Plenty of tables. When a restaurant is as popular as this one, they need lots of tables and The Grand Lux Cafe has plenty. I have yet to wait over 10 minutes  for a seat, even on a holiday weekend.\n\n5. Artichoke Dip. This is my favorite appetizer ever and the Factory does it well. Spinach, artichokes, cheese=Heaven.\n\n4. Avocado Egg rolls. Really, I have no need to say more.\n\n3. Cheesecakes! In every flavor imaginable. And they all rule! They even have sugar-free ones for those of us that can't have sugar. Yes!\n\n2. Blue-cheese stuffed olive martinis! These little morsels rock and The Grand Lux Cafe hand-stuffs them. Mmm...\n\n1. And Finally, Miso Salmon. I can't even find the words as to how great this dish is. The fish, the sauce, it is so freakin' good. I have been to the restaurant when they were all out of it (it has to marinade over night and they only make a certain amount) and I think I cried. Thank goodness there are so many other delicious dishes but the Miso Salmon, just might be my request for a last meal."

Everything was going well until my boyfriend found something nice and crispy in his nachos... Green onion? Nope. Charred meat? I guess not. Oh, what was this -- a TOOTHPICK?! Holy moly, that could have been lodged into his throat if he didn't catch that sooner. We complained, got the dish taken off the bill. All was well.\n\nDay two. Now, this was crazy. We got some slightly creepy server named Valerie(?), who took forever to get us water. We must have waited 15 minutes maybe, and then we asked again for water, and she tried to blame it on the bus boy. Um, girl, he's a bus boy, not your water wench, so please, after several years of experience in the restaurant industry, if I was that waitress, I would have gotten my table water right away. That's pretty much a given in any restaurant. Even horrible-service Chinese restaurants give you water faster. And then my blueberry pancakes were blueberry-less... so I had to ask for blueberries, which came on the side. BAH. \n\nThe food here is just okay... I was just reading that review before mine that says that this is Cheesecake Factory's sister restaurant... and I believe it. The Cheesecake Factory is not too great, and neither is this place. It's just well-priced with decently large portions, but it tries to cater to a variety of palates, and I think it tried a little too hard. If you're coming here during a stay at the Venetian, I will say one thing -- it's convenient, and if you're not that hungry and willing to wait a million years for just alright food, then it's all good."

I had originally walked over the Palazzo location Friday night for dinner at 8pm but was turned away due to a kitchen problem?  Anyway, it was a short and quick walk over to this location.\n\nI was quickly seated on a Friday night and it took my server a bit of time to get to me.  Its okay because I had bread and water and the extensive menu to look over since there is tons of choices!  My server did not mention the specials to me...I overheard the other server next to me tell his tables the soups and specials for the evening.  I usually never order specials but it would of been nice to hear her mention it to me as well.\n\nAnyway I decided on the Sunday night pasta entree ($18) and a side broccolini ($5) for my little one!  It was a good choice!  I loved the taste and the soft stewed meat in the pasta dish. It was different but very tasty!  Loved the side order of broccolini as it wasn't drenched in butter or oil like some other places, just steamed like how I like it!\n\nFlagging down my server for the bill and a box took a bit longer than usual, I was in a rush though, I had a flight to catch in a few hours, so maybe she didn't want to rush my Friday night dinner.

I was just at their counterpart early that morning for breakfast and I was extremely happy with the food.  This time around the food selection is not as large at night, which was expected but the food was not outstanding.  I would normally expect the opposite since it normally seems that food is that much better after you've been drinking all night long.  Fries were, chewy, not sure if that is the right word but definitely looked like they just came right out of the fryer.  So maybe old, not sure.  Burgers were good but once again nothing special.  I still give this place a 4 stars since service was still top notch and food was still good for a late night joint."

But my experience here may have changed my mind. \n\nBoth times we were lucky enough to be able to dine 'al fresco' - meaning a gorgeous view of the casino. But hey it still felt cool!\n\nThe first trip was a woozy breakfast after our first night out. We shared a bruschetta style breakfast dish and a couple of other egg dishes. I love that they serve real hash browns instead of home fries - so much more satisfying! The service was awesome, a cute little Asian man (I can say that because I'm Asian and he reminded me of my dad) who was totally attentive and fine with bringing us extra place settings and plates so that we could share. \n\nThe second trip was late at night after a trip to XS. This was an entirely different kind of meal, a ravenously hungry, get me some comfort food now before I fall asleep at the table kind of meal. One of my friends actually may have nodded off while waiting for our food. Again, we shared, this time the zen noodles, a yummy asian noodle soup with a lemongrass broth, and the pasta carbonara, THE BEST pasta carbonara I have ever had. The service again was commendable, considering it was about 2 in the morning and the place was filled with obnoxious patrons. The waiter was super nice and even reassured us when a loud alarm went off in the casino and we got nervous. \n\nPerhaps my two favorite meals of the trip - a pleasant surprise!"

There was so much flavor that I left no morsel uneaten. I nibbled off everyone else's other dish (shrimp scampi, the sandwiches, the burgers, etc), and nothing compared to my dish. WIN!"

We've been told it's the sister company of The Cheesecake Factory, but we think it's better.  The portions are humungous and the prices are cheap.  THIS IS A BAD PLACE FOR A DIET!  We were in Las Vegas over Thanksgiving and ate here the on Thanksgiving Eve.  Like The Cheesecake Factory, they have a large variety of items on the menu and they are all good.  The chicken parmesan comes on a platter large enough to feed 3 or 4 people!  In short the appetizers are huge, the salads are huge and the entr\u00e9e's are HUGE!  For us and more importantly is that the food is very tasty.  We love this place and I would rate it a 5 just on value.  However, the downside is that wait times can be long and the smell of cigarette smoke flows in from the casino floor just outside quite heavily at times.  Tip:  Ask for a table well inside the restaurant."

At this point we had waited 15 minutes but still had no idea who our waiter was. We finally asked the lady in the front to be moved into another section and she quickly sat us somewhere else. After that we had to wait another 20 minutes for food and finally ate after what felt like forever. This was an awful experience and the manager came over and just apologized and walked away. He didn't say anything else, didn't ask us if we needed anything. It was  a very disappointing experience especially because we have eaten here many times before.

The Grand Lux is owned by the Cheesecake Factory, so if you're familiar with that style of food then the concepts are pretty similar.  \n\nThe late night menu was trimmed down a bit, but they still had a good assortment of burgers, sandwiches, & finger foods, plus you could get breakfast dishes if you wanted them.  I just went for a grilled chicken sandwich and a beer, they were fine but our service was slow, and I didn't appreciate that the Grand Lux uses the same seating arrangements as the Cheesecake Factory where they'll seat you uncomfortably close to the next table.  This is especially annoying in Vegas, since the people sitting 18 inches away from us were totally wasted and loud.  If it's just you and one other person try to sit at the bar to avoid that and you'll probably have a better experience."

Got an egg white omelette with veggies and goat cheese. Didn't get the food for another 40mins. And it came out freezing and could not be eaten. The veggies were not fresh. The mushroom was canned. Got charged for goat cheese that was not in my food and it tasted gross all around. Shut this shit down!"

Note: while the Korean beef with pancakes were indeed delicious, I would hardly call it a Korean dish; there were the \"general Asian flavors\" such as ginger, soy sauce, and peanuts, but the Korean beef did not taste of sesame oil nor pear, and the pancakes seemed more flour-based than the traditional Korean pancake.\nThe service was lackluster in my opinion, but I'll let it slide, since I find service tends to go downhill late at night anyway due to the little staff available. Hostess was nice, and quickly showed us to a table. The waiter did not introduce himself, and we were not offered complimentary bread, which we overheard from the other table was because they don't usually do that late at night, but the option was available. Water was not refilled throughout the night, and check took a while to arrive to the table."

I ordered a mojito which was made just right. The one that my friend ordered was good too, I can't remember the name of it but it was yellow. We also ordered the mini chili cheese hot dogs and the crispy Thai shrimp and chicken spring rolls. The chili cheese hot dogs were so cute! It was a little salty for me but it was still good. The way you eat the spring rolls is to wrap it inside  a piece of lettuce along with mint leaves, carrots, and their sweet chili sauce. It was pretty good as well. \n\nYou can never go wrong with grand luxe cafe for breakfast, a quick snack, or late meal after the clubs."

The person at the end basically had their back pressed against our table. We mentioned it was cramped and asked if there were any other tables.  She said no, even though there were plenty of 4 tops open, and no one waiting.  She snarked \"that's why I asked if you wanted the high table\", although she failed to mention the cramped conditions when she asked.  We then said we'd take the high top, and which point she pointed at it from across the room and said \"the one he's cleaning\", referring to the busboy.  And then walked off.

I will give it a \"slightly better than lousy\".\n\nI have been a satisfied patron at both locations (the one at the Palazzo and the Venetian) several times before, however, this particular visit was just truly horrible.  Our waiter was absolutely dreadful ... he was about as useless as the guy at the Genius Bar at the Apple store when you're asking for help and you happen to NOT have an appointment.  Our food arrived way way late, in fact, the people on the table next to us were being served their dessert by the time we got our entree ... and they freaking arrived and ordered several minutes after us.  Our drinks were neither refilled nor removed once we were finished with them ... and none of our small appetizer plates were removed during the entire length of service.  I realize that this is no MIchelin star joint ... but come on we deserve better than that. \n\nAs for the food ... well, it's difficult not to dislike it given the service or lack thereof.  The calamari was pretty much just eating fried batter or as my friend would describe it \"deep fried tire parts\".  The miso salmon was under-seasoned and just plain inedible .. as well as the shrimp scampi that I had the misfortune of ordering.  Funny thing is, I've had these dishes in the past and I know they can be good ... but this occasion must've been Amateur Chef night in the back.\n\nI will never go back to this place and I advise the rest to avoid this place the same way you would an unleashed dog that happens to be foaming at the mouth with it's owner nowhere in the vicinity.  If you really feel the need to ... check out the other location at the Palazzo (it's only a few steps away) ... at least the last time I checked it out, they didn't have servers who thought they still worked at the DMV!"

It was like a \"fancy looking\" pho, the broth was served separately on the side and it had more noodles than meat but it was good enough to satisfy our craving, although really not worth $14.\n\nThe primary reason I'm only giving two stars is because the wait time was horrible.  We got there around 3 AM, which was well before the club crowd so we were seated immediately.  After we gave our order though, we had to wait an eternity to get our food.  It was like that for all the tables next to us too.  Our waitress was apologetic and kept reassuring each table our food would be out in a couple minutes but a couple minutes ended up turning into an hour.  I get that it's busy but I can't imagine how long the wait would be for the people that came after us who actually had to wait in line for a table.  In total we were there for 2 hours but only 15 - 30 minutes of that was actually spent eating while all the rest was spent waiting (for our food, for the bill, for them to take our credit card...).\n\nIf you're looking for a place to grub after clubbing, I'd recommend going someplace else like Earl of Sandwich instead.  You can get a great tasting meal in a few minutes and for half the price."

I'm not a huge fan of pasta, but when done correctly, it's like I'm having a party in my mouth. The pasta to sauce ratio was perfect, chicken was cooked very nicely and the hot chili flakes added that much-needed kick to the dish. Definitely one of the best pastas I've had. Had I not stuffed myself in the beginning with bread, I probably would have been able to finish it, but I ended up taking half to-go. \n\nFor Vegas, this was very reasonably priced and once again, the service was on point especially with the number of large parties in attendance that night.

Always great walking out of a club in the early morning and being able to get some good food at a nice restaurant. The service this last time was a little dodgy (rude waiter), but this may have been a one-off. The food is as good as can be expected from a glorified Cheesecake Factory, but it gets the job done. Enjoy!"

AWESOME!\n-Fast seating (well it should be if you're rolling in at 3-4 am in the morning!)\n-Wide variety of choices to choose from\n-Clean, dimmed light ambiance, and roomy\n-Being loud and drunk-talking is expected (AGAIN YOU'RE IN VEGAS!)\n-Attentive waiters\n-Large portions starting from $12-$$ for entrees (I'd suggest sharing your meal because you always end up taking half of it back to your hotel and not eat it the next day anyways!)\n\nCons:\n-Bathrooms are outside of the restaurant in the casino\n\nAll-in-all, a great go-to spot while you're in Vegas and want decent food other than your typical \"late night Dennys\" stop after the club."

The prices are fair for the portions and quality of the food. \n\nThe service was off in one instance where everyone got their food except me because of a kitchen error (I think my plate was sent to a different table). However, I'm not bitter because the server was straight up about it and very apologetic. He vowed to get me my grilled cheese right away and even offered a side to hold me over. When I said I didn't need a side, he insisted, so I went with french fries and he brought me the a huge bowl of fries. I'm talking 2 or 3 times a normal meal portion. Not necessary, but I appreciated the gesture. \n\nOh, and I definitely appreciated that grilled cheese!"

I don't think the food here is quite as good though, but it does have the benefit of being open 24/7 so it was exactly what my party was looking for when we rolled in at 2 am in the morning. The late menu is a bit limited (two pages only). I got the Chili-Lime Chicken and Mango Salad which was sort of missing the Chili-Lime flavor part, but they substituted the romaine lettuce for spinach at no extra cost which was nice. I also wish there were more actual bits of chicken in my salad (they were so tiny and hard to find you almost had to squint at the dish to identify them.) I also tried my friend's Crispy Fried Wontons which had great Asian inspired flavors but were SOO salty. Personally I think the Cheesecake Factory is better. Great service though, they brought out a cute little desert for my friend who's birthday it was."

It can get a bit busy but at the most, you'll wait about 15 minutes to get seated. Most of the time you'll be seated upon arrival. The atmosphere is very dim (probably for the hungover people)... Service is usually pretty good although it is a rather large restaurant so it gets a bit hectic. The coffee is amazing. Maybe because it's Italian and we're by the \"venetian\" =P"

It's very convenient that the Venetian Lux is 24 hours, and it was located right next to the elevators to our room. We decided to share some appetizers for our late night snack. We ordered the Fried Calamari and the Lettuce wraps. I have eaten at Lux before and liked what I ordered the last time we were here but this time I was just kinda meh. The Lettuce wraps were just ok, the filling was a bit too salty. The fried calamari was ok, it also had shrimp in it, I thought it was decent but I know it didn't sit well with my GF. Within 30 minutes after we left, my GF had to make a deposit at the Wynn and it was not a cash deposit. We think it might have been the dipping sauce. Overall it was just ok, can't really complain too much as it's really convenient they are open 24 hours. I like their breakfast a lot better and will be back for that in the future."

The cafe is easy to find coming off of the parking garage elevators, it's a quick jaunt across the casino floor. We were sat right away by a pleasant hostess and received a booth as requested. The decor is beautiful in this cafe and the ceiling is simply stunning. It is a work of art, very beautiful.\n\nHere's some pros & cons during my visit:\n\nPRO's\n1.) Large food selection\n2.) Delicious, complimentary bread basket\n3.) Great wait staff - courteous, helpful and kind\n4.) Fantastic pot roast French fry appetizer (I recommend), yummy Manhattan salad and penne with a silky, smooth alfredo sauce\n5.) Huge portions, easy to share\n\nCONS's\n1.) Food brought out wrong the first time and had to wait while they remade it\n2.) Very pricey - think upscale, Cheesecake Factory\n3.) Large food selection - I spent 20 minutes flipping through this huge menu trying to decide on something to eat\n4.) The server we got was not knowledgeable on the menu. I asked simple questions like \"what pasta does this dish come with?\" and he didn't know.\n\nAll-in-all, I would definitely visit again for lunch, however I don't see myself coming for dinner service. I can see how this is a great spot for tourists or hotel guests though. Make sure you have more than a 1 hour lunch before eating here. It does take a bit of time."

For those of you who do not know, Grand Lux is the slightly more upscale sister restaurent of Cheesecake Factory, and you can expect to find a lot of similarities between the two chains.  \n\nYou can sometimes hit a wait, but this place is MASSIVE and seating normally happens quickly, if not immediately.  The service here is always great, and despite how busy this place may look, the food always comes out quickly.\n\nThe menu here is HUGE, and the worst part of the meal is generally trying to decide what you want to order.  The asian nachos are hands down my favorite thing on the menu, with the chicken and waffles a close second.  Those two choices alone should give you a sense of how diverse the menu is, with something for everyone's tastes.  \n\nOne word of caution though, the portions here, like the menu, are HUGE, so be careful not to over order...you might want to dig well into your appetizer before thinking about ordering an entree."

Their burger buns are really good. I recommend the spicy carnitas sandwich - slow cooked pork with avocado, cilantro, and salsa made to perfection! Also, the jambalaya is delicious and the lunch portion is more than enough food. \n\nThe customer service is great. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Also, the waiting time for this restaurant is never more than 10 mins. It's a large place and it's run very efficiently. \n\nThis place is probably the best restaurant on this side of the strip.

The only downfall is that it's inside The Venetian resort and I'm not a fan of the strip on my days off. XD"

I just finished having lunch with a gf who loves Grand Lux and is in from out of town, so politely agreed to join at Palazzo. I ordered something different from the Asian Nachos which is the only thing that I have had there that I thought was extra good at one time, but the last time I got them thought they had gone downhill, so decided to switch today to the Rachel (sister to a Ruben). The meat was so greasy and bad tasting that I literally had to pull it from the sandwich and eat the slaw and bread alone which too was overly greased and dripping. I stopped eating at about half because I thought it would make my stomach upset if I ate more. Trust me, I don't usually walk away from a Ruben sandwich. With so many great places to eat in Vegas why bother?"

Oh, do I miss the 7am breakfast after a long night... and I just got back from Vegas a few days ago. This was the closer of the night/morning. After a grueling night with the City of Sin, we, along with many others, find ourselves here at the Grand Lux Cafe. I think I've been here 4 times in 3 days. \n\nThe food is surprisingly very good! I ordered the pizza lunch special on my first visit and loved it. It didn't get me stuffed but I was full and content. Better than eating a buffet, where I always over eat and feel like crap come dinner time. Came back the next morning... or some would call it... a few hours later and had the \"healthy breakfast\" which consisted of chicken breast, egg whites and some veggies. I did not expect it to be good, and it wasn't but it wasn't bad either... it was healthy (understandable). \n\nHad a legit breakfast here (like actually waking up in the morning and coming here). The breakfast buffet was excellent! The selection was very limited but the items that they have were all great. The hash browns were cooked to perfection, not burnt but not undercooked. The omelets were great too. \n\nLastly, had one last breakfast, this time it wasn't legit (due to the fact that there was no sleep prior to this breakfast) Don't know what I ordered, could be my lack of memory, or we can just blame it on the night. \n\nNow to the service. It was excellent every time we were there (and I remembered). I must say though, our waitress for breakfast was absolutely wonderful. Definition of great customer service! If i knew her name I'd let you guys know... but the entire staff at the Grand Lux is amazing. Great service!"

Once I figured this out, I knew the portions were going to be HUGE!  \n\nI ordered the parmasean crusted chicken.  After we ordered, we were given very fluffy and warm bread. We killed the first bread almost immediately.  Then I needed to use the restroom.  I hate how a lot of restaurants in Vegas have their restrooms outside and not inside.  It isn't convenient at all.  \n\nIt took awhile for our food to come out.  We were hungry so we asked for another loaf of bread.  Yum, still warm and fluffy as ever.  Finally the food comes, and the presentation looks amazing.  The chicken was breaded very nicely and the edge was crispy as hell.  The inside was juicy too.  Although I thought the spaghetti that came with it tasted very bland in the beginning, I realized it worked really well with the parmasean chicken.  \n\nEating regular meals in Vegas is so hard, especially for a gambler like me.

Prices are cheesecake factory prices, so don't expect to get like 3.99 steak and eggs. For my burger and fries it came out to about 12 dollars with tax and gratuity. \n\nTo go is really worth it since you get the same thing without paying gratuity. a little longer wait, but still the same quality food.

The waitress got my meal almost completely wrong, but I didn't have time to have them do it again.\n\nThe total bill for 3 coffees, a salmon omelet, french toast, bowl of fruit and breakfast platter came out to $67. \n\nI had originally planned to go here tomorrow night for a cocktail hour before going to see a show- but I'm definitely not doing that anymore."

I swear, those were not 3 eggs. If it was, then those were some dinosaur eggs. Wifey got some kind of pasta. It had bacon in it and was kinda salty. Overall, not bad. I liked it. \n\nPROS: Dinosaur eggs and large portions of everything. \n\nCONS: Don't refill breakfast buffet half hour before closing."

Since this is owned by the Cheesecake Factory, the decor and many choices and the menu had much the same flavor.\n\nFirst visit (5AM)-Fried chicken and waffles.\nSecond visit (5PM)-a huge Max Burger.\nThird visit (4AM)-corned beef hash and eggs.\n\nThe late night menu was very extensive and there's pretty much something to satisfy every craving.  The corned beef hash is real strips of corned beef, not that dog food can stuff you get at Safeway.  That meal was the least favorite of the three.  Fried chicken and waffles were good.  Burger was great.\n\nService was quick and filled water and drinks often.\n\nThe floor was really slippery like someone dropped a bottle of olive oil and the cleaner spread it around the entire joint.  At one point, a lady fell as she was exiting.  Note to restaurant:slippery floor+tons of drunk people at 5AM=accident and lawsuit waiting to happen.\n\nWe ran into Ron Jeremy in the waiting area-the legend of something."

Restaurant is basically an upscale Cheesecake Factory (same creators) minus the million flavors of cheesecake. Food is just as good, almost the same actually. I got the Madeira chicken which I always get at The Cheesecake Factory and no complaints. I shared a calamari appetizer and was pleased to find some fried zucchini and even shrimps as well. The batter could have been more crunchy though.\n\nService was great, although the pace of our meal was a bit slow but I can understand that since our group was so large. Also, it was a bit dark in the restaurant to where I had a hard time reading the menu. And ladies in heels, be careful as the floor is quite slippery. Nonetheless, I'll be returning."

The Asian pear martini was good but I don't think that it is $14 good.\n\nFrom the dessert menu, I ordered the red velvet cake.

We made the effort to get replacements so that we can finally have a civilized sit down lunch for once! \n\nWe sat next to this sweet elder couple who was enjoying their lunch. I was sold when I saw what the man was eating. A bowl of chili with this scrumptious corn bread and I just had to have it! I wanted the chilis but wasn't sure how that was going to sit in my stomach for the next 6+ hours so decided not to get that. Instead, went for this shaky beef and I swear they had chopped down every scallions in the fridge because my plate was loaded with scallions and onions. Let's just say that after lunch, I was literally brushing my teeth and tongue with altoids. \n\nBut OMG, the cornbread was divine! It was so moist, it was like eating a moist sweet yellow cake with corn kernels. It was so moist, that it had to be eaten with a spoon because it kept falling off my hands. But it was the best cornbead i've ever eaten. \n\nThe service was decent, the environment was very similar to the cheesecake factory except it's not a chain restaurant? Er, at least I don't think it is. \n\nAnother reason I find it endearing is because when I got up to use the restroom, the nice elderly couple asked my boss if I was her daughter. My boss said no but sometimes she has to play the role of a mommy to me. Well, the lady complimented me and said that I was very pretty. *Blushed*"

With high ceilings and plenty of seating, the room is tastefully decorated and feels upscale.\n- Service is top notch here! At least it has been every time I have been here so far! For our last visit, Casey was our server and he was great! \n-For being a food outlet a)on the strip and b)inside the Venetian, the prices are incredibly fair! It's a great way to enjoy a nice meal and not feel like you're breaking the bank! This was probably the biggest surprise of all!\n- the menu is HUGE! The amount of options available to you is fantastic!\n- this staff hustles! I mean servers and bussers were in constant motion tending to a guest or prepping a table for the next party! \n- Casey was great about keeping drinks filled and checking in with us from time to time without being intrusive. It was perfect!\n\n\nFor this last experience, I ordered the rib eye steak(cooked medium rare) ($27). The steak was cooked almost perfectly! It was so juicy and tender and marinated beautifully! The garlic mashed potatoes were pretty tasty as well! The steak was so good that I decided to enjoy it without any steak sauce or ketchup(which I never do!)\n\nI think this place is a real gem and I will keep returning to enjoy more of the menu! I teetered back and forth between 4 and 5 stars for this review, but given the price point and consistently good service, I have to give it a 5! \n\n5 stars!"

BUT after paying $15!!!!!!!!!!! for that crap i get after 30 minutes of waiting: Poached eggs, hashbrowns, no bread.

The menu is equally extensive with just about anything you could want ranging from basic salads, sandwiches and burgers to breakfast foods to Asian fusion items to insanely large desserts.  \n\nWe dropped by at an off time (2:30PM) but the place was still very full and busy. We had an early dinner planned so we opted to share a few appetizers and had drinks. We shared the spring rolls, crab cakes and strawberry shortcake dessert. Note: even though it says \"spring\" rolls these are more like egg rolls and deep fried. The inside is kind of a mushy texture so it wasn't obvious that it was chicken and shrimp. The crab cakes were surprisingly good, with each (two per order) a good size and filled with a generous amount of real crab. Mustard-y sauce was a great tangy complement. Strawberry shortcake was huge with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle and topped with whipped cream and strawberries. Very sweet and decadent but not the most amazing in terms of quality of shortbread. Drinks were solid and the drink menu offers everything from wines to different kinds of bellinis to bloody Mary's and more!\n\nOverall solid option and great for variety but nothing amazing."

Their menu options are vast so I really think the experience can vary based on what you order.  \n\nFirst of all, the restaurant is located right on the casino floor of the Venetian.  We sat right in the front balcony area which can be exciting but not recommended if you're sensitive to cigarette smoke.  After a while, all the smoke made our eyes water so I would advise a table in the interior of the restaurant if you're smoke-adverse.\n\nI ordered the Sunday Night Pasta on a Sunday night.  The portion was generous, always a plus.  The meat sauce had beef short rib, steak, mushrooms, and other seasonings.  My test for pasta is, I can usually polish off an entire entree if it is really, really good.  With this pasta I found the meat sauce to be on the heavy side.  The spaghettini was all right but on a whole, the entree did not wow me as it did in some of the other reviews.  I ate about half my plate.  My wife got the Zen noodle soup.  I tasted it.  Not recommended.  Probably should have known better than to order an Asian noodle dish here.\n\nTo be clear, there's like a hundred other things on the menu we didn't try.  I intend to come back and try something new."

A little bit spicy for me because there was red pepper flakes which I didn't expect but it was still good and loaded with clams.  My husband had the Fried Chicken.  It was really good and a huge portion with a mound of mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, glazed carrots, and steamed brocolli on the side.  The Creole dippng sauce that came with it was the best part.  The service was really great, quick, and friendly.

I can not imagine someone being unable to find their particular craving, and although there are only two specific vegetarian entrees, they are both delicious. I had the most insane vegetable plate (red cabbage, mashed sweet potatoes to name two), and they even let me substitute green beans for the white rice it was supposed to be served with. We also had the tofu entree, and it was equally delicious, perhaps a little sweet for everyday consumption, but a great treat. The smoothies are top-notch. As you can see from the pictures, everything looks amazing, which means a lot to me. When someone in the kitchen cares enough to make it look pretty, it is a  promising sign it will taste good.\n\nThe fact that the Grand Lux pulls it off while serving a dining room of probably at least 5000 square feet makes me love it even more.\n\nIn the battle of 24-hour upscale diner/cafe casinoland, The Grand Lux definitely exceeds Cafe Bellagio in taste and presentation. True, sometimes you just need to gaze at a spectacular flower display while chomping on your $18 patty melt, but if scenery is not a concern, head to the Grand Lux."

If not, they're only closed at the butt-crack of dawn ;)\n\n-- Late night menu (dinner and breakfast)\n\n-- Short wait. I usually dine in parties of 6 or more and we've never waited longer than 10-15 minutes.\n\n-- Drunk and don't want to wait in the long taxi line or gamble?! Sober up here!\n\n-- This is your last chance to get at some girls/guys. You're in Vegas, make it happen! LOL"

However, a sign said it would only take 5-7 mins to get seated which is 100 percent accurate. The issue was that it too about 15 mins before we even got ask for our drinks and it took about 20 mins to get our food. \n\nThe food itself was okay. We got the Baja omelette, joe's scrambled, and the hash. The good was pretty good (it should be for the price). I asked for a sausage to be added to my omelette, but the forgot that no big deal. Also, the omelette was more like a ton of onions and peppers under some eggs; it wasn't really omelette, but that's not that big of a deal. The hash and joes scramble was great. \n\nGoing back to the service...its just slow. Ask for some coffee wait 10 mins. Ask for creamer wait 10 mins. The waiters are just overloaded with tables to serve. It's a huge location and the slow down in breakfast service reflects it. \n\nI wouldn't come back here for breakfast."

The vinaigrette seemed to be missing, but the spicy sauce had a kick. Mandarin Cosmo was made with an excess of sweet and sour. I have a feeling they missed the Mandarin part. If you pay $12 for a martini, it should be semi-decent. Because for $2 more in Vegas, you can pay a bartender who knows to make your drink...\n\nService was not bad - our waiter had a lot of pep to his step. Red bull gives you wings, definitely.\n\nSecond night: Buffalo Chicken Rolls\n\nFor those familiar to Cheesecake, this is the Buffalo Blast's step-sister. Nothing great to note about the dish. Service was lackluster.\n\nOverall, okay - but nothing too impressive to note."

The grapefruit juice is a bit bitter for my taste but if you like the fruit, you'll like the juice. Served in wine glasses so the portions are on the smaller side.\n-Grand lux french toast with strawberries: perfect! Six pieces of thick toast sprinkled with powered sugar, strawberries, and maple syrup. \n-Eggs bendict with hashbrowns: perfectly poached eggs atop canadian bacon and an english muffin drizzled with hollandaise sauce.

Maybe it's because I'm used too excellence when dining here, but they just don't seem like what they used to be.  The wait time was much longer than what I was told and there were forgotten items and modifications made to my meal.  On top of that, a plate that I always order here was not served to it's potential.  The chicken that night tasted absolutely plain.  It's going to be a while before my next Grand Lux meal"

I waited for my waiter for at least 20 minutes before he came by and asked if I wanted anything to drink. He was entertaining a big group sitting next to me. I asked if another waiter can take my order since I was hungry, but she insisted that I wait for my waiter. \n\nMy waiter finally came by and took my order. I ordered Polynesian Salad. It was delicious and large! I liked the flavors of the ingredients in the salad--mango, cucumber, grilled chicken with sprinkling of apricot-pineapple dressing. \n\nAfter I finished my salad, I noticed that my waiter did not delivered my complimentary bread that I saw on every tables. I was disappointed to see and experience such bad service here because I really enjoyed the food here. \n\nI would come back here for the food, but I really hope that they improved their service next time I am here. \n\nPlus, they are opened 24 hours, perfect for those late night hungers!!"

We stayed at the Venetian hotel and this was the only place that was open 24/7 with great late night eats. The food court got tiring after so many visits. The menu is here is so extensive that you can try something new every time. We came in for lunch one day and many of us ordered their lunch special, such a great deal. For $10 bucks you can get a cup of soup, side salad, and half a sandwich. All my friends said they enjoyed what they ordered. I opted to pay $2 more for the side salad and half pasta combo. Even half of a regular pasta entr\u00e9e was a lot for me to eat for lunch and I even had to take it to go. The Cabonara pasta is so tasty! Loaded with cream sauce, which I love, I hate dry pastas, it got a boost of flavor from the bits of bacon and green peas. Because it is Vegas, top off your meal with a cocktail! The Blood Orange Mojito is an excellent choice! The fries there are to die for. It seems so simple and so common a thing, but the fires there keep me coming back. Maybe there's a special oil that they cook them in because they have a richer and sweeter after taste. They're just ordinary fries, but dip it in a bit of ranch or ketchup and you'll be chomping away the whole plate of fries before you know it! Service here also never fails, always friendly and quick, despite it being super crowded all the time. I came back so many times the manager even remembered me. He called me \"Sloppy Joe Girl\" because one night I ordered it and he was happy I came back for more food. He even kept going back to the kitchen to check up on our take out order so we wouldn't be waiting so long. This makes up for the crappy cashier. He did however apologize to us and said that he was just having a bad day, but still, don't take it out on your customers, that's very unprofessional. One night we ordered a sloppy joe and the other night we ordered the chicken cream pasta with sun dried tomatoes for take out. The sloppy joe was nice and tangy with a sprinkle of chopped onions, so good! The meat was loaded with flavor, probably too salty alone, but when paired up with the long sandwich buns, it was a perfect balance. It also came with a side sauce of some orange tangy nature which I didn't care too much for. The chicken pasta was good, but probably not my favorite dish there so far. It didn't have as much cream sauce compared to the Cabonara that I liked and the grilled chicken was dry. It was a little hard to eat. It was a huge portion though, it fed like three of us girls! Till next time Grand Lux, I will be back for you!"

While they don't serve the exact same dishes, it's essentially the same type of food, portions and price.\n\nLike most places in Vegas casinos, it can be difficult to find. It's on the casino level near the escalators that connect the casino floor to the Venetian Shops. \n\nThis is by no means a 'must eat' place in Vegas, but if you're nearby and looking for a meal that's better than Denny's but cheaper than Tao, then give this place a try.\n\nIf I was rating this place based off of my most recent visit, I'd only give them 2 stars because our food took forever to come out and when it did it was cold. But I generously gave them 3 stars because the other times I've been there this wasn't a problem. Perhaps it was the time of day when we visited. I think we got sat in our server's section just as she was about to get off. \n\nFinally, other Yelper's said they had good pancakes, but sadly I didn't get to try them (despite my intense post Vegas night out cravings) because they stop making pancakes at 11am.

You may want to turn away now especially if you absolutely love Grand Lux.  My friend Yin was set on going to the Grand Lux location at the Venetian.  We probably should've gone to a buffet instead.\n\nA haggard server took our orders and pleasantly answered our questions.  She suggested a vinagerette on the side since I wasn't sure about whether I would like it or not.  Omelette and Hash Browns, two Pasta Carbonaras, Fried Chicken and Waffles (Boneless fried chicken and one Belgian Waffle - why it's plural on the menu is misleading) and Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya.  She even recommended lunch portions of our Carbonaras because they serve HUGE portions.\n\nThey switched servers to a perky young lady who seemed eager to take our order.  Sharida was her name, I believe, and she had curly hair.  She was taking over for the previous lady.  We were glad to have her.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, the first server surprisingly came back with the duck potstickers (delicious by the way) and a boat of my salad dressing.  In addition, a scalding hot loaf of sliced sourdough bread came a few minutes later.  Within this time, Grand Lux Cafe seats about six guys with luggages by their side to my right.  Soon thereafter, a family of five sits to my left.\n\n15 minutes after getting our appetizers and bread...\n\nThe table of six guys gets their order of cold sandwiches and other quick-fix dishes.  \"Hmmm...\" we think to ourselves.  \"They get their order before us but they sat later.  At least we got our potstickers and bread to tide us over.  Besides, it probably takes quicker to fix their lunch than ours does.  What am I going to do with this salad dressing without salad though?\"  They take our appetizer plate and small dishes away.  \n\n20-minute mark from the time they delivered our appetizers...\n\n25-minute mark...\n\nThe family to my left gets their orders.  I noticed some had fried chicken, others pasta, still others, hot and tasty dishes.  Okay, something was seriously wrong.\n\n30-minute mark..\n\n35-minute mark..\n\nI try to flag down our waitress who went from one of the bar tables and goes to six-guy table to my right and asks if everything came out alright.  I try to catch her attention through her peripheral vision, but she clearly makes her way to the kitchen.  \n\n40-minute mark..\n\nMy cousin gets up and seeks out our waitress.  He follows her, calls out, but according to him she ignored him and bolted for the kitchen.  The two ladies at the end of the bar simply tell him, \"You don't look so happy.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" he says, but with a smile because they're girls.  He was hiding his frustration.  He sits back down with us.\n\n45 minutes after getting our appetizers...\n\nAll of us are so hungry and waiting there.  I lost my appetite.  Our drinks aren't even filled.  My cousin says, \"Let's get out of here.\"  I on the other hand didn't want to leave without at least paying for the potstickers.\n\n\"Let's just leave,\" he repeats standing up.  \"I don't need this.  We should just go somewhere else.  Clearly the other tables got their food and we didn't.\"  He pointed out the bar area also got their food right away.  I was beginning to suspect a number of different factors as to why we didn't get ours, but I had enough of it too.  I stood up too looking around for any server.  Yin makes her way to the hostess to try and flag a manager.  My brother stands up. Our table is empty.  Just as the last of our friends agrees and stands up ready to leave, several food servers come out with our dishes.\n\nThe cheese on our carbonara was dried and hard from the prolonged heat.  The fried chicken wasn't fresh.  The waffle was on the verge of being burnt.  The omelette looked rubbery.  In spite of it all, I liked my creamy pasta and I think the bacon saved it.  I just had to move the cheese.  I was so upset I only ate half of it and didn't enjoy it as much as I could've had it been fresher earlier.  You can *definitely* tell all of our food had been sitting out for a while.  Salad greens were wilted and had dark spots and tomatoes were mushy.\n\nThe manager, Marty, kept asking how she could make it up to us...crap 5000 word limit-\n\nWe understand restaurants tend to get busy especially during Sunday mornings and afternoons in Vegas, but clearly, there was some miscommunication between servers and the kitchen.  Maybe it was Sharida's first day.  There are legitimate reasons as to why service (albeit friendly) was abhorrent.  Our server could've at LEAST periodically come by with a status.\n\nI've never ever come across service like this.  I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.  I'd go back to Grand Lux Cafe out of mercy, but never will I set foot at this location again.  \n\nWe had as much fun on our dining experience as you had reading my rant."

I picked up a chocolate creme brulee and man was that thing ultra rich and full of choco-goodness. I actually picked up a brownie too, but after attempting to finish my creme brulee, I wound up only eating half of that (i felt guilty because i made a point of eating healthy during my whole trip....damnit), and saved my brownie (it was nicely wrapped with a ribbon and everything) for my boyfriend when he picked me up at the airport the next morning. he loved it, btw. \n\ni'll have to eat there next time, but probably late at night, since the menu looks so much more appealing after drinking."

We shared a chicken pasta dish in a red sauce.  The pasta was surprisingly cooked to perfection.  Just to be overwhelmed by the sauce.  Oh, so close yet so far.  Shaking beef and caramel chicken combo was ok.  Chicken's taste was overwhelming and nothing special.  The beef was quite good but, in total contrast to everything else at this place, gave a tiny portion. My family loves this place so I will probably be back. Unfortunately."

The buffet selection was pretty extensive, and all of the food was quite tasty. The orange juice (provided by the server; not at the buffet,) was delicious! It was a true freshly squeezed orange juice and tasted like no orange juice I've ever had. I loved it! This is a good place in the Venetian to get a tasty meal fast."

Great dressing, generous amount of tender and juicy chicken plus a bag of tortilla strips to sprinkle on top. \n\nThe to go area has a few seats but usually not enough.

You're losing but you don't want your S. O. or family to know it\n3. You are broke, but you don't want to eat Mall food in either of the 2 food courts\n4. The dinner show was sold out\n5. Cheesecake Factory is your favorite restaurant\n6. You want to stay close to the \"Wizard of Oz\" slot machines in hopes of getting one when it opens up\n7. You are tired of walking from the Sands Convention center all the way to your room, so you stop here to rest and eat\n\nThe Grand Lux Cafe is a moderately priced, large and usually noisy restaurant at the hub of activity in the Venetian. It is between the room elevators, the escalators to the self-park parking garage, some shops, an information and ticket buying booth for shows, and the casino floor, and near the grand walkway to the lobby.\n\nIt has a large menu with something for everyone, with most entrees around $15 - $25.  Very much like the Cheesecake Factory, since this restaurant was designed by the creators of the Cheesecake Factory, that ubiquitous faux fine dining restaurant so popular with the suburban mall rat crowd.\n\nActually, I had a pretty good salmon entree here, well presented and not too expensive. The two Gin and Tonics helped my enjoyment. \n\nService is slower, though, but you should be able to find something reasonably tasty to satisfy your poor, tired soul here in the town that wasn't built on winners.\n\nI forgot to see what Cheesecakes they offer here."

I arrived around 6:00PM after cruising the G2E Global Gaming Show all day. The restaurant was crowded but, thankfully, there was no wait to get in.\n\nI was promptly greeted by a friendly hostess and was offered a seat in the Bar area rather than the main restaurant. (I'm glad they didn't seat me on the casino terrace as I don't like that area at all -- mostly because the scent they fill the casino with is obnoxiously strong there.) There are two TVs in the bar -- one was tuned to a sports channel while the other was tuned to the first presidential debate.The restaurant areas I visited appeared clean, fresh and well-cared for. My table and seating area were also clean and the table was set for two. I was given a glass of water, a 1/2 loaf of their amazing sourdough bread and a generous serving of butter within just a few short minutes of being seated.\n\nMy waiter, Charles S., was very friendly and attentive and he wholeheartedly agreed with my choice of dinner: Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella. The large main dish portion was made with fresh ingredients and presented nicely on a large clean plate. There was lots of tasty, well-prepared pasta with a tomato, cream and garlic sauce; a generous portion of flavorful grilled chicken breast; and many appealing small orange and red pear-shaped \"mini\" tomatoes. The dish was garnished with fresh mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese and a basil pesto. The menu claims the tomatoes are roasted but mine did not appear that way. A very delicious and filling dish. The iced tea I was served also passed muster though the refill I was offered was a tad strong for my liking.\n\nGLC is owned by the same company that owns The Cheesecake Factory. I have eaten at many GLC locations across the country and I'm always happy with the facility, food and staff. The price for meals is a bit on the high side (my dinner this evening with tax and just over 20% tip was a tad under $26) but well worth it for the quality of the experience.\n\n-- 4.3 well-deserved stars"

I love coming to this particular one rather than the one inside of the Palazzo. They are both a grand lux however I have always received not only better food but also service at this one! The Grand Lux Margarita has got to be one of the best margarita's that i've had whenever i've been to a place like Grand Lux! As far as the entree's I really like the Thai Chicken Pizza which was removed from the menu so I eat the Chicken & Waffles depending on the night i order it, it's either really bland or over seansoned. The fish basket is also another good choice."

My chicken was absolutely delicious and melted in my mouth. It is really big so I think you'll never have to wait for a long time and the atmosphere it's really nice and not that noisy. Service was prompt and the food came fast and really hot with some good portion sizes. At the end of the day what matters is if the food was good not if it's like another restaurant."

Actually, I like CF better for some reason.\n\nWe came here for brunch and our server was rushed and to the point. It was hard to get a hold of her for the majorty of our meal. I had a BLT and the bacon was really thick but overcooked. I could get the waitress to fix it. I'm glad that at least my friends enjoyed their meals."

We were in the area so thought to give it another chance. We came for breakfast before we left back home. It's like a cheesecake factory but the quality of the food is nowhere near as good. i got the chicken and waffles which were okay nothing special and the hubby got Huevos Rancheros again nothing special. probably won't ever come back even if they opened one up in Scottsdale again. Service was okay, the waitress seemed a little busy so we didn't see her that often. Oh the strawberry lemonade was delicious though."

Another tidbit is that they are actually owned by The Cheesecake Factory so if you're getting that vibe well now you know. \n\nI haven't seen this place overly packed but they do try to service to you as soon as they can. The waiters and waitresses are friendly and I had no problem with them whatsoever. \n\nI do recommend eating the Pasta Carbonera; with chicken it is a hefty $20 but you are at the casino so you can always win that back. The pasta was cooked well and the flavors were amazing. Yes, it does read that the pasta is imported. However, I asked the waiter and he stated that they are not imported per say. It's more on the ingredients that make the pasta was imported. Tricky tricky haha! By the time I was finished, I had leftovers and no room for dessert but I do hear there's a great dessert place in the Grand Canal Shoppes ;)"

My husband had the chicken and waffles and both were phenomenal! The waffles were light, perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside...BOMB!  The chicken was full of flavor.  Our server was Mike and he was on point!  My husband and I cannot recall the last time we had GREAT service and by all staff. This place will be a regular future stop on our Vegas visits!  Highly recommended!"

The best part was the bacon...so is $16.50 worth it for bacon. I suppose if work is paying for it.  \n\nService was very slow here. Maybe lunch and dinner is better or ordering a la carte for breakfast."

We yelped it and apparently this place was created by the owners of Cheese Cake Factory, so we thought okay this should be decent. My bf got the Chicken Parmesan and he is still talking about it days after we ate there. I got the Pasta Fresca which I normally wouldn't have ordered but I was feeling extra crappy because of a bug I caught and didn't want to eat any meat, so it was perfect for me at the time. I would definitely go back. Too bad they don't have one in SF. \n\nGood food for a decent price at a place you wouldn't expect it - at the Venetian!"

Hostess smiled and looked around for tables, then looked around for a coworker... By this time there was 8 people behind us. She asked us how many for the second time, we said two, she smiled and made eye contact with another employee who started walking her way. This couple who was behind us was then asked by her how many, they said two and she said \"ok come with me\"... What the heck? And sits them on an \"outside\" . The second coworker makes it to us 2 mins after and puts us in between two other couples. Tight and awkward. Like in previous posts, although not busy everything took long.\n\nI was already a bit irritated about the hostess situation and waiting 10 mins for bread and water that we decided just to share a waffle since we had heard great things and eat dinner elsewhere.\n\n4/5 Food\nBread was terrible. More like toast. Super hard and very crumby. Not hot or even warm. Waffle oj the other hand though was perfect. Crispy, fluffy and full of flavor!! So so good. A must try.\n\nThere is no check back with your food. We had 3 waiters in the 45 min time frame we where there. No refills either on water. Bill was quick to come out."

As \"nice\" as everyone is, there are a few important key qualities that were missing from this experience. We were a party of 11 and understandably at a restaurant it may be difficult to get everyone's food out hot and at the same time. \n\nI'm going to start with there was 45 minute wait, great no problem, it's delicious food. We sat down and drink orders were taken, and not delivered for a while. I know it may be tough to understand if you don't have kids yourself, but when someone has a two year old, please bring the child's drink out... ASAP. No matter how busy your kitchen is, it doesn't take more than a few minutes to bring out Apple juice, not 10. Then after 15 minutes we sent someone to ask for the bread basket to hold us over, until the rest of our drinks arrived and food order was taken.\n\nI ordered the Braised Pot Roast, delicious. It came out with the broccoli cold, I literally handed a piece to the server when they came back... He didn't seem like he knew exactly how to respond to that because it was so obvious. They took my (and my cousins plate who ordered the same)  back, promised new sides and hot plate. This time veggies and potatoes hot, but the inside of the pot roast was cold. Might want to check in the re-heating protocol so you know the outcome.  Needless to say we were starving and ate our dishes anyways. \n\nI was not a fan of how this was handled and wasn't even offered a manager or a discount to appease this annoying situation. I feel like we were treated as is our business didn't matter because they are such a busy establishment. I won't be suggesting this restaurant any longer, whether I'm in Houston, Vegas, or Scottsdale..."
