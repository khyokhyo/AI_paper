            "review": "I really have no business being in places like these since I don't eat anything from the sea or any body of water (except tuna & tilapia) but my family really loves the stuff. \n\nWe showed up at their other location and the wait was too long for us (30min) because we had grumpy toddlers. We called this location and as luck would have it all we had to do was show up in the next 15min and we could be seated right away. \n\nI've never been to this one, but I like the ambiance a lot more in here than the other one...so much brighter. Honestly I can't be a reliable opinion on the crawfish or shrimp because I've never once tried even a lick. BUT I can tell ya what I thought about their chicken...?...if you're even interested to hear it haha...it's not at all the reason for people to visit here. The wings were good I guess, nothing special, no fancy sauces or spices. The fries mediocre. And the chicken nuggets...I'm almost 100% sure they were the ones you get in the freezer section at the grocery store, Tyson's. Also...I'm a ketchup snob, it is my own preference that the ketchup be Heinz and their's was definitely something generic. Everyone at the table who ate the crawfish and shrimp really enjoyed it, and their Cajun fries...I know that much. \n\nIt was pretty loud in there, and the other location is the same way. I really don't like having to yell my order at the server but it is what it is. My daughter didn't appreciate the noise level, so we ate quickly and I took her outside where we played while our family finished. But otherwise, very high energy...it's a fun place to go with a really great group of people."

I ran out of water because the heat level was so hot.\n\nIt's always nice to stop by Hot N Juicy whenever it's available. It's always a great experience with delicious cajun food. It is more on the pricey side but it is an experience that you will never forget.\n\nI usually go for the shrimp, sausage and corn combination. I always feel like the crab legs are over price here. If it's your first time here, start with a low heat level because it can get really really really hot."

We ordered crawfish and shrimp, both had a very bland taste and it was supposed to be the hot n juicy special medium. The staff that night acted like they didn't like their jobs. That visit may have been my last as the Boiling Crab is the other option.  Hot n Juicy needs to step up their game."

It's one of those places, \" O i always hate___ now i'm a fan!\"  \nYou buy the crawfish by the pound, and it comes to your table all steamed and evenly garliced.  This is the part where i think non seafood people will never understand.  You rip the lil heads apart from the body and give their brains a good little sucking.  It's absoutely delicious :) \nDont act like a bad ass and feel like you can take the heat, because their HOT is HOT.  No shame in ordering the mild, as it does have  a little bit of kick.  \nOverall big fan, and would wait come back here with my buddies anytime i'm in Vegas."

So we looked up(thanks to yelp!) similar places tgat are nearby so we ended up at this restaurant. We waited for less than 10 minutes, and from the moment we walked in, all the staff were very friendly and welcoming. We ordered one lb of snow crab legs, 2 lbs of shrimp with different sauce each, corn cob, 1/2 lb sausages and plain rice. I had the crab in hot and spicy sauce, it was delicious! The shrimp in mild sauce had great flavor as well. Overall, the food is phenomenal, service is awesome, and the atmosphere is just happy and bursting with happy people enjoying their food. I gave it 4 stars because I wished they had a station intended for hand washing only."

Second time was take-out and it seemed undercooked.\n\nEven though crawfish is in their name, to get the most bang for your bucks stick with shrimps and crabs as they have more meat whereas the crawfish is mostly shell.  The fried catfish was excellent & the french fries' portion was large and a good foil for the spicy sauce they boil their shellfish in."

The sweet potato fries are also delicious.\n\nSeasoning can be spicy so I normally get mild or less than mild.\n\nThe lemon butter sauce is in my opinion the best for the crab and the hot n juicy special sauce is better for the shrimp and crawfish. \n\nKeep in mind crawfish don't have a large amount of meat on them so these are best for an appetizer. \n\nService has always been good."

            "review": "Okay, I KNOW the place isn't as good as the Boiling Crab in the LA area, but it's all we have in Vegas. This second location is considerably larger than the first location. When I peeked inside, I was like holy shiz, it's so huge. Most likely I'll be coming here instead of the smaller location. Traffic here will be slow compared to the other one for now since it's just recently opened.\n\nMy friend wanted to try this out so we came here for his birthday. I usually get my delicious cajun fries (they're spicy!) and 1 pound of the mild Lemon Pepper seasoned shrimp. Pretty yummy. I don't like the Hot N Juicy Special seasoning (I tried my friend's). I just prefer the lemon pepper. Don't think I'll risk the other seasonings, but I will definitely try them if a friend gets them next time. I believe I've tried them at the other location, but don't recall any of them standing out except the lemon pepper.\n\nI absolutely adore the fries! Hell, just get the sweet potato fries and eat both of them. They both taste yummy. Just make sure you don't wear WHITE when you go eat as you might make a mess on yourself and just wear a dark-colored top. Yes, you get the bib but it doesn't cover all of you. With that being said, enjoy your seafood :)!"

We got 1lbs of shrimp in hot n juicy seasoning with mild spices, and 2lbs of snow crab legs with the same seasoning and spices. Everything was seasoned well and finger licking good. The meat of the crab was so tender and juicy. I loved the atmosphere. There were no silverware or plates just plastic table cloths and napkins. The price is very reasonable. We also got a fried shrimp appetizer and 2 soft drinks and our bill was less than 70 bucks. \n\nTwo thumbs up"

            "review": "I really wanted to have a whole crab so I rolled into this place. They did deliver a fresh dungeness crab; although, at a price. A price you wouldn't know if you didn't think to ask up front.\n\nNow, apparently according to some folks, if you see a price for crab or lobster on a board you assume it's per pound. Sure, maybe I've been living under a rock but if I see a price next to dungeness crab and there isn't \"/lb\" or \"per pound\" next to it, I'm going to think it's the price of the crab.  If you look at the menu it says \"market price\" but I've never read anything in economics advising that the unit of measure is always by pound. \n\nI've ordered seafood at many places, fish markets, casual and fine dining, from across the country and I have never been uncertain about what I was going to pay at the end. For example, at R & D in Newport Beach, they list fish as \"market price\" but the server will tell you exactly what the whole plate will cost.\n\nNow, I can't say what would've happened if I had known it was per pound and asked the server how much it's going to weigh, but it's a nasty surprise to somebody who didn't know how \"these places\" work. Nobody should have to make this mistake just to find out. Would it be that difficult to add per pound to the board or menu?  I can't recommend you eat here at Hot N Juicy Crawfish because if you aren't certain about how much you're going to get or what you're going to pay for it, it's not fair."

Still spicy but still so good. I tasted the corn fritters that weren't on the menu a year ago. Very good, but they should try serving it with something else other than catsup. I've had them served with hot pepper jelly elsewhere & it's a good combination.\n\nI didn't care much for our waitress, but the blond girl who rung us up was sooo nice.

Good news - I am heading to Vegas in a week (well good news for me and bad news for shellfish)!\n\nThis place is located in a predominantly Asian part of town in a strip mall and has a certain amount of sketchy feel to it -that makes it taste better.  You sit down and basically choose what type of shell fish you want - crab, shrimp, clams, or, of course, crawfish.  Then you choose the sauce.  I can't more highly recommend their special sauce.  Finally, you choose spice level.  Let me first say that I eat ghost pepper spice all the time - i.e. I LOVE HEAT.  However, I would recommend no hotter than medium.  Not necessarily because it is too spicy, but because of the level of garlic and oil -this  is a stomach explosion waiting to happen.\n\nSeriously, I love this place....LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!"

We got seated right away, but waited a good 10 minutes before our server even acknowledged us - at least we were ready to order.  We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters, sweet potato fries, 2 lbs of snow crab legs, 2 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, and bowl of rice for everyone.  The fries came out along with the oysters....but no water.  It was hard to flag someone down because we were sitting in the back of the restaurant and the servers were constantly going to the front.  We were practically done with our appetizers when the shrimp comes out.  OK, no water and no rice(hey, we're Filipino and we need our rice!)  Finally they bring us water along with everything else and we start munching down.  During the course of our meal we run out of water and we see our waitress asking the tables next to us if they wanted refills on their waters.  She had enough water to fill their cups and we thought \"great, she's gonna go refill her pitcher and come back to our table.\"  NOT!!  We constantly had to get up and ask them for stuff....not cool at all!!!  I don't care how busy you are - if you are a really good server you know how to take care of ALL your tables!!  The last time my cousin had to stand at the counter to ask for refills on our water another waitress came by to apologize for ignoring us.  At least they know they were ignoring us, but how convenient to apologize AT THE END when we have to pay.  Great food but lousy service!"

I went with a friend on a Sunday night and was able to get a table right away. The feel is definitely trendy and club like, they had some EDC music vibes going on. It was also nice that they had the football game on to cater to all the sports fans as well.\n\nNow to the food! We ended up sharing the calamari, lemon pepper shrimp and hot n juicy crawfish. My favorite seasoning was the hot n juicy, it had the perfect balance of basically every flavor and tasted great with the crawfish, corn and potatoes we got. I do have to knock this place one star only for the amount of work it actually takes to eat the crawfish and shrimp. You have to man handle these bad boys pretty good to get the meat out and another sucky part is your hands smelling like seafood for a few days after. They provide you with plastic gloves, but it's honestly so much harder to try to break the food apart while wearing them. Can't win em all I guess.\n\nOverall I'm super happy I finally stopped by and I'll definitely be back again soon. Can't wait to try something new!"

            "review": "I always visit this place when I'm in Vegas! It absolutely delicious here. Way better than boiling crab in California--San Jose, Sacramento, Alhambra, Orange County--and just as yummy as the Seafood Shack in Anaheim. The prices are relatively same as in Cali: $9.99/lb of shrimp. $10.99/lb of crawfish. $8.99/half a dozen of oysters. $24.99/lb of king crab legs. (They were out of dungess crab, which was disappointing). The sauce options were more than most places I've been to: Louisiana style, Cajun style, butter garlic, lemon pepper, and hot n juicy special. \n\nThis time I took my family here for dinner during our Christmas vacation in Vegas.  When our party of 5 arrived we were told the wait would be 25 minutes, but after 10 minutes we were seated. Our server was Mathew. He was completely awesome: Super nice, friendly, funny, and attentive. The oysters were so sweet! My father, hubby, and I gulped them down as soon as they came out--Matt dropped by to make sure we'd already gotten our oysters and was surprised we'd already finished them all. It was that good. We ordered the soft shell basket (fried soft shell crab on cajun fries) and everyone love that. Although, for $10.95 we should've gotten more than 6 pieces, it was mostly fries. The crawfish was juicy and succulent. However, most of them were on the small side. The king crab legs were huge and meaty. Near the end of dinner, my dad wanted another order of Cajun fries. Unfortunately, Matt forgot to put in our order right away that we didn't get it 'til after we paid for our dinner. Matt was totally responsible and owned up to his mistake. We got our fries @ a discount: FREE. :) \n\nTo conclude: the experience, the food, & the service was really good."

I'm solely basing this review on Hot N Juicay's medium special vs The new contender's medium whole shabang. \n\nWe got 4 pounds of snow crab, 1 pound of skrimps, and 1 pound of crawfish. I opt for the medium hot n juicy special for the seasoning. I saw white rice on the menu. WOOT!!! I'm not sure if they always served white rice here. I remembered asking for it at the original spot and got denied. Maybe they ran out back then. I was so glad to see it on the menu. I saw some cat post up a picture of rice that had the seasoning poured all over it. FOR REALLY DOE!!!\n\nNot very long after I was stuffing my face like a pig, the spice started to make me sweat, but I couldn't stop eating. Believe me, it was an ugly sight. Pieces of shell all on my grill, juice running down my arms, beads of sweat forming on my cranium, crab meat chillen on the upper lip...YO!\n\nBoth places have GREAT flavor, although Hot N Juicy's medium spice got it on LOCK DOWN!!! Doesn't need no more or no less. Keep doing it yallz! EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"

The gloves are much needed, otherwise your hands will smell like seafood. They're not very durable, so you'll need to switch them out periodically while eating.\nHad 1/2 pound of shrimp with a pound of Alaskan King Crab Legs. Both with mild hot and juicy seasoning. Perfect seasoning, I'm in love. I would give them 5 stars if the price was a little lower. For the Alaskan King Crap, it was $28/lb. I didn't really care for the shrimp because it came with the whole body (head and body in the shell). Although it was all tasty, the shrimp head just wasn't appealing to me. Other than that, the place was clean and we didn't wait long for a table. Unfortunately, the night we came, they were pretty understaffed and it was definitely noticeable. I will definitely be returning in the near future (but maybe to the other location instead)!!!!"

Your server will make sure your table is covered in plastic and when she presents you with your seafood, you can literally just dump it on the table and dig in! My snow crab was delicious, though you have to work for it by cracking the shells yourself. My corn fritters were not as great - kind of greasy and too bready, but that's not the main attraction.. There's a full bar to order cocktails should you desire to do so.. I opted for water as I was nursing a hangover, lol! The service was excellent and I can't wait to go again.

The ones during this visit hardly had any meat. The real deal are the shrimp. These big, plump, and juicy crustaceans steal the show.\n\nAt Hot N Juicy, start by picking a protein, followed by seasoning, then the spice factor and finish it off with extras that they will cook in all the juices. For four, we easily dined on one pound of Hot N Juicy Special Spicy Crawfish with two pieces of corn and potatoes, two pounds of HNJ Special Extra Spicy Shrimp with two pieces of corn, two potatoes and half a dozen pieces of sausage, and a basket of ten fried shrimp ($10.99). Most of the seafood are sold at market price, but they tend to stay between $10-$12. Corn are .75, potatoes are .60, and the half portion of sausage was $2.75. The fried shrimp were not a favorite. The cornmeal batter is great for crispiness, but I could barely spot any shrimp. It end up feeling like I was eating friend bread. Beers are cheap for a restaurant. $2.75 for Bud, Bud Light, and Miller Light. $3 for Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon. For a quarter more, I am down with getting the import beers. \n\nThe service was decent tonight. Our server was quick to refill our water cups. Even one that wasn't ours refilled our cups. Our server did look disappointed that our order was so small, but it was more than enough for us. At a little over $60, the bill is not a cheap meal.

Everyone else, including those who arrived closer to 8pm ordered and received their food before my friend did. We inquired 3 times about his order, making sure his order was in fact taken. We were reassured that it was. In the interim, my friend was so hungry. He was able to get bits and pieces from what the rest of us ordered. At 8:35pm, over an hour after he ordered he got his lobster. \n\nWhen I spoke to Jillian, the manager on duty that night about the situation, her reply was \"There's nothing we can do. It's Friday night and we're dealing with two big groups.\" Excuse me, but if you're establishment is so popular, yet you are not prepared to handle such business, then perhaps you don't deserve to be so busy. I mean there are plenty of places that would either employ enough staff to handle their clientele. At the very least Jillian could've offered a discount or something. Her nonchalant non-cooperative attitude was less than desirable. \n\nI would also add that the lack of greens (collard, okra, spinach) would make me rethink visiting any HnJ anywhere. \n\nThe bright side of all this was Cassandra who was a positive and enthusiastic server, hence any stars whatsoever."

XD Even having other places open with similar type and style, i still eventually come back to be completely satisfied. \n\nI remember going to the original location, up the street, closer to Decatur a few times before this location opened. Due to the years that one's been running, and the small \"enclosed\" location, i was happy when this one opened. I believe it was called a different name before this one opened but it was similar in style. After that one closed, Hot n Juicy took over !\n\nMy best friend and I were happy. More open location. Brighter. Newer ! ! AND LESS SMELLY ! \n\nParking can be a pain sometimes due to it being in a plaza with other popular restaurants like DJK and Pho Kim Long but still worth it. AND its still technically down the street from my house xD just a little farther down spring mountain than the original location.... \n\nMost TVs are easily viewable from almost any seat in the restaurant for those who love to watch sports or just to watch something while eating. \n\nPrices for shrimp and crawfish is at $11.99/lb (As of 01/31/16). \n\nMy usual is Hot n Juicy Special (medium or spicy or maybe extra spicy - depending on the day) + a corn (MMMM SOAKS UP ALL THAT FLAVOR) and shared cajun fries (ketchup does cut the spice sometimes XD)\n\nTIP: If you are like me and my friends, who refuse to use those oversized gloves... clean your hands BEFORE going to the restroom with some wedges of lemon. Lemon juice cuts smell and cleans well before you go to scrub up some more and finish off in the restroom :)"

The experience is raw and very satisfying. \n\nWe did the shrimp and catfish. The shrimp was great and they came to us fully intact  (heads and all). As a Cajun I know all about peeling off the heads and eating the delicious meat. Loved the experience.\n\nThe catfish was not good. It came deep fried like it had used grease saved from years past. The insides (meat) was greasy too. Just don't get it.\n\nGo here if you want great seafood in a raw manner."

The restaurant was its usual busy 90% occupied with parking hard to find in this Valley View & Spring Mountain plaza. My friends ate the crawfish and they were ginormous!  The shrimp were also huge as I took an extra pound home. Hot n Juicy mild sauce was on point. \n\nThe catfish and calamari were okay but this is to be expected from battered deep fried seafood. I honestly believe these guys are about equal to Cajun Crawfish as well as Boiling Crab. The sauce at this location has a little more taste than the others but they are close to equal."

My waitress was very helpful and explained everything to me, I even was given a crawfish sample as it was my first time trying them. I ordered the hot and juicy mild crawfish and garlic shrimp. Boy was it tasty. You definitely are going to need gloves to tear these guys apart, as they are saturated with the sauces. DONT BE AFRAID to get down and dirty. Personally, I enjoyed the shrimp more because there is a lot more meat, they are healthy shrimp. The crawfish have tiny tails but are equally as tasty. If you are going solely to eat the crawfish and have a big appetite, you're going to need a few pounds of those bad boys. Overall, great experience and will be back soon, hopefully visiting the California location."

Depending on time of day but dinner time it usually is busy so expect to wait for a bit for a table.\n\nPretty simple menu to read and they offer a few selection of seafood by the pound. It depends how much based on the market price of the day but it is not too bad. \n\nFirst you order what seafood you want and how many pounds. Usually a pound or 2 is good per person. Next is the type of seasoning and then the spice level. Servers usually warn you that the medium spice level is kind of spicy. \n\nThere is also a back side of the menu where they offer sides such as corn, rice, rolls etc. They also offer domestic and premium beers as well.\n\nI usually order a pound of shrimp and their hot n juicy sauce which is a combination of all their sauces mixed together. I also order a corn mixed with the sauce and side of sweet potato fries.\n\nThe seafood you order delivers in a hot bag with the sauce of your choice. The shrimp you have to peel the skin yourself which makes the experience fun and enjoyable. You could also ask for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to add a little more taste to your food. \n\nIf you don't like getting messy, they have gloves you can use and oh they also give you a plastic bib too so you won't make a mess on your shirt because it could get messy.\n\nThere is a huge roll of paper towel so there is plenty to go around if you need to clean up. \n\nOverall the food taste great. Came out in a reasonable amount of time. Food is nice and hot. Our drinks were always topped off.\n\nThanks!"

Just be sure you do not have paper cuts on your hands, you'll definitely get a sting, but it's so good that you ignore it and keep eating.  I read a handful of reviews and aside from the crawfish, many recommended the fried shrimp. Of course it was ordered and they were definitely right.  The cornmeal batter was not piled on the butterflied shrimp so that it's lost.  Another thing too is the batter stuck to the shrimp. It came out piping hot, enjoyed every bit of it.\n\nShowtime.  I decided to go with 2 pounds of the crawfish, hot and juicy special sauce and I went with medium spice level.  I asked the server for spicy, but she highly recommended medium because it's rather spicy.  I was hesitant at first since, but fine, I went with it, what do I know. I chose or well, she did, correctly.  The hot and juicy special sauce was full of fresh garlic, delicious!  I ordered a side of rice, piled on the sauce into the rice bowl, highly recommended.  The crawfish was hit or miss.  I say this because some were larger than others, some where cooked right, some were so overcooked, the tail had zippy in it.  Regardless, it was still an experience and worth it.  Twist, suck, pull, chomp.\n\nService was good as busy as this place was.  Beers are cheap, can't complain.

I could eat it on anything!\n\nI do, however have a HUGE complaint - their service.  We came around 4:30 before the rush hour dinner crowd arrived.  We were seated and our order was taken.  Fast forward 45 minutes and the place started to fill up and people who arrived 20-30 minutes after us placed their orders and were already eating and we still didn't even have our drinks!  We beckoned a server over (because we didn't know who our waiter/waitress was since 3 different people had come to our table) and asked why we haven't yet been tended to.  She looked into it and said that our orders had not been put into the computer so they were going to discount our tab to compensate and that a manager was going to come speak to us about it.  Soon after our meals were served, however, it was delivered to us piece-meal.  We had to remind her twice what items we were missing.  While we were dining, no one checked on us during our meal so we had to continue to flag her down to get refills on our drinks.  No manager had come, as promised, and when our bill came, it was not discounted and once again we had to remind her that no one came to discuss the bill with us and that it was not discounted either.\n\nThank GOD the food was amazing because if I were to base my review on service alone, this place would receive zero stars.  I could probably give it closer to 5 stars but bad service taints ones eating enjoyment and needless to say the food probably would have been that much better had I not been so upset about the subpar service."

They wanted to know what day I dined so that they could investigate to find out what may have gone wrong with my meal.

Every restaurant can have a bad day, or bad product that is unknown as the product was properly prepared.\n  Everyone else in the place was having a great time and loving the food.  I heard no complaints, just praise, and trust me there is no way I could not hear what the people were saying ;-D.  This restaurant was listed in the top 30 must eat meals in Las Vegas and I can see why.  While I may have had some difficulties, I would still recommend eating there to other friends, especially if they want to have a good time with their meal.\n  Based on the chance my experience was unique, that everything I did eat was very tasty, and that this company cares as much as they do - I will be going back again another day to give them another chance.  I hope it's good.  This is the kind of place I would like to bring a group of friends to for a tasty meal and a great time - something everyone else in the place seemed to be having that night.  Service was excellent in any case."

I got pound of shrimp with hot and juicy seasoning mild and it was good. My friend got their fried shrimp and I got to try it and that was pretty good. The breading was the best.\n\nIf I'm ever in the area again I will probably go with the calamari seeing as it looked good. The Cajun fries were also good. \n\nAlso had pretty good service which I liked. All in all I would go back next time I'm in Vegas."

The service is always a bit slow, but nothing unbearable. We ordered 3lbs shrimp, one had to be sent back because they were cooked too long and wouldn't peel & we ordered a 2lb lobster. Shrimp were very good, seasoning excellent, but the lobster severely lacked in flavor. Also had to wait 5 minutes after the lobster was delivered to receive the cracker tool to eat the lobster. Cajun calamari is good, small portion though. Overall, I would go back, just not waste money on the lobster & also expect a wait to be greeted and place order."

My friend joined me that year and agreed that Hot N Juicy was just that. Since we had a group of 10+ we ordered almost everything on the menu except for the crawfish and lobster. I probably ate my weight in shrimp and crab. The side dishes were a mere afterthought. I did enjoy the corn and rice. Come on, I had to have some rice with the proteins!\n2nd experience:\n\"Dude, I think the guy at the front is hitting on you.\" Our waiter proceeds to act awfully friendly to my co-worker. We picked on him for the rest of the evening. It was cute!\nI was in town for a convention for work. My boss treated us to dinner here. I was so excited since I already knew what to expect. We all ordered our own crab and shared shrimp and sides. The Hot N Juicy special sauce all the way! I learned the ways of H&J.\nLast notes:  If you're in it to win it, go for the H&J special sauce mild. Medium to me seems too spicy, but that's just me.  I'm the type that can't handle Hot Cheetos....This place gets super crowded so it's best to try to get there before the dinner rush if you can."

You have to peel the crawdads and shrimp, which is fine, more flavor up in there that way, but it's so overcooked the meat turns to mush and your fingers will stink of farm-raised crawfish from god-knows-what southeast asian cesspool and garlic for days.\n\nBleccch.\n\nDon't know why I went back."

I visited the original place in LV a while back and thought the place was decent. Well, this location gives the whole concept a nice face lift with a spacious and casual dining room and a cool-looking bar you can seat at if you are by yourself. Being a saucy peel-and-eat seafood place, please expect a messy experience...and table, and hands, bib, etc. This is a unique eating experience to be shared with friends over a few beers, as long as everyone at the table is willing to work a bit for their food (peeling can be tedious).\n\nI ordered the lemon pepper shrimp with no oil (I was actually impressed the cooks prepared my order fat-free) and my girl ordered the butter garlic crawfish. The seasoning was very good but a bit spicy, specially if you are not into spicy foods at all. My pound of shrimp was very flavorful and each shrimp was plump and perfectly cooked. On the other hand, the pound of crawfish was awful- tiny crawfish with little or no meat in them...A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I cannot say this enough...JUST GET THE SHRIMP!\n\nImportant tips:\n* Be ready for a messy experience. If you do not like eating with your hands and perhaps getting splashed with shrimp sauce, this place is not for you.\n\n* Get the shrimp and not the crawfish. Also, get two pounds of it if you are hungry.\n\n* They charge 60 cents for a tiny potato! You are better off getting some rice on the side.\n\n* Expect to spend about $15 per person.\n\n* Even no spicy IS a bit spicy."

You will be keeping all vampires and trampires (K-Stew) away for at least a few days......\n\n1 Ambiance - 4 star - for an asian strip mall, where you expect nothing, you get a nice, large place, high ceilings, decent decor, room to wait and plenty of table and chairs. You are in a busy area, so parking is easy / not easy.  It is crowded.\n\n2.  Service - 5 star - Everyone here is young and very pleasant. I think that people here enjoy working here, enjoy explaining the in and out of what to do and how to order. I really enjoy the staff here. \n\n3  Food - 5 star - Wow, amazing, tasty and an experience that adds to the overall feeling.\n\na.  Shrimp - Large, tender, juicy, filling, easy to peel.\nb.  Crawfish - Well, they are crawfish, eat the tail only, a small bit of meat and tasty, just a lot of work to get to the tiny morsel of meat...\nc.  They have plenty of other choices, blue crab, snow crab, dungeness, lobster, mussels and more.  I just stuck to shrimp and crawfish.\nd.  Sauces - We try the Lemon Pepper and the Hot Juicy in mild and medium. Yummy and not too hot.  \ne.  Quantity - Easy to order more, generally 1 lb of shrimp per person at least and 2 lb of crawfish per person.  you get a potato and corn with 2 lb order of the crawfish!  Doesn't seem like enticing, however, when you are burning calories just to eat, to chow down on a marinated corn or potato is nice and different.\n\n4.  Price - All are market price, however, for three of us eating about 7 - 8 lb of food, I generally spend about 30.00 per person, which is a good deal for seafood.  \n\n5.  Toilets - OK, this place must be owned by an asian person because the toilets need to be modernized or cleaned...  Hey, we are going here for the toilets though......\n\nGK says, great place.

We got the shrimp first and it was really, really good! We chose medium spicy and it was perfect. Only $7.99!  Not too shabby.  Then we got the crawfish. Tiny, overly spicy (medium too), and NO MEAT!  I didn't expect it to be that meaty, but I'm talking TINY. We asked the server and she did admit we came off season and the meat is pretty much non-existent, but we wish someone told us first and we would have gotten more shrimp instead.\n\nWasn't busy on a Thursday afternoon. This is the newer location and it was clean and plenty of parking. Not too far from the strip if you drive."

We had great service, and I think the price is very good.  One thing though, I asked the server where they get the crawfish and she said Louisiana.  Find that hard to believe because they aren't in season, unless they freeze them.  The crawfish is small.  But everything else is really good, especially the shrimp.  We had the mild...my friend is a wimp...but it was very tasty.  Next time I go, getting the extra spicy!!!"

That said, the exposed brick, checked table clothes and local feel makes it a treat.\n\nCost: 5. For once, we can all beat Vegas.  Even with a sub-$10 cab fare from the strip, H 'n J is still very affordable for what you get.  A pound each of crawfish, shrimp, and kind crab with sides and drinks did not top $60 with tip.  Meal would cost at least 2x that at the casinos, I almost don't want to share the secret for fear they jack the prices.\n\nFood Quality: 4. H 'n J serves its seafood in plastic bags they've mixed the seasonings in.  No plates, no rules -- it gets messy.  But it's so good, you don't care.  It was my first shelled crawfish experience -- quite tender, but a lot of work to open up their apparently smaller than average crawfishes.  Shrimp were good, king crab legs were AWESOME.  Lemon pepper and Hot 'n Juicy special seasoning were probably the two best choices to go with -- for heat lovers, go with at least medium spice for flavors.\n\nService: 5. Waitress great, she walked us through the crawfish de-shelling process on arrival, as well as several menu questions on what to order, how much of it, and seasoning flavors.\n\nWhen to return: When you need to get off the Strip and the f out of dodge, a cheap but great seafood meal, when you're not looking to get lucky in the following 6 hours."

This was probably the closest I would get, since they don't have it in Chicago. I was a little disappointed by the crawfish, because the shell was super thick and hard, and there was just something a little different about the sauce. I still ate like a beast, don't get me wrong. I mean how can you not be a little messy when you eat with your hands and there's sauce everywhere...but I think I really would have enjoyed it a lot more if the crawfish was like what they give you at Boiling Crab. Maybe they're from a different region? It really makes a difference if their shells are so hard, makes it difficult to peel. And the taste of the crawfish meat was even different! Almost like it was a \"lower grade\" of seafood meat.\n\nAnyway, we also ordered clams, crab legs, and shrimp. I really enjoyed the crab legs and clams, and the shrimp was pretty good too. We got fries to share, which was a welcomed distraction for our tongues after too much spicy/garlic-y goodness. I loved the corn on the cob, as usual."

I've been trying to come here for a few times, and even went once but the wait was too long for a large party. \n\nThis time, my lil sister Jenni took me here Saturday night around 7pm for dinner - just the two of us this time. This is Hot N Juicy II, a little further east than I, and the place seems more updated and less crowded than I. \n\nIt's such a fun environment. The waitresses are all super nice and laid back, there is Top 40 radio going on in the background, and everyone is eating with their hands! The wait a table for Jenni and I was about 20 minutes. \n\nI love crawfish but the shrimp was recommended to get more bang for your buck and also because they're delicious, of course! We each got a pound of shrimp in the Hot N Juicy Special sauce (which is a combination of all the sauces they offer). The food came out in about 10 minutes, hardly any wait. The mild was a tiny bit spicy for me (I'm a big spice pansy) but perfect for that extra kick. The shrimp that arrived were perfectly seasoned in that amazing sauce, and were each a good size. We also got an order of sweet potato fries that were super tasty, well seasoned, and a generous portion at that. This was definitely the right amount of food for the two of us. \n\nOur bill for 2 lbs of shrimp and an order of sweet potato fries came to be around $26 without tip. Not bad for a seafood dinner. \n\nTip: Jenni, a seasoned HNJC customer, recommends that you keep your wardrobe in mind when coming here. You tend to leave with your clothes smelling a little like garlic, and the scent definitely sticks on your hands for at least a day. :)"

Food and wanted to try it. The crawfish are cooked perfectly and did in fact taste as though they were flown in from Louisiana every morning. I asked the server which part but he didn't know.  \n    The spices I tried were the traditional Louisiana and the Hot n Juicy special, both with medium spice. They were both excellent. The traditional is very similar to the crawfish boils I use to have in the backyard with my family. I initially got two pounds but then got another two pounds after that. At 10 bucks a pound, be prepared to spend about $60.00 for two people. \n    We also tried the sausage and sweet potatoe fries, again both were great. The fries were made to order and the sausage was very flavorful. My only complaint is that the potato that the comes with the crawfish (if you order two pounds) is very plain. It tasted like they boiled it by itself and then just threw it in with the crawfish. But anyone from New Orleans knows that the potatoes must be boiled with the crawfish and have the potential to be the most flavorful piece of food in the boil. My wife was also disappointed with the corn on the cob that was included, she stated that it tasted like it was just a cheap frozen corn. Im definitely going to revisit when I goto Las Vegas again."

Went to Hot & Juicy instead, got super lucky and was seated in 10 minutes. \n\nPick your seafood of choice (dungeness crab, blue crab, king crab, snow crab legs, lobster, clams, shrimp or crawfish), how many pounds, sauce (Louisiana style, garlic butter, lemon pepper, juicy cajun, or hot & juicy -- which is all combined), choose your spice level (baby spice, mild, medium, spicy, extra spicy), pick additives (corn on the cob, potatoes, sausage, etc)... AND WATCH THE MAGIC UNFOLD! Everything gets mixed up in a plastic bag, served hot. Tables are covered with plastic & you are given plastic bibs. They provide plastic gloves, but what's the fun in that? Tie up your hair, roll up your sleeves and get in there! \n \nWe order the same thing:\n- A POUND OF SHRIMP, HOT & JUICY WITH TWO CORNS. Not a fan of spicy foods, I opt for \"baby spice\" and he goes for mild. We both also get a side of rice! \n\nTIP: They also give you little cups of salt & pepper and lemon wedges. Squeeze those babies in there and they make a zesty dipping sauce! \n\nCON: Do not go here hoping to do much afterwards. Your hair, nails, clothes, purse, life in general will leave with an intense garlic/shrimp aroma that will not leave until you shower and wash your clothes! :D"

I'm in a wheelchair so I got prime parking. =P  \n\nWent with a buddy who I havent seen since high school , his fiance and kid. Greeted warmly by the hostess and seated promptly .... This place gets packed fast so do what we did and arrive at 6pm or earlier. We went on saturday 07/02/11 a holiday weekend. All the waitresses were as the restaurant name says \"Hot n Juicy\" looking!! Not too shabby !! \n\nwe ordered ....\n\n1 Catfish Tray \n2 pounds crawfish\n1 chicken tray\n1 clams \n2 orders of rice\n1 etouffe\n1 pound garlic butter shrimp\n\nThe Catfish was awesome ..... Lightly Breaded on top of a bed of fries.... Didnt have the fries coz I'm trying to watch my Girly Figure.... =P  I had the crawfish Louisiana style w mild spices..... Simply delicious!  Albert ( my buddy from high school ) had the etouffe and a crawfish medium spice in garlic butter.  I'm a Crawfish rookie ....loved the flavor ....didnt like the tiny reward for breaking open those lil bastards! Took a bite of the garlic butter shrimp and know what I'm ordering the Next time I come here!!\n\nJust like a previous reviewer said  \"You know this place is bangin' when you're nose is drippin and you don't even know it.\" I was told by Lorena ( my buddies fiance) that I was sweating on my head..... I seriously didnt realize it!! The food is THAT GOOD!!\n\nDefinitely coming back for another round!! Great Place!!\n\nOH!! I forgot to mention that our waitress brought us a bill from another table for only 20.00 ........ rather than a bill for 80.00 which it should be.... This was one of those What Would you Do kind of moments.... Just pay 20.00 ? or bring it to our waitresses attention..... We decided to bring it to our waitresses attention and she was so appreciative of that !! I would'nt feel right paying 20.00 for what we ate AND I would feel guilty knowing that the waitress would have to take a cut from her check for her error..... DO WHATS RIGHT PEOPLE!!  Do whats right!! nuff said....."

We first went to the original one and saw the line was too long so we came to this one which I met up with some other people. I ordered 2lbs of the spicy garlic butter and calimari. My friend ordered the 4lbs of extra spicy lousiana style which he shared with his gf. The spicy garlic butter was amazing, it was not too spicy and not too garlicy flavored. The extra spicy was really spicy but still enjoyable. My friend mentioned that the garlic butter he had in the DC location had too much garlic that it was not too appetizing.\n\nWhen I pointed out that the owner was there, we mentioned it to him and he was really cool about and appreciated our feed back. Hope the cooks in DC gets more training because I look forward in eating at that location."

My friends told me Hot N Juicy took over the old Cajun Crawfish but made a few improvements to the space and decor. We were even more surprised by how good looking all the servers are. (We learned later on that a new reality show is going to start filming there so I assumed that's why they hired some hot-for-TV servers).\n\nWe went around 7 pm on a Friday night and it was pretty full but our group of 5 people and a baby were seated promptly. (A huge advantage over the original location.) We were tended to by a few different waitresses who were all very nice and tired a bib around each of our necks. \n\nI ordered fried calamari for appetizer and a lb. of snow crab legs with garlic and butter sauce, medium level of spiciness. On that day, market price for snow crab legs was $16.99.  I had wanted Dungeness crab but they were all out. I got a side of rice and requested for lime and salt and pepper on the side. Everything was so flavorful and delicious! The medium heat was a little too hot for me and my lips were on fire but I still enjoyed every bite of my meal."

I hadn't been back since then and after a night of staying out until the wee Vegas hours and a late night performance, my dance team and I were looking to get our grub on. We decided that this would be a great way to enjoy spending time together while eating yummy, spicy, Cajun goodness.\n\nThere were 17 of us so we were surprised that they could accommodate a party that large. We had to split up into 2 different tables, which that wasn't a problem for us. We're not high maintenance like that :) we were able to still interact and even share food!\n\nThey took our order right away and the food came out shortly. I ordered a 1/2lb. of shrimp, Mild, with all of the sauces, corn on the cob, white rice and Cajun fries to share. PLENTY of food and I ate ALL of it. Their \"mild\" was more like medium/hot. It was really funny watching everyone sweating from their food. I had a couple of friends order Medium or hot and they were DYING. So be careful if you're sensitive to spice levels because it's NOT what you will expect. Luckily, I LOVE spicy foods so the mild being medium/hot was a blessing in disguise. I'm pretty sure I thought about seconds and even packing leftovers because it was just THAT good \n\nat the end of the meal, they were amazing enough to split the check for us. It was an awesome dining experience. \n\nNote: there's another Hot & Juicy location down the way so if you're going to meet up with friends, make sure you specify which one on Spring Mountain Rd. PARKING IS LIMITED."

I didn't know the exact address, so I told him to just search for the Hot N Juicy by name and go to the one closest to the Wynn.  He immediately thought I was trying to steer him to some other type of establishments hidden in plain sight throughout Las Vegas.\n\nAt Hot N Juicy, where the girls on average are pretty, the service is very friendly and attentive, Hot n Juicy Special is always on the menu, individual experiences can be customized from Mild to Extra Spicy, you can definitely treat your mouth to a messy but happy ending.  And today only, you can enjoy it with a 2-for-1 special*.\n\nCome early and expect to wait at least 40 minutes, or take up the offer of a free limo shuttle service to Hot n Juicy (original location) where the food is the same, but without the wait and the services of the Hot N Juicy All-Star waitresses.  Again, the limo is presumably for the Grand Opening promotion only.\n\nSpicy level is supposedly a little higher than other places, so customize accordingly.  1 pound of crawfish may sound like a lot, but it really is not, as most of the weight is contributed by the lobster-mini-me shells.  If crawfish is not your thing, shrimp, lobster, clams, and various crabs (Dungeness, Blue, Snow and King), and raw oysters can be ordered.\n\nYou can add the following sides to your above orders:\nCorn, potato, sausage, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, bowl of rice, rolls and even extra seasoning sauce.\n\nAppetizers include Fried Shrimp, Fried Catfish, Soft Shell Crab, Calamari, Chicken Wings and Etouffee.\n\nWhat I like about this place?  \"It is bigger on the inside\".  The waitresses remind me of Suicide Girls.  Perfect place to visit to satisfy your spicy food craving. In case there is a wait for the use of the restrooms or you have a tendency to stare at the waitresses, you have portraits of the lovely Hot N Juicy Girls to check out.  Or you can just pretend there is a line for the lavatory.\n\nWhat I don't like or care for:  Shrimp are not de-veined.  The parking here can be a pain, as it can be rather scarce during peak hours.  Not to mention some less than proficient drivers to deal with.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my Hot N Juicy dining experience.  The food was pretty good, but dining here is more of a social activity for me. And if you have a problem with eating with your hands and getting messy, it is best to patronize a different establishment, otherwise enjoy!\n\nAmbiance:  4/5  Roomy, with fishing theme decor adorning the walls and pictures of the Hot N Juicy waitresses on the hallway wall leading to the restrooms.\nCleanliness:  5/5  It is new, but I hope they keep it looking that way.\nFood:  4/5  Nothing extraordinary, but it is enjoyable and fun.\nPrice: 3/5  About what you expect.  The main items are all priced at \"Market or Seasonal Price\", which for shrimp and crawfish are around the $10 mark.\nLocation:  4/5  Definitely close enough to the Strip for the out-of-towners to take a cab here.\n\nPretty solid 4 Yelp stars.\n\n*Buy 1 pound of crawfish get the 2nd pound free, all day until it is sold out."

Unfortunately, I left pretty underwhelmed after my visit last week after trying my Hot N Juicy medium spicy crawfish.\n\nPositives: the flavor was quite good. It had the perfect amount of heat, spice, garlic, and all other types of yumminess. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.\n\nNegatives: I'll start in chronological order from when I got there. Seeing the 10.99/lb price tag was like a slap to the face! I'm used to paying a fraction of that price for larger, fresher, and equally tasty crawfish. This leads me to my second point: many of the crawfish were mushy, tiny, and some of the tails weren't attached to the heads. Disappointing...\n\nNegatives continued...the service left something to be desired. While the server was very enthusiastic, she had difficulty understanding basic concepts. If you order 2 lbs of the crawfish, you automatically get a potato and corn included with your order. She charged my friend for an extra order of corn and potato to my friend's receipt and could not grasp why this was incorrect. Who knows how many other people have been upcharged for extra corn and potatoes. She didn't know how to remove this from the receipt so my friend ended up paying for something extra she didn't ask for because she didn't want to deal with the headache of explaining this again and again. :/\n\nIn summary, it seems like this is a popular place that many people frequent and even give great reviews and high accolades. It may be disappointing for people who have easy access to crawfish, have been to many'a crawfish boils, and know what good crawfish should taste like. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see what all the hype is about, but I'll get my crawfish-fix elsewhere."

The answer is, \"Finger licking good!\" And let me tell you, Hot n Juicy is the definition of finger licking good cause I will always be licking my fingers afterwards! \n\nThis place is delicious. I moved out of Las Vegas for a period of time and whenever I visited this city, I always always always have to eat at Hot n Juicy at least ONCE. It is always a must! The flavors are unique and different. No, I didn't come here due to \"Man vs. Food\" .. in fact, I never watched that show. I came here because I heard it was good and their first location was ALWAYS packed! The wait is always humongous! \n\nAnd yes, there are actually two locations and this one is their second location on Spring Mountain. It's newer so the decor is more modern and the ventilation should be a whole lot better than their first building. \n\nSo you don't like crawfish? That's fine. I don't really have a preference for them either. In fact, I think they're not really worth it. Each crawfish doesn't have much meat ... you'll be eating a few tons before you get full! Why? Well, Hot n Juicy sells it by the pound ... so with the little amount of actual edible goodness you get that comes in the huge clanky shells, you don't get much. But no worries! There is SHRIMP on the menu!! Of course, there's crab and whatnot on the menu too but that's not my concern. SHRIMP is my recommendation and it will fill you up for sure!!\n\nSo what they do is sell seafood by the pound. You get to choose a sauce and the spicyness level between mild and extra spicy. The shrimp is cooked in the sauce and they bring it to you in a plastic bags. Yes, it's different. Yes, you may not like being served food still in the bag. Sure, you may not like using your hands and they got plastic gloves for you folks. But it is YUMMYLICIOUS. Prepare to get messy ;) It's honestly worth a try ... get adventurous once in a while. You never know what you'll come across!\n\nI typically order 1 lb of shrimp. Hot n Juicy special. Add corn to that. As for the spicyness level, it depends on my mood. I have tried mild, medium, and spicy. Mild is the best and their mild is not the traditional mild. It's actually spicier than what people would consider mild. It is delicious with a little kick to it that gives it an oomph. Medium, to me, was very similar to the mild ... no real big difference. Now, spicy, that's the REAL kicker! It was SO GOOD. SO SPICY. SO FLAMING HOT. But honestly, go for the mild. \n\nI usually also order the cajun fries. They used to make them as regular fries with cajun powder on top but now they've incorporated the two? Who knows how they go about it but it's pretty good. \n\nSo their sauces have a lot of garlic in them. You'll be eating and smelling garlic all night. Be sure you're a garlic lover! You'll even take the smell home so be careful of what you wear and what you bring in! Make sure they're all easily washable :D \n\nAnd a tip...if you're using your hands to eat, make sure to ask the waitress for some limes/lemons. After you finish eating, wipe your hands with the paper towels to get rid of ALL sauces on your hands. Then you wash and rub your hands with the lime/lemon. Do it thoroughly. It should take off a good deal of the smell away from your hands. Then you just wipe your hands again to get rid of the lemony goodness and wash your hands the regular way! :D\n\nAnd now I'm craving some Hot n Juicy after writing this review!"

I always order baby spice hot n juicy shrimp. I would get mild, but their definition of mild is not the same as an average person's definition. It is too spicy. And the servers can have some improvement. They are not very good at checking on tables unless I flag them down. But still good."

But there's really nothing better than tearing into some crab with your friends while drinking a beer. \n\nWe started off with the calamari, it was tough and chewy. The battering was great, but the calamari itself tastes terrible and had a bad consistency. I think they have some of the best fried shrimp in Vegas! Great taste and ask to have some hot n juicy spicy on the side for dipping the shrimp and everything else! \n\nThe snow crab and shrimp were by far the star of the show for me. The shrimp was soooooo good. Firm and delicious, and much easier to peel open than the ones I've had a the other Cajun spots in Vegas. The snow crab was huge and really amazing in flavor. Full of meat and easy to crack open. I asked for a second order of snow crab with no sauce because I loved the taste of the crab and liked to dip it myself into a side of sauce. Don't forget to order corn and potato in the bag!\n\nOverall, this has to be my favorite Cajun spot in Vegas, by far! Great restaurant to come to with the family and get messy! Great seafood, great experience, and great sauces!"

They came with new potatoes and corn on the cob. The place just wasn't working it's magic(maybe mojo took the day off) and asked that the food be bagged so we could get out of their as soon as possible. I think I hurt my dates feelings, because she took a cab home.\nIf I'd known how bad crawfish tasted I would have given her mine as well. So, on the way home I tried me a mudbug. It was awful.

They give you gloves and bibs, which are a little bit pointless, because you end up smelling like sauce and garlic over your entire self, no matter what you do!! \n\nLike a regular 'seafood and sauce' place, everything is styled so you can pick your food and basically make it how you want it. Because I'm a poor college student, I always get shrimp in the Hot N Juicy in medium or mild! And if you're Asian, like me, you know you're spending on that bowl of rice! Unless you're on some diet that day. But let's face it, you're at Hot N Juicy, you came to eat!! \n\nSometimes, when I save up money, I'm able to upgrade myself to crab legs and raw oysters..you know, on special occasions and such :) \n\nIf you like a lot of meat, I would suggest crab or shrimp, since they really have the most worthwhile amounts of that. The crawfish are actually really small here, and I'm not a fan of the taste, anyway. \n\nIt is a great place to go when you're hungry! Just scrub, scrub, scrub when you're at home, because the smell will take a bit of work to get rid of!!"

My beef is with the seasoning. I've been to many a boil bag seafood places and was blown away by the taste. Yes, there was alot of sauce but for some reason none of it stuck with the meat?!? Once the seafood was extracted, shucked, cracked, peeled or decapitated, there was not much taste left?!?  Maybe they didn't let our stuff soak long enough in the bag? I know that it's possible because I've eaten at other places and the sauce penetrated (hehe) the shells and soaked into the meat. So yah it was a bit of a disappointment for me. \n\nQuestions:\nWhy do they only serve corn and potato with the crawfish? (notice the singulars) I wish that they offered it with all of their bags. When we drop $200 + on a seafood feast, that's the last that can can do. How do you decide who get the one potato or corn among 5 people? Don't nickel and dime us when we are spending mad money here. \n\nWhy do they not have mixed bags?

I came with 8 other people so we ordered a whole lot of shrimps and crawfishes. Got 2 lbs of the hotnjuicy special crawfish and 2 lbs of garlic butter shrimp, 2 lbs of lemon pepper shrimp, 1 lb of louisiana style shrimp, 2 orders of sweet potato fries, 1 order of cajun fries, and some rice. The bibs and gloves they provide are very handy, and you should change your gloves once or twice during your eating period because the sauces definitely leak through and you'll be stuck smelling like cajun for a few hours or days after. The crawfish were a bit of a struggle for me to break into, but the sauce did it for me, so good and with a kick (my lips were for sure burning way after finishing eating). We started taking shots of balls of rice with the different sauces on top, DELISH! The shrimps had a significant amount more meat than the crawfish an were easier to peel. The cajun fries order got lost somewhere during the meal, but they were pretty nice about getting the order to us as fast as possible. \n\nThis place is definitely worth trying and won't break the bank!"

They were a bit pricey compared to Texas at $10.99lb and I also ordered the snow crab legs which were $16.99lb... The sweet potato Cajun fries were amazing as well!. They don't serve wine or champagne by the glass so I had to purchase an entire bottle for $24.99. I ordered the hot and juicy special and the spice level was HOT! They were awesome!"

I so appreciate the fact that they give plastic gloves here so burning your hands is not an issue. I wish they did this in the Bay but I'll live ha. \n\nThe adults ordered a lb of the shrimp each with a side of the cajun fries and some regular fries for the kiddies (they had just eaten so it was enough for them lol). \n\nMost of the shrimp were cooked pretty well, some were over-cooked but I still ate them because the seasoning was so good. The cajun fries, while delicious, were wayyy too spicy for me (Note: I'm such a baby when it comes to spices so while this may not be spicy to some, it was for me haha). Probably will stick to the regular fries. \n\nBut all in all, it was a great experience. Service was attentive and food was yummy, and the pricing was pretty affordable. Didn't hurt my wallet too much aha. A go to spot in Vegas for sure!"

Boiling crab is really good too, but it's oilier compared to Hot N' Juicy. H&J's sauce is thick and goes perfectly with some steamed rice. Eat that ish with yo hands village style, straight from the table! cause it tastes better that way.\n\nI find myself craving H&J alllllllllll the time! \n\nThe reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because BC has their seasoned fries and catfish/shrimp basket on LOCK. if you've never had it, it's a must try over there.\n\nAlso, I've had a bad oyster here before, and had severe stomach pains... I didn't know it was bad because I've never had a bad oyster before, but when that excruciating pain kicked in, I knew it was that last oyster I had right away. It tasted really bad too, but I just swallowed it quickly as a natural impulse. (that's what she said!)\n\nI would still come back of course, I love hot n' juicy, but owners, if you're reading this, please make sure you train your staff well enough to differentiate bad oysters vs good ones. \n\nUntil next time H&J.. I will be dreaming about dat sawwwwwwse."

I mean, I am a true head-sucking, tail-eating fool!!!  Most crawfish I have eaten has been a crawfish boil at someone's house. \nThen some friends wanted to go to Hot and Juicy, and I definitely joined the party. \n\nService:  One of our friends at the table also worked here, so we were treated very well. Not really sure how the wait staff would be without our VIP. \n\nFood:  Ok, I'm probably not the best person to critique the food, because I'm a little biased of what good crawfish is. \nWe did order a whole bunch of seafood for the table, because they have many other things...we had crawfish, crab legs, muscles, shrimp, and clams.  \nI started out with the crawfish...of course...and was immediately thrown off with the heavy garlicky almost sweet flavor of the boil it was in. I tried all the other seafood, but just did not care for this flavor no matter what the host. \nThe friend that works here suggested I order the Louisiana style, so I jumped all over that.  I ordered the crawfish extra spicy too!  It was much better than the original flavoring, but still not like home. I guess I'm just a crawfish snob. \n\nOverall review:  I won't be back anytime soon.  I will save my crawfish cravings to be satisfied when I go home to Louisiana to see my kin folks."

Our waitress could have been more attentive to us but I can cut her a little bit of slack because she had around 5 other tables with full parties that she had to watch over.  \n\nSpecifically on the food, it seemed a bit over priced compared to other restaurants in town (Boiling Crab).  I personally didn't order any seafood as I just ordered a catfish basket and tried my friends' seafood, which had too much sauce in my opinion which was swimming at the bottom of the bag.\n\nAs far as the restaurant itself, it's odd to have it as an L-shaped restaurant as opposed to a more open area.  There were a few TV's tuned to sports but they weren't very loud.\n\nOverall, it won't be my go-to spot for Cajon food, but at least now I know."

So, I'm happy about not having to wait but Not so happy about the service and their crawfish that day. The service was slow and unfriendly and the crawfish was not fresh at all. It was small and very chewy. I know crawfish is not in season in February when i went but I thought they serve up fresh live crawfish year round. I didn't expect it to be less great (being the first one opening) than their place in Washington D.C where it never disappoint. Every chance I visit D.C, I always stop by to order or eat in. The flavor of their sauces there seems tastier, more flavorful, and crawfish fresher. If anyone has a chance to visit D.C and loves crawfish as much as I do, then stop by the Hot n Juicy there!"

We decided to try this place as our grand daughter was turning 7 and requested crab for her birthday dinner.  We didn't know what to expect but we were very pleasantly surprised.  The place was squeaky clean.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient.  The food? Amazing.  The birthday girl had a pound of crab legs and asked for more.  We each ate the pound of crab legs plus a pound of shrimp.  The sauces and seasonings were delicious.  The corn fritters were great.  Hubby, who is not a big seafood fan, will eat fried shrimp and these were great.  Our one regret was having show tickets and having to leave the restaurant when what we all really wanted to do was order another round of crab for everyone.  This is the new must-do when our son's family comes out to visit."

I remember a while back, my friend took me to the one on the west side on Spring Mountain and we had to park down the street and walk over.  As we were getting closer, there was a line of people waiting to get into the restaurant.  It was like waiting to get into the hottest club - but when I took a look into the restaurant, it was small and a whole bunch of people just eating crawfish, crab, and shrimp with their hands, plastic everywhere, and I was just not excited to wait and go on that ride so we decided to go elsewhere.  \n\nWell, a few years have passed - I am visiting Vegas and my friends tell me that they are celebrating a bday at this restaurant - and I think \"Oh no, not sure if I want to do that\", but I decided to not be a party pooper and go.  So we were a party of 20+ and the restaurant was a good space so I was happy about that.  There were napkins and plastic everywhere on our table and the table was covered in paper.  I was told to put on a bib and order the shrimp and crawfish.  \n\nI was scared.  In my eyes, if you are going out to eat and you are paying an establishment to cook your food for you, you should not be preparing to nip/tuck (getting ready to get into surgery).  So the food comes out and here comes a bag of shrimp and a bag of crawfish that they stick in front of my face.  I ask my friends (who are not amateurs at this restaurant), \"What now?  How the hell do I eat this?\" They tell me to stick the food on the table and peel the shrimp.  Ok, peel, peel, peel, then eat.  Then the crawfish.  How the hell do I eat a crawfish?  You break off its head and pull the tail to eat the meat, I was told. 3 minutes after crushing this crawfish like a ravenous eagle, I take its insides and put it in my mouth.  Then I think, \"All this work for less than a bite full of food?\"  Don't get me wrong - the flavor was good, but this is hard work.\n\nAfter I devoured my food, I was tired.  My hands hurt, I smelled like fish and shrimp, and I was ready to take a shower.  For the first time, I think it was a good experience, but the next time I plan to eat out, I will go to a restaurant that does all the work and I won't feel so dirty after eating."

They have a lot of high rated reviews by locals and it was something different from where we usually when in Vegas.   \n\nRestaurant~ This place is busy with loads of people wearing plastic bibs and gloves eating bags of garlic immersed cooked crustaceans.  It's very open with plenty of seating for small or large groups of peeps.  One of the first things you notice when you walk in is the BLAST of garlic odor.  I normally love the smell of garlic, but this was too intense for me.  \n\nService~ like a lot of places anymore! some of the people that work here are really friendly and seem very helpful and then there are a few that were not helpful at all and seem to treat us like number takers...  Maybe it's because they are so busy, but that's just an excuse.  I could care less man vs food dined here, which is what two of the servers told us and it's on their menu.  I'm looking for quality of taste and not quantity of food to conquer.  \n\nFood~ we had shrimp, clams and crawfish cooked in their juicy sauce which was very good but loads and loads of garlic...  \n\nThis is an A-OK place especially if you're planning to do take out!  I recommend going when the crawfish are in season, order to go and share the good eats with some friends."

SAUCES: please don't bother with getting anything under SPICEY.   the seafood just tastes bland otherwise.    EXTRA SPICEY will make you cry.\n2.  Wear clothes u don't care about so you don't have to wear those ridiculous looking bibs...  some people go as far as wearing hamburger helper gloves to eat.!   please save yourself the embarrassment of looking stupid.\n3.  i like to save whatever sauces is left over and pour them into one bag to go.   i know - it sounds YUCK...  but the sauce is great with everything you cook.   Omelletes (sp.?), over dry noodles with egg, etc."

Already big stars for this great space.\nNo kidding- I had to look at the ceiling because the tables were hotbeds of orange spice colored plastic gloves, worn by immaculately dressed women and men fishing into huge bags of colorful crawfish and shrimp. It was like a movie about starvation but you had to wear gloves. Little kids and parents were chowing down on the table's contents, happy as clams, no pun intended.\nMy husband had whispered \"Crawfish\" all the way here. I suggested he get the 2 pound bag of crawfish because there would be spiced corn and a potato in the bag to fill him up.\nMeanwhile I ordered the catfish basket with sweet potato fries and a Sapporo. Hot, delicious and non-messy.... \nBack to his side of our table-- the man with the hot spicy crawfish pulled tiny bits of fish from the shells and exclaimed that now he needed a meal to fill him up! We laughed! Seriously? This former auto body repairman who had his bleeding hands tied up with duct tape and bandages to finish a job says \"This was too much work.\"\nWe both want to come back for Dungeness crab, oysters and shrimp.\nGreat experience- good food and attentive, helpful staff.\nNext time if you come- take a shuttle or bus or even walk- the parking lot is scary as hell after 5.\nPs he walked not far away and honestly- he ate a crepe filled with strawberries and covered with whipped cream and chocolate.

I will say it's a hit or miss, great concept people love it but there's an art to steaming seafood in plastic bags with juices, they tend to keep cooking long after they've been removed from the steamer especially since they keep the bag tied.  When sitting in the back and when they bring it out to you.  That extra time cooking in its own juices tends to overcook the food, I ordered blue crab for 11.99 a pound that gets you 2 little crabs which is ridiculous they were totally mushy,snow crabs 18.99 a pound that gets you 1 cluster, I got a half pound shrimp which they serve with the heads on which makes them heavier they were borderline overcooked, I also paid $2 and change for a half dozen of sausages I received one sausage cut in 6 pieces lmfao the pieces were still attached. Meal cost me $51 for mushy food, it's not the first time I've experienced this but it most certainly will be the last."

Or maybe during off hours?\n\nCame here on a Saturday night around 5:30-it wasn't too terribly busy, but based on the amount of time it took someone to acknowledge our presence while we loitered by the register led me to believe other wise. The waitress who seated us ended up being our waitress for the evening and while she was nice, service was so slow-almost unbearably so.\n\nI ordered the garlic butter shrimp (mild) and my mom got the hot 'n juicy special crawfish (hot) Prices were great (we got lucky, I think at only 9.99/pound) and I took down almost all of the shrimp by myself. My mom really enjoyed her crawfish and she loves spicy, but I think she was really challenged to finish it. Half way through her nose was running and she wanted to dump the ice water on her face. \n\nMy mom polished off my last few shrimp because she was still hungry after her crawfish BUT she didn't take my advice and eat the rice with the leftover sauce in the bag, which I definitely recommend. That sauce! With the rice it was like having a nice little stew with great, concentrated flavor. Beware: there appears to be garlic in everything and my mom and I are still suffering the after effects. Seriously, invest in a tongue scraper and use it after brushing your teeth that night! There's THAT much garlic, but I loved it. \n\nThis place is meat and carb central and there is not one vegetable on the menu. No you guys, potatoes and corn don't count. I didn't mind that because I felt like I got my money's worth food wise, but wouldn't hold it against them if they added some steamed broccoli or something to the menu.\n\nAlso, it's very, very messy eating. So don't come here on a first date unless you a) don't mind eating like a caveman in front of someone else and b) don't mind someone else eating like a caveman in front of you. Ladies, bring a hair tie because there's nothing more distracting than tossing your hair out of your face every few minutes! I would even suggest wearing clothes that you may not care about because while they give you a generously large bib and gloves, there's no guarantee that some of those delicious sauces and juice won't go flying on your clothes in an eating frenzy. The attire is very casual though-so much so that I didn't feel bad about wearing pocketed sweatpants.\n\nI did think the lack of continuity in service did warrant knocking off two stars. I watched as people came in and were left unattended for extended periods of time and it was incredibly awkward. Seriously-hire a hostess for busy nights! By the time we left, the place was packed and there was a crowd of people hovering in the door way like vagrants-there was just no system!\n\nI would absolutely come back as I enjoyed the food but will not expect much in terms of service."

I found more dead crawfish in my two lb bag then fresh ones and the food was so disappointing that we didn't even finish our food.  We usually start with 2lbs and end with at least 4-5lbs each.  The new ratings are right food doesn't seem as fresh, poor service, and the flavors are different.  We need more consistency.  I didn't want to go to the new place because you take that chance it's not the same different cooks and I lost my appetite for hot n juicy for this 4day vacay.

I use them to soak up the delicious sauce.  Make sure to get corn, too- so good!\nSomeone in our party got the crab and didn't care for it.  The crawfish is pretty good, but I still go for the shrimp.  Looking forward to coming back!"

I really like Hot N Juicy because all of their restaurants are SO CONSISTENT. East to West everything is well managed and the food is always AMAZING!\n\nI love the sauce at Hot N Juicy, it is definately in the Top 3 in my crawfish eating adventures. I love the ratio of sour, cajun and just heavenly goodness. You can never go with the crawfish here, they are fresh, good sized and perfectly cooked! If anything is off, just let your server know and they'll take care of it. \n\nLove their baskets as well, catfish is plentiful.. and kind of tastes like cod in my opinion... weird... I was expecting fishy! It's ok cod is good too. The fries they have are better than Boiling Crab because they are more starchy and taste more real! Love dunking fries in Ranch sauce. I'm not much of a fan of Gulf Oysters, but my company sure loved them, they were really plump and a nice medium size. Oh and Hot N Juicy is the ONLY crawfish place that has\n\nThe place is really messy though, that's my one complaint, I know they're busy but still at least wipe down and sweep a little. We were literally sitting on oil and crawfish shells it was a bit weird... Service is awesome, everyone who works at Hot N Juicy is so upbeat and chill. Food is fast and communication between FOH and BOH is instant since they have good In-N-Out like headsets (it's pretty funny). This location is pretty big so big parties would fit, the ambiance is cozy and nice (not as trashy as BC)."

Perfect for making sure all them there crawfish are evenly covered in the most amazingly delicious sauce you could ever want.

Crawfish fall firmly under this heading ergo...\n\nWent in on a Saturday night and the place was half full, but filling up fast. Got a great table with enough room so we could peel some crawfish and drink some beer. The place is clean and nice and has a family feel to it, namely because of the large tables for groups. \n\nSat down and immediately ordered crawfish, oysters, mussels and dungeness crab. We also ordered some beer. Their selection is small and disappointing, but if you like domestics and Sapporo you should be okay. \n\nVery quickly out come bags of crawfish. They were tiny, but that was sort of okay because I knew that they were out of season. Still you're really paying for a lot of body and very little meat this time of year.\n\nI ordered mine very spicy, you can choose how you want them seasoned. I wanted them to burn, which they did. The friend I was with got his mild and they were okay. I'm a huge fan of hot, so. We also got the mussels which were my very, very favorite. I could have just eaten them. They had this nice, garlic-y sauce and were tender and tasty! The oysters weren't tops shelf, I probably would never get them from here again, but put a little cocktail sauce on them and they're edible. Also ordered the dungeness crab. WASTE. DO NOT BUY. It was probably the worst waste of $30 I've ever spent and just thinking about it upsets me. You get a huge crab with big legs and you crack it open and the meat is mealy. You don't pull it out in big, chunky pieces, it actually can be gotten out with a spoon. If the company I had been with wasn't so awesome I would have pitched a FIT. Gross.\n\nThe service here is pretty sporadic. One minute they're fawning over you, next twenty minutes you're asking where the beer is you've asked for five times. \n\nI probably won't ever go back here, but it was nice to see what the (over) hype was about.\n\nEdited to add: If you're expecting Louisiana crawfish you will be disappointed, this tastes nothing like it. It's their own made up something that is decent, but NOT cajun. Also, they give you gloves if you don't want  your hands to smell fishy for three days - that was a nice touch."

The hostess was super cheerful and friendly and gave us bibs and a fresh roll of paper towels as she sat us. Our server came shortly after and asked for our drink orders and asked if we had ever been there before and we said no so they could explain how it works to my friend. Our server was very thorough she took the time to explain the different shellfish and the different seasonings. We decided on 1lb of shrimp each with the hot n juicy seasoning but hers extra spicy and mine just mild. I like spicy things but that mild gets my nose running! We also ordered corn sauasage and potato in our bags. And we got an order of cajun fries. Our fries came out within 8 minutes they were hot and golden and had a little kick to them...they were just perfect. 5 minutes later our shrimp came and we dug right in. Deeeeeelicious!

When we got there there was 2 parties in front of us but the worker at the front was in a really bad mood. We got seated after about 5 minutes. Server asked us what we wanted to drink about 10 minutes after being seated. He came back, took our order, and the food took about another 10-15 mins. Which wasn't bad. \nHowever, 1) we never got bibs 2) we never got cutters for the crab, we had to ask a different server for it 3) our server didn't check up on us till we were just about done eating. \nThe food was okay. I should have gotten Baby Spice instead of Mild because it was hotter than I expected. Our stomachs were really upset after eating. I also noticed another person sitting near us who complained about her stomach being sore as well. \nI would go back to Hot N Juicy Crawfish but maybe I'll try out the other location instead. I'm rating it 3/5 stars because the customer service was terrible."

Fast forward to the food I ordered a 1 pound of snow crab legs and my friend ordered 1 pound of shrimp and we both shared the Cajun fries. \nThe fries were great with a nice kick to it. We ordered or seafood with the hot n juicy sauce (all 3 flavors) it was awesome! Tried a few other places and this probably would be up there with the top 3, EXCEPT the service! It was awful. \nI honestly don't even know who our waiter was. I asked for something to crack open the legs, I didn't receive it until I had two legs left and no energy to attempt the remaining ones. We had to repeat ourselves several times to multiple waiters just to get something. It was very frustrating.

Shrimp... then crab.... some fried catfish.... then a sudden halt. Where's the crawfish? Asked a waitress to check on it after waiting at least 15 minutes. She said \"they're working on it, it should be right out.\" 10 minutes later, still nothing. Ask another server - \"it's on the ticket so it should be on the way.\" ANOTHER 15 minutes and at this point we don't even want it anymore. I mean seriously, it took us less time to wait to order and eat everything, and still no crawfish. We ask if we can cancel the order since it's taken WAY too long. Great no problem... then the bill comes and they still charge for the crawfish! Ayuh! Wave one down again and they take it off - no apology... nothing.\n\nAs far as the taste - it's not all that. If ya'll are from So. Cal, don't waste your time here. Go to Boiling Crab in L.A.  Save your time and money for the craps table - at least you'll have a fighting chance.

No plates.  No spoons.  Paper cups. Food served in plastic bags served on a plastic table cloth.  No utensils were offered at all.  I had a few pounds of HotNJuicy crayfish that tasted pretty good, but were swimming in enough garlic to choke a small country.  Not that there's anything wrong with garlic.   Back to the utensils.  OK I get it.  Crayfish is something you eat with our fingers, but I'm supposed to eat boiled potatoes with my fingers?  That's too much to ask.   I'd also like to get offered the option of some sort of condiment with the crayfish.  Some cocktail sauce or melted butter would have been really nice, but despite having at least 6 waitresses in the place they barely spoke to us at all.  They just kept walking past us over and over helping other tables.  It was seriously incompetent wait service.  The person who took our order never really came back to ask us if we needed anything at all and we had to waive down somebody to bring a check and then we waited at least 10 minutes for change.  \n\nThe highlight of the meal was the soft shell crab basket.  The fries were perfectly cooked and the crab was plentiful and tasty.  Well done and a descent deal at around $11.  The $11 per pound price on the crayfish was high considering that there was not really a ton of food in a whole bag full.   At the end of the meal I started noticing everyone else had a bowl of lemons and what looked like a finger bowl.  We never got and because nobody was paying any attention to us at all it was a problem,  This is really messy stuff to eat.  Your fingers get caked up with garlic and spices and paper towels simply do not handle it.  When we asked for something to wash out hands we were instructed to go to the restroom - which was actually quite nasty inside.  Dark.  Dirty.  Pretty gross actually.  All I needed was a descent wet wipe like the kind most restaurants that serve messy food offer you.  Better than that would have been a finger bowl of lemon water.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to sell people food at $20-$40  per person the least you can do is offer them a wet wipe."

Make sure to order sausage slices too because those are amazing in the bag with the seafood!\n\nDon't wear anything too nice and don't plan on going anywhere where people will judge you on your guaranteed garlic scent!

I have preached the wonders of shrimp and crawfish to all my friends and will even choose H&J over The BoilingCrab. I have had many wonderful dinners at the original location and the servers are always so attentive. So why the low rating for this new location you ask? Its not the food that lacks at this location, it's the service. \n\nWe tried out this place on a Thursday night around 9:00.. It wasn't too busy so when we arrived the hostess sat us right after she cleared up a booth. After a while a not so enthusiastic nor friendly server took our drink order. Then when she came back we ordered 2 lbs of shrimp + potatoes, rice, rolls and sweet potato fries. \n\nSlowly our order started to arrive one by one delivered by a food runner.. Soon we received everything except the sweet potato fries. Over half way through our dinner still no fries.. And no sign of our server.. So we have to flag someone down & ask and we find out that they ran out of SP fries a while a go and our server was supposed to tell us.. Then we are told not to worry it will immediately be taken off our check..\n\nAt this point our server has yet to once check up on us.. I spot her bottle blonde pig tails numerous times chit chatting with her co workers and horsing around.. \n\nThen we have to flag someone down again to place a Togo order but then we're told the kitchen is closed...  \n\nFinally our server shows up only to plop a\ncheckbook down on the table.. Peeved, we want to leave so we give her our card., when it comes back we realize they didn't take off the fries after all.. So we go to the front and the girl apologizes and says she needs to swipe the card again but we should be rest assured it will only be charged once because they settle all the transactions at the end of the night. So there goes another 5 minutes of waiting around due to bad service all the while food is still being brought out to tables.. \"kitchen closed\" my a$$.. \n\n..The next day sure enough the card got charged twice from hot and juicy. \n\nNow I'm sorry, I honestly don't mean to be rude and I am a pretty patient person but seriously how hard is it to be a server at a restaurant that only has plastic silverware, paper towels and serves their food from a plastic bag.. ?

We had to wave another person for another beer. No one checked back with us or anything. Our check was $130 for 3 people. We left $20 for the service that we didn't get. Let's just say not for awhile, but I will just wait in line to the original location."

Our food took forever to come out and it was not very good. My friend and I ordered 1 dozen oysters, 1lb crawfish, 1lb clams, 1lb shrimp, fish n chips, and 1lb snow crabs. Nothing was fresh or good except the clams and fish. The crab was $15 a lb and tasted so bland and not fresh. The dozen of oysters was also horrible. Worst oysters I've ever ate and also not fresh. My most expensive dishes were both horrible. Our bill for just 2 was $90 including tip. But not only did our food taste like crap, our waitress was very rude that she pushed us off to another waitress. The next day my whole party of 10 all had stomaches and the bathroom was our best friend. It completely ruined my Vegas trip, yet alone the car ride home and it lasted for 2/3 days. Never again hot n juicy..."

The hubby loves seafood and I'm not much of a fan but this place definitely made me think differently.\n\nWe had lunch here since it was less busy than dinner time and were so glad we had a chance to try out the food.  Everything is pretty much steamed and then tossed in thick clear plastic bags to absorb whatever sauces you choose.  They also give you gloves and bibs because it does get messy, but that is where everything tastes so much better.\n\nWe ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell, 2 lbs of Dungeness crab, 2 lbs of frozen  crawdads (they didn't have any fresh ones flown in that day), and 1 lb of shrimp.  We had them all tossed in the famous Hot n Juicy sauce (which is a combination of all their flavors they have) with a spice level of Spicy.  Man, it had major kick and made all the seafood taste so much better.  The hubby was surprised to see me for the very first time actually sucking on all the sauce juices from the seafood, normally I just peel away and eat the meat.\n\nIt is definitely two things that make this place well known:  the freshness and simplicity of their seafood choices, and the killer sauces everything is tossed in.  Staff were all very friendly (especially our waitress Polina) , always stopping in to make sure everything was okay.  Definitely recommend this place if you are a seafood fan.  We will return next time we are in Vegas."

Sometimes, if the quality of the food is high and the uniqueness of the selections are compelling, the fact that you are sitting at a picnic table with a disposable tablecloth (and no plates BTW) doesn't factor into the equation.  In a town like Vegas where everything on the strip now costs an arm and a leg (or two), finding this alternative fine dining establishment just a $10 cab ride away was a pleasure.\n\nHot N Juicy Crawfish is a picnic table throw your food on the table type place that serves seafood by the pound.  Mussels, clams, shrimp, crab, and - of course - crawfish.  Just good quality ingredients, professionally steamed with your choice of toppings.  You can also add in some corn on the cob, potatoes and other sides just to fill out your plate.  My party tried a mix of the food with their spicy topping.  \n\nThey have four tiers of spice and we chose the second to the top.  Be forewarned that the spice - while fantastically good - will bite you.  I fancy myself a spice aficienado that can handle more than most.  At first bite, the spicy didn't seem that hot.  Over time (like in the next 10 minutes), i had sweat pouring off my brow.  I felt like Nixon at a presidential debate.  If I had to do it again, woulda chose the medium just so i wouldn't have to immediately head to the hotel and take a shower.\n\nIf you, like me, at some point just guest bored of the strip and need a change - Hot N Juicy is a good find just a short drive away.  There are multiple locations in Vegas - this one in particular is located in the Chinatown area."

The interior was open and modern. Service was a bit slow, and at times, left us fending for ourselves in pursuit of bibs and gloves.\n\nAs for food, we ordered a pound of the Hot N Juicy special, spicy crawfish with sausage, two pounds of the HnJ special, extra spicy shrimp - both with corn and potatoes - as well as some fried shrimp. The seafood were around $11, fluctuating according to market price. Corn was .75 cents, potatoes .60, and sausage 2.75 for half a dozen. For the four of us, we were shed blood, sweat, and tears from the meal (perhaps not the first, but you get the picture). When they say Extra Spicy, they mean it. But the crawfish was good as a commodity (necessary for a first time). The shrimp though? That's where it's at. Succulent, packed with flavor - those babies were my favorite. As for its fried counterpart, the cornmeal breading was a bit overbearing and fully encompassing. It didn't stop us from devouring it as refuge from the spiciness of Extra Spicy. For about 60 dollars, this was more than enough among the four of us.\n\nI love the idea around HnJ - communal and casual eats. Good food around people who love you despite your barbaric eating habits. As for the technicalities of a restaurant, service could be better. But I don't expect much from a place with plastic tablecloths."

Thats 1 hour and 14 minutes of sitting at a table waiting for a simple order. We came as a party of two; we're regulars so, whenever we come here we order as soon as we sit down because we are familiar with the long wait times. We know what we like and get the same order every time, we love the restaurant and always bring in our family and friends, and this is the first time we have ever come down and had to wait so long for anything. \n\nOur simple order was for 1 lb of Shrimp HnJ Special (Spicy), 1 lb of Shrimp HnJ Special (Mild), and two sides of rice.\n \nAfter the many times we have come we know that ordering clams / oysters takes about 25 min, ordering wings or fried cod can take from 30min-40min, but cajun/regular fries and shrimp are usually under 20 min. Yes i acknowledge that it was busy, it was the lunch rush when we came, and you did have 2 parties of at least 8 people maybe more, but still 74 minutes is a long time to wait from ORDERING to RECEIVING the food.\n\nAfter 45 minutes we asked a waitress to check on our order, she left and came back and said, \"Your order is coming, when you got here the kitchen was behind at least 20 orders, ok? so its not as if we forgot about you.\" Heres a tip, customers aren't as interested in hearing an excuse of whats taking so long, as what you are/will be doing to remedy the situation, also note that a simple apology or showing that its unacceptable to wait so long goes a long way. No one was apologetic or sincere until the end of our meal, when someone dropped off the check and said, \"Here you are, and I'm sorry for the wait.\" The end of the meal is too late for the apology, it should happen in real time.\n\nI was here twice last December and completed a survey each time, each visit the store wasnt busy, no wait time on a table and the friendliness was outstanding, straight 5s across the board. I hope your standards arent slipping, and your service isnt failing, i would hate for an tasty restaurant to suffer from bad/neglected service."

Maybe this place will change my opinion? \n\nWe arrived on a Thursday night and this place was packed! Apparently, there are two locations. I don't know if the service/food differs, but we decided to wait for a seat. Within 15 minutes, we were seated, which isn't too bad. We ordered three different flavors of crawfish - two pounds of cajun, one pound of hot n juicy, and one pound of the lemon and pepper. The first two flavors were not bad, the third we could've done without. The crawfish were juicy, fresh, and flavorful.. not bad, not bad! Each one pound order of crawfish comes with a side of corn on the cob, yum. If you order two pounds, you get corn on the cob and potatoes! \n\nAside from crawfish, we also had an order of garlic butter clams. They were ok, could've done without as well. The weird garlic that was used had a strong kick to it which reminded me of straight up horse radish.\n\nAll in all, the food was not bad for someone who isn't a fan of crawfish. Top it off with some blue moon, and you'll be set! \n\nI do have to admit one thing, though... I felt like I was in a club when I was dining in there. They had some club trance music going on, which made me feel as if I had to peel the crawfish to the beat lol. It was interesting...."

Since moving away in 1998, I have been searching for some decent Cajun food, and an authentic crawfish boil is no exception. So on my most recent trip to Vegas, I knew I had to stop by Hot N Juicy Crawfish. The name alone warrants a visit to the place! Right when we landed, we headed to HNJC, we didn't even check into our hotel! The wait was a brief 20 minutes. I ordered 2 pounds of crawfish in the special sauce-- medium spicy (I think it was a level 8 of 10). I thought I could handle it. After all, I am Asian and from New Orleans- a lethal combo, duh! In 10 minutes, my crawfish arrived hot and steaming in my own personal bag. I burned my fingers trying to peel the first couple of crawfish, but I could not wait. The garlic juices were running down my fingers-- thank goodness for my bib. The size was smaller than what I am used to seeing, but the Cajun flavor I was craving was present and the spice was just perfect. ok, I couldn't take it. It was sooooo hot! But honey badger don't care. I kept burning my fingers, burning my mouth, and eventually, burning my stomach. Will I go again? Hell yeah."

Their spice is not for the faint of heart! Even their mild spice has a good amount of kick. So far I've tried their shrimp, crawfish, corn fritters, and fries. You have to peel the shrimp and crawfish yourself.  It's a bit of a hassle, but it's part of the experience.\n\nDon't waste your time or money on the crawfish.  Big creature, small amount of meat.  1 lb of shrimp in Hot N Juicy seasoning is the way to go.  \nKeep in mind that when you order by the pound, that includes the weight of the entire shrimp body, antennas, legs, and the juice. Their seasoned fries are burn-your-face-off spicy, and with all the spice in the shrimp, I found it overwhelming. Their corn fritters are crispy, creamy, sweet balls of corny goodness.  They pair perfectly with the spicy shrimp.\n\nFor those who have children or unenthusiastic seafood eaters in your group, they also offer things like chicken strips and popcorn shrimp on their menu.\n\nOh and unless you want your fingers to burn for hours after the meal and garlic scented fingertips for the next week, WEAR THE GLOVES!"

The wait to be seated was a bit much since it is a tiny restaurant, the waitress who seated us seemed bothered. However, our original waitress was on point and very friendly. The seafood in the bag all tasted the same no matter what you ordered. It was ok, but I bet I could find better."

Since we were already here, we might as well try it. This was my parents' first time trying this spot so I wanted them to have a great time. \n\nThe spot was definitely more spacious than the original, which was good. Our greeter was very accommodating and sat as relatively quickly. Unfortunately, our server ended up being this tattooed chick, Cam. Bad luck. Right off the bat, she was not very friendly and seemed to rush us. Since it was my parents' first time, I wanted them to take their time to inspect the menu. I ended up ordering for all of us. She was rushing like she had somewhere else to go, even though the place wasn't too packed. The wait was not very long but things were missing. I constantly had to ask for things like crab crackers, missing orders, and she probably only refilled our drinks once. Our waitress was more concerned about hugging her friends that came in than doing her job. I had to ask servers from other tables for refills, additional orders, etc because when we wanted anything, Cam was nowhere to be found. \n\nBy the time we finished eating we were still missing rice and another order. I decided to cancel those because who knows when I would get them. I don't usually appreciate bad service, but I'm especially concerned when I'm trying to introduce my parents to a new place on their anniversary. The food was good but the service we received from Cam that day was horrible! Because of this, I will stick to going only to the original spot from now on. If my parents didn't enjoy the food I would've taken it down 2 more stars.\n\nHot n Juice = good\nCam = horrible"

Whenever anyone mentions seafood in a bag in the back of my head I'm rolling my eyes thinking \"Psh, this is gonna taste like shit compared to Boiling/Kickin Crab.\" Okay I was wrong. The seafood was fresh and the flavor of the Hot N Juicy sauce was fiiiire (bomb AND super spicy). I got spicy because I usually get spicy at boiling/kickin and it was a bit much so I recommend getting medium. The fries were definitely not the business.... And the corn was a bit soggy...

They provide you with bibs, plenty of paper towels, and wet naps because you will be splashing sauce everywhere and using a lot of your hands.\n\nI recommend the shrimp and lobster. Of course the lobster is the most expensive; however, once in a while it's SOOO worth the money. The clams are fantastic as well. My regular order is a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab legs EXTRA EXTRA spicy with 2 corn on the cob, a bowl of rice, and occasionally the order of lobster but that's rare because I don't want to spend a fortune every time I'm there $$$. The Hot n Juicy special sauce is by far my favorite, but the cajun is fantastic as well. I usually do one of each. They also have fresh oysters for appetizers, and you can also choose from blue crab, king crab, mussels, and of course, crawfish for your main course ;). \n\nThe service is always great because the staff works as a team, so there is almost always somebody to refill your water, grab you more plastic gloves, etc.. \n\n\n**HERE'S AN IMPORTANT TIP!**: you WILL stink of garlic after this meal. Possibly for over a day! The food is worth it, but don't go here before your work shift, the gym, or a night out with friends because nobody will appreciate your stench! A thorough shower afterwards is crucial!\n\nOverall, I love visiting Hot N Juicy for the fun environment, quick and attentive service, the killer spicy cajun flavors, and to get full off of a ton of seafood! As much as I enjoy Boiling Crab, HnJ is still on top mostly because of their sauces. HnJ has more of a kick and intense flavors."

That was delicious! 1 pound shrimp, 1 pound crawfish and 1 pound blue crab later licking my fingers with burning lips ends off a good dinner. I love the lemon pepper sauce! We ordered two sides of corn and my corn was soaked in the lemon pepper sauce until the end of the meal finishing it like it wa my dessert :) I usually do not like spicy food but here I got with a medium for a kick. Which to me is spicy but probably to others is not spicy at all! I go and eat at Hot n Juicy every time I am in town. I wish they had one in Salt Lake! I probably would go everyday. lol. We did have to wait about half hour on a Friday night. All the servers help each other out which you don't see often at restaurants. They work as a team and that is amazing.

I read reviews of both places and after much research, careful review and taste, Hot n Juicy takes the cake...hands down!\n\nThe service here is awesome! I came in and put my name in to be seated. The lady told me how long the wait was, which was not that long, and I sat down and observed the others delve into their bags. Then when the time came for my friend and I to be seated, our waitress was right there ready to take our order. I asked some questions and she had answers to all of them. She was super nice and told me her honest opinion of some of the food. I decided to get what I got at BC to make a fair decision, so I ordered two pounds of the snow crab legs. One lb in medium and 1 lb in mild. My friend ordered 2 lb of crawfish in medium as well. And off she went to put our order. \n\nFrom the tome we put or order in, to the time our food was in front of me was probably around ten min. At BC it was linger and I had to check to make sure my order was still on the way. My friends food came out first. Luckily, she waited for mine to come out and then we began stuffing our faces. Holy goodness and juiciness! At BC, I had to fight to get to the meat and it wasn't as sweet or juicy, but not here. The crab legs were tender, sweet, juicy and hot! I had to slow myself down and savor the moment. I didn't want it to end. I also ordered corn, which was marinating in the sauce. So tasty!  The corn itself was boiled to perfection, then sitting in the sauce was even better! Medium is hot if you dip the meat in it like I did. The waterworks began because it was a bit hot, but good. I dipped the legs in the medium then mild after a few. I ate some of the crawfish too and that was really juicy as well. Some of them were a bit small, but still yummy. Our lady checked in with us a few times and each time I had no words, but nods because I was so into my food, and my mouth was full. I was already eating with my hands, to speak with food in my mouth would be throwing manners completely out the window.  By the end of our meal, I was ready to pass out. All worth smelling like garlic for the rest of the night and into the next day. \n\nThe place has an open layout. They have booths, tables and chairs. Flat screen tv's hang on the walls and they also play music. The noise level is pretty high, but that's to be expected. \n\nI will be back here! Some may not like it because you eat with your hands and all the sauce and juice is just popping and flying. But they do offer gloves and a bib. So not to worry. This type of stuff you miss when you're not there. How can you beat the service, juicy food and hip atmosphere? Well, you don't."

You can order a half lb of shrimp which is like the perfect size. \n\nAlso if you are on a low sodium diet then look elsewhere.\n\nI always get the same thing. Lemon pepper shrimp that is mild with some sausage steamed that gets cooked with it. Then I get a side of white rice.\n\nIf I'm feeling feisty then I get a potato.\n\nIf I'm with a group then I share some corn fritters.

Our server was amazed!  Soaked the rest of the catfish nuggets with the Hell Blazing crawfish juice to finish it off.  Despite the 3 blisters on my lip I obtained from my meal this place is amazing.

I just want to say customer service at this location is HORRIBLE! I went to the other location and they told me this one will have no wait so I came here. I waited 30 min for a seat. As I entered the two girls in the front did not greet me once. Didn't even say hi. As i approached to give them my name they said one min twice to me. I patienly wait. Three couple came in AFTER me and they were ALL seated first. I was so furious I kept my mouth shut so I wouldn't make a scene in front of my girlfriend. Luckily the food is great but service is absolutely horrible"

I had the shrimp with the medium hot n juicy marinade they got.. let me say that medium had a real good kick to it. I also ordered the soft shell crab basket and it comes with fries deep fried soft shell crab and it also is really great. But the softshell crab basket is not that big at all..  People need to try this place for sure.. I would give it the full 5 stars it deserves but its jus a lil pricy like I said in the begining with 1lb of shrimp. The soft shell crab basket and 2 drinks it came out to $30.. we left there hungry because its very little for wat you get. But definitely worth chrcking it out"

I've tried the frozen AND the fresh and it just seems like a waste...  I do prefer this place over Boiling Crab! We usually get snow crab legs, shrimp and oysters on the half shell. Our go to sauce is the Hot N Juicy Medium. Nice and spicy and flavorful. They offer you gloves for your hands but they are the big loose ones so I just opt out of those - they have a roll of paper towels on your table so you're pretty good with using those and then a quick trip to the bathroom to wash it all off. One of the sinks you have to keep pressing for water which is quite annoying because your hands are pretty messy afterwards so if they have two sinks that just stayed ON, it would be much better! \nYou do have a garlic taste in your mouth for at least a day after eating here but that's the price you pay for buttery garlicy goodness!

Upon opening the door though, one gets a huge waft of what's to come inside. The air just permeated of spicy, garlicky goodness. I tell you, it smelled SO good.\nA bit of disclaimer on this review: I'm not too big on most seafoods so take it with a grain of salt, for sure.  I realize it might sound odd then, that I would want to go to such a place. But hey, I love good friends and good food. And both at the same time? Fuhgedaboudit! And besides, theres still plenty I can find to partake of on the menu.\nBy reading some of the Yelp reviews previously, it seemed the thing to make a nice mess of what's left at the end of one's meal. You are prepared for the upcoming melee with stylish HnJ logo plastic bibs and tools to dismantle shells. We were also warned that their sauces were very hot, so it was suggested to order one level lower than what you think you want.\nMy friends got a mix of HnJ shrimp, crab legs, clams and crawfish. I opted for some etoufee, sweet potato fries and fried catfish basket with cajun fries. I also asked for some HnJ special medium sauce on the side so I could drench everything in it. My friend said all their food was great. I loved the HnJ special sauce. Probably could've gone to Hot, but the medium had a nice kick with savory garlic-ness. I was using a spoon to scoop the sauce from the bottom to make sure I got all the garlic bits and spices that settle to the bottom. I did have a feeling there was no cajun seasoning on the fries. No big deal, I just used the side sauce. Overall service and food was right on."

We had the corn fritters, pound of lemon garlic shrimp, pound of hot'n'juicy crawfish, a pound of Louisiana mussels and a pound of snow crab legs.\nThe corn fritters were fresh, juicy and just melted in your mouth. The shrimp was succulent and simply out of the world. The crawfish had a good flavor but they were not the best I've had. The waitress told us that they were out if fresh crawfish and only had them frozen and we got half price. The snow crab was meaty and was slightly on the saltier side. \nFor the portions and the price, this place is well worth it. There is a gelato bar 2 doors down and if you feel the burn, have the watermelon gelato."

I said, alright, if they place is so good, I'll take both of you there for lunch and it's my treat! Little did I know that this may be the most over priced restaurant in Las Vegas... And that's a fiercely competitive category.  First of all, if you're not into eating your overpriced Cajun style food from the same plastic bag it was cooked in, then you won't like this place. \n\nNow, pleeeeeze don't get me wrong, all the food we ordered TASTED GREAT!!! Big time... Although I recommend either be Mild or Medium spiciness levels, since the mild is hotter than most restaurant's Medium. My crab legs were delicious although a pound of them yields about 2 ounces of actual crab meat. The sausage was fast and the only item not so grossly overpriced. The corn was just OK, and the beverages were not up to the standards of an average Wendy's. For three of us, with only a single beer, an iced tea and an Arnold Palmer for beverages, the total for three of us with tip came to $118.00 and was $97.22 before gratuity. \n\nI am not a cheap diner, for example, I don't think twice about the cost of a Morton's or THE golden Steer or even the Fagao Do Chao Brazilian restaurant in Las Vegas... But, they at least provide cutlery, silverware, genuine plates, cups, glasses, great service and keep your table fairly clean. Hot N Juicy brings your meal out in a plastic bag, warns you to put their chintzy and inadequate bib on to protect your clothing and wishes you the best of luck with only a seafood shell cracker and a plastic poker to dig the meat out of your food. Their napkins are not up to the task and look like the stuff used by high school cafeterias... Despite rudimentary service, a lack of utensils, throw away beverage containers and the overwhelming presence of enough plastic to cause a petrochemical shortage... And undersized portions... The food was as tasty as I was told... But no better prepared or quality than many other restaurants that provide dinnerware, utensils, cloth napkins, bibs that are OK for those bigger than a toddler and much better service.  \n\nMy three star rating is justified by the excellent flavor and preparation, as well as fast service as they rush you to get out so they can turn the table and make more money... I envy the owner of this place because with a 15% food cost and no dish washing expenses, the menu prices must make this business a Hot N Juicy Cash Cow!"

This location is cute with brick walls and booths, as well as tables that aren't squished together.  There are a number of flat screens along the walls but I honestly didn't even notice them.  We got a booth right away and our server was great.  She brought our waters, answered all our questions, and took our orders and it was all seamless.  \n\nWe ordered a pound of shrimp, clams, 1/2 dozen sausage, 2 corns and some potatoes.  Everything came out within 15 minutes.  We were really impressed by the size of both the shrimp and the clams.  The clams were nice and plump and cooked perfectly.  They weren't rubbery at all, quite the opposite.  Also, the shrimp were cooked perfectly as well, which I was really happy about because both the last times I went to Boiling Crab, the shrimp were over cooked and tough.\n\nI also found myself loving the HNJ sauce more than the \"Whole Shebang\" at BC.  It was much more flavorful and not as thick so it coated all the seafood evenly.  Everything was served really hot so you never felt like you were eating cold seafood.\n\nOur server constantly refilled our waters and was really friendly. After being a BC fan for this long, I'm totally switching teams.  Team HNJ all the way!"

It was ok for kids, but probably a better place for adults. \n\nOverall, very great place to spend Father's Day with my family and our friends and their kids.

The crawfish is worth the try, even if you think you don't like it. Try a pound (~$12). If ordered when they are in peak season, they are huge and succulent. If you are hesitant, order the shrimp (but alas, they are also head-on.)\n\nGreat spot to take visitors, but be careful. During peak mealtimes the wait is horrendous. Take-out is a good option.

An outdoor eating area would be great or at least a sitting area. There is no indoor standing area, or paging system. Most people stand outfront in large groups or have to wait in the car. Also parking is a big pain in the *ss, so be sure you aren't running late for your date, it may take you a bit time to find a spot on a different local street."

I love a little spice to my food, but not too much where my nose is running. With that said, I get the shrimp with the Hot n' Juicy season mild. No surprise here that I have to order a side of cajun fries. I feel like you can't go to these types of restaurant and NOT order a side of cajun fries.\n\nThe only difference with the sauce is that this one seems a tad bit sweeter than Boiling Crab. I'm still a lover either way =) This place also has a bigger selection on beer.\n\nSo if you're into cajun food, but want to drink tons of beer as well - this place takes it over Boiling Crab. Although both places are good and you can't go wrong with either."

Then this morning I called to ensure we had an area for 20 and that we'd be there at 630pm. Whoever I spoke to said \"got it\".\nSo here's my complaint. \nI get here late because the parking area sucks. It's not their fault but the area where they're located is pretty popular.\nNext, as I walk into the restaurant the whole party is standing. Uhmmmm, why? Well because they don't take reservations. OH REALLY? So why did I call and make sure the reservation was set and you tell me it's all good?\nERIC, DO NOT tell me who I spoke to because you clearly spoke out of your ass. I'm frustrated because how are we supposed to plan an event like this and your WHOLE STAFF failed to communicate to us that your facility does not do reservations. Not only did you set back our plans for the night but you looked like an idiot when you told me who I spoke to with your sass. \nNext, \"the party of 20 has to sit 10 and 10 otherwise the wait is going to be longer\"\nWHY IN BABY JESUS WOULD I WANT MY PARTY TO SIT SEPARATELY? \nI have a bad attitude as it is and he added to the fuel. \n Eventually we sit down, everything went smooth after that. I wish I caught the name of our waiter because he was awesome and actually put me in a better mood. \nI'm only giving one star because the staff failed to accommodate the needs of our party, the host was rude which put me in a bad mood and I personally like another restaurant that is extremely similar to this restaurant where people are more friendly."

Be careful, Hot will get your sinuses running and that's only a level 3 (out of 4)- Trust me, I like my food spicy! Medium also has a kick to it.\n\nI love that sauce, so much that I will usually order fries to use to soak up the excess. Corn is also delish slathered in that sauce. I also always ask for lemon, salt, pepper- must be an Asian thing.\n\nCrawdaddies don't really fill me up so I will usually order some shrimp as well. They don't really seem to absorb the sauce as well though...\n\nEverything served here is finger food and very casual. I caved in and started wearing the plastic bibs offered- can't risk staining my clothes. It's bad enough that the smell of garlic permeated anything that enters the premise.

Nothing special about it, I just love fries! The snow crabs were very wet, just the way we like it. We asked for a side of butter but I think the waitress got confused and added butter to our flavoring I believe. But we ended up not needing the butter anyways because I ended up dipping in the bag. \nThe lobster, omg the lobster had so much meat. It was soooo good! Nothing compared to GA's seafood restaurants AT ALL. The oysters were very fresh and a pretty decent size. Pretty sure they were blue point oysters. Lastly, the crawfish. The flavor was there and all but for being live, it wasn't as big as a I hoped and it also kept breaking. \nAll and all I give this place a 4 stars for their amazing food!"

To my surprise, this location was not very packed on a Sunday afternoon, and there was plenty of seating, even for our group of 12.\n\nThe best bang for your buck at places like this is shrimp. When you get crawfish, you're throwing half of your money away because you can only eat the tail. Not worth it. I got a pound of Hot N Juicy Special Shrimp, Medium Spicy with a side of corn. The shrimp here are a hefty size (I'd say size 16/20) and the sauce is outstanding. I tend to stay away from spicy food, but even Medium was just the right level. If you get mild, the spice is nonexistent. A good combination of flavors that matches the shrimp well. \n\nThe employees are all very friendly and highly efficient. Our orders came out within 10 min and water was constantly refilled. Our waitress, Loreal (Never heard that name before, but that's what my friend said was on her name tag), did a fantastic job with our large group, and managed to throw in a few jokes here and there. It's hard to find real down to earth wait staff these days, but she's an exception. \n\nOverall, I was left stuffed, barely able to walk, and very satisfied.

I was craving some crawfish and finding good crawfish up here hasn't been easy lately.  So, I got in the new ride, picked up my companion, plugged in the iPod, and just hit the road. What a way to spend a Saturday.  \n\nOMG!!  Ultimately, although I wanted to eat more, I refrained from pigging out.  I stopped eating after I ate three pounds of crawfish...and yes I'm consoling myself with the fact that three pounds included the shells...yes, that's it!  And...no I didn't eat the shells.  So I really only ate maybe a pound or so of actual crawfish meat.  Anyway, the first two pounds were in the medium Cajun boil served with a corn cobbette and a potato.  The boil was flavorful with a light heat and the crawfish were of good size.  When I was done, I ordered another pound of crawfish in the spicy hot and juicy boil.  Great flavor, particularly with the garlic touch.  And those mudworms were large!  They looked like mini- lobsters.  I actually ate the claw meat, something I generally don't do given their small size.  After all, there is a limit to just how much work I want to do for a meal. Now, I know to just order the spicy boil flavors since I generally like foods with a high heat.  Before I forget, the sweet potato fries were good too.  I liked that our food server kept the coke cups full and the staff checked in often. \n\nMy companion ate the fried shrimp and the chicken wings with potato fries.  While he ate everything because he was hungry, he didn't particularly care for it.  I'm thinking that figures since the house specialty is the crawfish. But unfortunately, because these items are on the menu, they could use a bit more attention; hence, a four star rather than a five star rating.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and, importantly, so were the restrooms!  Now, if you're too prissy to eat with your hands and you have a problem with not using a plate, then this isn't the place for you, even though they give out nice bibs and you eat from a plastic table cover.  Keep in mind, you do eat from a plastic bag and you drink from styrofoam cups...okay so that's not environmentally friendly but who cares!?!  I even bought a tank shirt...and that's an unusual move for me.\n\nI'm thinking I'll definitely be back...and next time, I'll try shop No. 1 to see if it's as good as shop No. 2."

I've noticed that if I go in there with 1 person, we sort of get good service (and by that I mean we get checked on about 2 times), but otherwise if I go in there by myself, forget it. There is no service. Which is sad because I do tend to order a lot with proper service but when you're getting ignored even when you're sitting there twiddling your thumbs blatantly looking around for a waitress, it's frustrating. The crawfish are cleaned incorrectly (black and cracked, that's not right) my 2 lb bag had more claws than actual crawfish...that was seriously disappointing. I won't be going back, I tried to give it more than a few chances but every time I go, I'm quickly reminded why I didn't like it last time."

The atmosphere was nice and we were sat at a 8 person able even though there were only 5 of us, that's a plus because you'll need room when you eat this! \n\nI ordered 2 lb craw fish , 2 lb shrimp with corn and sausage and potatoes. I enjoyed the \"hot n juicy\" flavor, which is a blend of all of their flavor and got the \"medium\" spice. It was yummy and the shrimps were insanely big!! Crawfish were frozen but they still were tasty. Ordered Cajun fries-- they were ok, have had better.\n\nService: it was ok, that's why I'm giving the place only 4 stars. Our waitress asked if we have ever been there and we said \"no,\" she didn't care to explain the menu or anything to us. She took our orders and after that she or anyone didn't come to even check on us the whole time. For first timers I feel like she should've tried to be more enthusiastic and at least asked us 1x how it was going with the food. Overall, I would come again."

After many visits to las vegas, I finally was able to make the time to make a stop by Hot N' Juicy before heading home. Most people prefer Pho to cure their hangovers of course but I made it a point to try this before going back home this trip.\n\nI was never a huge fan of Crawfish but I am definitely a fan now! I've tried Crawfish at Boiling Crab and it never stuck to me the way Hot & Juicys did. I usually order Shrimp but after trying Hot & Juicys Crawfish, I've gotten a whole new perspective of cajun food. Their Crawfish was flavorful, soft and melts in your mouth type of seafood. Definitely worth the extra hardwork to peel for those little things!\n\nI did try their shrimp and I did not enjoy it very much. It seemed bland and the flavor was lacking. The shrimp just didn't seem as fresh as boiling crabs. I will just have to eat Crawfish at Hot N' Juicy from here on out but definitely worth it.\n\nThe service was good, they had a friendly staff and they were aware of their customers which I liked. 4/5 because it was great but the only downside was the Shrimp. Will be back for the Crawfish though!"

They are my true guilty pleasure!! I always get at least a pound or two and a side of Cajun Fries with extra seasoning, and wash it all down with their super inexpensive beers in a frosty mug.  \n\nI would, and could eat here at least once a week and never get sick of it.

The crawfish were kind of small in my opinion for the middle of the season. They also charge for getting extra crawfish sauce to dip in so be wary. We got the corn, sausages, black mussels, crawfish and shrimp in the hot n juicy flavor. The flavoring was decent, not bad but for the price and size I would think twice the next time. The sausage pieces they give you are tiny I would've thought they would come out as bigger pieces, but they're pretty thin and not worth it. The crawfish can be small, the mussels were the least satisfying, but the shrimp were the best here. The shrimp were good sizes and were very sweet tasting and flavor-some. Will probably try a different place before going here again."

Service was attentive (by multiple people) and one of the employees showed us how to peel/eat the crawfish. The sauce we chose for the food was garlic butter and it was fantastic.

We were greeted immediately and our server was very attentive. Presented me the different teas and, of course, I had to choose the sweet tea. With this being a Tuesday, it was a good time to get in here as its always crowded on the weekends. Overall, the crawfish was on point and so were my wife's shrimp. Make sure to get them boiled in the garlic butter, or other seasonings as it makes it that much better. If you have a chance to make it out during the week, please do it. It's not as crowded and they will take good care of you."

We waited maybe 5 more mins and then were seated.\n\nThe menu offers a variety of seafood in different flavors and spices.  We ordered the crawfish in Hot and Juicy flavor in a medium spicy level and shrimp in the Lemon Pepper flavor, also a medium spicy level and two pieces of corn.  \n\nThe food came out quickly and we put on our bibs and got to cracking.  I've never eaten a crawfish before so it was interesting.  It seems like a lot of work for not so much to eat.  But it was fun nonetheless.  After awhile, the spices got too spicy for me (on a medium level).  \n\nOf the two flavors, I definitely like the lemon pepper better.  But the best part of the meal...the corn!!"

The only thing I must say is that you do have to be willing to get over the giant shrimp heads, eyes, & whiskers! (I had no idea) What disappointed me though, was the service, the server didn't seemed interested in being there, and unconcerned when we asked questions. Also, the portions are very big when it comes to the shrimp! I asked the server if she thought I should get a half a pound or whole, and she answered that the half only came with a few shrimp and gave a face like not a good choice, so I got the full pound and my hubby not that big on shrimp, got the half. I wished I had a picture, but the half was more than a few shrimp, and perfect to suffice any shrimp lover, so I did feel misled, as far as that goes. Needless to say, I ended up giving my grandmother the rest of my shrimp from my pound! It also took a good 15 minutes to get someone to come by with our check, even after my husband told our server. I'm not sure if we will be returning to this location or even the restaurant for that matter due to the service, which I'm all about, lol. There are plenty of other places like this around, that probably make you feel  more welcome and have excellent service!"

So when my friend and I were in Vegas last week, we just had to try it. I didn't realize that there were 2 locations. We asked the taxi driver to take us to the original location but he didn't.  I was a bit disappointed. As soon as we were seated, that disappointment disappeared.. The table is covered in a big piece of plastic, roll of paper towels, and menus. Makes for easy cleanup. Trust me on that...Catlin was our server and she was the sweetest, nicest person ever! I had never had Crawfish before, she explained the menu, the process, and how to eat them to us. They serve most of the seafood by the pound with the exception of the shrimp, you can get them in half pound. You pick the seasoning (Louisiana Style , Juicy Cajun , Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper , Hot N Juicy Special(which is a combo of all of the seasonings)), then you order a spice level (I am a total spice whore, the hotter the better). They offered mild, medium, spicy and extra spicy. They serve it in a steaming bag that is opened on the table for you to enjoy. Catlin suggested that we go with the medium as it was hot and it builds as you eat. She said to try it and if we wanted it hotter we could order something else. We started out by ordering a pound of Crawfish cooked in the HNJ special seasoning with medium spice. OMG I cannot begin to tell you how good this was. The flavor makes my mouth water as I am typing this. The medium spice was perfect and was hotter than most mediums you have probably eaten. It was so good we ordered rolls to dip into the leftover sauce. And then the debauchery began.. Once we were about half way thru we decided to order the snow crab legs in the same flavor and spice level. Chunks of garlic on the crablegs....it was heaven.\nOh no, I am not finished...we then ordered 10 fried shrimp. These shrimp were butterflied, cooked in a catfish type batter. We also ordered the Cajun fries (which we couldn't even finish) but all of it was the best seafood I think I have ever had. Needless to say our table was strewn with shells, bags and lots of paper towels (yes us girls got our chow on, somethin fierce!) the whole bill came to under 60 dollars (including beers with dinner). If you are in Las Vegas GO, RUN!! to Hot and Juicy. You will not regret it! Had we had a little more time we would have went again before our flight on Friday. Next time were driving so we can take a cooler to bring back to Phoenix with us. Basically you can reheat the bags in boiling water and they will be just as good as if you were sitting at the table in Vegas."

It was pretty busy for a Friday at 3pm. There was a 30 minute wait so we went next door and all got 30 minute massages lol(awesome). So we come back and get seated at our table.  Waitress was super sweet and attentive\n Took our order,  put on those garbage bag bibs lol, and gloves.\n\nFood came out and man it was hott, like spicy hot.  Which is great but i had a runny nose after the first 2 bites but I didn't mind lol just caught me off guard.\n\nAll the food was just below great. The cajun fries were way to oily for my liking. The cajun calamari was good, but portion was small, the softshell crab was surprisingly good even thou I am not a fan of crab.\n\nOverall I'd enjoyed the experience with cause of my great friends, great service,  good food, and a break from the strip.\n\nI think the most fascinating part of this experience was looking around at how everyone sat there with tables packed with food and then nothing was left. So it's definitely an experience I'd recommed"

We had two servers that were helping my party of 4 and they were friendly, attentive and very fun. They made the experience even a better one. We were even given a \"girls of hot n juicy calendar\" that had a selection of their workers from different locations holding seafood. It was really funny and fun to look at. We got a kick  out of the model dressed up in an elegant gown holding up crab legs. My friend made a joke saying \"When you're classy AF but got crabs...\" hahaha. The waitress thought it was hilarious. She also gave us mardi gras beads and bud light bottle openers. It was a great dine in experience.\n\nI definitely like HnJ better than boiling crab! It still is fun but more warm (welcoming) and not as loud so you can actually hear what people at your table are saying.

You get stuff delivered in plastic bags, on a plastic table cloth, or in styrofoam soup cups. There isn't any silverware to speak of that I could see and fountain drinks come the same way. The prices are so-so. I had their etouffe. There's only one, and it's mudbug etouffe over rice. It was reasonably flavored, but over-seasoned with cracked pepper even for a Gulf Coaster. There is lobster, three kinds of crab (two missing, the least inexpensive) and an assortment of sides, like corn, sweet potato fries, and so forth. My limited sampling said that it's over-rated. \n\nTwo other clues. The parking lot is tiny and insufficient for a large patronage; parking up the side street if you dare. The waitresses don't really understand their menu, or their ingredients (two different ones). Although they were slammed with people, the waitresses seemed inexperienced and had a lot of stains on their clothes. Busing the tables amounts to lifting off the white plastic table cloths and dumping the trash, I guess. It's like eating on the top of a garbage bag. I expected something more authentic, some semblance of service, and a cut above a pre-trash table setting. You can probably do better elsewhere; this isn't even as good as Joe's Crab Shack. There is no decor save for a few Mardi Gras-ish things they must have found at a party store, has all of the ambience of a WalMart restroom."

Since then every time we go here it's at least 20-40 minute wait unless you get there before 5:30 pm.  I hate waiting and usually would not wait for anything...................... except for this darn hot n juicy crawfish!!  The minute you peel off the head and suck the tamale off the shell you remember why you wait 40 minutes to be seated (the waiting area is standing along the wall), drink off of styrofoam cups and plates and pay $10 a pound (I eat minimum of 5lbs).  Sounds like I'm bitching, but it's soooo damn good you forget about all the \"little\" inconvenience and just saviour the succulent crawfish.  Prepare yourself if you don't like spicy food.  Just a little advice and make sure you ask  for mild if you like medium in a Thai restaurant."

            "review": "One of my new favorite places to eat in Vegas!  I'm a Southern girl and grew up eating mudbugs (crawfish) piled high on backyard picnic tables.  It's next to impossible to find really good Cajun crawdaddies outside of the deep south so I usually avoid trying because I'm almost always disappointed.  I have found the mudbug holy trail though!!\n\nMy guy is a Yankee and my mom and I are on a mission to southernize him as best we can hehe.  So one night crawdaddies were brought up and I realized I had a major hankering for the little red guys I had heard good things about this place so I decided to give it a go so I could quench my craving and take my guy's crawdad virginity, two birds, one stone and all that hullabaloo. \n\nWe got there and there was about a twenty minute wait.  We had to wait outside cause the place is pretty packed with tables.  We were seated and our server was very nice and took the time to explain how things worked.  You order your protein (crawdaddies, shrimp, soft-shelled crabs etc) by the pound and choose your seasoning (Cajun, garlic butter etc) and they bring them out in bags.  No plates in this place...the tables are draped in plastic, there are plastic bibs available...you may look sill but they are definitely needed, those suckers might be small but they are seriously messy!  This is not the place to go if you plan to do anything afterwards.  \n\nWe ordered a couple pounds if crawfish with Cajun seasoning and an order of corn fritters.  I love spicy food, he doesn't.  It was a hit with us both, not too spicy and not too mild.  The fritters were divine and a good sized serving for the two of us. \n\nThe big bonus was the price.  The market price of the crawdaddies that day was $7/lb, the next day I was at the grocery store and there were frozen crawfish for $6.75 for a little under a pound and you still had to cook them and do the cleaning up afterwards.  I'd gladly pay a quarter more to not have to do the work!\n\nI haven't stopped raving about this place and keep dropping hints as often as I can that I'm jonsin' to go back.  I see some more head suckin' in my future (the heads are where all the yummy bits are, if you don't suck the heads you are mission out!) See y'all soon lil mudbugs!"

I thought I was crazy, since I seemed to be the exception to the rule...EVERYONE LOVES THIS STUFF. \n\nWell, I wanted to give it another stab. I really didn't like the flavors too much at boiling crab, and thanks HOT N JUICY, I have renewed hope!!! \nI loved the MILD sauce flavor A LOT, and it tasted VERY different from boiling crab or some other places I've tried. \n\nThe corn with the mild sauce was SEW GOOD. The shrimp was my fave! \nI love snow crab, but, it's hard since you can't get much of the sauce in the crab meat, and I just love snow crab on it's own.

We had the extra hot and it was perfect--not unbearably hot but it had a great flavor. The only warning I have about this place is that someone doesn't like seafood or the smell of seafood don't bring them with you. This is a must try place in Vegas at a very reasonable price.

START WITH MILD!!! I still remember the flash genocide of thousands of my taste buds when i took that first bite.\n\nService was great. Our server started off by informing us that because it's near the end of the mud bug's cycle the average size of the crawfish were smaller then usual. This saved a lot of grief and looks of WTH?! when the bags came. A majority of us where fine with the shrimp.\n\nAll and all an excellent night filled with laughter being exchanged between friends, shrimp and crawfish shells all over the table and everyone's garlic breath in the air.\n\nUnless Hot N Juicy finds a way to breed and farm crawfish to provide large mud bugs year long there's no way this place can improve on what it's already got going.\n\nAdditional note it's every entertaining seeing female diners wearing stylish 'going out' clothes and that plastic bib with large lobster squeezing a lemon trying to save them a dry cleaning bill.

It was our first time there so we got 2 lbs crawfish, a pound king crab legs, a pound of Dungeness crab and some Cajun fries.  We got the hot n juicy seasoning in medium and it was perfect!  Perhaps a bit salty for my taste but the flavors were explosive in a good way.  My tongue was dancing.  They use lots of garlic so you will smell like garlic afterwards.  Tip, if you use your bare hands, ask for some lemon wedges to wipe your fingers down to help tame the seafood and garlic smells before doing a final wash with soap and water.  Because soap and water alone isn't enough to combat the garlic!  I can eat spicy and the medium was spicy but not anything you can't handle.  My party doesn't eat too spicy so that's why we opted for the medium level.  But anywho, the crawfish that day was frozen but still they were so delicious!  The Dungeness crab was super juicy and soft.  Everything tasted so amazing that we put in another order of crawfish and crabs!  And we devoured about 11 lbs of shellfish altogether.  On top of that, we had fries and some baskets to wash it all down :). \n\nWish there was a hot n juicy where I live.  Come here to satisfy your Cajun shellfish hunger and come early for parking, totally worth camping out for this joint in the hot desert heat!"

It looked EXACTLY like The Boiling Crab in California and right then and there I knew I would be heading down to Hot N Juicy for a meal while I was in Vegas.\n\nIt's a seafood place were you order seafood by the pound.  You then choose what type of sauce you want your seafood brought to you in.  They have lemon pepper, cajun, garlic butter etc and you can choose a level of spiciness.  You can also get items added to your seafood like sausage, corn and potatoes.  \n\nThey have the regular sides like rice, fries etc.\n\nOnce you place your order they bring you a bib and a few minutes later you're brought a bag of delicious juiciness with the seafood that you ordered.\n\nThis time I ordered a pound of snow crabs in lemon pepper sauce and a pound of shrimp in cajun sauce.  I got my order a little spicy.\n\nThey were both fantastic and at a pretty reasonable price.  The shrimp was $10 and the snow crabs were $17 per pound each.\n\nYou're guaranteed to be a mess after this meal so you might as well get down and dirty!"

Since they don't take reservations, I planned to put our name down early and wait before everyone else got there. The wait was at least 30 minutes when we got there. By the time everyone showed up, it had been 40 minutes, however, the hostess came out to inform us that they were preparing our table! Wonderful timing and within another five minutes, we had a table in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nThe food was delicious and with a large group, the experience was so much fun! I don't normally like getting dirty or using my hands, but with the bibbs, plastic gloves, cracker, sheller, and paper towels, it made dinner very enjoyable. I ordered a pound of the KING CRAB LEGS (market price today was $25.99/lb) with the Hot N Juicy Special (all the seasonings combined) in Medium. Oh, it was so tasty and those legs were huge! It was challenging with thin plastic gloves and legs with gigantic spikes, so I utilized three pairs of gloves and several paper towels. I think there needs to be gardening gloves and/or real towels for those heavy duty crab legs! It can be pretty dangerous. Ruben and I also ordered the calamari and Cajun fries. All delicious! But that Hot N Juicy Special seasoning/sauce, WOW.\n\nWonderful, wonderful place. The service was just okay, but I know they're busy and honestly, you're so consumed with wrestling crab legs that you forget your server hasn't checked on you.

Can't really eat them without rice in my opinion. I recommend ordering their sausage too. It was very yummy with their garlic butter seasoning.

The only thing I dislike is that this place is dark , im not blind lol but I don't like eating in dark , spice that light up a little , the music was on point , of course I danced , lol . I blame the shrimp! Aha . \n\nI recommend anybody who loves shrimp to go here , because it's the best shrimp by far ! \n\nThe other thing I dislike about it and it has nothing to do with the place , you actually leave with the smell as well lol and I pumped my perfume so much times that the smell of it wont go any where im like \"Omg I still can smell it.\" But then again who knows , maybe it's telling me to go back lol . \n\nI will definitely be back for more shrimp , maybe MORE then a pound this time. Lol\n\nThank you Hot n' Juicy for your great hospitality! I'm very appreciated !"

The shrimp and crab legs were better though. I liked the hot n juicy special medium (which was super spicy the first time I came and milder the second time) and my boyfriend was a big fan of the lemon pepper mild. Sweet potato fries were awesome as well. The cajun fries were a bit spicy which would have been okay but my mouth was already burning from the seafood. Beers are cheap.\n\nDefinitely a fun eating experience as well. I would recommend the trip if you are in Vegas."

I have heard they have another location now to ease the congestion of the crustacean mayhem.\n\nThe Hot n Juicy Special is the only way to go. I usually get the medium but be prepared to reach for those paper towels to wipe your running nose. It's spicy but not unbearable and the taste of the sauce is still recognized by your palette which I believe makes for a perfect balance. Make sure you get enough corn for each person or you better be ready for the ensuing fight that's going to break out.\n\nMy first and last stop every time I go to Vegas so you know it's that good."

There were a good 18 or so of us there and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. The servers were very friendly and helpful. The place was packed but the food came out really quick once it was ordered. I had Blanche meet me there and neither of us were into the whole eating crawfish and messy thing so we took the easy way out and got some baskets.\nI ordered the Fried Shrimp basket (10pieces) for around $10.00 and a side order of sweet potato fries for $4.50. Blanche ordered the Fried Catfish basket that comes with fries for $9 and change.\nThe fried shrimp was delicious. Cooked perfectly and nice size pieces of shrimp. However, at pretty much a dollar a shrimp I thought it was very overpriced.\nThe sweet potato fries I could eat every day. So good. A bit overpriced at nearly $5 for a medium size basket of fries but oh well.\nBeer was $2.50 for domestics and $3 for imports. Not bad. Was a little disappointed to have them run out of Bud Light after the first one I ordered. I usually don't like switching beers once I start drinking one but I made an exception to try a Blue Moon.\nOverall it was a cool place and everyone else seemed to be having fun \"playing\" with their food. Or maybe its \"working\" on their food because it seemed like it got difficult at times.\nOn a last note.. I do wish they would work on the temperature in their. I think it was cooler outside."

He first said \"So is it your first time here?\" and I say yes, he says with (ugh)\"it seems like its everyone's first time here today...\" and goes on about how to order and everything.  We've been to other similar seafood places like this back home so we are not totally new to this type of place, but it was our first time.. still, whatever.\n\nThe Hot n Juicy sauce here is awesome!  We ordered regular spicy, but I think we could handle extra spicy!  Its a nice garlic-buttery-spicy sauce.  My friend ordered the Garlic Butter sauce but it was not good at all.  \n\nThe king crab legs are huge, and one order came with only 4 legs.  I was a little disappointed because the seafood places back home (very similar to this) serve more legs.\n\nThe food also took forever to get to us.  We got our orders really far apart from each other, and they seemed to forget our rice.  The servers were prompt with filling our drinks though."

Somehow there is also a Cajun style crawfish restaurant in the smack dab middle of it.\n\nOne of my favorite things right of the bat is the eat-in style - roll of paper towels, plastic single-use table covers, and bibs. They know yo' ass is gonna make a mess. And because their food is fresh, this is not a pun!\n\nThe shrimp and crawfish are a nice hefty size. Not the itty bitty crap you would get at Sizzler. However, if you cone hungry and have your eyes set on crawfish, you have to realize that there is a small ratio of edible meat per square inch. It's only the tail. Shrimp is a better option in this respect.  \n\nIf you are really hungry, which is completely possible if there is a wait and you stand outside, watching people eat through the window, they have a great fried food menu, including chicken, crab, catfish, shrimp, and fries.\n\nThe shrimp, crawfish, and other fish is available in several flavors, ranging from mild to cajun to hot-n-juicy.  It comes out in a nice plastic bag with the sauce.  All get nicely fumed with flavor after they are boiled.  Pair that with a nice cold brew and you will understand the draw of this place.  \n\nI hope this wasn't a mirage in the middle of the desert and this place really does exist."

I ordered the snow crab with the  spicy hot and juicy seasoning; I was told it was the best and most popular, so of course I wanted to try that one first. The extras were very favorable with the hot and juicy seasoning and  is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,  potatoes(.60 cent), sausage(1/2 dozen 2.45) and corn( i believe .75) . I now know  any other sides or anything extra aren't needed. I ordered a side of butter( which is a dollar extra) and didn't even touch it. \n\nAlso important: the customer service was great! Everyone was so nice and smiled with their service. HUGE plus for me! Last comment, I suggest that whenever you go don't come all dressed up because although this meal is  incredible it can also be very messy, which is the reason for the commentary bid and gloves that are given.

Sadly, I was let down by Adam Richman and all of my fellow Yelpers.\n\nShortly after we were seated, the waitress warned us that Hot N Juicy's spice levels were much higher than your \"typical restaurant\" and advised us to go for a lower spicy level when we ordered our shrimp. Taking her advice, we went with a milder sauce. We noticed a lot of things wrong when we got our shrimp:\n\n- There was absolutely no \"juice\" in the bag. We have been to similar restaurants where the shrimp/crawdads are served in the \"juice\" to give added flavor. Considering that this restaurant is called \"Hot N Juicy\", we were both expecting JUICY.\n\n- The shrimp had absolutely no flavor to them. It literally tasted like they boiled a bag of shrimp in water and served it to us. Again, considering that this restaurant is called \"Hot N Juicy\", we were both expecting HOT.\n\nWe asked for a hotter sauce on the side to dip our shrimp in since we were let down by the sauce we ordered. The waitress was kind enough to come back with a small container of their \"Hot N Juicy\" sauce. This was also very subpar - it tasted like a blend of marinara sauce with a hint of Tabasco. Again, the sauce was not spicy at all. I think its important to note that my girlfriend and I aren't huge fans of spicy food. When we do order wings or shrimp, we tend to go for a medium level of spiciness due to our own sensitivities with spicy food. That being said, nothing in this restaurant (that we tried) is even remotely spicy.\n\nWe also ordered a side of calamari. These were ok, but considering the price for the order it was not worth it. \n\nThe only saving grace for this restaurant is the ambiance and decor. The restaurant itself has a cool modern look, is very well air conditioned (which is a big thing for me) and plays good music. I would come here to buy a beer but would stay the hell away from the food."

But I guess in Las Vegas you can't get that much better.  \n\nWhat we ordered:\n4 lbs crawfish (2 lb Hot n juicy special & 2 juicy Cajun)\nThe Juicy Cajun was a lot better in my opinion.  The medium was not spicey. \n\nThe spicy was good. You could taste it on the corn but not so much the crawfish.  It seemed like it was not boiled in the sauce and the sauce was tossed on afterwards.  The flavor had not soaked into the crawfish.\n\nI don't usually comment about the cleanliness of bathrooms, but man...these bathrooms were gross.  Trash was everywhere.\n\nService: Waitress was friendly enough. Looks like the trendy place to be. But I'd rather not get my crawfish in LV.  Probably would not eat here the next time we visit."

I have also tried their original location up the street but this particular spot just speaks to me in volumes. The service is phenomenal and I never have to wave a server down for drink refills. This is definitely my go-to spot for crawfish cravings and with that being said...I will see you in an hour Hot N Juicy!"

My husband and I each orderd 2lb of crawfish which came with a small ear of corn and a red potato. I had the mild and it was just the right amount of spice for me, and i'm not really a fan of spicy food.  I did find that I was still hungry so I ordered some etouffe and oh man let me tell you that stuff is the business. It's kinda similar to a gumbo as it's a seafood soup served over rice. So if you're into crawfish or other seafood for that matter cooked in a spicy boil this place is for you!"

Came here a little while ago with some out of town friends and had a 30 minute wait for a group of 6 which seems to be the norm now since its been on TV foodie shows. Compared to the first time I came here there was no wait. Once we were seated we were quickly served by the cute waitresses whom a friend repeatedly flirted with but was shot down ;P  We ordered several 2lbs bags of crawfish in different flavors and several appetizers like the catfish, fried shrimp, and soft shell crabs. Everything was spiced nicely which they inform(warn) you that it is hotter than you might expect. The crawfish is live when they are cooked we were told, and that frozen were available because some peeps don't like it for some reason but I do notice the meat is a lot more tender. Don't wear your whites and prepare to dig in!"

Sometimes your sides will come in the bags as well (sausage, or corn on the cob).  You can experiment with different sauce combos.  You get to wear a bib and gloves so you don't get dirty, but you will somehow manage to get sauce on your pants or something.  It's a pretty novel concept.  Service here is excellent!

This type of seafood is not my favorite but i tried a half pound of shrimp with hot n juicy flavor and BABY SPICE level LOL. I cant take spicy at all and my friends gave me a lot of shit for getting baby spice so beware hahaha. But it was really good and i can definitely see the appeal of this restaurant. The only thing is that it felt really chaotic there which is understandable on a friday night. However our servers and food runners were really confused or something. Like 4 different people asked us about these 2 pounds of medium shrimp and we was like nah son we already got it!! They also overcharged us and we had to get that fixed. It was hectic in there. Also apparently theres this ongoing debate of hot n juicy vs boiling crab. I def need to try boiling crab so i can choose a team. I will come back an update zont worry. 3 stars because service was spotty and they didnt have corn fritters WHICH I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING :( \n\nI came here like 3 days ago...

Our server, Emeli, was fantastic and went well beyond the call of duty not only to take fantastic care of us, but also took the time to explain what to expect and was full of useful information on ever aspect of the menu.  Hot & Juicy should be proud to have her a member of their team!\n\nI should mention that I have grown up in and around the ocean and I'm very familiar with seafood in every respect.\n\nThe concept of this restaurant is that the patrons are delivered the food in plastic bags, to tables that are covered with disposable table cloths.  Each diner is provided a bib and surgical gloves( for those that don't want to get their hands dirty) and each table has a roll of paper towels. If you require a shower when you're done dining is up to you.\n\nWe found the food exceptionally fresh and tasty.  There were only two of us and we ordered several items.  Shrimp, Muscles and a Dungeness Crab.  Shrimps are severed with the heads on and not cleaned.  When you eat shrimp, you need to clean and devein them.  Peeling Shrimp are quite simple but deveining them with wet hands at the table is quite impossible.   This is no way to eat shrimp and I'm sure the owners of Fresh & Juicy know this. It's obviously much more economical for the restaurant not to clean, de-head and devein the shrimp and have the customer do it.  I'm not sure if most of their customers know to do this and can remove the vein. Again, almost impossible with wet hands and no implements.\n\nThe bill for two people ............................\nWe had one pound of shrimp, one pound of muscles and one Dungeness Crab, and a total of four domestic beers........$92 without a 23% tip. (Again, Emeli was fantastic) We were instructed to just put all of the shells directly on the table. As dining progressed, the table looked more and more like the pigs were feeding! Sorry, but this is not my \"thing\".\n\n I don't mind paying $92 price for fresh seafood but I personally don't enjoy dining like a pig with plastic table cloths, crab shells and shrimp shells and head,  a roll of paper towels, in an atmosphere that is more in line with a fast food establishment.  I might have a different attitude if the bill was $40 but I know this is not possible for good seafood.  \n\nThe bottom line is if you want to enjoy fresh, tasty seafood, eat it like a pig and are not price sensitive, this is your place for seafood.  I know it's not a place for me.  Try it for yourself and either way, at least you can form your own opinion.  I would have given this restaurant four stars for quality, freshness and taste and now you now know the rest."

Our waitress was very nice and sweet and the best thing was the fries and our waiter who brought our drinks out. The catfish was very and the fries were crispy but had a little too much salt for my taste. Also we told Josh that the drinks did not taste like it had any alcohol, in which he told us he has heard that before.. he apologized and asked the manager if he could take it off our bill and that person said no. So in all we paid for drinks that were horrible with no taste and dry seafood. I would definitely not come back to this establishment."

You get to pick the level of spiciness, and a type of sauce you want to accompany the seafood of your choice.  We chose 1 lbs of shrimp (about$11/lbs) level 3 spiciness in the hot and juicy sauce.

There was a long line of people waiting outside.  It was a Thursday night.  The staff told it was a 45 minutes wait, so we decided to go cross the street and go grocery shopping.  I wanted to buy some fruits and snacks for the hotel.  By the time we got back, we were directed to our table.  I've heard such good things about this place from my girlfriends who were locals, skinny, extremely glamorous, and they can eat!   The bachelorette ordered 1 lb of shrimp with the Hot & Juicy special sauce, garlic fries, and I ordered 1 lb of crawfish as well as buttered corn on the cob.   They all come out piping hot in a plastic bag.  We received a bib however,  we did not get any gloves as did some of my fellow yelpers.  I guess we didn't order enough food?  My buttered corn was completely soaked in butter and spices, it was so salty and soft.  I couldn't eat it.  I just wanted boiled corn and they said I had to be more specific.  You had to say boil corn or something.  My waiter was horrible.  He wasn't that attentive.  He gave me attitude because he had to take that corn back and gave me a different corn.  My 2nd corn was still super soft and with tons of butter.  I was super disappointed.  I love corn too!   Ah, did I forget to mention that I had to ask where my corn was?  He had forgotten to place an order of the corn.  He didn't even apologize for forgetting.  He just brought out that soggy salty corn.  Anyway, on to the review of the rest of the meal, it was yummy!  The crawfish was fresh.  All the shells were hard and not soft.  So that's how you would know if the crawfish is fresh or not.  The flavors of the garlic and spices were so good.  It was definitely a finger licking experience.  For the two of us, 1 lb each on shrimps and crawfish was enough.  I don't normally eat that much shrimp, but crawfish I can eat a lot of.  I'd recommend coming to this place for the experience, maybe not so much for the corn.  It was actually kind of neat to see them serving white rice as a side dish.  Next time I visit Vegas, I'm definitely coming back.  We have a Crawfish King in Seattle and I do not like that place at all.  I'll do a review on that place later."

The flavors were all pretty good, although I preferred the Hot-n-Juicy flavor and the cajun one was also very good.  The food came by the pound, and when we asked how much to order she told us about a pound per person.  This was way too much!  But I can never be mad at someone for suggesting a lot of food, it will all get eaten at some point, right?  \n\nThe food was relatively cheap, at around $10 per pound of each type of seafood.  We got the shrimp and the crawfish, and wish I would have tried the Dungeness crab, it sounded really good.  \n\nIf you're looking for a fun meal to grab with friends, definitely try out Hot n Juicy Crawfish.

Very attentive and our server even showed us how to properly de-shell and eat crawfish.  My group had an interesting situation while waiting.  The place was full and their was a sign that read \"please wait to be seated\".  So we stood in line at the door and waited.  There was a host that was taking down names for the waiting list so i tried to get his attention to put my name down but he was very busy cleaning the tables and told me to wait.  So i patiently waited only to see people come in behind me and walk up to him and he wrote their names down.  I figured he was smart and courteous enough to realize that i've been standing their waiting especially since we were blocking the aisle and he had to constantly excuse himself from walking past us.  Of course he sits other's before me and i have to go up to him and ask him about my table.  Expectantly, he tells me i'm next and to just be patient.  I honestly feel that this was an isolated situation on my party and shouldn't reflect their overall great customer service but i thought i should share my experience.

Thanks to yelpers, I now have another great place to add to my list.\n\nThis was not only a great place to grab some food, but reasonably priced with very friendly servers and a fun experience. Just make sure you don't have any paper cuts because you will be using your hands! And if you get some of the spicy seasoning, then beware!\n\nThey do provide you with a bib, which I needed. Actually, I needed two since I ripped the first one and it became unusable. Fail on my part. Coupled with the plastic on the table and the paper towels, you do not wear your Sunday best here, unless you'd like it covered in their delicious sauces.\n\nI had the shrimp, calamari, and a bowl of rice. Wanted to try the crawfish but I had a craving for shrimp. Maybe next time, I come to Vegas often!"

This place is in such an unsuspecting area and the parking lot a  little tiny.  But once you open the door the sweet smell of butter and garlic fill the room.  There was a little wait which I was surprised about bc places like this in LA have an hour wait minimum!! \n\nThe food was good!! My bf and I got the Hot N Juicy Special, Spicy on shrimp.  I'd get the crawfish but I was too tired to put in the effort for such a small amount of meat.  We also ordered the deep fried soft shell crabs with corn & cajun fries.  LOVE LOVE LOVED the soft shell crabs!! They were soo tasty and so crabby!  I just wish they had more in that basket!  I believe it only came with like 8 or something like that but I could have definitely went for another basket if I wasn't concerned with spending too much $$$ there.  The shrimp was awesome but almost TOO spicy!! I love heart in my food but this made my lips burn so I prob could have went medium on them.  But the shrimp were decently sized and cooked perfectly.  I hate when shrimp are overcooked but HNJ did not disappoint in that aspect.\n\nGreat place to go if you are craving some seafood southern style!  Be prepared to get down a dirty because eating with your hands is a MUST!!! Get those napkins ready..you'll be needing them =]"

Some of these crustaceans were larger in size than at most places I've gone to.  The shrimp was my favorite though.  Same spices as the crawfish, but more juicy and meaty.  We also ordered sausage, corn, and Cajun fries...which were all just okay for me.  \n\nCustomer service was top notch here...I just wish they were open later than 10 pm.  \n\nWe learned that the Man vs. Food show will be taping at this restaurant.

This place was featured on Man V. Food and that has probably contributed to its popularity and thus is packed pretty much all the time, combined with limited seating and almost no parking makes for a rough start to the meal.  However, the seafood is great... fittingly named, everything was hot n juicy.  King crab legs were my favorite, they were huge and deliciously seasoned in their own cajun spices.  The crawfish were an interesting experience.  They were tasty, but i'm one of those people who doesn't like to work for his food that hard.  Whole shrimp were also great, everything, like the crab, came cooked with their cajun spices.  Had some fries on the side and couple of beers, and a messy bib and many napkins later it proved to be a pretty good meal.  All in all a great experience, but unless you're a huge cajun seafood fan there's not a lot of replay value here.  If you're in town and want a fun and interesting meal, check it out."

I just love the atmosphere of the whole place..from the garlic smell (that follows you through your clothing for the rest of your day by the way) to the get-down-and-dirty style.  Some things just taste better eating with your hands and this is one of those occasions.  Seating did not take very long and our server was very friendly and helpful.  He explained the system to us and forewarned us that even mild has a kick to it since it is a Cajun restaurant.  My lips were burning by the end of my meal with mild, so if you don't like spicy food, do not come here!\n\nWe ordered snow crab legs since the blue crab and the dungeness crab were out (that was upsetting).  We got it with the Hot n Juicy seasoning, which the server explained did not mean it was spicy, but was a combination of all the other sauces.  It comes in a plastic bag, so we put on our plastic bibs and dug in!  It was delicious...the crab was meaty and the seasoning was just right.  Just thinking about the taste right now makes my mouth water.  We also ordered the sweet potato fries.  Maybe you would have better luck, but if you want my honest advice, do not order those!  They were soggy and gross.\n\nThis is a must try if you have never experienced anything like this.  I would definitely come here again.  Do not wear nice clothes here if you plan to go clubbing afterwards, keep an open mind, and enjoy!"

If you had Boiling Crab, the \"whole shebang\" is definitely better than the \"hot n juicy\" seasoning. The service sucks! Our server didn't even stop by to check on us if we needed anything so we had to get some random server's attention to get us something we needed. I asked for a sheller and was told that they don't have enough utensils so I'm going to have to wait until the other customer's done with it. Three other tables next to is were told the same thing. How about investing in some cheap plastic ones, especially that you're on a seafood business. Oh yeah... The crawfish tasted old. As far as pricing is concerned, it's cheaper than Boiling Crab, but you get what you paid for. I'd say... Boiling Crab is waaaaayyyy better--- hands down!"

It was messy and delicious and we got Cajun spices all over our beer glasses. :) \n\nI have no idea how much it cost because my buddy grabbed the bill, but we got 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of crab and 2 pounds of mussels to split between three people. It sounds like alot, but it was just enough, actually. Plus it came with a little corn on the cob and a little potato for each of us. We chose the medium level of spice, which was plenty spicy for me! \n\nSo this is food you have to WORK for. You have to tear the heads and legs off of the shrimp and peel them and you have to crack open your crab legs and pry the meat out. But it's WORTH it! The mussels required NO work and were delicious. The shrimp was, ya know, shrimp. The crab was delectable - I freakin' love a good juicy piece of crab meat. :) \n\nWe felt like three ravenous animals tearing apart food with our hands and leaving a mess of shells and sea creature parts behind. Awesome. \n\nMy boyfriend was not a fan of the chicken tenders he ordered; he said they were slightly worse than the kind you buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. And they didn't have BBQ sauce, just ketchup and not-so-good ranch. So yeah. Get the seafood."

Anyways, so we are in Vegas and heard that this place was similar to The Boiling Crab & Crab Hut so we decided to check it out!\n\nService: was kind, our waitress was helpful and attentive.\nAtmosphere: pretty spacious, had a good amount of seating, and it seems to be bigger than the other location next to Mr.Tofu.\n\nFood: my bf & I shared 1 1/2lb of shrimp, mild, in hot n juicy sauce, fried catfish basket w/cajun fries, and two corn. Verdict?\n\nPro: The hot n juicy sauce has a nice kick to it & pretty flavorful and it was nicely smothered over the shrimp. The two half corn on the cob was nearly drenched into the sauce which made the corn sweet from its own juices yet hot/juicy from the sauce. I also got to try my friend's corn fritters because I was curious to see how it tasted and to my liking it was awesome. I like the creamy yet sweet texture that happens when the corn ball is dipped into the batter and then fried. \n\nEh: the \"cajun fries\" ... about them fries, it clearly wasn't cajun fries but merely fries with a splash of cajun seasoning over it. It was not the same... not what I imagined and had experienced at The Boiling Crab. Slightly disappointed, but at least the fries were not bad. \n\nCon: From the outside the crust appears to be crunchy but when I bit into the crust of the fried catfish I was in awe. It doesn't appear to be crunchy but semi chewy or had an interesting texture to it. The catfish was okay not as fresh. \n\nOverall, I didn't come here for the crawfish because I'm not really a big fan of that but I did enjoy some parts of my meal if not all. It was a good experience to try a new place but I think I have to stick to The Boiling Crab as still my favorite go to place for this type of meal."

I wrote this on the receipt though I'm sure the girl was happy to receive a tip at all, regardless.\n\nCook it at home. You'll impress her more and save yourself the money and hassle of being underserved by a barage of young waitresses who could really care less about seeing you off happy. \n\nLG"

The newer place has a strong smell of paint, but that will easily be musked by the shrimps and crawfishes. Their sauces are pretty spicy and known to numb and swollen lips. If you are sensitive to spicy, start off with the mild. There are several choices of sauces and spicy levels to choose from. Prepare to get messy.

As for me, it's just A-OK.\n\nThey have really great service here.  Even though we were here with only half the party, they sat the first half and let us order first.  It took over 30 minutes for the other half of our party to arrive.  That was really accommodating.\n\nI had some of the shrimp and corn with the hot'n'juicy seasonings.  It was good and what I expected out of this place.  Decently fresh seafood with some spices.\n\nThe things I don't like about these places are that they aren't environmentally friendly at all.  You're doing this picnic style with plastic bags, styrofoam cups, plastic utensils.  They even dole out rolls of paper towels.

Don't get me wrong...I still really like Boiling Crab, but Hot N' Juicy was just excellent. \n\nHow could that possibly be you ask? \n\n1) The equivalent to the \"Whole Sha-Bang\" was a lot less garlicky and overwhelming. I didn't leave the restaurant feeling like crap...and I wasn't still tasting the garlic the day after. \n\n2) The food tasted a bit healthier (if that is even possible). Hot N' Juicy uses a little less butter, but it didn't seem to take away from the flavors - still leaving me craving for more. \n\n3) The catfish was delicious. I haven't had the catfish at Boiling Crab so I can't really compare, but the catfish was perfectly juicy, crispy on the outside, and the tarter sauce was delicious. \n\n4) There was a soup/stew-like dish (soup with Crawfish served with rice) was delicious. You can only eat so much shrimp and Crawfish, so this was a nice balance to the high-cholesterol meal. \n\n5) The wait wasn't as bad. I came here with a friend and her family (party of 4) on a Saturday night and waited only about 20-25 minutes (the restaurant is off the strip). \n\n6) You get a bit of a discount if you pay with cash (It's not like I can take advantage of this offer since I never have cash - but I thought I would throw that in there anyways). \n\nOverall - great meal! I always love the ambiance!"

Honestly, I feared sharing this little desert jewel with everyone and they mama...but I guess when something's that good, word spreads like an LA wildfire.\n\nBackground: I'm from CA.  I've never been to Lousiana but I have been to Crawdaddy's (SJ, CA), Boiling Crab (SJ, CA) and Hot n Juicy.  My first experience eating cajun seafood was at Hot n Juicy about 4 years ago.  Ever since then, I became an instant fan.  I've located cajun seafood restaurants closer to my place of residence, hence Crawdaddy's and Boiling Crab.  Anyhow, by far, Hot n Juicy blows the other two out the water, HANDS DOWN!!  I just went to Hot n Juicy over the July 15th weekend and the ish was BOMB DIGGITY!!!  Their crawfish was huge.  Usually I think you get about 13-15 critters per lb, this time the crawfish were so big, we got about 8-9 per lb. But so worth it, I mean they were so big, I even ate the critters' claws...OMG! - tell me the last time you had a crawfish so big, you could eat their claws?\n\n** As some of you may be aware, I'm allergic to shell fish but DAMN, I make sure to bring my benadryl so I can grub out without having to break out in itchy hives.  That's how good Hot n Juicy is.  \n\nBTW, if you didn't know:  They have now added King Crab legs...man, I might die from OD'ing on shellfish that I know I really shouldn't be indulging in...GLUTTONY\n\nFor those of you looking to compare:  It has been a toss up between Boiling Crab in SJ, CA and Hot n Juicy.  After I got back from Las Vegas, I went to Boiling Crab to make sure I ate at both places within a short time span so as to keep flavors and experience fresh in my mind....well (drum roll please.....HOT n JUICY TAKES THE CAKE).  Hot n Juicy has at a minimum 2 more secret ingredients that BC doesn't have.  The intense spicy flavors are there at HnJ (Hot n Juicy special) without the thick oilyness that BC has in their Whole Shabang."

We had our bibs tied tight, gloves on comfortably and big empty stomach ready. Game on!\n\nIn order to make a proper assessment on this fine establishment, I ordered what I typically order at Boiling Crab. 1 lb. of shrimp w/ garlic butter medium and a basket of catfish. \n\n1 lb. shrimp -- Pretty good-sized shrimp, comparable to Boiling Crab. However, the seasoning is a lot better at Boiling Crab. Not only was there a thick layer of oil but the flavor seemed to be missing something. Even when we re-dipped our peeled shrimp, it still tasted bland.\n\nCatfish basket -- 4 pieces of thickly cut catfish fillets. Thick, juicy with a nice layer of breading. It was appetizing but still fell short. I'd prefer to get them from Boiling Crab. However, their cajun fries were a huge surprise. I think they were spicier than our shrimp seasoning. \n\nService was great. Everyone was on their A-game. A few different waiters/waitresses came by to check up on us. The place is just alright but I'd rather save my spicy-seafood-served-on-a-table fix for Boiling Crab."

My mom brings her own dishwashing gloves to crawfish boils, but they will provide you some plastic ones upon request. \n\nTook Yelper advice and got half a pound of shrimp. Shrimp were slightly overcooked. After you peel it, dunk it around in the sauce so it can get more flavor on it! Sauces are nice. \n\nWe also got the fried cajun calamari, and it's really not good... just generic fried frozen calamari that is overly tough. Don't get that.\n\nCrawfish itself is not in season now, so expectation management is always important. They will likely inform you that it is frozen. A pound of it won't get you very far though.  \n\nSome of the girls working there will tell you \"mild\" is actually \"medium\" for most people, but I would disagree. Mild tastes like \"mild\" with just a minor punch to it.\n\nService was great. The girls working were all very sweet and nice.\n\nFor calamari, half a pound of shrimp, a pound of crawfish, a half order of sausage, two potatoes, and a Diet Coke, our total was $33 before tip. It's not exactly cheap for frozen seafood. A fun experience for locals that have no where else to turn for a seafood boil, but a little on the price-heavy side."

He have tried this place tons of times before and since he hyped this place up so much, I had to try it myself.\n\nThe first day, we tried 2lbs of crawfish, crab legs, and shrimp. We also got the cajun fries, which is a good compliment to all those seafood. We got everything with the hot and juicy mild sauce because this was what my cousin recommended. Everything was so good, but I didn't really like the crawfish. They are small and requires more time to eat than the shrimp and crab legs. You also get very little out of the crawfish. I would not recommend this. The shrimp and crab legs are really good and the sauce was perfect!\n\nThe second time we came back here was a few days later. We came back with a bigger group and ordered a storm again. This time we only ordered shrimp, crab legs, and cajun fries again. Everything was once again perfect and I wanted to come back here again before we left back to Chicago. Sadly, this was my last time here and till this day, I would come here as my 1st stop after landing in Vegas. I also must say that after all this food, my gf and uncle threw up afterwards. Everyone else was fine though.\n\nI also heard that this location is better than the other location, but I have never tried the other one yet.

I'm a huge fan of Boiling Crab so I was excited that this was the same concept- and with NO WAIT.  For all those BC fans out there, you know this is a big deal.  Spicy levels are higher than the norm and ever so slightly pricier.  No big deal.  Service is awesome- we happened to be one in like 2 years to find a sea creature in one of our bags that looked similar to a cockroach, gross!!  They took the bags away, called the managers and confirmed it's just a sea creature that sometimes doesn't get filtered out.  Phew!  They recooked another order and comped ALL the shrimp at our table.  All we paid for was an order of fries, rice, and coke. Totally awesome business in my eyes!\n\n4 stars only because the coveted 5 stars belongs to BC."

It's gonna get a little messy...\n\nYou can order your sauce mild to extra spicy. Us \"wimps\" ordered a bag of mild and a bag of medium (sorry, I like to enjoy my food while not having my mouth numb with fire).  Actually, compared to other places I've been to, their mild was like medium  and medium was HOT HOT HOT! but it was all good. I was still able to enjoy the taste because the spicyness didn't really bite, it just built up as I came close to finishing the bag.\n\nI prefer shrimp over the crawfish because the shrimp is meatier and well worth peeling over the crawfish. The calamari rings and fries we ordered was a nice filler to absorb some of that spice!"

None of us had been here before, but I am pretty sure all of us are returning soon!\n\nWe ordered two pounds of crawfish, and a pound each of shrimp and snow crab.  We opted for the Hot n Juicy sauce, medium spice.  The spice level of the sauce was right about on for us (although we may go hotter next time!), and the flavor was extremely good.  It was some sort of a garlic sauce that made sucking the juices out of these crustaceans so addicting.  \n\nThe shrimp were by far our favorite.  Nice and big in size, and juicy.  They weren't that hard to peal really, with the heads on them.  The crawfish were also tasty, although there was a lot less meat in them (obviously).  I am not a big crawfish eater, but these were so damn good that I probably would get them again just for the experience of cracking them open!  The money paid for the crawfish versus how much meat you get might not be worth it to some, but the experience is worth it to me.  The blue crab legs were few, but large and extremely delicious!\n\nI can't wait to come back, so Hot n Juicy is getting a 5 star review from me.  The waitresses are cute and friendly and they'll make sure you know how to crack those shellfish!  This place definitely deserves the A+ reputation that it has earned."

Highly compared to Boiling Crab in southern California, Hot N Juicy doesn't delve much from the popular food-in-a-bag chain. I'm not too sure if the food comes out based on when the guests get there or when the food is done but often times, I've noticed it comes out really randomly. Sometimes, the other guests got their food before me when I ordered before them.  If you're looking for a mirror of Boiling Crab, Hot N Juicy is it.\n\nI'd recommend something different to make this restaurant a gem in Las Vegas and not a copy of Boiling Crab.

Located in Chinatown, less than 10 minutes from the Strip, this joint was also featured on Man Vs. Food. I honestly wasn't looking too forward to eating here (I'm not huuuuuuge on seafood) but my bf really was, so I manned up and we went.\n\nWe ordered 2 lbs of the Hot & Juicy special sauce + medium spice level. The waitress did warn us that their spice levels are a little higher than most places, but I thought \"Eh, it'll be fine.\" No! No! Not fine! This is liquid death! But it hurts SOOOOOOOOO good. The sauce is succulent and ridiculously flavorful. But it burns, all the way down to your soul. Oh boy does it burn. Be careful of what you order. After a while I couldn't even taste what was happening, the crawfish were so hot. I recommend getting a side dish (we got rice) to help soak up the heat, it really helps. It also is awesome that they offer free refills on your drinks, because trust me, you TOTALLY need it. After every bite I needed a huge gulp of cold liquid.\n\nOh, and after you eat here, make sure you're going to be very close to a toilet for the next couple of hours. Oh!

Out of all the seasonings, their namesake is the best at the second to hottest level. Their \"extra spicy\" did not deliver the scorching hot flavor I was expecting and would not make for a decent food challenge. The other two flavors were just mediocre, nothing special. We had also ordered calamari, but they are extremely salty. The sweet potato and Cajun fries are cooked to a superb crispiness. Ask for corn and potatoes to be cooked with your seafood.\n\nYet again I could not resist the temptation and ordered a Blue Moon to go along with the meal. I might be completely out of the loop, but it has been a while since I have seen a restaurant offer beers for less than $5.50 a bottle. Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon are the beers they offer for $3.\n\nI cannot stress enough that you should get there before 6 because the wait is nonexistent. For a party of six, half of us being present, they sat us right away. Yet if another large party came and our group was not all there we would have to give up our table.

            "review": "Went here for a late lunch after finding a four star, casual, place on Yelp with over 500 reviews and two $$ rating,  my kind of place...\n\nI can't help but compare it to the Boiling Crab in LA since everything about it is virtually the same, even the sweet potato fries, and the half corn on the cob in the bag.  But for those of you who aren't familiar with the Boiling Crab chain, it a crab boil in a pouch too with only one minor difference that mattered to me:  here they offer etouffee instead of gumbo, and I think I prefer Boiling Crab's gumbo over HNJC's etouffee...\n\nThe other difference between the two is that there isn't this insane wait to get in like the Boiling Crab always seems to have, which is great for HNJC.  The four of us ordered:\n\nSweet Potato Fries ($4.25):  these were long and slender deep fried sweet potatoes and came with ketchup on the side.   Ok, but I don't like sweet potatoes that much...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=9ouHMxvk3Ajz4FZsTNLJxQ\n\nChicken Wings Basket (5 pieces)  ($7.95):  these wings served on a bed of regular fries and come with ranch dressing and ketchup.  The wings were nice and lightly fried, very moist and juicy.  Good...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=IooJdoITYr8QFM_qBcVMSQ\n\n2 Etouffee plus 1 bowl of rice ($6.99 x2 plus $2):  the etouffee had a consistency like coarse oatmeal, had a little heat in it, and already had some rice in it.  Even with the rice already in it, it needed the additional rice to tame the spice which was more like a peppery heat than anything else.  I like gumbo more than etouffee, but even then, I had a really kick ass etouffee at a NY street food fair recently...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=k8YQoV8gLp64rbPXyY5rsw\n\n1 lb Crawfish ($9.99 lb):  had the Hot n Juicy Special seasoning without any additional spice level.  The flavor was definitely there, not too spicy which is the way I like it,  it's just that eating crawfish is too much work.  I usually choose shrimp because it's the best deal, the shell is light and easy to peel, so there is more meat to shell ratio.  We had two corn on the cobs in the bag and they were tasty as usual because they absorbed all of the flavor in the bag...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=Aa8X2cG2oAMY5kLgLzonxA\n\n1 lb Shrimp w/Lemon Pepper ($10.99 lb):\n1 lb Shrimp w/Garlic Butter ($10.99 lb);  I treat both of these the same since the spice level on both was mild.  Like I said above, I think shrimp is the best deal because you don't pay too much for the shell and you get a lot of meat...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=_Ja-CD62sFXd2EPpiEnU8A\n\nThe service was great, the girls who waited on us were attentive but not hovering...\n\nI would probably come back, but since I don't live close by that presents a problem..."

(haha kidding of course)\nThis is definitely a place to come by if you want to hang out with some friends and family, a very very casual place to eat.  As you know, it's going to get messy.  It was my first time in a place like this, and even me, who's a guy that likes to try new things, I still had to wear gloves when I was eating all the food.  You can choose to not wear gloves, but your hands will stink (especially if you order it hot and juicy, which is all the sauces mixed into one)\n\nEven on a wed night, there was about a 30 minute wait.  The waitstaff is all really cool.  Atmosphere is relaxed.  But eating the food is not as relaxing as the rest of the place.  We were sweating, the food can be very spicy if you want it to be, be careful!  I wouldn't come here on a first date either.  Ripping off shrimp heads awkwardly wearing gloves (or not) may be too much to handle for some people.  \n\nI would def come back, it's great place to have a bunch of food and get your seafood craving satisfied."

I definitely recommend getting the shrimp since it has more \"meat\" for the pound rather than all shell but if you're willing to spend the extra bucks for the other shelled fish. Why not? Any seasoning you get has so much flavor. Definitely get the \"Hot n Juicy\" flavor even without spice it's good. Lemon Pepper & Garlic Butter is delicious too. They also offer delicious calamari.  I'll definitely be back here over and over again."

I'm hesitant on such things myself, but once I managed to get past that, and get the meat out of the crawfish and muss it around in the amazing sauce, I was hooked.\n\nThe experience: it's a simple clean place.  You order some type of shellfish (crawfish, shrimp, crab), a type of sauce (I go with the hot & juicy special), and tell them what else you want thrown in... potatoes, corn, sausage (I recommend all three).  A few minutes later they bring out a big plastic bag filled with the goodies and they plop it on your table.  No plate, no utensils: just rip in and enjoy.  You're going to get messy, but they provide a bib and there's paper towel rolls at each table.  Make sure you do not neglect to get the sauce all over everything you put in your mouth.\n\nI recommend washing it down with an ice cold Blue Moon.\n\nThey do also have fish & chips, and some pretty great chicken wings, so you don't have to get messy to enjoy a meal here.  But then you're kind of missing out on what makes it special.\n\nI should mention that unless you like pain, you should order \"medium\".  Their \"spicy\" is truly hot, and not some watered down notion of \"spicy\".  My Korean relatives agree.  Their \"extra spicy\" is reserved only for the completely fearless.\n\nAlso, I recently have tried the Snow Crab -- very tasty and satisfying, with larger chunks of meat than you can get from a crawfish.  Good eating!\n\nAgain, if you're squeemish about this kind of thing, it might not be the place for you.  Also unlikely to go over well on a first date with it's enormous garlic content.  But it is unquestionably super delicious, and if you think you can handle it, you should definitely give it a shot."

It took forever for someone to take our order and so hard to flag down someone when we needed to get a server.\n\nWe order half a dozen oysters.  When it was brought out, the oysters looked like someone ate off it and not fresh. We tried to get a server over to point out the problem and that took 15 minutes and she told us to hold on and sent over a manager that took another 10 minutes.\nWe asked nicely if we could get a different batch and she said their all the same. So we politely asked to send the oysters back.  The manager said sorry can't do that. My friends and I said fine, we'll pay for it but we still like them to take the oysters away. \nLater, I guess the manager realize we weren't happy and it could effect their tips so she walked over and said she will give us half off the oysters.\nRidiculous!!! Such bad customer service.  When you go eat at restaurants and the food is not to your satisfaction you have the right to send it back right away and the managers should take the charge off your bill and ask if you would like to order something else. Not this place.  They were more concern with making money then the well being of their customers eating old oysters and could possibly get sick from it.\n\nWe will not return here again.  This place is just a mimic of Boiling Crab, the only difference is Boiling Crab has better flavoring and better service."

I heard great things about this place, but when it came down to tasting the food myself, the excitement suddenly stopped. I mean, the sauce was decent. However, my brothers complained that the sauce was too plain, and that their shrimp and crawfish were not drenched enough in sauce. Also, the sauce was surprisingly not as spicy as the server described it to be. I must say, I certainly did NOT like the sausages that I ordered. Worst sausages in my life. I seriously could not force it down for the life of me. It was also a no-go with the chicken nuggets for me. I recall cafeteria nuggets tasting better... \n\nService was a bit slow and unorganized. The place was pretty darn small too. Once the dinner rush started, many parties ended up huddled around the bathroom. Not very comfortable if you ask me. \n\nI think I might try the newer Hot n Juicy the next time I'm in town. My brothers raved about the newer location being better than the kickin krab (my absolute fav) back at home. Unfortunately, I went with the overall statistics of THIS place and paid the price: cranky brothers and an unsatisfied stomach."

The crab we ordered with only garlic butter. The crab was obviously low quality, probably on par with what you would find at the cheap buffets. It tasted like a mouthful of sea foam.

Then in November they got a C rating with the Health Department.\n\nIf you google the Vegas channel 13 news website for their segment called \"Dirty Dining\", you will find they had run an article on Hot N Juicy  Crawfish about many health district violations from about the time I wrote my reviews.  \n\nThe News channel aquired the records of the health inspection which were archived as PUBLIC records. They publish them as a community service. \n\n-----------\n\nI think it's commendable he fixed the problems listed on the report. Just like he fixed the problems I experienced when I had a bad time there. I admit I'm a little freaked out these problems were there when I was eating there but oh well. I never got sick!\n\nSo the final verdict is this:\n\n1) The food tasted great!\n\n2) They've kept their A rating since the 1 time downgrade to C in Nov 2009 by the health department. That's GOOD! They're most likely safe to eat at and you'll have a wonderful time! It's never happened again, and I believe people and habits can change.\n\n3) After reading their reviews, service still seems to be inconsistent, as the norm.\n\nIt's just my PERSONAL decision to not eat there any more because I can't get their past violations out of my head after reading the report, but that's just ME.\n\nI'm on the lookout for a new place to try when I have cravings for messy seafood. Any suggestions?"

[i forget the rest] and then choose what heat level you want your spice at.\n\nwe're rookies so we ordered what my friend michelle e ordered which was  a lb of shrimp and a lb of crawfish.. [we took head of the spice warning] and had mild spiced crawfish and medium spiced shrimp with a side of medium sauce.\n\nthe waitress was super friendly and very helpful.  when i asked her i was cracking the crawfish wrong.. or missing something \n\nwe put our bibs on and got to it! \n\nsides:  rice and cajun fries.  \n\nthe crawfish:  um, i was a little confused.  i realized late in the game that whatever i was looking for beneath the shell wasn't there, and that it was what it was.. which was nothing much.  so if your looking to find lots of meat?  it's not hiding under a crawfish shell.. BUT!  the juice was excellent!\n\nthe shrimp was VERY good.. succulent and full of juices.  surprisingly, either sauces were too hot for me... just REALLY garlic-y!  \n\nwe were prepared to order more... but this was perfect for the both of us.\n\nthe garlic... lasts ALLLL day.  gum.. bring lots of gum.  \nmouthwash even.  and drink something to keep the burps down."

We'd be the only ones in the restaurant and those days are long gone. \n \nPlain and simple, the food is good. We had Crawfish and shrimp with garlic butter- less than mild, 2 sides of rice... OK, I love garlic but there's an abundance of it in the food. If you're not a fan of garlic, you are NOT going to like this  particular sauce. \n\nThe taste and smell of the food is pretty strong, thanks to the massive amounts of garlic, you can smell like seafood and garlic for a couple days after you eat here... No matter how many times you shower, no matter how many times I tried to get rid of the smell, it just would not go away. So if you've got some where to be and the smell of garlic and seafood will not be so appealing to the people around you, I suggest to come back another day because, it's no joke, the smell STICKS for days :) \n\n(I'm doing laundry today, 2 days later and my purse and clothes still smell like garlic)"

Good for them (both the show and the restaurant!).  \n\nComing for CES I wanted to come back here.  Came on a Friday night and the place was packed.  Had to wait 30 minutes.  \n\nWhen they sat me down, the menu looked identical to what it was 2 years ago.  They told me because of the new opening of a 2nd Hot 'N Juicy in Washington (D.C. or state?) the shrimp was buy one and get one free.  Sure, why not?  So I ordered 1 lb of crawdad, 1 lb of crab legs and 1 lb of shrimp which turned into 2 lbs of shrimp.  \n\nGot the Hot 'N Juicy flavor which is a combination of all their flavors together.  You get four different flavors to choose from (check the website's menu) or you can just combine them all.  So I did this and asked for extra garlic.  And I emphasized a lot of garlic.  And I chose medium as to how spicy.  I remember the 1st time I went I ordered either the spicey or extra spicey and after 2 lbs of crawdad my mouth and innards were burning.  So I decided on medium this time.\n\nThe tables you sit down at are covered with a plastic sheet.  You get a bib to eat all your food with also.  The food comes out in a plastic bag that holds your food and the juice of whatever flavor you chose.  While eating your food, you crack and open whatever it is you're eating directly on the table.  After you're down, the waiters just come and wrap up the entire thing with that plastic sheet and voila!  A brand new clean table is ready.  I thought this was so cool the 1st time I came here so I made a complete mess of myself and the table.\n\nFood came out and I started to chow down.  There was a ton of garlic in my bags, it was outstanding.  They forgot my bib and half-way through my 1st bag I asked for my bib.  One of the waitresses actually tied it around my neck for me 'cause my hands were already all messy.  I laughed as she tied it for me!  That's service!\n\nFood was even better than I last remembered.  Shrimp was completely on point being moderate to big sized.  Choose snow crab for my legs and they were great.  And of course the crawdad was excellent.  After 4 lbs of food the spices got to me again.  Will have to go with mild sauce next time-sigh, I'm just getting old and can't quite handle my spicy foods like I use to.\n\nSo overall Hot 'N Juicy actually improved since I last came here-amazing.  A definite have to visit if you love crawdad."

We both took a nap and I turned on the TV. Then all sudden we realized MAN VS FOOD was being televised in Las Vegas. So it caught our attention. So being from Texas and having access to good NOLA type of food an cajun food. I was intrigued that this guy was at a local joint here off Spring Mountain Road ((KNOWN FOR ASIAN FOOD)) and thought to myself.. I gotta try that place out. So needless to say, we jumped in a taxi and headed over there. The minute you get there, your eyes start to water and you can smell the spice from 20 yard OUT from the front door. I knew at this point I was in love. Sorry sweetie, but there is room for more than one love in my life.. Its called food :) Though, we placed our name on the list and it took a while to sit us down. That was ok, I knew it would be a wait. Though, once we sat down and we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and an order of king crab! We were in love! Some of the best food! I cant say it was the best Ive ever had, but might tasty and I filled my stomach up with anything I saw on the table. Its completely messy though. So expect to leave with the smell of spice and seafood on your body for the next couple of days. Also expect to be drenched in a goooy saucey spice sauce all over your fingers! The food was served in huge bags with the food in them. You rip them apart and lay it all out on the trash bag covered table. It was a bliss for me. Everyone was really friendly and I really really enjoyed the food adn my experience. It was very affordable and I would come back for sure! Not to mention the blonde new jersey girl told us a story that the guy from MAN VS FOOD, got drunk and passed out in the back of her car. Wonder what else happened :) hehe jk.. regardless, if you are in the Las Vegas area, and you want to get something away from the strip and enjoy a good meal. make your self available to this awesome lil hole in the wall. You will not be let down!"

Thin plastic table covers and the big roll of paper towels on each table are a very smart way of handling the mess left behind after handling and eating their bags of food. Yes, bags. Crawfish and shrimp and crab are offered by the pound and everything is served in plastic bags with their own spice and butter. Ordering more is simple: the service is attentive and enthusiastic.\n\nMy highest rec is for the shrimp. They're huge and easy to peel. The crawfish are on the small side, and the crab are a lot of work for a little benefit. They do also have sausage, served cut in big pieces. I was lucky to visit with about a dozen people and no one had any complaints with anything they tried.\n\nOur table also looked like the remains of some Roman feast when we were done.

Hot N Juicy medium sauce is the perfect heat and flavor. There are other sauces but Hot N Juicy sauce is a combination of all sauces and just has a much better flavor than competitors sauce such as Boiling Crab.

I would have liked it more spicy, but wifey couldn't have handled it. next time we'll prob both get our own stuff. The seafood was super fresh and cooked to perfection. Messy, but super worth it. Def go if you want a cool no frills seafood experience. and make it spicy!!!"

There's either this place (that has other locations) or Boiling Crab...but we like it here better.  You order your seafood, pick your sauce, spice level, sides (if you want)...then get MESSY!  Soooo good!  I always get the shrimp with the spicy hot & juicy sauce.  Mmmm!  I also get an order of oysters.  I gotta have that cold clean oyster feel while eating spicy stuff.  And also because I just LOVE oysters.  =)  Rice is a must for me, oh and a side of extra sauce with lotttts of lemon.  I'm so hungry now.  Lol!"

Off of spring mountain, across from Vegas' chinatown is this super casual sport bar'ish spot.  We saw them on Man vs Food and we just HAD to try it.  Looked soooo good on tv!!!  And they didnt disappoint :)  Pick a seafood (Raw Oysters 1/2 Dozen/ Dozen, Dungeness Crab (Seasonal), Blue Crab (Seasonal), King Crab, Snow Crab Legs, Lobster, Clams, Shrimp, Crawfish) then pick a seasoning (Louisiana Style, Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, Hot N Juicy Special), how many lbs and pick how HOT you want it!!  This all comes out to you in huge clear plastic bags and you've got a nice roll of paper towels on the butcher paper covered table to keep yourself somewhat 'clean'.  Oh ya, take the bib and ask for gloves (we didnt know about the gloves....)\n\n*Hot and Juicy special crawfish (1lb HOT): my fave, savory hot and juicy.  Totally garlicky and enough spice to really plump up your lips.  You're sweating and maybe even getting a runny nose...but who cares...it's soooo good! Always dunk in the sauce before eating. YUM!\n*Garlic butter crawfish (1 lb HOT): even MORE garlic, really buttery and HOT.  I found this to be pretty salty too but fiance loved it.\n*Cajun shrimp (1lb HOT): really meaty, plump n juicy fresh shrimp.  once you peel be sure to dip the meat in the sauce...mmm\n*Sweet potato fries: super crisp (crispiest sweet potato fries i've ever had) altho the sweet potato flavor didnt seem as strong.  Great vehicle for MORE sauce! mmm also helps in putting out \"some\" of the fire going on in your mouth\n\nmmm crawfish....we really need this spot in nyc!!!"

They were out of stone & blue crab, leaving only king legs and snow crab to choose from.  I got the tiny sized snow crabs, my friend got the shrimp platter.  both were mostly fries.  this place would die a quick death in south texas or the bayou country.\n\npros: food came out really fast, miller lite by the bottle served really cold.\ncons: limited items available that night, say they serve beer & wine but wine was only sold by the bottle last night.  atmosphere gets a zero, we were packed in like sardines, forgive the pun. waitress seemed frazzled, maybe it was her first night.  had to ask for lemons, WTF?"

We ordered a lobster, a whole Dungeness crab, calamari for an appetizer and a couple of bowls of rice. It seemed like a lot at the time of ordering, but the food just wasn't filling.  I should of ordered shrimp or something else.\nThe calamari was The only thing I really enjoyed. It was ALL squid, no peppers, and it was light and crispy. \nThe flavor we requested in the lobster and crab was plain, and the waitress explained that the water used to boil it is flavored with seasoning. The flavor was fine, with a hint of old bay seasoning-esque. The crab was a bit overcooked and the lobster was not as tender as I wanted. \nFor $90, I think this place is overpriced and not that great when it comes to the quality of the seafood. The waitress should of checked up on us more and they should consider hiring a cleaning crew for their bathrooms."

Everyone is really friendly and as attentive as they can be for how busy they get. The wait is usually long af but this evening was the first time I've been sat in less than 10 minutes (jackpot!).\n\n\nSince the last time I was here, they've changed up the menu.  It used to be just seafood by weight, rice/taters/fries/corn, calamari, and now there's basket combos (chicken strips, shrimp, calamari, softshell crab) and po'boys (chicken, shrimp, softshell crab, etc) which I think is nice. One thing that sucks is every time I've been here, they have NEVER had blue crabs available. Because of that, I usually just get shrimp and I get two batches of shrimp - one with the hot n juicy sauce medium or spicy and one with the lemon pepper medium or spicy.\n\nHot n Juicy is just one of those places everyone in Vegas loves!"

Every time before have been just good but this time I really did enjoyed everything.\n\nThis is the original Hot n Juicy of Las Vegas and has always been legit except for the parking. Parking kinda sucks but that doesn't stop us or anyone else from coming. The atmosphere is great and service has gotten even better through out the years. That is all because they are staffed with fun young servers to hype the joint up which makes it a exciting experience. \n\nThe music is hip, there are TVs all around and they have plenty of seating for the amount of space they have. To keep the place cool from the hot Vegas weather they have tons of ceiling fans which really keeps the Resturant comfortable. The day we went was pretty chilly outside so inside it was actually pretty cold, good for the summer days but not that day. \n\nIf you are not a big crawfish person like myself not to worry they have other items on the menu like Chicken wings, shrimp, clam, calamari, catfish and nuggets with fries basket. There is also \u00e9touff\u00e9e which is like Jambalaya and it was really really good. The oysters we ordered was so good, fresh and juicy. The potatoes and corn that soak in the Cajun juice is always amazing and my favorite part of the bag. With the right amount of spice and the right amount of Cajun the shrimps was delicious. The craw fish wasn't bad as well I just don't care for them. The fried calamari was battered and seasoned just right and paired with their season fries it really hits the spot. \n\nDon't forget it's always fun to eat at a place where you are required to wear a big plastic bib and gloves to fully enjoy your food. Or maybe get a Polaroid taken to be put up on the walls to remember a bday celebration or just to say you've eaten at a place that was featured on Man vs Food.

The cab driver was a little confused too,  but he said this one was the one that he drops everyone off at. \n\nFirst off, the servers are very friendly. They might not have been very quick to get our food order or remember to bring everything, but they were all super nice. \n\nThere were 6 of us in the group and we decided to order by pairs. It's hard to not share and hard to share with the entire group. You'll see it gets really messy and there's no way of passing things around the table. So the easiest way to eat is to share with the person next to you or across from you. \n\nWe ordered the shrimp, crawfish (of course), clams, and king crab legs. You also get a choice of sauce and spiciness. Everyone ordered the hot n juicy sauce (a mix of 3 of the choices). I usually eat my Thai food 4 stars and ordered medium spiciness. It was pretty good for me, although I could have used a little more spice. It might be too spicy for people that don't eat hot foods. \n\nThe food comes out in bags and you just dig in with your hands. There's bibs and gloves for everyone (highly recommended). I loved the clams and shrimp. The crab legs didn't have much flavor. The crawfish were just a pain in the ass- a lot of work for nothing. I would probably skip that next time. In fact, everyone in our group was saying how great the food was- EXCEPT for the pain-in-the-ass crawfish :) \n\nI would highly recommend this place. The food is good, service is great, and the atmosphere is so much fun. And prices were not bad if you're used to the astronomical prices on the Strip."

I love eating really really spicy foods and the medium spiciness I ordered had just enough kick for me.  My friends ordered crab legs and crawfish marinated in the Hot n Juicy special but I think the shrimp is able to soak more of the delicious marinade and easier to peel.  Heck, I even ate the shrimp's head and I don't normally eat the shrimp's head =)  The marinade is that good!  I'll never be able to go back to Hawaii and eat expensive Giovanni's or any other shrimp trucks again.  Giovanni who?  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat there again!"

We live in a neighborhood of friends, and often get together on a Friday night and order something fun.  Many times it has been Hot and Juicy.  This week we ordered hot and juicy for pickup.  We ordered 13 lbs... 11 lbs of shrimp, and 2 lbs. of crawfish.  The shrimp were inedibly mushy when we got them home.  Luckily, I had defrosted a bunch of king crab legs an lobster tails from Costco.  This higher quality seafood saved the day, and the party.  We called hot and juicy the next day to see if they would refund the money for the shrimp, and that we would gladly bring back the mushy shrimp.  It took 4-5 calls and many hilarious conversations dealing with several of the 20-something children who seem to run the place. One girl said \"for the future, I would ask them to put no more than a lb. per bag.  The shrimp are fickle\"  Really, young child??  As if we are the ones who packed all of the shrimp in one bag!  I'm not at all convinced the amount per bad has any bearing, but she shed all responsibility, saying she doesn't have the authority to give a refund. After a few more calls with other little girls who had no authority, we finally got a hold of a manager, since the owner is apparently too important to deal with his customers.  He offered a 5% discount on our next order.  when we promised to write the story on Yelp, he upped it to 10%.  The problem is, I don't want disgusting mushy shrimp paste nastiness at any price.  The manager said \"I checked with the 'chef' (I'd call him a cook at best) and he said that they were cooked perfectly\".  Did he?  Hahaha!  Of course he said that. I have 10 people, one a sous chef at a restaurant in the Bellagio, who beg to differ.  The manager also practically accused us of lying when we told him we order from there often saying \"well, I don't see an order history on your card\". This, after we had already mentioned that a different person in our group of 10 picks up the food each time. Some of us pay cash.  This place is damned sure not worth the wait, and certainly not worth the exorbitant prices they charge.  They just lost a ton of business from all of us and everyone we know, and don't seem to care at all.  They simply don't stand behind their product at all, so why should we?  Order at your own risk!"

The prices weren't at all bad and they are pretty quick service-wise. Their sauce is spicy even for the mild, but still finger licking good! I would rather choose Boiling crab's sauce over Hot N Juicy's, but overall Hot N juicy's got my vote. Faster seating, quick service, good prices, and FREE water?? Yeah of course i'd pick Hot N Juicy! \n\nMy only complaint about this place is that they kind of over cook the shrimp so it makes it a little harder to peel off the shell."

Took my neighbor and her 13 yr old and my mother...we were prepared to get down and dirty...\n\nOur first impression was that on a Friday night, this place should have been much busier -- it almost made us nervous -- but we soldiered on.   \n\nThe four of us ordered 3 pounds of shrimp, a pound of crawfish and a half pound of sausage -- all with mild \"hot n juicy\" (which is all of their sauces combined).  Word to the wise, I was sort of bummed about ordering it mild, but we had a \"tendertongue\" with us... Maybe I'm out of fire breathing practice because we thought the mild - like others on yelp - was definitely hot enough.  First you have to peel the saucy shrimp or crawfish while it's hot out of the steamer -- but then you realize once things cool down to the touch that your tongue is still on fire.   \n\nWe ordered rolls -- and that was the fun part -- sopping up all the great sauce (since they don't use newspapers on the tables, this is possible...)\n\nWe thought the shrimp was definitely better than the crawfish.  They were out of dungeness and blue crabs tonight -- altho had snow crab but we were worried about the texture -- and honestly the shrimp were really good.\n\nThe 13 year old is a shrimp-oholic...We ended up ordering another pound for him and the cajun fries for us...really good crispy fries, too.  We girls all had beers -- perfect with the shrimp -- but honestly, once you start eating, you have to keep going -- because you're so slimed, you really can't stop and drink...I'd say we easily went through a roll of paper towels.  And they cleared us up before our 2nd round of shrimp and gave us a new plastic tablecloth and fresh drinks.  \n\nService was genuine -- a little flakey and not really clued into the real reason they were out of crab -- but...does that really matter?  \n\nBeware, it's very easy to miss if you're heading from the Strip westbound -- fortunately it's on the right hand side if you're heading west on Spring Mt before you reach Decatur.  Then the easiest way to get back to Henderson is to take Decatur back to the 215 -- another warning -- they're doing some crazy roadwork on Decatur headed south -- so be careful -- the road is badly marked, dark and nuts...\n\nWe'll definitely go back -- but this is not for the faint of heart, anyone who doesn't like to eat with their hands or has an aversion to plastic.  \n\nOur total bill came to $70 and change before tip.  but we had 4 pounds of shrimp (16 - 20s), 1/2 pound of sausage, 1 pound of crawfish, about a dozen rolls, 1 pc of corn and 1 potato, cajun fries, 5 beers and used up more wetnaps than I'm sure any table has ever before...so we thought it was completely fair.\n\n(Naturally, we stopped at Sheridan's frozen custard on the way home...)\n\nFun Friday!"

For great seafood, it is oh-so-worth it!  This style is new to the Chicago area, and I have a girlfriend who can't stop raving over how much better this one is than our Chicago options.\n\nBack on to food.\n\nOysters: we ordered a half dozen. Fresh, yum, cleaned well, good sized meat.\n\nSausage: a little spicy for my liking, but still good. I don't have too high a tolerance for too much salt.\n\nSnow crab legs: Fat and juicy. Good amount of meat. Good crack to the shell, indicating good freshness. The meat's own sweet flavor still shone through, despite the HNJ sauce we smothered it with love in.\n\nShrimp: also fat and juicy. fresh and plump, but i couldn't conquer for the life of me. Between 3 girls, we ordered 1lb of crab each, and split a half pound of shrimp.  Even then, too much for us, despite all of its hot and juicy glory.  it made me SOOOO appreciate that this spot supports a half pound of shrimp. Save that cash for the pricier proteins.\n\nextra bonuses: I love that they offered gloves, to keep that seafood smell away from under your nails. The gloves aren't great, and they really mess with your dexterity, but hey. If you've got a hot date, or an outing with friends, you don't want that seafood-smelly-give-away to follow you aruond all day.\n\nDefinitely becomin my gold standard. When in Vegas, I'll always have to find my way off the Strip to make it to this joint. It is definitely a go-to-gem that no foodie in Vegas should miss out on!"

            "review": "When I think of Hot n Juicy, my first thought is not crawfish. Probably more along the lines of Megan Fox, Denise Richards, or Megan Good. Crawfish has always been a tough food for me to try. It looks like a ghetto version of a lobster crossed with shrimp and for the longest time I have given it the nickname of \"Little Cockroach\". I always felt why would you eat a crawfish on purpose? It's like choosing ground beef when you can have steak. Shrimp has always been my favorite weapon of choose for any of these cajun \"Boiling Crab\" type places, because of the efficient flavor to value ratio. A Crawfish is usually about 9 to 10 bucks a pound and is about 60% shell and 40% meat (I will later find out 90% shell or greater and less than 10% meat). Trust me for a pound of crawfish. You will pay a handsome penny and will not have enough meat to make a crab salad or even an appetizer with crackers. \n\nHow did you find out about Hot N Juicy Crawfish? How does it taste though?? How's the quality? Stop being negative! You might say.\n\nI am guilty of watching Man Vs Food like the majority of all the yelp reviews for this restaurant. Normally, MVF's track record has been fairly poor, but this is different! Who doesn't like Asian flavors crossed with Cajun style? That's like saying you don't like Amerie (so hot!) or Hines Ward (not as hot). I ordered 1 lb Shrimp and 1lb of Crawfish to give Crawfish a try and have my shrimp as a back up, both Hot n Juicy style. \n\nThe shrimp was great of course, although it was slightly under cooked. I think that's because maybe no one ever orders shrimp. It was a nice big size almost Jumbo shrimp sized and it tasted pretty good with the Hot N Juicy sauce, but nothing to jump out of your seat over. Shrimp is a dollar more than crawfish, but its worth it, because it is 95% meat and 5% shell. Time for my first taste of crawfish! At first, I honestly did not know how to eat it. I tried using my shrimp peeling skills, but I looked like a squirrel trying to get a nut. I finally swallowed my pride and asked one of the pretty waitress to help show me how to suck head. Get your mind out the gutter!!! Ha ha.. but that's how you are suppose to eat crawfish. You first suck the head, that's what she said (that's what she said) then you eat the meat. Hmmm.. Good thing this review is PG. The flavor of the juicy coming from the crawfish was a lot better than the shrimp! The taste is very delicious. It's like sipping a hot bowl of pho and some zesty tomato based Italian dish. Maybe that's a bad analogy. Let's say the restaurant smelled and tasted like a cross between a Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant and a Cajun grill. \n\nIf you look around the restaurant you will see nothing, but people with smiles on their faces. This is unusually, because most restaurants I go to most people look impatient or serious. This is definitely a plus! My rating might be a tad bit harsh, but I feel it is truly honest. I do recommend that you give Hot N Juicy a try, only if you get there early and don't mind driving in to \"Chinatown\" (didn't see many Chinese places mostly Vietnamese restaurants, but all Asians look a like right? Don't answer that). If you are from Orange County and are spoiled by the Boiling Crab and other restaurants like it, be warned you may not like this place. There is less spicy and a little less flavor. If you are a Asian Cajun newbie, this will be a great start for you. I will go back again with my friends that have watched Man Vs Food, but I'm not a fan of great head with no meat, no pun intended."

I had heard that it was casual, not too expensive for seafood and had an interesting approach to service.\nWe went there Monday night for dinner with our boy, Sean, who was visiting from So. Cal. We found the restaurant on the sleazy edge of Chinatown in a small strip center next to a Chinese massage parlor and a karaoke bar. Didn't look to special on the outside but even out in the parking lot, we could smell the garlic in the air.\n\nWe went in and it was equally unimpressive inside but we were greeted pleasantly and seated quickly by the window under the neon light....ah, ambiance. The table was covered with a thin plastic tablecloth and contained only a roll of paper towels. The slender menu listed a variety of shellfish, crab, shrimp and, of course, crayfish, all of which are ordered by the pound. Side orders were limited and included mostly corn on the cob, rice and french fries or potato.\nWe ordered the crayfish with Cajun sauce, shrimp with lemon-pepper sauce and blue crab with the garlic sauce. You can order any sauce from mild to paralyzing spicy. We went with mild which turned out to be pretty spicy on its own accord.\n\nThe food comes out piping hot, almost too hot to touch; dropped unceremoniously on the table all tied up in a plastic bags with all that sauce. You open the bag and dig in with your hands...no tableware of any kind except for a cracker for the crab.\n\nAs to the quality of the food...delicious...hot and juicy. All the sauces were fabulous. The crayfish is something we'd not order again, although it was fun to eat. You have to be a real 'crayfishianado' to suck the juice out of the heads like some do (we won't). So that leaves you with the tail which contains about a  \" piece of meat that took more work than it was worth to get to. The shrimp (head, shell and tail intact) were fabulous. Twist the head off, peel the shell and eat to your hearts content. We also tried a fried dish...breaded soft shell crab which was served with french fries...also delicious.\n\nIf you are looking to take people out to an impressive 'Vegas-style' food event, this is definitely not your place. But, if you want an inexpensive place with wonderful seafood, and don't mind getting your hands a little dirty, then I highly recommend it. It would be a blast to go to with friends who are laid-back and have a good sense of humor."

In Dallas we too have a Boiling Crab and I think this place is even better.  \n\nPS to all the people commenting how they wish there was a Hot N Juicy in Cali... there are a 2 there.\n\nBack to the LV location.  It's pretty standard straight forward food. Order how many pounds of seafood you want, order which sauce, and what spicy level. I usually go with shrimp over the namesake crawfish (I just think its better eats), a pound if it's just me. Add 1/2 dozen sausage, the special sauce which I believe to be all the sauces combined. I usually do spicy however this last time I did extra spicy mainly because my waitress misheard me but it was fine and still just as delicious.  Add a couple of beers and maybe some oysters and you have a meal fit for a king, a messy king, but a king none the less.\n\nPSS don't be afraid to wear the bib. It's all good. everyone does it."

Yes, I know there are other establishments in town that involve eating seafood with your bare hands, but these are the only two I've been to so far, and that is where my judgment stands. \n\nI never quite understood the hype of these kinds of joints when I heard all of my friends talking about it. After all, why would I PAY to do more work? I'm the type of person that just wants to eat. However, after eating here a few times, I can see what the hype is about. It's the experience. \n\nIt's fun, really. If you haven't tried it yet, those are the only words I can describe it. I'm not too good with my spices, but the butter garlic baby spice hit it right on the dot for me. SOO good. \n\nMy table order the King Crab, shrimp, crawfish, and oysters. The oysters they gave were all decent in size and I didn't feel like I was being ripped off with my money. \n\nThe legs of the crab were quite big, tasted juicy, but was definitely hard to open, even with the cracker. \n\nI feel like the crawfish could be skipped just because they're so tiny. Not just for this place, but crawfish in general. Unless, you extremely love the taste of prawns, it's more work than what it's worth. But that's just me. \n\nAs for the shrimp, it was the big winner here. \n\nMy only big gripe is the table we were seated at. We were a group of 5 seated at a table meant strictly for 4 people, and it was definitely uncomfortable having such a tiny eating are to split between us. After all, we did order a lot of food. At times, it also felt like the servers were rushing us with the way they kept checking over us towards the later half. It didn't sit too well with some of my acquaintances."

Crawfish - Lots of work, but fun to eat.\n1 lb. Clams - These were actually pretty disappointing. Also, seemed to be more empty shells than clams.\n1 lb. Shrimp - OMG....I'm not a big shrimp fan, but I ate so many of these.\n\nWe went back Monday with two other friends and ordered:\n\nFried Shrimp - These were ok, but the batter was a bit too thick.\nCajun Fries - Still had a kick to it.\n2 lb.

Clams - Yeah, I would stay away from these as they are not worth it.\n7 Garlic Butter Corn - These were so good. We ordered 4 first and we ended up ordering an additional 3. Must try these!\n\nWe ordered mild for all of it and it does make your tongue and lips burn, but seems to fade away by the time you leave. I am definitely going to go CRAZY next time and try......medium! =)\n\nI thought the staff was awesome. There was a mix up and they ended up giving us 1 lb. snow crab on the house which most places wouldn't. Awesome!\n\nI also thought the prices to be very reasonable! \n\nCan't wait to go back!

It smells kind of gross if you aren't used to this sort of thing. The service was very good. Our waitress was helpful as we were on our maiden voyage. The service is the best part of the entire experience. \nIf you are with others and never had crawfish I would highly recommend to first order one pound then order more if you like them. It is an acquired taste and to tell you the truth I didn't like them. Especially sucking the juice from the head. Blah! I only tried the Special Sauce Mild and found it to actually be very good. I also had shrimp and it was more satisfying after all the work of peeling. Bigger reward at the end not like the tiny reward from crawfish. I was disappointed only because it looked so much better on TV. Would I go back? I highly doubt it as I couldn't get the smell out of my nose and breath for a coupe days. Wearing gloves makes it so hard to peel but saves on the stinkies. Maybe I needed to wash it down with a cold beer but in any case it only gets a 3Star because a 2Star wouldnt be reflective of the awesome service we had from our waitress. Waitress 5Star food was 2star.\n\nUPDATE: As funny as it might seem, I am wanting to go again, but staying away from the Crawfish. Have upped my rating because of the craving."

Yeah, that's way too much food. The fries had good flavour but to me, they just took up unnecessary tummy space. The oysters were small and scrawny but still had a nice, fresh taste. The shrimp on the other hand, was impressive. They were big and filled us up fast. We went with the spicy Hot N Juicy sauce, and we were all feeling a little burning around our lips.

Wasn't this place featured on one of the food network shows or something? Anyway, the servers were nice and informative. The reason why I say informative is because one of the servers thoroughly explained to us the concept of eating crawfish. When she was explaining, I was laughing in my head because shoot, I am a pro/master at eating this stuff! Not to brag but I worked at a crawfish restaurant before so yeaaa I think I am pretty familiar with this stuff haha! Nonetheless, it was still fun listening to her show us how to eat crawfish. Anyway, on to judging the food itself... The seasoning was very good! I thought it would be whatevers and nothing can compare to Boiling Crab's seasoning but the seasoning here comes close to Boiling Crab. If I'm ever in Vegas, I will stop by Hot N Juicy again. I wonder if the seasoning at the Hot N Juicy Crawfish in Fountain Valley taste similar to the one in Vegas..."

Get the crawfish, get the shrimp, get the crab, but whatever you do, get it in the special sauce.  There's something in that \"SPECIAL\" sauce that's indescribable but keeps me coming back week after week - could it be crack, could it be heroin?  I don't know, but I'm an addict for life.  If I ever become allergic to shellfish (knock on wood), my family have specific instructions to put me outta my misery.  Or, I'll just die eating at my favorite restaurant Hot N Juicy.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed; the wait is worth it.  Go before 6pm to avoid a looooong wait.  It's busy all days of the week.  Make sure to get the corn, some sausages and add a bowl of rice to catch all the juices as they run off your hands when cracking the crawfish, shrimp, and crab.  Squeeze the head juice into the rice for extra flavor.  Eat the rice last, yum!  Damn you Adam Richman for telling everyone about Las Vegas locals' best hole-in-the-wall seafood place.  I feel sorry for the tourists that do try Hot N Juicy and then go home craving it because it's so amazing - I'm lucky to be living here in LV so I can eat there whenever I want!!!

Since this place is usually packed, it's recommended that you call ahead for reservations. \n\nThe staff and service is very helpful in recommendations and attentiveness. They will refill your glasses of water when they get a chance, get more napkins whenever they come to your table with more orders, and make sure you order enough before the kitchen is closed. \n\nThe set up is simple: order seafood by the pound. You can choose the seasoning for your seafood (like Louisiana Style, Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, Hot N Juicy Special) as well as the spice level. Then, the food is served in clear plastic bags and all you need to do is rip it open and dig in. You can make a mess on the table and not worry about the clean up. It's messy, it's fun, and it's delicious. \n\nBesides seafood, you could order sides like their Cajun fries or rolls to soak up the flavorful broth or sauce that is used to cook the seafood. \n\nFast, fun, and filling, Hot N Juicy Crawfish is the best place for people who want a feast of fresh seafood without the worry of cooking or cleaning up."

Hot'n'Juicy is one of them (why reinvent the wheel?).\n\nThis is how I think Hot'n'Juicy Crawfish Gentlemans Club stacks up against the original Boiling Crab in CA and TX.\n\nCONS:\n1. \"It's too much work eating crawfish\", so instead you'll get these huge monstrous crawfish that amount to about 12 in a bag vs. the 50-60 at BC.\n2. The flavors?? They just didn't blend as well as BC's, and the crawfish just wasn't immersed long enough in the mixture to absorb any of the flavors. What you get, is some bland crawfish.\n3. Even though BC has a slightly cheesy interior, I still love BC by far. You just can't beat their original locations signs in the men's bathroom which read: \"players with shorter bats should stand closer to home plate\" or \"why are you looking up here, when the joke is in your hands\".\n4. The waitstaff and service at BC has always been fairly attentive and friendly no matter how busy it gets. HJC's was straightforward and rather distant.\n\nPRO'S:\n1. Basically the menu was the same basic menu as BC, so it did make ordering really easy.\n2. No wait times! BC usually always has a minimum of a 1 hour wait time for dinner. HJC wasn't too busy for a Tuesday night.\n3. The freshness of the dungeness crab was REALLY GOOD at HJC. Probably the best I've had almost anywhere... where are they getting it from!?!?\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\nAlways imitated, never duplicated! Boiling Crab definitely reigns supreme, and I highly doubt I'd go back to Hot'n'Juicy unless they start to offer lap dances."

I haven't had crawfish in like 20 years when I lived in Mississippi and I totally forgot how to even crack one open. So as soon as I got there I was ready to order some yummy crawfish. I chose the 2lb bag seasoned in garlic sauce with mild spiciness. Oh it was so good. My hands got so messy, but it was all worth it. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice, very open and spacious. It was not busy at all and the servers were polite and friendly as well. I would definitely go back to satisfy my crawfish cravings:)"

A must try for anybody that enjoys seafood and is hanging out in Vegas.  The restaurant is located near LV Chinatown, off the strip on Spring Mountain Road.  It gets really busy in the evening, so I would recommend making reservations before hand.  My group of eight had to wait 45 minutes for a table (but since we were all pretty buzzed it went by extremely fast, lol).\n\nThe d\u00e9cor inside is very nice; definitely makes you hungry and impatient for the seafood.  The smell of hot, juicy crawfish is mixed in the air... I could not wait much longer to sink my mouth into them!  We ordered three pounds of crawfish (each pound including a potato), calamari, and Cajun fries.  The crawfish wasn't too expensive (under $15 a pound), and when they arrived in bags, we were ready to chow down.  I took my first bite of spicy crawfish, and BAM!!  Juices flowed into my mouth, and I was in crawfish heaven!  Everything was delicious!!\n\nThe crawfish pieces were decent (I mean, they don't have a lot of meat on them anyway), but once you start crunching on its shell, the juices come right out and that itself is so tasty.  I definitely plan on coming back here in the future.\n\nValet parking is not available and is limited, but there is a grocery center across the street where you can park and walk over."

I was curious about lousiana style which now I'm thinkin is plain....? My friend got the hot & juicy special. For both of us it was lacking, we like our food drenched with flavorful sauce. If ur a dry food kinda person you'll probably like it. I thought the shrimps were good... had leftover seafood taste tho.\nWe actually liked our corn it was pretty sweet. I order a side of extra sauce which could have saved the whole situation except it had this weird plastic taste in it.\n\nThe service was good. They were attentive.  \n\nOverall. It was ok.

I also like that you dont leave the restaurant smelling like youve just eaten HnJ. The other location on Spring Mountain - if i eat there and leave to go meet my friends a couple hours later...they can tell what I had for lunch due to the smell seeping out my pores haha The bathroom is always clean as well with plenty of soap! After eating, I always have to go and wash my hands, and the soap always being there is a plus.\n\nFor the food, \nThe crab is usually on point for me. It is cooked all the way through. There was ONE time where my crab was still cold, but the waitress immediately apologized and made it on the house. I usually get the garlic butter flavor, because you can never go wrong with tons and tons of garlic!!! The hot n juicy flavor is good as well. I also sometimes vary with a pound of shrimp or a dozen oysters. The shrimp is pretty big, so if youre not that hungry, you should get half a pound. The oysters are always yummy and I have yet to get a scrawny puny one. Their cajun fries are also very delicious - crispy and ful of flavor. I have not eaten the crawfish, but I hear its good. I feel like its too much trouble to go through ALL THAT peeling for a tiny piece of meat. \n\nYou can always ask for lemons and limes with salt/pepper fo rmore flavoring or to wash your hands with after. I like to grab some lemon sliced and rub them all over my hands to take away the smell and dirtiness. You can also ask for bibs to avoid splatter damage. \n\nAll in all, I prefer this place over boiling crab even though some people claim they taste the same. I would definitely come pay this place a visit ."

When we first walked in, I kind of got a bad vibe from the guy who greeted us first. Actually it wasn't a greeting, he just said to where ever. It wasn't what he said, because they say that to everyone, but it was how he said it,. So I was like oh no, will I enjoy what we are about to eat. The waitress that took our order was friendly and smiled a lot, so I felt a little better. We ordered the Hot n' Spicy,extra spicy, which is basically all the sauces combined and the Garlic Butter, medium, for our crawfish. It was actually pretty tasty. The flavor was good and not overpowering. The group that ate the spicy didn't think it was spicy enough and the group that ate the medium thought that it was a little too spicy. Go figure. At first we thought they switched our order, but we ordered some more extra spicy and they still thought that it was not spicy enough. We order the Garlic butter medium crab and the crab was cooked well, not overcooked at all. We also ordered Cajun fires, which were ok. Nothing to brag about.

We were smart enough to put our name on the list then check out the \"new\" location....yup, even looongger wait!  Lame. So we went back to the original location and waited just 15 minutes!

We ordered the catfish basket, king crab legs (juicy cajun- mild) and the pound of shrimp (hot & juicy- medium) and corn on the cob. \n\nFirst off, if you don't want to do a little work for your food, don't come here. You have to crack the crabs, peel the shrimp, etc. Second, it is messy, but that is part of the fun. We wore the plastic bibs, we went through a roll of napkins and we still had sauce everywhere and we put all the shells right on the garbage bag wrapped table.  \n\nWe both personally enjoyed the juicy cajun sauce on the crab just a little more then the hot & juicy we had on the shrimp. I think it would have been better for us to order mild, because the medium was still really spicy. We liked the catfish, but we took the breading off and dipped it in our cajun sauce. It was really good that way! The fries that came with the catfish were so-so, nothing to write home about. The king crab was a little over $20 for two legs. I would have liked a little more of that, it didn't seem like a whole pound to me but man was it good. I had to have my boyfriend crack it for me though cause king crab legs will stab you repeatedly in the hands if you suck at cracking them. \n\nI have never eaten anything with the head still attached (well at least not that I can recall). I thought it would bother me, but when the shrimp came, I just tore that sucker apart and dug in. Well worth the work, I must say.  The corn was delicious as well. Yum. Overall, a great place and lots of fun. I would really recommend it!!"

But there's really nothing better than tearing into some crab with your friends while drinking a beer. \n\nWe started off with the calamari, it was tough and chewy. The battering was great, but the calamari itself tastes terrible and had a bad consistency. I think they have some of the best fried shrimp in Vegas! Great taste and ask to have some hot n juicy spicy on the side for dipping the shrimp and everything else! \n\nThe snow crab and shrimp were by far the star of the show for me. The shrimp was soooooo good. Firm and delicious, and much easier to peel open than the ones I've had a the other Cajun spots in Vegas. The snow crab was huge and really amazing in flavor. Full of meat and easy to crack open. I asked for a second order of snow crab with no sauce because I loved the taste of the crab and liked to dip it myself into a side of sauce. Don't forget to order corn and potato in the bag!\n\nOverall, this has to be my favorite Cajun spot in Vegas, by far! Great restaurant to come to with the family and get messy!

Dang, it's getting busy in there and it's only going to get busier!  \n\nStarted off with two pounds of crawfish ($10.99/lb) of their Hot N Juicy Special seasoning with medium heat.  Easy to peel shells, juicy and flavorful crawfish, what's there not to love?\n\nInquired about the Dungeness crab, $17.99/lb.  They gave us a 1.7-pounder and it arrived whole in a bag.  Started off with the back legs and moved up to the claws.  The meat was sweet and the crab was fresh.  Deciding on how to move about the body, broke the head off and it was crab head heaven.  Loads and loads of crab fat/head etc. and so bad for our cholesterol!  But it was so good, really good.  We were scooping that stuff up and dipping it into the sauce.  Yum yum! \n\nFinally moving onto the body, broke it in half and dug into the lump meat.  Really sweet meat and just good stuff.  Nice treat from having only crawfish.  They did a last call as we were chowing on the crab, which was fine for us at the time.\n\nCome to today, a few hours earlier, the Husband looks at me and says \"I want to go back for more crawfish.\"  I realize that because we ordered only two pounds the other day, we just teased ourselves.  (We're used to two pounds each.)  Then my brother calls and asks for the address of this place.  Is he in town...no, this weekend he will be with his boys.  Uh, if you're gonna go, we'll probably want to go with you too so let us know...\n\nYeah, we like it that much.  Our cholesterol numbers aren't looking too good at this point."

It was alright... satisfying, but definitely not the best I've ever had.  The crawfish were pretty small, and when they're small like that you have to work harder to get to the actual meat, which kinda sucked since the meat was super duper small.  The crab was really good, and I really liked the sausages, but I remember them being pretty expensive.  I think we paid an extra $6 to get six slices of andouille sausage.  The corn is the neutralizer, which is necessary if you can't handle the heat.    The cajun fries were so-so, our next trip we will do w/out them.

Which brings me to...THE FOOD!\n\nI suggest tightening that bib across your neck because once that food comes out, get ready to lick those juices around your fingers slowly running down the side of your hands because it's going to get a bit messy!\n\nSweet potato fries: The perfect balance between sweet and salty. Fries came in a basket and had the right amount of juicy flavor, not dry but not drenched in oil either. A great way to start the beginning of the feast.\n\n3 lbs of Hot N Juicy Special Crawfish and 1 lb of Shrimp: Better than expected! Crawfish come steamed in a bag drenched in their special sauce. Full of flavor and deliciousness! The heads don't come with too much juice, but crawfish meat come exceptionally hefty, as do the shrimp.

I was safe from vampires the whole weekend. Thank you hot n juicy, but no thanks. My garlic scent caused Jeremiah (the dude who sang birthday sex) to not show up at Chateau Paris Night Club that night. It was a sad day.  Ok, I exaggerate a little, but yeah I was a little overwhelmed with how much garlic is in it (and I love garlic). Nonetheless, the crawfish was succulent and fingers licking.

Not just eat the meat, but the brains/roes. For real! The corn was delicious after it absorbed all the flavor and it was so juicy!\n\nFried shrimp great, so was the catfish. I'm not sure what batter they use, but it's amazing. Nice and crusty and oh sooo full of flavor! I like how the shrimp was butterflied open, and the catfish was so juicy inside. Not overdone at all. Complaint was the cajun fries...not enough cajun seasoning. \n\nI'm definitely having more cravings....I want some NOW! Will they deliver to CA? That would be GREAT!"

We had stopped at another \"crawfish\" place nearby and there was litterally no one in the place.  That was the first clue that we didn't want to stay.  Then we did a quick Yelp and the average rating was 2.5 stars.\n\nWhile Yelping the first restaurant we saw this place with an average of 4 stars.  Much better, so we headed on over.\n\nLike I said, the first time we've had crawfish. \n\nThe first big plus, we were greeted and sat quickly.  The server asked if we had ever had crawfish before, and when we said \"no\", he brougt out two crawfish and showed us the process.\n\nWe ordered crawfish and crab legs.  Both were great, but beware, the \"mild\" sauce has quite a kick to it.  We also ordered calamari and sweet potato fries.  Everything was good.\n\nNow, this is NOT A FIRST DATE PLACE.  But if you can find someone that will go here and  get dirty with you on the first date...marry them. :-)  Half of the fun is you eat your shell fish and just toss the shells on the table.  In fact, it's so messy, they give you a bib and plastic gloves(upon request).\n\nThis place is fun, good food, decent prices and just worth the visit if you haven't had crawfish before, or just want to eat some good ol' Southern crawfish, crab(blue, snow, dungenous) and catfish."

I go to eat out alone more than others because of my work schedule and manage to enjoy it because it's a treat to not have to cook, to have someone wait on you  making sure you're happy and last but not least you leave without having to clean any dishes. Well if you're expecting to leave here satisfied and happy think again!!!! By the time I was walking to my car I felt like I shouldn't try any new places for a few months, then I realized I wouldn't like anyone else to leave with a stomachache and headache like I did so I had to come online and review with details.\n \nExactly what happened: After I ordered I was left to be ignored like if I was paying with Monopoly money. Apparently  my \"waitress\" seems to have had a limited energy source and giving me good customer service would've drained her too much. So when I needed limes, more salt&pepper etc.. I had to ask the waitress closest to my table. If that wasn't bad enough my fried fish tasted like it was fried with old oil and the fries were tasteless because I was hungry I just tried to eat it and not complain. Then came the crab legs and although I specifically told the waitress I didn't want them to be spicy, she said I had to choose one strength of spicy and that baby spice was very light. Well light it was not, it was spicy, my lips were burning and my stomach felt punched with just one little piece of crab leg. If it had not been for another young lady that stepped up and asked what was wrong and how could she make it better I would've left feeling worse. They took the crab legs off the table and tab so I paid immediately. Left a cash tip to the girl that was nice and made sure to leave a handwritten note on the credit card auth to the other. Hopefully the manager sees it and provides better service training.\n\n That's as much as my queasy stomach allows me to write. Good luck!!"

I was a little thrown off at first, because there's a disposable tablecloth right in front of you and they throw down a plastic bag of crawfish/shrimp/whatever, laden with sauce and a corn/potato/whatever thrown inside. And you just kind of dig in! Crawfish itself is kind of hard to eat, or difficult, since you go through sooo much work and the result doesn't really yield much. I'm much more of a shrimp kinda girl, but the sauce and all that licking made it worthwhile. \n\nThis place is great, would come back again. My only complaint is (that since I'm such an environmentalist) they throw EVERYTHING away, from cups to plates to forks. I mean, i get it, it's easy clean up and all. But the poor environment!

He was very polite, patient, and knowledgeable. Once our drinks were delivered, we had a new server, Natali. After she took our orders, our experience quickly became negative, as our food orders were all mixed up and half the food came out much later than the rest. Natali was kind enough to take off 2 items off our bill that took over an hour to arrive. We were already in a rush to catch a show, and we decided to settle up as quickly as possible. \n\nWhen Natali delivered the bill, there were items that were added that weren't ordered. We had to explain that these extra charges were in fact not ours. She brought a new bill out, without explaining the automatic 17%  gratuity that was added. Because of the amount of time spent waiting for food, we decided to settle using 1 visa card, and worried about splitting the charges within the group afterwards since we were out of time.\n\nDue to the rush, we tipped an extra $50 on top of the automatic gratuity, which was NOT deserved. While signing the receipt at the cashier, Natali should of mentioned that tip was already included. We understand that we should've spent a bit more time reading over the bill, but with 8 people rushing to catch a show, we weren't fully able to analyze the receipt. \n\nWe let Noemy Avalos know of this matter, and she not only decided to give back the $50, but she offered to refund the entire tip $100+ back. Amazing manager, and a pleasure to talk with.\n\nWe will return, when we come back to Vegas for EDC 2014. :)"

You can also choose the type of spice you'd like. They have more than just cajun if you aren't looking for spicy (Lemon Pepper, etc). I had a pound of the shrimp, Cajun style. I got the medium spicy level because I wasn't sure, but it was nothing. I wish I got the most spicy. I also had the oysters on the half shell. The prices are reasonable and nothing beats well cooked seafood and lots of it!"

The crawfish was good but super duper exceptionally bodaciously spicy.  You order the crawfish by the pound and it was $9.99 a pound and get to choose the seasoning sauce.  The specialty here is the hot and spicy, which you then get to choose mild, medium or hot.  Let me tell you, even if you can eat really spicy food, choose mild because it's going to so burn going in and coming out!  I can usually handle spicy food very well but found the mild here to be really hot.  The garlic in the hot and spicy sauce really came through and made the crawfish really really good!  In fact I think this place is even better than the crawfish boil restaurants that I've been to in both New Orleans and Houston. \n\nWe came here on a Thursday night and found it to be about half full which was to our surprise because we had heard it can be at least a 30-40 minute on weeknights and longer on weekends.  I guess we just lucked out.  3% discount if you pay in cash.  The total for the two of us came to $41 dollars with tax and tip; this included 2 pounds of crawfish, sweet potato fries, beer, rice and extra corn and potato.  \n\nAwesomeness is achieved here and this time man won, at least until his visit with the porcelain goddess later in the evening!"

For those of you who crave garlic, Hot N' Juicy Crawfish is your mecca, you should make your pilgrimage.  \n\nThis place is all about one thing, and that is the food.  Generally speaking, you will not use plates or silverware here, just your hands.  The small paper menu features a few items, which can be ordered in a variety of styles.  Tables are topped with a roll of paper towels, and a garbage bag as a table cloth.  Normally I balk at the idea of wearing a gimmicky bib at a restaurant, but when your server brings you a bib, PUT IT ON.  This meal is a hot n' juicy mess.  \n\nLast night we had a pound of the king crab legs cooked \"Hot N' Juicy special\" style (think chinatown meets the bayou, or Mulan meets The Frog Princess if you're a Disney fanatic)  We also had a pound of crawfish the same way.  \n\nThe King Crab Legs ($20 a lb. right now) were huge, meaty, and succulent.  The meat eagerly came out of the shell, as if it was waiting all day for me to eat it. \n\nWe also ordered a pound of the crawfish.  The only issue I had with these tiny dancers was that they're typically out of season this time of year.  The ones brought to the table were small, like the size of a medium shrimp.  They were tasty, but it is a lot of work for what amounts to a mento-sized morsel of meat. \n\nBe ready to emanate garlic from your pores for a few hours after the meal, but its totally worth the aroma.  This is a great alternative date spot, since it is messy, casual, and reasonably priced.  \n\nMessy + Casual + Reasonably priced = Delicious Fun!"

Prior to going to Las Vegas I Googled Cajun restaurants and found one that had great reviews.  While in Vegas I mentioned to someone the restaurant I found and going to try and was told to try Hot N Juicy Crawfish instead. \n\nThe aroma of the seafood made our mouths water walking in.  We waited 20 minutes or so for a table.  We ordered a combo dinner that included 1lb crawfish, 1lb shrimp, Andouille sausage, potatoes, and corn on the cob.  My husband likes heat so he chose the Hot N Juicy Special Seasoning and the Extra Spicy spice level. \n\nWe also ordered 1lb of shrimp with Louisiana Style seasoning and the Mild Spice level, which had a nice flavorful kick to it.  We also had another pound of shrimp with the Juicy Cajun Seasoning and the medium spice level which was flavorful but definitely hot. They serve everything in separate bags per the seasoning and spice level.  The tables are covered with a throw away plastic cover which is where the heads and shells are tossed.\n\nWe loved the atmosphere, food, and super friendly staff.  The only small negative thing to mention is that the shrimp were hard to peel and a few mushy which usually means the shrimp is not the freshest.  Didn't effect the taste though!  Happy to read they are opening one in the Planet Hollywood Casino on the strip.  We will definitely go back!!"

Then my fiance's cousin said something about Hot-n-Juicy and it somehow just stuck in my head. So yea,, Patrick and I in Vegas, properly buzzed and ready to throw down on some good sea bugs. Let's activate the Lyft and get a ride to Hot-n-Juicy heaven.\n\nWe walk in and we were immediately greeted, \"Welcome to Hot-n-Juicy!\"\n\n\"Table for two please.\"\n\nShe smiles, takes a couple of bibs and menus, \"Right this way please.\"\n\nWe told her that it was our first time here and she told us the popular items,, crawfish and shrimp is their main draw. Their Hot-n-Juicy flavor is their most popular and we can choose from mild, medium and hot.\n\nOk, so a pound of shrimp, a pound of crawfish and an order of the dungeness crab. All hot-n-juicy, all hot spicy. The shrimp and crawfish arrives first. We start with the shrimp which was properly done. Not too rare and not too over cooked that it sticks to the shell. Just perfect, and the sauce a perfect combination. Then comes the crawfish, which was pretty much the best crawfish I have ever had so far. My gosh, their house sauce is just to die for. The crawfish is just the perfect vessel for all the garlicky spicy goodness. Then the dungeness crab comes... man oh man is it good. If you don't know how to properly eat a whole crab,,, please learn, you're missing out on this. If not,, then please don't even enter this place,,, just go back to your hotel and order room service. Get yourself chicken fingers and friend potato sticks,, trust me,, you'll have a wonderful time with that instead.\n\nWe had an AWESOME experience here. We even ordered an extra pound of crawfish because it was that freakin good. Next time I'm in town for some good seafood YAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS moments to enter my mouth.

I felt like such a newbie trying to open the crawfish, I splashed myself a couple times, but that's what the bibs are for, right? The flavoring was great; we ordered medium & it was just enough for me. My nose was running a little & my eyes got watery, but I enjoyed it. I think next time I'll stick with crab legs cause I definitely have that down to a science ;) The cajun fries were straaight up cajun! I'd have to stop myself after a while because it would get a little spicy. Soft shell crab was good, just wanted marinara sauce from the calamari instead of the tartar that the soft shell came with :) The calamari was house made, but it wasn't anything fancy for me. There's only a few places where I can say that's GREAT calamari. \n\nThe service was average, it was a Sunday & the Lakers were playing Orlando so we had to wait for a good 20 minutes for a table for two. I didn't realize that the restrooms were in two different spots, but our table was against the wall for the mens restroom & I was washing my hands before & after we ate. My bad fellerz!\n\nThe weird thing is that at the bottom of the receipt says you get a 3% discount if you pay cash.. I don't get it, do you have to present the check with the cash, then get a new receipt with the new balance? They already use enough disposable stuff & use styrofoam cups so I don't really think they're going green anyway. Blah, maybe I'm going crazy because I'm yelping & it's already 6am!! Random.. and awkward receipt though. I will be back Hot N Juicy! The simplicity of the menu & your system is definitely working, so much props.

I still hear good reviews from family members and friends who just got back from there recently this year. This place is the reason I became obsessed with those little critters. There were pics of celebrities on the wall who also ate here. NICE!  The environment is decent looking and the service was good and acceptable. There's always plenty of paper towels around and bathrooms are clean. Anyone who hasn't tried it should give it a try. It's worth every penny. Come on now... it has to be that good to make it on the food channel and travel channel. I think man vs food made the right choice. Boiling crab just isn't buttery and hot enough for a  challenge. \n\nBelow is a little  review comparison between Hot n Juicy special sauce vs boiling crab whole sha-bang sauce. I've been to boiling crab about 8 times now in SJ and 1 time in anaheim and it is so far  the best in CA. I usually order 6 lbs.  I read some reviews here from others who had tried Hot N Juicy crawfish and I have to completely disagree with them calling this place a duplicate or copy cat of boiling crab. They should go get their taste buds checked. Hot N Juicy is 5x buttery/stickier and a bit sweeter but they do have xtra spicy as an option. Their sauce will leave your fingers smelling for days that's how good it is.  Boiling crab on the other hand has that smokey taste and their spice is acceptable. I normally order xtra spice.  What happens in vegas stays in vegas except for the smell it follows you home. Hot n juicy crawfish still remains #1 as my favorite place. 5+ stars from me for their awesome delicious foods.Boiling crab is right behind it unless Red Crawfish in SF can knock it to 3rd place. Red crawfish will be my next stop."

We ordered the hot n juicy mild seasoning on the crawfish, shrimp, and crab legs and it was delicious. Mild was a bit spicy so I wouldn't go spicier than that."

Scared to try the hot! French fries dipped in the sauce are heavenly. The worst part--you have to go home and shower and do laundry, the garlic and spice is so strong I can smell it in my clothes and hair. Nonetheless it's totally worth it!! I love this restaurant."

I had been researching for weeks prior to my arrival and this place was at the top of my list.\n\nWhen you 1st pull up you realize its a small place but I was hoping for the best. Upon walking in we were greeted and told it would be about a 20 min wait but we were able to order some beers to sip on while we waited so that was a major plus! \n\nWe ordered the lobster, snow crab legs, shrimp, && king crab legs! Oh ma gawd it was to die for. We got our spicy but it was a perfect spice not over bearing! The kids even loved them! \n\nService was decent; if I had any complaints itd be that they ran out of the shell crushing thing (not sure what its called but if u eat seafood its the metal thing u use to open to open up ur lobster) but other than that the food was awesome the price is about right. We paid $160+ for a party of 7 (including 4 rounds of beer)\n\nHighly recommend it! We will be back again and again"

My favorite was the lemon pepper and the hot n juicy was a very close second. I would pass on the ragin cajun next time. We also ordered corn, which soaked up all the delicious flavor. I always have to have corn at these crawfish joints. \n\nI know the place is called hot n juicy CRAWFISH and a lot of people love crawfish...but it is a lot of work for a very small pay-off. Because of that, I think shrimp is the best way to go!! I love peeling the shell off and then dipping the shrimp meat back into the juice. \n\nFor the Bay Area people, this place is a lot better than that other crawfish place in Oakland and maybe at the same level (or better) as the uber-popular one in San Jose. I might even rank it higher than the place in San Jose because the sauce doesn't seem as buttery and artery-clogging. \n\nCan't wait to go back!"

Hot n Juicy is on my list of places to take out of towners.  It's sits right next to Nora's and Fierfly in my book for something, different, excting, deliciuous, fun, and affordable. It is always packed! We went Monday night at 8:30 and still had to park across the street and wait 30 minutes to be seated.  But, it's worth it.  \n\nThe funny thing is, I don't even eat the crawfish. I go for the crab! The shrimp and clams are also very good.  This place is really great because you can personalize your selction.  Pick your seafood, pick your sauce, pick your level of spice.  NOTE: They are not kidding around here - SPICY MEANS SPICY.  They put all your grub in a plastic bag and serve it to you tied in a knot.  You can have them add corn, or potatoes insode as well.  I stick to 1 lb. of crab hot n juicy special medium.  I like to get corn on the cob thrown in there, plus order some sausage on the side. Rolls are a must to soak up the rest of that garlic butter infused seafood juice.\n\nThe service isn't that great but isn't that always the case for the best grub.  \n\nStrap on your bib, and get ready for your lips to burn, your nose to run, and your beer to slip out of your galicky hands."

In a nutshell...she loved this place !!!  DO NOT wEAR YOUR SUNDAY BEST TO THIS PLACE !!  Yes, they give you a big roll of paper towels on the table....yes they give you that tacky lobster bib ( USE IT...YOU'RE NOT TO COOL ) \nshe ordered a pound of the crawfish w/ house special sauce ( basically all the other sauces combined ) extra spicy.....i ordered the shrimp and sausage with medium sauce ( yeah,...i admit...i'm a wimp ! )  before getting the food my SO kept yakking about some city in china ( it may have been shanghai ...can't remember ) that there is a street of restaurants that only serve spicy crawfish ...she loves the stuff....she can be picky  about the food and how it's served - i was pleased she did not have attitude when her food came out in a plastic bag - no plates, forks, etc...just a bag of food...she put down a paper towel and she went to town...every now and then she would say...\"so good\"  or \"yummy-yummy\"  but for the most part just  kept working on those lil buggers...her cheeks getting redder and redder due to the heat...she was in heaven...we ordered another poiund...she ate that...she was still hungry....she is not a big eater....we ordered 2 pounds to go\n\nOverall, it is a fun place...next time we will try the crab...btw...the shrimp were very good, lots of butter and garlic...i asked the server if they served bread ( they don't ) i wanted a roll to slop up the sauce at the bottom of the bag !!\n\na little pricey - total bill was $66...and we were still hungry ( but we did have an extra 2 pound bag ...SO ate that the next day for lunch )\n\nwe need places like this in the vegas valley !!!  Variety is the spice of life\n\nUPDATE - 2ND VISIT -  tried the blue crab....SO loved it...too much work for me... after one crab, i went back to the shrimp - i was pleased to see they listen to their customers - they added the option of buying rice and also rolls....they also had a special - $2.50 coronas and heinekens....again, maybe a little pricey but this place is all good !\n\nUPDATE 3RD VISIT ----  they've added king crab legs to the menu ...$20.95 / pound ....i guess i'm an elitist ...my only complaint about the KCL ...they don't cut them in 1/2 ....very tasty ! SO did her usual - 2 lbs of crawfish at the restaurant, 2 pounds to go - she thought this was the freshest batch of crawfish she's had in our 5 visits to H&J !"

I said no I wanted fresh fries. It took about 20 minutes for me to get new fries. I was paranoid after that the staff might spit in my food, but really what else could I do.

We arrived by taxi which was no problem and got seated immediately.  I looked at all of the bibs and thought that this surely would make me pass out with no problem.  I did the best I could, I told our waiter that I needed cokes and any drink with caffeine.  I decided NOT to order the crawfish and went ahead and ordered the shrimp.  My sister went ahead and got the crawfish daggonit and a side of fries.  \n\nIt all started really good, I felt alive,  I doubled up on my gloves and I felt like I could get past this 'tiredness' like I used to in college just push on through it.  I even got a crawfish from our 1 pound bag and thought - this is no big deal.  Handful of fries - gone. Broke off the heads of the shrimp (yes, they have the heads on) and threw them back in the bag and kept eating.  I then came up for air and then it hit - that coma, that feeling that takes over you as you realize you might have had a little too much and not only that you're 3 hours behind your NORMAL time.  Then i gave up.  To make matters even worse we walked outside and got punched in the face due to the heat.  We had a great time there and the service and food was great.\n\nJust a note to those who did NOT rent a car and taxi their way through Vegas -- Taxi's are NOT frequent here so call ahead about 30 minutes before you leave.\n\n4 Stars."

My standards are pretty high for crawfish and this place delivered! \n\nThey have so many flavors and spice levels to choose from ! We got the 2 lbs of crawfish with the Hot & Juicy Special flavor with no spice. I know that sounds lame, but trust me, the \"no spice\" is still plenty hot. The mild is more like a medium and medium = HOT. Be careful when you order here people! The waitress steered us to the \"no spice\" and I'm very thankful she did. They were perfect. \n\nWe also got 1 lb of the snow crab. The snow crab were some of the best I've had in Las Vegas. Absolutely no comparison to the snow crab you get on the buffet lines ! \n\nSoo the biggest con about this place is its' hella EXPENSIVE! I honestly could throw down 4-5 lbs of crawfish in one sitting but at $9.99 a freaking lb I couldn't justify spending $50 on dinner when I could get a steak at the nicest steak restaurant in Vegas for that price. I guess I'm spoiled coming from TX and New Orleans where crawfish over $5 a lb is considered highway robbery!! My mom died when I told her I spent $9.99 on crawfish. I know we're in the desert so we have to pay a premium for everything, but geez...

Definitely better than salty Boiling Crab but just a tad behind our local Ray's Crab. We had 2lbs of shrimp, 2bls of clams, sweet potato fries, and rice. I liked their clams the best; tender and delightful. Big plus on their servers that could definitely strike up some conversation. \n\nWhat I like the most is that their hot is hot and not watered down. Its definitely a tingling sensation in my palette that is delightful and pleasing. I am pretty sure their spicy could be a workout. \n\nWe will probably be back if we desire hot cajun seafood and we are in Vegas."

            "review": "Where do I begin? I am a little lost for words for this place. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of Boiling Crab, so I was looking forward to an improved experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish. Boy, was I wrong! Since I'm not a fan of peeling shrimps and breaking off the head, I decided to order calamari. I love calamari, so I was looking forward to them; specially after a four hour drive. Unfortunately, my taste buds went through an awful experience. The calamari looked pale, texture was soggy, and undercook! How in the world can you mess up something that goes in the fryer?! Second, the batter had no seasoning and it tasted plain. I was so disappointed, because I really wanted to like this place. However, our waitress was very accommodating and apologized; although, it wasn't her fault. The waitress offered to comp my food and asked if I wanted to order something different. I was very pleased with her customer service, but said no after getting something raw. I was afraid of food poisoning; specially, since I'm in Vegas. \n\nGreat customer service earned this place two stars and their fried shrimp. The fried shrimp tasted fresh and it was fried all the way. In my opinion, they serve better shrimp than Boiling Crab. As for the seasoning, it tasted the same, so don't expect to be wowed. My sister wasn't in the mood to eat seafood, so she ordered chicken nuggets with Cajun fries. The chicken nuggets are not fresh, but frozen, and they taste like they've been in their fridge for weeks. So, parents beware when you take your children to this restaurant. Also, if you're the type of person that likes to wait till everyone is served, your food will definitely get cold here. They don't bring all the entrees at the same time, but what ever comes out faster from the kitchen. I was the last one to be served, so you can only imagine how much I was looking forward to their calamari. Those of you who like different type of hot sauces for your oysters, they only carry Tabasco sauce. I wouldn't recommend this place, but you be the judge!"

I had to go and I am glad I did.\n\nWhen I arrived, there was no wait, my girlfriend and I were promptly seated. We ordered 2lbs of crawfish and a pound of shrimp, we added corn and potatoes to our mix (which are 50 cents a piece to add on). They have several different flavor profiles. We went with the Hot N Juicy Seasoning. It was heaven. It was spicy, savory, and garlicy.\n\nIn Louisiana when we have Crawdad boils, we throw down newspaper, here the tables were covered in plastic and they gave us bibs (which I need whenever I eat). \n\nThey will show you how to eat mudbugs if you have never had them, but I am a pro. They serve up large drinks in Styrofoam (which is so 1995), but they keep them filled.The seating isn't the most comfortable and the smell of place is in the air from like a mile away. After eating here, be sure to shower. You will smell like the fruit of the sea and garlic for like 2 days. It is totally worth it!\n\nI don't know if their prices are fixed, but 1 lb of Crawfish was $9.99, not bad at all."

Also, there's a place in Houston that I've been to that was voted top crawfish joint in the city that has a very similar concept.  That place was good so I had to check Hot and Juicy out.\n\nThe concept is brilliant - pick your seafood, pick your quantity and pick your seasoning (or just fry it).  No muss, no fuss.  Prices are relatively cheap and the food is tasty.  Our server was great and we really didn't wait long to be seated (maybe 5 minutes).  In that respect, I guess we were lucky with parking too, but I can see how it may be a cluster on other nights.\n\nMy one pet peeve is no full bar, but I'll live."

            "review": "If you've been to Boiling Crab or Red Claw in Orange County, CA, then you'll find this place is fairly comparable - though maybe with much better service.  But honestly, your opinion on which is better will be based entirely on your own specific tastes and what you're used to. (Ex: I was a big fan of Boiling Crab until I started going to Red Claw a few times and the garlicky taste grew on me. Now I love Red Claw and think Boiling Crab is a bit too salty. Some may think Red Claw is too garlicky.  So it all depends. Red Claw not ever having a wait is the biggest influence in my decision to always go to Red Claw now anyway.)  \n\nMy husband and I were in Vegas and were looking for a place to get good, inexpensive seafood.  Most buffets on the strip definitely don't cut it for me (since seafood is my favorite food), and their seafood is usually not fresh.\n\nSince I love Boiling Crab and Red Claw, I was very excited to find this place on Yelp and we made our way to the original location - as it's a bit more tucked away from the second location, which is a bit more touristy.  I found out later from our server that this location is generally more of a local's spot than the newer location.\n\nSo when we arrived at about 7:30 pm on a Thursday night, we were a bit sad there was no parking in the small lot. But thankfully a group of people left shortly after we circled the lot and nearby neighborhood for parking. We got in and were quickly greeted and told that the wait would be about 20 - 30 mins, though maybe quicker because they were cleaning up some tables.\n\nOkay, so while I was waiting, I noticed a few things. \n1. The mixture of people in the restaurant was extremely diverse.  I'm sure there were at least 10 different ethnicities there!  The age range was also very wide - from young to old.  This was a great sign, as I noticed EVERYONE in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their food - the food fit, apparently, for varying taste buds.\n2. It was pretty busy in there, but the servers were extremely friendly and were all helping each other throughout the restaurant. No server was strictly confined to only one section or certain tables or customers.  If you stopped any server, they happily got you what you needed. This was honestly rare to see, and I was impressed at how the servers all seemed to interact together as a team rather than stressed out, competitive individuals.\n\nAs far as the food, we got our shrimp, sausage, and corn in the hot and spicy sauce at spicy level. The clams, we got in the spicy garlic sauce.\n\nShrimp - Mostly fresh, juicy, plump, easy to peel and crunchy (sings of freshness).\n\nClams - Were good, though the actual clams were a bit smaller than I hoped they would be. I guess maybe they just use different clams than what I'm used to at Red Claw.\n\nSausage - Were not polska kielbasa sausages as we hoped. :( My husband was very disappointed and didn't like them at all, and he normally loves sausages.  Don't get these. Even though I ate them, I didn't enjoy them.  They were pretty oily and fatty tasting in a bad way.\n\nHot N Juicy sauce - This is similar to Boiling Crab's sauce.  I would say the spicy is pretty spicy, and a little spicier would make it so that you couldn't taste your food very well.  My husband and I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food, and the spicy here is in between the medium and spicy spiciness at Boiling Crab.\n\nGarlic sauce - We got this sauce spicy, and it tasted fairly similar to the Cajun garlic sauce at Red Claw (though Red Claw uses tons of real chopped garlic and is much better, in my opinion).  My husband liked this sauce over the Hot N Juicy sauce, which is ironic since I'm usually more of the garlic lover.\n\nCajun fries - Fries sprinkled with Cajun seasoning.  The fries were good and crispy and moist on the inside.  The Cajun seasoning is pretty spicy, so be mindful of that if you don't like things too spicy.  They were good fries. :)\n\nOverall, this was definitely a great place for good Cajun-style seafood.   The service was great, and the food really good.  Overall, I'd definitely go here again the next time I'm in Vegas and craving seafood.\n\nBe warned though that your hair, skin, and clothes will smell like your food.  I suggest you keep jackets and sweaters in your car and wear something you don't mind stinking up.  You'll probably have to take a shower when you get home, unless you don't mind smelling the food on your hair and skin while sleeping. :)"

If this location gets to crazy-busy, there's another one a few blocks away.\n\nThey have oysters, mussels, crab legs, lobster, blue crab, clams, shrimps, and of course, crawfish.  With the exception of the lobster, you order shellfish by the pound.  You can pick the seasoning you want: cajun, Louisiana style, garlic butter, lemon pepper and hot n juicy.  Pick your spice level: less than mild, mild, medium, spicy extra spicy.  Pick your sides and appetizers.

I ordered the mild here last time and it was comparable to medium elsewhere. The baby spice definitely has a kick to it.\n\nThe food came out pretty quick, which is awesome because I was starving! The crawfish was very fresh! The size definitely differs but you usually get a pretty average size crawfish. I personally like to order shrimp and crawfish at the same time so I feel like I'm eating more meat without putting so much work into peeling them open! The shrimp was a little overcooked, I know this because the shell kept sticking onto the meat which made it a tad more difficult to peel. \n\nAfter we were done with our food, I actually ordered two more corns (in sauce of course) just because of how sweet and delicious they were. Definitely hit the spot.\n\nMy only downfall to my review is that they didn't offer to refill our drinks and we had to let the server know we would like a refill as we were paying for our check. In addition to that, no one really checked up on us and I felt like I didn't know which server was our designated server. \n\nMy suggestions would be to zone people out to ensure they are covering the guest in their zone with 100% customer service. \n\nHopefully the 4th times a charm!"

I remember seeing this on Man v. Food and passed by it a few times when we were in Vegas, but never really thought I'd stop by and eat. Since a friend of ours recommended it to us we decided to give it a try. No wait to be seated. Server kept coming by to check to see if we were ok even though it was getting busy... I'd give this place 5 stars. Great visit..."

The food was good and I didn't give Hot & Juicy a higher rating because half of the crawfish were so small it wan't worth the trouble to try to eat it and the waitress wasn't friendly or welcoming.   The shrimp was excellent but I don't think I'll order the crawfish again."

Later, i will regret, because I will have a dragon breath burping for the next few hours. It's totally worth it though. \n\nAll the seafood is sold by the pound, except for shrimp which you can get minimum of 1/2lb. \n\nDont forget to wear the plastic gloves provided. (if not, the sauce will linger in your fingers and you will be sniffing it for the next few hours). To avoid long lines, I usually go between 2 to 4pm for snack. \n\nFor the jetsetters: the crawfish and shrimp is TSA approved as carryon. I guess the sauce is not considered liquid. I've flown with Hot n Juicy for about 3 times with no problem. Make sure to triple bag these suckers or it will stink up your carryon very fast!!!"

The food was delicious! Probably one of the best raw oysters I've ever had! The spices used were out of this world! Just make sure to ask for mild if you can't handle spicy food.\n\nThe location was authentic, right on the edge of Las Vegas China town.

She shrugged and said many customers take the frozen.  \n\nDecided 1 lb of frozen and 1 lb of brown....this was the worst food I have ever tasted!!!!!!!!   So I told waiter to take back the frozen (only ate 2 pieces) because it was nasty and give me a lb of shrimp instead.\n\nShrimp sucked too!  and worst of all, i got charged 6.99 for the two pieces of crawfish I ate, which I almost gagged on.\n\nSo, I gave zero tip!

We also ordered 1/2 dozen of the sausage $2.50 and a bowl of Etouffee soup $6.79. The Etouffee soup is like a gumbo soup, but with seafood in it. Taste super good and MUST TRY! The shrimps and the sausage came in one plastic bag. The shrimps were yummy and juicy, but not spicy at all because we ordered it in mild. Next time we would try medium. The sausage wasn't very special, so we will skip it next time. \n\nThe service was great. The waiters were very polite and attentive. They refilled our soda three times.

We each had a pound of crawfish with the special, which is the mix of the various flavors.  We also got it on the \"medium hot\" side.  I like stuff hot, but I have heard they can really put the heat on, so I was a little concerned about ordering it straight up hot.  We also got some fried shrimp with french fries to share.\n\nThe crawfish is delicious, but you have to WORK to get them.  They have so little meat, I would recommend shelling quite a few before eating.  In subsequent trips, my wife has had the shrimp, which are of course much larger.  They have a much better pay off, but don't have the delicious heads to suck out like the crawfish do.\n\nI was surprised by how good the fried shrimp was.  It's probably the best I have had in the valley.  The coating was crunchy, but not overly thick or greasy.  And, they are large.  This was surprising and certainly welcome.  \n\nAll in all, HNJ lives up to its considerable hype after being featured on so many TV shows.  Give it a shot."

Hot N Juicy is a restaurant like no other.  \n\nA few fair warnings:  be prepared to wait for a table (I waited 35 minutes), if you are sensitive to the smell of garlic and/or fish - stay away, if you're from the Northwest and enjoy spending your time volunteering to help save the environment (just be prepared to see lots of styrofoam and plastic), and if you don't like peeling seafood and eating it with you hands while wearing a bib - go to Red Lobster.\n\nI ordered the one pound shrimp bag, hot n juicy style, medium spiciness - highly recommended!  Once I adopted a proper peeling technique, I began chomping away at the marinated shrimps.  One pound was plenty for me, and since I'm a slower peeler, my stomach filled up by the time I was done eating the bag.\n\nHaving previously lived on the Monterey Peninsula, I am picky when it comes to seafood (especially shrimp), so I was pleased with Hot N Juicy.  The shrimp was quite delicious!  \n\nI don't think this will be a weekly or monthly restaurant of choice for me, but I'll enjoy taking my friends here who haven't ever tried it before.  \n\nI had a side of fries too, but I think next time, I want to try the rice.  I think the seasoning and juices mixed with white rice would be yummy!\n\nNOTE: If you're not into the atmosphere of the restaurant, try carry-out!  It's definitely something you don't want to miss out on!"

I grew up in so cal where Boiling Crab reigns supreme, and after moving to Vegas I've had an empty void that needed filling.  I saw the Man vs Food episode and I've read the reviews before stepping in, So I came in excited, hungry and craving crawfish.   \n\nBetween the 3 of us this is what we ordered. dozen raw oysters, catfish basket, 2# shrimp hot n juicy special very spicy with corn and sausage, and 1# crawfish hot n juicy special medium spicy.\n\nThe only complaint about the service was that our raw oysters, which should have been the first thing to come out, showed up on the table last.\n\nRaw Oysters- accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemons, horse radish and tabasco.  I'm a big fan of oysters and these were decent in size (comparable to hama hama), but without any accompaniments they were very bland.  Oysters are suppose to taste like the sea, but these were washed so much they tasted watery and flavorless.  \n\nCatfish basket- breaded in a cornmeal crust served over a bed of french fries and accompanied by ketchup and tartar sauce.  Personally I'm not a big fan of cornmeal breading, but I can't really hold that against the establishment and their recipe.  Catfish was moist and flaky and had a hint of cayenne which perfected the \"Southern\" flavor.  I actually enjoyed this the most.  \n\nShrimp hot n juicy special very spicy-  We ordered this with corn and sausage, both of which were awesome.  the corn was sweet and complimented the spice well. the sausage was spicy and tender and added a bold meaty flavor to the sauce for the shrimp.  the \"hot n juicy special\" sauce isn't as flavorful as I expected, and the \"very spicy\" here is comparable to  \"medium spicy\" at Boiling Crab.  But the flavor was decent and the shrimp themselves were \"okay\".  Not the freshest shrimp I've ever had but they weren't rotten or anything, but what can you really expect in the middle of the desert? \n\nCrawfish hot n juicy special medium spicy-  I'm debating whether or not I should even review this item just because I should have known better than to order this when I already know that crawfish is out of season at this time.  Needless to say we received a previously frozen, bland, rubbery product.  So I'm just going to comment on the sauce, which was the same on the shrimp, but this had significantly less flavor.  Perhaps, more spicy=more flavor, or it could be that there wasn't sausage and corn in this bag to add to the flavor.  \n\nMaybe I'm being a bit unfair because I'm comparing this establishment to Boiling Crab.  However the food was decent and a better alternative to a lot of other restaurants I've been to in Vegas.  If I was asked to come here again, I would, but I don't see myself CRAVING Hot and Juicy Crawfish like I do for Boiling Crab.  I guess my best advice is if you're a Boiling Crab fan don't expect too much out of this place.  if you're just looking to satisfy a seafood craving this would be a good supplement while you're out in the middle of the desert."

So we yelped for the new Boiling Crab in Vegas, but stumbled across Hot N Juicy Crawfish so we decided to give it a try. GOOD CHOICE!! I am happy to report that this is my new favorite hot spicy cajun shrimp place to eat! There doesn't seem to be a line here to eat, which is good because I hate waiting for more than an hour for food. \n\nService is really good here. Our waitress explained everything and gave us her recommendations. And when your water is low they come and fill it rather quickly. The waiters and waitresses are usually walking around and asking how everything is. \n\nI think prices were a dollar more than BC but that's okay. Totally worth it. We usually order just 2lb of shrimp (I can't even eat half) and cajun fries to share. And we got the medium spicy hot n juicy special. \n\nThe shrimp: It's so good. It's better than the shrimp at BC because the shrimp here are more plump and drenched more in sauce! Sometimes at BC it's either you get small shrimp or not enough sauce. But here, it looked like everyone's bags came with lots of sauce and plump shrimps. I think that is a win.\n\nThe cajun fries: Hot spicy goodness in the mouth. I felt like my mouth was on fire just after a couple! I love spicy food so this was a win in my book. It doesn't look like they just sprinkle the cajun sauce on the fries, but it looks like they cook it while the fries are in the fryer because it is seriously explosion of cajun flavor in your mouth after one bite.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'm going to make a stop here. It's not near the strip so if you are visiting and staying on the strip, get a rental car or taxi it over to the \"chinatown\" of Vegas."

The reason why I give this review a 2.5 (rounded off) is simply because of their hot/spicy sauce that they saut\u00e9ed the crawfish in. If not for the sauce, I would have given this a 1. The crawfish itself was over cooked to the point where it broke apart when you try to peel it, similar to eating dead crawfish. The tails of the crawfish was bland due to the fact that they boil the crawfish with little seasonings to none at all, then they saut\u00e9ed it with their signature sauce. The sauce was very flavorful and I think that's what made it for me. The amount of crawfish oil they added was insane though! It was spicy, but the spiciness was due to the oil, not from the seasonings. Nonetheless, it was very unique and memorable."

Like everyone says, the shrimp is where it's at. You let that shrimp swim in their Hot N Juicy special sauce and you're in seafood heaven. Make sure you add some corn to that bag of shrimp. I love corn to begin with, but after it's been soaking in that sauce, it becomes absolutely amazing.\n\nBe ready to get down and dirty with your seafood at this place. Make sure to bring your appetite and leave your best clothes at home."

I ordered 7lbs of the live crawfish, garlic butter baby spice, with the sauce on the side.  Since have to drive back home I always try to bring ice with me to quickly cool down the crawfish so it won't keep cooking in transit, then I reheat ut when I get home; but, that day my stop at H n J was on a whim (hey when you have a craving you must obey!).  The manager (I'm so sorry I forgot your name ) was kind enough to bag up some ice for me to put on top of the crawfish bags!!!  To top it off, she packed the order in a box, put the ice in, the picked up the box told me to open the door and she took the box out to the car for me!  You can't ask for better customer care than that!!!!!  Thank to the wonderful servers and manager at Hot n Juicy!

I was a bit of a doubter at first since I came from Southern CA and was used to Boiling Crab (which has since made its way to the Las Vegas valley). I have yet to try the LV Boiling Crab, but I am a fan of Hot N Juicy. The sauce is a bit different than Boiling Crab, but has a lot of flavor and you can definitely enjoy it. My usual order consists of shrimp and Alaskan king crab legs in the Hot N Juicy special sauce (which is basically all the sauces combined together - extra garlic please!) at the spicy level. Note - extra spicy is really really hot, almost too hot to be enjoyable. \n\nI have also had their lobster tails and other crabs. I'm not a huge fan of crawfish since its a lot of work for a little meat, but a lot of other people enjoy it here. Be prepared for a messy meal as this is a eat with your hands kind of place since you have to peel most everything. Its usually fun to see who can make the biggest pile of shells!\n\nI've also had the deep fried soft shell crab with fries and the oysters - both are really good and the oysters were fresh. \n\nThis is definitely a place that I will frequent and also bring friends to from out of town. I will see how the new LV Boiling Crab compares, but for now, you can find me at Hot N Juicy!"

I deducted 1 star for the dozen raw (and runny) oysters we ordered that tasted gross and not fresh at all. So when you order try to stick to crawfish or else u would get a nasty old oyster taste in your mouth. The shrimp was meaty and juicy just perfectly done.

The same sauce was use for crawfish, was still good,  but since it was frozen,  the sauce didnt seep through the crawfish for flavor,  it was a little bland/taste of water after u defrost any seafood. But it was still good.  I can only imagine what the fresh ones will be like! And the frozen crawfish were also cheaper.  Service was fast and food was good.

You're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. You order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready. \n\nThough you can get baskets of fried shrimp, crab legs, raw oysters, wings and chicken nuggets, Hot N Juicy Crawfish put their signature item right in their name. When you order the crawfish, there's a method. No \"crawfish Nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. You order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. For seasoning, you pick from Louisiana Style, Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper or a Hot N Juicy Special. Spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" That's not what they call it, that's what I called it. If you like spicy, you love this stuff.\n\nThe best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. Wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!"

On a weekday the place was pretty steady, the server were working as a team as well as the manager all of them went to our table to ask how we were. Water is constantly being filled. Food is pretty good, piping hot as a matter of fact that means it just came out fresh from the cooking pot. \nOrdered shrimps, clams and crabs legs, beer. For two people that's a lot of food. We did not left any shrimp unpeeled. That's how good it was. Over all food and customer service -two thumbs up and so glad we gave it another try. Equals = we will be a repeat customer."

That is the question! \n\nI am currently Team Hot & Juicy. \n\nMaking sure that I don't come here as often as I use to, allows me to look forward to coming back. The garlic smell that lingers for about 24 hours on your mouth and nails tend to steer me away from coming. But other than that, this place is amazing. \n\nThe flavors just pop in my mouth, I love it. I usually get shrimp hot & juicy medium. With a side of rice, Cajun fries, and extra butter. I usually get the sauce from the shrimp and put it in the butter and use that as an extra dipping sauce. bomb! I can drink that spicy butter all day! It is very UNHEALTHY but hey, YOLO right? \n\nThe staff is pretty Attentive and with another location opening up its not as busy as it used to be before. This location does have limited parking space though which can cause some trouble for me. \n\nAnd for some reason their raspberry ice tea is amazing. It's probably just regular ol' raspberry ice tea you usually get everywhere but I think with all the spices, the raspberry ice tea just compliments everything lol!"

So, what happens when you're in vegas for a bachelor's party for a few days? We ended up at Hot N Juicy. We were seated soon. But as we sat there, the dinner rush hour started to near and the line has gotten long. There was even a waiting list. We ordered 2 lb of crawfish with extra corn and lobster. \nThe crawfish was good. But it was alot of work for such little meat. The lobster was a little more expensive but it was so worth it. There was so much meat, we didn't have to spend too much time getting to the succulent meat. The dinner rolls came to us warm. Too bad it took 2 bites and it was gone. \nEven though it was good, but being spoiled by my regular spot in Portland, Oregon, I really can't say it's THAT good as My Brother's Crawfish."

This place doesn't even come close to BC, and I'm not just referring to the food.  First of all, there's nothing hot n juicy about the food they serve!  The sauce is so boring!!! it lacks so much flavor and is freaking watery.  It seems like the shrimp was cooked, steamed, then tossed in the bag along with the sauce.  If this is how they do it, they're missing out on some major flavor absorption within the shrimp!  Not to compare it to boiling crab, but you can tell BC lets their shrimp stew in the sauce because every piece is saturated with it's yumminess.\n\nAnyway, that's all I've bothered trying here.  To make things worse their prices are a tad bit more expensive and definitely not worth paying for watered down shrimp in a bag.  Moreover, they do not use fine ground pepper!  Ugh, who wants to have big ass chunks of ground pepper on their shrimp??!! How hard is it to invest in FINE ground pepper??  Yes, it's that important and yes, it makes a difference in taste.\n\nAll food aside, the decor of this place sucks too!  They have these tacky posters of all this French stuff.. Why???!? of all places would you have these hanging at a restaurant that is totally irrelevant to the type of food being served?!  Also, I think the pictures of people on one side of the wall looks weird.  Whatever, I gave this place a try every time I  had my sporadic craving of BC (twice).  Will I try again?? I'll probably just wait til I'm back in the bay to satisfy my hunger because hot n juicy ain't hot or juicy enough for me.\n\nBtw. Service is just alright.  Nothing major and nothing to make note of.  Oh, and if you pay with cash I believe you get 10% off your check."

Guess I need to work on becoming a novice here! Anyways, this location is always busy, and expect a bit of a wait every time you come (larger parties are always going to be an hour of more).

We ordered both the crawfish and shrimp with the Hot N Juicy special sauce which is supposed to be a combination of all of the sauces - the crawfish came out with that sauce and luckily they made a mistake and our shrimp came out with just the garlic butter sauce.  I was not feeling the Hot N Juicy sauce - it tasted weird with the garlic butter, lemon pepper and whatever else was in there, it was just too much. The garlic butter that was on the shrimp was really good though, we got medium spice and there were some nice chunks of garlic which is my favorite part :) Both the shrimp and crawfish were big - no tiny suckers here which I did appreciate because when you get a tiny crawfish it's quite annoying - all that work for nothing. My favorite part is always the corn because they sit it in the bag with the shrimp and it soaks up all the juice and every bite you get the sweet corn with the spicy garlic buttery taste - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I'll tell ya! I think if we never got the Hot N Juicy sauce I would have liked the crawfish better.\n\nThe service was okay - we got some jock looking like dude.  He was nice but we had asked for extra sauce and some extra corns - waited about 10 minutes, didn't see the guy and when we finally spotted him he was just kicking it behind the counter chatting it up with the girls. In my head I'm thinking \"COME ON FOOL!  I WANT MY CORN AND EXTRA SAUCE! WTF YOU TALKING FOR?! THAT WON'T GET YOU A GOOD TIP!\" haha.. we didn't end up getting our corn until the end of our meal along with the check - I guess we could just call that our dessert ;)\n\nThanks to MVF we came, we saw and we tried some pretty good food but I think if were in Vegas again we wouldn't come back."

It was good the last time I went, but it wasn't impressive that I was dying to go back. I was dreading a very ridiculous wait, but they said 20 minutes and it seemed like we got seated sooner than that. I guess in the recent year they've really ironed out their efficiency since our orders came swiftly was well.\n\nOrdered shrimp, crawfish, and clams in HNJ sauce, andouille sausage in hot butter, and one in lemon butter, half a dozen raw oysters, and rice. I've never been a fan of crawfish since it's a whole lot of shell for a little bitty nub of meat. The shrimp was big, juicy and perfectly cooked. The clams were pretty good but a few had a bit of sand still. I guess that's just a typical hazard with shells. After trying the sausages in other sauces, I still prefer the HNJ as my sauce- spicy and garlicky good. I was a tad miffed last time I came here with $2 rice being a piddly scoop- they made the serving bigger which they should. Asians rejoice!  My family liked this place so that's good. Sometimes being a Yelper everyone thinks you know ALL the things and I feel pressure being different in food taste too. \n\nService was great. Very friendly, checked on us often, fast about getting things. I really think the staff here has finally figured out a groove. Only helps them to faster turnover.\n\nOf course this is a messy experience, but if you don't like getting your hands all garlicky and seafood smelling, you can request gloves! My nephew wanted gloves so his hands don't smell. They give you bibs of course but this isn't the spot to wear something nice to and avoid long sleeves like white button downs. Cracking shells is a splatter hazard. \n\nYeah, this place is hyped to hell and I don't think is the greatest thing to happen to seafood like people make it out to be, but it is solid if you just want simple, fresh seafood. Sometimes clambake style food just hits that spot. If only it came with a sea view, I would feel complete."

We ordered 1lb of crawfish and 2lbs of dungeness crab. I love traveling west to get my dungeness fix!  We ordered both in the mild hot n juicy sauce.  Our waitress, Robin, told us the mild level wasn't spicy and only had a little kick.  For my newbie taste buds, it was quite the slap! The crawfish soaked up a lot more flavor and spices.  I'm not complaining, but for anyone REALLY averse to spiciness, you're in for a surprise! The dungeness on the other hand was perfection. I was licking the shell and all - that's how amazing it was. \n\nIn terms of service, the wait staff is nice, but forgetful.  I get it, they're busy! They won't lie to you if they forget to put in an order.  We found it to be a little charming.  I don't mind being vocal about what I want, so it wasn't a real problem for me.

I did notice that some Yelpers have mentioned seeing this place on Man Vs. Food. I guess I must have missed that episode, but I did see Adam's picture framed on the wall there!\n\nI ended up eating the shrimp, dungeness crab, and crawfish with mild garlic butter sauce. I usually order mild whenever I eat at Boat House or Boiling Crab, which is the perfect amount of spicy for me, but here at Hot N Juicy Crawfish, mild was a little too hot for me to handle. Our server did warn us that their food was a little bit spicier than other places, so I should have better prepared myself. It took a while for our party to finish the food because everyone's mouths were on fire, but we won the battle against the food, even if it was only mild!"

Parking can be hard and their might be a wait but it is worth the hassle. Take cash to get a percentage off your bill."

I would expect potatoes and corn to come with all the boils, but no, they are extra and charged per piece. The hot and hooky juicy flavor is a blend of all the flavors. The medium spice level was quite hot. The shrimp were large and cooked well. The crab legs were also a good size. They provided lemon, but you have to purchase dipping butter. This dinner is messy, so dress accordingly!"

However, I have never REALLY wanted to try Hot N Juicy Crawfish because I am kind of like a cat, LOL. I don't like messy eating and if I am going to go out and pay for my food, I prefer all the work to be done for me, if you know what I mean. \n\nThe in-laws were in town and have been wanting to eat here, so we finally came here for dinner the other night. We arrived at just the right time because there were a few tables still open and we were seated right away. 10 minutes later, the restaurant was full and many people were waiting outside. We had no luck with parking. The parking lot is very small and we had to park across the street. \n\nMy husband and the in-laws ordered a variety of seafood: blue crab, clams, shrimp crawfish, and catfish. \n\nTheir opinions:\n- the shrimp and catfish were the best\n- the crawfish required too much work for too little meat\n- the crab was very hard to take apart\n- \"mild\" was still pretty spicy\n\nI ordered the fried shrimp and sweet potato fries. I know, boring right? The fried shrimp wasn't very good. I think that the size was decent, but there was just too much breading on them. After eating 2 pieces, I didn't want anymore. The sweet potato fries were standard, nothing special. \n\nI'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I would come back again because I didn't enjoy it too much. However, I will give this place 4 starts because my family thought it was alright and had a good time. Service was friendly and attentive. We even had nice neighbors who showed us what they had ordered and commented on what tasted good.\n\nJust a few tips:\n- DO NOT wear nice clothing because juices will squirt everywhere and you will get dirty!\n-Remember to take a shower and do laundry ASAP because you will smell like the restaurant even after you leave! Skin, hair, clothes, everything!"

            "review": "First, a disclaimer: I moved here from Southern California and my parents still live in Orange County so I probably visit them and a crawfish joint there (Boiling Crab, Claws, etc...) at least every month.\n\nHot N Juicy has gotten better over the years with their service.  The waiters are very attentive now and you will never experience a crisis of tongue-on-fire and an-empty-drink-in-hand.  The service is consistent and commendable.\n\nHowever, what they improved in service, they still lack in taste.  Let me digress for a second: the spine of any seafood-in-a-bag formula is the sauce, something that resulted from Vietnamese people living in New Orleans, loving crawfish, Cajun spice, butter, garlic, and more garlic.  The Viet crawfish craze started in Houston, jumped to Westminster, and spread nationwide.  Hot N Juicy is the Las Vegas response to a community that contains a sizable Vietnamese population.  They caught their lucky break from appearing on the Travel Channel.  But they cannot be the representative for the Vietnamese Cajun crawfish subculture.  Which brings me back to sauce: Hot N Juicy's most popular sauce for any seafood in a bag is far behind.  Besides being too watery, it also contains too much garlic (yes, it's possible).  There is having enough garlic to highlight the flavor of the seafood (something Boiling Crab & Claws in Orange County do well) and there is suffocating the flavor with too much garlic.\n\nThere is one thing I love here, which are the sweet potato fries, fried to perfection with the right crisp.\n\nI'll go to Hot N Juicy if my Vegas friends crave it; but if it was up to me, I'd ask them to work on improving the sauce, like they have with the service."

That being said, next time I will be skipping the crawfish and opting for shrimp instead.  Crawfish are a TON of work for pretty much zero meat.  Yes you can suck the head, but it tastes like the murkiest part of the ocean and it's an unappealing, brown mushy substance (perhaps their tiny brain?).  Gross.  You order by the pound, and your meal comes with a boiled potato & corn on the cob.  They have calamari and other apps, as well as dinner rolls and rice.  The seasoning is where I give this place 4 stars.  You have your choice of seasonings (garlic butter, cajun, lemon pepper, etc)- the \"hot n juicy\" being a combination of them all.  You then choose from mild, med, spicy, and extra spicy (be forewarned that nothing is truly mild here).  You can choose from crawfish, shrimp, crab, etc. and all require work- but the shrimp yielded much more meat.  The sauce (I ordered medium) was heavenly- next time I will be opting for the shrimp and getting a side of rice to act as a vessel for this delicious fire sauce.  Definitely a simple concept, but lots of fun- especially w/ a group.  Oh- and be ready to wear a bib & get MESSY!"

I decided to take my fiancee for a never-before crawfish experience. \n\nWe were there on Tuesday night about 8:00PM and there was plenty of open seating. After we were seated, we were given the first-timer instruction on how to order. \n\nWe ordered 2lbs of crawfish(hot & juicy mild) included 1 potato & 1 corn, 1 lb of shrimp (galic butter mild), 1 soft shell crab basket include Cajun fries, and 2 cokes. We really wanted to order oysters but they ran out, that's why we ordered the shrimp. \n\nThe taste of the spices was very good, and garlic butter was wonderful. We both loved the seasoning very much. But there was one problem for us, we realized that we don't like crawfish. We never had crawfish before this night, at least not a properly prepared crawfish meal. We manage to finish all 2 lbs of it because the spices was just that good. On the other hand, the shrimp was so good, the large amount of garlic in that buttery sauce made the shrimp so sweet and tasty. We just can not stop eating the shrimp!!! And the soft shell? nothing worth mentioning, except for the Cajun fries we dipped and ate with the sauce in the crawfish/shrimp bags.\n\nThe whole experience was pretty good, the whole meal cost us $57 which I thought was a little high. We decided if we go back, we would order shrimp only and call to make sure they have oysters before we go again."

It has nothing to do with the establishment or reputation, so don't let that dissuade you.\n\nOut front, you see that it's in a strip mall and it's not a huge place. You go inside and it has the feel of a sports bar, but with a lot of families and bustle going on all around. Right away you see piles of napkins, bibs and seafood debris. No, it's not Aria, but that's what I like. People were comfortable eating with their hands, doing what needed to be done to get to their dinner locked in various shells and exoskeletons.\n\nService was the first and lasting thing I noticed. Someone sat me, and while I was deciding, 2 others came up to ask me if I was ready, what I may need, what to drink, etc. It was a tag team effort I appreciated. I have worked a lot of restaurants, and I know you have maybe 4-5 tables to take care of and honestly, 99% of servers don't give a shit about tables not in their section, \"they're not tipping ME,\" or if the the customer has a problem with them, it blows YOUR tip. But here, servers help every table they walk by. \n\nThere were people waiting to be seated and 2 large groups were less than half occupying their tables pushed together. The only problems I had in this is seeing the solution. Some restaurants have a policy of not seating large groups until they all arrive which is how the first should have been handled. With the campers at the other party, I have and seen other servers take a table as people from the large group leave to set it up for a new 2/4 top. \n\nThe tables are funny, the table cloth is plain white plastic and the napkins are rolls of paper towels. I find it comforting because they don't mess around, there is high volume picking and peeling going on here.\n\nThe menu is a simple piece of paper with most options listed on it and the spiciness of how you want it prepared. Aside from crawfish, there's shrimp, crab, much more. Damn, I can't find my copy of the menu they let me have... They also sell sides, so I got rice expecting some broth with my order. I ordered a medium spicy combo. I can talk about different types of spicy all day, scoville units, the whole thing. But this had a nice lingering spiciness to it. Drinking soda (acids) doesn't help extinguish spicy food, but I was being good because I had to drive. No, beer wouldn't have helped, either. It may help some people to bring antacid if they want to show off.  Ask them what the market rate prices are listed on the menu so you can compare, or don't get surprised.\n\nDinner was served, a server unceremoniously plopped a pound bag of crawfish on my table. Hahahaha. Rice came a few minutes later and I was already in my plastic bag. Crawfish is big in my family and I'm from the bay area. There is a LOT of work busting open the shells, sucking the heads and getting what little meat there is out. They had bibs and I opted to not get one, I thought I was a big shot. I didn't have a nutcracker either. You can tell some of the pros in the restaurant, they brought their own. But the shell was soft enough to bend and snap the claws (tip, snap towards the front of the bag, or rice bowl). The head can be scary to eat, there's cartilage and bits and things that I was used to having in a soup, hence the rice. It was a bed I let everything drip onto. People complain about how small they are, but you WANT that, the smaller ones growing have more flavor, just like peppers. You don't want a large or genetically engineered huge crawfish.\n\nThis is where it gets personal. To be honest with you, I haven't had crawdads in years since I worked at the Orleans buffet. But that was once and part of a larger meal. Before that, it was decades. I had a rush of all kinds of family situations and get togethers and people attacking crawdads. It's not like shrimp, there's a lot more savage carnivorous behavior in eating crawfish. I felt like I took the easy route with all the shrimp cocktail and larger crustaceans I've had in town.  And there were a lot more memories than I was prepared for.\n\nI made the mistake of reading some of the others reviews. Their complaints seem to be about places outside of the valley which I disregard. Everyone knows the south has better crawfish, \"...everything is trucked into Vegas.\" But IN the valley, there's nothing like it.\n\nI had about a quarter pound left to go for later, paid my tab. They have tee shirts there, which is nice. There's no greater advertisement I think than the local's place tee shirt. \"Everything okay?\" \"Everything was fine, just a little spicy, baby doll\" I lied. My eyes were red and teary from 25 years plus dormant memories."

It's exactly the way I like it.

We had a party of 8, ordered lots of things and just shared with the table. The service was friendly and attentive, the prices weren't bad, and the place was pretty clean inside even though both locations on this street are in raunchy strip malls, and this location has very little parking. \n\nCorn Fritters: hands down the best thing we had here \nCat fish: yummy corn meal battered and seasoned perfectly\nCalamari: lightly battered fried golden okay on the seasoning\nCajun Fries: a delicious smoldering fire in my mouth\nPlan Fries: Blah\nJuicy Cajun med spicy, and lemon pepper pounds of shrimp: okay very large juicy shrimp that were fresh, but they should marinate the shrimp in their many sauces or seasonings for a while before boiled or use more seasoning while boiling the sauce just didn't stick making the shrimp pretty bland. \nCorn: Pretty good balanced the shrimp, although my mother didn't like that they put her piece in the juicy Cajun sauce instead of on the side. (simple fix if we return she can ask for it on the side so no biggie)\nMozzarella sticks: okay nothing to write home about, jar marinara sauce  \nSausage: Good and spicy I enjoyed the slices that were in the juicy Cajun sauce with the shrimp\nSweet Potato Fries: I'm just not a fan of these but a few people at the table that are a fan said they were standard\n\nSo the reason this place has 3 stars: \n\n1. Food was just okay I've been to places just like this before with kicked up flavor with more menu options \n2. I don't drink soda and all they offer is soda and beer, no lemonade no iced tea (even though the website says they have iced tea, major fail for me)??? I was puzzled by this pretty much every restaurant I go to offers at least one non soda option\n3. The timing for their food is completely retarded our food came out at least 8 minutes apart from each other like they have one boiling pot and one fryer.. the shrimp came out first (not our appetizers?) then the calamari dinner then the appetizers, then after 10 more minutes the 3 catfish dinners so half the table was done eating when the last 3 meals came out once again major fail!"

I thought I would be getting the same quality since the owners are from Houston. Crawfish is not on par with anything from Houston or any part of Louisiana but since there are no alternatives in Vegas, I would have to say it's the best crawfish place (and I think the only one) in town. It is listed on The Best of Las Vegas but I've found that list to be a disappointment. \n\nI was disappointed that they charge extra for red potatoes and corn on the cob. All the other patrons seem to always be amazed at seeing crawfish and that we know how to peel them and suck the heads. This just adds to my impression that people are easily impressed and amused here. Prices are moderate but I still don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth due to the portion size. \n\nCrawfish is not really fresh due to the fact that we're in the Mohave Desert. I guess I just have a higher standard having had Crawfish in New Orleans and all over Louisiana countless times. Everyone else raves about this place I suppose because they have nothing to compare it to. I'm sure I'll be back when I have another crawfish jones but I just feel they could do better. \n\nIt's always blazing hot in the restaurant no matter what time of day I've been in there. I guess they are trying to save money? \n\nDon't have enough bathrooms."

We were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. We wanted to get stuffed with something Hot N Juicy. \n\nHot N Juicy is known for their seafood: crab (Dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. You pick the type of seasoning (Juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper or the Hot n Juicy Special) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). \n\nWe ordered 2 lbs of snow crab legs and 2 lbs of crawfish with Juicy Cajun at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red potatoes, etouffee (a Cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of sweet potato fries. Eating at Hot N Juicy is not an elegant refine affair. It's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. You open the bag and dig in.\n\nThe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. It was perfectly cooked. I found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. The meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. I found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where I could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. Also I got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because I sucked crawfish heads. After a while my lips got tingly and numb from the Cajun spices. \n\nI've never had crawfish whole before. I only had them de-shelled. While I love crawfish and the meat was great, I'll never have them whole like that again. The tail meat is rather tiny (I like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). At the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. Crawfish is mostly shell and I'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.\n\nEtouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. I liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. I thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.\n\nThe boiled red potatoes were much needed as a break from the relentless Cajun spice. They were nice and sweet. The corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty.\n\nThe final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. We gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. Happy ending for us indeed.\n\nWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you."

We reek of garlic and our lips are burning but our bellies are very, very happy.\n\nSometimes we order takeout and drive roundtrip from Henderson to get it.\n\nWe had the cajun-style crawfish this time, two pounds each - as well as the catfish.  We wanted the etoufee, but they were out.  Hubby said the next time we discuss going to Hush Puppies for catfish, remind him to go to Hot n' Juicy instead.  I got the medium spiciness and hubby got the spicy and we were both wincing at the heat.  The Blue Moon beer helped with that.\n\nI have to say that I prefer the shrimp to the crawfish - for the \"more meat\" argument that previous reviewers have noted.  I also like ordering sausage to add to the mix.\n\nI have yet to try the dungeness or blue crab, I guess I never go during the right season.\n\nI'd give this place a five if I hadn't had crawfish in Louisiana.

Wait, I think these 55 people have never tried crawfish anywhere else =/\n\nI actually can't say too much about the crawfish because I ordered a pound of shrimp.  Based on seasoning (which would have been the same with crawfish anyway), I'd say 3 stars.  My friend's pound of crawfish came with huge crawdaddies and my shrimp were pretty big, too so thumb's up for that!  I ordered the Hot n Juicy Special, which is probably all the others mixed together and was satisfied with my shrimp.  However, I ordered medium and it wasn't spicy at all.  I ordered half a dozen sausages with my shrimp and they were big pieces.  I also ordered a side of corn on the cob but they forgot it so I had to remind them.  When it came out, I took a bite and made the ugliest face ever.  I threw the rest away because it was bitter and drenched in too much seasoning (but I can't really complain about the second part).  I tried my friend's order of Cajun Fries (medium) and THOSE were spicy!  The fries came out crunchy and fat (skinny fat, not fat fat, if you know what I mean lol), which were yummy-o!\n\nI also tried my friend's deep fried soft shell crab and I don't think I'm a big fan of soft shell crab (I don't even love it in sushi rolls).  However, he enjoyed it.\n\nThe decor is much like any other crawfish restaurant, it was spacious and the setting was comfortable.  The service is mediocre; no smiling faces but they refilled my drink before I realized I even needed a refill!\n\nOverall, I like you Hot n Juicy.  You didn't disappoint me (but that may have been because I already knew nothing would ever beat Boiling Crab!)  I love that everything was BIG and that the seasoning didn't suck.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to try crawfish in every city you visit, you won't be disappointed but you won't come out thinking it's the best place in the world either."

The food was great, the servers were friendly, but when it came time to pay our bill, the manager refused to let our server split our bill into individual checks.  I have never seen a restaurant that refused to let a group split their bill.  Negotiating with the manager on the issue was like talking to a brick wall. There was no reasoning with her, just an explanation of a blanket policy that only so many cards were allowed per table.  It made me think they had some issue with paying credit card fees, and when we offered to pay the transaction percentage, the same blanket refusal to split the checks came back up.  After other members of our group tried to reason with her, she agreed to split the checks, but took so dramatically long to process each card that out of frustration one person in our group gave up and agreed to pay the whole amount.  That wasn't fair to him, and it was a bad way to do business.  I am going to write this off to an inexperienced manager who was trying to stand her ground behind a bad company policy she didn't fully understand, but regardless, it made for an unnecessary and unpleasant situation.  If you eat at this place, make sure everyone sits at their own table or be prepared to foot the bill."

Anyways....\n\nI ate here with 5 other associates in mid-March 2016. I am not a big seafood eater but a friend who lives in the area was really adamant that I try it before leaving Vegas. He suggested to me different items from the menu he has tried over the years and what he preferred. I took his suggestion and decided on the shrimp. \n\nAs a super fan of spicy food I had to clarify the spice levels with the waitress. She said their hottest level is like a \"10 out of 10\" so I went with that. The shrimp was hot, juicy, and flavorful (seasoning type: Juicy Cajun) but the spicy level for me was a bit disappointing. Perhaps my tolerance for spiciness is above average though. \n\nAs we came to the conclusion of our meal the waitress asked me how I liked the food and if I was able to handle the spice level. I asked if they had anything hotter. She said she could put in a \"special order\" for the XXX Spicy on a piece of food of my choice. I was too full for another bag of shrimp so I decided to take the spice challenge on the corn cob. 15 min later a piece of corn was delivered to me in a paper-cup bathed in in a thick red sauce. I devoured the corn in the sauce but again this was not a test for me. I'll give the sauce credit, it gave me some of that post burn around my mouth and was spicier than their hottest advertised sauce but I thought it was going to be way worse. Let's just say I WASN'T attempting to wash the corn down with cups of milk or ranch dressing.\n\nAside from my hot sauce story, it was a great place to eat. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, especially the seasonings and spices. There was a minor hiccup as a different waitress served some of the food to the wrong person. All in all it's a fun place to go eat and get messy. Even has a non-seafood lover, I would give this place a go again.\n\nOh, one last thing....the parking here is very limited. I had to park down the side street after attempting to park in nearby parking lots that had \"WE WILL TOW YOUR CAR\" signs."

The sweet potato fries are really good though.\n\nThen the rest of the food.. I like to order one pound snow crabs and a half pound of shrimp in hot n juicy medium sauce for myself. Some people like to do family style but it's easier ordering a bag of food per person and everyone can get their own. I also get a half dozen sausages in hot n juicy medium sauce in a separate cup. And a bowl of rice.\n\nThey say the sauce is one level spicier than it says, so medium is hot and hot is really hot. They also offer no spice to people that don't like anything spicy since their mild can sometimes be a little spicy. Since they make their sauce fresh the spice level can vary. \n\nTheir sauce is very flavorful and not watered down. I've been to places where their sauce mainly tasted like Old Bay seasoning or it was too watery that it didn't stick to the seafood when you dipped it in the sauce after peeling but HnJ's is on point.\n\nI love that they give you bibs and they also offer gloves too. I'm a girl with nails so wearing gloves helps with not getting all the gunk from the sauce stuck under them lol. Either way you'll smell like garlic after leaving here but the food is so worth it!"

            "review": "holy sh*t, i love this place.!!  literally, sh*t... frankly, having this as one of my favorite digs defies common logic as i KNOW eating here will make me sh*t like crazy later.!\n\n*NOTE this is the same review for their new restaurant.   the only difference is layout.   the service, price, and quality of food does not diminish from one place to the other.\n\nTIME SPENT\nonce a week @ Lunch/Dinner times.\n\nLAYOUT\nHJnC seems to be a chain and, for Vegas, this location is the older of the two found in Chinatown.   unlike their newest store, this location has more of a \"dive-in\" look.   it's an open space look with squared tables and 2/3 half moon shaped booth seating towards the back.   \n\ni've stopped coming to this location ever since the new one opened, but i recall the VERY long lines to get in.   they have a couple of seats to help with the waiting inside, but those fill up quick, and so it leads to many customers sitting around randomly (sp.?) outside.\n\nalso note that ths location has LIMITED parking.!   customers tend to park around a adjacent neighborhood or at the shopping center over (tow warning).\n\nthis issue may be gone with the new store opening...   but, garunteed - HJnC is always crowded nonetheles.^^\n\nSERVICE\nno matter which HnJC you're at, the service is OUTSTANDING.   people are cheerful and conversational.   not only do servers ask what you need, but EVERYONE who works there will also eventually ask what you need.\n\nFOOD\nthere's an arguement here on how good the food is.   as i rave about the taste, my southern friends disagree that it's better back home.^^;\n\nmy one CON is the Snow Crab's \"freshness\" being on par with local buffet quality.   i found the shell soft and flavor off (sauce saves it).    you are basicly paying $16 a 1ib for something you can pay $24 and eat without limit at a buffet ($15 @ Rio's World Buffet as a local).\n\ni have ALOT of friends who don't like shellfish, so can recommend their sweet-potato fries, shrimp etouffe (sp.?), battered shrimp, and battered catfish as alternate foods...  all of which, i don't order, but highly enjoy stealing from those who do.^^\n\nPRICING\non average, i eat 6-8ibs of various items (crawfish, clams, snow crab) which normally run $50-$80.   i've had friends do 1-2 ibs of things and spend $20ish...  maybe that'll give you a rough idea.\n\nCLOSING\nHnJC will leave you with a lasting impression.  the service and welcoming you recieve there make it feel like you're eating at home with friends.   it also doesn't hurt that all the waitresses are gorgeous to boot.^^   it's as if they the catalogue of Suicide Girls were waitressing the establishment.!\n\nTIPS\n1.  SAUCES: please don't bother with getting anything under SPICEY.   the seafood just tastes bland otherwise.    EXTRA SPICEY will make you cry.\n2.  Wear clothes u don't care about so you don't have to wear those ridiculous looking bibs...  some people go as far as wearing hamburger helper gloves to eat.!   please save yourself the embarrassment of looking stupid.\n3.  i like to save whatever sauces is left over and pour them into one bag to go.   i know - it sounds YUCK...  but the sauce is great with everything you cook.   Omelletes (sp.?), over dry noodles with egg, etc."

And yes I saw it on Man V Food and it looked interesting. All the great reviews on here didnt hurt either. Well I walked in and it was kinda plain but thats fine. The girl seated us and gave us menus to look over. I was going to order the shrimp instead of the crawfish until the waitress came over. She made the crawfish sound so good I caved and ordered a pound of them. I also ordered a pound of the king crab and some sausage. My mom ordered the fried shrimp and frys. \n    The girl brought out our food and it smelled incredible. I ripped into the bag of crawfish in hopes that I was really in for a treat. Well I have come to a conclusion, THERES NOTHING EDIBLE ON CRAWFISH!!! These things fought me every step of the way. I worked my ass off just to get a \"TINNY\" piece of tale meat. The waitress said they were actually bigger than normal. I would hate the see the regular ones. The flavor of the sauce was absolutely fantastic. I went with the hot and juicy special medium. The sausage dipped in the sauce was out of this world but the crawfish was a miserable failure. I ended up ordering a pound of the shrimp as well.\n    Now the shrimp was another issue. I am not a big fan of whole shrimp. I dont want the head on with all the little hairs all over and the whole thing. If they had been cleaned before cooking it would have been much better. I didnt eat allot of them because of this. The crab legs were pretty good but I should have ordered the same sauce instead of the garlic butter. \n    Hot and Juicy was kinda fun and the 2 waitresses were really sweet and fun to chat with. I dont think I will be coming but though. I do wish them the best."

They didn't put our bibs on for us unlike a lot of places. (it gets kind of uncomfortable having a grown adult help you with your napkin ) they offered gloves to avoid the garlic smell stained to your hands for days!\n\n We ordered a pound of King Crab and a pound of shrimp with medium hot n juicy sauce. I would say the medium sauce is definitely on the mild sauce so I would go higher if you like a nice kick. The crab was good but one leg seemed like it had been cooking a little too long. The shrimp were big and fresh. \n\nAll in all, this place did well and I will be returning"

I have to say that the shrimps are definitely sweeter than I ever remember them, even from way before. Yum yum yum, rock on :D\n\nI also appreciate her thoughtful efforts in pleasing her customers, a rare quality to be seen these days in restaurant owners. I don't live in the area anymore, so I won't be visiting often, however, I took my mom with me on the recent visit and made a big fan out of her. She can't eat the shrimp because of her low sodium diet, but loved the taste and is excited to use HNJ to cater her next house party :)\n\nP.S. The Cajun Fries are way spicier than I remember, I'm not sure if it's my memory or not, but I think I'll get plain ones next time. The House sauce is still deliciously tangy as always!!"

I was told in advance to get shrimp instead of the craw-fish so you don't have to do as much removing of shells.\n\nThe waits are long here and parking is very scarce up front, so be prepared to park on the side street.  The menu is very simple and the waitress is more than willing to explain how everything works.\n\nWe ordered a basket of the hot fries for the table and they lived up to their name.  As tasty as they were it's a good thing to split with a group because I imagine they wear on you in the long-run.\n\nI decided on the Hot N Juicy special sauce shrimp.  They bring it out in a hot plastic bag and from there you go to town.  After an intro lesson from someone in our party, I was peeling shrimp faster and faster as the night went on.  It definitely is a lot of work peeling especially when the food is still a little hot, but on the plus side it slows your pace of eating so you don't eat too much!\n\nAfter all was said and done the food was OK, It's been 3 days and I still have a hint of garlic smell on my hands and the next day when I went for a run my sweat smelled like the sauce!  For all the effort you put in I wish the food was better, but the experience is something to live.\n\nTip:  Make sure to not wear any fancy clothing and possibly ask for gloves so your hands don't stink for days."

So seeing as how Hot and Juicy is so popular and reviews say it's soooo \"amazing\", we decided to stop in before hitting the road to Cali. Their crawfish was $11.99 a lb, and nowhere on the menu did it state that the crawfish came frozen. If we knew I would've never ordered it. We ordered 10 lbs and although the sauces/seasonings were good, the meat was so tough. I was so upset when it came and the sticker on the bag said \"Frozen\". Took them forever to seat us, forever to take our Order and the waitresses all had attitude and were short. Im usually really passive and patient when eating out because I used to waitress and still work in the service industry, but for such a \"famous\" restaurant, our experience sucked. I gave them 3 stars because the crab and lobster was good and so was the seasoning. We had to walk up to ask for extra bowls and spoons and even our check AND TO PAY, you'd think seeing as how we were the biggest party and our tab was $300 they'd somewhat cater to our needs, nope."

We come here every time we visit HNJ and I tried giving the 2nd location in chinatown a 2nd chance the flavors to me taste different and I believe service is better at the original location.. But then again I was wrong.  We were told there was no wait to go to the other location and it's exactly the same I said no because I like this original place better.  To me the flavors are different.   I hyped about HNJ to all my girls for months before our bachelorette party weekend and when we got there the girls were impressed and loved the HNJ sauce!  But our complaint is our server.  She said she could split our tab 3 ways so we grouped into 3 groups.  We had 10 girls. When we got our tab all our bills were wrong some orders were scattered in different groups which isn't a big deal because that can always be fixed.. Then we found out one of the girls had ordered 2lbs of mild HNJ crawfish but only received 1lb she just said forget it. There was a moment where a different server tried to drop off a 1lb of HNJ medium and no one knew who it belonged too we sent it back because no one ordered it well our server told us she brought it back and gave it to is anyways and someone ate it. We told her no one ate it and we would have noticed a extra bag of crawfish sitting around the table!  She couldnt even tell us who she gave it to.  The girls could barely manage what they ordered and I was the only person that ordered a extra lb after my order! The server Helaine said there is a extra order I brought it back out and put it on the table someone ate it and I didn't eat it so I'm not paying for it since I didn't eat it because this is coming out of my pocket! We told her no one got it we returned it and she insisted that she sent it back out! I said u should check ur cameras and roll the tape and see where that extra bag went!  She already got her 18% automatic gratuity from our large group of 10 and she was complaining about $9.99 coming out of her pocket that was our automatic tip that went to her poor rude service!  HNJ should re-evaluate there servers!  We didn't want to cause a scene since there was so many of us.  We figured if she really wanted that $9.99 she can have it!  We definitely did not return!  I been coming here for years and always rave about this place to my friends everywhere but beware the service is a hit or miss!  I admit the seafood is great but service is down right awful!

Not the best idea to come straight from the convention centre, as the Hot & Juicy smell permeated our blazers and followed us around all week, but the experience itself was well worth it. \n\nAnything that made it onto Man Vs Food is likely the opposite of what I am looking to eat, but we decided to give it a try, for the spectacle alone. As soon as we arrived, finger licking smacking, bib wearing ladies were queuing for the washroom  in need of a quick hand wash. Waitresses with big smiles and heavy eyeliner ran around with buckets and plastic gloves on their hands. I was intrigued.\n\nThe two of us sat at our plastic covered tables and ordered beer ($3 for import) 1lb of Crawfish medium Hot & Juicy special, 1 lb of shrimp medium Hot & Juicy special and 3lbs Crab Spicy lemon pepper. We also had 2 ear of corn, and an order of calamari whose accompanying fries never arrived.  It was a ridiculously too much amount fo food but we were starving after a long day on our feet.\n\nEverything arrives in a plastic bag, with sauce puddling along the bottom. The waitress dumps the bag onto your table from her bucket, and will give you a brief demo if necessary. You are instructed to dig in and leave the carcasses in the middle of your table as you plow through. \n\nRegarding the spice, I found medium wasn't enough and I regretted my decision. Also, I regretted ordering so much all at once, as we ate some got cold, which was less appetizing.\n\nFor the novelty (we barely ever see crawfish in Toronto) it was fun. Anything that dirty is always a good time of course. The flavor of the lemon pepper was really outstanding. It was great.  The service was actually among the best we got in Vegas, they were attentive and friendly.  $96 for a mammoth amount of food that could have fed 4 with about 3 beer each.  The crab was good, but I find the crawfish just doesn't give you enough meat. \n\nMinus a star for the impact on the environment from all that waste. I would have been happy with bucket, no bags."

It was sinking too much in the butt area and was not giving way in the legs area. if you were there to lounge and have some drinks, this would have been nice but you need to eat on the table and it was a task to lean forward for us to eat.\n\nwe ordered 2 lbs. of crawfish with the special sauce in mild level(mild level was for my  Girlfriend)....\n\n#3 their mild level sauce is like a hot level sauce. I am not a big fan of spicy hot stuff but i could take some heat. I like wasabe, kimchi, the rooster sauce, tabasco i even eat a pickled jalopeno on its own with out trouble. but the mild sauce that this place offers made the surrounding of our lips look like it had wind burn. either the waitress or food server made a mistake or their mild level is way too hot to be mild.\n\nso bottom line: WILL I GO BACK.....NO!, \"Boiling Crab\" is just a few minutes away"

I guess we all preferred the shrimp....still it was fun.\n2) Mild is still spicey! Be aware that the regular is spicy. I eat like a spice virgin soooooo kinda my own fault. \n( neither con is really anything wrong with them....just preferences..)\n\nOverall it was a great experience and I would go back again!

He was never thrilled with the idea of eating from a bag and leaving the shells on the table.  He's not big into making a mess, but me on the other hand...the dirty just makes it taste better, right?!\n\nSo I went with my mom, cousin, and his wife.  I was excited because I've heard so much about this place and the yelpers can't help but to rave.  Between us all we ordered the 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of snow crab legs (both hot n juicy special, mild), 2 orders of calamari, a basket of chicken, and an order of fries.  \n\nI zeroed in on the seafood, I didn't take all this time to get here to eat chicken!!  My mom freaked out a bit about shrimp with heads and made me pull them off for her (this is why no crawfish...no sucking heads for us that day!)  But she did eventually get over it and was able to take of the heads herself without being grossed out.  Everything tasted really good, just a bit of a kick that didn't overwhelm (enough of a kick for me, I'm a pussy when it comes to spicy).  I don't even remember how many paper towels I personally went through but I'm glad there was an unlimited number of them.\n\nI think the family enjoyed the experience, but when my mom discovered they had plastic gloves after our meal she was disappointed her hands smelt like garlic and seafood.  I just asked the waitress for some lemons for our hands then went and washed them in the bathroom...good as new.  But my dog has that super sonic smell going on and couldn't get over how yummy my hands were!\n\nI'm quite the happy fat-n-preggers girl after this experience.  Baby was definitely happy with all the yummy goodness I fed her.  Now that I know they have some pansy plastic gloves for the hubby I think I've got a better chance to get him to come with me for a return trip.  He's also a sucker for anywhere that serves sweet potato fries. :o)"

We ordered several pounds of crawfish (hot & juicy, mild), shrimp (hot & juicy, mild), chicken wings, and snow crab.  We also had sides of rice and creole fries.  Even though we ordered mild, these crawfish really pack some heat and a lot of garlicky goodness.\nThe corn that comes in the bag is so saturated with the yummy sauce, and I wish there were more corn cobs in the bag.  I also wish I had some bread to sop up all the sauce.\nI actually enjoyed the shrimp and snow crab more than I did the crawfish, probably because there's more meat and the shell is easier to peel.\nThis is a place where you get down and dirty, bibs and all (gloves optional).  Really fun and worth checking out."

The sauce was addictive and I poured some on the rice.  We could have gone hotter and probably will next time.  And $3 beers?  Yay!  I tried a shrimp, which was cooked perfectly.  The Cajun fries unfortunately was lost on me since my mouth was so full of the crawfish seasoning.  Everything was pronounced very tasty and it was fun getting dirty.\n\nThe price was reasonable and we made plans to come back for lunch in two days.  Unfortunately, we didn't make it and I will just have to drive down to DC instead.  \n\nGo here and you will not be disappointed.  Definitely worth the trip off the strip."

            "review": "Man, if this place was only closer to the strip...\"Hot & Juicy Crawfish\" is a solid 4 star on the basis of it's food alone and I'd give it a half-star more if it were within walking distance. \n\nIt's a hole in the wall that makes me drool just thinking about it.  If you like crawfish and traditional New Orleans seafood delicacies kicked up a notch with some authentic and lip smacking Louisiana cajun sauce, you're in for a real treat.  \n\nSo why are you gonna want to try this place?\n\n1) SAUCE\nThe actual reason you're going to this joint is because of the sauce.  Make no mistake - it's the sauce that makes the meal.  Yes, it's great to eat seafood, but their sauce is JUST TO DIE FOR, especially on their crawfish.  \n...Now, me personally - I love the Juicy Cajun, but they also have Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, Louisiana style, and a Hot & Juice Special.  And they'll spice up the sauce to your liking from Mild to Extra Spicy.\n\n2) CRAB\nDo you like crab, because, oh, they've got crab.  Four kinds:\n- Dungeness\n- Louisiana Blue\n- Snow/Opilio\n- Alaskan King\nThey also have softshell crab, shrimp, calamari, and oysters as well if you have a hankerin' for those, but the crab is very tasty and distinctly flavorful for each type.  Even with the sauces, you can very noticably tell the difference between each crab meat.  And it's all sweet and delicious... and steaming hot!\n\n3) CRAWFISH\nThe key is the crawfish though. They're hot and served in a plastic bag on your plastic covered table.  And this is no princess' meal here, folks.  This is down and dirty grubbin'.  Wash your hands before you eat.\n...And you have to eat them CORRECTLY.  Tear off the tail, put the WHOLE head in your mouth and crunch down lightly.  This will allow you to suck out all the juice from the crawfish and with the Juicy Cajun sauce...MMMMMMMM is that good.  Then you finish off with sucking out the tail and you're on to the next one.\n- Live $10/lb\n- Frozen $6/lb\n\nTHE DOWNSIDE:  LOCATION\nThe big problem for me is that this is a $12 cab ride there each way, so you're looking at a $24 surcharge on top of the cost of the crawfish.  It's in the middle of Chinatown in Las Vegas meaning that your first going to have to make the decision whether it's worth your while.  Personally as a foodie, it definitely was, but the cab ride tripled the price of my meal.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIt's a solid 4 stars on the basis of the food alone - it's just that good.  I'd say this meal was more satisfying than a meal at many casino restaurants on the strip making it also a real value.  Keep in mind - you're not gonna go for the ambiance, the location, or the service.  You'll get served for sure, and that's about all you can ask for because you're basically doing all the work. \n\nI'll definitely be back - especially if I go with a group because I can see how this place would be a LOT of fun in addition to being a great meal.  This was a real delight to have for lunch and I'm glad I made the trek."

I ordered: 1/2 lb shrimp with 1/2 dozen sausage, corn, cajun fries, and I tried some of my friends' oysters and crawfish. Got Mild with Hot N Juicy seasoning. \n\nFirstly, prices were a little steeper than BC, maybe $1-2 higher. Dived into the food and after a few bites, my mouth was ON FIRE. Seriously. I got Mild, the lowest spice setting and I had to stop eating a few times because my mouth was suffering. I got the sweats, Corona & water didn't help, and my stomach even hurt a bit. You might call me weak and maybe I am, but I order a Mild at BC and I have no problem finishing a Whole Shabang there. \n\nIt was so spicy that I could barely taste the seasoning. The corn was mushy/soggy. The sausages were good, but still had the same level of insane heat. Oysters were bigger than I'd like, I prefer mine small and sweet. \n\nOverall, the most memorable part of my meal were the sausages and the saltine/oyster/horseradish/cocktail sauce combo.

When we walked in all the tables were not bussed, and they sat there untouched until they did last call. My bf & I aren't messy eaters so we put all of our trash in one bag and a server came to our table and picked it up and moved it to another dirty table. The food came out all at different times, the first thing that came out was the extra seasoning we ordered with our crab & shrimp...and even that was cold. I love king crab and their king crab tasted fishy and very salty and was very small portioned compared to BC or KC. Same as the blue crab, one of which had an empty shell. The shrimp was too fishy for me, my bf said it was fresh but I didn't like the taste. The Cajun fries were the only thing we really liked out of the five things we ordered. Service was poor.

( http://www.kats9lives.com/2008/06/whole-sha-bang.html )\nSince we were taking a family vacation and the parental units like good and cheap foods, I thought hey it would be nice to go Cajun and I came across this place.\n\nFor the full review and pics go to http://www.kats9lives.com/2008/07/hot-n-juicy-in-vegas.html\n\nI don't know if this place or Boiling Crab came first, but I think Boiling Crab probably because they have a bunch of stores.  Either way they are both pretty good and a good value. ^_^ \n\nWe ordered Shrimp, Crawfish, Fried Catfish, Wings, and more.  The sauce was good for the shrimp and crawfish.  It's light on the celery, which I like.  We got a bowl of rice to eat the rice with and that was really good.\n\nIt was too bad that they ran out of the gumbo.  The service was friendly and the food was good.  I think we decided that the shrimp is a better deal because you barely get any meat in the crawfish, but those crawfish are good! Just too much work! =P lol The prices at Boiling Crab are cheaper but Hot n Juicy Crawfish was a great find.\n\nMy family really enjoyed it and the bill was very reasonable.  If you like Cajun food and you are in Vegas then definitely stop by! ^_-"

Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. We ordered 1/2 lb. of shrimp, a lb. of crawfish and sausage and the soft shell crab platter. Seasoning was very tasty. I wish we ordered more shrimp. The soft shell crab was a little too battered. Still glad we gave it a try. I seriously think our waiter made the experience. He was awesome with refilling our drinks and bringing us extra gloves."

I'd highly recommend the lemon pepper sauce with the shrimp and getting crab legs with their famous hot and juicy sauce! Though I'd like to think I like spicy foods it turns out the mild on both of these is spicy enough for me ! Lots of kick in the best sense! Me and my boyfriend usually get a pound or pound and a half of shrimp and a pound of crab legs but when we are really going big we do two pounds of crab legs! A little pricey but so worth it and such a fun date place I love picking everything apart for the meat and getting messy and licking sauce of my fingers it's a great time"

We waited for about 10 minutes on a Saturday night and then got a booth.  \n\nOur waitress was super helpful guiding us through the different flavors and the types of seafood.  We eventually settled on 2 pounds of crawfish and 0.5 pound of shrimp.  i think next time, 1 pound of shrimp, 1 pound crawfish and 1 pound of crab/lobster.  Crawfish heads had tons of flavor BUT paying per pound is working against you with crawfish because it's all shell....at least shrimps have thin shells!  \n\nOrder with beer, order some bread to dip into the sauce.  Wear clothes that you don't like because you WILL STINK like garlic for days to come.  I saw one table with plastic gloves on which may be a good idea....but then I think you lose a bit of the experience if you use gloves.  \n\nDo GO!  This is a MUST DO OFF STRIP experience!!!!"

Worst service ever, nothing compared to the first time we've been there. Honestly, the first time we were there late last year food was awesome (almost as good as BC)\n\nWas there for a late late lunch and we were all starving. I recommended this spot to my fellow travelers and said it's worth the wait and just as good as BC. Waited for about 1 hour and this is a late late lunch around 2-3pm. Got seated and waiter took our order. He confirmed the order and everything was correct. Food came 15 min later. Sauce taste so watered-down, no flavor what so ever. Nothing like the first time we were there. Not only that our friend had ordered 2 lbs of king crab legs. 1 with their special sauce and 1 just steamed (plain.) Everybody got their food except for the steam crab legs. We kept reminding them that we still have not received it and it's been about 20 mins. 5 min later, still nothing. Told another waitress/waiter to check on it. Again, 5 mins later, still nothing. It's been 45 mins and still nothing. Everybody is done eating and one of us still have not gotten plain crab legs. WTH!!! So again, we ask if they have forgotten our order and they said No, it's on order. Told us crab legs takes an average of 25 mins to steam, but yet we got the first lb with sauce and everything in 15 min. Why does it take longer for plain crab legs? Everybody is completely done now and we still did not get the crab legs. We ask what was going on and they said, again we are doing everything we can to fulfill orders and it's very busy and for us to just hang in there. Nobody else was waiting to get seated. There were empty tables and people who came in after us was already finishing up their food. WTH!!! So we ask for the manager and the jerk in charge said with a smile \"there's no manager available right now\" and walked away. We saw the waiter ask him what was going on with their order and he threw his hands in the air, said \"i dunno\" and walked away. Obviously somebody was in charge at the time. WTH!!! And their apology to us was that they will not charge us gratuity since we were not happy. OMG!!! I can't believe this place even made it on the Travel Channel now. We paid for our food even after the way they treated us. Not only that, as I was walking to the restroom to wash my hands, the girl in charge was on the phone with the owner and was explaining to him how it happened and if he hears anything about it... that's what really happened. WTH!!! That did it!!! That was the last call!!! Never ever going there again and never going to recommend it to anybody else. Horrible!!!"

Once we got our food in, it only took 10 minutes for it to hit our table. \n\nI order the shrimp with Juicy Cajun Sauce and a corn and potato. The shrimp was huge and delious. My bf ordered the crayfish and they were really small and disappointing. He got the Hot and Juicy sauce, which was way better then my sauce. Overall, I would push the shrimp over the crayfish, but it was a fun eating experience and I can't wait to go there again the next time I am in Las Vegas!"

As many of stated, you will be expected to get your hands dirty at this place, however they do offer bibs and gloves if needed. And if seeing shrimp with their heads on scares you, then this is not the place for you.  I'm not a big crawfish fan, I just stick to my regular choice when I come here, Hot & Juicy style, Mild, 1 lb of shrimp with corn & sausage with a bowl of rice on the side. It comes to less than$15 total before tax & tips. It is cheap considering it's fresh and well-seasoned seafood!\n\nThe only down side I would say is the parking as many have mentioned here. I was lucky couple times and found a spot in their little strip mall parking lot. But other times I had to park in Church's Chicken lot because all the side streets were taken. And throughout dinner I was nervous that my car would get towed, but luckily it didn't. So my suggestion is carpool, go early if you can! Otherwise if you have a big party and go later, be expected to wait at least 30~45 min at least."

Didn't need my own because they had plenty. Have gotten burned by not carrying my own at other places. \nThe staff was helpful in choosing from the menu. I ordered a pound of Crawfish - Hot & Juicy Med, 1 Lb of King Crab Legs - Hot & Juicy Med, 1 piece of corn, plus one potato, two potato, three potato more. \nWhat gives with the only one per order on the tiny baby potato? \nA girls gotta eat. Why can't they fit two or three potatoes in the bowls?\nThe Crawfish was presented in its bag of splendor. Waiting to burst out in all sorts of flavorful excitement. One whiff and you'll see what I'm talking about. Garlic, Garlic and more Garlic, with some other spice that is captivating. By the time if figured out that all the Crawfish was gone I was already elbow deep in the succulent juices. Then I attacked the King Crab Legs. They tasted frozen, thawed and reheated in the Hot & Juicy sauce. I called the wait staff over and let her know how the crab legs tasted. She asked if I wanted something else. \nI asked how often they deliver the crab and she said every day. \nI would not order them again I guess that's why Crawfish is in the name. \nWell, I smelled of Garlic for a few days so you can't hide where you've been after eating here. \nDress casual, tie a bib on and enjoy. They won't disappoint with the Crawfish. Oh, and ask for a second bib for your lap. Stuff can drip on you if your not careful."

They were out o f a couple of items we would have tired, but we did get the king crab, whole blue crab, crawfish, and calamari. The crawfish and the crab we got with varying amounts of heat, all on the Hot n Juicy sauce. The sauce was very good. Plenty of tase, not simply liquid butter. Add dollar beers to that(not sure if all bottles are $1 everyday or not) and it added up to a very good time. I would definately go back.\n\nThe only minus is that they really have nothing BUT seafood. Several in our party do not like this kind of seafood, so their only choice was chicken wings(which they do not even have sauces for, they come out dry) and fries. A bit small of a non seafood choice.\n\nOur waitress was very helpful and attentive as well."

When we got our food, the food runner gave us an extra half pound of shrimp instead of the half order of sausage. We flagged our server and she apologized and sent it back. Minutes later, the food runner gave us another bag of half pound shrimp.. Perhaps we didn't make ourselves clear enough before, but we sent it back again and told her that it was sausages not shrimp. It happened like again after and when we finally got the sausages, we weren't even hungry anymore. \n\nFor a small place with a lot of workers the service was a bit slow. Maybe it was just that one time we came in, but yeah maybe I'll come back.. But for the time being, my heart is where my favorite spot at home is."

I got there at 730 and asked for a table for 3, they said 25 minute wait, no problem. About 8:05 they called my name and sat us in the back in a half booth but it had a square table so it was really akward. A round table would have been much better.\n\nTo eat, I ordered 1lb of shrimp with the hot n' juicy seasoning, and then added a piece of corn and potato. My friends both ordered 1lb of king crab with lemon pepper and juicy cajun seasonings. Right after our server took our order, a big party of 15 came in and was seated right next to us. Our server tended to them immediately. After about 25 minutes we have had no refills, and we have no food. I start to notice that people who came in AFTER us are getting their food. I joke and say \"I think they forgot about us.\" We stop a waitress and ask whats going on and she tells us some bullshit lie that our food is coming but that we have the king crab and that can take a little bit longer. Now its been at least 45 minutes and no food. Our server finally comes to our table and tells us she is so sorry and so embarassed but she forgot to put our order in, but she put it in right now and it is being pushed to the front of the line. Now at this point im PISSED off. She was soo worried about serving the table of 15 and just forgot about us. Before we even get our food the table of 15 is already starting to get appetizers. Our food finally came around 9:10 and it was good thats why the 2 stars. The hot n juicy seasoning is delicious but SOO garlicky. I still smell like garlic today. I tried some of my friends lemon pepper crab and that was reallly good. For 2lbs of king crab and 1lb of shrimp our total was like $80 which is not bad. But I will not be back because of the shitty service. I will try the other location a little bit down the street and hope we dont get forgotten about.  FYI the servers  name is ASHLEY, dont get her because she FORGETS everything! Even the people next to us were mad because she forgot to add potatoes and corn to their bag."

            "review": "Pretty good...for Vegas.  Here's my recap:  Parking could be better.  Not a lot of spaces.  Available spaces were a little tight.  Seated immediately upon entering.  The place was pretty busy.  Many tables with chairs, some with booths.  Some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  Servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  Menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, blue crab, dungeness crab, King crab, and snow crab.  All market prices.  Seasoning choices were Louisiana style, juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper, and Hot N Juicy special.  Choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  Sides: corn, potato, sweet potato fries, cajun fries, rice, rolls, and sausage.  Also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  We ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one Louisiana style medium and the other juicy Cajun medium.  Bibs were served first.  The bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  We also ordered a side of white rice.  The cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  Constant line for men's restroom.  Only one person at a time.  Many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  The food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  I prefer this method.  The shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  Plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  The shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  There was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  Also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  The shrimp was head and shell on.  This requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  I lived in Louisiana for many years so I know there is a difference between Louisiana style and Cajun style, but I don't know why they made the distinction here.  Most patrons in Vegas won't know the difference.  The difference here is that Louisiana had more butter and Cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  The difference is almost not noticeable, but I prefer their Louisiana style.  The rice was okay.  All in all the food was pretty good.  We really enjoyed it.  On a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  That is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  Vegas patrons don't know any better.  Its kind of gross, but I ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  There were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but I would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at Cravin Cajun.  You get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  They do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  The server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  Shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side of rice was $2.  We really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  I tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  It was the best crawfish in Vegas.  Flavor was right, but a bit small for Louisiana standards.  I love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  I really like this place, but Cravin Cajun is better."

The Fried catfish was so good!  The crust was perfect and the fish was so juicy on the inside.  The snowcrabs are to die for!  It comes in a plastic bag with the crab drenched in the sauce.  I swear for at least 5 minutes, you could not hear anyone talk because they were just eating.

Same concepts of your choice of spiced seafoods and appetizers, minus the one hour wait of Boiling Crab (at least the time that I went there). Our party of four was seated with hardly a five minute wait. Spicy. Spicy. Spicy. LOVED it. \n\nThe only advice I have for future patrons are:\n1) If you go and plan on going out after, PLEASE do yourself a favor and either bring a large bottle of Listerine and cologne/perfume OR\n2) Go with enough time to go home/back to your hotel for a nice, LONG shower to cleanse the smelliness from your hair, body and a fresh change of clothes!"

My family decided to order to go since there was about 20 of us total and we didn't want to go to the restaurant. My aunt ordered about 200$ worth of shrimp/crawfish. When she got home I was ready! But to my dismay, the food was HORRIBLE. The shrimp was NOT fresh at all and fell apart when we peeled the skin off. It was like eating powder... the crawfish, I already knew that they weren't fresh and were frozen. But they were even better than the shrimp. I don't know what happened. It felt so surreal, I've been to Hot n Juicy on several occasions before and I was very pleased. The shrimp were always plump and juicy. The crawfish was good as well. The only thing that's good about this place is that the sauce was good.\n\nI'm almost embarrassed to write this update because I told so many friends/family about this place. It was most of my family's first time experiencing cajun seafood and they were all dissatisfied. They didn't understand why I liked it so much. We had over half of our order left over.

Do you want a Hot guy/gal, or do you want a Smokin' guy/gal?!   Told you so!\n\nTime of Visit:\nHot - Thursday night around 9pm\nSmokin' - Friday night around 9pm\n\nWait time:\nHot - For eat in, there were 7 parties ahead of us so we decided to do take away.\nSmokin' - Lots of room; seated at a booth promptly.\n\nParking:\nHot - small parking lot so we had to park in the dark residential alley akin to Freddie Krueger's neighborhood.  It was a bit scary and we ran for the car.\nSmokin'- plenty of room in the shopping center.  No sweating or running required.\n\nService:\nHot - Given the wait time, decided to order to go at the to-go counter.  There were 3 staffers there, but no one acknowledged us for a solid 5 minutes.  We didn't even get a \"be with you a minute.\"  Ignored and they didn't care!\nSmokin' - cast and crew were very attentive... actually beyond attentive.  The tag team waiter and waitress were great, funny, and helpful.  Billy, I can tell you love your job since you are just fab at it.\n\nPrice for crawfish:\nHot - $11.99/lb\nSmokin' - $11.99/lb\n\nQuality of crawfish:\nHot - tasted frozen and lots of cracked heads.  It's never a good thing to have a crack head.  Most of the crawfish were very small.  Size does matter when it comes to the crawfish.\nSmokin' - obviously live crawfish, lots of different sizes and heads were all in tact.  Meat had a nice chew.\n\nThe Gear\nHot - bib and gloves (to go), you provide your own table cloth (I used the hotel laundry bags!)\nSmokin' - high end paper table cloth, bib and gloves\n\nPoop sack:\nHot - Not sure what these crawfish were swimming in, but the pooped sacks were very full of who knows what.\nSmokin' - Poop sacks not as heinous as Hot and actually most were pretty white as oppose to black.\n\nSeasoning:\nHot - Ordered the Hot N Juicy Special in mild.  It had great depth of flavors with different levels of seasoning.  Hot actually wins in this category.\nSmokin' - Ordered Smokin' Style in mild.  Flavors were good and garlicky, but just a notch below the layers at Hot.  However, my companion thinks Smokin' wins in this category also....  Sigh, I guess I'll have to come back again and again to taste test.\n\n2nd Date Quality (the come-back factor):\nHot - Not even if you treat me like a call girl and paid me.\nSmokin' - Anytime baby!\n\nAtmosphere:\nHot - Hurry up and eat so we can get someone else's a$$ in your chair.\nSmokin'- Take your time and talk to me.  Also, try to win a lobster from the claw machine while you are at it and Smokin' will even cook it for you."

Not a big fan of the crawfish but ordered some anyway, and yep..still don't like them, the shrimp is great though. I guess we got lucky with time since there was no wait for tables. We got served promptly but got slow later on. Overall experience is good. Most likely visit again when I'm in town :)"

Add some juicy crawfish into their Hot n Juicy seasoning in spicy level and Cajun medium level and BAM you have a party in your mouth, and hands, and mouth and all over.  Yum.  I'd come back here next time I'm in Vegas and maybe I'll try to the other seafood goodness..  \n\nService is so-so but who cares if the food comes fast!"

I had 1lb of crawfish, 1lb of shrimp, and 1lb of clams, and in retrospect I would say 2.5 lbs instead of the 3lbs I had would have been a better choice as I was extremely full after this. If you like crawfish then go ahead and order it here, if you never had it or are on the fence I would refrain because a) its much harder to eat than the other items b) they can be somewhat small so you spend a lot of time for little meat.\n\nI am docking a star because of the garlic overpower at times, and surprisingly it lasts for about 10 hours after you eat and you will have it in your breath and constantly taste it even after brushing your teeth. Wake up in the morning and you might be burping garlic flavors. They have a few different flavors so not everything has to be spicy and hot but it all mixes so it tastes pretty much the same."

But then again, there were larger groups of people who were still waiting outside, so maybe it's a good idea to come in smaller groups!  It was also Labor Day.\n\nWe ordered the following items:\n1 lb. of shrimp\n1 lb. of craw fish\na couple ears of corn each\nSweet potato fries\n\nand we had this in the \"mild\" hot n juicy sauce.\n\nBoy was it NOT mild.  It was super hot!  But it was so good.  The sauce was best paired with the craw fish.  The juice from the shrimp does not take as well, but if you peel the shrimp and then plunge the entire body into the sauce in the bag, then you are good to go with the awesome hot n juicy and very garlicky flavor.  You must love butter, you must love garlic, and you must be able to handle spicy.  \n\nThis place is pretty good, and comparable to Boiling Crab in the Bay Area, maybe even better in my opinion.  I have to go back and check as I've only been there once.  \n\nNot sure this would be a good date night, but I like a man who can take in some spice.  I find it very flattering!  So why not, bring your date here, see if he can pass the hot test!  You will have fun with the interactive eating, and the get down and dirty environment; bibs and all!  YUM!  I'll be back here soon, once I get this garlic and seafood smell off me for awhile.  It certainly sticks to your clothes so don't bother going out after eating here!"

We have been here at least 10 times, but this review will focus on our Valentine's Day experience. \n\nThere are three locations now in Vegas, and this is apparently the original one in the city. It is in an old beat up strip mall of sorts, and this is definitely not a fancy type establishment. But the restaurant is clean and there are no complaints in that regard, it is just on the \"bare bones\" side of things. \n\nService: we went early on V-Day because we knew it'd be busy. We were quoted 20 minutes and were seated in 5. Our server was polite, attentive, and helpful with our beverage questions. Food was delivered quickly and multiple people checked in with us and offered refills and extra gloves. \n\nFood: I do agree that most of the sauces taste very similarly, but if you're coming here to eat sauce, you kind of lost the point...At least three taste the exact same to me. If you want contrast, lemon pepper doesn't taste anything like the Hot n Juicy flavor in my opinion. The shellfish is incredibly fresh and well cooked (you can tell by how it comes out of the shells), and the variety of multiple types of muscles and multiple times of crab is nice. \n\nMy only real complaint (not enough to lose a star over), is that I wish there were more vegetable options. I like having more than a small ear of corn with my meals...\n\nI strongly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys shellfish."

We always talked about wanting to try one of the places he went to. We were there...fuck it; why not?\n\nOh. My. Fucking. God.\n\nAny restaurant that gives you a bib, has a garbage bag table cloth, and a huge roll of paper towels on the table ready for you definitely has a lot to live up to. We order 6 lbs of crawfish. Served literally hot and juicy looking in a bucket. You can see tons of garlic and sauces and even a potato and corn cob piece inside. We didn't even hesitate; we ripped opened the bags and started tearing some fucking heads off. \n\nThat was probably the most amazing thing I have ever tasted. \n\nIt was so flavorful and juicy and the spices kicked your ass a little, but you kept on eating anyway. Downing Sapporo's and water like there was no tomorrow. Not giving a flying fuck about heartburn or any other internal problems you'd potentially endure later. \n\nIt turned into one of our fondest Vegas memories.\n\nThat was 4 months ago and it's a FREQUENT topic amongst my friend and I to this day. We often turn to one another and say we'd give ANYTHING just to have that. We would drive that 11 hour drive all over again just to eat that. We didn't exaclty LOVE Vegas. At times, we absolutely hated it.\n\nI hope I don't talk this up too much, but you must try it. You have to really dig in there and eat with your hands. Crawfish. Not shrimp or something you eat with a fork (although I bet it's delicious!). Pick that shit up with your hands and fucking enjoy going against any table manners your parents taught you. \n\nFuck you if you don't stop by before you leave Vegas."

They were brought to us in plastic bags all steaming and full of flavor.  The crawfish were ah-mazing.  They were so hot to the touch that I didn't care if my tongue got burnt. I could not get enough of them.  The seasoning was addicting and wanted to have it on everything.  The boys were done eating before sis and I even really got started.  We can put a lot back.\n\nCome here.  Don't walk. Run.  Or drive since its off the strip.  You will thank me.  But just a warning, your clothes will smell like the food.  It's that potent."

Their food is spicy so order their mild which is actually medium.\n\nThe crawfish wasn't interesting after the first one. They look like aliens and you can see their prominent lungs after you take off the shell attached to the head. The tail meat is about the size of my thumb's nail.  Don't try breaking open the claw, it's hard to do and the meat is so insubstantial that it's simply not worth the time to get to it.   I don't recommend the crawfish unless you are patient and on a diet.  It would have helped if shell crackers were available for the crawfish.\n\nThe shrimp is much more interesting and worthwhile, you can really taste the lovely butter mix when you eat their little arms.  However, don't suck out the heads because the heads taste very bitter!  They don't devein the shrimp so expect to eat shrimp poop.  \n\nThe whole eating process is amazingly messy (the name Hot N Juicy is appropriate) and expect to stay for about an hour at least to take off the shells of each small creature.  This is definitely not the place for a date unless you find butter and shrimp poop sexy.\n\nDefinitely order the corn, it absorbs the butter and spices beautifully. \n\nThis is a place to enjoy a messy but delicious meal. I recommend their shrimp.  Service was fast and friendly."

Don't let customers think you are switching out food - I had already stuck my dirty fork into the one they snatched back from me and brought back to someone else within 1 minute.   I also didn't get what I ordered.\n\nThe food was average.  I decided to try this location after a horrible experince at another location of the same chain several months back.  The crawfish are especially small and impossible to eat because they break apart trying to get them out of the shell.  They really screwed up the crawfish bad.  I've eaten a lot of crawfish.  The shrimp on the other hand is top notch - sweet, wonderful texture, easy to eat.   I'll try this place again next time I save up another hundred dollar bill to afford it.  When that happens I guarantee I will not eat the crawfish.\n\nThe difference between 2 stars (Meh.

Located about two miles from the strip, give or take a few feet, Hot N Juicy is located in Vegas' \"Chinatown\", although I saw more Vietnamese and Korean joints than I did Chinese. \n\nFirst of all......if you are waiting outside the front door, BEWARE THE RAMP LOCATED BY THE DISABLED PARKING SPOT! Its made out of the same asphalt that the rest of the parking lot is made out of, and the wife didn't see it, and she ate shit............Please be careful. \n\nWith that being said, we went this past Sunday, (05/29/11), and it was jam packed. Right away, they let us know that they just opened up another location down the street, but we politely declined and toughed out the wait. For our party of 10, which we said didn't mind having split up if it got us in faster, the wait time was only about 30-40 minutes, and they told us it would be about as much. \n\nWhen we were seated, the waitress was kind enough to explain the flavors and levels of spiciness and she was right on. Getting right into it, we tried the shrimp (lemon pepper and garlic butter, both mild), the fried catfish basket with fries, the corn on the cob, and the steamed rice. \n\nSHRIMP- \n\nBig, fat, juicy, and oh so tasty. Unlike other places similar to this one, the sauces they used for both types we tried were kind of thin in terms of thickness (?), but VERY, VERY, VERY FLAVORFUL. We've been to places that the sauce is almost sandy or chalky, but here, it is like a nice shrimp stock, and we easily and most enjoyably poured it all over our steamed rice, which made it that much better! \n\nCATFISH- \n\nThe catfish basket comes with fries. Fries, who can F those up? Not these guys! Crisp, crunchy, and salty. Perfect the way a fry should be. The catfish, perfectly cooked, comes in a nice cornmeal type of coating that adds a little extra crunch. Only problem is, they only give you about a fillet and a half, if that. I've been to places where they give you almost 3 fillets and that would have to be my only bitch about the fish. \n\nSIDES- \n\nCorn on the cob was awesome. Boiled, Buttery, sweet, and not overcooked. Simplicity at its finest. \n\nSteamed Rice- ditto. Simple, yet delicious. \n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE- \n\nThe wait was expected. It was out the door just like other people said. Waitresses were very helpful, but with the exception of the first refill, were slow on the next couple. As far as ordering more food, they were spot on. I'd come back over here for sure, and I'd bring my friends too. If you don't mind a wait, or taking the roads less traveled, be brave and head this way!"

The one unique thing that we noticed was that this place had a fried soft shell crab platter, which you only get like 1 crab or just barely more.\n\nThe shrimp didn't seem as fresh as what you'd get at Boiling Crab as most of the heads were falling off the shrimp in our bags.  The fried fish platter also was on the smaller side, 3 pieces of fish.  The cajun fries were not what you'd expect, it looked like they sprinkled on the spices as they were in the basket so the spices are not really distributed evenly on each fry. The service was a step down from Boiling Crab, it's slower, they aren't really on the ball for drink refills.\n\nOverall the food was still pretty good, if I could give it 3.5 stars I would, but for me 4 stars is a place I'd recommend unconditionally.

Everything was great. The shrimp was the highlight. We had hot and juicy flavor with some mild and some medium. The medium was described as \"Tabasco\" level heat. The description was accurate. Some heat but not overpowering. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable. I will be back to try the crab."

I definitely recommend adding corn to your bag of seafood because it soaks in the flavor and juices and it tastes SO GOOD! Beware that the shrimp comes out with the heads still attached and you have to peel off the shells yourself. My friend wasn't warned and I think she was a little surprised hahah. \n\nSo I tried their crawfish and the shrimp in their signature Hot N Juicy sauce (which is a mix of all of the sauces) and it definitely satisfied my seafood cravings. I found it so much fun to eat with your hands like a kid. You get a plastic bid and by the end of the meal, my hands were completely messy hahah so much fun! However, the smell did stick around for awhile but the experience was worth it. Plus, the food came out SO FAST. Our order was ready in less than 10 mins! AWESOME!\n\nWe also got some sweet potato fries and cajun fries to share which was a nice side to have. So come prepared to be extremely messy and eat your weight in seafood!\n\nPrice wise: you pay by the pound. It ended up being around $10/lb for the shrimp and crawfish."

If you're afraid to suck the crawfish heads and eat all the juicy stuff inside, then shrimp is the way to go.  It's 2 dollars more per pound but you'll also get alot more food with less shell.\n\nI love crawfish more but since I'm from the South I'm used to paying  3-4 bucks a pound.  To fulfill my desires I'll get 2 lbs shrimp, 1 lb crawfish with my friend.\n\nWe like to get extra corn and potatoe since it's so yummy.  \n\nThey tend to understate the heat so a medium is probably hot, and hot is extra.....and so forth.\n\nGreat place - definitely check it out!"

The clams were not washed well and had sand bits in them. Anyone who's bit into a grain of sand knows what I'm talking about. The catfish basket was more expensive, had a subpar batter and had much less catfish than they give at BC. One thing I'll give them credit for is their shrimp...big and super fresh. BC has tendency for old shrimp that become mushy, so this is one area BC could improve on."

But here's what I don't get...why \"ruin\" the food but make it extremely SPICY to a point no one can eat the food just because you just want them to get out of your restaurant? If that's the case, why not tell the customer that the kitchen is closing and you have already seated the last table instead of telling them they have 2 minutes to order! As memory should have serve you RIGHT, the group of people you just TRIED to push away have been loyal customers of HOT & JUICY since DAY 1; so of course it'll take less than 2 minutes to order! \n\nI am definitely still raving about this because I still cannot believe how rude people can be. Sadly, I miss the food. But I shall stand my ground until Lainie B. and Mario can apologize publicly for treating customers the way they did.

Come on, it's a SEAFOOD restaurant, and you can't give your customers something as simple as a plastic tool to open crab legs?  She did manage to bring two more to our table.\n\nOnly the crawfish included corn & potatoes.  I can understand not including sausage with boiled seafood, but one tiny potato and half an ear of corn for three people added $4 to our bill.  How hard could it be to just include this in every boiled seafood menu item?  Petty money grab, IMO.

I have no idea what was in \"Juicy Cajun\" or \"Louisiana Style\" - White pepper?  Black pepper?  Red pepper?  Paprika?  No clue whatsoever with no information in the menu, and server didn't know either.\n\nParking lot is too small for the capacity of the restaurant.  \n\nIf you go -\nCall ahead and ask if they have the seafood you want\nPark on the street\nIf you plan on ordering crab, bring your own crab tools\nTell your server to bring the corn and potatoes with your seafood."

So my goal was to try to eat here for new years eve as 1 of my last meals for 2009.  Since I'm a big fan of crawfish, that's what we ordered along with the shrimp.  So 4 lbs of food between 2 people along with rice for my friend.  Since I am from Cali, we do have to compare every place to Boiling Crab.  So far, BC is the top.  This place would come in 2nd place.  The prices are pretty reasonable for the seafood since they are market price.  I wish they did post the prices up somewhere but they don't so you do have to ask how much it is per lb for the seafood items.  You do have to order the Hot N Juicy flavoring.  We didn't do the extra spicy and spicy was good enough for us since it did make our nose watery.  As for the size of the crawfish, they were sooo small.  I thought they might be a little bit bigger, but nope.  Small that I even had to take a picture of it since I think I was in shock from the size of it.  ;p  None the less, it was still yummy and I would definitely go back if I was craving crawfish in lv.  Note to remember, you do have to ask for the bibs and salt, pepper, lime sauce since they don't bring it to you initially like BC.  Service was pretty good except there was 1 waitress that seemed a little bit rude when she was talking to the guests so not sure if she was having an off day or if that's just her personality."

Every time we went, we ate inside, and loved the food!! The last two times, we got takeout. Boy, was that a horrible idea!! Mind you, we have to drive 30 minutes to get there, and 30 minutes to get home. The first time we got takeout, the pound of snow crab and the 4, that's right, 4 pounds of crawfish were cooked in the wrong sauce and WAY too spicy. My friend was visiting from out of town, and is a breastfeeding mother. Her snow crab was so hot, it was practically on fire. Brutal. I called and talked to the manager Olena. She said she would comp the pound of snow crab and the 4 pounds of crawfish. I was pissed, but I was satisfied because we really liked the food normally. A week later, on 9/20/2014, I decided to order takeout again. Bad freaking idea AGAIN!! I didn't call it in this time, because I wanted to make sure we would get what Olena promised me. I order. Of course. Olena only comped us 2 pounds of crawfish. I was upset, but there was no manager there for me to talk to, so I just paid for the extra two pounds. We also ordered rice, shrimp, and an order of catfish and fries to go. Our order comes out, the guy that brought it out quickly goes through it. He says it's all there. I say thanks and walk out. As we are driving away, I think about the catfish and fries. I didn't remember seeing it. So, I look in the bag. ITS NOT IN THE BAG. UGH!! And of course it's 5:00 traffic. 5 mins later I walk back in to get the catfish. I look at the same lady that helped us and she grabs the bag sitting on the counter. Wtf? I guess she already knew that they forgot, and they were WAITING for me to come back. So frustrating. Here is the worst part: As I'm walking out, I glance back and all the staff behind the counter are laughing about it. Seriously? Is this how you train your staff? I realize they are all 15, but come on. We will be going to the Boiling Crab from now on. Too many broken promises and horrible customer service...."

I saw this featured on Man VS Food and oh boy, I can sense the goodness emanating from the TV and I made my husband promised to take me there. So one weekend off we went to Vegas, not for the casinos or the shows but for Hot N Juicy and it was worth the 4 hour drive from Temecula! There was a short wait when we went there, we ordered shrimp and crab, sweet potato fried and corn. Me and my husband demolished every bit of the 2 lb shrimp and 1 lb crab. The sauce was delicious and I literally licked my fingers."

After several trips, I've come to learn my favorite flavors and spice ratings. I love the hot n juicy special at a mild or medium level. These levels have a good amount of spice that doesn't hurt my face.\n\nNow, I'm not a very good spicy food eater. But I have been here with different groups of friends and have had the opportunity to sample the different spice levels. I can say the extra spicy is very very hot, and it builds with every bite you take. Your lips continue to burn, but you can't resist the tastiness and continue to eat, despite the pain. But what I really like and appreciate about the extra spicy flavors is the fact that you can still taste the flavor despite the heat. Your mouth isn't reduced to just a ball of fire.\n\nAnd on that note, I would recommend any seafood lover to visit this fine establishment."

Knowing that this place was been made famous from this show, I came here for lunch on Friday of my last Vegas visit.\n\nWe met one of my brothers-in-law for lunch here, arriving in the parking lot 5 minutes before 12 noon.  Even though the restaurant wasn't even open yet, there were over a dozen people waiting outside the door already!  \n\nOnce the staff let the horde in, we were seated right away and given menus.  As this is an Asian-owned establishment, I recommend not ordering all spicy seasoning, unless you can power through the heat.  Here's what I ordered for our party of 3:\n\n1 pound of shrimp, with Garlic Butter, mild spice\n1 pound of crawfish, Louisana Style, medium spice\n1 order of Calamari\n1 order of Sweet Potato Fries\n\nThe fries and calamari came out first; they were good and hot, but not exceptional.  But when the shrimp and crawfish arrived, the real feast began.  The shrimp were big, and the sauce was mild and tasty.  And while the crawfish were cooked in a \"medium\" sauce, it was plenty hot for me and my dining companions.  Just be careful not to suck the sauce too quickly; it will clear up your sinuses in a hurry!\n\nJust like any of these seafood boil places, be ready to get down and dirty.  They have lobster bibs and full rolls of paper towels on the tables for a reason!\n\nOverall, this was one of our favorite meals in Las Vegas.  It's in Chinatown and pretty far away from the Strip, so rent a car to get here."

The shrimp was really good with the signature hot and juicy sauce, even better than what I've had at boiling crab *gasp!! My friends and I shared deep fried soft shell crab, catfish, and fries, which were all really yummy.\n\nWhat brought it waaaay down for me was the HORRIBLE service! We went to eat there on a Saturday evening, so we were expecting it to be really busy, but it wasn't. Thought that would be a good thing because our server would probably have more time to be attentive, but NO! My friend's mouth was on fire from the spicy sauce and had to ask for a coke refill 4 times before a different server finally came and refilled her cup, I had to ask for water 3 times, my other friend's plastic bib broke and she had to repeatedly ask for another before someone finally brought her a new one.\n\nWhen I received my bag of shrimp, there was a hole in it and juices were leaking everywhere. I politely asked the server if I could have another bag just to place the one I already had inside because I didn't want to lose all the sauce to my table, and he replied with a horrible attitude, telling me I wouldn't need one because it would be messy anyway. I then replied with, \"Can you just get me a bag like I asked for please?\" And he proceeded to throw his hands in the air, say \"Fine,\" in a very sarcastic tone, and just threw the bag on the table. Um, excuse me?? First of all, I wanted to save my delicious sauce for my rice, not for licking off the f*cking table, DICK. I wish I ordered crab instead of shrimp so I could use the claws to attack him.\n\nOverheard the tables next to ours complaining about the bad service and the unnecessary attitudes as well. I hope the management at this establishment figures out a way to properly train their employees to be helpful, attentive, and polite. Until that happens, I won't be returning to Hot and Juicy."

My homegirls from NYC came to visit and I suggested that we try this place since none of us have ever tried crawfish.  So here we are 1 guy and 3 girls and we ordered 1 lb of crawfish - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 dungenuss crab - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 lb of shrimp - garlic butter sauce, cajun fries and 3 corn on the cob.\n\nThe shrimp yields more meat than the crawfish, however the hot and juicy spicy sauce is the way to go if you can take the heat!!  It'll get your lips burning at the end of the meal.  \n\nThe dungenuss crab was the star of the night for us.  It was 1.8 lbs and about $28.  We had it made with the hot and juicy spicy sauce and it came whole, which means you had to do the dirty work yourself.  Getting down and dirty with crab is my thing!  I go to any buffet and ill sit there and eat crab legs all night long!  Anyways, the sauce and the crab was fantastic!  It was sooo good we ended up going to the supermarket the next day and bought 4 two pound dungeness crabs, one for each of us, so we could make some more crab. LoL\n\n Anyways, 4 pounds of seafood and 5 beers later, we were stuffed.  We enjoyed our food.  We would suggest the crawfish if you've never had them before, but the shrimp is better.  Must get the dungeness crab if you are willing to spend the money.  Total charge was $80 including tip, not bad for 4 people.  I will definitely go back there with more out of town friends."

In the past few years, virtually every place she thought I would like turned out to me... just Average, at best... And she heard from my youngest kids, that Dad doesn't like to touch his food - which is mandatory at Hot 'n Juicy.\n\nWhen your Pound of either Blue Crab, Shrimp, or Crawfish is brought out in it's plastic bag... the Plastic Bib and the Paper Towels are definitely not enough \"protection\" to prevent yourself from getting MESSY! In fact, I'm proud to admit after the four of us finished the 2 pounds of combos - we had the largest remnants of \"stuff\" by far of anyone dining that evening.\n\nYou'll receive a free Cob of Corn and a small Potato with every 2 Pounds of stuff ordered. But, I recommend more - just for the fact that you'll have something pretty neutral to offset the HEAT from the Crawfish.\n\nHot 'n Juicy's recommendation of how to eat Crawfish is:\n 1) Gently twist the head apart from the tail.\n 2) Take the head and SUCK the juice from inside.\n 3) Peel away 2 to 3 segments of shell from the tail to expose more meat.\n 4) Pinch the bottom end of the tail while carefully pulling the meat out of the shell.\n\nI have a few modifications to this procedure... Why would I suck on a Crawfish head when I don't do it to it's bigger cousin Lobster? That just.... SUCKS! I break off the tail from the head section and only retrieve the meat from the tail section.\n\nThe absolute best value is the Shrimp...\nI treat the Shrimp at Hot 'n Juicy like the Salt & Pepper Shrimp that is prepared at Chinese restaurants. I consume the tail section, shell and all - it's just too much work trying to de-skin the Shrimp! When Robyn heard that --- Eww!\n\nRobyn's recommendation: Order a pound of Blue Crab Legs and a pound of Shrimp.\n\nKevin and Kathy's (my daughter) suggestion: Crawfish and Shrimp.\n\nMy suggestion: After a Crawfish & Shrimp combo... I'd go for a Shrimp and Shrimp...\n\nSuggestions for sides - Bread Rolls, Potatoes, Sausages are OK. Corn on the Cob, which is boiled along with the Crawfish literally turns into Cream of Corn - way too soft.\n\nAnd... don't Breathe and Eat at the same time! Took me a few minutes to recover from the HEAT going down! Kevin tried some of my Spicy Crawfish and subsequently devloped a heat reaction - blotches of red all over his face and neck. I think for most - Spicy is hot enough.\n\nRobyn was totally shocked when I gave Hot 'n Juicy a Yelper rating of 5-Stars - despite that fact that you can't avoid getting Messy here and despite scrubbing down with virtually all the Soap in the restroom afterwards and returning home probably needing a Bath / Shower... you can't help but have a pretty good time!\n\nI can't think of a more enjoyable time to spend a couple of hours people watching - customers or your dinner companions getting down n' dirty with the Crawfish, or just to lower your own clean-freak inhibitions.\n\nI was wondering why this restaurant was located in the un-officially designated Chinatown along Spring Mountain... So far as I could see that evening, there was only one waitress of Asian descent... I queried our waitress whether Hot 'n Juicy was Asian-owned - she replied that the owner was Thai and resided in Texas and was the second Crawfish place he owned.\n\nHighly recommended by one who abhors using his dainty fingers....\n\n\nI do have one last thought though.... What exactly is the chemical reaction of flash boiling on a Plastic Bag? Are there any chemical breakdowns of the Plastic Bag that the USDA should be worried about?"

Since the latest competition, Boiling Crab, migrated towards the valley from Southern California we could see that the battle of the rivals are still in order. The question is, who serves the best shrimp?\n\nI'll be brutally honest that my point of view is biased because i have yet to taste the savory goodness of Boiling Crab. So until I have tried its savory goodnes, my critic will rest at recommending Hot and Juicy until further notice. \n\nBesides the raving hype that Adam Richman did feature Hot and Juicy on man V. Food, I can say that the feshness and the flavor of the seafood here are just to DIE FOR. Literally, you eat all the shrimp and crab you can consume until you fall face first first into a food coma (this my ideal way of leaving this earth). \n\nI love the spice and tangy flavor of their famous Hot and Juicy sauce. My first mistake as a first timer is underestimating their love for HOT. So I got the hot flavor of the Hot and Juicy sauce. My mouth was literally burning with fire, and I couldn't enjoy the flavor of the sauce because the spice was taking over my taste buds. So if you are all for an inferno party in your mouth, I'd suggest the Hot  Hot and Juicy sauce.\n\nMy personal favorite is the less than mild Hot and Juicy sauce with all the right flavors with just the right amount of spice that I can handle baby! (ow ow!) Yes, it may not be on the menu, but there is a less than mild spice. The mild flavor still has a lot of kick in it so beware! \n\nI also love the lemon pepper. If you love the tasty combination of citrus, tang, and spice, I would suggest the lemon pepper. It is also the safe zone. A flavor that is sure to satisfy you if you're not sure you're ready to take the risk and commitment of spice.\n\nLastly, this joint is worthy of five stars when you throw a corn in the cob and a potatoe in the plastic shake and bake bag (shake, DON't bake). Soak those bad boys up in that sauce baby, and call that a connection! \n\nIts all about good food and experience and when you incorporate the thrill of eating off the table with no utensils or a plate (something your mother told you NEVER to do), you're sure to bring out the dangerous and adventurous side of yourself that you didn't know existed! Its a great place to take a date, especially if you want to test the daring side of them. I will be a long lived patron of Hot and Juicy. Hat tipped to you! :)\n\n(Further update when I try my Boiling Crab experience....)"

The timing of all the food coming out was a little off, but I think that will improve with them only being open a couple of months when we went.\n\nThe only bad thing for visitors is getting back to your hotel if you don't have a rental car.

If you have your own car... head west on Spring Mountain Road, and be ready for a good ol' fashioned crawfish broil..."

We were greeted by a young lady at the door and she tells us the wait time is about 45 minutes  to an hour wait. So we decided to just place an order to go (we didn't want to bother with the wait). So we ordered 2 pounds of shrimp and 2 pounds of the crawfish. It took about 30 - 50 minutes for the cooks to finish with our order. So finally we made it home, we opened up the bags and I dig IN with full force!!! Wow, the shrimp and the crawfish was full of exploding spicy flavors. Here's a tip, spoon out some of the sauce and dip your crustacean in the sauce! Its delicious! So don't get afraid of getting your hands messy!"

A lot of our crab legs were pretty skimpy on the meat tho, but we mentioned it to our server and she gave us an extra half pound. Then because it took so long to get that half pound (they were pretty busy), she changed it to an additional pound PLUS took a pound off of our bill. \nI have noticed that the service is a little inconsistent...sometimes they go above and beyond and sometimes they don't. We have had a problem with getting our drinks refilled and getting our bill split. But it really does depend on the server. Sometimes they'll say that the bill can't be split, other times it's not an issue. One thing is consistent tho - the food is always delicious!!!! I've had the crawfish, mussels, snow crab, and shrimp. Their fries are pretty delicious (I usually order a basket to dip in the sauce). Their \u00e9touff\u00e9e is also fantastic.

Another gem located way off the strip on Spring Mountain Rd which is asian food heaven from what I saw driving around.  The place was crowded which is always a good sign.  The crawfish was very fresh as I think we are nearing peak season.  Nice big juicy suckers with plenty of tail meat.  All crustaceans (crawfish, king/snow crab, dungeness crab, blue crab and shirmp) have a choice to be bathed with mild to extra spicy seasoning sauce.  The spice level is as stated.  No watering it down for the tourists.  When they mean spicy, it will be spicy.  Best to avoid the extra spicy unless you are participating in some food challenge or trying to show off.  Not really a first date kind of place but heck if you bring someone here you both should know what you are getting in to.  Parking is beyond tiny and likely you will need to park on the side street which is a little on the sketchy side.  The servers were all fun and eager to please with refills constantly coming."

You know what's there now? A couple fucking TVs. How ingenious! Why let your customers know your prices when they could instead zone out on some fucking game and ignore the people they're dining with, all while annoying a waitress by making her hold up her \"price guide\" while I decide if I want king crab or clams. \n\nBest part: there isn't even a fucking bar in front of the fucking TVs. Not that this place even needs one, but the lack of seating around these TVs proves their lack of worth even more so. \n\nIf you own this place/are a manager: lose the fucking boob tubes and try to look like a real eatery, not another jerk-off spot with 26 TVs.

The shadiest part of my dining experience here is that they use all plastic cups for drinks and water.

Big creature, small amount of meat.  1 lb of shrimp in Hot N Juicy seasoning is the way to go.  \nKeep in mind that when you order by the pound, that includes the weight of the entire shrimp body, antennas, legs, and the juice. Their seasoned fries are burn-your-face-off spicy, and with all the spice in the shrimp, I found it overwhelming. Their corn fritters are crispy, creamy, sweet balls of corny goodness.  They pair perfectly with the spicy shrimp.\n\nFor those who have children or unenthusiastic seafood eaters in your group, they also offer things like chicken strips and popcorn shrimp on their menu.\n\nOh and unless you want your fingers to burn for hours after the meal and garlic scented fingertips for the next week, WEAR THE GLOVES!"

My dear friend grubbed on them though, said he really liked em.\n\nIt was a lot of fun getting down and dirtay, and working for my food. And honestly, I would TOTALLY recommend eating here as a first date, whats a better way to get to know someone then being knee deep in delicious crawfish?"

            "review": "Hot N Juicy is one of those places that I never thought I would like.  Growing up, my relatives have always been obsessed with crab legs and other seafoods that you have to work for to get to the good stuff.  As I got older I saw that it wasn't just my family, it was pretty much everybody that was obsessed with peeling their food.  I just did not see the point in having to work so hard for your food!\n\nAnd then there was Hot N Juicy.  Admittedly, my first visit here was made reluctantly.  If I didn't care much for crab, why would I care for crawfish?  The answer is easy: the Hot N Juicy Special sauce.  Medium spice.  I went from avoiding seafood that requires my hands to eat, to getting serious cravings for Hot N Juicy.  That sauce is spicy and leaves a (pleasant) burn on your lips as you continue to eat.  The garlic flavor can get pretty strong as it leaves it's mark on your breathe, and infiltrates every article of clothing you're currently wearing.  You'll probably end up doing laundry as soon as possible.  But all of that doesn't matter...because the sauce is worth it.\n\nMy current favorite is the shrimp.  Crawfish is good, but their size is inconsistent.  Not that that's the restaurants fault or anything, it's just that the first time I went, the crawfish were pretty darn big.  But with each subsequent visit...their size diminished.  But it's okay, I have my shrimp to keep me satisfied.  Next time I go I'll have to try the crab.\n\nSo has my mind changed about seafood?  No not really.  As it stands, I'm really in it for the sauce.  No Hot N Juicy special, no seafood peeling/cracking for me.  Five stars for instilling a craving that I never thought I would have, and having consistently delicious sauce."

When the restroom ran out of soap and was a little nasty, they jumped on the cleaning. I really like the responsiveness of the staff. \n\nNow for the food, we had Alaskan King Crab($27/lb) with garlic and butter, Snow Crab($18/lb) hot and spicy style, fried shrimp with Cajun fries, and corn fritters. Everything was good. The spicy version of hot and spicy was enough to numb my lips for the first 5 minutes. Burn baby burn! We needed a few beers to quell the fires in our mouths. Don't expect fine dining. The atmosphere is extremely casual with dance/club music playing throughout, basic bench and wood chair seating, aluminum siding accents, TVs spaced out on the walls, and tank top clad young ladies and t-shirt wearing men serving the tasty food in plastic bags. \n\nSo, this is not a first date place, wouldn't be very impressive to a potential mate. But for the family, friends, or long-time mate, it's fun. Ask for the mild versions and work up to the heat ladder. I can handle straight Thai peppers and fresh Serranos. So believe me when I say they can make it hot."

I've been back every week since the first time I went, and one week I went twice.\n\nI'm not a crawfish fan.  Maybe that is why I was so hesitant.  Nonetheless, I wanted to be open minded and faced my fears.  \n\nThere was a half an hour wait and I remember thinking- this better be worth my time!  The staff is pretty friendly and accomodating so it helped my nerves while awaiting for our table.\n\nI didn't order the crawfish but I did order the Hot N Juicy medium shrimp special as well as some corn and cajun fries.  The sauce on the shrimp was spicy, buttery and garlicky goodness.  3 things I love the most.  The shrimp is placed in a big plastic bag so the shrimp soak in all the juices from the sauce, and they put the corn (on the cob) in the bag to sit in the sauce also.\n\nOMG.\n\nSOOO good!\n\nEventually tried to expand my horizons and get the crawfish, but I wasn't a fan.  That is only because they creep me out.  So I'm a bit bias.  BUT shrimp fans rejoice."

When we got there, the place was packed and a crazy line out the door, so I thought it may have decent crawfish so I decided to wait 45 mins to get seated. Anyway, once we got in there, the menu confused me because there were a million different flavors of crawfish to choose from, which is unlike anything I've ever seen; the most flavor you usually choose from in the south is if you want them extra spicy or not. There were 3 of us, so we got a few pounds of crawfish to try out, of different flavors to start, we also got fried catfish, and an order of crab legs. \n   The crawfish were surprisingly pretty tasty! But the catfish didn't taste very good at all, and the crab legs were okay, but extremely overpriced and not for a good reason. Anyway, if I'm craving crawfish again in Vegas, and have time to wait for a seat, I'd go back but I'd only order the crawfish and nothing else."

The waitresses are very sweet and pretty and all the servers and staff are beyond friendly. \n\nAs for the food, you really can't go wrong with a big ol' bag of snow crab legs and shrimp. I always get at least a dozen sausage and oysters to go with them. The sauces are out of this world good. My friend and I always get the nosebleed sauce on the side so we can just dip everything in it and use the rice on the side to cool down. It is an exhilarating experience. This place is hands down a one-of-a-kind experience for those in Vegas. I have lived here my whole life and have not found such an inexpensive restaurant that offers this kind of experience to this scale. \n\nIMPORTANT: All the claims of sanitation issues and health violations are completely FALSE! They have recently been checked by the state health department and have been cleared of all false accusations.\n\nPlease don't let a few negative words fool you on this joint.

My preference is garlic butter with no spice.  Baby spice is still a little too spicy for me.  Have had issues with their servers not relaying no spice to the kitchen properly.  There is specific verbiage to order my preference which is \"butter & minced garlic only.\"  I couldn't remember the exact verbiage but described what I wanted and the server said she knew what i was describing.  My order came out wrong & I asked to get it corrected.  The manager on duty came to my table & proceeded to lecture me about how she told me the verbiage in the past.  First of all, the servers should be trained better so they know how to accurately write an order.  BTW - My server told me she was new and still learning.  Secondly, the manager on duty should politely tell the customer the problem will be fixed and not lecture.  Its not the customers responsibility to write an order so the kitchen knows what to make.

We must have been there for close to an hour and a half, and by the time we left the place had filled up. The service was top notch throughout our entire meal. Multiple servers asking if we needed anything, constantly offering assistance, and refilling our drinks. Our waitress was as friendly as they come and really helped us through the ordering process. \n\nNow the food. We ordered all our seafood with the hot n juicy seasoning: 1 lb. crawfish (medium heat), 1 lb. shrimp (medium heat) and 1 lb. snow crab legs (spicy).  I could handle the medium level fine, but the spicy level got the nose running and the pores sweating. It added to the experience. \n\nThey will demonstrate how to properly eat a crawfish, and after an attempt or two, you will have it down no problem. Make sure to suck the juice out of the head, that is where the flavor really accumulates. What is great about this meal is the seafood comes out very fast and it's nice and hot, but it will take you a while to make your way through it all with all the peeling and cracking and talking about how great everything tastes. \n\nThe snow crab legs were amazing and we immediately ordered  pound of king crab legs when we had finished those off. The shrimp was tasty.  I even decided to bite off a few heads and they were nice a crunchy. \n\nAlthough the place is named after the crawfish, and those do have an unique flavor, I would almost stick exclusively to the crabs next time. So tasty. Unfortunately due to the oil spill they were only offering the snow and king crab legs. Normally whole crabs from the gulf region are available too.\n\nIt's a great dining experience. Fun and very tasty. Your knuckles will burn with spices and smell of garlic  for a few hours after, but that will serve as a reminder of money well spent in Vegas."

After hearing so many great things about Hot N Juicy from friends, family and chef's I was really looking forward to this place!!  I knew what it was all about before I got there.  Rolling up yer sleeves and gettin down n' dirty with pound bags of some critters of the sea......  We heeded the warnings of early yelpers and went at an off time so we didn't have to wait an hour.  We ordered crawdads, crab and shrimp.  I had never had crawfish to eat before but I had caught these lil buckaroos as a kid when my ADD would leave me catching critters in the lakes I was fishing in INSTEAD of watching my fishing pole. I was not a fan of my first crawfish experience but I don't hold that against Hot N Juicy , probably just wasn't for me.  The shrimp were average and the king crab legs were good.  The hardest thing for me reviewing Hot N Juicy was it might just not be for me.  The concept is cool but after my experience I don't want my seafood to be masked with a flavor of garlic and chile for lbs on end.  I want to taste the natural sweetness, or flavor of freshly squeezed lemon juice and allow the protein to be in the spotlight it deserves.  My two star rating isn't for the cuisine here though.  I realize it just wasn't for me.  I was more disappointed and left unsure of the cleanliness of the dining room.  I am not a neat-freak.... I knew going into this that it was dirty.  I was not expecting the table fun to extend to the walls of the restaurant though.  We were seated in a booth in the back of the restaurant that during the time of our dining had direct sunlight on the wall.  That entire wall was the spotlight of 100 different greasy, juicy paw prints that made it look like kids finger painting with crisco.  It actually pains me to leave a negative review of a restaurant that gets so many rave reviews from fellow yelpers.  Cleanliness needs to be improved dramatically.  Hot N Juicy needs to get Hot and Soapy......"

We ordered 1 lb of crawfish in medium hot&juicy sauce. After trying crawfish I learned that it's too much work for not enough meat, so never again. The hot&juicy sauce was delicious and pretty spicy. I love spicy food, but not so spicy that all you get is heat and no flavor. \n\nI prefer to order the 1 lb of shrimp with 1 dozen sausage in mild hot&juicy sauce. With a side of cajun fries. This is a winner for sure. This entire meal would cost around $30 and good for 2 people. Hot&Juicy sauce in mild has a good balance of heat and flavor. I love to let my cajun fries swim in that sauce. The h&j sauce also has the best flavor out of the other flavor options they offer. Beware tho cause the garlic and butter in the sauce will make you smell all day. By the end of the day you can still sort of smell the sauce on your fingers. \n\nI've also tried their raw oysters and you get 1 dozen for $15. It was good but the oysters are kind of small so I wouldn't really recommend it.\n\nThe calamari is ok. Cooked well. I tried dipping it into the hot&juicy sauce just because i love the sauce so much. Unfortunately it tasted too salty. The calamari is good on its own. \n\nI'm from the Bay Area so I've tried Crawdaddy's and this is way better than Crawdaddy's. Crawdaddy's sauce is watered down compared to Hot N Juicy. Crawdaddy's shrimp also looks anemic compared to Hot N Juicy. I haven't tried Boiling Crab tho."

You gotta get your hands dirty that's the fun part about this. The best is the hot and Juicy special sauce and i did enjoy that more with shrimp than Crawfish and it was just awesome with the dungeons crab, which was a little pricey but that's normal for crab. Its all in the sauce i can eat that sauce with anything, it was also great with bread more than rice. Just try this place i don't think you will be disappointed."

We had excellent service here (5 different waitstaff helping us out and refilling our iced teas, cleaning trash, feeding Derek's sugar packet habit, etc).  \n\nWe got the soft shell crab basket to start since Derek never had it before.  It was a bit overfried but tasty, and the cajun fries were tasty.\n\nFor the meal we had 1 lb hot n juicy medium shrimp, 1 lb hot n juicy spicy crawfish, 1 lb hot n juicy extra spicy crawish, and corn + potato + rice.\n\nThe conclusion: the shrimp were large, juicy, flavorful and tasty.  The spicy crawfish was our favorite - not too hot but the spice added up enough to give us that delicious burning flavor on the tongue and runny nose/watery eyes.  The flavor also was great.  The extra spicy crawfish had a nice intense spice, but the butter and overly powdered seasoning muddled the flavor.  \n\nThe corn and rice were nice \"neutralizers\" - next time we go here we would get the spicy level with anything.  A fun, messy, bib-ilicious experience!  and yes, I felt like a garlic breathing dragon all day!"

A few weeks ago, my sis recommended that me & a friend check this place out for din din. OMG, I fell head over heels in love! \n\nIt's always a good sign when you walk up to a place & there are people lined up outside the door, waiting to be seated. There was also a large number of people who placed to-go orders, so this place was jumping with business! We decided to grab a bottle of wine (Fetzer Riesling) while waiting for our table and all of the staff there were really friendly & funny. I was joking with the guy who gave us the wine before we even had a chance to sit down. LOL\n\nIt was Friday night, so like us, most of the folks dining there were already pretty tipsy (as they rightfully should be). Wheee! :-D I remember joking around with a female waitress who was serving a table full of guys about them having another round of drinks! I also interacted with our adorable server before we were seated & decided I wanted to sit in his section. I let the hostess know & she was completely cool with it. All of the fun, goofy interaction with the staff was the 2nd indicator that we were in a good location.\n\nFinally, the food. You select your seasoning, pick a spice level, & select your items. We opted for the Hot N Juicy Special (combo of Louisiana style, cajun, garlic butter, & lemon pepper), Extra Spicy (Hot Hot Hot!!!), & ordered crawfish, shrimp, lobster, & crab (hooray 4 seafood!). The crawfish comes with 1 head of corn on the cob & a red potato, so you can add additional corn & potatoes to your order as needed. All of the food comes marinated in clear plastic bags, so you literally open up the bags and dig in! Everything was seasoned & marinated to perfection! It was hot, spicy, juicy, & delicious as advertised. The service was also impeccable from the moment we stepped into the place! It was one of the server's last night there so we ended up taking silly pics in her memory since she was working instead of enjoying a moving away party. I think I ended up taking pictures with the entire staff by the time the night was done. Silly me! LMAO \n\nWe ordered shrimp, crawfish, corn, & potatoes to go for my sis since she wasn't able to make it down there with us that evening. Those leftovers were still delicious the following day. :-) I was back in Vegas this past weekend (the place was packed again on Sunday night) & ordered takeout for dinner one evening because the food is absolutely fantastic! Looking forward to eating my leftovers tonight & making plans to visit some of the other locations soon.\n\nBe sure to check this place out next time you're in town. You're sure to love it as much as I do! :-D"

We split our orders into 2, and my group ordered: \n\n- 10 pounds of crawfish, hot, Hot N Juicy special\n- 2 pounds of shrimp, hot, garlic butter\n- 1 pound of snow crab legs, hot, Hot N Juicy special\n\nEVERYTHING was flavorful, tender, and juicy.  It was definitely more \"hot\" than I had expected, (I'm used to the \"hot\" here in DC) which wasn't a bad thing at all.  Although they messed up our order of shrimp (they gave us Hot N Juicy special instead of garlic butter) and the server was very unaccomodating towards the mistake, (She asked us: \"Are you sure that's the wrong one?\") repeatedly having to ask for things, (salt and pepper and limes, gloves, cleaning out our buckets, etc.) and spilling juices on my back while cleaning up -- everything else was smooth.  I could understand that it was really busy and serving a group of 9 might have been challenging, especially because we all had different drink orders and requests.\n\nThis is definitely a \"must-try\" if you're in Vegas and love seafood!"

My friends heard of it from Man vs. Food and I thought the pictures on Yelp looked promising, so it wasn't very hard to persuade me to go. We go there a little after it opened and were welcomed very excitedly by the staff. Of course, since we were there so early, we were seated right away. We ordered the calamari, two orders of sweet potato fries, a half-dozen raw oysters, two pounds of the Hot and Juicy crawfish, one pound of the lemon pepper crawfish and three pounds of the garlic butter crawfish (my personal favorite). \n\nThe calamari was fantastic, it wasn't overly breaded like some places do it. It comes with lemon and some marinara sauce. Now I am not a fan of sweet potato fries, but my friends ordered two orders, I was bound to try one. Not only did I try ONE, I tried like ELEVEN! Haha.. they were nicely seasoned and went perfectly with the ketchup. Believe it or not, I would order them again. (Zoinks?! lol). The raw oysters were so fresh it melted in my mouth. My only complaint is that I usually add a bit of soy sauce with the lemon wedge when I shoot raw oysters and all they had was lemon. But none the less, MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH GOODNESS!!! The guests of honor to our luncheon were the crawfish. All the flavors that we had were very flavorful and delicious in their own right. However, the garlic butter was my absolute favorite, and I think everyone elses' as well. Mainly because we put in an order for two MORE pounds after killin' just the one. \n\n*BTW you can order different grades of spicyness for your food, however we ordered the Hot and Juicy special at just a mild grade of spicy juice and it was pretty intense. Even to my spicy-loving Thai mates that ate with me :).\n\nI only gave them 4 stars because they only served beer. I'll add that additional star once they start selling wine at least, but with fingers-crossed they'll someday have a full bar."

Then instead of taking care of their customers, they are sitting in the back tables talking and texting on their phones. Waited more than 30 minutes before I had to go up and ask our waiter for the bill, could not even look at me, because he was to busy texting. Had one of his buddies drop off the check with no apologies, and walks right out the door. then has the nerve to add on the tip, where if he had taken care of his customers they way he should have. He would have gotten tipped at least 30% instead of the 17% he added on. We order appetizers, we got them after our main meals, like 20 mins. later. Not happy, because I am in the same industry, but then again I know how to take care of my customers, since the tips that they are so kind to give to me helps put food on my table and a roof over my head.

They come and bags, you rip the bag open and then go at it.  It's super hot and the gloves actually helped.  I think you get the best bang for your buck with the shrimp, as the crawfish is all shell.  The crawfish heads are delicious though, smoky woodsy flavor.  However, the shrimp are the way to go, easier eating, more substance, similar flavors.\n\nMy glove did get punctured and that spicy sauce going into my paper cut was a great feeling, but not as bad as sauce going into my eye when I accidentally scratched my eye.

Dining area is small...most tables only accomodates 4 ppl at the most.  I don't recommend for small children (the garlic is really strong), they don't have a children's menu.

Ate king crab, shrimp, crawfish, sausage, chicken fingers, fries (regular and sweet potato), fried fish. All was delicious but the work you put into it seemed like a lot. Thought it was odd that a 1lb of shrimp or the experience meal were brought out in plastic bags and they don't give you plates but that's how they roll here. Waitress was nice but she just recited all the menu items to us. She also forgot to give us gloves per my request. They also were hoarding the cracker. We had to ask. How do you serve crab legs and don't provide cracker? We had 9 people and they only gave 1! We requested another and they mark the number of the table cloth. Apparently people steal the cracker or it gets wrapped up in all the shells and paper towels and accidentally thrown away. Overall good experience. If you're ok with getting messy and eating off the paper table cloth. It cost $1 for butter. I'm surprised they don't give you butter to dip the crab legs in."

To the person who loves to spread false information and to put it on this on the news is completely outright wrong! and secondly karma is a bitch cause you messed up in the first place...hate it to say it to the folks but this place is NOT going to shut down.\n\nThere will ALWAYS be dissatisfied customers no matter what! no matter what!\nHonestly,  this place is not gonna make everyone happy, i mean, what business out there does???? this IS america people! we love to complain, and all the better, we loooove to sue each others ass off!!\n\n All I can tell you is that since ive been coming here along with all the waaaaay tooooo many people i referred this place to and i rarely ever got a bad response, and only a few times i did get one its because they were either 1) don't eat seafood 2) extremely fickle picky eaters.\n\nbut this place is outstanding, and consistent, its always freaking busy! so the customer service is not always gonna be 110% on top of things, your not coming here for superb service, your coming here for seafood cajun style and  of course, if you like it \"SPICY\". if your a customer and you demand perfect food along with perfect service go take yourself to a 5 star rated michelin awarded restaurant cause theres a few here in vegas, and spend your $500  + worth of experiencing excellent dining. \n\nOther than that,  ive said what i needed to say. Nonetheless, hot and juicy, when it comes to great seafood and spice and BLUECRABS, you never fail me, you just make me and all the rest of your fans from vegas, l.a., the bay, and everyone else from all over,coming back for MORE!!!!!!!!"

Not only is the crawfish fabulous but they have the freshest oysters i have ever eaten! Always happy and unpretentious servers that are attentive, always keeping my drink filled. I will keep wrestling with the dilemma of spreading the word of this place but afraid that too many people that know about it will ruin it. Last time i was there i overheard a couple of ignorant patrons complaining, obviously they have no idea what good taste is. Can't fix unsophisticated taste palates. Let them eat elsewhere, perhaps a hamburger chain. We will continue to patronize as long as they are open!!!"

It's filled with the spice that you chose, corn on the cob and a potato. What makes these craw fish so good is the seasonings used. There's a few different flavor choices. I always get the special. It's all of the flavors together. Then there is the Spice level. Beware! Spicy is Spicy! I have yet to try the Extra Spicy. There are no utensils or plates. You eat off the plastic table cloth and you even get a bib. I was never a fan of craw fish until now. One of my favorite places in Vegas."

I ordered all my food in hot n juicy medium sauce and when I got it the sauce was as thin as water. It used to be thicker and would coat your food, it was delicious. Unfortunately with the extremely thin sauce it didn't coat anything and wasn't as flavorful. The crawfish was over cooked and the 2 lbs of clam was more shells than clams. If this were my first experience here, I'd never return. This has happened a few times at this original location. The waitress was also very annoying trying to take my fries away when I wasn't even done with them, she did this 3 times, I practically had to shove the rest in my mouth so I didn't have to tell her not to take the basket again. She also forget to get my drink and I had to go to the register and ask someone else if they could get my drink. When I asked the waitress why the food has changed and she was rude and said she didn't know and maybe it happened with a new chef and gave me a dirty look. This was a very disappointing  trip."

We figured we had frozen crawfish before ... if the sauce is good, everything will be ok. NOTHING WAS GOOD.\n1) The crawfish was crumbly. I expected some toughness or flakiness from it being frozen, but this was just nasty. A bunch must have been dead before they were frozen. \n2) The sauce was NOT JUICY. It did not make me want to lick my fingers or suck the crawfish head. Too salty and pungent.\n3) The corn was either overcooked or it was bad frozen corn. The kernels were tiny and prune-like. \n\nThe only think I liked about the place was the fried chicken wings. Those were definitely HOT & JUICY, but I didn't go there for crawfish.

So don't dress to impress, just bring something to cover yourself. :D\nTheir ordering process is simple: Just order the choice of seafood, seasoning, level of spicy and add-ons. The Hot N Juicy special seasoning is absolutely fabulous. It's like a combination of  Cajun, black pepper and lots of garlic, so you got lots of flavor in one bag. The spice level is more like those you will find in a Thai restaurants, so when you pick spicy, it is really spicy. Make sure you order POTATOES as add-ons, it well pick up all the sauces and juices in the bag and you will be in potato heaven. \nWe ordered 2lbs crawfish, 0.5lbs shrimp, extra corn and potato in Hot N Juicy special seasoning and spicy. With two drinks it only cost us about 26 dollars. So it not only the best taste you will find in Vegas it will also be the best value in Vegas."

We love the crab, so sweet and meaty, even the snow crab. The sausage is perfect, crisp skin and just the right amount of spice. The etouffee is yummy, it actually tastes like the one I had in New Orleans. The fries are good, not really spicy though.  We never had the lobster there, just figured crab was their thing.  My only issue is the explanation of the spice level is sort of off. I can eat very spicy food, but for some reason, maybe due to the messiness, I get cuts all over my mouth from the peppers. On my second visit, I even downgraded the spice level, but yet again the same occurrence. I tend to now stay close to mild. Maybe I have sensitive skin, I don't know. Never the less, it's always a very good meal. But we have had better now. Don't get me wrong it's awesome food. Service is hit or miss. They are just so busy. But even really busy I have had an awesome male server.\n\nThese are my negatives 1.) What is up with the tiny, tiny plastic ramekin for all those fries?? Seriously? Every time I go I have to ask for ketchup like 6 times and every single time (with exception of that awesome guy server we had) they bring 1 tiny, tiny ramekin. I don't consider myself the queen of common sense but I feel like I am dealing with servers that might not have the sense of urgency and common sense gene! If you are busy, wouldn't you just say  \"F it, let me bring her the freaking bottle, because I don't have time for crazy ketchup lady!! \" ?\n\nBut no, again comes that plastic ramekin of 1 tablespoon of ketchup. Oh, OK I have calmed down, please excuse my rant. I guess I didn't realize how upset I was about the ketchup, I will get over it and move on. ( I don't mean to offend any of those servers they do work hard and service really isn't bad) Plus, I haven't been there in a few months, so maybe things have changed.\n\nNegative #2) The seating is a little congested for my liking. Tables are way to close together. I do understand it's a small place, so it's to be expected. But for me, when I want to relax and enjoy a meal this venue isn't appetizing to me.\n\n3.) 2 restrooms, again it's limited spacing so I understand. But it doesn't mean I like it. And no bar to wait until your table is ready. Maybe I am spoiled. I don't like sitting, if you are lucky to get a seat ,Like I am waiting for a bus outside.\n\nWell, in conclusion, is it good food.? Yes it's great! I chose to come here when the negatives are not going to bother me. When I am hungry and want to grub and I don't care who sees or what I see!"

I doubt very much that they use live crawfish. My son had just one pound at $10.99. He got a bad stomach ache shortly after. He said that the frozen crawfish we buy (in a pinch) at the restaurant depot were much better."

Be prepared to come out smelling like what you just ate as our uber driver noticed it but he said he loved the smell lol wonder what everyone else though as we walked the stripped after our meal.\n\nI ordered the 1lb blue crab, 1 lb crawfish and dozen oyster shooters hot n juicy style in mild. The prices here are crazy cheaper than places like rockin' crawfish and hang ten boiler here in the bay area and surprisingly tasted way better (funny how we got better crawfish in the dessert than back at home). The flavor of the sauce was amazing with chunks of minced garlic and the amazing flavor of cajun spices with a hint of sweetness and i just wish they gave you more sauce to go with your food.\n\nThe Blue crab was crazy cheap and we lucked out with 3 female crabs with eggs (YUM!) a little under cooked but cooked enough as the meat was a little mushy. If you order the blue crab be prepared to really get your hands dirty as they give you the whole crab and you have to pry the head off (which i don't mind and every time i eat at crawfish spots i don't use gloves so my fingers end up smelling for a week or so haha). The crawfish was perfectly boiled and the tail came out perfectly and was the highlight of my meal. The Oyster was a bit disappointing as they were really large in size and it had no flavor on the oyster or the juices. It tasted like they pried the oysters open then rinsed it in water.\n\nThe staff was just amazing and really efficient in their roles. Our server was attentive and checked on us regularly. She made sure to keep us in the know about our meal (she said our order will come as they cook and that the crab will come last as it take a while to cook), when our drinks were running low she would swoop in to refill our beverage. \n\nHighly recommended spot if you're in Vegas"

I saw this joint on Travel Channel & being a fan of Louisiana  Style Crawfish...it was mandatory that we hit up this place. \n\nThe Crawfish were GINORMOUS & tasted pretty good. Could've used more seasoning, but it was  pretty decent considering the size of their Brown River Crawfish. I'd say the crawfish & the sauce here is tastier than Boiling Crab, but I still like Crab Hut much better. If Crab Hut served these steroid induced crawfishes...I'd be there prepared for high cholesterol. \n\nCustomer service kinda sucked cuz we ordered Calamari, which never came out...even after several reminders. Other than that everything else was great...we will be coming back the next time we're in Vegas & will continue to tell our friends about this place."

We arrived VIP style only to find out that even VIPs had to wait too -- this is a first come, first served basis -- which means 45 mins. wait for our party of 13 on a Friday night.  We were absolutely starving by the time we got seated.\n\nI was excited to see my Hot N Juicy mild 2 lb. crawfish come to the table.  It was served steaming hot in a plastic bag and it includes potato and corn.  It certainly lived up to its name, I was sweating bullets and constantly reaching for my cup of water -- 3 COLD cups -- to tame the hotness in my mouth.  I was with a bunch of Thai folks so you know they have had their share of SPICY food growing up and even they were crying!  but of course, they didn't listen to our server when she warned them, so they ordered it HOT anyway and boy, I saw grown men in tears!\n\nA solid four stars for the taste, for the experience of getting down and dirty and for such great friendly service.  However, my two pounds of crawfish even with a side of Cajun fries (also spicy!) still left me craving for more substantial food.  The damage came up to $31 with tip which is pricey indeed but I guess this leaves room in your tummy for the after party!"

We got both shrimp and crawfish, one with the hot 'n' juicy, and one with the lemon pepper. \n\nThe crawfish were incredible. The meat was sweet, with a bit of a floral fragrant aftertaste. I have a friend who swears by crawfish, but I didn't know why until now. We could also de-vein the crawfish just by tugging on the tail of the shell after breaking off the head. I had no idea that was possible, and call me odd but it added an element of fun to the experience. The shells were also thinner than I've previously experienced - I just wanted to crunch into them after carnally tearing off the heads. Talk about bringing out my inner beast.\n\nThey give you salt and pepper for dip, and also some lime/lemon. Tip from my boyfriend: instead of using just a sprinkling, ask for a ton of limes/lemons, and fill one of the little containers with the juice. Then, load it with the salt and pepper. It gives you a flavor option besides the spicy, buttery sauce, and kinda cuts through the grease. That way, you can endlessly rotate between pungent and rich, and citrusy sweet.\n\nThe waitress also wrote \"Thank You\" on our receipt. A great, friendly touch. I'll be coming back here whenever I'm in Vegas."

Do you want to pay this really pretentious \"Market Price\" on seafood that's been floating in a metal bucket of lukewarm water for a week?  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming ...\n\nOverall -\n\nAbsolutely horrid is all I can say.  Food - minus one star.  Service - minus one star. Overall experience - Minus 2 stars.\n\n\nDetails - 8-24-2015 6:30 p.m.\n\nWe ordered two pounds of shrimp in H n' J sauce from medium to spicy.  The wait staff was indifferent except for the hostess who seemed at least partially aware that she was a paid employee.  The single male service person behind the counter was more concerned with chatting up his fellow female coworkers than taking our order, which i nearly shouted that we were ready to give (yet still ignored).  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue... \n\nThe order taker insisted that I give her my telephone number, which I refused to do.  She stated that it was company policy because some people leave without paying.  Wait.  This was a pre-paid to-go order how could I even do that?  I gave her a number and she took my order.  Order came out promptly.  Paid 40+ bucks for two pounds of seasoned shrimp, 8 wings and an order of Corn Fritters.  Whatever.  Not a great value but not a rip-off I suppose.\n\n\nEating It - \n\nGot home and opened my take out order and I have to say we did not, could not finish eating what was given to us because of several things:\n\n\n- Market price?  Honestly I've had fresher shrimp at the Palms Casino buffet.  Hot and Juicy adjusts the price of their offerings based on market price of goods.  An upscale restaurant can justify \"Market Price\" when they are obtaining fresh ingredients on the day of service.  Hot and Juicy is certainly not an upscale restaurant obtaining fresh ingredients on the day of service.  In my view, the price the customer pays should get discounted, because the seafood we got on 8-24-2015 was dicey to say the least, and likely unfit for consumption.  Really? Do you want to pay this really pretentious \"Market Price\" on seafood that's been floating in a metal bucket of lukewarm water for a week?  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue... \n\n- Consistency of the shrimp in the same bag ranged from firm and fresh to powdery and obviously turned.  The majority of the shrimp we peeled were expired and belonged in the bin.  On whole I would say that the most of the batch was powdery, expired shrimp that were not kosher to serve.  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue...   \n\n- They do not clean the gut-line of the shrimp!  Did you know that it may be possible to contract Hepatitis from improperly cleaned shrimp?  I understand that if they want to leave the shrimp peel and eat they can leave the shell on, but don't insult your customers by leaving the the bowels and their contents in the meal.  At least butterfly the top and remove the gut-line before boiling.  Sheesh!  Please tell me.  Would you want a beef steak with the guts hanging out on your plate when it is served?  \"Oh well this is the way it's usually done.\"  Bullshit!  How is this acceptable?  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue... \n\n-  The Corn Fritters, at 5.99 an order were just disgusting, greasy lumps of uncooked dough with corn pieces in them.  Disappointing and in a word, Inedible.  I don't know if they are forced to do this or what but, someone at the restaurant wrote on the the Styrofoam containers \"Corn Fritters, YUM!\"  Really?  IDK.  Have you ever felt embarassed for someone else though it has nothing to do with you?  \"Corn Fritters.  YUM?\"  No.. Just no.  \n\nWarning -\n\nI don't know who owns this place and I have no grudge or anything like that.  It was just really, really bad.\n\nPictures coming up tomorrow morning when my wife decides to email me the pics.\n\nnota bene - They have chicken nuggets on the menu for nine bucks or so that are frozen and pre-cooked.  Did not order for my son at home that does not like seafood.  I'm so tired of low quality restaurant food.  When did TGIFriday set the Gold Standard for restaurants?  I don't eat out anymore unless I can be sure that the food tastes better than what I make at home.  Hot and Juicy did not deliver value for your dollars.  \n\n{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{AVOID}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\n\n\nPEACE!\n\n\nDAVE"

After hearing from so many friends, family, and coworkers how awesome this place was I decided to go and take some family from out of town. I am originally from the east coast so I am a bit spoiled on GREAT seafood. All the people telling me to go here are all from California or some other pacific coast state. Now I can understand why someone from the desert or west coast would like this place because they don't know any better but let me tell you, THIS PLACE WAS AWFUL. I could not believe how bland the seafood was especially with all the rave reviews of the sauces this place uses. The sauces are all extremely watered down and they do not penetrate to the actually food itself just the shells. We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of crawfish (which we were told were not fresh but frozen!!!), a dozen oysters(SO BAD), and calamari. We tried various sauces and spice levels and we just agreed that this place was a lot of hype for nothing. I have been to the Gulf many times and have had the type of food they are TRYING serve and the food here is just not even close. I did ask the manager where the seafood comes from and he told me ASIA mostly(FYI, seafood restaurants that get their shellfish from Asia are normally awful plus it's the cheapest possible shellfish on the market!!!). I guess I understand why the location is in China town and why most of the people at the restaurant were Asian. In addition to the food tasting awful, the service was very poor. Staffed with a lot of girls who seemed to be working their first serving job. We had to light signal flares just to get another beer. All the wait staff was talking about some party after work that they couldn't wait to get to and they kept grouping together to discuss rather than tend to the customers and lots of people were frustrated. Don't get me wrong, I can totally see how people who have never had decent seafood (mostly from buffets) would love this place as it's just like people who say the best sushi is at Ra Sushi because they just don't know any better. But if you have been to cities on the Gulf of Mexico and have had Gulf seafood or are from the east coast and have had great seafood then please pass this place up because all your friends telling you how awesome this place is have never truly had awesome seafood."

The most egregious offense was the fact that they ran out of crawfish. Who wants to go to a seafood boil spot that is out of crawfish. Unfortunately I've got to deduct a star. Now to the food, I ordered the hot and juicy shrimp medium spicy, mussels hot and juicy style, Cajun fries, and fried calamari. \nThe Cajun fries were just fries with seasoning thrown on them. I didn't like them very much and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. \n2/5 stars\n\nThe fried calamari were small and forgettable. I will stick to the boil from now on.\n1/5 stars.\n\nThe boil was great! The shrimp boil was a great blend of seasonings and none of the different components over powered the others. It wasn't too salty or garlicky like Boiling Crab. This place really does seafood right. \n4/5 stars.\n\nThe conclusion: This is a wonderful little gem of a seafood place. I plan to come back for crawfish boil soon, so I plan to update my review."

This place, the little guys were big enuf that you could pull the meat out with minimal effort. Ive been to places where you sit there peeling back the shell and when you're done, the meat is almost gone because it got squished between your fingers and gets lost in a boatload of shells.\n\nThe seasoning is good, although a bit oily from the butter. The spices left me out of commission the next morning but  was worth it at the time.\n\nWe also ordered the King Crab which tasted OK but it definietly wasnt fresh. You can tell it was frozen stored because the shell was soft and stale when it came to our table.  When you peeled the shell off, a lot of water came gushing out.\n\nFor $20 something a pound, we expected fresh.  \n\nAll in all, it was a fun experience we thank Adam Richman for telling us about.\n\nBTW, they need to move that dumpster full of rotting crawfish leftovers away from the part of the building thats visible. The sweltering vegas desert heat doesnt help much either. The smell after leaving the restaurant was mortifying."

The food was great (4 stars) but the service earned that extra fifth! If you do one food adventure in Vegas this is it!\n\nI went at about 7 on a Saturday, and let me say the place was packed, I would definitely be more strategic next time!  But despite being run ragged, their whole staff were friendly, helpful, and attentive! They told me it would be about 20 minutes for a table, so when I got one in 15 I was quite happy!\n\nTimothy, our server, was amazing.  Despite obviously having a lot on his plate he took the time to really go in depth with me about all of my questions when he found out it was my first time. He even put on a pair of gloves when we got our food and gave us a step by step on how to demolish our respective crustaceans!   Checked on us many times, made sure glasses were full, and gave us quite a few valuable honest opinions.   I wish I could have Timothy at every resturaunt!\n\nThe food!  DELICIOUS.  At Timothy's suggestion we had hot n juicy sauce on our crawfish and lemon pepper on our king crab and shrimp. Definitely the right choices!  I had the crawfish and crab mild level spicy, and I like spice!  It was definitely the right heat.  My partner had hers \"less than mild\", which is their secret lowest spice level, and for her sensitive palate it was perfect!  \n\nOrder a variety, the crawfish is fun but not filling.   The king crab was great, but pricey, next time I'll stick to regular crab.    If you don't have them throw a corn on the cob in each bag you are cheating yourself, some of the best corn I've ever had.  The sauces are amazing, I definitely recommend asking your server what pairs best with each seafood.   The hot n juicy is awesome, but definitely spicier even t the same heat level.\n\nIf they open a HnJ in northern Cali, I hope the staff here considers moving out here! XD it'd be a privilege to eat with them again!"

Maybe my experience was a fluke?\n\nI came here around 8pm, and waited for around 40 minutes for a table. There were a few tables that cleared up quickly, but the staff didn't clean it up immediately... so the 40 minute wait could have been more of a 25-30 minute wait. They also have a strong garlicky yummy smell in the air which made the wait felt worse.\n\nOrdered 2lbs of shrimp, 2lbs of crawfish, 1 bag of king crab legs and some Cajun fries in their special spicy hot and juicy seasoning. I felt that their Cajun fries are over seasoned... Quite salty... Their shrimp was the best out of everything, but the shrimp was just okay. The crawfish wasn't juicy as their restaurant name would lead one to believe... Maybe it's not fresh that day??? The king crab legs felt rough and overcooked... and it was the blandest one of all... \n\nThe service here was not very good. My group had to flag waiters multiple times to get bibs, crackers, gloves, drinks, refills. I eventually gave up and just walked up to the register to ask for these items... The decor here really sucks too, very dim, simple, and at times looks quite questionable regarding sanitation... I will not be coming back. I personally love the boiling crab much more."

Yet, we were seated, given menus, then as we attempted to order we were informed that they are not currently serving crawfish. The item they are known for! UNACCEPTABLE! We came here for the crawfish, thats what we wanted, so why would we order something else. The waitress expanded that they just received a shipment so their crawfish are frozen. First off, hearing frozen was a huge turn off. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area so our seafood here is FRESH. Yet I had to remind myself that Vegas is in the desert so fresh seafood here is unlikely. \n\nWe rolled our eyes and blew the joint. I swear I would be back but for the rest of the day I was getting puppy eyes from the honey so I agreed to give them a second try and attempt dinner.\n\nWe arrived again at 5:30 and we were seated after 10 minutes. We ordered a pound of Hot & Juicy Special in Medium and one pound of shrimp in Garlic Butter medium and a side of sweet potato fries. First off there is not one positive thing that I can recall about the fries so I would recommend ordering a bowl of rice instead. Yes, order rice over fries. I never thought I would recommend that to anyone. Ever.\n\nMy favorite flavor was the Hot & Juicy! It was packed with flavor and mighty tasty! The Garlic Butter was good too! I would both order them again. The heat levels here though are a little off, if you want hot, order medium, etc. I would beware the extra spicy! \n\nThe place got pretty crowed around 6:20 and I was happy we arrived fairly early. The service here is lagging. You have to notify your waiter(ess) if you want more water. They don't really pay attention the details. \n\nI would go back if I lived there and needed a crawfish fix, but on my next Vegas trip or any after I will not be visiting Hot and Juicy. It was good, but it wasn't THAT good. \n\n(I took off a star for not having crawfish when I went initially FYI)\n\nOH and yes, my paws smelled 2 days after. The amount of soap didn't matter. The order sinks in! Kinda yucky.\n\nHappy ripping off the heads of crawfish! \n\n(="

At the beginning, the service was good until I guess they got more people and then our service was basically nonexistent... The water refill game was not on point. We had a party of 7 and our server was the guy with the man bun (forgot his name).\n\nThe food:\nCrawfish isn't in season so frozen crawfish is all they had. Fresh crawfish is normally $11.99 and frozen was $7.99 (which isn't that cheap IMO since i've had frozen crawfish at other places for $5.99). Two pounds of crawfish gives you free potato and corn. My friend ordered 2 pounds and added 6 sausages for $3. The sausages were sliced pretty thinly but they were decent. \n\nI opted out for clams, spicy and hot n juicy style. I underestimated the spicy because I underestimate spicy at a lot of places. This place threw a good kick and I'm satisfied with the level of spice. My friends ordered the mild and the baby spice and they complained that they weren't mild enough or baby spice enough. My 1 lb of clams was $10.99 (market price at the time). I also ordered the cajun fries and made sure they were spicy. He says that the cajun fries are spicy by default. I was content with the fries while my baby spice and mild friends complained that they were spicy. The fries also had a nice kick to it. \n\nMy friend got a half dozen of oysters ($9.99). They were small and did not taste very fresh. They weren't the woooorst oysters I've ever had but they were far from being the best. \n\nFinal notes:\nGloves and bibs are provided. Ask for salt, pepper and lime for a good dipping sauce. The table is able to be split amongst 3 tabs and each tab can be split amongst different forms of payment. \n\nOverall, I haven't tried the Boiling Crab in Vegas yet but I'm pretty content with the Hot N Juicy location in Vegas. The ones I've tried in California weren't the greatest."

Good because you can be helped by the server who is closest to you no matter who they are, and bad because you don't really have a set server for your table checking in on you as often. Overall, definitely a place you have to check out off the strip if you're ever in Vegas."

I just had to have...aaah, crawfish.  I would say that is the closest I could get myself to transporting my state of mind in my good ole' neighborhood in the South. Since lived there, and having crawfish and alligator meat as Southern fare, crawfish became my last Sunday's dinner. \n\nThe smell of garlic, pepper and spice filled my nostrils upon entering. Windows brought in the early evening light as we walked in this cozy restaurant with its simple dining set-up. Rows of wooden chairs and white plastic-covered tables. Each table had a roll of paper towel. Television perched high up on one wall. Not much talking around, diners were busy.... \n\nMet by a smiling male waitstaff, and got a seat and table by the wall. Menu was simple in a rectangular paper. I knew what I liked. What else? but crawfish! I yearn for the days I would buy them from a seafood grocer in North Carolina and take it home to steam & boil it in my gigantic steamer-boiler pot. I am great at cooking crawfish. My kitchen has a rollaway spice rack filled with spices, stainless steel cookwares and stainless steel range-oven...I like making seafood and crawfish for myself and whenever I have guests. \n\nBut this time, this restaurant cooks it for me. Order the crawfish or  seafood by the pound..or two...or three...as much you like. Also indicate the type of spice and amount of spiciness. The waitstaff pleasant and helpful about anything unclear about the spiciness. If you care to ask about how to peel off the crawfish meat from the shell, the waitstaff will show you how. But I do know how, so let me say that I am hands-up, thumbs-up delighted when the crawfish I ordered came in a plastic bag inside a bucket. It was pulled out of the bucket and presented to me and my Mom. It was steaming Hot-and-Juicy! just like the restaurant is called. The aroma was invigoratingly intoxicating! But stop! one thing I just have to do. \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness\" so where else would I go before all this? The bathroom awaits for a good hands cleansing. Did that so fast! Yes, hands where the main activity going in this restaurant. Everyone was just eating away with hands! Diners were busy! By golly, this is a feastful of fun! The crawfish was extrasuperfantastically delicious! Well made, not too dry! There was sauce inside the plastic bag. Spicy, it was especially my request of Louisiana Hot and Spicy Special was definitely the spiciness it supposed to be, just like in the South! Small chunks of garlic and ginger were visible as part of the seasoning. Besides the crawfish, the oysters on their half-ed oyster shells (my favorite!) were large and fresh. With sprinkling of lemon juice and butter sauce gave it the \"to-die-for\" yumminess. Also, the crab legs (presented steaming in a plastic bag) was remarkably meaty. A side order of corn was drenched with garlic and butter with a little spiciness of Creole seasoning. Oh, corn-soft-ness!\n\nAlas, this is a place for hands-on eating for juicy seafood! My Mom and I was delightfully full and messy. Yes, there were splashes of red on our bibs and table cover from the Creole-Cajun-Louisiana sauce but no cares. The table covers gets trashed by the waitstaff after each table is vacated. There's water in the bathroom, just go wash those hands! But will surely go back for more hot and juicy sea eats!"

We have similar types of crawfish joints like Hot N Juicy but I haven't found any place I really love yet. Oh and watch out, you will have major garlic breath after leaving here. Def. recommend checking this place out if you haven't."

When we arrived there were only a table or two dining which got us worried since we're used to boiling crab always being packed. As we were overlooking the menu I noticed that they serve blue moon, which deserves extra brownie points! \n\nWe ordered 2 pounds of the shrimp in their hot n' juicy sauce which is a combination of all their sauces, cajun fries, and an order of rice. [FYI: you can't order half pounds here ]The food took quite a while to come out, but once we got to eating we noticed that the shrimp were wayyy over cooked. The skin and heads of the shrimp were falling off, and some pieces of shrimp were definitely too soft for my liking. We were probably only able to get through a pound-if that, of our order. But their sauce weren't too bad, definitely better than most places I've tried, but definitely doesn't live up to boiling crab's whole shabang sauce. \n\nAll in all, this place isn't bad; if I'm ever in Las Vegas having major shrimpas cravings I wouldn't mind coming back."

However, anytime I'm craving some cajun in Vegas, this would definitely be the place I would go to.  \n\nI came by with my parents when we were visiting Vegas over winter break cause my dad is a seafood fanatic and loves any form of seafood.  We started with some oysters which were shucked off the shell and came with plenty of lemon and Tabasco on the side.\n\nWe also had the hot n juicy shrimp with extra garlic which was fantastic, but not as spicy as I'm used to from Cajun Corner.  \n\nThe crawfish was also well seasoned and had a bit more meat than I expected which was a big bonus.  \n\nMy dad had the softshell crab which came with cajun fries although there wasn't that much cajun seasoning on them which was a bit disappointing because the seasoning was deliciously spicy and salty.\n\nThe corn was alright, only because it somehow didn't soak up the juice as it does at Cajun Corner (maybe I'm just biased)\n\nThe reason that I'm willing to give this place five stars despite a few minor preference issues is that the wait staff is great.  The waitress who took our order was fantastic, very nice and somehow managed to memorize all of the things that we ordered with modifications and had it all come out correctly.  That was impressive enough in my book considering that our ordered included different levels of spice, amounts of garlic and there was just a bunch of stuff to memorize.  \n\nI will definitely be back when the craving for cajun in Vegas strikes"

NOT SO HOT AND JUICY!\n\nMy friend recommended this place because her cousin saw it on the Food Network.  I want to go to Food Network, tell them that they SUCK, that they should retract the special on Hot and Juicy, and that they should do a special on Boiling Crab instead.  Okay, maybe not as harsh.\n\n- We all ordered the shrimp with the Medium Hot and Juicy Special sauce.  At BC, you can see the garlic, pepper, and the deep red sauce in the bag.  Also,  the Medium Whole Shabang has a spicy taste that lingers.   This is what I was expecting.  Instead, the shrimp at H&J came out super bland, not spicy, and not juicy at all.  I had to squish my shrimp around the barely-there sauce to get it to have any flavor at all.\n\n- We had to ask for limes, salt, and pepper.  They took forever to get the limes out to us.  It was as if they went to go buy limes and cut them up just for us.\n\n- You can't draw on the walls.  How wack is that? Haha.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and the venue was clean, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.  I'm sorry H&J...  2 stars for you cuz: \"Meh.  I've definitely experienced better.\""

Hot N' Juicy has really nice, good quality seafood. Tried the shrimp and king crab. Both were very good, fresh, juicy, good seasoning. \n\nThe main difference I saw in this place and Boiling Crab was the space and the wait. Waited about 20 minutes to be seated on a Monday night. Also the interior is a bit small and cramped. That means when it is full its quite loud and you have people sort of packed in all around you. Add in the music and it can get pretty loud. Also, can be sort of weird to have a big crowd of waiting people watching you as you eat. On the other hand the service was incredibly friendly. They greeted us immediately upon entering and our server was very good. Give Emeli a raise!\n\nOverall, not much of a difference between the two besides the space and noise level. Hot N' Juicy seems to have good quality seafood, good service, decent prices (perhaps a tad more than Boiling Crab). Really just depends on your preferred location and whether you mind the wait."

So this is what everyone's been raving about. \"I mean, how good can buttered-up crustaceans really be for people to wait in line for long periods of time?\" I wondered to myself as I waited in line, albeit I expected a wait for a party of 14 or so. For people who like to get their hands dirty and have an affinity for head on crustaceans, Hot N Juicy is 5 stars for sure. \n\nFor me, however, I don't like to get my hands dirty (especially under my fingernails), and I prefer my crustacean to be deveined and decapitated before I devour them. Nevertheless, I must say I enjoyed Hot N Juicy. I ordered a pound of shrimp in the signature Hot N Juicy special sauce, medium-level spicy. If you order two pounds or more, you get corn and potatoes thrown in the bag. I wish they would include corn and potatoes with one pound orders though...\n\nWith plastic gloves on and paper towels laid out in front of me, I opened the bag of shrimp and spicy steam, and grabbed a shrimp. The worst part about this experience (other than the mess) is cleaning the shrimp before eating. It takes a long time. But I guess it's good to eat slow. The best part about this Hot N Juicy experience is the sauce. The sauce is so tasty- savory, buttery, spicy, garlicky, etc. Make sure to generously dip the meat in the sauce. The sauce is 5 stars, but the shrimp are probably worthy of 3. While some of the shrimp were plump and firm (a sign of freshness), some others were kind of mushy (a sign of age). I detest mushy shrimp!\n\nWhat would make Hot N Juicy perfect is if they offered complimentary bread to sop up the delicious sauce that comes with your seafood order. That would be cajun heaven right there!"

            "review": "Hot n' Juicy is an old favorite of mine located on Spring Mountain between Decatur and Jones. Hot n' Juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. Sometimes when I give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. Besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. How can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and Cajun seasonings?\n\nToday I ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). We both asked for the Hot n' Juicy special seasoning, extra spicy! You are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - Louisiana Style, Juice Cajun, Garlic Butter, or Lemon Pepper. Besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order dungeness crab, blue crab, king crab, or shrimp.\n\nThe first time I had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. I remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. At Hot n' Juicy it's a little different, but not much. You are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. They bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. When you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. This is where the fun starts. Crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. First you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. Then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. If this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. They supply you with crab crackers, but Ian and I agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. Whatever you decide to get, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nIf you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the Cajun fries ($2.99). These came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. We managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. Who would have thought that you could make French fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? I guess Europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so I don't feel too guilty or out of line.\n\nBy the time you are finished, it looks like Hurricane Katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. This is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try Hot n' Juicy almost any other time."

We only lived in Louisiana for 2 1/2 years but that's long enough to know about some good southern food! \nMy husband and I got the same thing; 2 pounds of Crawfish with Spicy Cajun (Louisiana Style, Garlic Butter and Lemon Pepper) flavoring with medium spice level. I myself noticed the spice level in the corn since we had the corn and potato added to the bag's of Crawfish. Medium was even spicier than what we ever had in Louisiana, but the waiter did inform us to go down a level of what we were used to. \nThe Crawfish was pretty good all in all. My husband and I both only had about 5 good sized Crawfish in each of our bags, maybe since it's off season. So that was a disappointment. I wish that they would clean the the Crawfish before they cook them. It's not fun looking at a Crawfish that looks like it still has dirt and sand on it.....ya ya ya I know their called mud-bugs but still. I know that would take some time for them to do but it just looks better. Your going to a Crawfish joint not a Chinese Buffet with Crawfish. \nIt was kinda pricey since we're used to paying a couple bucks a sack in Louisiana, granted here they are the ones taking the time to boil them. During off season with live Crawfish (the waiter said some night's they're frozen) it worked out to be about $10-$11per pound. (On the menu for Crawfish it does say market price, the waiter said during season it might be about $8 per pound) They don't have a kids menu so we had to pay $7.50 for our 3 year old daughter to get a chicken nugget's and fries basket. For all 3 of us we got a total of 4lbs. Crawfish, 2 extra corn's, chicken and fries basket, 1 soda and 2 water's and our bill was $65.00 before tip. We will try to get back before we move out of state this summer but we are also planning on having some shipped in from Louisiana and doing our own Crawfish boil so we'll see. If we were staying here in Vegas I'm sure we would go back. \n\nI"

I asked why it was a red color (garlic and butter are not red) and the server wouldn't tell me specifics and just said it was a Cajun spice blend.

Oh, let's not forget a basket of Cajun fries to share. Let's just say we were both sweating! The waiter said the spice level can vary based on the cook and my guess is the cook that night was heavy handed. We both enjoyed it, however, the service wasn't that great due to the crowd. The waitress apologized but I told her it was okay because we came for the food and not the service.\n\nThe second time we came we ordered the same thing only my boyfriend also got 1lb of blue crab. The food was once again great! The service was better and I am guessing it was because we came during lunch rather than the evening. The only thing I will say about the blue crab is that if you are not a professional at eating full crabs you may want to start with crab legs first. I watched my boyfriend eat it for the first time and it just seemed like so much work!\n\nOverall I definitely recommend this place to anyone! I have never ate at another location so I can't speak for the others. I prefer this one because it is the original.

            "review": "ate here yesterday with the hubby. place wasn't packed which was good for us. i saw some tables needed cleaning. so the waiter asked us to have a seat while he cleaned a table for us. we waited for like maybe 10 mins thinking he forgot about us or maybe he decided to clean ALL the tables before seating us? a waitress walked by and the hubby said something. she was apologetic n sat us right away. she took our order right away. we ordered 4 lbs of the hot & juicy special crawfish. came out right away, looked and smelled good! the crawfish were  big but you can tell some of them were dead before being cooked.  we had to ask for bibs and i noticed so did a few other people. so i duno if it's given upon request or what. i thought it was nice that they had gloves available upon request for the non messy eaters. the crawfish was just ok. i ordered medium and it was SPICY!!! and too garlicky for me. it was hard to get past the very spicy n garlicky taste to be able to taste any other flavors. they checked on us a couple of times which was nice. but at the end when we wanted to check out no one  paid  attention and we were just sitting  waiting. i saw a few other tables waving their hands trying to get someone's attention. finally i said the heck with this i got up n when to the cashier and paid for my food. i don't care to come back here. but if i'm in vegas again and am dying for a crawfish fix maybe just maybe i'll come back. hopefully the service will have improved!!"

            "review": "So I just flew into Vegas tonight and pretty much headed straight here after checking into my hotel. What can I say, I was fiending. While I was a little skeptical reading some of the reviews from loyal Boiling Crab fans (because honestly, who doesn't love BC), I decided to give it a shot. So, let me reiterate that I have been to both Boiling Crab and Hot n Juicy, and each has their pros and cons. I personally think they stack up pretty well (and I have reviewed both).\n\nPros for Hot n Juicy:\n\n1. Wait time was less than 10 minutes for a table for 2. It was a \"slow\" night for them (Monday) around 8ish but there was enough space to sit while waiting. While we were waiting, C and I searched their wall of Polaroids for Adam Richman's...of course, he had his own frame.\n\n2. Wait staff was friendly. Our server Amanda was excellent. She checked in with us frequently and let us know that the kitchen was closing and asked if we wanted any more food before then. After it was kind of cooled down a little (we were one of the last to leave) she came over and talked to us and we bonded over our dogs. I think that their wait staff is WAY nicer than BC's. They say hi as soon as you walk in the door...and they smile. Who'd have thought.\n\n3. Price is pretty good. After reading previous reviews, we decided to skip the crawfish, and we got 2 pounds of shrimp (with their version of BC's \"whole shabang\" sauce) with sausage (which are bigger), sweet potato fries, and 2 beers a piece and the total was less than $45. I saw complaints about the shrimp being overcooked, but ours was done perfectly.\n\n4. They have a full bar.\n\n\nCons for Hot N Juicy:\n\n1. Their parking lot is tiny...fits maybe 20 cars. We had to park in the lot across the side street and walk over.\n\n2. Restaurant is a lot smaller than BC. If you go on a super busy night, it might take you a bit longer to get seated. That's the main reason that we went tonight instead of on a Saturday.\n\n3. You walk out of there smelling like crap. But...you would at BC too. So I guess that's not much of a con.\n\nIn terms of the food...the level was about the same, although I will say this (and I hope it makes sense): while H&J was a little bit spicier, BC had more flavor to it. My friend and I both liked the sweet potato fries here better than at BC. The size of the sausage (har, har, har) was bigger at H&J. Beer prices were the same, which is a huge plus. You really can't beat $3 for a Corona. Both places have TVs, which at the time were playing the Lakers game.\n\nIf I was in town again, I would probably end up going back. It's no BC, but it fills the void.\n\nI'd give it 3 3/4 stars, but I round up because I'm nice."

I might take tourists here for something unique, or I may come back if I crave this specific flavor, but otherwise I don't see myself coming here \"just because.\"\n\nI would totally pay more money for gloves that were appropriately sized.

I have never been to a restaurant with this concept, but I thought it was great. The table ordered a little bit of everything; crawfish, shrimp, & crab. Everything was delicious but the king crab legs are fantastic. We were talking about the food for days after.\n\nThe wait staff were friendly and able to handle a rowdy bunch of guys. You may want to arrive by cab because I don't think there is much in the way of parking. To help offset the wait time check out Crown & Anchor bar across the street."

Yet, I'm sitting here tonight to complain about their horrible customer service. \n\nWhen I came here, my name was written down and I was told that it would be half an hour wait. Even after the half an hour mark, I insisted to my BF that sometimes servers are wrong on their wait time. I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The server started to seat people based on the amount of people in the party rather than giving priority to who came first. You might ask how the heck I would know this, and the answer to this question is that a party of 6 who very obviously put their name down after mine were seated first. \n\nOnce we were seated, 57 minutes later, we waited another 15 for a server to even ask us what we would like. \n\nDear Hot N Juicy executives, \n\nWe all get busy. I get that. But some employees of yours need to be disciplined on the meaning of customer service. I might have not brought a large party, but that doesn't mean I didn't bring a big appetite. \n\nI hope the next time I come in, this indecency will not be an issue."

Hot N Juicy has definitely satisfied my craving for the crawfish/shrimp in a bag that I am so used to getting in my family's home state of Louisiana. Upon entering the restaurant we were received a warm welcome and sat down very quickly. The two flat screen plasmas across the way had ESPN news and the Dodger game on so I was very happy about that!! Our server guided us the the small menu and gave us a flavor profile of each seasoning that they had for their seafood fare. My friend and I had 2 lbs of crawfish and 2lbs of shrimp with a half order of sausage. When our order came to the table, we opened up our plastic bags with excitement!! At that moment both of us were placed in a euphoric state by the smell!! The Hot n Juicy special seasoning (spicy or extra spicy will make you want to slap somebody it is so good) is what I recommend for your seafood....a whole lot of spice and garlic which I love!! We put our bibs on and went to town!! The crawfish/shrimp/sausage were fresh, and the corn/potato was just as flavorful as the seafood. The service was great....we had someone at our table for what ever we needed at all times. I would give this place another half star for having Heineken Light available which I can't seem to find in many places except for my fridge!! A very enjoyable experience at the Hot N Juicy!! I will be back soon.........probably tomorrow!!"

What's the next step?? Of course I had to bring my hungry ass to check this place out myself :)\n\nWent along with my friends/RETURN customers yesterday (monday) haha and luckily there was no wait because apparently I've heard that they would have a 2 hr wait time...woah. Got seated to our table and I scanned the whole place out... it's actually nice inside. Not a fancy nice, but nice as in a chill laid back vibe. Being that it was my first time, I told the server what is \"normal\" for myself to \"CONSUME\" lol (food served in pounds). And she mentioned 1lb is normal for 1 person. She suggested the HOT N' JUICY SPECIAL, shrimp or crawfish. I picked shrimp. then there's a choice of how spicy you want it - Medium, Spicy, or Extra Spicy. Personally I love spicy food! I was thinking extra spicy! but then the server was saying that sometimes going extra spicy takes away the flavor of the food... and of course I didn't want THAT to happen haha. \n\nFood arrives! got the napkins in place, my cup of water, and the infamous crawfish bib on.....now my game face starts! lol. Overall, the shrimp was definitely JUICY being soaked in with all the spice n' garlic! Spice level was perfect for me, although I should of tried the extra spicy too see how dangerous they seem to sound. Always next time. \n\nBTW, I was not able to finish the lb. of shrimp I ordered since I had to peel the skin off one by one! I got full quicker because I ate slow!! FML! haha. This place is one spot you would want to come to if you need some livin la vida loca in your life!! haha"

Parking is still a bit tricky but definitely more space.  Crawfish are still a bugger to eat, it is fun sucking and slurping up the juice that marinades the crawfish.  Once you have accomplish all the sucking and slurping, you are rewarded with the tiniest meat but it is all so worth it!\n\nMy suggestion is go in a group so you are able to order in bulk and try everything! Ordering steps are pretty easy; it takes 3 steps to order you scrumptious crustacean.  Step one, order your seasoning, step 2, order the hotness of your seasoning and step three, order your crustacean!  Now it's not just a crawfish place, they offer lobster, crabs, shrimps and clams.  So don't get put off because of the crawfish, there's other crustacean for you to choose from. \n\nThe wait is still the same, first come first serve!  No reservation and be patient.  But the wait is so worth it!\n\nP.S. Be prepare to get a little dirty, so don't wear your church whites or \"date\" clothes; come prepare to get stained a bit! ;)"

It was more than enough for the two of us.  The mild sauce had a big kick to it so if you're not the spicy fan, I don't even recommend the mild!  The sausage was really good as it had a snap to it and the corn was infused with a buttery version of the Hot n Juicy sauce.

Next time, I might just devein all my shrimp after peeling it.  Something else that bothers me about the shrimp is that the flavor is all encased on the outside. The actual shrimp has no flavor.

My lips were tingling with the medium and I love spicy food. We also got and order of the cajun fries and a side of rice. I put some of the sauce on the rice and that was super delicious!! \n\nOther reviews say how packed this place gets. Not the case on a thursday night. We were seated immediately, however there was a good sized line when we left. Service was great and the food was wonderful. Our next trip out we will definitely be stopping for a bite again."

The girls waiting on us were fun and helpful. Told us that the crawfish can come pretty spicy so order one down, so we got the mild (wimps we are).\n  We ordered beers and our crawfish were fun little buggers to eat, however it does come in a soupy bag, and the amount of garlic is nuts. My vampire husband got a little queasy, he doesn't handle garlic too well, next time he will try one of their other fun items. My breath was humming till the next morning, but I'm cool with that. I also got a cute tank top! If you come to Vegas often I would say you have to come here at least once."

Whatever seasoning I choose, I always ask them to not make it spicy; as mild as possible, yes I am a wuss.\n\nThough crawfish is in their name, go for the shrimp because that is the best bang for the buck.  There is more meat and you do not have to fight for the little meat that you get in the crawfish.  The cajun fries are tasty also.\n\nPros: great service, great food\n\nCons: small parking lot\n\nDefinitely a place to stop by while in Vegas.  It is not really too far off the strip."

Hot N Juicy is the rare exception to this rule.  Breaking into crawfish and sucking the juice from their heads is messier than one would expect.  \n\nI can vouch for the crawfish, crab legs and lobster.  I'm also a huge fan of the Hot N Juicy Special seasoning.  I have kind of a \"When in Rome\" approach to food ... if something is a specialty or a namesake, more often than not it's damn good.  When I lived in Vegas, I would frequent this place often and bring visitors from out of town here.  Never a dissatisfied experience or visitor.\n\nA few thing to keep in mind though ... expect to wear a bib and smell like Hot N Juicy for the rest of the day ... maybe into the next day.  This place is also crowded, expect to wait ... It's well worth the wait though.  Hot N Juicy is an experience, be ready to get your hands dirty."

A few tips:\n1- hot & juicy sauce is definitely spicy. Ordered mild and it's what most people would consider medium hot. \n\n2- crab legs were delicious in the lemon pepper sauce. Not the best bang for your buck because of the shell weight. That said, most gratifying in terms of how much meat comes out of each leg. Worth a try for sure!\n\n3- rolls. This was a last minute addition and one I'd highly suggest. Order some rolls (they came out nice and warm) to dip in the sauce- perfect way to round out the meal\n\n4- gloves. They don't offer them unless you ask and its worth it. They have thin plastic disposable gloves which come in VERY handy especially with all the spicy sauces you're dipping into.\n\nThis place is worth going to again and again. Came in on a weekday around 8PM and the wait was approximately 20 minutes. Moved along quickly and most definitely worth the wait!"

We were greeted right away and were taken to our seats. We were thankful as other reviews indicated that it could get busy. Keep in mind there are two locations in Chinatown Vegas.\n\nThe menu was easy to follow. We ordered a pound of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, sausage, and corn on the cob in Cajun style. It was scrumptious. The shrimp and crawfish weren't over cooked. It was seasoned well, flavoring was good, and it wasn't too spicy for my palate. It was rich and buttery goodness. Let the corn soak up all the sauce and then suck the juice and bite into it. Heavenly. You could even order a side of rice. \n\nOur waitress was attentive and she refilled our drinks regularly.

Alexis was inattentive, she barely checked in with our table our drinks were empty and our food took forever to come out. The table of four was seated after us and served before us, even the party of eight was seated after us and served before us. Half of our party of four received their food while we continued to wait for ours we order shrimp and snow crab. Once they were finished with there food we recieved our 10 mins later snow crab then the shrimp five minutes later(we didn't get gloves, and the other table next to us asked for leg crackers for is). When we inquired about our food she explained that everything comes out when ready. I understand that but wouldn't it make more sense to make orders together so that they can all be served at the same time! What's the point of going to eat out if you have to watch the other person eat while you wait? Alexis should've explained this. Melody  (wears a sunflower pendent) took over while Alexis was on lunch and was extremely nice and accommodating. Maybe more servers need to be on staff so the severs aren't overwhelmed and can provide excellent service. There are other restaurants in town comparable to this one, you should make sure you stick out more than the rest."

Great seasoning, good quality seafood, fair market prices. Since it's so popular, there is usually a wait at the door- we waited about 30 min. The wait staff is helpful & informative, but it's hard to hear due to the noise level in there- the music is great, tho a little loud. The food arrives in good time, but the staff was a little slow in keeping up with the drinks considering how spicy it is ;) \nOne thing to beware of- the parking lot gets crowded & often people park on Frontier street- when I returned to my car, the window was smashed :( So, park in that neighborhood at your own risk!"

I live in Henderson and do not go across town to often to eat. It is a simple family owned place that we need more of in this town. The food is simple to order its all by the pound. We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp (Our favorite), 2 pounds of crawfish (very good) both were mild with the hot and juicy special sauce. They tasted great but if you want more of the Louisiana taste get the 2ND sauce I think it is called Juicy Cajun. We also tried the fried soft shell crab with fries (oh so good), Oysters on the half shell(fresh and good size, from the gulf not salty but I think its because of the season), potato's, corn, and sausage (potato's and corn are a must have, the sausage was ok) and last we got the etouffee (this was ok my wife really liked it I thought it had to many bell peppers but thats just me). There is more on the menu but all I could try this visit. I will return for sure the food is really that good. I put $$$ for the price because I ordered more than we needed but you will spend 25 to 35 per person easy.Please visit this restaurant they are doing so much perfect. The service was very friendly. Thank you to everyone for your reviews. It was the reason I had to try it.\n\nWent back for some live blue crab and everything was as good as the 1st time. The blue crab is now my favorite. The bread rolls also are a must have to eat with the sauce. I know this place is different but if you love seafood please give it a try."

We went during the day for lunch so there wasn't really anyone there which was good bc the place gets packed for dinner. I'm from the bay so I'm not new to the crawfish scene. I've tried several crawfish places in the past but hot n juicy is by far the best. If you've ever been to a crawfish restaurant then you know it's all about the sauce they cook it in. The hot n juicy special is the bomb diggity. The perfect combo of herbs and spices. You also get to pick the level of spicyness that you want. I personally prefer the shrimp over the crawfish but thats just me. Peeling shrimp is less work and more meat so you do the math. I wish there was a hot n juicy in the bay. Maybe they will think about expanding soon. lol Be prepared to get your hands dirty but it is super worth it. You will not be disappointed!

I assume only in California and it's closest neighbor Vegas have places like this.\n\nI actually really like this place. The spices they use in their signature Hot-N-Juicy is off the hook, much better than Crawdaddy (in San Jose) and right up there if not better than Boiling Crab (in San Jose). We ordered the King Crab Legs in butter and garlic and Hot-N-Juicy in mild and medium as we were all wimps, Shrimp in Hot-N-Juicy in medium also, Cajun Fries, Sweet Potato Fries and Corn on the Cob and Potatoes! I love that they serve the corn on the cob and potato in the bag with the juices, the other places mentioned above don't and they don't have potatoes either. They also have blue crab here which the ones in San Jose don't have. Can't wait to go here again!\n\nThe service wasn't the best, they forgot the fries and I had to keep asking for water. But all in all this is a good off the strip joint for those staying in town for the weekend. Get there early because I hear there is usually a wait, sounds like all the other places too!"

Let's go.\n\nTouched down in Vegas at 5pm, checked into the hotel, and took a cab off the Strip to Hot and Juicy Crawfish.  It was a Monday night, and yet, the wait time for a table was 45 minutes!  Wow, really??  I was irritated, but at the same time, I was excited.  This must be really good if all these locals are lined up here waiting for crawfish!\n\nAfter pacing back and forth and continually asking the waiters if our table was ready for about 45 minutes, we finally got seated.  Our table was buzzing with anticipation.  I ordered two pounds of the Garlic Butter ($10.99/ per lb.).  They have a lot of other seafood as well, but I came here for the crawfish!   And it was DELICIOUS!  They weren't as big as I've had them, but they were cooked perfectly and the seasoning was amazing.  \n\nAfter we finished eating, I was a bit startled when I got the bill.  $10.99 per pound of crawfish??  Supermarkets in Dallas sell crawfish for less than $2 a pound!  I guess you have to factor in the cost of shipping fresh crawfish from Louisiana all the way to Las Vegas, Nevada - which apparently they do EVERY day.  \n\nIs this the best crawfish I've ever had?  I'd say it's on par with the Boiling Crab, which is my favorite crawfish place in Dallas.  And it's only $4.99 a pound there!   However, if you're in Vegas, there's not a whole lot of alternatives.  If you love fresh crawfish, this is the place to go. \n\nPros: fresh crawfish, garlic butter seasoning is delicious\n\nCons: $10.99 a pound!  Always busy, expect a long wait time"

It reminded me of alot of the crawfish places in Houston - plastic table covering and a roll of paper towels included.  They were on point with the seasoning and the 'heat' of the food.  Bae ordered Fried Shrimp basket, with an order of catfish...cornmeal batter.  not thick, not dry; I had an order of Crab legs (Lemon butter/Hot) , and a order of shrimp (H&J mix/Hot). and an order of corn fritters.  The food is brought to you in bags....sold by the pound.  Everything was super good...I really liked the lil corn balls....They were just as described to me - fried cream corn...which was AWESOME SAUCE!!!.  They made me happy inside...they gave me life.  All of the seafood was seasoned to the core.  The only thing I didn't like was that the shrimp were still completely whole....head, eyes, poop-shoot, antennas, legs.... everything - so that was kinda icky....  I don't like having to clean my food before I eat it...I want it to go straight from the plate/bag to my mouth....but, I was a big girl and ripped those heads right on off. I had to request a bucket tho...apparently those do not come automatically to the table....I just can't have those black lil beatty eyes staring back at me while I consume their bodies...Food makes me emotional...but I refuse to feel guilt from a shrimp, damnit!!!!!   The shrimp shells kinda stuck to the meat, so it was hard to get off, and the meat was kinda chewy on a few....but overall - everything was GREAT and Tasty!!  Altho I felt like I was in a strip club, or Raisins on South Park, with the waitress calling everybody - \"Sweetie\" - The service was wonderful.  She was really nice, and efficient.  The drinking water was kinda gross, so I drank my tasty iced tea!  The bathroom was clean, and I liked that they give you numerous pairs of plastic gloves and the bib at the table...Seafood juices will be flyin'!!!! ...And, no one wants to leave out smelling like a yeast infection......\n\nThis was a dining success....I definitely hope to return on my next visit to LV!  I want to try the corn, potatoes, and sausage!\n\nWe ubered there -  but if you have a car....BEWARE - their parking lot is EXTREMELY small and very hard to get in and out of if there is any type of crowd."

Crawfish meat is quite tiny once you peel the gigantic shell. If you buy 2lbs of crawfish, you automatically get a free corn and potato. Awesome!!! Get the hot n juicy special seasonsing which is basically a combination of all the other seasonings. I'm usually content with mild and medium spicyness level but my mother in law  get extra extra spicy and lemme tell ya... that kills you. \n\nIf you're lucky, you can catch them when they have etouffee (kind of like gumbo). Delish! Has pieces of crawfish, red bell pepper, celery.. etc. The flavor tastes similar to the hot n juicy special but I'm not sure. \n\nSurprisingly, they have one of the bessstttt chicken wings anywhere.

Dipping it in the lime w/salt, pepper and chili powder helped a little but the flavoring was still a bit lacking.\n\nAll in all, it was an okay meal.  Would I come back?

Well, needless to say, I;ve returned time & time again. EVERYTHING on the menu is great. I love the no frills, what you see is what you get. Styrofoam cups, plastics table coverings & rolls of papers on the table. I don't think there is a plate to be found in the building.

I always seem to get there @ the perfect time.

Lots of garlic and spice goodness.  Great when they add a potato and corn into the bag so they too soak up the flavors.  A little messy, so you want to go with people you are comfortable with and takes time to eat your food, so don't go when you are in a rush!  Only thing that could see being an issue for some if you are weird like me, the shrimp are in their shell with the heads on, so you have to take the heads off and they are not deviened, so that could be a little gross to think about.  I ate a whole bag to myself and I didn't get sick, nothing to worry about.   Prices are by the pound, so it can add up!   \nQuite messy, so just be ready and use all the paper towels they give you.

The medium spiciness has some kick to it.  They have actually five levels of spiciness which is ridiculous unless you're a hardcore fan of spicy food.

Took a trip to Vegas with a group of our friends and decided to have dinner with one of my friends friends who said we could try this place. \n\nWhen we got there it looked to be pretty busy with a fifteen to twenty minute wait which wasn't to bad. The host was pretty cool and talked to us for a bit while we waited for our table. We finally got seated and ordered right away. It pretty much took them 20 minutes or more for them to come out and let us know that our food was going to be coming out a little late due to the rush they had. 10-15 minutes after that was when our food came out. The sauce was good but a bit watery. The shrimp was perfect and not over cooked. The service was alright with the waiter coming to check on his here and there. As I was eating one of the remaining shrimp that was left in the bag I noticed a thick black hair on the head of the shrimp. Normally I would think it was just the whiskers or whatever you want to call it from the shrimp but NO it was straight up a pubic hair with the little white thing on bottom tip of it from wherever the hair was from. My friend decided to take the piece of shrimp with pube still on it up to the front and complain. The asshole Caucasian male waiter gave her attitude and claimed it wasn't hair and that it was one of the whiskers from the shrimp. He said that the hair wasn't purely black and that there was a redish color to it which was bull shit. So my friend came back to sit down with us and was irritated with the waiter for handling the situation the way he did. The host that was talking to us before we got seated walked by and we showed him the hair and even he himself knew it was a piece of hair. He joked around and said \"well thats obviously not my hair.\" and laughed because he had a buzzed head. He finally took care of the situation and took the order of shrimp off the bill for us and apologized. \n\nOverall... place is over priced compared to what the Cali prices are. The sauce is not too bad but not what I imagined it to be after all the hype. And lastly the service sucked balls but the only thing that made up for it was the host who was nice enough to help us out. Would I go back there ever again? Absolutely not!"

So I've been wanting to check out Hot N Juicy since I moved to Vegas, but I tend to think of it as a communal eating experience that requires at least a small group. I finally had my chance last weekend when my aunt and cousin came into town with their friends. \n\nFor 5 people (four women, one man) we ordered 3 lbs of crawfish, 4 lbs of shrimp, a dozen sausages, and one corn and potato for each person, all cooked in the Hot N Juicy house seasonings (as recommended by the waitress when we couldn't decide). The first time you go to a restaurant like this it is hard to know what spice level to choose. We had a mixed group so we played it safe by getting everything mild and asking for a medium sauce on the side. I can handle spicy pretty well, and I think the mild was perfect if you just want to enjoy the flavor of the food with a small amount of kick for the authentic Cajun taste. Granted, the shrimp hold the spice much better than the crawfish (since you get such a small amount of meat out of crawfish). I think that if I came here with just my husband, we'd probably opt for medium level spice since he puts hot sauce or salsa on everything!!\n\nKnow before you go: There are no plates. You are served all your food in plastic bags (to hold in the juices) right on your table which is covered with paper and supplied with plastic gloves and a roll of napkins. You are also given a bib to wear, and you'll need it!!! It is a messy and time consuming meal (for the infrequent crawfish eater) but once you get over getting \"down and dirty\" at dinner, it is well worth it!!"

Came here with my girlfriend to have a nice dinner and heh were totally off their game tonight. \n\nThey gave us a hard time about asking about our food that didn't come out. We ordered some potatoes and they totally forgot about it until the end. Then when I put in an order for clams in garlic butter medium they gave it to me in hot n juicy seasoning medium. I let them know and they told me that they looked very similar. I said I did have it before and the waiter even agreed it did look the same. They gave me a side of garlic butter after the meal was over. They let me know they look very similar and that I was wrong. I told our waiter and the waitress that I have had it before and it did not taste the same. The girl let me know that with different seafoods it tastes different........ I understand different seafood tastes differently that's why I ordered something different in a different sauce!!!! The sauce was definitely hot n juicy and I didn't like how they kept insisting that the sauce wasn't the same. \n\nAnyways. Food was okay. Service was awful. Thanks guys. \n\n*oir waitress name was Polina."

Alas the time had come and I dragged my friends to this place before our long drive back home to SoCal.  There are four different sauces you can choose from: Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, and Hot n Juicy Special. We got two pounds of shrimp, two pounds of crawfish and a pound of snow crab.  They were covered in Garlic Butter and the Hot n Juicy Special.  We also got cajun fries and sausage.  Everything was so full of flavor.  All the seafood came in plastic bags to seal in the steam and flavor.  The crawfish were a bit hard to eat, but it was still quite delicious.  However, the only bad thing is that you will not get the smell out of your fingers for a couple days..no matter how much you wash your hands...and use hand sanitizer, but that's the price you have to pay for some delicious cajun seafood. :) I would definitely go back during my next Vegas trip."

Sometimes the shrimp barely has the sauce and spice in it because it was not cooked in it long enough. The shrimp may not be plump anymore but mushy, mushy as in maybe not fresh but aging quite a bit? At any rate, I no longer crave their shrimps after coming here for years. May have to even eat the ones at Boiling Crab. It seems once they expanded to 3 locations they just started sucking. Service is still good but the shrimp is no longer special. Even the secret sauce is. It that great anymore. Where's that strong garlic taste from when you order garlic spice???"

A no-frill place outside & inside, plastic sheets on the table with a roll of paper towel. They serve mainly seafood (shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, fried fish, etc). Your seafood comes with your choice of seasoning, which also comes with your choice of spiciness levels. I picked the Hot & Juicy Special seasoning in mild, which it still had a bit of a bite to it, with a robust garlic flavor. I loved it.\n\nYour seafood is delivered to your table in a plastic bag, and if you order any potato or corn on the side, they come in the same bag too, along with the seafood & seasonings. My husband ordered the fried catfish basket and he said they were good. No utensils, just you, your plastic bibs and your hands. So it does get quite messy. I ordered  pound each of crawfish, shrimp & crab legs. Just get down to cracking with my food & a few bottles of beer made for a nice, relaxed lunch while on vacation. \n\nThe staff were nice & friendly. Since we were first-timers the girl who seated us explained the different seasonings & spice levels. She was very responsive, replenishing our drinks & clearing up items as we finish. \n\nNot cheap, but seafood usually isn't. I thought the market prices were fair. This will definitely become my Vegas spot to re-visit next time I come in town."

Ike's in SF was amazing. so of course I had to go try his places in vegas. \n\nI've only ever had fried crawfish before in tn, so this was my first live crawfish place. Everybody said the spiciness was spicy, and as a non spicy eater, I took the mild (a little bit spicy). However, it wasn't spicy to me at all. so i think everything is a lil overhyped. The crawfish was Good! It was dfeinitely an experience. they give you these cute little bibs to put on, and the crawfish come out in a plastic bag for each customer. You order by the lb, and 1 lb/per customer is definitely enough. On the other hand, the CORN is great!!! omg i love the corn that comes in with the bag. its really great. \n\nI only give it 4/5 stars bc the crawfish were good, but not AMAZING. I will have to say adam richman, this was a bit of a disappointment but I think I went in with super high expectations. (i also like everything fried, literally everything i eat i love it fried, so the fact that it wasn't fried i think deducted 0.5 stars)\n\nBut in the end, its a good place! i would definitely recommend. I've been to new orleans before and had authentic seafood there, and it had a very similar authentic taste.\n\n(Also surprised at the cheapness of the bill)"

We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish to share between my wife and I, which would have come to about $23 at current market price.  When the waiter dropped off my bag it seemed unusually beefy, and when he returned with the wife's shrimp, it too seemed large.  I asked him if these were one pound bags and he replied, \"No, two pounds each.\".  I told him we didn't order 2 pounds of each, just one, and he basically just shrugged his shoulders at us as if to say, \"Oh well, you've got em now.\" and walked away.\n\nI had to get up and go track him down to explain to him that I did not want that much food and did not want to spend $50 on lunch and that he needed to figure out another option.  He came back to our table and picked up our food, then returned with the proper amounts.\n\nThe food itself was OK, not great as other reviews state.  Crawfish seemed on the tiny side, and many of the shrimp were a bit overcooked and mushy.  Flavor was tasty though, we had the mild Hot N Juicy seasoning.\n\nThis place wasn't worth the drive from the hotel for us, but maybe we just caught them on a bad day.\n\nI would say this place is worth a shot, but I really can't recommend it based on my one and only visit."

But my wife and I had to give Hot and Juicy Crawfish a try after seeing it on one of our favorite shows, Man vs Food.\n\nThe food looked absolutely delicious on the show, everything that my wife and I come to expect from this type of restaurant.  We had a basketball tournament in Vegas this past weekend and made sure we made time to head over to Hot and Juicy.\n\nMade it there on Friday afternoon around 1:30pm. I was happy to see that it wasn't so busy and were able to get seated right away. At Boiling Crab, the average wait time is an hour.\n\nWe ordered the following: one pound of crawfish, two pounds of shrimp and five corns all in the special Hot and Juicy sauce medium spicy.\n\nThe sauce itself was not bad. It's doable but it does not compare to Boiling Crab's shabang sauce.  The shabang sauce is love at first bite. \n\nThe crawfish was not bad but the shrimp and corn were not very good. The body of the shrimp was fine but the shrimp heads was dry. No juice/brains to enjoy sucking on and the corn was very rubbery, sort of like eating candy corn.  My wife and I shared one corn and left 4 uneaten. Normally, we could eat three each.\n\nFor those who have not tried Boiling Crab, you might find Hot and Juicy Crawfish a good place to eat.  But for those who have dined at Boiling Crab, you will be disappointed.  \n\nI will be sending Adam Richman (host of Man vs Food) an email of my review and a recommendation that if he is ever in Orange County California, to stop by Boiling Crab and see what he thinks."

Tables were simple and covered with wax paper, which is expected since eating crawfish tends to get messy (they do give you bibs, but you shouldn't go in wearing your best and most expensive clothes).\n\nWe ordered two pounds of crawfish and an order of fried catfish.  Prices of the shellfish are market value, so you have to ask the wait staff (when we went, the price of crawfish was approximately $10 per pound.)  You then choose the type of seasoning you want for your crawfish and how spicy you want it.  We went with the Hot N Juicy special seasoning and Hot heat level, which was very delicious.  The Catfish was decent, but nothing special.  When you come here, stick with the shellfish.  \n\nI recommend this place.

Most crawfish joints do kind of the same thing but the variations in the sauces make them different.  What sets this place apart is they use the sichuan pepper (i think) which leaves your mouth a little numb but taste great and creates a unique spiciness.  As far as the items to order Ive had most of the menu but here are my suggestions.\n\nKing Crab Legs  - Hands down the item to get.  Huge chunks of crab with little effort.  You just have to know how to use the little plastic claw tool.  Use one side to make a crack then the other to slice through like scissors through paper.  Ask your server if you need help.  Don't be afraid of the price these are well worth it, trust me you wont be sorry.  \n\nShrimp - If your not going big with the crab legs then these are the best bang for your buck.  Best meat to price ratio and easy to eat.\n\nCorn - Soaks up the sauce like a sponge.  Make room in your gut for this.  Don't Sleep! \n\nFries - Regular or Sweet Potato are both tasty and good sharing choices to break up all the buttery spice from the seafood.\n\nSauce - I prefer the everything mix or whatever they call it here.  I also prefer extra spicy which I wouldn't suggest for most people.  Even spicy has a kick to it.\n\nThey can handle large groups and there is a second one down the street if this one is full."

Fresh crawfish flown in every day...shrimp and crab legs that are to die for, tender clams and the Hot N Juicy sauce (I prefer this sauce in hot but you get a choice of sauces & heat level) just covers everything with love! \n\nAll the seafood is served in bags so it keeps absorbing the flavor of the sauce. The crawfish comes with a potato and corn in the bag, but you can get it added to everything else. I recommend adding these as the corn gets the flavor of the sauce and the potato absorbs the sauce. I also like getting a bowl of rice as well and you can pour the sauce on it! \n\nYes, you are peeling and ripping your food apart with your bare hands, so ladies, if you do not want to mess up your manicure, they do provide gloves. I went brazenly bare last time though and it was a lot easier to eat and when I was done all the sauce washed off easily.\n\nThey now have 2 locations... I prefer the one that is furthest from the strip. The one closer is very, very loud because of the building. It's like being in a tin can, so take the extra 5 minutes and head a little further up Spring Mountain.\n\nI cannot wait for my next Hot N Juicy fix!"

I must say I was far from disappointed.  The service was great and they were on top of things.  I tend to consume a lot of liquids when i eat so it's nice to have prompt service and refills without having to ask.  Our waitress was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu and its options.  I love the variety of food and flavors.  We had the crawfish (hot n juicy style) and clams (garlic butter).  The flavors were amazing! But do be aware I was burping and tasting garlic for several hours later.  My only negative comment on the place would be their heat scale.  I got the clams less than mild and they were more like hot.  They did inform us that the heat scale was hotter than average and at times I do love something scorching.  But this time I was looking more for abundance of flavor instead of just hot.  Made it more difficult to discern flavors.  other than that we had a great experience and will come back again."

Service was great from the start, but this place was a bit of a letdown for me. The food just didn't live up to the prices. Regardless, we had a feast! Make the best out of the situation, right? (Ok, ok, we're just gluttons!)\n\nDisappointed in the beers they had available and had to drink Blue Moon's at $4 a bottle :( Anyways, onto the food. We ended up getting snow crab legs, clams, crawfish, oysters on the half shell, and a 1.7lb Dungeness Crab that ended up costing nearly $30, but was one of the worst crabs we've had! My friend complained to another waitress there and she ended up getting us a free lb of shrimp for free :) The waiter suggested we get everything in the hot & juicy sauce, so we did. I found it to be too salty and one dimensional for my liking.\n\nThe snow crab legs were excellent! Probably my favorite, so sweet and tons of meat unlike the Dungeness, which almost felt like they cooked a dead crab up for us. No joke. Second favorite of the night had to be the shrimp! They were plump, juicy, and way too easy to gobble up. The clams came out and seemed much spicier than the other bags. They were a little sandy and probably not in the water long enough :( \n\nThe oysters were also a major disappointment. Got a dozen Blue Point and some weren't ice cold and completely bland and flavorless. Only a few dollars cheaper than a dozen BP's from Swan's and it's not even close.  \n\nFood + Drinks ended up costing around $40/pp. Not worth returning to, but the service was fantastic!"

It was almost like he was fed up in being there and just didn't give a fck. Once we sat down, he came and yes... threw out menus in our face, threw sugar bags down on the table, and asked us you guys want anything to drink?! Daaaamn serious?!?!! Why Boo??!! WHY??! Wow okay... . Came back with our teas and took our orders.. that's the last time we saw his face. \n\nIt took numerous attempts to get a runner, server, whoever worked there to ask for refills, which finally was able to be refilled, but with regular tea when I had Raspberry. Nasty... The whole time we were there... our throats were like a desert and our drinks were empty.. so damn empty,  the melted ice made a few gulps of replenishment to get us through our meals. We had to ask for gloves, we had to ask again for our pepper and  limes on the side, which our server never brought, and we even had to ask the next table to please get their server's attention for us after she was done giving them their food orders, just so we could... Ask. Even our tools to crack open our crabs were not the right tools, but after trying to get a server's attention. It was more tiring to wave down a server than tear apart our meals. From the frustration on the service here, I tore the crab legs with my own bare hands and ate like an animal. Tearing it with my own straight teeth!!! Grrr!!! I ended up doing the.. break the shell with my fingers and gently wiggle wiggle the meat out. Several times I showed my great company that I conquered a looooong piece of crab meat Ha haaaa! But then she shows off her piece, which was thicker and longer than mine!!! Oh yeah?!??!!!! I had that Ooo impressed face and nodded my head. We entertained each other... But never once were we checked back upon to see how we were doing or we needed anything. It was literally the worst service for a fun-filled environment. \n\nI heard their other new location has better service, but this experience makes me think twice to even want to give them my business.\n\nThe food was the only thing that made me want to give Any stars to this establishment. The sweet potato fries was excellent in texture and taste. The shrimp, crab, and side of sausage we ordered were full of spice and with the combination of asking limes on the side to make your own sauce.. it tasted refreshing, sweet, spicy, peppery, bitter, and ended with a great bite from the acidity of the limes. Don't forget to ask for those pepper and limes on the side.. makes a great impact with the flavors of the spices that were cooked in with the crab and shrimp. Even if you have to hunt someone down that worked there to get it! I will note that the food deserves high remarks. However, due to the lack of service we received here, it's unfortunate to give it such a low rating. But I must speak the truth and the service here was... non-existence. Damn, DAMN shame if you ask me. It ruined a good meal experience and for us to constantly try to get a server's attention is just bad news. We couldn't enjoy our food and it shouldn't be that way.\n\nAnd for that reason alone... first and last time dining here. Wasn't so \"hot\" after all and that's the juicy part."

Cutting a piece of meat with a knife and/or fork/spoon (when I'm even lazier) is probably the most strenuous work I'll tolerate. Using my fork or spoon is enough, isn't it?\n\nThe ONLY, I repeat ONLY, food I'll take time to carefully work at and eat is shellfish...specifically crab, lobster and crawfish. Unfortunately, being located in the Tri State area, there is a lack of crawfish which saddens me. Since I was in town for work I jumped at the opportunity to eat one of my favorite shellfish friends...crawfish!\n\nAfter leaving the CES convention center, my colleagues and I hailed a taxi* and requested to go to Hot N Juicy located in Chinatown. A split second later, we realized Hot N Juicy sounded like a strip club so we joked around with the taxi driver and insisted it wasn't a peep show. We were going to that AFTER we ate.\n\nMy colleagues didn't know it but I was giggling like a little school girl when we arrived. Unfortunately for them, they aren't as adventurous when it comes to food so they ordered calamari, chicken wings and fries which they enjoyed.\n\nOur waiter was extremely informative, briefly describing to us (mostly me) how to order the seafood (per pound), by seasoning and spiciness. Since I've been to Boiling Crab I already knew what I wanted...2 lbs of garlic butter crawfish with medium heat. The garlic butter seasoning is SO mouth wateringly good that I could drink it as a side (not recommended though). They serve the seafood in plastic bags with bibs and paper towels. This is the messiest meal you will ever eat but so worth it. I was in business attire but was able to leave without any stains!\n\nAs I twisted and separated the head and tail, sucked the head and pushed out the meat from the tail...my colleagues looked at me in complete disgust like I was a monster. Did I feel bad? Not at all. I easily finished the 2 lbs of crawfish like a true fatty. I ordered medium heat but my mouth was on fire pretty much the entire time I was eating so to counteract the heat, I took big swigs of beer which helped. \n\nThe seafood pricing on the menu says market price so be sure to ask the waiter beforehand. The crawfish was about $10 per pound. Currently, they're having a BOGO shrimp special because they opened up another Hot N Juicy location in Washington, DC. Do I hear a road trip?\n\nMy next visit will showcase their blue crab legs. If you're ever in Vegas or DC, I would highly recommend coming here if you're a seafood lover and don't mind getting messy. It's a freakin' dream.\n\nA fun tip, Hot N Juicy was on Man vs. Food.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n*In Las Vegas, taxis aren't allowed to pick up passengers on streets like NYC.

My lips tingled for an hour after I was done eating.  Sweet potato fries were good too.  Their crawfish were humungous when I was there.  About 3 inches in length, compared to the 1.5 inch ones I get at the Boiling Crab in So Cal.  The only thing I wish is that the sauce had chunks of garlic in it.  That's what I love.  On a bad note, my husband said their wings totally sucked.  I didn't try them but they did look really small.  HNJ is a couple bucks more expensive than Boiling Crab in Ca.  Parking sucks.

The one thing I love about this place is that their crawfish are always huge! I've come here a couple times already and every time I come (around lunch time), there is no wait, which is a plus. Definitely recommend this place if you're craving some tasty, flavorful crawfish :)"

We've waited 40 mins....\nI was very disappointed. My family was disappointed. I expected more. I've been to The Boiling Crab, and this place doesn't come close. Being charged $9.99/lb for the crawfish, they were disappointedly small. I thought the crawfish were brought in from Louisiana.  The sauce had great taste went really well with white rice. Presentation of the product was not what I expected.... The servers were in very casually clothing but the decor didn't go with the atmosphere. The atmosphere has a sports bar feel but the decor was a lil too formal for me.\nMy husband was disappointed. After we left this place we were still hungry. Disappointingly hungry. Should of had Chinese food instead.\nThis place is over rated."

I'm sure there was more food, but I can't recall some of them. \n\nEverything we had was delicious. They aren't lying about their spicy level! Even the medium spicy was very spicy.

They do not have much on the menu, but what they do they do very well.  Border line 5 review.  I think the only thing holding it back from a 5 is the nature of crawfish itself.  I don't mind getting messy but it is a lot of work for not a whole lot of sustenance from each crustacean.  If I were to go there again, I would probably get the shrimp.  Less work, more reward.  The food comes out in boiled bags which you rip open.  Good idea to use the bib which is provided.  I went for one less than the spiciest sauce, and they were much spicier than used to when ordering at that level."

You order your seafood of choice by the pound and can find the daily market prices on a board by the kitchen. You choose your choice of seasoning and heat level. I went with the Hot N Juicy special and \"less than mild.\" Even at less than mild, the spice level was making my nose run a little bit (I'll admit, I'm a wimp). Service was okay. We had to ask the waitress for a refill after she passed our empty cups several times. I promise, I'm not a snob, but as a waiter myself, if a customer has to remind me for a refill, I'm not exactly doing my job. Anyways, on to the food:\n\nSnow crab w/ lemon pepper: Absolutely amazing. I don't know how, but their crab was some of the most moist I've had. Huge chunks were easy to pull out since the meat hadn't dried out. Don't forget to dip your crab meat in whatever seasoning you have. It takes it to the next level.\n\nCrawfish w/ Hot N Juicy: Great, but very small. The little bits of meat that you get from each crawfish wasn't very much. As a crawfish newbie, I was surprised, but now I know what I'm in for. If you're here for just crawfish, I'd get at least 2 pounds.\n\nMussels: WOW. Some of the best I've had. I never knew mussels could be so tender! I'm so used to having them dried out/rubbery as they're generally - and unfortunately - cooked.\n\nSides: CORN! Get lots of corn with your seafood of choice. Shake it in the bag, so it gets coated with the seasoning and save it for whenever you're done with your seafood. It will be all sorts of juicy goodness. My only regret: not getting more. The fries and sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked, but beyond that, weren't anything special. Especially if you're trying to eat on a budget, I'd load up on some sides with your seafood, otherwise you'll easily be spending $25+ per person to fill up.\n\nChicken nuggets: As we had a non seafood eater, he got some chicken nuggets which were pretty bad. They looked and tasted like they came from some Foster Farms frozen bag. However, since this place is meant for seafood, I don't hold it against the restaurant."

My mouth was on fire by the time I was through...the cajun fries were probably not the best idea with all of this hotness going on, but I guess that's why they call it HOT and juicy.

Couldn't wait to go, and it was dee-licious!  \n\nI had a pound of snow crab legs in their hot and juicy sauce.  Normally I would get the crawfish, but they are out of season right now, so they just had frozen available.  Thankfully our server had given us a heads up that their spicy was a notch or two above most other places; I had \"mild\" and my lips were burning with the first bite.  Not that I let a little thing like that slow me down.  You have to order corn and red bliss potatoes by the piece, so I had one of each, and they had also absorbed the awesome hot spicy flavor from the sauce.\n\nThe weak link in this restaurant are the servers.  Supposedly every server is yours, not just one.  But we found that meant asking several people for the same item before we actually got it.  Happened twice to us with requests for more ketchup and more water, and we heard the table next to us say the same thing.  Also, our original server placed our order incorrectly (which she acknowledged immediately) so then one member of our party had to wait 10+ minutes for her food to come out while the rest of us were eating.  And since we didn't have our \"own\" waitress, nobody gave us updates, nobody let a manager know, and we kept having to flag servers down to find out what was happening.  It definitely turned a five star rating into a four star rating."

I LOVE boiling crab!  The only thing stopping me from eating it so often is the wait, and the calories!\n\nWhen i went on a tuesday night it was relatively empty.  The place looks like a boiling crab and the concept is pretty much the same.   Menu is about the same too.  They have fresh oysters, the seafood boils, corn, potato, fried catfish, gumbo, fried shrimp etc.  For the four of us, we ordered 5 pounds of food.  4 pounds of shrimp in every flavor except lemon pepper, 4 corns, and 1 pound of clams in the hot and juicy sauce. \n\nThe food came quickly...and we were ready.  This place offers gloves but I say ditch it.  They are big and bulky and get in the way and in the end, your hands get soaked in the garlicky buttery oil anyways.  The hot and juicy flavor is by far my favorite.  We went with medium and there is a spicy kick to it.  Not too bad because i'm not one who can handle a whole lot of spice.  Some of the shrimp were overcooked so it was crumbling when i peeled it (minus one star).  I forgot what the other flavors were but i remember peeling the shrimp in the other bags and dipping it in the hot and juicy sauce.  Corn was really good too!  Corn is always my favorite thing to eat at places like this so I'm glad it was sweet and juicy.\n\nThe clams were very flavorful.  They soak in the sauce way better than shrimp.  You just get less food for the money though.\n\nAll in all i really like this place and will definitely come back.  I do think that they don't fully give you one pound of food.  I mean we each ate 1.25 pounds of food.  We killed everything!  And at boiling crab I usually only order 1/2 pound of shrimp with 2 corns and am STUFFED.\n\nThe sauce here is also a lot thinner.  Boiling crab is thick with tons of garlic bits but this was more watery.  I personally like a thicker sauce so its easier to grab with my shrimp.  Room for improvement but I would come here any day over the hour wait."

Being a newbie I would say my first time was memorable =)\n\nCONS: Service was a bit whack at first but nothing major to bring the place down. I had to keep asking for water and my cousin had to re-order her shrimp because they didn't ask her what kind of sauce she wanted. Luckily, the rest of us were hungry and ate her order, and she re-ordered... so, it worked out!\n\nBeware! I was hurting after this... good lawd! If you plan on going to a club that night... make sure you go HOURS and HOURS before or else you're gonna have to go when you have to go. LOL.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: Go because it will suffice your craving!"

I don't have to worry about using the right fork with the right dish.  Actually, I don't even need utensils.  Awesome!  This is precisely the reason I went here on a (hot)  Sunday afternoon with the boyfriend, hoping it would be a nice afternoon date spot.  I was right.  The place wasn't too packed, or noisy, and surprisingly, we were seated immediately.  \n\nIn terms of the food, as many of the California kids on here had mentioned, the menu is a lot like Boiling Crab.  In lieu of the Whole Shabang, you can get the Hot n' Juicy special, which is a combination of different spices.  We got that Hot n' Juicy special seasoning with 2 lbs of crawfish, boiled shrimp, a basket of fried shrimp and fries, and an order of oysters.   If you order  a 2 lb bag, they throw in a whole potato and cob of corn, both of which taste delicious after having been marinating in that cajun seasoning.  We ordered everything as Medium spicy, which the waitress had warned us as being very hot for most people.  I didn't think it was unbearably spicy.  It was just right!  However, If you're sensitive to spicy foods, you might want to go down a notch.\n\nNot to mention,  they also have a good selection of cheap beers to go with that Hot n' Juicy special.  Great local spot away from the craziness of the Las Vegas strip.  I'll be coming back!"

I visited Vegas with my girlfriends one weekend and was adamant about coming to this restaurant. We started our lunch off with a basket of garlic cajun fries to share. The fries tasted mediocre and I don't recall tasting any \"cajun\" flavoring. I also ordered a pound of garlic shrimp at mild with added corn and sausage. The bag came out piping hot when our server brought it out to us.  The sauce was mediocre; nothing spectacular that made me wanting to come back for more. My corn tasted 2 days old which of course I told our server! She was at least nice enough to remove it off our bill. :) \n\nAfter having such high expectations for this place, I realized this restaurant is totally overrated! I still prefer my Boiling Crab over this place any day!!"

It's a mix of all their seasonings (juicy cajun, lemon pepper and garlic butter) and its soooo yummy!! I am a wimp and cannot for the life of me take spicy, so the server suggested I try it without spice and yummm it was sooo good!!! My bf is the total opposite and loves spice, so when he got the hot n juicy crawfish at spicy, he said it wasn't spicy enough -.-;;;; he is a fatass and got 4lbs of crawfish and was totally enjoying every last bit of it. a little too excited....\nWe all shared a dozen oysters... mmmm it was a relief and cool break from the spiciness of the crawfishes for my  friends.\n\nMy friends got the crawfish too but in medium  hot n juicy. They are big boiling crab fans and said that there was a certain zing to their seasoning that BC doesn't but didn't want to love it more because of how far it is from us (we live in orange county). They also got the fried catfish basket. The catfish was breaded a little too much, and didn't taste as fresh as the rest of our meal. \n I got the soft shell crab basket on top of my shrimp and that was really good. The cajun fries that came with it weren't as impressive but were made better by the leftover Hot n Juicy sauce that I had. Hehehe\n\nAll in all, we had a good experience, our waitress was really cool (katherine, kaitlyn?? I don't remember....) pretty attentive, but we had to nudge her for water sometimes. \n\nWe'll probably be back, considering the long list of places we need to try in vegas in our short weekend stays."

My husband and I wanted to check this place out because we saw it on \"Man v Food.\"  Don't let the location fool you.  We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess, though the place was obviously really busy.  For five of us we ordered 4 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of king crab legs.  Looking back, we should have ordered more pounds of crab because 4 pounds of crawfish is an insane amount.  Both the crab and crawfish were so fresh and perfectly cooked.  They were brought out in plastic bags soaking in sauce, which I understood was to help the food really absorb the flavor.  We ordered it all with garlic butter flavor at the \"spicy\" level.  When they say spicy, they mean spicy.  We all have a high tolerance for spicy foods, and the restaurant's level of spicy maxed out our taste buds.  I recommend ordering rice or rolls to help tone down the spicy.  On a sidenote, don't wear anything that you'd mind getting dirty.  It is highly likely that you'll get crawfish juice on yourself or someone will get you from across the table.  Also, come mentally prepared to eat with your hands & no plates--it's part of the fun!  We also tried the seasoned fries, which were wonderfully prepared: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, perfect hot seasoning.  Halfway through our meal, the co-owner/wife of the chef came by our table to check on how we were doing.  She's kind and genuine--really wanting to know how our experience was so far.  Our waitress, Binh, was one of the most attentive servers I've ever met.  I cannot wait to go back!"

This place is located in a small strip mall like many others in the Asian part of town, keep driving past the Pho shops and the Chinese restaurants and you are here.\n\nThis is not your \"traditional\" crawfish, it keeps a lot of the traditional flavors but throws in some Southeast Asian flair.  I got the two pounder of crawfish, got couple of beers,  rolled up my sleeves literally but the bip and went to town on those bad boys.  I go the Hot and Spicy and it was the right about of heat in it for me, if you know what the jucieness from the head of the crawfish tastes like than you know what I am talking about, tons of shrimp like flavor juices with the spices, and since this reciepe has tons of butter it creates a layer that stays on the shell which ups the calories, cholesterol, and saturated fat but takes the flavor up too.  The corn was a bit overdone though, the potato was good but only two little pieces.  This gets me a bit because corn and potato are cheap but tasty bits and yet they skimp on it.\n\nEverything was good besides the corn and potato.  They should have a sign that tells you what the market price is before you order because $12.99/lb??"

I got the crawfish boil with the signature sauce.  The sauce can be ordered to whatever level of heat you desire.  I went for the extra spicy, which I will warn lives up to its name.  \n\nThere is a lot of flavor here, and the sides were no less disappointing.  From the sweet potato fries to the corn on the cob, everything was excellent.\n\nThis place is obsessed with quality through simplicity, and it's no surprise that the crawfish is shipped in fresh each morning.\n\nFinally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the prices.  Everything here is priced well below what I would consider reasonable for what is delivered, making this a huge value for the dollar.\n\nIf you're hankering for something more low key, more down home and (way) less glamourous than what's on offer on Las Vegas Boulevard, stop on in."

Coming from Hawaii, we don't get to visit as often as we would like, plus there are so many other eateries in LV that we like to try.  We last ate at this location maybe two years ago - they didn't have fresh dunganess crab or crawfish at that time, so we hadn't gone back since, but after trying the fare at other 'crab' restaurants and not being 'thrilled', we decided it was time to go back to HnJ (we've only been to this location on two previous visits and have never tried the other location down the road in central C-Town).\nI guess you can say that my wife and I are crab people - we love to eat good shellfish and don't mind getting 'up to our elbows' while digging-in, shelling, peeling and devouring good/fresh crab or lobster and now fresh crawfish.  We lucked out on this visit - they had fresh live dunganess crab and crawfish.  So in our excitement with this good news, we ordered one dunganess crab (approx. 1.5#); one pound of snow crab (legs cluster); one pound of crawfish; and one pound of clams - all this prepared in their own 'Hot n Juicy' sauce, medium hot.  Add to that two potatoes and two corn and one bowl of rice.  Talk about plenty of food for two people!?  Our server was Joie - all the servers carry some type of 'walkie-talkie' equipment and can call the kitchen to weigh the individual dunganess crab and let you know right there how heavy your crab is, because everything is sold by the pound.  Joie was super helpful; not only in answering our questions and taking our order, but throughout the entire meal - she would continuously come by our table to see how we were doing and if we needed any more drinks or whatever.\nWife ordered a coke and I ordered a beer - they were at our table in a jiff which was great since the outside temp was in the high nineties.  In good time, they brought each order out in double plastic bags - steaming and super hot.  This was my first experience at eating fresh crawfish and after this, I don't think that I can go back to any of that frozen stuff - totally different in texture and taste.  I would definitely order that again.  My wife kept on commenting how everything was so fresh, meaty and tasty, even the snow crab was solid and sweet.  As you probably have read in earlier reviews, there are no dishes or eating utensils, other than those plier-type crab-crackers and plastic shuckers.  Also, they provide plastic bibs and gloves, but if you don't like eating with your hands and getting crab juice on your arms and face, this may not be for you.  Definitely not a 'prom date' restaurant, but they provide plenty of paper towels and handi-wipes to address this messy, barbaric and fun experience. For us on this visit the food was definitely five stars.\nBut I must add, what made the experience here even more super was the positive atmosphere and overall vibe in this restaurant.  There was another female server and one male server - and I can't help but observe people when I'm out dining.  They both were like our server Joie - super polite (not condescending), always cheery, helping out each other and trying their best to make your HnJ meal a great experience - great food and great service.  We've been to too many restaurants where you have one and not the other; and for us on this day HnJ was tops."

We waited for about 35 minutes for our food which wasn't too bad since they had told us they were a bit behind but one of the people with us didn't get thier order and after asking twice where it was (& everyone just saying I'll check)...another 20 min went by and his food finally came but was wrong!

The server was apologetic but honestly she didn't even seem to know what was going on with our order. \n\nIt was a busy night so maybe that played a part, but overall the food is definitely worth coming back for!"

After reading some reviews about the place, I warned them all not to wear their fancy church clothes. And I'm glad I didn't let them because it is MESSY! \n\nThe food itself was ok. I read other reviews about too much salt, I have to disagree, not enough in my opinion. The food was a little bland and also kinda pricey for the amount of food you get. We were  all still hungry after almost spending over $200.\n\nAnother reason I knocked some stars off is because of the service. We didn't get just one waitress, we got 3 different ones. So we kept having to repeat ourselves. We clearly told them we were all gonna share everything, yet they forgot to bring everyone the utensils for the crab legs. Only half of us got them. There were 8 drinks, but we only got 6 straws, etc. it just wasn't good service. We still left a big tip because they did have to clean our mess afterwards."

First of all, I could smell the seafood when I opened my car door! It smelled so good! We walked in, and I noticed there was white plactic on all of the tables, and no silverware. My first thought was that this was going to be an interesting dinner.  \n\nWe were seated really quickly. We arrived around 9, and they close at 10, so the dinner rush had already come and gone. Our server was named King, and he was great. He explaned the menu, made some recommendations, and explained how to order. We decided on 2 sets of the meal that came with 1lb of shrimp, 1lb of crawfish, corn, potatoes, and sausage. One we chose the hot and spicy seasoning on baby spice, and the other was the garlic butter seasoning also on baby spice. Glad we picked baby spice on both, as even that had a little kick to it!\n\nThe server brought out the food, and it came out in plastic bags, and super super hot! We dug in! Being newbies to this place, we honestly had no idea what the shrimp came whole hahaha my son's girlfriend and I laughed and gave each other a look when we realized we were going to have to shell and pull the faces and legs off!\n\nThe food was awesome. The corn was the best corn I have ever had. The potatoes were kind of bland, but the fish was so good. I personally liked the hot and juicy flavored sausage the best, but the garlic butter corn and shrimp. \n\nI am totally going back for a date night with my husband. I would highly recommend! Oh, and they give you a bib, and offer gloves if needed :)"

I ordered one pound of shrimp with the hot N juice seasoning.  This is basically a combination of all of the four seasonings that are offered.  The hot N juicy seasoning has a very unique taste that I didn't particularly like.  I did however LOVE the fried shrimp.  The breading that was used was spicy cornmeal.  Man...they sure know how to cook those bad boys.  They were so good, I returned the next day for a second helping!  I will go back again, but try a different seasoning the next time.   And buy-the-way....I really wish they would remove the heads of shrimp before they serve them however."

First of all, I've been to the Spring Mountain locations before.  The food is the same, but the ambiance is totally different.  This Hot N Juicy is bigger, cleaner, and has enough TV screens to keep you occupied while you wait for your food.  If you felt cramped at the other locations, then give this H&N a shot. \n\nI dig this H&J and as for their food, it's messy good.  Present during our dinner was Teri W, Terri R, Tracy P & Hubby, Khatherine & Boypren, Michael K, and Norm K.  We had a great time during dinner and our waitresses were efficient with handling such a big group.  Like I stated before, the food is messy good.  You can't eat here without getting food all over the place. Terri and I shared the 2 lbs of their Garlic Butter Shrimp and White Rice.  My strategy was to peel the shrimp, mix it with my white rice, and try to stay clean.  Peeling the shrimp was a slippery mess and it's a good thing I had gloves.  As for trying to be proper and eating with a fork, that didn't happen.  The garlic butter shrimp with rice was so good that I ate it Pinoy style (with my hands).  The shrimp was seasoned just right and I can't wait to give them a shot again.  \n\nTIP:  Don't wear white and use their bib.  \n\nPS:   The spice levels can be high by choice.  Ask Michael K.  He went for their hottest flavor.  I can't even imagine peeling that shrimp with no gloves and a paper cut.  Hah!"

Not much in terms of decor.\n\nOn football game days, it's BOGO beer on all beers, which is pretty awesome. Be sure to ask for the full beer list as they don't automatically bring you that menu.\n\nUnfortunately, when we went, they were out of blue crab. So we went for the Alaskan king crab and shrimp. The shrimp you can order by the 1/2 lb, which is nice. (Everything is minimum 1 lb.)\n\nWe went with the garlic butter seasoning with medium spice for the king crab and the hot 'n' juicy seasoning with spicy spice for the shrimp. It is definitely spicy! (And I say that as someone who loves spicy things.) We also ordered the cajun fries (which were loaded with seasoning). (Tip: Ask for a side of ranch for the fries.) The Alaskan king crab legs were gigantic! Some of the biggest I've ever seen (including in Alaska).\n\nAll the food was yummy. I liked that they gave you gloves as well as bibs. This really helped IMHO as your hands didn't get covered in sauce and seasoning.\n\nWe were never offered another drink or if we wanted any other food. We had to ask for several tools. So like I said, not exactly good service. But the seasoning was on point and the seafood was fresh and yum. So I'd be willing to overlook the service issues and eat here again."

If I call in right before I leave my house, it's ready when I get there (15 min.). Smooth transaction. Never waited.\nI love spicy food and I'm not sensitive to any spicy food at all, so I ordered mine with \"Extra Spicy\" when I was there for the first time. I got major stomach ache 2 hours later. Be careful. If you are sensitive to spicy food, order \"Baby Spice\" not \"Mild\". If you are super super sensitive to spice, they can also make yours \"Completely Plain\". They just boil with Cajun flavor water and no sauce. \nIf you remember, I recommend bringing your own gloves (I buy them from Amazon.). The gloves they give you are thin and too big, they break easily while you are fighting with crabs or crawfish to eat. \nIf I don't have to see anybody next day, I order mine with \"Extra Garlic\" in it...

The other two locations on Spring Mountain are well rated because staff that actually acknowledged their customers. Unlike this location. \n\nWas the very first time for my family and I to come here because of distance, so we decided to come here. Came inside, no wait at all, no one greeted us, waited at the door for a good 7 mins, then sat us. Took our order after 10 mins, waiter didn't give us any specials, what they didn't have, what wasn't in season etc... Ordered 3lbs of Hot n Juicy seasoned shrimp mild and 1lbs of Crawfish with same seasoning. Order didn't come out till 30 mins later, without any lemons or butter, not even the salt and pepper. We basically had to ask for everything that was already supposed to be with our orders. Orders of food that wasn't ours kept coming to our table, waiters were confused and didn't know which orders belonged to what table. \n\nRipped into the bag of shrimp, which was over cooked, but was tasty and little spicy. Ripped into the crawfish and the bag only had 2 big pieces and the rest were about a size of a quarter some even smaller believe it or not. Then asked the server if they had bigger ones they can change for me or exchange it with shrimp instead. She then said \"oh they're not in season\" which she was supposed to mention before we ordered (pass visits in other location) also with Boiling Crab. If she had mentioned that the crawfish was out of season, then obviously we wouldn't have gotten that. \n\nWaiter then asked a fellow co worker (man waiter) on what to do. He came to our table\nAnd told us, there's nothing we can do, you can order what you want with the same charges that's on the menu or take it off the bill (very rude). So not only did we wait a while for our food, being the fact that my kids were hungry, they didn't acknowledge or take care of their customer needs by exchanging what we wanted since it was wrong on their end. \n\nAt this point I was already furious and wanted to leave, I then asked for the check right away, ruined our whole dinner, and they even forgot to get my check, so I went up to the register waited for them to print out my check, and they also charged me for extra butter and rice that I didn't ask for, but I still paid it, money wasn't the problem on my end. While I was waiting at the register, two customers got up from their seats and asked for hot sauce, forks and spoons. That shows lack of customer service. Something has to be done. Perhaps a more thorough customer service education? I would rather drive the miles than to come back to this place. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE. I will stick to Boiling Crab. Happy New Year!"

To start off typically you are supposed to receive the drinks before you receive the food. Nope got out the fries which I ordered CAJUN and did not have seasoning. The waitress insisted they were seasoned well I guess my memory is shot because I order the Cajun fries all the time. I ordered a pound of shrimp which was not hit when I got it. Whatever I tried to eat it anyways and the most of them were mushy. Which means they were not made fresh. I sent them back after eating 3 and received a 20% off. Again the server insisted that it was just that \"typically they get like that\" I eat at hot n juicy (off of sprint mountain) multiple times a month and have never had that problem.

The shrimp was very meaty, however, and cooked just right.  I wouldn't order the crawfish again but would do the shrimp.  The sausage was a good addition, but nothing special.  The potatoes were perfect, but the corn was overdone and mushy.  The fried catfish was again cooked perfectly, but we are not fans of the cornmeal coating (although it was again well done).  The cajun fries were prepared nicely with a good crunch.  I probably wouldn't buy the hot and juicy the next time as a little drier would probably work just as well.  But then again, I was licking my fingers so it couldn't have been that bad as it tasted great.\n\n1 lb. of shrimp is a lot of food and you should plan on sharing unless you are a really big eater.

HUGE, BRIGHT sign. really hard to miss =X located next to East Ocean Dim Sum. \n\nClean and doesn't smell (yet) XD still new. \n\nService wise. Good and Bad. Their service for seating is bad. Before i had arrived, 2 other parties waited a decent amount of time, to be sitting, instead of standing and waiting. I'm not sure how long they waited but i waited at least 5-10 minutes before they asked, and they didnt ask until a 4th party showed up and stood there before anyone asked. The service in terms of at table, was great. My water cup was never empty (almost usually full, which is surprising for a Hot n Juicy), food came out pretty fast as well. \n\nFood wise, since the last time i had Hot n Juicy (Spring Mtn & Valley View location), had ordered spicy. It was great but a little too much spicy, covering the natural seafood flavor, and my friend's stomach didnt like it too much XD. This time, decided to order medium instead. This locations medium, felt like a mild, if not a little lower. The sauce in the bag, seemed a little watery/diluted as well. \n\nMy mistake, i had ordered 3 lb of shrimp, medium, hot n juicy special, in 1 bag. Therefore, we couldnt really reach the sauce. Had asked the waitress for a side of sauce, which she told us they charge extra for sauce, and recommended to get like a potato or something for $0.60 and comes with the same amount of sauce. The sauce that came with the potato, seemed thicker and tastier (to me anyway) so that sauce disappeared quite fast XD. \n\nOverall, good experience. Aside from maybe the spice level difference, it matches the other locations (always worrisome for me, that quality would be different between locations sometimes) \n\nFor those who like watching sports, TV's everywhere, doesnt matter which direction you sit. I sat facing the front of the store, and i still had maybe 3 tv's in my view."

We were thirsty and we never had a chance to ask for refills he was there.\n\nFood was delivered timely and in the correct sequence. \nFrom that point they maintained an excellent wait time check on our needs and kept our beverages full. \n\nI stopped and asked one of the female wait staff what the name of our server was? She replied honestly \"we are are all your servers here sir, is there anything I can assist you with.\" \n\nFirst thought: Damn the wait staff here got game. \n\nFood:  4stars\nOrdered \n2 lb crab ordered different flavors and spice levels. \n1.5. Shrimp, diff flavor and spice levels.\nFull oysters on a half shell. Oysters were clean tasting but were disappointingly small.\nCorn tots, didn't care for them but other members of my party raved about it.\n\nThe service put this visit over the top at 5 stars.

We knew we wanted some hot peel and eat shrimp and some fried fish. We got a pound of shrimp with mild Louisiana spices which was a perfect blend for a shrimp boil. Just the right amount of spice and each shrimp was a decent size. We also got a 4 piece catfish basket with Cajun fries. Fish was good we only had one piece that had the cornmeal breading falling off a little... no biggie. OK, now if you need to order something on the side, definitely get the corn fritters. Little nuggets of fried corn love with a ranch dipping sauce. These are to die for. The service was attentive and filled our iced teas constantly. They had frequent check ins and greeted everyone who entered. Looking around you can see everyone splitting their time well between chatting and getting hands on there shellfish. We will definitely visit again in the future and bring friends."

We ordered two lbs of spicy hot n' juicy shrimp.  The waitress asked if we would like it in two bags I said \"yes please, and some corn in both bags.\" We also ordered some rice.  Our rice came out first and it was SERIOUSLY over cooked.  To the point where it had a weird taste.  A different waitress then came to our table and dropped one bag of 2 lbs of shrimp on the table with no corn.  I then got the attention of a different waitress and asked if we had the right food. I explained to her that the waitress we ordered from said we could have 2 bags of shrimp with 1 lb each and that we ordered corn.  She then took the bag back and came back with 2 bags of shrimp and no corn.  A different lady then brought out two things of corn soaked in sauce. Which was nice even though it wasn't in the bag.  Service was pretty terrible especially when I made it known exactly what I wanted from my initial food order to ensure the waitress would not have to run back and forth with different requests.  The shrimp tasted okay but was kind of mushy.  The rice was gross and super over cooked like I said before.  I will most likely try this location again only because my boyfriend enjoys the atmosphere."

We weren't greeted right away when we walked in, but it wasn't a big deal, plus the restaurant was packed and we barely had to wait because of our timing.\n\nYou aren't assigned a specific waiter/waitress.  Someone seats you/takes your order and basically if you need anything or want to order more, you flag down whoever is walking by.  This is both positive and negative; you never need anything until you realize no one is around, haha.  They have bibs and gloves available, but we didn't need the bibs, really.  I started my meal with gloves on, but they made it hard to peel the shrimp.\n\nWe ordered one pound of shrimp with medium hot-n-juicy and one pound with medium lemon pepper. We also ordered one order of Cajun fries.  Everything really is hot and juicy!  All of the prices for their seafood are based on the market price, so if you check out their menu online looking for prices, you won't find anything.  The cheapest seafood item was $10.99 (crawfish) and our shrimp cost $11.99/lb.  \n\nIt was delicious and we will certainly return!\n\n***Beware if you have a sensitive stomach like me, you will be on the toilet shortly after.

I have not had a bad experience yet. \n\nThe oysters with their special red sauce are some of the best I have ever had. I've had expensive oysters at fancy steakhouses not as good.

She is super cool, very friendly manager.  I just tried it by chance to say I went there. I had no idea how addicting it would become. The management is great. They always treat us good at all 3 locations in Vegas area. \n\nThe only advice I can give you is to wear a bib, wear gloves because you will get messy.  You will smell like the sauce the rest of the night even still so don't plan on leaving your house without showering like 7x.  \n\nI usually take all my friends/family that visit me to this place when they are in town when they just want to kick back and have a few beers and eat some good food."

This is one of the things I do by myself unless my wife wants to have fried chicken fingers.  How you limit yourself if you don't do seafood!"

Waitresses are not friendly and courteous AT ALL. Took a while before acknowledging us. No one even said \"thank you\" and goodbye when we left. Mind you, they didn't even know we were upset so we can't say we were rude customers. I was super hungry when we came after 2pm. When we finally got our food, they served the wrong one! No apologies whatsoever. I ordered extra Hot n Juicy sauce and as courtesy, they should have at least known to comp $1.75 for the wrong order, as a simple courtesy. \n\nTo the  manager, please train your staff to be friendlier and more pleasant. They give your resto a bad name. Thank you."

Would go 5 stars because I love it so much but there were a few bumps today with service and food\n\nwait time Was a bit long today for food. My belly was rumbling watching food go out to guests that came in 20 minutes after us. \n\nI'm not a fan of the system where one person takes your order, another runs the food and a random fills your drink. Our server never came back and I felt bad asking just anyone who passed for lemons and my bill. I'm assuming they split tips because it's the only reason I left one after being ditched by our server. They were all polite however.\n\nToday we got \n\n2lbs crawfish . Hot n juicy medium with a dozen sausages. I would say a 1/2 lb was just random claws with no body. Which is no good since they have no meat. I can't wait til spring when they get big! Otherwise they were fresh n tasty.\n\n1 lb of shrimp hot n juicy spicy. Way too mushy. Yuck. This is a problem I have run into at the other location too on spring mtn. You can't even peel them, they just mush up. I actually found myself researching that texture, I thought over cooking makes shrimp tough, I would take hard over mushy any day. It's the reason I switched to crawfish, but when I bring new people shrimp is always a go to. Fix this please! \n\nPlus a side of sauce for dipping... Yum\n\n1 lb of snow crab hot n juicy spicy. Good enough. Fresh. But next time I will spring for the king crab\n\nChicken nugget plate for the kid. Cajun fries were too spicy for him though. Oops my bad. \n\nLooking forward to bringing my sister in law in a few weeks."

What is really horrible is getting a bag clams in your favorite broth, instead of being served in a bowl, and then literally 4 out of every 5 shells comes out of the bag with no clam in it.  We had to go through the whole bag until the end result which was a small group of clam bodies sitting in the broth. Yes,  we did ask for bowls and they don't have anything to offer.  Worst seafood experience ever, see my picture."

The serving staff was untrained and inattentive. Let me give you a few examples:  the server brought the food to our party of six, one meal at a time, separated over a ten minute period; the waitress omitted an entree in placing the order so that one member of our group got the 2nd half of his meal after everyone else had finished; when the snow crab orders came, they were served without utensils with which to open them.and requests had to be made to supply them.  The food creates a pile of debris that nobody offered to remove until they were asked to do so.   There's a difference between \"hip\" or trendy and this do-it-yourself and you're on your own concept.  They definitely earned the  description as a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" experience!"

So, we had high hopes for the new one on Eastern.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor looks fantastic, they basically gutted the whole space and it's very modern looking.  Comfortable seating and lots of it.  Quite an upgrade from the previous tenant.  We had dinner around 7:15 on a Tuesday and it was about 3/4 full.  We were seated immediately and a server greeted us within 3 minutes.  Our drinks came out very quickly.  So far so good.......\n\nAfter this, the wheels kind of fell off.  My wife ordered a half pound of the steamed shrimp with garlic butter.  I decided I didn't want to get super messy, so I got fried shrimp with French fries.  I've had Hot N Juicy's fried shrimp before and loved it, so I didn't think it was going to be an issue.  Well, after about 7 minutes my wife's shrimp was at the table.  I then waited............and waited.  My wife was put in the position of eating her shrimp alone or waiting until my food arrived and then eating a cold dinner.  During this period, while we waited, the waitress basically ignored us.  I think she could tell how angry I was.  25 minutes after my wife's food arrived, I spoke with a supervisor.  She was nice about it, apologized that they were short staffed.  The fries then came out after about 30 minutes.  My shrimp didn't come out until nearly 35 minutes after my wife's food arrived.  This was approximately 40-45 minutes after I ordered.  So, that kind of turned us off to the whole meal.  It may be that my opinion was colored by the experience, but I also thought the food wasn't as good as the Spring Mountain locations.  The breading on the fried shrimp was thicker than last time I had it.  The Cajun fries were good however.  \n\nThey handled it well, we were only charged for the steamed shrimp in the bag.  The supervisor and our server were apologetic, but like I said, the meal was pretty much ruined.  I think we'll probably give this location another shot, but so far they seem to be having some issues."

That's right, utensils need not apply at this place. Forget your dinner etiquette and fancy silverware. Just simply suit up (with their fashionable plastic bib), bring your ten nimble digits, and dig right on in. \n\nThe breakdown: \nStep one -- Choose your favorite crustacean or shellfish. \nStep two -- Select your seasoning. \nStep three -- Pick your poison (i.e., spicy level).\n\nShrimp is highly popular and worth it. My family and I shared a pound of each of these: Louisiana style, lemon pepper, garlic butter, and the hot n juicy special. We got them on the minimal scale of spice. The last two were my favorite, although it was hard to keep track once we started dumping them onto the communal sea of smorgasbord. Don't forget the rice.\n\nMy bf doesn't care much for seafood, so he had the chicken wings with cajun fries, lol. I was surprised they even had poultry... My family also ordered two pounds of king crab legs and a pound of mussels, along with two orders of their pork rinds as appetizers. (Yep, we feasted.) The cajun flavor on pork rind's pretty spicy, but good if you can handle it. Our waitress completely forgot and we didn't even get the rinds until we were practically finished. Service seemed jumbled when we went. Overall, for a party of six, we were all sufficiently stuffed. \n\nSide note: Make sure to rub the lemon onto your hands and let it sit -- this will help alleviate the smell that sometimes will linger on your fingers for a day or two.

Waitress was extremely nice and patient. If only I got her name!!! I  had a very good time celebrating my birthday there. They even sang Happy Birthday!!!!"

I came with my two good friends who LOVE Hot & Juicy so might as well try it again. This time I REALLY enjoyed it. It wasn't too sweet and this time I was given S&P with lemon and it was SO GOOD. We also ordered rice, cajun fries, sausage, and chicken nuggets. I usually try to stay away from pork but I had to give the sausages a try. They were really good in the H&J sauce. I will definetly be coming back and treat my boyfriend to dinner here so he can give them another try too! Thank you Noemy for the generous free shrimp! :-)"

It seemed that the staff was running around with there head cut off. \n\nLet's start with drinks.  They failed to refill my drinks numerous times.  There were a few people responsible to refill drinks throughout the entire restaurant and they had no clue who to service.\n\nThe food.  The Pro: tasted the same as the other locations.  The Con: they messed up my order.  Forgot to add my sausage and corn.  In one of my bags they put the wrong spice and mix.  Overall I had to wait at least 15 mins for them to fix the order.\n\nOur waitress couldn't handle the tables she was assigned to.  She was a nice lady but she was very flustered and couldn't handle the pressure.  \n\nThis location is very nice compared to the rest.  They invested a good amount of money to make it look that way.  There were many TV's all around so it was great to catch the game during dinner.\n\nI will definitely give them another shot after a month to see if they have improved there service.\n\nMy suggestion:  perhaps they need to have all the employees play Diner Dash so they understand how to improve there flow lol"

They constantly check on our table and always made sure we had enough to drink.\n\nFood: after we learned a little bit about how the menu work, we decided to try a pound of the shrimp since they were out of blue crab and also the Cajun fries and Creole calamari. Everything was extremely delicious and the space was on point for the spicy shrimp. My only hope, and being the fitness girl, was that there was some kind of salad or greens option which was the only thing missing from the menu-I have to remember that not everything can be healthy\n\nExperience: we have eaten crab legs before in the comfort of our own home but it was really fun to experience hot and juicy with the plastic bib and the plastic gloves and the nonuse of utensils-it was like being a big kid out in public! Everything was awesome and we definitely want to come back when they have more seafood in stock so that we can try out the entire menu."

Its definitely a get your hands dirty kind of place but the food is cooked and spiced exceptionally well. \n\nI normally don't try to get too spicy but you can never tell HOW spicy it will be. There are some days where it'll be TOO hot and some days where its mild. So I took a chance and decided to do a pound of shrimp Hot N Juicy Medium. This day is wasn't too spicy so I ate absolutely everything with no problem. \n\nOf course, I tried using gloves to keep my hands clean but that failed so I opted to go gloveless. To get the smell of seafood off your hands, just squeeze some lemon juice on your spicy saucy hands and wash them in the sink. Thank god this location has sinks in the hall because its always so hard to open the bathroom doors with dirty hands. \n\nNo matter what, everything smells like seafood so I would suggest just eating everything there if you can because you don't want your car to smell like seafood."

When we asked the server about the order she stated they do not have a Garlic & Butter selection. My boyfriend didn't want to make a fuss so he was just going to eat it. The manager came over to explain the spices and was slightly condescending but she agreed to fix it and give him the the g&b sauce. OK problem solved...when the clams arrived the manager handed them to him and spoke to him like he was a child and again explained if  you don't specify that you only want g&b you will get the Cajun as well.  He bit his tongue because he was about to lose it.  I was kind of taken back by her tone as well.  When he started eating there was so much garlic that it as difficult to eat.  He was so over it and angry he  just did not want to talk to anyone. He felt it was done on purpose because it had to be remade.  I'm still not sure we will visit this location again as the Spring Mountain Locations have never given us any issues.  We hope they get it together and learn how to talk to customers in a respectful manner."

The family and I prefer medium hot and juicy flavor for everything.  Typically we order 2 lbs of crawfish and 2 lbs of shrimp.  Now they offer 1/2 lbs of food too, so that was a nice addition.   \n\nHere's the negative side. Man, this place gets busy,especially on holidays or since right now it's lent and on Fridays Catholics can't have meat .. I think they all decide to go to hot and juicy, just like we did.   Over 45 minute wait.  BAD IDEA.   \n\nNow I like I said, the food is consistent, so that's fine, but the service seems to go down the drain when they get busy.   It's like chickens running around with their head cut off.  Our bad experience was that we got all our food, but we were missing a bowl of rice.   3 different servers kept telling us \"the rice is coming, the rice is coming.\"  It literally came when we were almost done eating.   How difficult is it to scoop a bowl of rice ?? I can understand if they told me, we actually ran out of rice and we are making a fresh batch, because it took that long for our rice to come.  Drinks take forever to refill, it's just a mess.  I understand they are busy, but they gotta come up with a better plan for busy days.   \n\nTIP OF THE DAY:  Just come here on a regular day, you'll get better service and you'll enjoy the food !!"

Medium Hot N Juicy Shrimp and a side of rice. I think it was about $12.99 per lb for shrimp. This definitely filled me up! Unfortunately, I still prefer Boiling Crab's Whole-Shabang, but for the location proximity and little to no wait, this place is definitely the next best alternative.\n\nDelicious. Messy. Smelly. Garlic-y. Yup. This place has it all! Service was attentive throughout our visit and they were super friendly. My partner ordered crawfish too, which was tasty. They had a frozen crawfish or fresh option, which was interesting to see. When we went, I think it was about $7.99/lb for frozen and around $12.99/lb for live crawfish.\n\nIn total, we spent about $58 bucks including tip and tax for a party of 2.

If I rated this just on food I'd give it 4 stars. I ordered a pond of shrimp, crawfish and blue crab with cajun spice at the spicey level. Spicy wasn't too hot, I could have gone to the top level. The shrimp and crawfish were excellent, fresh, a good amount. Crab wasn't the best deal, just two in a pound but I figured that.\n\nWhat could have been better... ambiance is just OK. Maybe a few more booths and a little more space between tables. Needed some baskets for discards so we didn't have to dig through our old stuff in the bags. Service was a bit slow but it was a busy Mother's day Sunday.\n\nI'll go back again just for the shrimp and crawfish and try the extra spicy."

Very disappointing. The hot n juicy sauce was alright. It was a mixture of garlic butter, lemon pepper and what not. Make sure to shake up the bag for all the garlic at the bottom! Either way, the sauce was okay not that flavorful unless you pick up a crawfish with all the garlic on it. I had to order a extra side of spicier sauce.. We ordered 5lb and the crawfish was all small. Every 2lb comes with free corn and potato which was cool, but neither had any flavor either. I don't know. Maybe it was an off day, or it's just this location. Cause my friend who was also dining with me did not even touch her 2lb, she said Chinatown is much better? Idk but never again. Was not worth our 100$. We could've ate a buffet instead."

It was delightful to have such an amazing customer experience with her. The menu comes with the usual assorts of seafood creatures. I ended up with 2 lbs. of crawfish seasoned with Hot n' Juicy and extra spicy. It was good but I expected more of a kick. The Cajun spice was there but I didn't get the effect of volcano eruption from my mouth. I don't think the extra spicy even register on my Richter scale. If you're accustomed to Boiling Crab and comparing it to here, I would say Boiling Crab is spicier. The decor is quite different as well where Hot n' Juicy resembles an America bar and Boiling Crab looks like you got into a shipwreck. I will revisit this place and recommend it to anyone who has an appetite for Cajun seafood.\n\nTL,DR: Good customer service, flavorful but not spicy, ambiance is more modern, recommended for seafood lovers."

Oh... and if you have any little cuts or pick your cuticles... you'll feel the sting from the hot sauce.\n\n\nSo... as you walk in, you notice that all the tables are covered with white plastic and everyone is wearing bibs and most are wearing gloves.  Right off the bat, you know this is going to be an culinary adventure in some messy eating.  And oh man is it.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple... mostly shellfish... so if you are allergic I suggest you stay FAR away from this place.\n\nThey don't have salads on the menu... or really any type of veggie other than corn and potatoes... nothing green anyways.  So, don't go expecting to get a side salad with your shrimp.\n\nYou can get rice, french fries, sweet potato fries, hush puppy-like dish and bread to help soak up all the yummy sauce.\n\nWe got 1 lb each of shrimp and king crab legs with the Hot and Juicy sauce, Mild.  Their Mild is like most other places Medium.  It's got a nice kick to it and after eating a couple pounds of shellfish... your mouth is \"warm\".  (Good thing that Nielsens Frozen Custard is in the same shopping center.)\n\nSo you eat the shellfish with your hands... Peel and Eat right from the bag.\nThey serve it to you in big plastic bags.... no platters... no plates.  \nThey do have plastic spoons for the rice tho.\n\nThe sauce is Great!  And I want to go back and try the Lemon Pepper which I hear is really great too!\n\nThe shrimp and crab legs were meaty and had good texture... but it's all about the sauce and the experience.\n\nWe had fun playing with our dinner... and because you eat slower... you get full faster.  So, I think that's a good thing, right?  :)\n\nService was super friendly. \n\nThis would be fun with a group of people."

Shrimp being the cheapest ($12.00/lb) and king crap being the most expensive ($27.00/lb). You have to get at least one pound and can mix whatever you want and add corn on the cob, red potatoes and sausage for an extra few dollars. You then pick the seasoning you want and the heat/spice. They steam it all together in a plastic bag and bring it to your table. I felt that the seafood was good quality (we tried everything except the mussels) but with the seasoning and spice it all ends up tasting the same. For that reason, I didn't enjoy the meal itself as much as I normally enjoy eating seafood. The experience was different and sort of fun because you are eating out of a bag with your hands and it's really messy. The service was alright and we did end up ordering a side of their corn fritters which were delish. \nFor good seafood at a high price I would rather have it at a traditional restaurant or even a buffet. It was a one time experience for me."

We order crawfish, rolls, and crab legs.....crawfish came right away.....we had to ask 3xs for our rolls....and were told our crab would be out momentarily. We eventually got our rolls we asked for buter and were tolf they only had melted butter not cold. After 45 min they asked did we need anything else and we said we are still waiting for our crabs. They went to check and the kitchen forgot to cook them. So after another 20 min they finally came out and we were told they would comp the crab. When we got the bill we were still charged. We had to go find the original waitress (as we had 4 different ones) and she was like oops. So after they fixed that with the manager we finally left after being there for close to 2 hours.

Half of my shrimp was all mushy and I definitely lost my appetite. When my shrimp came in a bag, it was very securely tied at the top with a layer of two bags; that tells me that it's been in that sauce for way too long. I was super disappointed. The waiters we had were super attentive, although one of them seemed to be in a hurry because she kept grabbing the check when we haven't paid yet and asking if the check was ready when clearly we were still eating. Very unhappy with the hot n juicy on eastern, maybe the one on spring mountain is better. I used to like hot n juicy better than boiling crab but now I'm not so sure."

There is plenty of parking, and although the restaurant isn't huge, they had no problem accommodating our party of 10.\n\nThis is a messy, messy place.  Be prepared to be up to your elbows in spicy, juicy sauce!  Don't be intimidated, just dive right in.  Here's the deets:\n\n1.  Pick your \"meat.\"  They sell everything by the pound, according to current market price (posted throughout the restaurant). They have lobster, king crab legs, snow crab legs, mussels, clams, shrimp, and off course crawfish.\n\n2. Pick your spice level.  The waitress said that their sauces tend to be on the spicy side and they recommend going 1 level down to ensure you are comfortable.  If it's not hot enough, they can bring you extra sauce on the side.  \n\n3.  Pick your sauce.  They have cajun, garlic butter, and some others, including their special H&J sauce, which is apparently a mix of all of the other sauces.\n\nYou can also add sides - the cajun fries were really good.  They also have corn and potatoes that will be added to your bag.  Yes, bag.  Your food will come out in a large plastic bag!\n\nThey will also provide gloves if you don't want to get dirty, but where's the fun in that?!  There is a sink in the hallway leading to the bathroom where you can wash up when you are done - what a life saver!\n\nThe decor is nice and modern.  There is plenty of seating, with tables in the middle and large booths around the outside.  There was also a bar, but it looked seriously out of place and didn't look like there was anything going on behind it.\n\nCouple of things to note:  They add auto gratuity to large parties.  They will also only split checks 3 ways.  Our server was very friendly and offered to split them up for all of us, which actually created mass confusion and took a long time.  I felt bad for her!\n\nEveryone was super friendly.  If you've been hesitating to try this place out - DON'T.  It's something different that you should definitely try if you love seafood.  Although, they also had chicken nuggets on the menu if you don't!"

Because the meat is extra tender! Even when crawfish is out of season, they serve crawfish that is fresh frozen and it taste pretty decent. The next important thing about good crawfish is the sauce!!!!!! Hot N' Juicy is known for their over usage of garlic, but that's what makes it so tasty!

I will definitely be back!!\n\nI will probably try some new things every time I go back but the one thing that I WILL NOT change is where I sat. Molly is the best!!\n\nSeafood, beer, Molly, Seafood, beer, Molly....LOVE THIS PLAY!!\n\nSERVED BY MOLLY AND I'M SWEATIN' ...WHOOOO!!"

            "review": "I think crawfish is one of those things that people either love or hate. They have a texture, flavor, and look that you just have to get used to in order to enjoy crawfish. Personally, I have only started to try crawfish when it became popular here on the west coast with all of these new crawfish spots popping up all over. And again for me personally, I don't really like getting all messy while eating either, and I don't do well with spicy foods. \n\nSo how did I get here to Hot N Juicy with all those personal caveats I pointed out? Of course someone had to have a bday party here and I had to go. But, I do say I did enjoy the food here.\n\nI got a half pound of their garlic butter shrimp at the baby wimpy spice level and a pound of the crawfish of the same seasoning. Butter really does make everything great and although the baby wimpy spice was kind of spicy for me - I drank a lot of water and took french fry breaks between cracking open crawfish and shrimps. Next time I think I will get a potato \"extra\" to go with the crawfish because it looked tasty in my friend's bag."

Not sure if this location is owned by someone different than the other two in Vegas because it was a not-so-good experience. Everything from the service, to the food was just meh. \nMy absolute favorite thing about Hot and Juicy is the fries, oysters, snow crab, and the corn. Starting off the with cajun fries, the tasted the same - no difference, but how can you really screw up fries??? Next, the snow crab. It was sooooooooo BAD!!! There was no meat inside, it was smaller, the meat was so salty it made me want throw up and the white part of it looked moldy and disgusting. It was green and black, so disgusting and it left us with a sick stomach. As we were breaking them, there was never any meat inside of them. What's the point? This place is expensive and to get empty snow crab seriously enraged me. Next, the oysters. I' was pleasantly surprised with the oysters. They tasted very fresh and didn't even need hot sauce to slurp down! Lastly, the corn. It just wasn't good. Period. The kernals were small, it wasn't juicy and biting into it felt like it was just all core. \nAll of these lead me to believe that the owners are different because it seems like they're using all different things. I say, stick to the chinatown locations. Haven't been there in a while, hopefully things haven't changed."

I myself am a medium level gal all around and decided to just go for it!\n\nI ordered the snow crab legs, medium spice with butter and garlic. After putting on a bib and choosing to dig in with bare hands, the fun begins!  Plastic gloves are available if you choose not to get dirty!  The crab legs were good.

            "review": "Was visiting a friend in Henderson this weekend and we were headed to the Kabob Grill per his recommendation for lunch and I saw this place and got excited. I'm from the south and love me some crawfish and shrimp, fresh only of course. So when he said he has been meaning to try this place after I pointed it out we headed in and asked the important question. \"are your crawfish fresh and where are they from\".... we got a \"yes\" on the fresh part and a \"I don't know\" on the origin. Normally I only like Louisiana crawfish preferably non-farm raised....yes I know I'm a snob but when you grow up catching your own you learn a thing or two about your catch. We moved forward anyway. Since my buddy had never really had crawfish it was fun to show him how to eat them. 2lbs Hot and Juicy Mild Crawfish, 1lbs Hot and Juicy Mild Shrimp, and a Fried Catfish Basket for good measure because my buddy is a big eater and he was afraid that just the seafood would not be enough. Needless to say the table looked like a bone/shell yard when we were done. Which I always find amusing....\n\nNow I am from So Cal so I am a regular at a place called the Boiling Crab which is a chain with the same concept as this one. They fly their seafood in from Louisiana daily and they typically have large crawfish. I'm not sure where this places supply comes from but the crawfish were mostly really small with a medium one here and there. And as everyone knows eating crawfish takes some labor. So small ones make the process of getting full a lot harder. Also becuase they were soo small it was easy to overcook them a little which normally makes their tail ( where all the meat is ) pop off. I felt bad for my buddy because he kept grabbing ones that were head with no tail. He spent the later portion of the meal digging through the bag to try and find all the missing tails..... The flavor was good, not as good as Boiling Crab. But it was worth trying. I typically don't like citrus in my crawfish and shrimp and the Hot and Juicy Special seasoning had some citrus flavor in it. So if you are like me I would go with the Juicy Cajun or Louisiana Style I think, not sure because didn't try it but it sounds closer to what I normally get back here. The spice levels are a little deceiving which is typical at places like this. We discussed this with the waitress and she acknowledged that the medium was on the hot side and so on and so on..... so the mild has enough kick to get you by without not allowing you to taste the meat. Of course if you are a pepper head then by all means....blow it up!\n\nThe catfish was different both my buddy and I agreed. Not necessarily bad but just ok. You could tell it was frozen and maybe had not been properly defrosted before it was fried. The Cajun fries were good, better than typical regular fries. All in all it was a good experience.\n\nOh also if you are not used to eating a lot of butter/oil (which most people aren't) this place will be a little heavy for you. They use alot of butter in their sauces. So if you are like me you just use these places as a treat from time to time. But hey if you can handle it everyday carry on carry on....."

No need to drive to Chinatown to get your Hot N Juicy (or similar restaurant) fix. The one on Eastern is just as good. \nI'm going to assume you'll order the crawfish (because of the name of the restaurant), but I personally don't recommend it. The amount of meat in the crawfish is about a fourth of that in  the shrimp and the crawfish comes with more body parts (thus heavier non edible part, smaller amount of meat for the same weight and price? NAHHH). Also if it's your first experience the crawfish might freak you out.They look a little.... roach like. \n1lb. of shrimp will be enough for one person, 1lb of crawfish won't be. Crawfish enthusiasts will tell you the meat is juicier and to suck out the juice from the head to get the full experience, but to me it tastes the same. \n\nThe Hot N Juicy sauce is buttery with a slight kick. They'll advise you that they come out spicier than you expect. We ordered the baby spice and that was perfect for us. \nThe Cajun fries were way spicier than the baby spice shrimp we ordered and we were unable to finish it. If you're getting a spicy meat, I suggest getting the good ol' regular salty fries to give your palate a break. \nWe also ordered the calamari (baskets come with fries, calamari is not considered a basket). Good, but it didn't seem worth the price- same price as the lb. of shrimp we ordered. \n\nQuick service and no utensils. Just that alone sounds like a good restaurant to me."

So, me, my boyfriend and a friend of mine decided to have lunch here after church yesterday. I'm very happy we chose this place!  We were greeted and seated right away.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, always making sure we were being taken care of and had everything we needed.  Being that it was our first time, the waitress kindly explained the menu to us and told us all about the sauces and their intensity.  We ordered 2 dozen oysters and each had 2 pounds of crawfish as well.  The oysters were very clean and a good size.  With a little lemon juice and cocktail sauce, they were pretty tasty.  I ordered the crawfish with the Hot n Juicy \"mild\" sauce.  I was told that if I liked spicy that I should \"kick it down a notch\" because their sauces are one step up.  They weren't kidding.  The mild sauce had a nice bite to it.  I suggest if you don't like anything spicy, order \"less than mild\" sauce.  The bag of crawfish also comes with a potato and small corn cobb.  We didn't wait long for our food and began our crawfish adventure.  Before digging into my bag of hot n juicy goodness, I made sure to put on the recommended gloves and my plastic bib.  Once suited up, I opened the bag, pulled out one of the spicy crustaceans and went to town.  The crawfish were just like the name says, hot n juicy!  The mild sauce was a bit spicy, but nothing I couldn't handle. I actually like a little fire to my meals.  The crawfish were easy to peel,but very messy.  Thank goodness for the gloves and paper towels!  I devoured most of the bag, leaving just  a small amount on the bottom.  I liked the Hot N Juicy sauce, which is a mixture of all of the sauces on the menu, but I would like to try some of the other sauces on their own. All in all, I was not disappointed.  My friends and I really enjoyed our lunch at Hot N Juicy Crawfish and will definitely be back again real soon!"

The shrimp and crab legs are awesome, but the namesake crawfish are tiny - just ok. Prices are pretty reasonable and you get a ton of food.\nDon't wear your best shirt - it's messy!"

This was my first time going here and I ordered 3 pounds of crawfish which were 10.99/pound. I ordered two of the Hot N Juicy flavors and 1 pound of Louisiana. The crawfish were large and it was messy and everything I thought when it came to eating them. Only one of my bags had a piece of corn while the other two pounds just had crawfish. I ate them the traditional way where I ate the tail meat and sucked the heads. I ordered butter which was 1 dollar extra. The problem I guess I have is the amount of meat that come from crawfish and the amount of money that will be spent on the amount it takes at least me to get \"full\" is not worth the price of admission. Other than that the main thing the crawfish were actually good and you come for those.. so give it a try .. but make sure you get those bags filled with more corn."

I typically enjoy a low sodium diet with lots of veggies, so you can understand why a restaurant of fried and sodium filled proteins might not appeal to me. But the plastic covered tables and the bibs and plastic gloves and giant bags of super saucy seafood drowning in butter and garlic that you smash and eat with your fingers is just a fun way to spend the evening. I definitely enjoyed watching my friend get covered in seafood and Cajun sauce (literally covered, I was wiping it out of her hair and armpits, though in her defense she'd had 3 beers after an afternoon of champagne). \n\nThe service is spot on with the exception of waters. They'd much rather serve you beers than keep the water cups filled. But very friendly wait staff. We had the Cajun calamari, which tasted like spicy Cheetos, and the corn fritters, which were very good. We ate the king crab and clams in garlic butter medium spice. It was too much spice and salt for me and I couldn't help my friend eat the pound of crawfish. Also, the crawfish faces creeped me out. We both were burping garlic for 2 days after. \n\nI personally won't be eating here again. Once home I dove into a salad faster than a fat kid with cake. I'm obviously not their target audience. But I recommended this place to my brothers and I think it'd make a fabulous first date location. What better way to really get to know someone than to see how they handle being showered in seafood sauce."

You can add corn, sausage, and potatoes to be cooked in the sauce also. They also carry different fried food baskets like catfish and chicken nuggets.  The food comes in bags and you eat right out of the bag and leave the trash or mess on the table. There is also wine and beer at this location as I believe there is a bar you can sit at.\n\nThis isn't for everyone but I love it. Sure it sucks you and your car might smell garlicky but to ding them is silly. \n\nI don't have much more to say. I had a stellar time here the other night. Sometimes the other location almost over boils the shrimp as the meat gets stuck to the shell but not here. \n\nThe main reason I enjoyed myself so much was the staff. We couldn't stop talking about how nice, helpful, and efficient every one was. \n\nIf I had one thing to nit pick about it was sort of lame my fries came out awhile after the shrimp but it was still the best time I've had at any location. \n\nI'll definitely return."

Pick Your Cravings...Market Prices per pound. Shrimp is the only one you can order 1/2 pound of. Make note of the list of current prices posted as you enter.\n\n2. Pick Your Spice Level. ..Mild-Extra Spicy\n\n3. Pick Your Seasoning. ..Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Butter, and their house blends from what I remember. \n\n4. Roll up your sleeves, tie the bib, and put on the plastic gloves provided for you. There's no dishes or utensils so just dig in!\n\nSince it was my first time here my server guided me thru the menu. My pick: Steamed Shrimp ..Seasoning: Garlic Butter...Spice Level ..mild ..thats all my palate can take. My server read off the sides and Corn Fritter aka Hush Puppies is what I picked. .I don't remember nor did I really didn't pay attention to what else or how much everything was ..my bad. \n\nMy order of shrimp came out in a plastic bag nice and HOT. \n\nThe shrimp is pretty meaty and when you sink your teeth into it's JUICY!\n\nThe MESSY part of is that you get to eat with your hands and do the work  peeling the skin off the shrimp. It's messy but  buttery garlicky good!\n\nThe staff did a good job tag teaming. Host greeted and seated everyone in line pretty quick. The servers did great.  I was constantly checked up on. It was a fairly short wait for the main entr\u00e9e to come out. Docked star though because side order came out midway through my meal. I had noted that fried items were a problem after reading some of the reviews here. Looks like the back house  still short a fryer. \n\nThe dining area is pretty big. Seating wise it's great for groups.  You have your choice of sitting in either booth or table that's covered in sheet of plastic. \n\nGood thing for laid back atmosphere. Cause using no utensils can get messy. NOTE: There's a sink located just outside the restroom so you can clean . Spent just under twenty bucks for lunch. Super  deal for my meal!"

No one ever regrets it though."

I like that this one seems more for locals and not crowded with tourist.\n\n The shrimp were cooked perfectly, I find that the other locations tend to over cook them. I like the lay out of this one a lot more then the others. \n\nI was impressed overall considering they have only been opened for only 2 hours! \n\nMy only complaint is that the sauces didn't really seem the same which is why I took a star off. However that star will work its way back up since its only their first night open!!"

You will be seated at a spot in the restaurant with a table top covered directly in plastic, provided with plastic bibs and a roll of paper towels.  There are no plates here, your food comes out straight to you in plastic bags full of wonderful spices and aromas.  No frets here it is very clean.  \n \nIf it is your first time visiting let the waiter or waitress explain to you have everything works (the staff are very helpful and they know their seafood and flavors).  They specialize in Crawfish but you can have any of the following: shrimp, Dungeness crab, blue crab, oysters, king crab, snow crab, lobster or crabs.  Then you pick a seasoning and a spice level.  That night my husband and I enjoyed shrimp hot n juicy spice level medium, crawfish hot n juicy spice level medium and crawfish garlic butter spice level medium.  Hands down the hot n juicy combo was are favorite, it hits all the taste buds just right and shall I sum it up by saying umami.  The Garlic butter is okay but if I try it again I will get it spicy.  ***If you do order two pounds of crawfish you will receive on corn on the cob and potato in your flavor bag and it soaks up the flavor amazingly.***  The crawfish here are not tiny and their shrimp are a great size too.  We also order their calamari and was pleasantly surprised to find it extremely fresh, it taste like it is hand dipped in their own batter and then fried (not the pre-frozen kind).  If you have children that do not know how to pick crab, shrimp or crawfish this is not the place because you will end up doing all the picking for them and they will do all the eating."

This young blonde girl who started as our waitress (I told them to not send her back) seemed to be on drugs or left her brain at home. We ordered 1 lbs of baby spice shrimp butter garlic, 1 lbs of lemon pepper medium, 1 lbs of lemon pepper medium with corn, 3 rice, 2 waters,  and 1 unsweetened tea. First she brought me raspberry tea, corrected her it was unsweetened tea, brought it to me with sugar on the side. Smh. Food got here and got about 1 1/2 lbs of the butter garlic that was the complete opposite of baby spice. Then the other 1 lbs bags were about half a pound, and one was missing corn. Had to constantly ask for refills on my tea. My auntie wanted the least hot spice, and got the hottest on the menu, no wonder she was so miserable by the time we finished. I will NEVER come back to this location,  now as I'm writing this and get my check, she brings my check with charging me 4 lbs. Looking for the GM. This place is a joke. Stand by..... Ok so GM tried to fix the ticket and messed that up. Ended up leaving being charged for 2lbs, 3 rice, 1 corn. Sure hope this GM can turn this place around."

After you are seated, they start you off with your drinks, bibs, and if you request for them, gloves. \n\nAt this location, they have a new spice level! \"Baby Spice,\" right before \"Mild.\" I always take my order mild, which is only at about a 'hot cheetohs' level of spice, so I'm guessing baby spice would not be spicy at all.\n\nMy usual order is a pound of mild, garlic butter shrimp with a side of cajun fries and deep fried calamari. If your skin is sensitive like mine, I wouldn't suggest ordering spice levels higher than mild, otherwise your lips will swell!\n\nThe service here is average on somedays, good on most. They once gave me a basket of cajun fries with half of the fries being cold. I usually wouldn't mind, but that order was for my boyfriend's mom, so I asked for them to heat it up for us and the waitress seriously rolled her eyes at me! Lol.

What came out of the kitchen was so hot it made me tear up, and I adore spicy food. I was lucky to even get that since it seemed that our server had forgotten to ring in my order.  I sat while everyone else at the table ate their dinners. We made many attempts to get our server's attention and finally did so after about 15 minutes.  We had to remind him twice to refill our drinks and had to argue about our order to prove to him that I was indeed missing my food.  \n\nFifteen more minutes passed and still no sign of my crab legs, so we asked to speak to a manager.  To which we were told that the manager was fixing the soda machine.  So he sent a \"lead\" to our table.  She told us that there had been a mix up and that they would START making my crab legs now.  So the server had done nothing in the last 30 minutes to rectify this issue. By now, I was furious.  I didn't even want to eat the food that finally showed up.  \n\nI went to the seafood market the next night and bought clams, lobster, shrimp and crabs.  We had an old fashion seafood boil in our own house for less than HnJ and it was all delivered on time.  Save your money and get creative.

Serve everything on and in plastic bags, no silverware, even the cups are disposable.  No dishes to purchase or clean.  And after all those savings the food is still sold at a premium prices.  When we go we usually end up paying around $30 or so a person.  Went to the new location on Eastern a couple of times and the service is not good there.  Both times the place wasn't busy and both times it was poor service.  I actually had to get up and go find someone in the back to get drink refills."

Plenty of delicious food to share! The only thing I felt that could have helped the meal was a great sauce for the sweet potato fries- they were served with ketchup, which was ok, but could have been better. The corn fritters were delicious, the shrimp- \"over the top\" and the service was perfect!!!! Aubree was our server and she was so attentive and friendly! We can't wait to come back and hope to get served by Aubree again!"

After 1.5 hrs , our birthday boy really wanted to go, we were seated. Ordered shrimp crawfish and oysters plus corn fritters. Fritters were great. Oysters fine best part already opened. Shrimp best bang for money. Crawfish small . Bad taste leaving their calendars at the table .Restaurant is way over priced. I could see eating at this type of restaurant in Louisiana for the experience  but we will not be back in Henderson."

I usually go to the Spring Mountain Location and have zero Complaints.. Yesterday however two dumb down.. First when I walked in the hostess up front did not greet me at all instead asked if I had cover up... I immediately looked at her as if she was crazy.. First let me start off by saying I was wearing a Romper my boobs were not out or was my stomach showing.. It was a Romper I got from BEBE.. still no greeting instead saying I will have to ask you to leave if you don't have one talk about embarrassing right in front of my friend.. I'm again like what.. I figured I will just go to my car and grab my jacket but I was blown away.. Secondly my friend had to track down a waitress to refill his drink 3 times.. No one came over to our table once the food was delivered.. Just terrible.. Needless to say my normal 5 star review gets a  one star and that is only because I cannot give a zero star review.. I will not be returning to Hot N Juicy I will switch to Boiling Crab from now on.. Hot N Juicy no no from here on out .. You just lost a long time loyal customer.. No more Hot N Juicy Special Sauce I will now be a Whole Shabang Lover !!!!"

The food is amazing and the service is impeccable, as always. We ordered the Hot N Juicy (medium spicy) seasoned crawfish, which were small and frozen to start with, but had an amazing flavor and texture. The perfect crawfish season is Fat Tuesday (2014 = March 4) thru July 4th - so we are eating these delictable critters at an unseasonable time of year. BUT still quite yummy!\n\nWe love restaurants where all of the staff helps all of the patrons, and you don't have to wait for \"your server\" to be notified of your request. This is the perfect example of this customer service philosophy. Not only are you not waiting for anything, the entire staff stops by your table frequently to ask if you need anything. The assistant manager, Katie (totally adorable girl), even stopped by our table to make sure we had everything we needed - PERFECT! \n\nThis wonderful addition to the Hot N Juicy chain will not disappoint. If you love Cajun food, you must give your taste buds a treat, and check out this new addition to the Hot N Juicy chain, just south of the 215 on Eastern. Yummy!!!"

            "review": "So happy they opened one on my side of town!\n\nWhen we got there, there were still tables open. We had a party of 8, but the guy server refused to seat us until at least half of our party was present. Which the eighth was a four month old baby that wasn't even going to eat. It was understandable until the tables started filling up and the only table left was ours that a girl server purposely left reserved for us. Instead of the guy server out of courtesy asking us if the rest of the party was here, which they were, but were trying to find parking, (the parking isn't that great in this plaza by the way) he was pretty darn close to just seating the next party that arrived. I felt that was rude in and inconsiderate as we were patiently waiting. The least he could have done was ask if they were here or not. They could have been walking to the door and he probably would have just seated the other party if it weren't for my husband telling the girl server that our party was parking. That was frustrating.\n\nWe finally sat down and ordered. When it came to us waiting for the food, it was taking a lot longer than I had experienced at the other two Hot N Juicy's on Spring Mountain. We were probably waiting about 45 minutes to an hour. We only ordered shrimp and the rest were chicken baskets. The other two would have the food out a lot quicker.  Definitely no more than a 20 minute wait after ordering.\n\nEvery time we needed something we had to keep looking for our server as he never really came to check up on us. \n\nAt this location, I felt the service was about a 1 1/2 stars. I love the food and the location which bumped my rating to 3 stars. I love how they have a sink in the hall to avoid the clutter in the bathrooms. I would choose this location as my least favorite out of the three, but since it's less than 10 minutes away from where I stay, I will be returning for that reason."

The hot and juicy seasoning was very delicious but I think next time I will try the lemon pepper. The shrimp didn't really absorb the flavoring as well as the crawfish did. I will definitely return. Service was excellent, especially Jessica! She was attentive, personable and more than made up for the slacking of some of the others. Its too bad they pool tips because obviously others are riding on the backs of others (Angela)."

This time we had a wonderful server who's name escapes me (Brooke?) but she was very helpful. My wife had never been before and opted for a pound of Crawfish. I went with the shrimp (more meat), we shared a dozen pieces of sausage tossed in the hot'n'juicy sauce in her bag, and we also had an order of the corn fritters (a MUST have with your meal). The biggest thing for me was the recommendation from our server to toss my shrimp in the lemon-pepper sauce. It. Was. Awesome. \n\nMy wife's only complaint was that the crawfish was a lot of work for little reward, but that's not the restaurant's fault. If you want more meat, get the shrimp. If you want to try new things, get the crawfish or lobster or any of the other delicious things they have. You can either have your fish tossed in a bag with the sauce of your choice, or order the sauce on the side. You also eat with your hands but they do have a washing station near the restrooms if you decide to go gloveless. \n\nAll in all another great experience at Hot'n'Juicy. DEFINITELY go here."

            "review": "It was once upon when I visited the other Hot n' Juicy location on Spring Mountain and Decatur. If my memory serves me right I had no complaints with the food, the service was fine, and the concept of eating shellfish out of a bag was kind of cool. One thing that I remember vividly of the time was the shower I took that night I ate the meal and how much my hair smelled like garlic and how my clothes were marinated with the smell of the restaurant. Although the food and experience was mediocre, I felt like all the work to get rid of the stench was too much.\n\nLike I said, though, that was once upon a time. The other night, I was in the mood to eat some shrimp; some really spicy shrimp. I was out in the Henderson area visiting the in-laws and I searched Yelp for Hot n' Juicy with the intention of visiting the same location I had gone long ago, knowing full well that I should to gear up for the occasion and what would be required after. To my surprise, however, a location that was much closer to where I was popped up in the GUI and I decided to try it out.\n\nWhat a great decision! This location has recently opened up I have learned. The inside of the place looks modern and contemporary, they have nice big booths for dining and quite a bit of seating. We arrived right around 8:30 to 9:00 pm and there was about a 15 minute wait, which I was expecting for a Sunday night. There was plenty of open seating at the bar where I would have sat had my wife and I not brought our little niece along to enjoy the experience. There were 3 to 4 flat-screen TV's on each wall meaning if you every wanted to eat spicy seafood while you catch a game, there wouldn't be a bad seat in the house. \n\nPart of the experience was identical to that of the other location on Spring Mountain and Decatur; the tables are wrapped in plastic for you to discard the shells of the fish, gloves are given upon request, no lids for the drinks (although, you may be able to request one), and a little plastic bib to remind you that you hardly need to be careful while you eat.\n\nAnother part of the experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed, that I couldn't recall (or perhaps didn't exist) from my previous visit to the other location; there was a nice ventilation system in this place. The air was only mildly filled with the flavorful aromas simmering from their savory sauces.\n\nOk, now the reason I really wanted to write this review: THE FOOD. I got was I was coming for; I got my shrimp. However, I don't remember the food being this good! I ordered two pounds of shrimp. In one bag we went with the Louisiana sauce \"spicy\" and in the other we got the\"Hot n' Juicy special sauce \"spicy\". Although they were both good, the house sauce was exceptionally good. I found myself dipping the Louisiana flavored shrimp in the remnants of what was once a pound of of Hot n' Juicy Special flavored shrimp. I probably looked like a rabid dog while I sucking out whatever was contained in the heads of the shrimps just to enjoy every last drop of the sauce. I was going to the empty out the bag as a drink, but by that time my wife was already giving me the look that meant I needed to take it down a notch; so I complied.\n\nI walked out of that place a happy man. I didn't smell like I spent a couple hours in a garlic-steamed sauna and I had just enjoyed some of the best tasting shrimp I had ever tasted. Needless to say, I'll be back, and most likely to this location."

However, it is done well, the food is fresh and they have a good selection. Remember that some seafood is seasonal so they may not have everything on the menu year round. My only complaint is that if you order an appetizer it usually comes out at the end of the meal, we've been twice and this happened both times. Not sure why, as they refill drinks quickly and overall service is good, I think the fried foods take a back seat to the steamed foods. Modest beer selection, but they have sweet tea so that wins them an extra star rating."

Typically get 2 lbs shrimp in garlic butter or a medium hot n juicy with a dozen sausage and side order of rice. HNJ delivers a consistently good experience.  Perfect for watching football or any sport with all their TVs. Will be back on our next seafood craving!"

We even took some home with us. \nOur waiter Jefrey was outstanding explaining the different kinds of sauces and letting us sample everything before ordering. Good friendly guy. \nWould definitely recommend this place"

            "review": "Just wow. If anyone has ever been to New Orleans and appreciates creole food, Hot N Juicy at Planet Hollywood is THE place to go if you're trying to get your Cajun seafood fix! \n\nThe etouffe here literally tastes like it was made straight from the bayou and served at your table. So flavorful and has a nice kick of spice... and I'm not really into spicy foods. But this is just the right amount. PS - if you don't know what etouffe is, it resembles a sort of gumbo-like dish. It's amazing.\n\nThe regular fried calamari was really good and comes with a side of marinara and lemons. We were hesitant to order the Cajun calamari because it's a little on the spicier side.\n\nI was afraid that the pound of shrimp with a mixture of all sauces (aka it's called the Hot N Juicy sauce) with baby spice was going to be too spicy for me. But baby spice was great. My heart was happy. PS - there's different sauces you can choose from like garlic butter, lemon pepper, Cajun, etc. or you might as well throw them all together and savor the flavors."

We planned to go to the Chinatown location, but saw this one. \n\nThe Drool - 1 lb Crawfish, 1 lb Shrimp, dozen Andouille Sausages,  2  Corns and 2 Potatoes  1/2 lb Snow Crab & Cajun Calamari \n\nWe went with the Hot & Juicy Medium spice. I thought the food was good, but seems they toned down the spice level. It made my lips tingle, but thought it would have been a bit more spicy. We enjoyed everything, but wasn't too fond of the sausage.\n\nWill be back when I return to Vegas!"

We originally started \"light\" with 1Lb of King Crab and 1/2 Lb of shrimp but ended up enjoying our meal to the point where we had to have more. Even though we were rushing to catch a show, we could not resist ordering another round of the very flavorful crab in the Hot N Juicy seasoning with some corn fritters on the side. The seasoning is sooo good that you will want to sop it all up with everything in site. Awesome place to go if you like seafood with a kick! Yum!"

It wasn't too busy but for some reason our service was rushed. The food was good as always no complaints there but the waiters didn't seem too interested in helping us with our problem that we had with our bill. There was an extra item on the bill and it wasn't a big deal we just couldn't seemed to get help for a while with removing it. Overall it was still good experience because of the meal we had, a drink or two wasn't a bad option either."

I order the same thing every time I'm in town which is a pound of shrimp and clams in the Hont n Juicy sauce at a mild level. Let me tell you that the mild is actually pretty spicy itself. I would compare it to most other Cajun seafood spots' medium. So if you're not big into specimens, the baby spice may be good enough for you. Anyways, the seafood here always seems to be fresh and Cooke just right. If you're really hungry and can't wait long for your seafood, I would order the Cajun fries - they are so yummy!!"

Here I paid $52 +tax and it was the size of a get your feet wet... Had no flavor and I was told by the hostess it was FROZEN not fresh shrimp, crab and crawfish... The corn was also frozen had that chewy stick to your teeth texture.  Frozen crab was so salty i had to drench it lemon to even it out.   Totally left feeling unsatisfied..."

The waitress that helped me out was very helpful and nice. \n\nGot home all excited but we CANNOT eat any of it! None of it. Everything was too spicy. My wife loves spicy seafood, took one (1) bite and her face turned red right away. Again, we ordered \"mild\" so we just couldn't believe how spicy everything was. I understand the name of the restaurant is Hot n Juicy but this is just insane. \n\nCalled them up to see what can be done since we had just paid close to $85. They said that they \"cannot control the batch of peppers they get\" and it can get really spicy. I was also advised to cook our food up again in butter. So our parents are currently recooking the meal that we paid for. Feeling very frustrated. \n\nI'm not sure if it would've been different if we ate in the restaurant and if this is the norm for their \"mild\" spiciness. If it is, I'm not sure why they even have that as an option and please be warned that it is VERY HOT!"
