We decided to come here mainly because it was close to us and we didn't feel like walking to far.  The menu also seemed promising and it was!  Our server was so nice and even talked to us for a bit about the restaurant. Wish I remembered his name!  From what he said the owner was the guy who owns smash burger so it pretty neat to try the new spin on things since we've had the burgers before.  We went for the 2 fries (regular and sweet potatoes), wings, and potstickers. Everything was pretty good and definitely hit the spot! I'd say sit in the patio the atmosphere is great and you get a nice view of the strip."

There were no glasses for whatever reason, so we had to wait for quite a while for our drinks.  No big deal, our server kept us informed and did a great job at keeping us happy.  \n\nThe food could be better, and I am sure that it will improve.  We had the truffled mushroom flatbread (if I can remember correctly).  It was tasty, although a bit oily.  Not to the point of being inedible, but more than to my liking.  I gave feedback to our waiter simply because if I was opening a restaurant, I would want to know as well.  Overall taste was pretty good though.  \n\nThe patio here is superb for people watching!  \n\nIn a nutshell, I am always understanding when a restaurant first opens.  I would try this place again."

            "review": "This place is AWESOME. We woke up early on a Saturday after a long night to hit the strip before it got really busy. We were on a mission for bloody mary's and breakfast. Tom's Urban was across the street from our condo so it was a perfect location. We arrived and the hostess was this adorable gal whom I didn't catch the name of, but she was bubbly and fun. She sat us on the patio and brought us water. Our waitress arrived and took our drink order. She was able to give us recommendations on what the most popular drinks were or what she prefers. We got our first round of drinks, and my only complaint was that my bloody mary wasn't spicy enough. They didn't have a huge selection of hot sauces, but we made due. The bloody mary mix is house made and delicious. I ordered the traditional eggs benedict with the cheddar polenta grits. The grits were amazing. Super flavorful and creamy. The benedict was delicious and the eggs were poached to perfection. It was the perfect breakfast to start our day. We were all more than satisfied. The service and the food were both on point to our expectations, and I will most definitely visit on my next trip to Vegas."

They have plenty of fans and misters to keep you cool. Great area on strip for people watching. JoAnn our server was awesome. She made several recommendations and even questioned my manhood when I ordered a regular sized beer so I manned up and a red bull vodka to show her. Haha! I ordered a few more after too. She was super cool. I stopped by a week later but didn't run into her. \nThe food is great. I ordered an egg white omelette and they brought me a regular one but they fixed it. Took a while but manager came by and told me my meal was on the house. Sweet! I still had to pay for drinks but I was like nothing beats free. I ordered a kale salad with it as well; just cutting carbs. I did share the house made pop tart which was off the hook. \nAfter a long fun day at the pool I brought my friends here for dinner. Sat on the patio on the strip. That was very entertaining bc of all the debauchery happening. It's Vegas so it's a normal Friday night. All of the food was delicious. \nStopped by on my 3rd morning and ate at bar area. Laurie took care of me. She was awesome! She knows her golf courses in the area and gave me a bunch of recommendations for my golf trip the following week. Funny thing happened again when I ordered the egg white omelette. They brought me a regular one. They fixed it but I payed for it this time. It was 8am and some guy was doing shots at the bar. Overall, I really liked the atmosphere and the food was great. Best part was the service. I stopped by again a week later to see Laurie but she was off. I had a great time golfing. Thanks, Laurie. P.S. Badlands was brutal."

            "review": "I had the perfect opportunity to come back to Tom's Urban after my yelp experience with family in town visiting from the 808. We were looking for somewhere close since they were staying at Excalibur Hotel. I mentioned Tom's Urban. It great spot for family dining open area, diverse menu (even have kids menu), and something that don't see back in 808. It just walk across the street. So they were down for it. I was excited go back not that I never got my fix in or tasted enough of the menu. It always good idea go back after yelp event get honest opinion minus all the special treatment. \n\nMe I would give it 4.5 star review. The ambience was the same vibe one that really enjoy the spacious dining room, my niece and nephews LOVED that fact had wide screens all spread out in the restaurant (one that was playing music videos; yup like they even made music videos anymore!?!?!?), so keep the kids interested cause late at night they were fading from long day of soccer tournament day, and the wood decor is awesome more so when understand the history behind it. Our server not sure if she worked the yelp event looked familiar. She was awesome, love the excitement she brings to her job, friendly, passionate, upbeat, free spirit, professional, and interactive with the kids. She notice my nephew soccer warm up jacket and was asking if they were here for soccer tournament. She plays soccer herself and was telling us about tournament she went down to AZ of recently or something. The bottom line was love the interaction she engaged with us. It make the whole experience that much more memorable plus she is very professional. We never had empty glasses answered all of my family questions since was their first time, and was on it. \n\nFood I ended up going with familiar dish one that had at yelp event. I went with the street tacos. I went with three combination of pork belly and two al carbon. You can order one, two, three, or all five different ones. That was way too much food. It was delicious. It tasted just as good as just few days prior at yelp event. My family visiting they had couple of pizzas, grilled cheese, and chicken fingers. They all enjoyed their food. The only thing would say is the chicken fingers not that eye appealing but then again plain old chicken fingers. \n\nThe only reason fell short of yelp perfection was we must have been the only people at the restaurant. We got there late around 10pm surprise for Saturday night kind of empty. We got seated fast, server she was prompt, awesome, and on it. Once she put the order in no fault of hers took over thirty minutes. I could understand if was swamped but the place was empty. Anyway long day we were all starving so might have been short but we left the restaurant past 11pm. Server apologize. It nothing that would stop me from coming back or bringing out of town visitors for some of the ono grinds."

            "review": "This place is so inconsistent. We had four two-for-one 33 oz beer specials, so we went there two different days. The first day, they gave us four 22 oz beers for free instead of giving us four 33 oz beers and making us pay for two. The second day, they told us that they weren't sure how the coupons worked, but that they would figure it out and make it work. Then, halfway through drinking our beers, they said the coupons don't work, but that they would give us one beer for free. Really, we only had to pay for one extra beer, but it was frustrating that they told us that we could use it and then told us we couldn't after we had already ordered. Service was also very slow, despite that only a quarter of the bar was full. They also had to comp an entire table near us because of bad service."

The food was actually good and the service was freindly and fast.  The wait to get in was a different story.  They told us half and hour and took twice as long.  When we finally got seated, we noticed it was only half full, so why did we have to wait?  When I bought this to their attention, they said they didn't have enough waiters.  First of all, it was the weekend.  What kind of place staffs half the waiter needs on the weekend?  Then it was March Madness, the busiest weekend of the entire year.  Boneheads.  One star for the dufus management and 3.5 stars for the good food and waiter."

            "review": "I was so, so disappointed but that was probably because the menu looks so good and all the descriptions are mouth-watering. \n\nLet me back up. First, the service. Our waiter was actually really nice and explained thing to us, but we had to wait a bit to get seated in this awkward area. That was not an issue though, just something to mention. No stand to indicate where we should wait.\n\nNext, the menu. It looked amazing! So delicious and descriptive and imaginative. Now if only they could follow through on the execution, it would have been a wonderful meal.\n\nWe ordered Calamari, small plate mac n cheese with the pork, side of creamed spinach and a burger. The calamari was the best thing by far. My BF said the burger was good, but I didn't have a bite so I can't judge. The side of creamed spinach was nice, but not great. Just sort of eh. The mac n cheese was made with american cheese. Or velveeta. Either way, it was just odd. I mean, kinda tasty in the way that I could eat it and didn't need to send it back, but not so much that I would ever order it again.\n\nOverall, I think I may skip this place next time around, unless I read they get their act together and get some better quality food."

Von 16-19 und und von 23-02 Uhr. In der ersten Phase, steigt der Preis bis 19 Uhr jeweils um einen Dollar und in der n\u00e4chtlichen Phase, f\u00e4llt der Preis, umso sp\u00e4ter es wird. Witzige Idee.\n\nDie Preise sind ingesamt f\u00fcr Vegas aber sehr moderat und angenehmen. Die Speisenauswahl ist gro\u00df und bietet amerikanische K\u00fcche, aber auch internationale Gerichte.\nDas Bier-Men\u00fc ist auch hier riesig und bietet eine gro\u00dfe Auswahl an Bieren vom Fass.\n\nDie erste Empfehlung beim Essen sind definitiv die Lobster & Shrimp Mac'n'Cheese. Diese war der Hammer und mit dem Lobster-Fleisch und Shrimps toll. Die Portion war wirklich gro\u00df und f\u00fcr 19 Dollar vollkommen angemessen.\nAuch der Hangover Slopper war klasse. Ein Angus Beef Burger mit allem was so auf einen Burger geh\u00f6rt, dazu noch eine Cheese-Sauce und zwei Eiern. Auch eine Bombe, aber super lecker und mal etwas ganz Anderes, als andere Burger. Hatte ich in der Form noch nicht. Siehe meine Fotos. Ansonsten sind die Mini-Slider auch gut, drei kleine Burger f\u00fcr den Hunger zwischendurch.\n\nBesonders zu empfehlen ist im Tom's auch noch der Baby Kale (Gr\u00fcnkohl) Salat, als Caesar Variante mit Chicken. Gr\u00fcnkohl als Salat ist wunderbar und hoffe, das es sich auch mehr in Deutschland durchsetzt. Super lecker, sehr gesund und geschmacklich auch mal ganz anders, als unsere Salatvarianten.\n\nDas Tom's Urban ist also immer ein guter Anlaufpunkt f\u00fcr einen Drink oder ein Essen. \nDer Service war \u00fcbrigens durchweg sehr freundlich und super aufmerksam. Freies Wlan gibt es vom New York Hotel noch obendrauf. Was will man mehr?! :-)"

            "review": "Perfect spot to recap your vegas night out with your friends. Grab a patio table, order a bloody Mary & enjoy some perfect bar food while reminiscing about last nights events. \n\nLocated at a prime spot street view outside the NYNY its draws you and with its unique entrees you become curious.  Enjoyed an evening dinner here after stumbling upon it while walking around started with a drink. I started with the peach Cosmo which was a bit disappointing because it tasted more like lemon than peach. It wasn't too sweet though so that was a plus. Next the Bellini, not a drink I would ever order again. Its usually made with champagne but they use sparkling white wine. It was way too sweet for me to finish. Lastly the gin and juice was awesome, the muddled strawberries and cucumbers were a great added touch. \n\nThe pork rib sliders served with fried onion rings came out and looked pretty cool. Truffle oil, arugula and mushroom pizza was good! Lots of truffle oil, yummy! Cripsy brussel sprouts. Must try!! \n\nDefinitely recommend sitting on the patio if its not too hot.  I see this place more for a group gathering and catch up spot with friends, not so much a romantic or date night. \n\nService was average at best. A manager stopped by and checked on us but our server was not so easy to locate at time. Nonetheless, the service was average."

Wish we had sat the bar though, service was slow and didn't improve much.\n\nOther than that, the menu was great, a lot of great options. I went with a house margarita, was pretty good. For food I got the Almost Chicago Dog, it was massive. Lots of toppings and the dog was thick and juicy, no homo. Fries were good too, thin style, a tad undercooked, but didn't stop me from eating them. Had a few beers, selection was pretty decent.\n\nI'd recommend stopping in if you're in Vegas for the first time."

There was a wait if you wanted to sit outsides. So we choose to get seated inside and have lunch. Our waiter was very friendly and on his toes. We looked over the menu and placed our order. Everywhere we go we always order appetizers and notice after the fact that it's to much food. Well this time was no different and not knowing that the serving sizes of the meals were so big we ordered appetizers to start the eating extravaganza. \n\nMini Mac & Cheese - Pork green chili carnitas with some Pico de gallo and or course mac & cheese. I do have to say it was just OK. I was expecting and nice and cheesy mac & cheese but it was a little soupy. Not what I expected but it was ok. \n\nThe Sin City - Can anyone ever go wrong with a burger. This burger was huge and had great flavor. 1/2 pound angus beef toped with american cheese, applewood smoked bacon, BBQ sauce, crispy onions and to seal the deal a fried egg. Yes you heard that right, a fried egg. That egg just add's richness to the burger. Cut the burger in half and only ate one half. IT also came with garlic fries and home made ketchup or at least it tasted home made. \n\nBoulder Club - Now this was a big sandwich. It's a triple decker sandwich stuffed with shaved turkey, havarti cheese, slices of avocado, butter lettuce, tomato, mayo and cucumber all on toasted wheat. My wife really enjoyed it and also did not finish the sandwich because of the size and it also comes with a side of garlic fries. \n\nIf you are looking for a nice size meal on the strip stop on by Tom's Urban. You will not be disappointed."

We went to Shake Shack for a quick, casual lunch -- but there was an hour-long line there.\nSince the menu at Tom's Urban looked interesting (and because there was no wait to be seated), we decided to check it out.\nMistake -- BIG mistake.\nIf Tom's Urban was entered into the NCAA Tournament of Bad Service, they would be the Kentucky Wildcats of the restaurant industry.\nTheir servers and managers were a combination of slow, inattentive, ignorant and disinterested.  At one point, we were pretty sure we were the \"before\" crowd of one of those reality TV shows about restaurants on the verge of closing because  of incompetent service.\nBottom line: I will never visit one of their restaurants again...and I learned the lesson that...we should have waited the hour for Shake Shack.\nIn keeping with the basketball theme and quoting Sir Charles: \"turble.\""

We also tried the homemade pop tarts. Flaky crust, loved it! It was my first time, and since breakfast is the one meal I definitely eat I'm always looking for a delicious breakfast. They serve Peet's coffee, and it will wake you up!\n\nNow I normally eat breakfast at Hexx (formerly the Sugar Factory) every time I'm in Vegas. But this place definitely gives them a run for the money. Bonus they have nice patio seating. Perfect for people watchers like myself. \n\nService was good. Everyone was really nice and attentive (I'm big on service, a former server myself! My college jobs). Bad service automatically drops to three stars regardless of the food.\n\nNice decor. \n\nAmbiance! \n\nI definitely will be back. I have to try the Mac and cheese before I leave."

We ate inside on our first visit with a party of 9 and outside on the patio with my mom.  \n\nBoth visits the wait staff were friendly and helpful with making suggestions for this very particular guest!  \n\nEveryone enjoyed their food from the basic burger sliders to the Ruben, pasta dishes and salads.  My chicken pops were seasoned very well, but were DRY - ;-(. \nMy 2nd meal I pieced together and it was yummy!!\n\nThis is a great place for food or just drinks.  You can people watch from the bar or patio as its in an ideal location.  I highly recommend stopping through, especially with guest, as a all around easy spot to get a good in take of the strip!!"

Cocktails were out of this world! I tried the Sin City and the the Tom's Cup and they were both refreshing and sassy enough to have a silly walk back to Caesar's Hotel. The owner, Tom came by and made us feel so welcome. He made some excellent recommendations. The Cheddar Avocado Mashies are sinfully delicious. The staff treated us like movie stars and really knew the menu like the back of their hands! We had such a great time at Tom's that we went back again the next day! Great food, great atmosphere, affordable and family friendly!! Will definitely be back here ASAP and highly recommend it to EVERYONE on the Vegas strip!"

The menu is quite large, and filled with all kinds of treats. We decided to go family style which was advised by our server - Miranda. She was super helpful with the menu, and directed us the right way.  We really loved the vibe of toms!!!  The manager came over to check on us, she even sat and chatted with my wife about the concert.

They have a lot of seating inside as well as some outdoor seating as well. Vegas doesn't have ideal weather much of the year so if they have it, take advantage of it!\n\nI have been to the one in LA and the hometown location of Las Vegas. They both offer the same food and at roughly the same price. During my time here, I ordered a Hangover Slopper which sounded the most appealing with the burger, eggs, fries, and additional deliciousness that followed suit. I also ordered some beers, in which they have a pretty good selection for you to choose from. Our service was good with the occasional person checking up on us to see how our food was and if there was anything else that we needed throughout the night. It can be a bit pricy, so I wouldn't recommend coming here too often, but definitely a nice place you can enjoy one in a while."

Checking out the bars, monitors, modern tables, and the overall roominess of the place made for a great layout.  \n\nOur server was April, and she did an excellent job!  Presented the menus, made a few good suggestions, and followed up with us as we grubbed on our order.\n\nHere's the goods we had:\n~ Colorado Hot Brown: ($21) Slices of turkey and ham sitting on top of a piece of sourdough bread, but imagine it smothered with a pork green chili sauce and tomato.  This is no sandwich mind you!  And finally to add on top, sprinkles of melted pepper jack and cheddar cheese, and applewood-smoked bacon.  Served with you choice of shoestring garlic fries or sweet potato fries.  I chose the yummy crispy garlic shoestring fries.  As for the Hot Brown itself, it wasn't bad at all.  A tad salty.  There was also bit of heat with the nice chili sauce, but overall a great combo of meat.  Almost stew-like.\n\n~ Truffled Maine Lobster Roll: ($22) Maine lobster with a truffled mayo on a butter-toasted brioche roll.  Not bad not bad!  I gotta say it was nice and lobster meaty.  In comparison, I also tried a lobster roll from Phillip's Seafood at Ceasar's.  Now the textures were quite similar, but Tom's roll just beat them out.  It's gotta be the truffle flavor!  If you can't decide, choose this.\n\nNow, I can't say that I totally fell in love with the place, but I can't say I hated it either.  With only an average taste, the prices sorta speak for themselves when browsing through the menu.  IMO, this was a straight 3.5 star experience simply because of the good clean atmosphere and great service, but I'm being generous by rounding up.  \n~ Would I be back to try something different?  Yes.  \n~ Is it worth a try?  Check the menu, and if price isn't your issue, then Yes.  There's a lot of good looking items on that menu."

And second, I'm so glad I did come back.\n\nOn our return visit:\n- 'A' on the cocktails. Perfectly made and tasty. Tip: Get the bacon bourbon bloody mary.\n- 'A' on the service. Michael was a wonderful server. Friendly, helpful, attentive, funny, etc. The complete opposite of our last experience.\n- 'A' on the food. We left full and very pleased with our food decisions.\n\nThe mac 'n' cheese pot was superb. Far better than I even remembered from my very first visit. And the green chile was even better. It was spicier and more flavorful. And the macaroni was perfectly cooked and was full of cheesy goodness. This is one of the best mac 'n' cheese dishes in Vegas. It's officially in my top 5.\n\nThe buffalo wings were great. They're of average size, but very good quality. Cooked well - not too greasy, not too crispy. Excellent sauce coverage. I just wish they were spicier. But the flavors are good and will please those who aren't super spicy fans. (Unfortunately, the ghost pepper sauce was not available as apparently it's not all that popular. Otherwise, we would've been eating those wings.) We opted for both the blue cheese and green chile ranch dipping sauces. Both were excellent. So all needs in my wings were met - quality, sauciness, and good dipping sauces.\n\nThe hangover slopper was huge and delicious. This is the regular slopper, but with a fried egg on top. And a runny egg always makes everything even better. We were actually asked how we wanted our burger cooked this time. And it came out nice and edible. And again, the green chile was even better than before. I practically wanted to lick the plate. It was some seriously delicious green chile. And it's awesomely enjoyed when there's a burger and fried egg involved. This is a tasty dish. And it's definitely big enough to share.\n\nAll in all, we had an excellent return visit. This spot is back on the list of my favs. If you're looking for tasty comfort food with a twist in a laid-back, enjoyable environment, Tom's Urban is a wonderful choice. And if you like mac 'n' cheese, wings, and/or green chile, you've got to come here."

Call me crazy, but I want a light-ish quality dish to bring me back to life.\n\nEven though I come from the Los Angeles area, I have not had the opportunity to snag a bite at this place before so I was excited to give ol' Tom's a go. \n\nPros:\nUpon arriving my guest and I were promptly greeted and seated. We requested to sit outside on the patio despite it being over 100 because of the awesome mist machines they have all over that made it feel like a refreshingly warm day. Not uncomfortable at all.\nI ordered the tree hugger eggs benedict with the side salad and a classic urban mule (waiter warned against frozen). The food was amazing and very well done. The eggs were poached to perfection and there was just the right amount of hollandaise on the dish. The salad complimented the dish very well and was exactly what I was looking for.\nTom's Urban sports a very casual and relaxing vibe after a night of craziness. The staff was very friendly and I had a positive experience overall.\n\nCons:\nHowever, as with most things in life there are a couple things I was not a fan of. After being seated the waiter asked if we would like a bottle of water, as if it was the only option. We said yes to the bottle and were a bit irritated to see that it was $7.00 on the bill. He made no mention of price.\nWe also ordered a homemade poptart to start with (very tasty). Apparently they have different fillings every day and we were not told what the filling of the day was. We ended up liking it, but it is nice to know what you're getting yourself into. In addition, someone else got fresh berries atop theirs, we are not sure if they forgot ours or they requested...the world may never know.\nLastly, although the food was very good it was also very expensive. I would come again, but sparingly due to the price."

We had passed this place while walking through the Las Vegas strip and we figured lets try it. We were so glad we did. We decided to sit outside on one of the high tables. The weather this morning was nice so it was nice to be outside. I was unsure what to order. The breakfast menu was very appealing and appetizing. I chose to order a grapefruit juice and an egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms. Also instead of the home fries I ordered a fresh salad. The food was great. My bf ordered the breakfast burrito and man was that a huge portion. We had a great time. The service was nice. I shall definitely return."

Our favorite was definitely the buffalo chicken sliders.  The filet mignon sliders had to be my least favorite.  I found that the meat was a little tough.  The reason why I gave three stars is because 5 small plates and 2 soda's came out to $80 which seemed a little steep, even by Vegas standards.  I really wanted to try to the taco's but it was 3 taco's for close to $17.  So this is in the middle.  Good food, not so great price"

We ordered fried pickles for an appetizer the big ass egg roll and a sloppy burger for an entree. Problem 1) they didn't bring the fried pickles until they brought the food at the same time.. what's the point of me ordering an appetizer to have it brought with my entree. Problem 2) the food was really average, the fry on the pickle was almost non-existent what was there was soggy the egg roll was overcooked and the sloppy Burger was a big plate that looks like throw up with a burger in the middle. Problem 3) is a bit of a good and bad, the location is nice to sit out on the patio and people watch but if you're sitting along the edge it's also close enough to be accosted by a homeless person asking for food - which we were. The positive was sitting outside during nice weather, drinking beer, and watching an MMA fight...I could probably do that anywhere else and not pay $8.50 a beer. So while I appreciate the management efforts I wouldn't come back here."

Kitchen with less than 20 tables in the restaurant was backed up by an hour. Wait was 30 minutes to sit when clearly there was multiple tables open. After sitting 15 minutes to get drinks. Food came 1 hour later. So all in all was my burger that good? Not exactly. I would say In -N - Out for 75% less than our bill is just as good if not better. \n\nIt could be the fact the were an hour late on food service so they hurried through to make it. But being on the strip with competition of the best restaurants to eat in the casinos I would have expected more."

My friend and I arrived in Vegas pretty late and were looking for a meal, not just a crappy fast-food snack. We trekked from the Luxor to NY NY to find it, and I'm glad we did.  I ordered a choose your own omelet, prepared as scrambled eggs, with spinach, shallots and cheese. It came with cheesy potatoes and toast. The portion was huge, 4 eggs!, but it was tasty.  My friend ordered the Chicago dog, and she enjoyed it too. Our server was friendly, and all in all, a great dinery type place to try."

Everyone enjoyed their food, service was great for us (fast seating, good service, drinks kept coming). I still wish I hadn't had a moscow mule (my fridge is now full of ginger beer and my cabinet full of vodka). \n\nThe highlight for me was definitely the braised short ribs and cheddar polenta. so delicious and satisfying in the way that only something with real fat in it can be. Even thinking about it my mouth is watering. I wish I were in vegas more often so I could go through the rest of the menu. I recommend going with at least three friends so you can all have something different and try each others. Take your time and enjoy their cocktails, they were all great."

We were seated in a nice spot where we were able to enjoy the music and watch the hungovers make their way around vegas.\n\nAt the time we went, around 1030a, the whole menu was available which made it difficult to choose a meal.  She's vegetarian though, so it does help with narrowing our options.\n\nWe decided to share the veggie omelet which came with toast and hashbrowns. And we also ordered the lemon blueberry poppyseed pancakes. Our dishes came fairly quickly and those plates were huge--definitely meant for sharing.\n\nOur omelet was full of veggies and nicely cooked. I especially liked that it wasn't greasy like many omelets can be. The potatoes and toast were also awesome sides.  \n\nI think my friend and I would agree, however, that the star of that meal was the plate of pancakes. Those pancakes were light, very fluffy and very tasty even without the butter or syrup.  At some point, we were just picking at the pancakes!! \n\nSo good. so good."

Regular fries come out instead of sweet potato fries. Burger ordered without cheese came with cheese- so that person did not get served at the same time because they had to redo..

Those duck wings were so tender and juicy, probably the best I've had. All in all, fantastic experience. Thanks everyone at Tom's for giving us a great dining experience and we will definitely be back."

It was during Sunday Football was I was able to catch some games and enjoy my time. The staff was friendly and easily accessible. The prices were affordable ($8-$9 beer) and the food was tasty! I got the burger with sweet potato fries - just what I was craving."

STOP now and find a different place. This place is only open because of their location. We arrived and were seated in a corner.....we waited patiently for about 15 minutes and NO ONE came to our table....finally after waiting I decided to go see if they over looked us...they did! An Asian girl with leopard print sweater approached me and said let me help you!! Great! But alas the server came to the table next to us and had a great conversation for 5 more minutes and walked away! Yes the table sat 10 minutes after us got service!!!  This place is not worth your time money or energy. The food sucks and the service is even worse. Go somewhere else like Back stage Deli open 24 hours!"

I decided to eat out on the patio so that I could enjoy the view and also people after all this \"Vegas\" right!! I had the pleasure of having Jez as my bartender. Not only did she make me the perfect \"spicy\" bloody bourbon Mary she also made some excellent suggestions as to what I should have for lunch. My nephew had the Lobster Mac & Cheese which is \"to die for\" I started to order the same thing but Jez twisted my arm and recommended the jalape\u00f1o bacon burger and OMG the best burger I've had in a while. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection with just the right flavors and just the right kick from the jalape\u00f1os. If your in Vegas I highly recommend you try Toms Urban for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!!"

It was early enough for breakfast but after checking out the menu my wife and I decided on a delicious shrimp, spinach, and avocado salad and filet mignon sliders; not exactly bacon and eggs but the menu is so diverse and fun we were inspired to expand the breakfast horizon. I recommend everything about this restaurant, from the strip-people-watching on the patio, to the helpful and friendly service from the staff, to the quality of the food. It's not really a restaurant that is going to show up on Zagat, but it is high quality, clean, very well done with a successful system for service and quality food. Very relaxed easy vibe and inviting. Go there. You will not be disappointed."

It is Vegas, so expect a higher cost for average food. There are numerous other choices, along the strip. Unless you can't walk any further or are absolutely starving, then go ahead try it out.

Hubby liked his sandwich but didn't care for the juice to dip it in. It was thick like a gravy. I did not care for mine at all. It barely had any pork on it and a excessive amount of mustard that overpowered everything. It also had onions on it that I picked off & didn't say anything. The bartender noticed all the onions on my plate and he offered me a cocktail because they screwed up. I thought that was pretty nice of him. Usually people just pick up your plate and say nothing.

The bread on my sliders was toasted well, and the sauce on the crispy shrimp was great! Their bloody mary selection is good too. I had the Bacon Bourbon Bloody Mary... I mean c'mon, that's not even fair anymore. My hangover was pretty much gone after I finished everything!"

Pages were sticking together as if a sugary drink spilled all over it. The waitress was too quick for me to ask for another menu so I used my husband's. We were seating against a wall in the corner. Which was fine since we don't really mind. My orange juice came in a small glass with two stir straws as if it had alcohol in it. The stir straws,evidently, was also sticky. Interestingly, the chocolate milk was given in a tall glass. My husband got the urban pop tarts. Apple filling. I got the lemon poppy seed blueberry pancakes. It took 25 minutes for us to get our food. My husband's pastry pop tart was about the size of a piece of bread. He took one bite and it was cold. He had to flag the waitress's attention to inform her his food was cold. She took it back and he had to wait a bit longer. We started to eat my pancakes together which was very good. I was pleased with it. Three large pancakes with butter and side of maple syrup. I'm a big fan of lemon poppy seeds so I was happy we enjoyed something there. Shortly later, my husband got his pastry and it was definitely warm this time! I got to try it and it was delicious. It will not be filling if you are very hungry though. \nThey have large round seating which I thought would be great for groups and booths. They do have portable TV stands placed around the restaurant which I like but also made maneuvering around the restaurant a little tricky."

I'm not normally a Brussels sprouts fan so I was wary when they were recommended.  Glad I choose to get them they were awesome. Next I had a chicken burrito. It was very good, just flat out a good burrito.  For dessert I had three things with my group. We had the cheesecake, excellent crust and a good taste throughout, also the pineapple upside down cake was very good as well.  Finally on a hunch I order pop tarts which are not on the dessert menu.  All I can say is that you have to try them, very unique and very good.  Overall a great experience, I will be back!!!"

We were seated by a friendly host at a table on the patio (which is literally connected to the Brooklyn Bridge) and greeted almost immediately by our awesome server Nathan! We tried both of his recommendations and both were equally delicious. I had the filet mignon steak sliders, which had hollandaise sauce on top that really accented the very tender steak. My husband had the sin city burger and said it could easily be the best burger he's ever had. Smothered in BBQ sauce, topped with crispy onions, bacon, and fried egg. His burger came with sweet potato fries, with an amazing chipotle cinnamon rub and some kind of Jamaican jerk ketchup. Definitely not use to finding such great service on the strip with such great food to come with it. We will definitely be back and will be requesting Nathan again!!"

This is my new spot to drop in for amazingly filling foods. I came in with a group of hungry girlfriends, and we left stuffed and ready to lay by the pool. We started off with bellinis that were absolutely perfect to hydrate from the Vegas heat. For food starters we got a bunch of the small plates to share, and the duck wings were amazing! If you are unsure of duck you have to try them. The sauce is a perfect sticky stick to the duck sauce, and you have to eat the slaw with it. Absolutely yum! Brussels sprouts, fried pickles, and spicy edamame were equally as amazing. I highly recommend the fried pickles because they are the ones you want and expect- perfect crispness and not dry at all. Okay being 7 girls ready to eat we ate, but we couldn't conquer because the portions are absolutely huge! I had the lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese.... To Die For!!! It's baked, comes out in a skillet, and each bite will have seafood all the way till the end. One of the girls had the Hangover Slop, she said it's a must and didn't want to stop. I saw one of the girls having the eggs benedict and I was blown away at how huge the English muffins were. They could hold up to the thicker slices of ham on top! \nThank you Erron, Lina, and Carmen for the amazing customer service. You guys had the best recommendations. Lina was the sweetest for constantly refilling my water. It's so hot in Vegas and needed to rehydrate. Erron was our manager who came out to see how we were. Thank you being so kind and your awesome vibes. \nOh P.S. the homemade poptarts are a freaking must!!!!! \nComing back tomorrow... Or dinner..."

We tried to call ahead for a table but they weren't taking any reservations.  Think it was because of St Patricks Day and March Madness.  No biggie though.  We grabbed shots and beers at the bar while we waited for a table since there was 6 of us.  Great beer selection and cool patio which was packed.\n\nSo, not really sure if it's a sports bar but there's lots of TVs and the host set us up with a great spot where we could see multiple games all at once which was cool.  Big food menu with lots to choose from.  Pretty awesome they serve breakfast all day.  I got the steak & eggs and lemon poppyseed blueberry pancakes.   Both were on point and the portions were huge.  Way too much food!  Other guys got burgers, pork belly tacos, buffalo wings, steak and fries .  Gotta try the sin city burger next time.  It had a fried egg, fried onions, cheddar cheese and bacon.  Looked delicious and my buddy said he loved it.  \n\nFor how busy they were, service was good too.  Our server Zooey was super cool.  2 of the steak dishes were over cooked so we had to send back.  She was very accommodating.  Of course they were too rare the 2nd time.  We're a fairly high maintenance crew though.  And I was good because my steak was cooked perfect.  Lol.  A manager did come by to apologize since they weren't to our liking even on the 2nd try.  He ended up bringing us a couple pop tarts (yeah, they have pop tarts!), a Fireball milkshake, a caramel Kraken milkshake and he took the steaks off our bill.  Pretty cool.  I've never had a milkshake with liquor in it.  Yummy stuff \n\nAside from the steak incident, everything was really good.  Interesting food with lots to choose from.  Cool vibe.  Good service.

Our waiter came and my sister and I were deciding what to get in our omelet and apparently 5 seconds was longer than he wanted to wait because he just left.  He eventually came back and we ordered. My sister and I were going to share an omelet and sweet potato fries.  My son ordered the cheeseburger  with garlic fries and my mom ordered a coke and also sweet potato fries.  The waiter wrote this down and left.  We waited over 25 minutes for our food and when it came my son had sweet potato fries instead of garlic and they forgot mine.  We told the guy who brought the food and he said no problem he will take care of it.  We also asked him for an extra plate being that we were sharing.  We never saw this guy again.  He obviously had no intention of helping nor did he relay the message to our waiter.  So we had to track our waiter down and tell him the problem and asked for a plate.  Well, it took 2 more times and  over 10 minutes to get that plate.  Then our waiter brought my son his garlic fries and we told him we still had not received our sweet potato fries.  He gave us attitude then came back with more garlic fries. Seriously WTF.  We were so annoyed.  He finally got it right, but not without making sure we knew he was annoyed, but its not our fault he got the order wrong in the first place grr.  My mom never got her coke either he totally forgot.  The food was ok, our toast was cold when it arrived. I also forgot to mention my son wanted a milk shake, but he said the machine was broken and suggested we go next store to Shake Shack,  C'mon really--get it together  We really wanted this meal to be good seeing as it was our last one of our trip, but it was a disaster.  This waiter had no social skills and really sucked at his job.  \n\nOn a positive note, my son said his food was good and the sweet potato fries were yummy.  Plus, the location is nice.  However, I would never go back after the experience we had."

The filet mignon was so tender that it literally broke apart as you bit into the slider.  The butter-toasted brioche buns and the unique hollandaise sauce enhanced the flavor of this dish.  YOU HAVE TO GET THE FRENCH FRIES TWO WAYS because you need to try both of the fries they offer here.  They are so different, yet equally delectable.  It also comes with two different kinds of ketchup (Moroccan and Caribbean) that compliment their respective fries perfectly.\n\nMy friends tried the Big Ass Egg Roll and the Steak Burrito.  Both of them were pretty good.  The Big Ass Egg Roll is basically a huge deep fried burrito, which would get tiring to eat after awhile unless you love fried foods.\n\nI had two cocktails: the Ultimate Peach Cosmo and the Skyy High Roller. The Ultimat Peach Cosmo is a little sweet, but was still delicious.  I loved both of them and would recommend them.\n\nThe service could use a bit of work, but I think it is just because they recently opened and are still working on the kinks.  I would definitely return here again, especially to try out the outdoor patio bar area when the weather gets warmer!"

It's the perfect small plate that will fill your belly and put the right amount of spice on your tongue. \n\nPair it with a side order of sweet potato fries and you have the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.

Most of the other places focus on a type of cuisine (other than America, which is very basic American comfort food) but Tom's take on everything is unique. Our first meal was lunch. We both had burgers, mine being the portobello swiss with truffle mayo. It was absolutely delicious. My next meal was for dinner-- appetizer of queso fundito (enjoyed it.. might have been good with some crispy tortilla chips to go along with the flour tortillas, just to mix it up a bit).. my friend and I each got sliders, her the BBQ chicken and me the shrimp po' boy. Our affable server Mike admitted that the shrimp sliders were not really like authentic southern po' boys (he's from Texas, and he knows things like that) but that was ok with me, I've never been there and wouldn't know the difference. The shrimp were HUGE and succulent and the slaw inside was tasty and added a nice crunch. I tasted the chicken slider and that too was delish-- the BBQ sauce was on point. They were sadly out of the pineapple upside down cake which he graciously apologized for and ended up discounting our meal a bit, since we were really looking forward to trying it and it's something that is rarely on restaurant menus. Next time for sure! Finally our last meal of our trip was hey, back at TU and my friend had lovely fluffy and aromatic lemon poppyseed pancakes and I had the treehugger benedict (egg, avocado, hollandaise with bacon).. so delicious. Avocado should be standard on all eggs benedicts all over the planet. The hash browns had cheese in them and they were perfectly crisp and salty delicious. I had asked for grits because Mike had said they were authentic and yummy, and I agreed. My first time tasting grits and I enjoyed them. All in all, three delicious meals and the staff was attentive and friendly every time. Very rare in restaurant dining. We'll be back for sure again and again!"

The bar is large and there is a lot of indoor and outdoor seating.\n\nThe food was tasty and we had a good time. The issue was with the time it took to get food. I am patient when a place is busy, but this was far past acceptable. Our bartender and the manager were both attentive and took care of us while we waited. That is why they get three stars instead of one or two.\n\nThe first thing I tried was the Asadero Hash Brown. They are great. The textures and flavors are spot on. These are a very good side for any meal.\n\nNext up were the Buffalo Chicken Sliders. These are exactly like they sound. No need for further description. The buns, meat and sauce are good. These  are a nice appetizer.\n\nThe last thing I tried was the Sticky Belly Steamed Buns. These are steamed buns filled with pork belly, Asian peanut slaw and green onion. They normally come with cilantro as well, but I hate cilantro so requested them without it.\n\nIf they can get the kitchen figured out we will certainly visit regularly during our Las Vegas visits."

Of course, the beer was a little pricier than I am used to, but it was nice to drink something other than domestic bottles from the casino floor. I appreciated that they had a printed beer list that appeared to be up to date. \n\nI ordered some steak nachos that were not that great. I mostly ate only the chips that had cheese baked on them, and left the other trimmings on the plate. The order is definitely large enough for 4 people to share as a hearty appetizer.\n\nMy server / bartender seemed like a really cool, chill person, but unfortunately I didn't get great service.

Was excited to try the duck wings as I've had them other places before. The sauce was overpowering and you couldn't taste the actual wings. I ordered the Cleveland hot brown which was a pile of soggy meat covered in cheese. I don't know what the flavor was supposed to be but it was not to my taste. The garlic fries on the side tasted like eating a pure garlic clove. Gave this place 2 stars because the service was quick and our server felt bad I didn't like my food so she took it off the bill."

The Vietnamese plum sauce on the salmon was so good. The sugar in the sauce was caramelized from the cooking process.  \n\nThe outdoors space is urban and bright. The seats have funky bright colors that gives the space a fun vibe. The space is airy and open. The open outdoor space has an overhead of showering water heads.

            "review": "Man, good reviews and the place looked nice but what a disappointment. \n\nFirst the place was basically empty and yet they had a 20 min wait. No problem, I know how that works, I worked in a restaurant for years. Understaffed on a Sunday morning NBD. Then we get seated at the bar, cool we're in Vegas and I'm gonna want an Irish coffee, sounds great to me! The bar tender has the whole area to himself but there weren't that many people there so I figured it shouldn't be too bad but I guess I was wrong. \n\nWe ordered two waters and two Irish coffees. He forgot the waters but serves the Irish coffees. I try to get his attention but it was near impossible. Maybe this guy was new? I'm not sure but he took forever to do everything. It was taking about 10 minutes to get his attention and I really needed some water before diving into my Irish coffee since I had a slight headache (probably from being dehydrated) so I leave the bar and walk to the deli to buy a bottle of water. \n\nThen it took at least another 10 minutes to get our order taken and he was putting the order in right in front of us as we were telling him our order. After 35 minutes of waiting for our food we realized it's probably not a back up in the kitchen that's taking it so long... so we ask the bar tender (again, took forever to get his attention) to check on our food. He comes back and doesn't even say anything to us first but looks in the computer. Ya know... I was a server before, I know the \"oh shit I didn't put it in\" look and that's ok, that stuff happens. But that only happened when I was hammered with too many tables which this guy did not have. \n\nBy this point I was done with this bartender whom I had so much patience with up until that point. While waiting for our food another table had sat down and was ignored so long that they got up and left. Another table also sat down and while the bartender started to put their order into the computer they left too. It was just so bizarre that he didn't have that many tables and he didn't have that many drink orders to make for the rest of the restaurant yet everything was taking forever and he didn't seem to be in a rush at all. His demeanor was very sluggish for a bartender. \n\nAnyway after looking in the computer he looks up at us and says \"I don't know what happened but the kitchen doesn't have the ticket, can you tell me your order again.\" So either he forgot to press \"send order\" or the kitchen dropped the ticket somewhere. Either way, at that point of waiting approximately 40 minutes for food the manager needs to get involved and something should be given up, free app or like 10% off the bill. Doesn't matter what it is as long as SOMETHING is given. This guy doesn't even think to ask and that's when I realized he's just naturally bad at this job. \n\nI would have asked for a manager but we were so hungry that we were fed up and didn't want to wait any longer. I asked for the bill and for two Irish coffee's it was $22. WHAT A RIP OFF. \n\nWe went to a crepe place right across from them and had food within 3 minutes and it was DELICIOUS. \n\nThe next time we're in Vegas I think we'll try this place again, but we definitely won't sit at the bar. I hate to judge a place after only one visit, and we didn't even try the food, so we'll be back. Hopefully the second time will be much better!"

The patio space is great! They have heaters (we were there in Jan) and you can people watch, I don't know why one would sit inside. That day, something must have been completely off with the kitchen staff, our order of two omelets took almost an hour to come and when it did arrive, they got our omelet wrong. The strudel we got came quickly though. The food, once it arrived was good. But just the amount of time it took for the food to arrive was crazy. That said, our waitress was super apologetic about the whole situation. She pretty much apologized to the point where I started feeling bad for her. Also, our full meal was on the house, so I'm not going to sit here and complain. I think they realized they made a mistake and made up for it the best way they could."

Sever removed one meal (the only one we commented on) from the bill and also poured a couple to go mimosas for the bottomless mimosas.  The Food:  Worst hash browns I have encountered.  They were undoubtedly reconstituted hash browns from a box or bag.  Many if not most breakfast joints serve these prefab potatoes and sometimes they can be decent, these were not!  I think this may be why they come with a slice of cheese melted on top, an attempt to cover the sin of botching these so badly.  The Huevos Benedicto was ok if it weren't for being cold.  It was removed from our bill.  Gigante Breakfast Cubano was the best thing we ordered, nicely grilled sourdough with a lot of ham, cheese, carnitas (I assume roasted pork shoulder), a couple eggs, pickles and mustard also the hash browns, which covered in swiss cheese and eggs and layered between the meats didn't stand out as much as when they were dried out on the side of a plate."

It was pull away consistency and melted away happily in my mouth. Another high point was the house made BBQ sauce. It coated the ribs quite well and it was a perfect mix of sweet and savory. I am not a eat ribs out in public type of guy by any means, but I would lift the \"ban\" for another rack of these!\n\nThis time I tried to save room for dessert and since we received it complimentary, the campfire brownie + cookie + s'mores cried out to us. One rule of thumb: DON'T EAT IT RIGHT AWAY! I badly burnt the top of my mouth for a good week and a half so use caution. I will say the portion is massive as you can see in the pictures, but it's a guilty pleasure for sure! The marshmallow is toasted to camp ground consistency and the brownie was soft as cotton. Just like the menu says it's a foodgasm for sure!\n\nBeyond the ability to now find a go-to meal I have to acknowledge the service from the servers and even the manager. We had amazing staff and it just felt like we knew them forever by the end of the meal. They were 100% genuine and we made sure to reward them through the bill and we even called to recognize them to the NYNY hotel staff as well. A+ on all fronts to all involved in our outing!\n\nI do have an upcoming Vegas outing coming up and you bet I will be back yet again and again!"

We ordered the lobster mac n cheese and the butter poached lobster & shrimp tacos and they were deliciously cheesy and refreshing, respectively. We washed them down with a 33oz beer and frozen margarita, which were good values (& the margarita was on happy hour special!). Michael was funny and efficient. The outdoor patio area was nice for people watching and our hostess greeted us much faster outside, as the one inside disappeared and left 7 people at the stand who all walked away. Great food and service: We will definitely be back!"

Instead of going to a crowded bar to watch, we went here as it was not crowded. Now, I understand why it was not crowded. I was not very impressed with their choice of food but drinks and service were good. The waiter seemed discouraging on questions about their dishes. The prices for appetizers were a little too much if you ask me. We wanted to spend money on apps since we would stay to watch the game but that didn't happen.. \n\nThe Colorado Calamari we ordered was small and super salty. I didn't like the breading they used or the sauce. I basically ate most of the jalape\u00f1os in the dish. We also ordered Buffalo wings. Very little for what we paid. The wings were pretty decent but it was just coated well with the buffalo sauce. Again, it had the same sauce as the Colorado Calamari that I didn't like. We didn't want to try anymore as after those two apps, it might be the same. We had their drinks. I ordered the 32oz souvenir cup with their Sin City Punch. The drink was ok. After awhile the coconut milk was separating and started to taste weird. I liked the souvenir cup but it was plastic and I paid $32 for this? I am not sure I would go back here. I can tell the food is not all that especially for the bill we got at the end. The service was the best part and able to watch the game. Go Warrior's!! =)"

A few people in my group ordered the bottomless mimosa and our server only came over once in the hour we had been there. When asked for a refill, our server told us they are no longer serving the bottomless mimosa. This is ridiculous. We paid $20 each for the mimosa and were ignore. It also too over an hour to get our food. After waiting for our food, I was told they forgot to order my food. It took another 40 mins to get my order. Not to mention that we had 3 people who come down late and had ordered 5 mins after the rest of the group and it too there food 30 mins longer to come than the rest of the table. When our food did arrive, it was cold, as if it had been sitting in the window for awhile. When all 11 of us agreed we had a bad experience, I know they restaurant did something wrong.  The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star was because the manager, Tim, did everything he could to make things right. The food also tasted good, albeit, cold. Ultimately, the damage had been done, but for the 2+ hours of miserable service, it was a relief to have Tim comp our meal. At least we left with a less of a sour taste in our mouth. I would love to recommend this place to friends and family, but after this experience, I just can't do that."

With its aqua and persimmon-colored orb lighting dotting the ceiling coupled with its wooden rustic paneling, it looks straight out of something from Austin, TX...I dig it. \n\nFor $18, you get bottomless mimosas, provided you get there somewhat early (the cut-off time for this deal is 1pm) I had the Classic Eggs Benedict ($13) and my friend got the Lemon Poppyseed Blueberry pancakes ($10). We split our entrees and had a good combo of savory and sweet. I have to say the pancakes were amazing! My eggs benedict looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp for longer than expected (see picture), but it was still good.\n\nOur waitress was friendly. It took awhile for the first set of mimosas to come out, but after that, they seem to keep coming. By the time we paid the check, we were both nursing bad champagne headaches. Actually, the menu states they use sparkling wine, so I'm not sure if that contributed to the intensity. Nonetheless, we got what we came for! Overall, breakfast prices are decent, but I agree with other reviewers that their other foods run a little high."

The place was relatively empty for a Friday evening so I was a little worried that there was a problem. We sat at the main bar and were immediately greeted by Danni who was very friendly, upbeat and professional.  Bar service was excellent.  Dani got our drinks right away and checked back with us regularly to see if we were ready for another round or needed anything else. We ended up ordering some appetizers (duck wings and sliders).  The one thing that has not changed about this pace is the inordinate amount of time it takes to get food from the kitchen to the table. I didn't time it but the place was 75% empty and it must have taken 20-30 minutes to get two appetizers.  When the food finally did arrive it was hot and fresh and very good so no problems with quality.  I ended up telling Dani about the last review I did and told her how much we appreciated the professional service we were receiving from her.  Dani let us know that she was the bar manager, which we were both glad to hear since that will hopefully influence the overall performance of the staff at the bar.  There was another bartender on that night (Stephanie?) who was also very friendly and professional so it looks like Dani is managing her team well.  Dani also bought us a round of drinks which was a very classy thing to do. It was definitely a better experience this time than we had in January but if it were not for Dani I would on the fence because of the slooow food service. At this point, I'd say it was overall a good experience."

I feel like I can't give a full review as we only came for breakfast and had the basics (eggs, bacon and hash browns). The music was good and uplifting (especially after a long night in Vegas). \n\nProbably would have given them 4 stars had the waiters been a little nicer and faster. We didn't have much contact with the 2-3 waiters who helped up. The food took quite some time to come out. We both had the simplest of breakfasts and it didn't seem that busy.\n\nMaybe it was just a one time flook. I loved the ambiance and the food was good so I'd probably give it another shot and even recommend to try it,"

Skip this place and go to another restaurant right next door on the Strip. So sad because the patio has a great view of the strip but the food is pathetically pricey and unoriginal especially given what it is. Sadly, I have a gluten allergy and when I asked about their options, I had two choices. I opted for the grilled salmon mango salad and when they brought it to the table, I got a bland piece of salmon served with white leaf cabbage and cucumbers. That's it. Where's my mango? Clearly no flavor of any kind. So I asked if I could have some GF dressing plus a few spinach leaves & tomatoes. No dressing choices for me and they charged $2 for a super tiny portion of spinach. Just awful. If you're into deep fried, buttered, super salty, bland food drenched in sauce then maybe this place will strike your fancy. But in Vegas, come on.... You have to do better than that. Up your game and add some creative options so that others can enjoy tasty food too. Discover flavor in the kitchen and add some creativity to your food. Only way to survive in Vegas."

It's immediately apparent a lot of thought and money has gone into designing a space that's comfortable and fun. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable about the foods on their menu.\n\nWe ordered the Crispy Duck Wings, Ginger Chicken Pot Stickers, \"Sticky\" Belly Steamed Buns and the Carnitas Cuban Sandwich. Although on the pricey side, their food is definitely flavorful. We really enjoyed all of the dishes. Only the duck wings gave us a slight pause. The wings were good, but I would have liked to have been able to taste the duck a little bit more. The sauce was somewhat overpowering. But overall, an excellent culinary experience."

Not crowded - we were there on a Wednesday afternoon. There was a nice mix of music selections from various decades with cool videos as accompaniment. I like the open floor plan and decor. \n\nThe food was just okay. It was kind of non-descript and lacked flavor. I've been to farm to table restaurants that seemed to use seasoning that enhanced the natural freshness. The best item, to me, was the garlic french fries - which weren't all that garlic-y, in my opinion.\n\nI'm glad I tried this place but I probably will not return. While the service and environment were enjoyable, I'm a foodie so I expect more in that area."

Was cooked to a perfect medium rare as I requested, bun was soft yet held it's integrity, Swiss was melted to perfection and the truffle didn't overwhelm it. The garlic fries were also flavorful, a little on the oily side but I like them like that.\n\nFilet Mignon & Eggs: Tender steak, hashbrows had a perfect crust on them with light heat, and the blackberry jam paired perfectly with the sourdough. \n\nTom's Cup in Tom's Size (basically double sized): Beefeater gin, strawberry, cucumbers, mint and lime.

The menu is quite extensive and an interesting twist on various street foods.  The location is good with entrances from the strip and from inside the hotel. The server was friendly and engaging. \n\nThe bad - the prices!  Especially on the cocktails.  $22.50 each. And the Long Island Iced Tea was horrible. Truly awful, mainly lemonade not sour mix.  The food was just okay.  I expected more flavor, more spice; it was all a bit bland. \n\nThe crazy annoying - it was very warm, so we asked about the A/C and the manager came over and said it was under the control of the hotel and there was nothing he could do. Well, calling engineering is something. Then while serving the entrees, same manager fumbled two entrees and they crashed to the floor. \n\nThe total failure - the staff said the could not split the check more than the two tables we were sitting at, not by couples.  Then when the checks were presented everything was mixed up. Drinks from Table A on Table B, appetizers from B on A.  And it took them 40 minutes to correct it. Forty minutes!\n\nFinal thought - it's an interesting concept that could be executed better. The staff's attitude is one of indifference since they cater to tourists and locals will avoid."

I had carnitas burrito. Pretty visually but mainly filled with rice and rolled too skinny do all you taste is tortilla. \n\nVery clean open space. Similar to the one at LA Live. \n\nOverall, a nice addition to the food landscape at NYNY."

We checked out the menu it was really awesome good variety and we could sit on the patio which was right on the strip! The sweet potato fries and eggs were good milkshakes were also good but on the pricy side. The part that sucked was the wait and miscommunication among servers. We had a total of 3 servers. One apparently was cut and left without letting us know or anyone else I guess as we had to ask someone for our bill after a good half hour of watching server after server walk by us. It's to bad we would have loved to go back but it wasn't worth it when there are so many great restaurants with servers that go out of their way to help you.\n\nUpdate\nEven though our experience in the restaurant was poor I appreciate that Mr.Winter contacted me personally via email and addressed my concerns. My husband and I will give Tom's Urban another go and hopefully we can really enjoy our experience, after all it is a pretty trendy little restaurant with a great location!"

Everybody deserves one, and we really want to like it. It's nice to see a new restaurant with Strip view in the neigbourhood of our hotel (The Signature).\n\nWe made reservations without any special request. Upon arrival (7PM) it was not very busy so we had a choice of tables: inside, at the bar or on the patio overlooking The Strip. No hard choice. Overlooking The Strip. For our standards it was a very nice evening to sit outside. And we're glad that since our first visit about 10 years ago the're much more terraces. Maybe not for July/August, but perfect in spring and autumn. Tom's Urban and the surrounding area are a big improvement.\n\nElizabeth made us feel right at home with some good suggestions on the eating and drinking menu. Also giving our visit a personal touch by telling us something about her passion (travelling) and here home state. Which we visited on a prior trip to the USA.\n\nWe ordered Duck Wings and Ginger Pot Stickers as an appetizer and The Chicken and NYNY Steak as entrees. With garlic fries on the Side. \n\nThe appetizers we're really nice. And if you order them: don't skip the salad under the Duck Wings. It's great! Not just decoration ;). And I even think we like Duck Wings more than the more obvious chicken.\n\nService was quick, friendly and genuine interested. The food was all sizzling hot upon arrival. The only thing you can say about the entrees is that the're no lady sizes. Pfff...I really digged in, but by the time I exploded I wasn't even halfway the plate.......We declined on the boxing offer. I know you've paid for it so it's yours, but we think it's not giving credits to the cook. Reheated is always less attractive and that will be your last experience, not the better earlier memory.\n\nBiggest thing we regreted was that there was no room for dessert. And we really looked forward to the Cheesecake. Well, a good reason to return in September.\n\nAll together we had a great evening. Due to the nice food and drinks (try the pineapple cider!) and definitly because of Elizabeth. And looking around us we're not the only ones having a great evening. A lot of smiling faces around us. From staff members and guests.\n\nWe'll be back.\n\n(Excuse any grammar or typing mistakes. I'm no native speaker)."

Her manager was a bit lackluster but tried to totally redeem himself by saying corporate is really into Yelp. Is this supposed to help??? Anywho, food, drinks and Maggie were awesome."

We arrived, entered through the street-side door, and waited at the hostess booth no one ever came so we went to the bar to ask about seating. \n\nFinally the hostess came to seat us, walked us thru the dining room which was full of dirty tables. So she brought us out to the 'lounge' side, but told us if we eat out there, we would have to walk up to the bar to place our orders - no waitress. So we waited while they bused a table for us. We sat. \n\nThe menu had an excessive amount of items on it. It seemed all over the place. It would have been easier to choose with a more simplistic menu. \n\nThe restaurant was surprisingly dirty for a newer restaurant. There was food dried to our table. Food scraps all over the carpeted floor (which seemed odd to have in a pub style restaurant). And the fabric seats had dried food on the backs of them. It was really gross. \n\nI ordered the honey BBQ chicken sliders. Despite not being overly busy, they took about 20 minutes to come out. They were just battered pieces of chicken seemingly without seasoning, and coated in what tasted like bland jarred BBQ sauce. It was honestly so bad, I didn't eat more than half of one slider. \n\nThe waiter asked if I wanted something else but honestly, I didn't want to wait. (Note - the restaurant didn't offer to compensate the meal.)\n\nOverall the restaurant environment was very low class, and grossly misrepresented in the hotel ad. \n\nI would not recommend this restaurant."

I wasn't very hungry so just ordered the appetizer of Brussel sprouts and surprised me with how tasty they were! my husband got the 'big ass egg roll' which was basically a fried burrito. We were pretty disappointed with it. We did have to wait a long time for these two items to be served, which wasn't really a big deal to us as we were just enjoying each others company but the waitress brought out two pork belly tacos, compliments if the chef, to apologize for the wait. We were pleasantly surprised! My husband said they were better than the meal he had ordered. overall, not a bad dining experience, but not a particularly memorable or outstanding one either."

After 45 minutes the waitress came back and said our ticket was \"almost up\". At this point it was after 11:30 and the tables around us surprisingly enough were getting their orders. At this point I requested to speak to a manager and he immediately came up and apologized and stated he would take a discount from our check. 15 minutes later our food arrived, but from the 3 orders, all of them were cold. When finished the waitress informed us that our check had been taken care of by the manager. Also, while we were eating the table that was seated next to us that came in about 35 minutes after had a big fluffy omelette delivered. Needless to say we appreciated the waived bill and left.

My boyfriend and I got tired of gambling and wanted to have a late night snack (if you call it a snack) but didn't feel like fast food. We are done walking and after a few beers/drinks at the slot machines there's no way we are driving anywhere. I know it's Vegas baby but still after all day walking from one casino to the next I'm pooped! We stumbled upon this spot coz it seems like they're still serving food and yup we were in luck coz they were! We were so happy we didn't even care to look at the menu before going in (we had no idea what kind of food they served) I thought for a second that it was a mexican restaurant coz of the hot sauce on the tables but the siracha threw me off though! Could it be Chinese? Ahhhh so the friendly hostess sat us and gave us the menu. They have burgers, tacos, sandwiches, breakfast items from pancakes to omelette and shakes as well (with alcohol may I add). So it's not Chinese after all hahaha. I ordered the filet mignon steak with eggs and toast. My boyfriend ordered the portobello mushroom swiss burger and garlic fries. And I did try to order a chocolate shake but their shake machine has not arrived yet (that's how new this place is) no biggie I can live without the shake. The food was great! My steak was cooked medium rare as I requested and melted in my mouth. My boyfriends burger was cooked medium and he ate it in less than 10 minutes. He said its one of the best burgers he had. He's a burger lover so I'll take his word for it. Over all the foods great, the service was great and we will definitely come back to eat here again when we come back to Sin City!"

            "review": "I like to go here for lunch.  This is nicely located on the strip at New York New York facing MGM Grand right next to Shake Shack.  \n\nThe atmosphere is trendy/rustic.  TVs everywhere playing sports or music videos.  A popular place to be on a Friday.\n\nThe tables and booths along the wall are nice, but the booths in the middle of the floor were kind of strange.  It's circular shaped, and will probably only fit 6 people at the most.  Just my opinion, not used to these style of booths.  \n\nFavorites: Lobster Mac & Cheese and the spicy XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken.  \n\nSpicy XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken: fried chicken strips on another level!  super spicy and filled with dry rub spices.  Comes with parmesan garlic shoe string fries.  Super large portion that is shareable with 2 people.\n\nLobster Mac & Cheese:  Comes with portions or lobster and shrimp on a hot metal dish.  They are pretty generous with their seafood portions on their mac & cheese.  \n\nNot so favorite: steak in chimichurri sauce.  The steak was not tender at all, and a pain in the ass to cut.  There were very few pieces of the steak that was not chewy and somewhat good to eat, but it was tough for the most part.  \n\nPrice: It's on the strip, so you may somewhat pay \"strip\" prices, but it's not too bad.  Cheaper than most places on the strip."

We were seated immediately when our server was promptly over.  He was very attentive and friendly.  It was also nice of the manager to stop by our table to check on our experience. Great service! \n\nSince I loved it so much the first time, we ordered the Prime Rib Philly Cheesesteak Dip.  This comes with your choice of sweet potato fries or garlic fries.  This sandwich did not disappoint.  Mounds of shaved prime rib were piled high with melted havarti cheese on a brioche roll.  Yum.  Although we also ordered the Hot One Pizza, the sandwich would have been more than enough.  The shoestring garlic fries on the side had a great flavor although very greasy.  The hot one pizza is good with all of the spicy toppings they include - spicy giardiniera, jalape\u00f1os, spicy pepperoni and spicy oil.  Just make sure you have some water nearby.  \n\nWe wouldn't hesitate stopping back in again.  Great location in NY NY with a great menu!"

Almost 10 minutes before a waiter came over to even greet us - then all down hill from there. \n\nA buddy and myself just wanted some quality people watching with a bit of good food and drink- the people watching was ok. The food, drink and service were an average of less than mediocre, at best. The server had little clue about the menu and even denied having items that were on the menu when asked about them.  Lol it was so bad! \n\nInitially, when we still assumed we might trust the person serving us ... we were directed to order a drink called \"Toms Cup\". This is how found that trusting that the waiter was a bad idea. The drink was gross. Imbalanced and overly sweet - it was just unappealing. Not his fault - but seeing as they were full when we finished the meal - it would have been appropriate for him to ask why they were two nearly full drinks. \n\nWe also ordered and fig and cheese sandwich which was the best thing we had - it was served with garlic fries that were almost sufficient. The pot stickers were bland, under cooked and overall boring. Please don't get them.\n\nNeither of us could bring ourselves to complain because we were both in the service industry, and this was honestly just terrible - to an extent that we just wanted to leave and forget about it. \n\nTo top it all off - we were still trying to eat some of the food - mainly the garlic fries that were one of the most edible things - but I also asked for the bill so we could go. The waiter brought over the bill and began to stack the food plates - (THAT WE  WERE  STILL EATING OFF OF) - on top of one another, with food still on them.. Literally while we were both still chewing. \n\nI said \"hey man\" we were still eating that. He said \"oh\" and proceeded to unstack the plates and give me the fries that were smashed underneath the other plates. I just looked at him. The guy truly was clueless. \n\nSo it was over $50 for two unfinished drinks, terrible pot stickers and a descent fig and cheese sandwich. I will never make this mistake again. There is no excuse for bad service and mediocre food - especially at this price point. It's not going to break the bank - but it's just a waste of everyone's time and money. \n\nHappy eating to you!"

A huge portion too which made it easy to share and worth the $22 it cost. Lots of lobster and shrimp. \nThe mash potatoes were also good and avocado adds and extra creaminess too it. That with the Mac was a little to much cheese for me and I love cheese. \nGood did take a little long to make it out and the place was not overly busy.

I was stuck with either having the sun in my face or sitting in the chilly shade, but I also could've just worn warmer clothing.  The people watching outside New York New York was a nice way to pass the time.\n\nI ordered the urban breakfast platter.  My sunny side up eggs were cooked well, though the bacon was quite oily and chewy.  The sourdough toast was a little light on the butter but had a great chew.  The standouts were the amazing asadero hash browns and the little cup of preserves for the toast.  I would definitely go back for the cheesy goodness of those potatoes, and the sweetness of the preserves was a perfect compliment to the salty toast, especially after it had been dipped in egg yolk.\n\nIt's probably partially because I was seated on the patio when it was very windy and chilly in the shade, but my only real complaint is that the temperature of my food was off.  The cheese was solidified on the hash browns, the toast has hardened into sharp rock-hard shards, and the bacon was not crispy.  Perhaps my food was waiting at the pass longer than it should have been?\n\nService was otherwise great, my water stayed filled, and my request for a new ketchup bottle was taken care of promptly.  I feel their prices are very reasonable considering their location, especially when compared to the prices many of the casino's cafes are charging."

The inside dining area has round booths that can probably accomodate about 8 people. Service was fast and friendly and we got our drink order pretty quickly. \n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon Steak & Eggs. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium-rare), and had a delicious, melt-in-your-mouth consistency. Unfortunately, that was the only part of the meal that I liked. I specified over-medium for the eggs, but they came out looking fried - no chance of getting any runny yoke here. The hash browns were a bit tough. As though it were cooked by three different people. Too bad. Those things ruined an otherwise tasty dish.\n\nMy girl had the Truffled Maine Lobster Roll, which is basically a lobster sandwich. The sandwich was good - lobster tasted fresh. It would have would have been nice if they included a lemon wedge with it, so that you can squeeze it over the lobster. Also, toasting the outside would have given the texture of the sandwich a little more contrast. I didn't see if that option was on the menu, but I would ask for this if I were to order this sandwich again.\n\nOverall, this experience was kind of meh, but I'd be willing to give this place another shot - maybe."

The buns were of good quality, well made.\n6. Filet Mignon Sliders. (2). Tasty, tender meat, brioche bun, an asian peanut slaw with cilantro, and onion. \n7.

Crunchy, sweet & tangy! They are on the pricey side @ $14 for 4 & I am not a huge fan of the mound of raw cabbage they laid on. The flavors were amazing. This owns a star rating in itself. \n\nThe portobello burger was meh. The cheese was melted into some rubbery plastic inedible texture.. The mushroom and buns were dried out.\n\nThe fries were good! We enjoyed those - the sweet potato and garlic fries each came with their own \"Caribbean\" and \"Mediterranean\" ketchup dips, which were fantastic. \n\nI think it really comes down to what you order.. I wouldn't return unless it were for their duck wings and fries."

            "review": "An overall regrettable dining experience. The hostess was unapproachable or dare I say, \"bitchy.\" Also, we had no server once we were seated - a random server came up to us to let us know, explicitly, that he wasn't our server but he will take our drink orders. As we were ready to order, we also had to place our order with our not-so-server, but we kept having to flag him down to ask questions about the menu. I was irritated since we didn't receive a proper introduction, recommendation or detailed explanation of the menu.\n\nUnfortunately, we were seated in a booth that shares the same corner as the staff's registers - what an awkward set-up. While we waited for our dinner we heard, loud and clear, server conversations; bickering and critiquing each-other. We also couldn't avoid hearing an earful of servers singing, obnoxiously. It's not a comfortable ambiance for us to relax in each others presence, or even enjoy private conversation.\n\nThe food was laughable. There was only one dish that we could honestly recommend and it was $13 ghost pepper chicken wings. That's it? The menu seems very confused and I'm sure the chef is just as confused.\n\nLet's go through the items we tried:\n\nGhost pepper wings ghost chili BBQ and green ranch chili sauce $13 -Shockingly, this was the only item of the evening that we actually enjoyed. I loved the perfect balance of sweetness and the spicy heat offered in the ghost chili BBQ sauce. The ranch consistency was watery, but the flavor was unique and delicious. The wings were cooked properly and had a decent amount of moist meat. But seriously. Wings are wings, you aren't really missing anything here. Flavor rating: 4/5\n\nSticky belly steamed buns $9 - Total white-boy style (in a bad way) we weren't a fan of the dry, hard bao bun, tough, overcooked thick cut bacon & weird tangy salad dressing sauce. Also, the cabbage slaw looked wilted and brown. I've had my share of tasty baos in Vegas (try: Bachi Burger, Gordon Ramsey BurGR, Fat Choy) and this sits at the very bottom of the list. This dish needs major work. Blegh. Flavor rating: 2/5\n\nLow country shrimp and grits $10 -  A serious disappointment. The \"crispy pork belly\" was a prank that was written on the menu description. It's actually tiny bits of chopped (hard) bacon. The fishy, tiny, frozen shrimp was offensively over-salted and lacking substantial cajun flavor. The grits were dry and bland and tasted like oatmeal, plus the cheddar cheese was sparse. All amateur mistakes. Flavor rating: 2/5\n\nSweet potato fries with Caribbean ketchup $4 - They arrived at our table room temperature and stale; we sent them back for a re-do. I was offended that we couldn't even get freshly fried sweet potatoes and that they offered us unwelcome fries from a heat lamp. The fries were standard, the ketchup was unique - but it's still nothing to write home about. You may want to go the extra mile and request some of the green chili ranch to pair with these fries - they work well together. Flavor rating: 2/5\n\nAfter a disenchanting dinner, we were ready to leave our experience far behind us. This place is not for us and probably not for you either if you appreciate your taste buds."

The garlic shoestring fries with the jerk ketchup and the Cinnamon sweet potato fries were perfect! My one year old loved them too! For dinner, I had the \"Big A- Eggroll\" and my husband had the lobster and crab mac and cheese. Mine was good, a little spicy and tough to chew, but good flavor. I tried the Mac and cheese and it was surprisingly good! I normally think Mac and cheese is bland, but with the lobster and crab, it was great! We got a cherry homemade pop tart for dessert, and I have to say, it was the most disappointing part of the meal. It was cold and kinda soggy and the icing was too sweet. But, overall, it was a great place, good food, great service, and I'd definitely go back and bring friends!"

It didn't even need a lot of the salad dressing because it was so flavorful. \nMy sister got a salmon salad and this was soooo good. It was on a bed of cabbage and the dressing was slightly spicy. \nThe server was very friendly and made sure she took care of us. \nThey had a really delicious breakfast menu too.

We were handed menus and it took awhile for our server to take our order. \n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes: salted caramel French toast, an omelette, filet mignon with eggs, two of the breakfasts, and two burgers. We ordered the french toast as an \"appetizer\"\n\nThe salted caramel french toast was average, it was warm and the caramel added just enough sweetness that I didn't need to add maple syrup. \n\nAlmost everything else was horrible. First off, it took over 30 minutes for our food to come out. If the restaurant was busy, I'd understand, but it wasn't busy at all. And when our food did come out, it was grim. We asked for eggs to be scrambled soft and they came out like hard jello. The omelette was completely cold. The hash browns that come with the meal were disgusting. I understand that they melt cheese on top of it, but it was barely edible. The filet was supposed to be medium rare, but it came out black and blue. The only average things were the burgers and that's because they were hot.\n\nWe asked for the food to be sent back. Someone came out and talked to us, but made it seem like it was our fault that the food was like that. He told us that the omelette was going to seem cold because of the avocado on top. Yes, the avocado was cold, but I didn't realize eggs and bacon were supposed to get cold because of that too. He eventually took off the breakfasts that were sent back. \n\nDefinitely wouldn't recommend this place. There's so many better places on the Strip!"

Tom's Urban is a brand new, fresh, unique, delicious twist to a classic American cuisine for the whole family. The restaurant is gorgeous. Everything is modern- from the dozen flat screen televisions to the beautifully decorated walls. The staff was incredibly welcoming. We were warmly greeted at the entrance and shown to a comfortable circular booth. Our waiter, Alex was fantastic. He's the type of waiter we all enjoy- down to earth and able to answer any type of question. I was extremely impressed by the menu. All items had a unique twist, like a \"Big Ass Eggroll\" and a \"Korean BBQ Burger\". We made up our minds and ordered. The appetizer, Buffalo Wings, came. They were spectacular. A spicy chili sauce coated the six meaty wings. They were juicy inside and had a buttery finish. Definitely a wing to write home about. For the main course I enjoyed a burger and fries which were perfectly prepared. Tom's offers a half pound burger cooked to your liking. The fries were shoestring cut with a garlic finish. The food was perfect and I can't wait to come back to Tom's on my next visit to Vegas."

It was a four egg omelet and came with hash browns and toast for 13.50. The omelet was cooked perfectly folded American style and they did not skip on the toppings. Each bite including the edges had bacon. The hash browns were the BEST hash browns I have ever had. They were crispy and not super greasy they were filled with a cheese that I forget the name of and I ate most of them before I realized how much I had eaten. I also received the wheat toast which came with preserves. Not sure if it is house made but it was absolutely delicious even the table next to ours was blown away. My girlfriend ordered the traditional breakfast which was 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, hash browns, and toast. I can't remember the price of hers. But she also ordered one pancake ala carte. The traditional breakfast for her was perfect same type of hash browns and the eggs were cooked with out being watery or over cooked. The bacon she ordered came out crisp and perfect. The pancake she got was the size of the plate and came with a salted caramel butter and warm maple syrup. I tried the salted caramel butter myself and was instantly a fan. I usually do not like caramel but this was balanced enough that the caramel flavor was not over powering. \n\nThe service we received from Nicole was wonderful she gave us a \"tour\" of the menu when we first arrived. And was always there when we needed her. We never had to ask for refills on anything. She even grabbed me more cream after my 3rd cup of coffee without me asking. \n\nThis place has become my new favorite in Vegas and will continue to return on any future trips. Wish I could give this place more stars."

Unfortunately there was not enough salt on the steak to taste good but there was pink sea salt shaker on the tablet which provided a mild salty taste. The steak was beautifully cooked.

I go with a group of 8 girls to get lunch, and our server tells us she can give us the bottomless mimosas for $19 (which ends at 1) if she punches it in the system before 1 pm. So its 12:50 and she checks all our ID's and brings us the first round. Next thing we know, the manager walks over and tells us he can't accommodate that, after she's already charged us for it, and tells us he can bring us \"one more round to be nice\"... First off, none of us would have ordered mimosas in the first place if our server hadnt told us she would still serve us bottomless after 1 pm. So we talk to the manager again, he's completely unwilling to compromise with us and then after 15 minutes of arguing back and forth he agrees to give us two mimosas for the price of what one costs. They bring us back a round of 8 glasses of literal orange juice, thinking we wouldn't notice. As if the cheap ass manager couldn't just do one thing right. So a random bartender, Spencer, probably sees that this manager has half a brain and comes over with a bottle of champagne and fixes the problem immediately. THATS ALL WE WANTED. We just wanted what we paid for. On top of all of this, our food was cold, and everytime we asked for something, like napkins, they literally ignored our existence.

I just had couple drinks but it was nice to experience such a quality service despite of the late hours we came in. Our bartender Ilan was the greatest!!! Positive attitude, pleasant personality and oh my..that cocktail he made!!! Exactly what you need after a long evening at work! \nThank you!!"

It was honestly probably one of my favorite drinks ever. I had the Thai salmon as my entree. It came with plentiful veggies and a large filet, but the sauce was very spicy. Too spicy for my liking, as it made it not enjoyable to eat. The fish was cooked perfectly however, and it was still a delicious meal. \n\nThey serve breakfast all day, and this seemed to probably be the way to go. Apparently they make their own PopTarts! \n\nIt was chilly when we went, but the patio looks like a fun place to eat out on. They do have heating lamps, but it was a bit too chilly in November for us to brave it outside.\n\nOverall, this is one of the most memorable meals i had in Vegas. Prices are a bit crazy, but it's Vegas...and unlike most of the restaurants you leave without feeling ripped off."

I was extremely disappointed to see that the only plant based options were sides like sweet potato fries and edamame. I think that it is very important for a restaurant to have at least one vegan option for those of us with dairy and meat sensitivities (or for those of us who also just don't want to consume animal products for ethical reasons).\nI ended up having a pizza. I got the truffle, portobello mushroom, and arugula pizza - it was pretty good but my stomach was most definitely not happy with me afterwards."

So this restraunt is located on the Northern side of New York New York.  This restraunt has a beautiful outside seating area with a bar and the luxury of watching the people on the strip.  This time we decided on sitting inside only because it was a rather hot October day and we had walked from where we parked at Paris Las Vegas.  This is one recommendation I do have: since you will be walking all along the strip I suggest parking in a central location so that at the end of sightseeing you don't have to walk to the other end of the strip.  So for me a day my friends do the central location was at Paris Las Vegas.  \nAs we sat inside I noticed that the booths in the middle of the restraunt were very unique.  They were full Booth seats that wrapped around the table with an opening at each end.  I thought this was a very cool concept.  \nAnywho onto what you've been waiting for, THE FOOD!!  OK so sometimes you really can't help what your tummy wants and you end up getting the slider cheeseburgers.  Which I will say are amazing!! The flavor of the meat with the melted cheese and toasted bun was basically burger heaven.  It does come with a choice of garlic fries and I'm sure something else buy once my tummy heard garlic fries there was no swaying it.  Now usually when I think garlic fries I think fries with garlic salt.  Oh no not these fries. I believe they took a garlic bath and came out perfectly seasoned which means no normal ketchup for these fried spuds yes friends I'm talking special seasoned ketchup. OK sorry drooled a bit lol\nAnother thing that I would also like to say about this amazing place was that they have an open entrance which means kind of an open wall.  I mention this because during lunch we had some little birdy friends enter and hop around.  They were so cute.\nThis is basically a higher end comfort food place with prices that won't kill your wallet and leave something for all the souvenirs.  Highly recommend trying this place it's amazing"

I'm still shocked about my experience here, and hopefully my input might possibly save you from leaving completely disappointed. \n\nThe decor and the concept of the restaurant is beautiful and fabulous. HDTVs everywhere, it's simple which would lead you to believe that they serve great food here. The service here is fast and friendly. To be honest with you, my server accidentally made a mistake on my order and I wasn't even mad at that. Everyone makes mistakes. The server was friendly, and provided excellence service. Even the manager was also around asking for feedback and checking on customers. When you have those components at a eatery it usually leads to great things. \n\nHowever, I would avoid this place because the food is M E D I O C R E! What puts the cherry open top is the prices. I ordered a Carnitas Cubano, the presentation looked like a normal grilled cheese sandwich but the only thing I tasted in the sandwich was mustard. And they charged 15 dollars for a sandwich that tasted like mustard? It came with a kale salad which didn't have anything appealing to it. It also didn't have any dressing. The menu is overpriced and not worth the value. 18 dollars for nachos? The place just leads you on for a epic let down. Just to put this into perspective, Earl of Sandwich cost 7 dollars for a sandwich and its taste great. They're too many places on the strip that charge half of what Tom Urban charges for more appetizing food. \n\nSo honestly, I don't think good service nor the manager can change my mind about this place until the food actually is appetizing. I don't understand how this place is holding down a 4 star rating?\nThis the only meal I've ever regret having in Vegas."

Especially for a meal at 12:30am on a Friday night. \n\nAs much as I enjoy eating out, I am not enthusiastic about eating out when visiting Vegas. I expect every restaurant in and near the hotels to offer decent options. I also expect most to have a cool, trendy or themed decor but that's about it. And usually the places are good, but you could easily leave just as satisfied if you had gone to the place next door instead. Or having grabbed a slice of pizza from the fast food joint. Tom's Urban has changed my mind. The food is so much more than the Vegas status quo of decent food.\n\nThe menu was pretty extensive and most items (breakfast, sandwiches and spiked milkshakes) are offered 24/7. And if you are having a difficult time choosing between the sweet potato fries and the famous shoestring garlic fries, you can get half and half. How's that for awesome and accommodating?!?!\n\nAfter a long day and no plans of retreating, we decided to refuel, enjoy the sights, lights and a different location on the strip. We perused the menu and decided to stop in. From the moment we sat down until the time we left, we were pleased. And I seriously enjoyed our dining experience enough to have double back which says a lot. \n\nThe service was phenomenal, the patio seating is one of the best on the strip, the food was absolutely, positively delicious and my drink was superb. If I had to choose one word the describe this visit, it would be outstanding. \n\nI came, I thoroughly enjoyed it and will return."

All I can relate to you is our experience here for breakfast on 7/7/15 - and it was great!\n\nThe host at the lectern outside seated us right away. We requested seating inside, as it was already blazing hot outside. This guy had a lot of tattoos and long hair and looked like a rocker, but despite the gruff appearance, he was SO friendly and nice, we warmed up to him immediately. And our server was a doll; very attentive, brought us waters and drinks right away, went over the menu and gave good feedback on the many, many options. \n\nI forget what hubby ordered but he liked it a lot. It was some commonplace breakfast fare. I ordered a veggie omelet which was huge, and I gave most of it to my husband. It was delicious, albeit a tad too buttery for me. \n\nPortions were large and, we thought a great value for the prices charged.\n\nA shout-out to the interior decor and color scheme. We really loved the vibe here: soft, cool aquas and warm ambers, suspended glass orb lighting, wood planks as art panels on the wall... it all made for a soothing, warm dining environment. A nice change of pace from the frenetic neon decors of the Strip. And it was cool how the exterior wall to the Strip was totally opened up, so this was more of an inside-outside space. Very airy and open and large. \n\nWe loved this place and our meal here and agreed, we'd definately return."

The menu looked amazing, it looked like a really cute hip new gastropub-esque place. \nI went there for brunch with my fianc\u00e9 on a Sunday. That was my first mistake: going anywhere on a Sunday afternoon. I'm really not a football fan and toms urban is right next to the NY NY sports book so of course the rowdy fans trickle into the bar to get drinks and scream at the TV over men in spandex. I just don't get football fans and I couldn't escape the game. It was on every TV in the restaurant and I think there were at least ten big screens. Anyway-\nThe staff was nice enough but the service wasn't really that great. It wasn't that busy and it took five minutes for our server to even greet us and about ten minutes for my bloody to get to me (I was sitting right by the bar). The server forgot our napkins which wasn't a big deal but it's something worth noting when the GM had to fetch us napkins instead of our server. \nOn top of the staff being sort of inattentive they only serve bottomless mimosas till 1 pm, and after that a mimosa is $13. I know it's the strip but $13 for a single mimosa? A glass of champagne was between $6-$8 so why the extra 7 dollars just to add a splash of juice?? It seemed very strange to me. While on the topic of drinks they do have a lot of beers on tap, some of them local which impressed me. Always gotta support your local breweries! \nThe menu as mentioned earlier is spectacular. They have all day breakfast, small plates, and entrees. I ended up getting the green chile carnitas Mac & cheese pot with crispy Brussels sprouts. The Mac and cheese was so good, cheesy without being too rich. And the carnitas was very tender and flavorful. The Brussels had a balsamic glaze and were excellent. I'm so glad to see Brussels coming back in popularity. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the pickle brine fried chicken with garlic shoestring fries. I would say it's the best friend chicken I've ever next to blue ribbon fried chicken. The pickle brine was perfect and the green chile remoulade was excellent for dipping. \nI would probably come back here again if a friend wanted to go with me, but definitely NOT on any Sunday's between now and February."

He actually returned with the same glass; half doctored-up by us, and half doctored-up by the bartender, and it was awful! Strange method for fixing up a broken cocktail.

When it finally arrived, we were treated with burnt toast, over-cooked eggs, a lack of condiments, and more.\n\nAll in all, unless you want to spend a good 2-3 hours at a restaurant that delivers inedible food and terrible customer service, my friends and I definitely would not recommend this place."

Overpriced food attempting to be chic, horrible selection of beers unless you're a metrosexual hipster that pretends to love swill and horse water (a euphemism). \n\nHonestly, I'd be surprised if any of the food isn't prepackaged. It might as well be the cardboard packaging itself, as both my wife's and my food were totally bland and utterly tasteless.\n\nAgain, the service... Don't go here unless you enjoy being ignored. And if you do wish to be ignored, why not go across the street to Dick's Last Resort where there is at least comedy entertainment value. Whoever imagined this place was sorely mistaken. Don't be fooled, the menu items appear palatable and creative, they aren't. The service appears friendly and expedient, it isn't. People were dissatisfied in droves. \n\nEat here if you want to take part in disappearing Vegas history, because this place is about to be demolished for something bigger, better, and grander.\n\nBleecccchhh!"

When I arrived to check in however, the girl at the front said they don't do bar reservations that it was all open seating.  Okay, so why did the other girl tell me it was fine to reserve the seats - even asked if there was a certain game on that I wanted to be put on the tv. (It was Sunday and we were there for football)    Speaking of asking what I want to watch on tv - we were snapped at when we asked to change the tvs to a different game and were told that managers pre set everything and they couldn't be switched.   \n\nThe service was awful.  Everyone in that place looked like they had just rolled out of bed.  Maybe that's why they moved so incredibly slow ? My bartender, who never mentioned her name, was less than inviting.  Maybe the service industry just isn't for her ?  She seemed very overwhelmed with the three tickets in her well.   My bacon bloody was far from hand crafted.   It was poured straight from a container.  Whenever we wanted a Refill on our bottomless mimosas - that are served in a stemless wine glass - we were forced to ask.  And then wait.  I feel like all we did was wait.  20 minutes just to take our order is crazy.  Learn to multitask.  Food was alright at best.   We left at halftime.   The only reason we even stayed that long was to watch the game."

The hostess was rude and her attitude appeared as you were bothering her.  The waiter seemed more interested in sitting with the table behind us chit chatting for a good five minutes per visit instead of taking our order or checking on how we were doing.  We got a glass of ice water that had cilantro stuck on the glass.\n\nDecided on ordering one of \"Tom's Favs\" which was their steak nachos and also their mahi mahi fish tacos.  Nothing special about the nachos...it had multi color tortilla chips, cheddar cheese sauce, SOME shredded cheese, leftover steak (you can taste that it wasn't fresh), a tiny serving each of guacamole paste and dressing, sour cream, and a little bit of salsa.  The fish tacos were extremely dry...no sauce or anything to go with it.  Just the fish, some lettuce or cabbage and a lime wedge on top of a corn tortilla.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere was nice, but the table set ups were kinda weird.  I guess they want to be \"different\" and to each their own.  I think it could be a happening place if their service and food was better.  For the price you pay ($21.95 for a burger by itself) you would think this place would be more upscale and have amazing food to brag about, but it's not and they don't."

Sweet with a little hit of heat and just the right amount of crunch. The serving was of four wings but they were large drumettes, not the mid-sections, like I somehow imaged they'd be. We were contemplating ordering the calamari and our server steered us away from them, saying they weren't all that great. Kudos for the honesty - you don't get that from waitstaff very often. \n\nNext, we put in an order for the Butter Poached Lobster and Shrimp tacos. We had high hopes and weren't disappointed in the least. A chipotle aioli played great against a crema with cilantro and the seafood was cooked perfectly. The two of us hadn't eaten since breakfast and were starving and wanted to try one more thing, so we wrapped up with an order of Shrimp and Grits. Again, the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The grits were the right consistency, but were a little underseasoned - nothing a couple of grinds of sea salt couldn't rectify.\n\nWe're in Vegas three or four times a year and definitely plan to make Tom's Urban a regular stop. There are plenty of great places to eat in town, but this one not only has a fun, eclectic menu, but it's executed well."

Loved the Brussel Sprouts and Potstickers, and the portions are really good for the price.  The sauce that comes with the Brussel Sprouts was delicious but I preferred to eat the Potstickers without the sauce. The tacos only come with one taco, but the Banh Mi was very flavorful and hubby liked that better than the Mahi Mahi.  Delicious food and great prices if you can get the Beat the Clock!"

The outside patio was full, so we were happy enough to eat inside.  My husband found the seating to be somewhat uncomfortable, and said it felt like he was going to slip off the back of the chair. \n\nAs we started to review the menu we noticed that the omelettes were made with four eggs.  Holy heck, that is one big omelette, let's just share.  We went with a Denver, hash browns, and my husband got a side of grits, and I added a side of fruit.  This was plenty of food to share. I will say that the omelette was a bit overdone and dry. It was crispy around the edges.   \n\nOur server was prompt, and quick to refill my Husbands coffee.  The bloody Mary's here are also very good."

NYNY is one of my favorite hotel/casinos on the strip; I love that you don't get that fancy and pretentious feel you get in a lot of hotels and casinos, although I know this is what many people prefer-  but not me! I decided to sit at the smaller bar that is almost a part of the casino. The actual restaurant is bigger than I thought it was and it looks like they have a nice seating area out on their patio which is right on the strip. I ordered the pork belly tacos as I read on yelp that they were a good choice. They were excellent, some of the best tacos I've ever had. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas to get a second round of these yummy tacos and try some of the other dishes on their menu. The bartender told me this place had only been open for 2 weeks, and in my opinion they're doing a great job! Bartender was friendly and asked me about my trip without being annoying or overbearing. I didn't get a drink but my water was kept full the entire time, great and friendly service. This was my best dining experience during my trip to Vegas- would recommend and will definitely be back!"

Literally NO one was on this restaurant. We had our mind set and ready to order. We asked a gentleman to ask for our server because it was time to order. (11pm happy our time). We kept waiting hoping Lisa would come, but she was just standing with her Co worker at our eye site looking at us and not doing anything at all. It's past 15 minutes, no water, no service we all decided to just leave the place. Being LOCAL checking out this new place.

What a way to end my already horrible CES stay in Vegas.\n\nI had a comp from MLIFE -- because I dropped $2k on the tables -- that I figured I should use before I leave. Tom Urban was the new spot at New York, New York so I thought, why not?\n\nThe comp was $49 dollars, which was plenty to have breakfast, even if I decided to get the most expensive thing on the menu.\n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon and Eggs and a side of pancakes, because, why not? The filet mignon and eggs came out at a decent time, but not the pancakes. I went to cut into my steak only to realize I didn't have a steak knife. So after waiting 5-minutes my waitress to come back to check on me, and for me to ask for a damn knife, I picked away at the eggs and potatoes. They were just.. ok.\n\nI finally get my knife and cut into the filet mignon medallions. They were bloody red, which wasn't what I ordered. I asked for medium and it was far too rare.\n\nAt this point I'm just annoyed, even if this wasn't my money paying for the meal. Now 20-minutes into my meal and the pancakes are still missing. You can tell the waitress forgot to put in that order with the way she was talking to the other help. When I finally receive the pancakes I noticed one is missing, but say nothing. I knew I wasn't going to be eating all of them, but wanted to at least taste them.\n\nAbout 15-minutes after eating the pancakes and finishing up the rest of my meal a waiter comes over and says, \"I'm so sorry, you were suppose to have 3 pancakes, not 2. I'm going to bring another one over to you.\" In which I said, are you serious?\n\nNow on to the fun part. The food poisoning. I'm going to go ahead and say it was the meat. The filet mignon was not good.. at all. I only took a few bites of it, and that's all I can think about making me sick.\n\nTo the management of Tom Urban: I know you're new and all, but that's no excuse for shit service and bad food."

What I'm not crazy about is the food. It's average at best. Sticky belly buns ($9) suffered from hard buns, overassessed pork belly and a slaw drowning in liquid reminiscent of a dirty mop soaking in a bucket. They don't have a kids menu but offered kid-sized portions of their cheese pizza (which was overcooked) and chocolate shake. On the brighter side, the ginger chicken potstickers ($8) showcased a nice sear and ample filling, while the bacon avocado burger's ($17) chargrilled, well seasoned patty between toasted brioche reminded me why I'm a fan of Smashburger (also created by restaurateur Tom Ryan). It's a simple, well executed, juicy and greasy burger that satisfies that craving. Washing it down with their Kraken spiced rum salted caramel shake ($13.50) was the perfect way to say F-you to my sometimes healthy eating habits. It was a touch heavy on alcohol (that's not really a complaint) and I was surprised to hear that waitresses are responsible for creating the shakes, not the kitchen or bar staff.\n\nWith a location right on the Strip in the boulevard/district area off of NYNY leading to the under construction arena, they'll probably stay busy. Unfortunately, it won't be because the food is a hit."

Shrimp po boy sliders were okay in flavor (remoulade was on point!) but these were also quite dry thanks to the heavy-handed cornmeal breading. \n\nThe Bloody Mary was well balanced despite being a touch too salty for our taste.

Wanted it without bacon and ham (also has chicken) and was told they could not leave the ham out.  Weird, but I said okay - figured I could pick it out.  Chicken in the salad was nit grilled as stated and was very salty and processed tasting.  I am sure it was some kind of packaged pre-cooked chicken which I really hate.  I also felt that my salad was missing some other ingredients so I checked on-line later that night and I was right.  They left out the romaine, baby kale and goat cheese.

You should order \"She's My Niece\" (they changed the name but they shouldn't have) or \"WTF\" but really, they are probably all good. Also the sweet potato fries were nothing short of the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten. \n\nBeyond the food, I loved the atmosphere; it was casual and fun looking. The music was eclectic and fantastic, it was like having my iPod on shuffle back before streaming music. \n\nAnd our waitress Davina, was quite entertaining and nice. The service at many places during CES was boring and not great, likely because it was busy, but this place - wonderful. She really made the experience. \n\nI came in with reasonable expectations and was blown away. \n\nIt's great."

The outdoor seating area and cool decor appealed to us, as did the rather varied menu. \n\nLiked: the terrace decor with its high tables, colorful lanterns, elaborate bar with cobalt, turquoise and pink hanging bottles. Plus the view of the Vegas strip without all the noise - a nice compromise between feeling the Vegas vibe but getting a bit of peace too. It was a fresh, welcome change from stuffy and formal hotel restaurants. Also liked the fact that they did not shy away from using condiments and spices in the food: both our dishes had a nice kick to them. The soft drinks were refilled for free which was a nice surprise. Our waitress was well-informed and efficient. \n\nDisliked/ could have been better: the food albeit tasty lacked that wow factor. My chicken tacos were not served as piping hot as I would have liked them to be (which i.a. made them look a bit trite) and the chicken carried a little too much fatty skin (I found myself examining each piece and cleaning it up before eating it). The leaves in my boyfriend's salad looked a little tired and weren't as crunchy and fresh as they could have been. My rhum and ginger beer/ lemon drink tasted ok but I would have expected the ginger beer to make it extra fizzy - instead it was kind of flat.\n\nOverall, an ok dining experience - if I went back I'd try other dishes to get a better idea of the restaurant's true pedigree."

Lobster & Shrimp Mac n Cheese: One would think that the dish is rich and creamy with delicious seafood. The Mac n cheese was decent and flavorful, but the lobster tasted very dry and overcooked along with the shrimp. I would skip this one (3/5)\n\n2. NYNY Strip: The steak came out burnt and dry. The picture would say otherwise, but it didn't taste so great in the mouth. It came with sweet potato fries, which were decent, along with Moroccan ketchup. The ketchup was okay. For a pricey meal, it just wasn't worth it (3/5)\n\nService was decent, but we could tell that they kind of wanted us out of the place - that sucks, one shouldn't feel rushed to finish eating; we are the customers! But anyways, for the price that you pay for the meal, it just doesn't match up to par with the quality you expect from the food."

The chicken in the potsticker had a nice flavor to it that thr sauce really compliments.\n\nThe burger... I had not had a burger with a fried egg as a topping, not before, not ever. After hearing my boss rave about the Korean burger, I instantly found myself searching for a burger, in general. The server (very polite and attentive) recommended the Sin City burger so I went with it. It looked good when it was brought to my table and I noticed that it was something that I wanted to finish, but might not make it (large burger) ha! I did get my burger sans bacon and onions, and I'm now regretting omitting the bacon. I had been worried about the bbq sauce conflicting with the egg... but I wanted to try it as it was (as much as I could do, diet wise) so I left it and holy bbq! It went so well! The bbq especially complimented the grill produced crunch that the burger had around the outside. I think I've found my new favorite specialty burger :)"

He made sure we were taken care of for our entire meal. We were so happy, we asked to talk to the manager to give him and his employees kudos for helping making our New Year's epic and memorable.\n\nThe food was also AMAZING. We ordered a few appetizers and it was a great amount of food to fill us up. I suggest the brussel sprouts. Blue did and they are to die for.\n\nThat being said, I will be sad if I don't see a Tom's Urban opening in Salt Lake City in the next year."

I have to continuously call the waiter over - first to fill an empty water glass and then to ask for ketchup after he delivered a sandwich with French fries.  \n      Our waiter (Tim) was about as bad as a waiter could be.  Inattentive, grab-assing with the other wait staff while we were trying to flag him down, and reaching across the table in front of me to reach my wife's glass (instead of walking around to her side of the table.  Really bad in so many levels.\n      The food was extremely mediocre - pulled pork sandwich was skimpy - roll was soggy, and the sauce was weak.  Sweet potato fries were over salted.  The Margherita pizza consisted of undercooked dough, what tasted like Ragu pizza sauce, and a melted string cheese stick.  Top this off with our waiter, Tim, serving it with his thumb firmly planted in a slice, mmmm delicious.  Not.\n     The music was loud and competed with different music coming from outdoor speakers beyond the patio and a street electric guitarist.  The drinks were expensive but I am giving the place 1 star because of its perfect patio location - great for people watching.  So, other than the food, the wait staff, and the pricey drinks - this place rocks."

It was a great place to sit outside and people watch while enjoying delicious food (potstickers and bleu chicken sliders were fantastic).  We liked it so much we decided to return the next day for breakfast (fresh mushrooms in the omelettes - YUM!!). Then we simply couldn't resist returning for a late afternoon Urban Spike Milkshake. Our waiter Nate told us to go w the Bacardi Coconut Chocolate, and he didn't steer us wrong. And Spencer was the man that made the milkshake magic!  Our only regret is not requesting an extra shot of rum. Everyone from the hostess to the bartender was great."

Then I ordered the small mac and cheese, the shrimp po boy sliders and a bourbon bacon bloody mary.\n\nThis place is gorgeous and colorful and has a patio right on the strip. I'm glad shake shack was too packed to take us, otherwise, I wouldn't have popped my head in here. Menu is a standard $10-25 but can be more with a steak or drinks or what not. The food was great.\n\nMac & Cheese- this small plate isn't a small plate and it came piled with pico de gallo and shreaded meat. I've never had this twist on a mac & cheese before and not sure if I loved it. BUT I love the idea of it. On any other given day, I would order this as would anybody else. Who doesn't want a crack mac and cheese?\n\nShrimp po boy sliders- came with 3 of these babies. Same thing, I loved the concept. The shrimp was battered and fried and I prefer them grilled but It was still good. \n\nThe bourbon bloody mary- Was ok. 3 stars. It was more ice than blood mary and it was poorly garnished. And normally a bacon bloody mary comes with a strip of crispy bacon but this one didn't. \n\nAnyhow, our waiter was super friendly, attentive, and asked if we needed a split check at the BEGINNING instead of the mess at the end. Greatly appreciated it."

It was perfect for us because we don't like crowded restaurants. \n\nOur server Shwan, was great! He helped us pick out a couple of beers which we enjoyed very much.  \n\nWe had the Sin City Burger and the Street Tacos plate.  The burger was delicious! Well cooked and the flavors really came together.  The fried egg was interesting and egg-citing!!! (sorry)  The egg had an earthy, home style flavor which complemented the richness of the bbq sauce and fried onions.\n\nI ordered the 5 taco place which included one of each kind of taco on the menu.  My favorite was the pork belly taco based on the mingling of sweet and tangy flavors.  The pork belly was a little bit off putting visually but it is like a think cut bacon.  \n\nThe taco I enjoyed the least was the shrimp and lobster.  The sauces and fixings on the taco were overpowering to the lobster and shrimp. They were too heavy.  The shrimp and lobster would have been lovely with just a little pico de gallo, perhaps a tiny amount of butter sauce and a squeeze of lemon.  I ended up picking out the lobster and leaving the rest of the taco.  \n\nFinally were surprised with a free birthday dessert.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  I wish we were able to return next week."

This was slightly better but there is nothing that inspires me to return.  We ordered lunch here on Saturday 5/14 and sat right at the edge where the inside and outside meet.  The weather was great and that was probably the best part of the lunch.\n\nOur server was nice but as has been the case with Tom's Urban twice now, the staff doesn't do a good job of keeping on their customers.  Our waters went unfilled several times and in general, while there are a lot of people running food, it seems way too scattered.  It must just be the chain in general.\n\nWe started with the Double Dip Hummus with was good but they short you on the pita bread so you end up with half of your dip left without anything to dip with.  So we ordered more pita bread which came out burnt to a crisp so that was that.  \n\nMy wife ordered the Urban Street Tacos.  She to two of the shrimp and lobster and one of the mahi mahi.  The mahi mahi was terrible.  She said it was basically unedible.  The other two were good however.  \n\nI ordered the Boulder Club and specifically asked for it to come without avocado and of course it arrives with a nice heaping pile of avocado on it.  It was a bit dry otherwise and the bread was over-toasted which seems to be a theme here.  \n\nSince we are 0-2 on this restaurant and that's in two different states, I doubt we will try it again."

Exceptionally low quality food, mediocre service, poor serving choices (plastic cups!?), and WAY overpriced. Avoid at all costs. \n\nFirst of all, EXPENSIVE. EXPENSIVE. Yes it's on the strip and yes I understand it's a tourist trap, but I'm not a tourist I'm a local. If you're a local, stay far away from this place. There are spots on the strip that don't charge exorbitant prices just because they can. This is not one of those spots. This place just wants your money.\n\nI ordered \"Al Carbon\" steak nachos and a milkshake. Let's start with the milkshake.\n\nFirst, it came out in a plastic cup. A Solo cup-sized plastic cup, and it wasn't full. Second, it is quite thick, and comes with the same straws they use for the water. I can't drink it without the straw because I'll look like some kind of milk-mustached 3 year old. I can't use a spoon because there weren't any on the table. I can't use the straw it came with because the straw is far too small and the shake is much too thick. A buddy of mine grabbed me a big straw from the restaurant next door on his way in. The flavor was not good, just super sweet. A low-quality shake for sure. And on top of not being able to drink it, and not being very good, and being a very small quantity of shake in a plastic cup, it costs $8. WHAT A JOKE.\n\nSteak nachos were awful. The meat was overcooked and poorly seasoned. The quality of the meat itself was extremely low. I asked for no cilantro, it came out covered in cilantro. The cheese and cheese sauce combination was terrible. The chips were cheap junk. There is nothing good to say about them. They also cost $18.\n\nOur server was nice enough; she made a couple jokes and we got along fine, but she really didn't care about us as customers. She saw when she came by to refill drinks that I hadn't touched my nachos. (Because they were awful.) She never asked if they were alright (they were disgusting), she never asked if anything was wrong with them (they were covered in cilantro after I asked her for none), in fact the only thing she ever asked me about them was if I was finished. She didn't ask if I wanted a box when she came to take them away, so she obviously knew I was unhappy with them. Same lack of interest for all the others I was with."

The presentation was totally unappetizing (wilted greens with sad garlic slices). The Mac and cheese with pork and green chile was the best of bunch, but definitely not memorable. \n\nExpensive mediocre food for a casual restaurant. \n\nThey have a nice strip-view deck that will be lovely in the summer.

This may be a decent-enough option for all-hours dining on the Strip, but as a local, it's not a place I'll seek out to revisit.\n\nThe killer shrimp and grits dish I experienced at a Yelp event fell flat when I came back and received a bland, boring version with cold, flavorless shrimp. The duck wings are a delight, but the regular wings were dry and unappetizing. The prime rib philly was the only version of prime rib I've ever seen my guy refuse to take more than a few bites of: it was overly salty, tough, and generally not appealing. The drinks were okay, they just took our entire meal to get.\n\nAll in all, I'm not impressed. Pare down the menu, retrain your servers, and try again. If I'm in the area in need of a quick, tasty bite, I'll be heading to Shake Shack instead... and it's not because I'm a big burger fan."

            "review": "My summer fishing buddy back on Cape Cod in 1976 was named Tom. This was the summer after Jaws took the world by storm, so the vibe on the Cape at that time was surreal. I'd liken it to San Francisco just 7 years prior but I wasn't there at the time (Vietnam). Anyway Tom and I spent a lot of time out on this little schooner in '76 tossing back beers and talking about fishing, about the war, and about bathrooms. Typical guy stuff. Tom would join Gloria and I at Seafood Sam's for fried clams (decent bathrooms there). After the summer of '76 Tom kind of dropped off the map. We didn't have the Facebooks back then so it's not like we could easily stay in touch. The only Tweeters we had were on our quadraphonic sound system loudspeakers :)\n\nI like to think maybe Tom moved out west and started his own restaurant chain. Typical American pub fare with beers and whatnot. Called it Tom's Urban. Turns out this Tom's Urban was started by a guy named Tom who also has a company that makes really flat griddled hamburgers. That doesn't sound like my ex-Gunnery Sergeant turned fishing buddy Tom. Trust me, my Tom wouldn't make a bathroom as despicable as the one at Tom's Urban on the strip in Vegas. We spent too much time on that little schooner off the Cape talking BRs (bathrooms) for him to have designed the literal \"S\"-hole I discovered at Tom's Urban.\n\nBeing that I was in town for the Indoor Ag-Con this past April (the \"Are container farms economically viable for commercial production\" session was riveting!) I needed to eat somewhere on the Strip relatively close to the Convention Center. Some Con buddies of mine and I (fellow green thumbs) chose to unwind after a long day of Conning with the Tom's urban Happy Hour. We requested outdoor seating on the patio overlooking the Strip near New York New York Casino and Resort. Our request was initially denied, but after a table of tourists paid their bill we were offered a great corner table on the patio.\n\nYou'll want to ask your server the location of the bathroom upon being seated. You won't see much of her during service and the beer offerings are a bit watered down (I gave up Old Style years ago, I'm a Belgian Quad man now). The sprawling bar and restaurant requires a bit of a hike to get to the bathroom. But once you find it (walk to the back, turn this-a-way, then that-a-way) you're in for a shock.\n\nTom's Urban, with it's seemingly hundreds of dining tables, countertops and bar seats, has ONE single-use bathroom for men. So, like, if you chose Tom's Urban as your desired destination to watch the upcoming Super Bowl (2017) you'd probably be fighting hundreds of gentleman for the privilege of relieving yourself in ONE. SINGLE. TOILET.\n\nFor what it's worth, the bathroom was quite clean and orderly. Nice tiles. Aromas of pine and citrus, with only a touch of chemical acidity. A low seated toilet (which is passable because I didn't have to sit to do my business this time) with a push-button flusher (which I later found out was also automatic, but that's besides the point). The problem with the push-button flusher is that in most men's rooms the toilet seat is ALWAYS in the upright position. It's almost impossible (with paper towels or toilet paper in hand) to hit the push-button flusher without some portion of your hand hitting the upright toilet seat. GROSS. The sink features both hot and cold faucets, with the requisite foam-y soap dispenser (whether it was anti-bacterial or not I do not know) nearby. Once again - and it seems like I always have to say this - if you're going to offer the option of air dryers, which most of today's youth prefer to a good old fashioned paper towel - you can't only have a bathroom door that opens into the bathroom. How many people do you think wash and dry their hands only to soil them again pulling the door open to exit the bathroom with their bare hands? I'll tell you who WON'T ever make that mistake. Me.\n\nUntil we can find a restaurateur who is forward-thinking enough to design an ergonomically sound bathroom that caters to the person who wants to come in contact with the least amount of surfaces possible, deplorable bathrooms like those at Tom's Urban chain of fast casual restaurants will continue to proliferate.\n\nThe Nashville Hot Chicken was delightfully spicy. The \"XL\" size was more than enough for one human male. I heard the Boulder Club was \"okay\" but \"sloppy\". The beer selection left much to be desired. Guinness and Shock Top? C'mon Tom, get your act together. Maybe next time (if they fix the bathroom issues I experienced) I'll try the mac and cheese skillet. It looked tasty."

It looked like street foods such as: burgers, tacos, wings, etc. My friend and I walked over and got a table immediately. It was pretty empty for a Friday night. When I saw the place, it looked like a big sports bar. \n\nI ordered the mahi mahi taco, chicken adobo taco, and a muy thai. The chicken adobo taco blew me away. The chicken was so flavorful. Really captured the adobo like flavors. the mahi mahi taco was alright. It didn't have much tuna in it and the tuna was not that flavorful. Almost couldn't taste the fish. The muy thai was tasty. First time having one and it was stronger than I thought. I felt the alcohol afterwards haha. \n\nMy friend got the roasted brussel sprouts and potstickers. The potstickers were good, but nothing special. The brussel sprouts were fantastic though. They fried them and then put it in balsamic. I thought it tasted like a soy sauce base, but it was just balsamic. Best I've ever had. Also got a cheesecake with raspberry drizzle. It was so good! the cheese part was nice and creamy. It was not overly thick, which is good because it is huge. \n\nPrices were not too bad for a place on the strip. This place has happy hour during many hours of the day. The earlier the time, the cheaper the food. It can get down to $4 an item (ie. a taco). Check it out! It's in New York New York."

We didn't have utensils -- which seemed to be happening to several other customers --  and since our waitress was nowhere to be found, I had to go find another waitress. I politely asked for utensils and she barely even acknowledged me and had an annoyed look on her face. I could maybe understand this type of service if the restaurant was really busy and understaffed, but it didn't appear that way.\n\nAfter eating, we noticed that the container on our table that held our utensils had some disgusting, dried up fries stuck to the bottom of it. So we realized we had ate off of the forks that were placed on top of that.\n\nThere were birds flying around inside the restaurant, and eating off of the floor, which I didn't really mind since it was kind of entertaining, but I'm sure other customers weren't as happy when they were flapping above their tables.\n\nOverall, would probably be 4 stars with better service and cleanliness, because the food was good and decently priced for The Strip."

First glance at the menu was overwhelming -- there were way too many things that sounded delicious. I wound up getting three tacos (Mix-and-Match, as you can see in the picture). If I remember correctly, I got pork (pork belly? Just shredded/carnitas? I don't remember.), lobster and shrimp, and carne asada tacos. I will say that Tom's Urban is definitely on the pricey side, but to get good food in Vegas, you tend to have to spend a lot of money, as made evident here -- the three tacos were about $20 on their own.\n\nOur table also split a side of fries, but I forget the seasoning that was on them. Rosemary garlic or something? I'm not quite sure, but they were very good, especially with the ketchup they had -- I think it was called Moroccan ketchup, or something like that. All three tacos were fantastic, and it's hard to pick a favorite, but I'd probably vote for the seafood ones. My reason for four stars though (other than the price) is that two of the three tacos had to be eaten with a fork because they fell right through the tortillas when they were picked up. My suggestion would be to simply double up the tortillas to prevent (or lessen the chance of) that happening.\n\nThe service left a bit to be desired as it was rather slow despite it being I believe 11:30 on a Thursday, but the food was tasty enough to have me give Tom's four stars. I'd likely revisit the next time I'm in Vegas."

He gave us honest recommendations and kept our party excited about the dining experience despite our jet lag! As for the actual food, it was a bit of a let down. Aside from the chicken lollipops the entrees lacked the meat promised in the dish. Taste is comparable to an Applebee's or Friday's. If I return I would try a sandwich or burger as I think that's what this restaurant would make best."

Our server Andrea seated is immediately in a comfortable booth, and got our drink orders. She brought our drinks immediately and got our food orders, making some recommendations. My friend T ordered a cuban and a kale side salad, and his wife E had the all American burger with regular fries. I got the Urban Chopped salad. Our food came out quickly, and our server was extremely attentive and friendly - I can't recall the last time I had such an excellent customer service experience dining on the strip. \n\nMy friends realized they had actually been there twice already during their visit but had eaten outside on the patio. They mentioned this to the server, and the manager Renzo even stopped over to thank them for their return visits - as he pointed out, there are so many choices in the area, it's a pretty big testament to food and service for someone on vacation to come back 3 times in a week!!\n\nMy salad was excellent! I live in the NW part of town and would venture back just for the salad! Such a great mix of flavors and textures. My friends really enjoyed their meals also! Since the lunch rush had cleared out, they paid and lingered to visit, and Andrea went above and beyond to still check on us, and offer us fresh water. It was an excellent meal, excellent service, and I will definitely be back....soon!"

The service was horrible not to mention that the waitress didn't even make eye contact with us. I had questions in regards to the menu and she made a face like I was stupid. Just ignored my question and basically told me are you going to order or if I'll come back when your ready. When she came back with my drink the glass was covered in fingerprints and food stains. I notified the hostess which seems like she felt bad. It took our waitress 15 mins to come back with my drink. When our food came out she passed by us and just said enjoy without stopping at our table. I didn't have utensils to eat my salad. We had to ask for our waitress to come to our table and ask her for them. She was aren't they in the holder umm no.. so she grabbed some from the table behind without even looking and left them on our table. We over heard other ppl at another table complain as well. Management didn't do anything..the only person that felt bad was the greeting hostess. For the price and experience I wouldn't recommend and if u do decide to eat here its at your own risk."

Maybe like a fancy upscale Dennys that serves wiked good Bloody Mary's and has over 21  beers on tap.\n\nOrdered the vegetarian eggs benedict, they were perfect. Opted for the side of asado hash browns, which ended up to be about half cup of cooked hash browns with a melted white cheese on top... good but slightly out of the ordinary. \n\nAlso shared the fig and three cheese panini, went for the piggy figgy (with bacon) which ended up meaning bacon in the panini and on the side... not sure if that's how it comes or if our waiter was off. Delish. Recommend sharing as it came with 3 halves and a side..  pick sweet potatoe fries!!\n\nAlso they have \"toms sized\" drinks. We didn't see the size differences listed on the menu so we asked our waiter what the difference was. He just said \"the size\"... Yea dude we get that part, but like the differences in ounces?? Ohhhhh, 22 vs. 16 oz. So think of Tom's size as a Venti, or about a Venti sized glass of alcoholic goodness. \n\nThey also have urban pop tarts. We missed out since they sold out, the waiter told us they were making more. But didn't give us the option to order when they were ready. Too bad!"

Nice decor, big bar, great location right on the strip. There is outdoor seating as well.\n\nService: Just ok.

It's probably the best choice out of the places in the New York New York hotel though! \n\n//TREEHUGGER BENEDICT (3/5): The definition of just o.k... One of my eggs had already been popped by the time the dish got to my table, the English muffins were too hard, and the hollandaise sauce has literally 0 flavor. AND it was an extra $2 to add bacon. On the bright side, the $2 were well spent because the bacon was cooked perfectly - chewy, crunchy, and not too oily. Also, the avocados were plentiful and super fresh. However, the one thing that completely saved this dish was the AMAZING HASH BROWNS! They were mixed with some cheesy goodness to make the potatoes really stringy and chewy, but not overwhelming... They were the best hash browns I've ever had at a brunch restaurant. \n\n//LEMON POPPYSEED BLUEBERRY PANCAKES (4.5/5): Suuuuper good and something I would definitely get again! It comes with sweet cream and salted caramel butter, which offered additional flavor to the already super lemony pancakes! I have really high standards for pancakes so I was impressed - it tasted like a lemon muffin but in pancake form! I just wish the pancake was toasted a little more so that the outside would be a little crispier. \n\nBasically, 2 defining items at this restaurant were the hash browns and the pancakes.

During certain hours, the prices of drinks and food would vary, from lowest prices about 4 pm, and higher prices into the evening. We got there about 6 pm, when the price for a selected menu was $6 each item, and the price of a drink was $7. These were supposed to be happy hour, or discounted, prices. The regular price for a draft of domestic beer was $7. I assumed the happy hour price would be less than $7, so I ordered 2 Buds. The price turned out to be $7 each. No discount at all. On the food menu, the regular price for the steak street tacos was $18, The price for the happy hour was $6. That looked like a good deal, so I ordered it. Several minutes later, the server brought out a corn tortilla, about the size of a small bagel. On it was a tiny amount of cheese, and a little spoonful of meat. I asked the waitress if this was the regular price, and she said the regular price of $18 was for three of these minuscule servings.  I pointed out that each would then be $6, which was the happy hour price. In other words, for the happy hour you get one taco for $6, but the regular price was 3 for $18, which is $6. So, the beer and the taco were exactly the same price for the happy hour and the regular menu. Very Deceptive. My advice - before ordering at this restaurant, be very careful. They really offer no happy hour deals. By the way, the taco was OK, but not worth $6. I would say a fair price for the tiny bite is 50 cents."

It wasn't busy at all the staff was just not that attentive. \n\nStill not a bad place, but a little overpriced and eh service."

I am writing this review at 3:58pm sitting in their patio with flies, bees, pigeons flying everywhere and deeply regretting spending $50 for an abysmal two person dining experience. Let's see how long I'll have to wait for the requested check to come."

I think everything was overpriced, but honestly, it's vegas - i get it. \nthe one thing that saved this restaurant was the blueberry poptarts. those actually tasted amazing. also, it didn't help that the service was horrible. from the hosts trying to find us seats (even though the whole place was practically empty) to finally getting a server to even get some water, it was overall a non pleasant visit."

I give 3 stars because it was deliciously average for Vegas- the burger capital of the world.\n\nI tried their Korean-esque burger.  I forget what it's called.  Cooked to perfect medium well burger-ness.  Sweet potato fries were crunchy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. Salted just enough to create an interesting flavor.\n\nAmbiance: Great for happy hour or a fun, Friday night dinner.  Rather loud for a business meeting.\n\nService: Excellent.  Our waitress was kind and attentive.  Typical Vegas standard.  Since moving here, I have to say that overall, Vegas definitely is a hospitality town."

With its bright contrasting colours Tom Urban stood out from the bright lights of Sin City.\n\nThis restaurant was clean, quick and great service. They were playing great music and good sports channels. It's the perfect setting for a great time.\n\nOur server Michael, may possibly be the best server of the year. He was patient and a great food advisor. He has recommended the eats and don't eats, which made of choosing from the elaborate menu so easy. It is very well appreciated when service attempts to give each and every individual the best experience at that establishment.\n\nMy choice of meal was the Korean BBQ burger. It a was mouthwatering, plentiful, delicious, and original. The burger was perfectly prepared with fresh toppings and a perfect height to width ratio. The meal comes with a side of garlic shoestring fries or sweet potato fries. This is a meal to grant a return visit. It's simply amazing.\n\nMy experience in this establishment is great and can only hope that more people can experience the same feeling I have. I'm saddened that it is not available in Toronto. However, first pits in Vegas in the future would be Toms Urban."

I like to play and stay every so often at the New York New York Hotel & Casino and have walked pass this place way too many times. Just recently I decided let's end the procrastination! I arrived the other night just in time for Happy Hour! Score! On top of that there was no wait and we were seated right away! Our server was Eddie (I think that's his name) for the evening. He was great! There is nothing more that I appreciate than an attentive and honest server. When you are able to provide your own personal favorites on the menu as well as let the dining customers know what's not so good you get plenty cool points with me. Since I've never been there were two items I inquired about one being the full rack of ribs and the other the lobster roll. Both of these were explained to be \"just ok\" for taste. My theory is if I am going to pay extremely crazy prices for food I better be getting something damn delicious and well above \"just ok\". I finally made my mind up to eventually order the BBQ Bacon Jalapeno Burger Double Down Style which means double the meat and cheese! Score! With a side of sweet potato fries? Yeah I was in there like swimwear! Mouth just watered after ordering. To kill the immediate hunger me and my partner in crime decided to order the Hummus dip off the happy hour menu! If you are a hummus lover please do yourself a favor and get this to start! You won't regret it! When the burgers came out they looked amazing! My plate was just everything I thought it would be. The second burger that was ordered was the \"Sin City\" with a side of the garlic fries. Now I had to dock them a star on the fries on that plate because they were ridiculous! Cold! And you could tell they've been sitting. They lost even more points because when we brought it to our server's attention he took the plate of fries and returned within maybe 2 minutes? We are no fools I know that chef or whoever was in the kitchen just put those same fries in the hot grease and returned them to us. You can tell the difference between a fresh batch of fries or what was reheated..  After everything I still wanted desert and opted for their signature cheesecake with some raspberry sauce and whipped cream. To-go though because the burger was huge! All in all this was a pretty good visit and really enjoyed the burgers. I've heard brunch is great so I will be back to see what that's all about soon!"

            "review": "Most of the restaurants had shut down for the night.  We came across Tom's Urban and scrambled in to satisfy some early AM cravings.  We sampled the carnitas taco trio, the pulled pork sandwich and garlic fries. Overall, the food was good, but not over the top.  \n\nOur server, Josh (sporting an aggressive undercut hairstyle), did a fine job.  He advised us the restaurant had only been open a couple of days.  When I mentioned I'd post one of the first Yelp reviews of the place, his eyes got a little buggy.  He asked what I would write and I told him I'd make sure to mention he did a great job of taking care of us.\n\nLike any new restaurant, I expect Tom's Urban is trying to find it's legs. This place has a great location and potential.  I'll give Tom's Urban 3 stars for the food and dining experience and 1 star for feeding me when I really needed some late night chow."

Good portions. So far they are still working out the kinks as with any new restaurant opening, but it should prove to be a go-to spot. This is their third location in 2 years so clearly they are doing something right. The menu is a mixed bag of twists on different ethnic dishes like burritos and potstickers with some good American standards with Tom's Urban flair as the base. I've only seen the day menu so far, but supposedly their breakfast plates are to die for. I'll be back."

Lots of tables, room for large parties. Large Tvs all over the place, would definitely return again. The lobster Mac and cheese is delicious."

            "review": "We arrived and sat on the patio. Our server took a few minutes to come to our table. They were pretty steady so we understood. He finally came over and we could tell right away how uninterested he was at doing his job. He was not friendly or welcoming at all. He took our drink and food order and thats about it. We received our food and he never checked on us or asked how everything was. We got finished with a couple of our plates and we sat them on the chair next to us because we didnt have room on the table. Our server walked by numerous times and failed to stop and pick them up. We even saw a manager that was standing right next to our table. He seemed more content socializing and hugging all over the hostesses instead of making sure things were ok and that our dirty dishes which at this point were attracting flies were removed. When the server would ask if we were ok it was just passing by not coming by the table. He finally dropped our check and when he finally ran our card and brought it back he didnt even thank us. Overall TERRIBLE service and terrible management."
