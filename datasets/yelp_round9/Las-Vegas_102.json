If felt like someone had brought the beach to Vegas.  Neat outdoor scene with views of the strip and really, really good food.  The bartender recommended both the Blue Cheese burger and the sweet potato fires, neither of which I would have ordered on my own.  Good to take a rec now and again, as these were both stomach achingly delicious.  Great food, service, views and even relatively cheap for Vegas.  I will definitely be back my next time through."

            "review": "Cool lunch spot on the strip for a casual and quick meal. Ordered the pickle fries to share, a big green salad, the famous cheese burger, and an orange whip cocktail. The food was average and not something that I would go out of my way to eat again. The fried pickles were good; something you'd only be able to get at a fair or carnival. My only complaint about the dish was that the pickle slice wouldn't hold to the breading, so I was left with a chunk of fried breading after each bite. The big green salad was fresh and light. The croutons on the salad were house made and also very fresh. I enjoyed the lightness and acidity of the avocado dressing. My dining partner ordered a cheeseburger which was great in terms of flavor and presentation, but not comparable to my favorite LA spots. The cocktail was refreshing and well made as well. \n\nThe service was average for being on the strip. Our waitress was sweet and made a few recommendations on our orders. The ambience was also nice because even though we were technically sitting indoors, the view of the strip and the openness felt like I was sitting in an outdoor setting. Overall, good place to grab lunch if in the area but otherwise not something super memorable."

The fries were definitely made to share (they come in a sizeable bowl), and they're handcut and delicious.  \n\nBoyfriend got the mushroom burger, and he liked it.  I had the california chicken sandwich, which was also yummy.  Just the right amount of avocado, and the chicken was cooked well (not overdone/dry).  But here's my question - why does avocado = california?\n\nAnd now it's a few hours later, and I totally want another bowl of those fries."

With that being said, it still was a pretty solid burger. Shared a burger with my wife and it was plenty. We also had a half and half order of the sweet potato fries and onion strings.

I promise. Any of their burgers are good. I usually get the bacon cheese burger, or the chicken sandwich with avocado. \n\nYeah the service can be a pain sometimes but let's be strategical people. Don't sit at the bar if you want food service; the bartender back there is awesome and is running her butt off behind that bar. Don't go during lunch and not expect to wait to sit down: You are at a restaurant right on the Strip outside of a Mall. \n\nI will continue to go back to Stripburger because at the end of the day the food and atmosphere are awesome."

I love sitting outdoors and people watching here, especially when the weather is nice, but they use heaters and misters in the cold and hot weather, respectively, to keep the climate comfortable.  Don't let the extreme weather keep you away!  \n\nThe burgers are fresh (seriously!!) and flavorful!  Even the plainest of burgers here will knock your socks off.  The garlic fries are to die for.  And, if you're not already thinking alcoholic beverage, then you should give the chocolate fudge milkshake a whirl.\n\nI can't say the service has ever been anything but average, but the burgers, fries, and the location make up for anything this restaurant lacks in the service department."

Thankfully, this place was open and on the way back so we wouldn't be subject to the lame options at our hotel. We got some food to-go, and though its neighboring restaurant Segundo was closed, we got to order off their menu, which was great because everyone wanted nacho fries. We also got a side of garlic parmesan fries that came from the Stripburger menu, to share. \n\nit didn't take terribly long to get our food, which was nice, and we waited to get back to the room before eating. It was kind of a bummer how small the nacho fries were for how much they cost (around $15). Also, we were all hungry so we ate, but we all agreed that the taste was mediocre. We know our nacho fries. The garlic parmesan fries were good though! \n\nTheir biggest draw is that they're open and in plain sight while walking the strip late at night. Other people seem to be raving about the dining-in experience and burgers, so maybe that is worth trying. But, it's not on our must-return list."

Not only are the burgers insanely yummy but so id everything else. \n\nIf you don't like spicy things they do also have cheesy fries. If you've read any of my reviews you'll know by now that I LOVE CHEESE! My heart goes out to you lactose intolerant people :(\n\nAnyways, last time I was here was when I was in town for CES2011 and our waitress was super nice. Now I''m not sure if the service was just slower that day or because I was about ready to eat the small child at the next table...could have been both, but I'm going with the latter. I managed to shovel down a burger and a bowl and a half of atomic fries...holy orgasm in my mouth. \n\nAfter coming here I pretty much always end up coming out looking 10 months pregnant but I will never regret it (thank you fast metabolism!) \n\nWould recommend this as a great lunch or late dinner burger joint..they also serve extra large drink sizes for alcoholic beverages so thats always a plus :)"

Every time I drove down Las Vegas Blvd, I noticed this wedged in the Las Vegas Fashion Mall.  Yelp reviewers had it at 4 stars so it was worth checking out.\n\nIt's all outdoor seating which is kind of brutal during the summer.  I went for dinner and the misters were helpful in keeping it cool, but they also kind of mist your plate, your drink and everything else.  The waitresses are nice and the food came out quick.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the burger was the bun.  It looked perfectly round and not too thick.  The burger was above average.  It was too dark to see the pinkness of the patty, but judging by taste and consistency, I'd say they got it right.  My cousin also ordered fried pickles.  I freaking hate pickles, but these were fried so crispy, I couldn't even taste the pickles.  Surprisingly good!\n\nWorth going to, but if you go on a hot summer day, you might suffer a little...\n\n\nWHAT I ORDERED:\nMain ---\nSpecial (burger, Jack Daniel sauce, cheddar, bacon): 4/5\n\nSides ---\nFries: 3/5\nFried Pickles: 4/5\n\nSTAFF:\nFriendly\n\nWAIT TIME:\nShort\n\nPORTION:\nAverage\n\nBANG FOR YOUR BUCK:\nJust about right for what you get.\n\nWOULD I RETURN:\nYes, but in fall or spring"

I ordered the Bison burger which comes with a creamy french cheese, I don't recall the name but it was a good match with the Bison.  I ordered medium rare, it came out more medium but still had a little pink and was not dry so I went with it.  Fries were really good and more than enough.  I think I would have preferred a slightly more upscale lettuce than iceberg on the burger but that is probably picking at nits and certainly will not keep me from going back!  Another very decent burger place in LV!"

Believe it or not they actually serve burgers, and if you are way too fragile  to handle a large helping of charred flesh ( as I was ) they do a mean chilli and some decent soups.\n\nThe service was good, but one thing I must report - they serve absolutely without question the worst bloody mary in the history of the world. Bland. Weak. Almost tastless. A shot of vodka and a splash of ketchup would be more invigorating than the pathetic excuse for a pick-me-up this otherwise fine establishment offers its hung-over patrons."

When I asked the waiter if the fries were supposed to be this texture, he actually said Yes (which I think is bull), but was happy to remove it from my bill so I appreciate the good customer service. If you're shopping at the Fashion Show Mall, I suggest you pick somewhere else to eat unless you don't mind wasting a meal in Vegas by eating food that will bore you to bits."

My aunt got a strawberry shake which was filled with bits of strawberry chunks on the bottom and it was amazing.  I got the Cookie and Cream it was topped with oreo's filled with oreo's throughout the vanilla shake and more on the bottom.  It was smooth and creamy and the big thick straw made it perfect to drink from.  It was a great meal and I will definitely be back.  I highly recommend this restaurant!!"

In n out was just not close enough so we decided to try stripburger.\n\nWe both commented that it's a great location, even though it's a bit hard to find. Like another reviewer said, great spot to people watch.\n\nOnce we we sat and ordered, it went down hill...fast...from there. We order two burgers and shared the fries. The fries come in a basket with plenty for two people. Sadly, they were cold, however, they had a lot of potential. If they were hot, these fries could rival in n outs fries. But we will never know. Read on...\n\nThe burgers came after a longer than average wait ( this place was not busy) we ordered our burgers medium. Sadly, they came nearly raw. Intact, I think I heard mine moo a few times. The waitress finally came back and we explained to her the burgers were just not cooked enough. They were red not pink inside. She was very kind and offered to have them cook new burgers for us. We took her up on the offer and the fresh burgers arrive...with cold buns. Not good.\n\nAs far as flavor goes, I had a simple cheeseburger. It was as boring as it sounds. Not much flavor, just a dab of cheese and hardly any onions.\n\nThe other burger was the Brie and bacon, I think. Again, a cold bun and not a lot of flavor.\n\nOther than the long delay of service at the beginning and end, the service was just ok. I was very pleased that the manager came out and asked us about the raw burgers. I was not expecting him to do anything about it, and he didn't. But it was nice of him to ask us about the situation.\n\nIn the future, when we seek a \"gourmet burger\" we will go to Holsteins."

There was enough blue cheese that you could tell that it was present, but not overpower the rest of toppings and the juicy burger patty. I'm glad I didn't order fries because I was stuffed after the burger and shake, but they did look good! The service was great and the servers were definitely on the ball delivering food, getting/refilling drinks, and were very friendly!

Everyone agreed- their hamburger was amazing!! \n\nThis is the perfect place to come if you have been drinking at the tables all day and have a little buzz on so don't really want to spend the money or time at a fancy dinner."

Our entire party of six thought our variety of burgers were excellent. \n\nOne of our party wasn't feeling well and wanted to stay at the hotel but we wanted non hotel food so we did a pickup order. When we got back to our hotel we realized we were missing the burger for the one not feeling well. Called the restaurant and talked with the manager named Mark how dealt with it immediately. He apologized profusely and had one made up for me to pickup as soon as I could return. He also threw in another order of fries, and two shakes for free just for our trouble."

But when it comes to cocktail dresses for $9, I finally give in.  After spending several tedious hours trying on clothes, I need nourishment before heading to work.  In a moment of weakness, I stroll through the food court, but who am I kidding?  I hate food courts and even in a nicer mall like the Fashion Show, the outlets all offer the same junk.\nSo now I am torn between Maggiano's and Stripburger.  After browsing both menus, I choose the latter.  It is a gorgeous day and Stripburger has all outdoor seating right on the strip.\nAll of their burgers are $8.95-$9.95.  The fries are not included.  The drink menu looks tempting, but like I said, I am headed to work soon, so I settle for something from the Lake Mead region.\nMy burger comes in less than 15 minutes and is cooked exactly as ordered.  The accompaniments (roll, tomato, etc.) are all fresh and this is a very good burger.  \nWould I make a trip to the strip just to eat here?  Probably not.  But I would definitely come back should I be caught hungry in that area again and maybe next time I can sample some of their adult beverages."

We were greeted and asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. I was shocked that they had an inside! I thought the whole restaurant was the circle you see from the strip. We sat inside because it was chilly outside and the bar was full and very loud. \n\nOur waitress was super friendly. She even suggested that we not order fries and onion rings (because we were going to) because the portions are so large. I like when a waitress is honest and looks out for her customers. She was right! The fries are a large portion and enough to share. I ordered the BBQ burger and it was delicious. Overall, a great burger place!!"

We were there for my wedding reception and i had confirmed the reservation  just 2 days prior, however, when we showed up everyone looked very confused. Then we waited past our reservation time to be seated. This was not a great start. They were clesrly understaffed because we asked to have drinks and champagne brought first so we cpuld do our toaats before dinner and we got our food before we got our champagne. I also ordered pickle fries as an add on to the customary group package and they vever came until after we were half way done with our meals. \nWe did speak with the manager while there and service did improve but it started off a little upsetting, especially the confused looks upon arrival.

I ended up eating here like 5 times over the course of 6 or 7 days. If I am not going to ball it up at a michelin star place, its pretty tough to beat strip burger. \n\nIt has a great location- right outside Fashion Show on the corner with the Wynn- good for people watching and sitting outside. \n\nA few notes on the food\n\nSweet potato fries- amazing. They come dusted with a large grain sugar which is good in and of itself, but they also come with FRY SAUCE. For those of you who don't know, fry sauce is a mixture of BBQ sauce and manaise (or aoli) and is delicious. The fry sauce at SB is 10/10 and on the sweet potato fries is incredible. Other than the SP fries at Burgr (that come with a can of vanilla powdered sugar) there is nothing even close in Vegas that can compete with SB.\n\nThe Shakes- are VERY thick like a shake could be. Very good. But here is the little detail that pushes them over the edge into super amazing- I always get oreo shakes and at SB they give you a straw that is about 3x as wide as a regular straw so it never clogs with cookie pieces/you can just suck them right up. I have since seen this other places but when I first went to SB 8 years ago I was super impressed with this obviously simple innovation.\n\n\nGuac- is very good. I assume it comes from El Segundo Sol (the mexican restaurant right next to SB that is owned by the same group but SUUUUUUCKS) and it is very good. \n\nChicken wings- these are often on special as an appetizer and are very good for a non dedicated wing place. \n\nThe Burgers\n\nI generally get the southwest burger as my go to- it is awesome. The meat is always cooked right- never over cooked.  Other burgers I have enjoyed are the occasional \"little kid\" burger they have on special- it comes with like velveeta cheese on top etc. as you used to eat as a kid. The blue cheese burger is also pretty good. The Tuna burger has been a favorite of people I have been there with if you aren't into beef."

Got a bunch of apps and a few different burgers were ordered. Great alternative to the high end dining we did the rest of the week. If a cold beer and burger is what you want this is the place. Short walk across the street from the Wynn."

I just couldn't get over the fact that everything i was about to touch would contaminate my hands before i even get to my burgers.  In result we order a bottle water and drank straight out the bottle.  It was served warm. \n\nI was in a mood for a nice burger and been wanting to try this place for some time now.  My gf and i shared Bacon Cheddar, their signature Blue Cheese Burger, and a Threesome (onions strings, fries, and pickle fries).\n\nOur food took 22min to arrive.  When it did my gf thought our burgers were cold. And I thought for a 'signature' burger they would do something special with the blue cheese, but it was a burger with blue cheese crumbles.  My Bacon Cheddar was OK.  You have to be an idiot to mess up bacon.\n\nOur fries also came out poorly compare to McDonald's standard.  I expected more from a establishment on the strip but this wasn't the case.  There were a mixture of greasy limp, burnt, and legitimate fries in our basket along with onion strings and deep fried pickles.  I shouldn't have to go through 5 of fries to get to1 edible potato piece.\n\nOverall we were very, very disappointed in this place.  Nice Location, but DON'T fall this tourist trap.  I bet you can get a decent burger at a cafe or even Denny's if you're in a mood for one.  We went to InO the next night to get our burger fix."

The fries are super crispy and blazing hot. Be careful when popping them in your mouth. My tongue is still numb. My only complaint is that they use American cheese (Kraft singles style) and sprinkled with cheddar. The strong processed cheese taste was overwhelming.\n\nOnce happy hour hit, another Sierra Nevada went down to 2 dollars and two sliders were only 5. The beef patties were super juicy and the dressing was simple. They came with chopped lettuce, diced tomatoes and onions with a thousand island dressing on an egg bun. For our pre and post happy hour order, our bill came out to be twenty dollars and change. \n\nAll the seating is outside, but with the misters, it was comfortable. The bar is the place to sit. Our bartender was attentive, but left us alone. That is the best service I could ask for."

We asked to be seated indoors and it was clean so no complaints there. Our server was very attentive and made sure to answer any questions we had about the menu. She also told us about some of the specials not listed on the menu, all which sounded tasty.\n\nThe food was delicious. My burger was cooked exactly as I asked and quite filling. All in all, a solid, well cooked and seasoned burger. The one thing that I really recommend is the garlic and herb fries. They were the stars of the entire meal. Of course, my breath was kicking after, but it was definitely worth it because they were that good. The sweet potato fries were also pretty nom. A word of advice, if you do want a side, split it with a friend, it's a lot for one person.\n\nIf you are in the mood for a burger, and not a fast food burger, try this place. It's a hidden gem in the mall."

Its a pretty small restaurant and actually looks like a patio of another restaurant. The seating is all outdoors under a series of tents so make sure the weather is nice. Turns out the restaurant actually shares a kitchen with a neighboring Mexican restaurant (El Segundo Sol), along with bathrooms and some waitstaff.\n\nFor the most part, the menu is similar to other 'fancy burger' places. Each burger runs around $10-12 bucks. The traditional cheeseburgers or whatever are cheaper and their 'specialty' ones are more expensive.... An assortment of fries each around $4-8, and of course alcoholic milkshakes.\n\nI tries to the KBBQ burger which just seemed like a regular patty with some Kalbi sauce on it. Pretty average. The atomic fries are regular fries layer with Velveeta cheese and jalapenos. The food here isn't bad, its just not that good. If you want a good burger check our Holsteins or Burger Bar way better."

After the long trek to get over to the area, we were seated super fast in the bar area outside. Our waitress was really nice despite how busy they were. She kept filling our glasses with ice cold water - we were all thirsty and HOT!!! My boyfriend and I ordered the veggie burgers, and his aunt ordered the green chile burger. We shared a \"threesome\". The order came extremely fast. I fell in love with my veggie  burger at first bite. If you are vegetarian and need something good - this is it. It is $9 and HUGE. If I wasn't starving I would have only been able to eat half. My boyfriend still got a 1/5th portion of mine that was left over. It was truly fantastic. \n\nThe threesome was delicious too. The onion strings (which I cleverly placed on my burger) were yummy. The fries were so-so but not awful, and the PICKLE fries were SO good that we ordered a single serving of them. They were surprisingly delicious and worth trying. I recommend getting the threesome if you are with a group so if you like them, you can always order more! \n\nWe had a restaurant.com $10 cert so our order came to $30 after that deduction. The staff was really attentive despite the busy night. The Aunt was afraid of her medium burger and the chef was extremely sweet about it and offered her a new one if she didn't feel comfortable eating it. \n\nOverall, a great experience. I just HATE how hard it is to get there and back to your car on a late night."

We all want ranch sauce, but we haven't had our waitress come by since we ordered. \n\n3:40ish\n\nStill no sign of our waitress or my shake. I finally have to ask for ranch from a server. My food is pretty good. My wife's salad however, has sand in it. She's disgusted. I ask to speak with the a supervisor, since I've been starting to get pissed off with this whole experience. He comes out, sees us, yet incredulously decides it's more important to talk to his friends, who are seated at a nearby table, about what they're doing today/tonight. He finally comes over to our table and I explain that her salad has sand in it. He insincerely apologizes and leaves with the salad. \n\n3:50p.m. \n\nFed up with the whole not being served, I FIND my waitress who's hidden down by the bar. Before I can even say anything to her, she blurts \"my manager is taking care of everything.\" WTF! All I wanted to tell her is that I don't want either the shake that I have yet to receive or the sand salad remake. \n\n3:52p.m. \n\nThe manager comes out with both my shake and my wife's salad. I tell him to take them off our bill and that we didn't want them. He tried to tell us that it wasn't sand, it was finely ground pepper. BULLSHIT! I think my wife can tell the difference. Does pepper grind in your teeth like eating a sandwich when you're at the beach? NO!\n\n4:06p.m. \n\nOur waitress decides she wants to give us our bill. I pay and tip a red cent. Worst service ever! From the top down, it's very unprofessional. I hate complaining, but seriously, it took over an hour just to see our waitress again and I was the one who had to hunt her down. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go elsewhere.

Given the hour, everything was either closed or they wanted the deed to my house for a meal. That's when we found strip burger!\n\nThe prices here were very economical, happy hour was an option but we chose to order off the regular menu. Got us some chili cheese fries and a drink all for under $5, which is absolutely amazing for a decent restaurant right on the strip. \n\nWhat did bother me about this place was the service. Not only were the waiting staff completely disinterested in their job, but even after we got the attention of a waiter, our food took 20 minutes to come out. So we waiting 15 minutes for someone to take our order, 20 minutes to get the food and then another 10 to get the check. Mind you, this was at 2 in the morning and we were one of maybe 3 tables that were being served at the time!"

My initial thought about this place was that it basically exists because of it's location and not because the food is great.  However, my burger, a cheddar and mushroom, cooked perfectly medium rare, was a piece of deliciousness and really satisfied my burger craving.  If you're looking for a decent priced meal, mine was $9.95, and/or craving a burger I'd recommend this place.\n\nAlso, from 9:00 PM on they were doing select beers and well drinks for $2.  I'm not a fan so much of that as I'm a scotch girl myself, but for those looking to save some bucks and have a few, it's good to know."

The menu was interesting, but by no means the most innovative that I have seen. I was talked into the Brie and bacon burger by my awesome bartender, Amy. I ordered the burger medium rare with the egg over easy.  The burger was way over done, but Amy took care if me and sent it back. The second attempt was less well-done, but still not anything close to medium rare (and the egg was definitely NOT over easy).  I do not send food back twice. Overall the food experience was well below average, but Amy made a legitimate attempt to provide me with the best service possible. If not for her, I would never return."

Anyways, we were hungry for some lunch considering we were hungover from a Bellagio buffet dinner the day prior.  We had a yard from Fresh but sadly we couldn't take it in with us so we were forced to take out food.  We ordered a BBQ Chicken Sandwich.  It cost about $10 which is pretty steep for just a sandwich/burger.  It was good, but not $10 good.  Good crisp and spice, but just way too expensive.  Kind of glad we took it out so we were able to drink our yard while we ate the food in the food court on the third level of the Fashion Mall."

Not good.\nThe beef in the burgers is excellent. The patties are high quality, with the perfect amount of fat and cooked to perfection.\nThey have nice buns. They're fresh and delcious and just bready enough to hold up to the toppings and burger juices.\nThe condiments are fresh and delicious.\nI had the burger topped with mac and cheese and bacon. The bacon is meh, maybe worse than that. It's just your basic thin-sliced store bought variety and isn't cooked to a crisp (read: limp). The mac and cheese was decent, but nothing more. It didn't have much flavor or cheesiness.\nI've had much better burgers, at much lower prices, at a whole bunch of other places. If Stripburger wants to survive in this super competitive market, they'd better step up their game."

Our friend had a blue cheese burger that she enjoyed very much but since I did not taste it, I will not review it.\n\nI had ordered the cheese fries and the cheese did not look so good. Once I tasted it, I realized it was not real cheese. It tasted very rubbery and fake, almost like cheap nacho cheese from a dispenser. I ate most of it because I was buzzing pretty good and needed something to eat. I was not impresed with the meal.\n\nI also split mini sliders with my girlfriend and they as well weren't all that great.  We looked at the sliders and they had a disproportionate amount of bread to burger size. The mini slider was very narrow thrown on in the middle of a big bun of sorts that was big for a slider size. It made eating the slider somewhat difficult. Overall, not impressed.\n\nLastly, a drunk pirate with his bird made me pose in a picture with him outside the restaurant. Not only did his bird shit on my arm, he of course spilled his beer on me as well. He was kind enough to wipe the crap of my arm with his jacket and wash my arm with beer. Nice guy...."

After calling a dozen restaurants in Las Vegas we finally found this place which was open till midnight, thankfully. We arrived at 8pm with a party of 3 and we were seated immediately.\n\nOur server was terrible to put it politely. Took her ~8mins to come introduce herself to our table. Also we had to steal utensils from the table across from us because she only brought enough for two people. Not sure if she was just having a bad day but she came across as very uninterested, hurried, and unhospitable. \n\nI ordered the Buffalo Chicken Burger and it was served on a small appetizer plate. The burger had an artificial taste to it, the breaking on the patty was also very soggy halfway through the burger. Also what disappointed me the most was the bread! My burger was so soggy that the bottom half of my bun was thinner than a pancake, literally.\n\nI argued with my cousins for about 5 minutes complaining how I didn't get a bottom bun to my burger, but sure enough once I began eating it was under all of the excess ingredients in my plate. My cousins thought it was a tomato at first, lol. (See picture for my pancake bun) \n\nOverall, I would give this place 2 stars. Service: 2/5, Food Quality: 2/5, Atmosphere: 3/5\n\nTip: Probably the cheapest meal on the strip you will find... 3 of us ordered burgers and the tab was $35."

At the North East corner of the Fashion Show Mall on Las Vegas Blvd. - it's across the street from the Wynn and Encore so there's a ton of foot traffic. No matter where you sit (it's all patio seating) you'll have a great view of Las Vegas's best!\n\nThis burger joint has become of favorite of ours when we're down on the strip because the food is good, the pricing is fair and the people watching is phenomenal! \n\nWe love to use restaurant.com and this happens to be a newer addition to that site that sells out rather quickly each month. The nice thing is they restock the gift certificates at the beginning of each month so if you're on top of it you can snag one. They have both $10 and $25 gift certificates available. We purchased a $25 one.\n\nWe came down to the strip specifically to eat here. We parked just off the strip at Nordstroms and discovered that was quite a walk, however we discovered there's a parking lot for the mall right behind the restaurant so that will be good to know for next time.\n\nThere are so many tasty options here. My boyfriend ordered the Hickory Chicken Sandwich - $9.95, which was awesome! I ordered the Mini Burger Sampler which came with 3 sliders - the Blue Cheese Burger, The Jack Daniels Hickory Bacon Burger, and the Cheddar Burger - $10.95. All were tasty and I added bacon to each of them (for my boyfriends sake, since we end up sharing everything). As an appetizer we LOVE the fried pickles so we ordered the 'Threesome' as we usually do - a basket of Onion Rings, Fries & Pickle Fries - $6.95. This comes with a spicy dipping sauce similar to a spicy ranch, we also asked for a side of cheese sauce for the fries - it's like a melted cheese you'd put on nachos with green and red peppers in it. YUM!\n\nSince we weren't worried about calories (this meal was all about taste), we also ordered a Fat Tire pint of beer - $5.75 and a Banana Milk Shake (heavenly)-  $4.95. We didn't come close to finishing even half of our food but wow was it good! We'll be back soon.\n\n**Side note: they have Happy Hour daily in the bar area from 4-7pm and 11pm - close. $2 Coors Light, PBR & Bud Light drafts.**"

I gather she was figuring out what to do with life, not sure, but she reappeared about 5 minutes later and asked about drinks and our order shortly thereafter. I don't expect to be seated and asked what we want to order and drink immediately, but there is something to be said about a server that shows up to a table within 1 minute of you being seated, especially since she was the one that sat us. I must admit the service has been consistently lacking lately, even the food has been coming out a little tardy. Not sure what the issue is, but they need to get it together.\n\nAnyway, the Mexican burger was juicy and the garlic herb fries were good."

The lady at the bar barely acknowledged my presence and didn't even bother to ask me details about my order. I got the cheeseburger and she didn't even ask what kind of cheese I wanted. Also the entire time I sat there (10 to 15 min) she never even asked if I wanted a drink, even water. Her customer service was so bad that I was really turned off from this place, but the other servers who were greeting customers who wanted a table all seemed really friendly so I can't say it's everybody who works there. \n\nOf course then I had the food and I was really pleased. The cheeseburger was great. Nice  and juicy with your typical toppings. Even eating it after walking back to my hotel in the cold, it tasted great. I didn't get the fries, which seem to have mixed reviews, but I did get the chocolate shake, which was also really good. The only other downside is that this place is pretty expensive. $11 for a cheeseburger and $6 for a shake. But I guess for Vegas located right off the strip, it's decent. I'd come back here again, I just hope I'd get better customer service."

Unfortunately, STRIPBURGER is not one of them.  \n\nI ordered a beer, burger and fries as I sat at the bar.  The food was fine.  Not terrible.  Not phenomenal.  I would say acceptable. A little pricey, but everything on the LV strip tends to be a bit higher priced so no major surprises there.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the bartender gives my bill.   I submit my $15 off a $30 purchase coupon to her.  She rings the transaction on the cash register, I pay and she gives me my receipt. Right before I left, I told the bartender I would be back for another beer after I did some shopping in the adjoining mall.  \n\nOne hour later, I returned. I sat at the bar again with the same bartender.  I ordered another beer.  The price is $11.00 plus tax.  I lay my $10.00 off any purchase coupon on the bar along with two single $1.00 bills.  In Las Vegas, NV the state sales tax equals 8.1% of your total purchase price.  On an $11.00 purchase, the sales tax equals approximately .89 cents.  So the total of my beer should be $11.89.  This is where things start getting dicey. \n\nThe bartender picks up my two single dollar bills along with my $10.00 coupon.  She immediately places the two $1.00 bills in her tip bucket.  She then proceeds to lay my $10.00 coupon on the top of her till drawer on the cash register and she completely fails to ring my beer purchase on the cash register.  I get no change and no receipt.  Meanwhile, the bartender has three separate girlfriends who visit her, on three separate occasions during my visit.  The bartender seems to be more interested in jawboning with her girlfriends then paying attention to doing her job and taking bar orders.  At one point, a gentleman on the other side of the bar actually yells ''Excuse me Miss, may I order a drink''.\n\nBy this point, I decide I am going to speak to the Manager about what I just witnessed in regards to the bartender failing to ring my transaction, return my change and provide me with a receipt.  I go into the restaurant and find the Manager named Scott.  I relate to him exactly what I have outlined here, and I describe in exact detail what the bartender did.  This Manager Scott, and I utilize that term loosely in this context, because Scott certainly did not behave like a Manager.  After I explain what I witnessed, he looks at me with this blank stare and says, ''I will go and get you your change right now''.  I explain to him, ''It's not about my .11 cents, It's about the principal of the matter.  Are you at all concerned that your bartender is taking cash that belongs in your cash register drawer and putting it in her tip bucket and failing to properly ring transactions?''  Scott immediately becomes defensive and very rude and states, ''Maybe she thought it was a tip.  Look, I don't understand what you are complaining about.  I offered to get your change and you refused.  I will have a conversation with her and that conversation is none of your business''.  I reply ''May I ask you a question, how come I did not receive a receipt for my beer purchase?''  Scott replies, ''It's our policy to only issue a receipt when requested to do so''.  \nI reply....''WRONG!  I received a receipt 1 hour before from the same bartender for my lunch purchase, AND I DID NOT REQUEST IT!  So what is your receipt policy Scott?''  By this time Scott is becoming visibly agitated with me and again, in a very rude and condescending manner, ''Look I told you I would speak with her about it and you already said you don't want your change so what else is there to talk about.  At that point, I state, ''you know what, I'm done speaking with you, have a nice day\".  So I proceed to finish my beer and prepare to leave.  I glance down at the end of the bar and I notice manager Scott speaking to a well-dressed gentleman who just entered the restaurant, and I see Scott motion over to me, as if he is relating my story to this other gentleman.  \n\nNext thing I know, this man comes up to me and Scott introduces him as Mr. Ross B, Vice president & Managing partner of the restaurant.  I'm naming this gentleman, because he requested that I do so when I told him he could read my review on YELP.    Mr. B. goes on to state that Scott told him about my experience.  A this point I inform Mr. B that Scott is very rude and spoke to me in a very condescending and unwelcomed tone of voice.  I went on to say that I was more than happy to speak with him, but I was done conversing with Scott and he could exit our conversation.  Scott leaves and goes back to work.  Mr. B. goes on to state that he had never known Scott to be rude.  I told him that he would probably be amazed at some of the behavior of his employees when he was not present at his restaurant.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT LIKE THE PLAGUE!"

Or a milkshake, which I haven't had since 1983 (so how come I'm not skinny?)   I would have preferred a Riesling, and even would have settled for a lowly white zinfandel.  Ix-nay on either.  Strike One for my first visit here.\n\nSo I won't drink, and I'll have coffee instead.  \"Yes, it's fresh,\" the waitress answered.  \"Ah, but do you have milk for it.\"  \"No, just cream.\" (See 1983 above). Strike Two.\n\nStrike Three came close to happening.  I ordered the mushroom and cheddar burger with a salad on the side.  I was about to throw in the towel after the waitress said the dressing was a lemon vinaigrette, which I'd love to love, but most vinaigrettes are too tangy for my delicate Princess mouth.  She saved the day by offering to let me have ranch, and I got the feeling she was doing me a favor because of the first two strikes.  Oh, she was very pleasant about it, but I just sensed this wasn't in the script.\n\nThe burger was excellent, but almost rare, instead of the medium I ordered.  I like rare hamburgers, but the Food Police tell me not to eat them.  It didn't have a lot of the cheddar, which was fine with me, and the mushrooms were fresh and plentiful.  My husband had the same thing, and enjoyed his.  One friend ordered the turkey burger, and the other had the ahi tuna.  They loved them both.  We also shared a basket of the sweet potato fries, not usually high on my list, but these were delicious and not greasy or oversalted.\n\nWould I go back?  Probably, as long as I remember to bring my hip flask."

They all loved the selection of pipe-in club hits and the overall atmosphere. \nFoodwise, since I'm not a heavy eater, I usually opt for the 3 mini-burgers medium well with a side of their sampler (onion curls, fries and pickes) It doesn't sound a lot but it gets its job done and I always leave the place stuffed. Their shakes aren't bad, they aren't great either. The menu says you could add about $2 for a shot of alcohol so if you're feeling a lil' adventurous, you could try it. Burger quality can be compared to In-N-Out so if you do visit the place, try getting something different like the mexican burger per say or their vegan choices which my friends said weren't bad."

BUT I SURE AS HELL GOING TO TRY....\n\nTonight we decided to have a family outing of shopping and dinner at Fashion Show Mall, however, what started out as a great time quickly turned into an amazingly bad experience thanks of course to the HORRIFYINGLY BAD service at Strip Burger.\n\nFirst off, it took your hostess 15 minutes to have us seated at a table, BUT THERE WERE EMPTY TABLES EVERYWHERE WE LOOKED!!!  It took her so long to come back to us that we contemplated on just getting a To-Go order, BUT (TO NO) SURPRISE, THERE WASN'T ANYONE THERE TO EVEN HELP US PUT IN AN ORDER!.\n\nLuckily (or not), this \"hostess\" finally finds a table (again.... EMPTY TABLES EVERYWHERE) for us to sit in and a server takes our order.  Now, I ordered the new Velveeta Burger which had a simple ingredients - Burger with Velveeta with onion strings and Russian dressing.  Simple enough right?  But I got what looked like a regular burger with Russian dressing - NO ONION STRINGS.  NOW.... before you say I overreacted and should have just sent it back.... I say, \"I WOULD HAVE SENT IT BACK HAD THEY ACTUALLY COME BACK TO CHECK IF EVERYTHING.... OR ANYTHING WAS OKAY!\"... but she never came back... not for anything.. not even to check to see if we needed a napkin...\n\nMind you, I was trying to be calm about this (pardon my language) whole fucking situation, but what sent me over the edge was that, my family had finished their dinner (I was just too pissed to eat) and we waited patiently for our server to come back because we wanted to place an order to-go for my little brother that was studying at home for his midterms.... we waited.......and waited.... and waited.... AND WAITED.... until I had enough and had to go hunt her ass down to tell her I wanted to place a to-go order and the check!\n\nAND THEN WE WAITED.... only to be sent a different server to take our order (MAYBE OUR ORIGINAL WAITRESS WAS SCARED -- AND WITH GOOD REASON!)\n\nI have never had an issue with this place before.... in fact, I loved coming here with friends and our past experiences here had been awesome... But truth be told, I'm just over it now -- I don't think I will be coming back here any time soon.... or bringing people here to dine any time soon....\n\nYour service at Strip Burger was impeccably bad that I would have rather gone through a Burger King drive-thru .... At least I would have gotten my food as well as my check in a timely and less frustrating manner than what your SORRY EXCUSE for a wait-staff you had tonight had given us!  If I ever do come back here, I will definitely make sure that I come when your A-squad is working and not your D-squad... although, why should I take the chance again?  It was truly insufferable.\n\nI do hope you enjoyed the note that I wrote at the bottom of the check.  PLEASE.... DO reflect on that message.... and YES... I did spell out the gratuity for you in perfect English -- Z-E-R-O."

AKA the quintessential Vegas night/experience/story/whatever. \n\nAs a caveat, whenever I tell people about stripburger they always give me a kind of confused look. I mean, it being Vegas and all, anything goes, right? So I'm assuming that they're assuming that Stripburger is probably a strip club where you can get burgers? That sounds kind of amusing, but I don't know how I'd really feel about enjoying a nice meaty burger while simultaneously enjoying nice meaty stripper buns in my face or what have you. Cool concept though, so I'll put that on my to-do list when I have a gondola load of money. \n\nAnyway, the strip in stripburger refers to the fact that it's on the Strip. Though, there is a stripper/strip club story in this story, I may not go into detail about it because this is yelp and y'all could be my grandmothers or my grocery bagger or something. \n\nSo the gist of the story is that I came out to Vegas for training for a week. One of my coworkers is also in town though it's for a different training seminar. On this particular day though, I couldn't find him so I'm basically moderately alone in Vegas (though one can argue you're never alone in Vegas or you're ALWAYS alone in Vegas) and I don't know enough about Vegas to know where to go/what to do. I ain't a gambler and I usually just follow my friends around like a sheep. There are other facets of sin that I can get into, but again, you're probably my rabbi.\n\nI wander for an hour up and down the strip and I end up at stripburger even though it's about 7 minutes away from my Hotel (this was based on the recommendation of my shuttle driver btw). So I come figuring I'll sit at the bar, eat a burger, drink a White Russian and relax in Vegas. \n\nThe bartender girl was very nice. The drinks she gave me were pretty cheap and she was somewhat talkative. I ordered chili cheese fries and some sort of burger with bacon. I actually don't even remember what it was right now and it was only a little over two weeks ago! Everything was good, especially since it was on the Company. \n\nLong story short after maybe sitting for 15 minutes, 2 dudes around my age sit next to me and I strike up a conversation with them. End up going out on the town with them and it leads to a very surreal night. S'all I can really say. So shouts out to them I suppose and of course, to Vegas."

I love anything with bacon, but this was a step above the rest. Would definitely recommend it to out of town guests staying at that end of the strip."

But low and behold, they don't have wheat buns.  They don't have WHEAT BUNS!?!????  You're a burger place and you don't have wheat buns?  Ok...  You serve \"healthier\" options like turkey, veggie, and even ahi tuna burgers, but NO WHEAT BUNS?  You guys aren't so bright.  Especially being so close to California, how do you not have wheat buns.\n\nOk, so whatever.  I get over it and order a salad.. The Veggie Salad.  So my salad had these shabby pieces of yellow lettuce (except for the one piece of wilted green lettuce) and like three pieces of chicken (which I paid extra for to add) on.  The \"vinaigrette\" was nothing but salted oil.  Burnt and soggy vegetables.  Basically it was just a horrible experience.. ESPECIALLY for being on the \"Strip\".  I would never eat here again.  Not even for free."

The food was pretty good too!\n\nMe and a buddy came here for the burgers first and foremost, but they have promotions frequently and I got one just a week before I was coming into town for a free milkshake with any purchase! That sold us along with the many positive reviews. \n\nWe ordered the mini burger sampler and the cookies n cr\u00e8me milkshake. The milkshake was the standout of the two for sure! Chunks of oreo in every bite. Usually in my experience you have to fish for the chunks, but in ours it was more than plentiful just the way we like it. The burgers weren't bad either, but since they were mini, it was probably difficult to cook these medium rare as we requested. They were still flavorful, and I would def recommend anyone to come here and try it for themselves at least for their shakes!"

We got two burgers, garlic fries, and a chocolate shake. The garlic fries were a bit much, but doable. The chocolate shake was delicious, I slurped it all before our food came out! Our burgers came out faster than ever and they were cooked correctly and superb. I added an egg to mine for that extra taste and it was just heavenly. Take your friends here so you can walk the mall or strip right afterwards. I was able to come in and go to work, so they are really good on time! Definitely a fan and will be coming back to try other things."

But, my friend works for Apple at Fashion Show so our gracious waiter gave us 20% off discount which brought our bill to $24 combined. This was reasonable price to pay for a delicious sandwich with a beer and fries on the strip. Our server was very nice, but the hostess and the bartender looked bored and snobby. Yawn. Also, be prepared for the OBNOXIOUS drunk foreign tourists. All in all not a bad place to grab a delicious burger and a beer and people watch."

I should have gone with the hickory burger b/c everyone else at the table loved theirs.

We arrived 11pm and now that I think about it maybe we shouldn't have came so close to closing because our burgers didn't taste that great or fresh..\n\nAtomic fries - pretty plain tasting\nGarlic Herb & Sweet potato fries - BOMB! this is what made me decide to give 3 stars instead of 2. The garlic fries were really fresh with garlic pieces and seasoning was spot on! Sweet potato fries were addicting as well. I ended up eating more of the fries than the burger\n\nBlue Cheese Burger - My friend ordered this and said it was just ok, nothing amazing.\nMushroom Cheddar Burger - My friend said she didn't like it. The buns soaked up all the juices and so it was falling apart.\nHickory Bacon Burger - I asked for mushrooms to be added to this burger and they forgot the mushrooms. In the end I was charged for the mushrooms, but told the waitress I didn't even get mushrooms in my burger and she fixed the bill. This burger was pretty bland, the only thing that made it taste good was probably the bbq sauce & caramelized onions.\n\nOverall, it took a LONG time for our burgers to be served and the patties for all 3 burgers were cold. Not even warm! Debating if I should give this place another shot next time during lunch time since maybe they were about to close and so they did a sloppy job? These burgers were pretty plain, should have spent my money at Bachi Burger or Holstein's instead."

It was almost like some divine entity was stopping me from coming here. The last time I tried to come here was in September 2010. I was in my car about to get into the parking building of the mall that  \"Stripbuger\" is located in when I got a telephone call. Apparently some guy who I barely knew from college put me down as one of his emergency contacts at work. I was told that they found him at \"Terrible's Casino\" laying on the floor and incoherently screaming and ranting before they decided to call the ambulance. That's his just-reward for going to college...a job at Terrbile's casino.\n\nGetting back to subject. \"Stripburger\" was just as good as I anticipated. A lot of the people in Summerlin say that LBS at the Redrock is the best sit-down burger joint in town, but I gotta disagree. \"Stripburger\" is far superior to Redrock and has a million times better service.\n\nI really like the fries here. They taste like they were pan fried with moderate amount of oil, instead of thrown into a giant deep fryer. They also intentionally slightly overcook the fries in order to achieve that really crispy texture. I greatly enjoy that style of the classic french fry. \n\nI got the Blue Cheese Burger. It was excellent. They put a practical joke amount of blue cheese in it. The meat is super fresh and not frozen, and the bun is one of those high quality sponge bread buns like what they got at In-n-out. \n\nThe service was the best part. Our server was a man from Arkansas who was very charismatic and hardworking. I left him a very big tip on account of his great customer service. The host girl was very flirty and tremendously attractive. She was so distracting that I kept spilling my drink. \n\nI guess my only complaint is that the seats are all metal and slightly uncomfortable, and you gotta go deep into the Mexican restaurant next door to use the restroom. Besides for that I gotta give this place a 5."

The alcoholic drinks sounded awesome, but being the good corporate citizen that I am, I had to pass *for this time*. \n\nI tried the sliders and tried Keith's suggestion of putting the yummy onion strings on them. They were pretty decent sliders.. they came with all the veggies on them (tomatoes, pickles, onions, lettuce), which is actually pretty rare for sliders! The aforementioned onion strings came in a 5.95 basket of fries and onion strings.. yum, I love having the best of both worlds!\n\nFiance was happy with his burger with jack cheese (although commented the 1 leaf of lettuce was kind of sad), and we both loved the butterscotch shake we split. \n\nService was just ok. There was some mild confusion due to the lack of hostess initially, and our guy was hard to track down when we wanted a refill on a soft drink. Overall a nice visit and I would go back.. especially with the great weather and I'd love to try the happy hour."

The $2 draft only applies to Coor or Bud light. We happened to have a coupon for free appetizer with one entree purchase.\n\nWe ordered a mushroom cheese burger. It is very juicy. The bread is moist and not dry at all.  For the free appetizer, we had chicken nachos. It is very big in portion. The nachos are mixed with shredded chicken, salsa and guacamole, a fun combination. \n\nService.is very nice and attentive. A very good deal with the coupon.

The fries were superb, cooked to perfection, and just all around delicious. The milkshake was by and far the highlight of the meal. I HIGHLY recommend the chocolate milkshake here, it's among the best I've had, and easily worth the $5 price tag, especially on a hot Vegas day.\n\nThe service overall was good. It took forever for our waitress to show up initially, but after that she quickly refilled our waters before we were even finished, and quickly took care of the check. All and all, a very positive experience, and while a bit pricey for a burger and shake, it's location and great tasting shake make up for it."

You can enjoy your burger while downing some great cocktails and watch the people walk by.\n\nI agree with  Jonathan Z and say that they are about the same league as Red Robin.  They have really good selection of burgers for decent prices. The burger patty isn't anything fancy here, just your typical ground beef patty.  Don't expect any kobe beef or wagyu beef patty here.  \n\nLast time we came here for lunch, I got the green chili burger which I really enjoyed and the BF got the mexicali burger.  The only downside that I would have to say about their burgers is that it get soggy really fast.  I don't know if it's the grease or sauce they put in the burgers but even after like 30 minutes, my burger would start breaking apart.  But still good nonetheless!\n\nMy favorite here is their garlic herb fries.  A great addition to get for your burgers.  Skip the atomic cheese fries.  Too messy and not all that great.\n\nOther than that, it's a pretty chill place to come if you're in the area.  Decently priced and decently flavored."

That's the only reason this place was considered prior to our group taking the trip to Vegas. Our coupon was a $100 gift certificate for $200 (or more) of food and drink.\n\nSo now for the food.....it was.....well, good! Quite a few of us had the turkey burger (we added guacamole). There was nothing super extravagant about it, but it was definitely a good turkey burger. Our table had the trifecta of fries: fresh-cut, garlic herb, and sweet potato. The sweet potato fries were the only ones that did not get devoured. They just didn't work for us. Kinda gross actually. A few of us actually went back the next day for late night eats. I had the Ahi Tuna burger. Good and unique tasting, but that's all. Just....good.\n\nNow, if you're a drinker you might have came to the right place! The Jumbo Cocktails will get you where you need to go....if you're choosing to go \"there\" (this is where the restaurant.com coupon really comes in handy). They come in 16 and 32oz. mason jars. The 32oz. Tableside Margarita won't disappoint you! Also, be careful! Some of the people in our party had some drinks that were not too tasty. I'm not sure which ones they are, but get a quick taste before your waiter/waitress leaves the table in case you need to send it back and order something else.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience!

Definitely worth a stop if you need some cheap eats.  Service was very solid too (and a little busy around 6:30PM) and there's bar seating as well as some tables.  \n\nThe regular menu consists of burgers/drinks and a few other items.  Along with a PBR and a slider, I tried out the veggie burger.  The taste of the veggie burger wasn't too bad although it wasn't the best I've had.  The slider too was not too shabby - it was a pretty good deal for $2 although the sauce was a little too zesty for my tastes.  \n\nThe scene seemed like a mix of tourists and locals (around happy hour at least) and again, if you're nearby the area, not too shabby of a spot to pick up some cheap grub."

I do remember that I liked it quite a bit. It's a modest little joint with modern looking silver tables and chairs. Cute hostess--pretty much what you'd expect. I actually opted to try their seared ahi tuna burger, my friend went for their more traditional cheeseburger. They both came out really well. They got the sear just right on the ahi, served it in a flaky wheat bun and lathered it in mouthwatering guacamole that tasted quite fresh to me. My friends burger (which I had a few bites of) was juicy and cooked to order. We shared an order of fries, which were particuarly tasty. Much better than your average fast food burger joint fries (why do any of us still go to those places anyway??) as they had bits of skin still on them and were not excessively greasy. They served a cool, clean glass of lemonade (fresh squeezed I believe) which was quite refreshing given the weather at the time.\n\nThe service is decent, the view is nice and its kinda trendy but not the least bit formal-- I don't think you even need a shirt to eat here---and its conveniently located if you just woke up from a night of excessive partying. I enjoyed it and would certainly plan on going back here the next time an opportunity presents itself."

Ordered the fried straws and fries combo and it was perfect!!!!  \n\nOur server was efficient and polite but  a tad slow on refilling water glasses. Unfortunately, there was a group of people whom they were fawning over to the point of being ridiculous.

The place was dead for lunch on a Saturday so there was no problem getting a table.\n\nOur waitress greeted us quickly and let us know about the burger special. The menu had many delicious sounding options. I decided on the mini burger sampler which included a blue cheese burger, whiskey burger, and cheddar burger. It didn't come with fries which was fine because I wanted to try the trio of fries, onion strings, and pickle chips. My husband quickly decided on the bison burger topped with a fried Hatch chile and served with fries. He also ordered a cookies-n-cream milkshake.\n\nThe cookies-n-cream milkshake is amazing. I couldn't stop stealing sips of it. I also like that they serve it on the thicker side so that it isn't a melted mess in the Vegas heat as soon as it is served. The burger sampler was a good portion of food and easier to eat than one big burger. They weren't bad burgers, but the amazing flavor I anticipated just wasn't there. I can't say it was one of the best burgers that I've had. My husband felt the same way about his burger. I'd say the same for the fries and onion strings. The pickle chips were okay, but didn't contain much pickle. \n\nOverall, there isn't anything terribly wrong with this place, but it isn't the best option in the area for burgers."

We spit an order of the threesome (fries, onion straws, fried pickles) and could barely make it through half the bowl.

Service was quick, I was immediately approached by the bartender and received my burger after about 12 minutes.  I opted for the jalapeno popper burger, which has the typical burger veggies, bacon, jalapeno and fried cheddar.  The fried cheddar is what lured me in, and it was fantastic.  It was crispy and added great texture to the burger to go with the cheesy flavor.  I could have used more jalapeno, I'll order extra when I get the burger again.  My main issue with the burger was I ordered it medium and it came out medium well at best.  Still had some juice, but it was certainly overcooked.  \n\nOn the side, I had the onion strings.  You get a huge basket for $3.95, easily enough to share.  I liked them, but they could have been a little thicker for my taste, they were extremely thin strings.  But, great crunch and nice onion flavor.  \n\nHad the burger been cooked to medium and the onion strings a little thicker, this would be a 4 star review.  But, it was much better than I remember, and I'll be back next time I have to go to the mall."

Love the outdoor seating that let you people watch while you eat and have a beer.\n\nI had the Southwest burger. Was very juicy with a nice kick from the chipotle mayo.The patty was cooked to a perfect medium upon request.All the usual suspects were there and fresh....lettuce,toms,onions,etc. The bun was very soft and fresh as well but not toasted which is a peeve of mine.If you don't eat it rather fast it will get soggy like my wife's did cause she took her time with it but I tore mine up quick so no biggie!\n\nThe onion string fries were killer...sliced very thin and fried perfectly ...not greezy at all! Definitely worth checking out if your on that end of the strip or at fashion island mall."

We discovered this on a walk to Capital Grille and were instantly hooked (and 20min late to meet our group at the Grille). Their happy hour is the best I have had in Vegas and the bartenders have always rocked. Not a big place so if you can belly up to the bar then go for it. It felt like the $1 (maybe $2) happy hour drinks lasted forever."

Totally necessary.\n\nI wasn't thrilled with the threesome of sides, fries were good, and omg was I in love with their pickle fries, but half the basket was onion strings which I could have done without.\n\nComing over to offer dessert the waiter let us know that if we weren't interested in the milkshakes he could bring over the dessert menu from the Mexican place next store which is the same owner (and I guess kitchen). I kinda wish I was the one to order the chocolate cake instead of just just having a few bites."

That's just a huge minus in my book.  If I were rating this place based solely on doneness, I would have given one star.\n\nThe fries were fries.  Not sure I could have gotten any better than that.  At least they weren't limp, cold and/or overly greasy.  The garlic fries were pretty garlicky (duh) and onion rings were nice and big.  \n\nOne of my companions ordered a bowl of chili.  Why you come to a burger joint and order chili - or why a burger joint even offers chili - is beyond me.  But whatever.  The chili comes and my companion is like, \"this is a bowl?\"  The eensy weensy ramekin has roughly four or five large spoonfuls of chili.  I might be exaggerating (not much), but for the price, you'd really expect a bowl to be, well, a bowl. \n\nThe service was acceptable, though we did see the bottoms of our drinks a few too many times.  What's strange is that our server took our glasses from us and went in the back to get refills.  I am not sure why they don't have pitchers or why she didn't just bring us an additional glass.  Whatever it was, refilling could have been far more efficient.\n\nAfter having a below average burger, average fries and passable service, I'm not sure why anyone would go out of their way to come here.  I guess the old business adage about location is true."

You have to order any sides or fries separately. \nMy friends and I ordered the garlic fries. Good enough to share between 3 people. HOLY SHI*.....that after garlic breathe was harsh!!! The garlic was so strong, there was a bitter taste on every few bites.  I had to mask my breath with Listerine mint strips and chewing gum for a good 3 hours. I brushed my teeth AND tongue extra long that night. I def wouldn't order that again. Should of gotten the cheese fries....oh wells...\n\nThis is all outdoor seating only. So if it's 104+ degrees...you may want to reconsider. Why go out to eat somewhere only to be sitting in your own sweat?! No thank you. Also, it's not located IN the fashion show mall. You have to walk outside to Las Vegas Blvd to access their entrance. I think the reason why people rave about this place are their milkshakes. But their burgers....nothing special at all."

We ordered a side of fries (the burgers do not come with a side). \n\nThe pickle \"fries\" came out first but were actually chips instead of spears. I was expecting spears and prefer them over the chips but these fried sour pickle chips were pretty darn good! I have come to the conclusion that the best pickle to batter and fry is the good old sour dill. Sliced thin and coated with a light crispy batter, these pups didn't last long. \n\nOur burgers arrived and Whoa Nellie are they huge! My burger was laden with roasted Hatch green chiles, melted pepper jack cheese, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce and onions. The burger was thick, juicy and full of flavor. Grilled to perfection and served piping hot once I picked it up it never kissed the plate again. Fries? What fries. I was too busy with my burger. I did manage to try one and it was a-ok. But really you don't need no stinkin' fries! H declared his burger superior to the Cheeseburger in Paradise found you-know-where. \n\nThe staff's friendly and they work together well. I spotted several heaters for when the weather is cold but have no idea what they do when summer hits L.V. If you are looking for a quick, cheap and insanely great burger look no further than Stripburger."

The grease these were cooked in must have been several years old. The burger was good and perfectly cooked, but the bun was mushy with grease. Guess the cook does not know to let the meat rest for a few minutes.\n\nGo to this only in an emergency when you are starved and must eat within a few minutes. Otherwise, go anywhere else!"

We stopped to check out the menu, but when we heard about the $2 happy hour specials, we were sold. \n\nWe sat outside along the bar, and while it was chilly outside, those heat lamps made it nice and toasty. Not much of a view of the strip at the corner of the Fashion Mall, but we did some people watching across the street from the Wynn hotel. We ordered a couple cheeseburgers and hamburger sliders each, along with some fries. The wait seemed to take forever, especially for such little-sized burgers. But when the food did arrive, we devoured those little suckers pretty fast. \n\nThe burgers were tasty and juicy, a great deal at a couple bucks each. I also thought that the $8-9 price for one of their regular sized burgers wasn't too shabby either, considering it is Vegas. All in all, a good place to go if you don't want to either spend a ton of money at a sit-down restaurant or eat hot dogs on a stick with the teenage crowd at the food court upstairs. \n\n6 mini burgers, 1 order of fries, and 2 beers for around $20. Less money out of my wallet = more money for gambling. Or in my wife's case, more money for shopping."

Aged 24-25, we were anticipating a REALLY wild weekend full of hot people, and hot clubs... hot music, hot gambling, great food, great drinks.... and guess what, we were disappointed.  Despite my disillusionment  with Las Vegas as a bona fide Disneyland for adults (more like Wally World, I think) I have at least one good thing to bring away from my trip that I can recommend to other travelers, locals, or disillusioned 25 year old women:  Stripburger.  There are a few reasons that I decided to give a little place like Stripburger in Las Vegas five stars: \n\n1) Location.  Stripburger was right across from our hotel, on the ground level.  Easy access from the street, with patio seating to people watch on the Vegas strip. \n\n2) GREAT HAPPY HOUR.  We actually had food and drinks NOT during happy hour, and it was good.  But the happy hour was really great.  Not only is it 4-7 pm EVERY DAY (yes, including Sat/Sun), but they have a straight across $2 menu that includes drinks and food.  I have to recommend the margaritas, which are a good size for the money, and which taste like margaritas, not a melted lemon-lime Otter pop.  Very cheap and fun way to party before heading out for the night. \n\n3) Service was great.  Our lunch waitress and our happy hour staff were all amazing, friendly and attentive.\n\nFor a large group of boisterous, hungry/thirsty women, Stripburger definitely fit the bill."

Add some contemporary culinary sweet and savory delectables into the mix and you got Stripburger.\n\nLocated at the Fashion Show Mall, seated right on the Strip (hence its name \"Stripburger\"), one is immediately welcomed to sit in the covered patio area.  Since the whipping winds were not in effect on this particular day, my co-workers/fellow foodies and I gladly took a table on the patio.  Although I had studied the menu a few days before our burger lunch date, I still reviewed it thoughtfully once we were seated.  I hadn't changed my mind, I still wanted to give that Mexican Burger a day in court and oh, what the hell, the peanut butter and chocolate milkshake.  It's Friday after all, I figured, live a little.  Then one of my burger buddies piped up and asked, \"Do you want to order some fries?\"  Yeah, I'm living today and then some.  We couldn't decide between the sweet potato fries and the garlic herb fries until our very sweet and accommodating server responded that we could get half and half.  Let's do this.\n\nWhile the three of us waited for our food, two of us got our milkshakes.  My fellow milkshake mate got a cookies and cream that looked amazing.  My shake was deliciously thick, not overly rich or peanut buttery, but just the right amount of both peanut butter and chocolate.  Noticeably, neither one of us shared with the other.  Perhaps that's a very telling thing: those shakes were just so damn good, who wants to share?  Then our food arrived and was picture perfect...kind of like the website photos.  The basket of fries was put down in front of me and I just dug into those before I even touched my burger.  It was a nice equal amount of both sweet potato and garlic fries.  Note: the sweet potato fries are sprinkled with what one of my lovely cohorts referred to as \"sugary goodness.\" I say it was sugar and spice and everything nice about those sweet potatoes.  The garlic fries were as amazing topped with fresh pressed garlic and herbs.  I finally switched my attention to the main event by cutting into my burger.  \n\nTopped with a jalapeno pepper, my burger was beautifully cooked medium rare to my specification.  It was filled with cotija cheese, cilantro, pickled red onions, jalapeno, tomato, lettuce and chipotle mayo and not a drop crumbled onto the plate, my lap or tore in half when I bit into it.  With most designer burgers or even those double stacked types piled a mile higher than a mouth can actually open, the filling usually bursts out, leaving a smooshed mess in its wake.  At the risk of being Goldilocks here, this burger was not too stuffed and not too under-stuffed but just right. \n\nAnd that sums up my experience at Stripburger.  I walked away not too stuffed and definitely not under-stuffed, but just right and completely satisfied.  The service was great, the ambience for a Friday afternoon on the Strip was lovely, and the food was excellent.  I will be back to try a different burger and a different variety of fries (the atomic cheese fries piques my interest).  Perhaps next time, I will try an adult beverage with my burger (hello beer mojito)."

Today, I stopped in for lunch/dinner.\n\nI opted to sit at the bar and chat with Rebecca, the bar keep and my server.  She got me an iced tea while I looked at the menu.  Good server, very pleasant woman!\n\nI had looked at the menu online and was all set to order the burger I had chosen when I did a switch and went with the mini burger sampler.  This consists of three sliders--the blue cheese burger, the whiskey BBQ burger, and the cheddar burger.   I asked for the burgers to be done rare and they were.  That was a bit surprising because of their smaller size.  They cooked them the way they should.  With the burger, I got an order of garlic, herb fries which was large enough to feed me and the two other people at the bar.\n\nWhile waiting, I enjoyed the people watching which is a big draw for this place.  Being on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fashion Show Drive and with all seating being patio seating, it's a great place if you just want to have a drink and watch the tourists go by.  \n\nOf the burger sampler, I liked the blue cheese and the whiskey BBQ the best.  All three were good, but these two were better.  The fries were excellent.  So much garlic, good herb seasoning, and lots of salt on my part and I was set.\n\nMy iced tea was refilled without asking.  I'd bring my wife here sometime if it wasn't so difficult to get to.  It is outside at the farthest corner of Fashion Show Mall.  Maybe I'll just go back myself."

The burger is so messy but super delicious and it's pretty big- better to cut it in half first makes it easier to eat. I really enjoyed my lunch and had such an enjoyable time just eating after walking the entire strip and shopping all day.

We went yesterday in hopes of enjoying a great burger and great atmosphere based on current reviews. I'm surprised that only one other review mentioned the uncleanliness of this place.   I'm not that picky but this place was awful.    \n\nThe worst part about eating here is the smell.  The outside area has this stomach turning sour smell that reeks of spilled drinks, old food, and general grime.    The doors to the actual inside area are filthy and covered with fingerprints and looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a few years.   The outside table was clean but the white chairs they seat you in are filthy too covered in dirty fingerprints and years of dirt buildup.   \n\nWe ordered sodas and my soda came in a dirty glass with dried mustard on the side.   I was quickly losing faith that this was going to be a good experience.   I just kept smelling that awful sour smell as did my husband.  \n\nI ordered the mini burger trio and my husband the bacon cheeseburger.  We shared an order of garlic herb fries.  Definitely share sides if you come here because they are more than enough for one person.    The mini burger trio was just okay and I say just okay because it there was barely any meat and a lot of bun.  The best kind of burger was the blue cheese burger so I wish I would have just ordered that on its own.  My husband said his burger was alright but the construction of it was awful.  They put the tomato on the bottom which caused the bottom bun to disinegrate before he could even finish his sandwich.  \n\nThe final bill came to over 40 dollars which I think is pretty spendy for what you get here but it is the Strip so it wasn't that bad.   This place would be much more fun to eat at if the owners hadn't let it get so run down and smelly.    I'd eat here again but only if it was given a thorough cleaning."

I've eaten here a few times a few years ago when I used to work at Fashion Show but recently came back again from my boyfriend's draft day. If you guys don't know, all seating is outdoors but there's misters everywhere so it's not too bad. Overall just for food taste and quality I would give them 3 stars.\n\nThe biggest pros for this place which raise it from 3 stars to 4 stars:\n-They are always open pretty late! Friday & Saturday till 2 am and the rest of the week till 1 am.\n-They have winter drink specials from December-January for $1 drinks!\n-$7.95 Adult milkshakes (Holstein's in Cosmopolitan has them $13; much more flavors offered but just a note on price)\n\nOnto my most recent food experience! I got the Nacho Fries $9.95 which have melted atomic cheese, guac, pico, jalapenos, sour cream and cilantro. These were really good, lots of toppings, definitely settled the craving for fries and nachos all in one! It doesn't come with meat but you can add some if you'd like. As for the atomic cheese, I didn't taste any spiciness at all but I have a pretty high heat tolerance so maybe I didn't notice. The boyfriend is a little weaker regarding heat and he didn't seem bothered at all by it.\nFor the burger we got the Mexican burger $10.95 which included chipotle mayo, pickled red onions, jalapenos, cotija & jack cheese, and cilantro. This was pretty good as well. I could taste all of the ingredients they said it has, you know cause some places will say there's about 10 things in an item and you're like uhmmm I only taste 2? lol Not with this burger. Everything had good flavor and hit the spot. \n\nPricing is pretty decent for what you get on the strip. I just hate that it's outdoors. They also offer quite a bit of specialty cocktails, some salads and chicken sandwiches as well. A good option if you're at Fashion Show but I wouldn't exactly crave this place because of all the other burger options around the strip that I feel are better and located indoors! Overall a good experience though :)"

Oh & you can add a shot to their milkshakes as well.\n\nOver all the service & experience was quite good & we would go back.\n\nThe bill came to $50 including tip.\n\nSide note: they did misspell Wagyu on the menu..."

They are a great place for lunch my favorite is their chicken sandwich it will not let you down and goes great with cheese fries. Also happy hour is great $2 beer and 4 dollar margaritas how can you go wrong. Problem is that the food comes out 2 times faster when your at the bar making it worth it to sneak a spot if there is one. The bartenders are amazing they are always fun and make sure that everything gets done right. The managers are great too they will talk with you and actually care that everything is good, and take the time to find out about your day and how all is going. Again its a good place to eat."

Plus if you are going to eat at the Stripburger you might as well have a good view of the strip na-wha-mean!\n\nSo me and my boy ordered, he got the mushroom burger which is really big and lots and lots of mushrooms on it and I ordered the bar burgers which comes with 3 individual burger with chesse and veggies.  The bun here is really good in has a distinct taste to it and the burger patties here are really juicy and you can literally taste the juiciness of beef in almost every bite.

Strip Burger is located at the North end of the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas Strip. Most of the seating is outdoors with a great view of the Wynn and Encore hotels. There is some seating inside for the colder months we have here in Vegas, so don't worry about the weather if you want to stop in for some great American fare.\n\nStrip Burger has the usual drink selection of soft drinks and beers. Something there to satisfy any thirst. But if you want something more that just something to drink, Strip Burger also has a homemade shake. The shakes come in several flavors such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cookies & cream. Each shake is so creamy and flavorful you will be asking if free refills are provided. No they are not. I was saddened at this. If you need something to cool you off when the weather is a bit hotter I can guaranty a Strip Burger Shake will hit the spot. Give it a try and you will see for yourself.\n\nIf fresh cut fries are your thing, make your way to Strip Burger. Their fries have a great potato taste, are perfectly cooked and just lightly salted with a coarse salt. They also offer sweet potato fries and one of my favorite things, fried onion strings. The onion strings are like onion rings, but they are not greasy and they are thin and crunchy. A real taste treat.\n\nA Strip Burger burger may not be Angus Beef, but Angus is not always the only choice for a really good burger. The beef used in their burger is flavorful, juicy and keeps it's form well. The burger seems to be a third pound. The bun is soft, tasty and holds the burger very well. They do their burger several different ways all providing a flavor sensation in your mouth. I get the bacon cheddar burger now when I go. The bacon has a bit of a crunch to it but is not overcooked. The cheddar is nice and thick and complements the beef nicely. When you bite into your burger for the first time the juices flow and the meat provides a nice texture and flavor. This is not the best burger I have ever had, but it is very close.\n\nSome restaurants can have bad days. Both in service and food quality. Strip Burger has had neither when I have been there. The servers and very friendly and are always there when you need something. Everything is brought to your table in a timely manner and picked up just as quickly when you are done. And the outdoor seating provides an open feel. You can't go wrong at Strip Burger."

So we get seated and start looking over the menu, some interesting burger choices, a la carte like the standard hipster \"gourmet\" burger joints...our waiter comes over and we order a water and coke...we get them about 10 minutes later and we put in our app order...my friend has an allergy to dairy and we were quite clear about that...so we start with the quac and chips...so while waiting for that my buddy tastes his coke and it is ultra weak, our waiter had dissapeared so we grab another waitress and tell her, she takes the soda and puts in on another table then asks what else he would like, he tells her Mr Pibb, so she then just goes off and works at other tables, meanwhile our waiter still AWOL...when he does come back we see the waitress tell him that the drink sucks and he then dissapears again for about 5 minutes with the Mr. Pibb (why the hell didn't she get us the replacement drink)...in the meantime we get our guac and guess what there is cojita cheese on top, this wasn't listed on the menu that way and of course we told the waiter no dairy !   WTF is wrong with these places, I wonder how many people die each year due to allergic reactions at restaurants i bet it would be surprising...and moreover why does guac need cheese?  So the guy who brought it out went straight back and got us a replacement, not our waiter a runner, so after another 10 minutes the waiter comes back and asks what we want to order for dinner, not saying anything about the mistakes, etc...so we order a couple of burgers...as he was going back the older couple near us flagged him down and said \"are we gonna have to wait as long as them to order\"   lol   He said \"of course not\" then he disappeared...we then waited about 15 minutes for the food to come out...place was about a quarter full...anyways the burgers were at least what we had ordered but wow very average and nothing gourmet about them, my burger was over cooked but again I was starving at this point so said f*ck it....meanwhile I notice the older couple near us still hasn't been able to order...geez...so we eat our burgers and the waiter doesn't return/ask how everything is until we are done then comes with the check...bottom line this place sucks, is way overpriced and the service is god awful !

This is exactly what happened when I ventured into Stripburger the other day, and I'm glad I did. I'm starting to get very skeptical of restaurants in general located on the strip due to the fact that they don't really have to try and yet mass amounts of tourists will still flock to them, so I welcome the surprise.\n\nStripburger is unfortunately located on the corner sidewalk at the Fashion Show Mall across the street from the Wynn hotel. Parking is typically atrocious at the mall, but pretty much your only option unless you happen to be walking down the sidewalk in this area. There's a 99% chance you are not. What I didn't know until I arrived is that the restaurant is entirely outdoors; this is horribly inconvenient in the dead of summer, and potentially not great either come January. I suppose the awnings might help a bit in the summer although based on experience not too much, and the heat lamp that was placed directly behind me more than made up for the fact that it was overcast and maybe 55 degrees the day I was there.\n\nSurprisingly there are several burgers to choose from on the menu, along with a slider option, a turkey burger and a veggie burger that my friend hesitantly ordered in front of me. They also offer shakes, salads, a bunch of chicken sandwiches and some other items. Plus, since this is an outdoor bar/restaurant right on the sidewalk, a large collection of cocktails are also available. I was in the mood for something simple and went with a classic cheeseburger and fresh cut fries. I quickly got worried when not only did the guy next to me get the wrong order, but when our food came out they also brought me the wrong burger. I was left with that bad situation of having fries and no burger, and the person I was eating with had their food. Luckily mine came out only a minute or two later.\n\nThe burger itself doesn't look like anything special; a decent plain bun, melted cheese, lettuce, tomatoes pickles and mayo. What surprised me was how well it tasted, the meat was cooked perfectly, and had great flavor with a hint of some pepper which I liked. It was juicy but not overly messy, dripped just a bit and left a small puddle on the plate yet the meat still maintained its moisture until the end. The pickles had good flavor, the bun was buttery, and was just the right ratio to the amount of meat. It tasted great and I was happy.\n\nThe fries could have been perfect too, but I think we got a mix of old and new so some were soft and great, while others were a bit hard and stale. I think it was also scooped from the bottom as we had a lot of small pieces in the bowl. Still they were quite good, maybe a bit too salty but I really liked their overall flavor and were quite bountiful.\n\nThe price was about what one could expect for being located on the strip, I think if it were more of a local's spot I'd have more of a problem spending around $30 for two burger meals. The location isn't ideal, but if you're already over there or don't mind going near the strip as much as I do then it's definitely worth the visit."

When she came back, we ordered the guac and chips, blue cheese burger, and the Mexican burger.

The server never came back to see how our food turned out or needed more to drink.  She was rarely out in the dining area, and when she was, she was taking an order from what had to be more than a dozen tables she appeared to be working.  I finally had to flag her down long after we had finished eating to get the bill.  I don't know when she would have gotten around to checking on us if I hadn't.  Never a word of explanation, so I have to assume this was a normal night.\nOverall, while the food was decent and the location was nice, this place just isn't worth the hassle.

Butterscotch served with a big straw please! Atomic fries are my fav, with garlic herb fries a close second. I love this place so much, feel free to invite me when you go!"

It is just too decadent for words...get one (or three if you're hungry) and 2) the salted caramel is yummy and delicious with baileys in it. \n\nWe also had a great server who had some Intense eye contact, Wysouri was most attentive!!!\n\nIf you're looking for a place to cool off in Vegas, this is seriously the spot! They have water spritzers at the bar and adult milkshakes! Exactly what you need in 113 degree heat!!"

We went to another table and the waitress in that station came over to get out drink order however we told her the other waitress got it, just not our order. We mustve been invisible to her because she didn't bring our drinks nor tell the other waitress what our drinks were. The table next to us got water and drinks before us, so I waited a few more minutes and the waitress came over to say that she didn't know what was going on but what was our drinks. Forget it, im leaving because this is just poor service.\n\nThat waitress should find a job she enjoys doing because this is definitely not her thing!

They were ALL good, but the Blue Cheese Burger was out of this world!! Their sweet potato fries and garlic herb fries were TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend this place. The atmosphere is relaxed, it's all patio style seating. The ONLY thing that went wrong during our visit here was our ticket got lost, for our table of 11.

And sitting out in the open air, along the Las Vegas Strip will make you think you've sat down in a dream of tasty treats.  \n\nTheir menu is filled with great burger, fry and milkshake choices.  When we were there we ordered up the bacon and cheddar burger, green chili cheeseburger and hickory bacon burger.  And Stripburger was close to spot on with each offering.  The bacon toppings were delicious and perfectly crisp.  The cheese was gooey and oh so good.  The patties themselves were solid, but not the greatest taste in the burger world.  Our complaint?  Green chilis that were pickled and spiceless.  Seriously?  If you're going to offer a green chile burger then knock me out.  The chilis should light my mouth on fire.  These chilis were tasty enough (i.e., I enjoy the taste of pickles), but bland when it comes to spice.\n\nWe also ordered up some green chile fries and sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries are award-winning.  The chile fries?  Eh.  Same problem as the chile burger discussed above.  \n\nSounds like a decent burger joint right?  So why the four stars?  Well, the answer lies in Stripburger's milkshakes.  Wow.  Just wow.  According to Homer, the Greek Gods reclining on Mount Olympus feasted on ambrosia.  The gods were cheated.  Ambrosia is boring nonsense compared to the Stripburger butterscotch or cookies and cream milkshake.  Sooooooooo good.  I'd head over there just for the milkshakes even if I didn't want a burger."

I don't have a very high expectation for drinks in Vegas anyway - so I accepted whatever they could do. They were flexible in fixing the drinks if you don't like them. \n\nI ordered their vegetarian burger... and I can swear to anything that they have the best in the whole country.. Being a vegetarian, i have tried veggie burgers at a LOT of places.. The patty is not a generic hard soy / black bean patty - it had a soft melt-in-mouth patty with actual veggies and cashews. It is rich, flavorful and indulging. I always have one extra reason to go to Vegas."

Well, they don't open until 11 so we wandered around and came back at 11. \n\nWe got a really friendly server with what we thought was an Australian accent. Turns out he was actually from Boston. He was very prompt with the order taking and made a couple suggestions with the food as well. His suggestions probably made my burger better tasting too. He was definitely a people person and seemed to like his job. Far better than those servers that just do the bare minimum. Great server.\n\nMy girl got the bacon cheddar burger and I tried the southwest burger. We split a basket of fries and onion strings. Share those things... they're huge! I can easily say that this was the best tasting burger I've ever had and I love a good burger. The bacon was thick and actually cooked all the way unlike most places that can't figure out how to cook bacon. My girl thoroughly enjoyed her burger as well.

            "review": "This was my first time at Stripburger. Overall, it was a great experience. 5 stars for food, minus 1 star for value. \n\nI ordered the mini burger sampler with the blue cheese burger, the whisky bbq burger and the cheddar burger. The bf and I split the strings & fries, and I got a margarita. \n\nBurgers: Delicious! I ordered them cooked medium well, but I couldn't tell the difference between mine and my bf's, who ordered his medium... But that was ok. They were definitely juicy and flavorful! The bun is slightly sweet, and the blue cheese is more of a spread-- but was very tasty and added just the right amount of kick. The tomatoes were diced, which was an added bonus (I really don't like the gooey seed part of the tomato!)\n\nStrings & Fries: Both were delicious. I favored the strings, but I'm glad we got both, they balanced each other out well. \n\nMargarita: One of the best I've had in a LONG time! I'd rate it pretty strong, but definitely very tasty. \n\nAmbiance: This is an outdoor/open air restaurant, and we visited at night (on the 4th of July) so the strip was hopping. It was also fairly warm 93 at 11:30pm, but the temp felt great with the fans running. I'd recommend an evening visit--the lights from the strip were great, and the heat wasn't as bad as it could be. \n\nValue: This is where I take it down to 4 stars. I'd say it's a little spendier than similar burger places, with the fries being ala carte. But we had a deal from travel zoo, which made it super affordable! Check out the deal if still available-- 2 people each get an entree, 1 side and 2 drinks each for 1/2 price. The bf even got a vanilla shake (which was exceptionally great!)"

I definitely see the potential this place has because of the great location. \n\nIt was way too late to eat a burger so I opted for a turkey cobbish salad and a side of over the top spicy chili that I could not eat so I gave it to my hub since he can stomach that kind of spice.\n\nI was definitely not impressed by the food, the amount of food and the prices that were attached to them. My $10 salad was not worth the dough the $7 chili didn't taste that fresh and the $6 german beer was the only thing this meal had going for it. \n\nNow concerning the cleanliness of the place, there were about 10 employees running around an almost empty restaurant but the bar area where I was seated was dirty and yucky and every table that was empty had old food and waste from previously customers. \n\nI really wanted to love or at least like this place but so far this burger joint has 100% fallen short of what is expected from a restaurant. At this point I wish this was a smash burger joint instead of what it is. The only thing I would recommend this place for are drinks and that's it."

The burgers are pretty good not as much meat variety as Burger Bar, but different types of toppings and configurations.  I ordered my burger medium rare but they must have gotten mixed up because mine came out medium well.  Oh well it was still good nonetheless.  We also ordered the Atomic fries.  Basically it's just fries, cheese, and raw jalapenos.  Wow they were amazingly good and made the whole meal worth it.  The best of both worlds would be atomic fries from here and burgers from burger bar.  LOL I'll be back for the fries but I prefer my burger from burger bar."

Quite pricey for burgers but is still reasonable compared to other restaurants in Las Vegas. The staffs are all very friendly, they came to check on us every now and then and never pressured to hurry us on ordering from their menu.\n\nMy favourite was their Sweet Potato Fries which was around $5. So good on its own, but the dip is also really good, plus the portion is satisfying. Their burgers - again - are alright and not greasy ( which i like), but my favourite is the whiskey barbecue burger. One thing i love about it is their sweet sauce, and that their onions are crispy and nice. \n\nOverall good for late night snacks or dinner, but ill have to turn down 1 star because of its price and ok taste for their other burgers."

            "review": "I love this place!!  I currently live in Hawaii and travel to the mainland a lot for work (and for fun).  I always stop in Vegas to break up the trip (horrible flyer) and though I stumbled upon this little gem while staying at the Trump, I now make it a point to stop in even if I am staying at the opposite end of the strip.  Here is why:\n\na) the food is great!  While this isn't a 5 star restaurant inside of a 5 star hotel, it is a burger and shake place that is really really good at what they specialize in!  I think I have tried every burger on the menu and I haven't been disappointed yet.\n\nb) the price-  They have a great happy hour--- even still, I am almost always there before it starts and it doesn't even bother me because prices are so reasonable.  And the burgers are huge- you get what you pay for\n\nc) location- I actually love that it isn't right smack in the middle of the strip.  It is close enough to be convenient and walking distance regardless of where you are staying, but not as in your face as all those restaurants lined up on the strip with people bombarding you with flyers offering drink specials to lure you in.  There is a lot of hustle and bustle in that area and its nice to be able to get a mini break from that (and its all outside too which is nice).\n\nd) service-  this was really the best part for me. As someone that has worked in the industry for years in the past, I am extremely lenient when it comes to sub-par service as I know what it feels like to be on the other side of that especially when it is extremely busy or you are down a server, etc.  I always try to be polite and understanding regardless.  But, on the flip side- bartending/serving in high-volume restaurants for so many years has also allowed me to know an amazing bartender/server when I see one.  And let me tell you, the bartender here is one of the best there is.  I travel solo a lot so really the only people I come in contact with outside of work are those in the service industry.  I try to follow their lead and if they are busy I just focus on my food/drinks and if they are friendly and not slammed, I make a new pseudo friend for a few minutes.  I was extremely impressed with Rebecca (I think that is her name- it is the name on my receipt but sometimes bartenders share registers-- she is the lunch bartender-- I usually go on monday or tuesday when I am in vegas).  She is sweet as pie and sociable but still really aware of her surroundings and attentive; super fast and knows her stuff.  Its not uncommon to find a funny and likeable bartender or an extremely fast and skillful one- but in my experience it is very rare to find someone that is both!  In this industry people often work their butts off and do not always get the recognition they deserve...  so I decided to take a few minutes to make sure that doesn't happen here!  She is by far one of my favorites...and I travel a lot.\n\nOverall, I love this place and look forward to going back on my next vegas trip!  Oh, and in case you guys didn't know... you can take alcohol to go and walk down the strip with it!  I discovered this while here and thought it was awesome....and crazy.  So obviously I ordered an alcoholic milkshake to go!  And... I suggest you do the same. stat."

            "review": "Thanks, Strip Burger, for being open on Easter Sunday.  But boo to you for your hiring decisions.\n\nStrip Burger is a burger joint on the strip (clever, huh!).  We went to the fashion show mall location.  It was open on Easter, even though the rest of the mall wasn't.\n\nWe were HUNGRY and happy to find a burger joint with an interesting veggie burger and fried pickles.\n\nWe ordered \"steins\" of cheep beer(they have 16 oz and 32 oz on their menu), I ordered the double original burger, the wife ordered the veggie patty (the rice kind, with nuts and seasonings in the patty) \"done up Mexican style\" (to include roasted jalapenos), and the \"threesome\" (fries, onion rings, and fried pickles).\n\nWe wait. \n\nOur beer comes, but in 16 oz. pint glasses.  We say we wanted steins. The (fairly sweet but obviously naive) server says that she'll just bring us the second half later.\n\nWe wait.\n\nOur food comes (thank goodness... most of the other diners had to wait a lot longer).  My wife's burger is cold, and doesn't come with the Mexican fixings she asked for.  The onion rings are really straws, good for putting on hamburgers, but way too stringy to eat by themselves.  The pickles are OK, but there aren't enough of them, and the fries are tasty.  My burger is tasty, but certainly not better than a top-notch fast food place (Five guys, etc.)  The wife finally gets the roasted jalapeno, and cojita cheese for the \"Mexican\" toppings, but it's just one pepper -- not sliced to put on the burger or anything.  She eats, and the burger proceeds to fall apart.\n\nEverything there is tense, as people aren't getting the right orders, or not getting their order in time.  We get the second half of our beers in traveler cups and get the bill--- she charged us for 4 small beers instead of 2 big ones (which, of course, is more).  Really?  You made a mistake and we have to pay more?  If you don't know what a \"stein\" is, then you should say \"we don't have that.  We have 16 oz glasses and 32 oz mugs/glasses/buckets/whatever.\"\n\nMy burger was fine. My wife's probably would have been fine if it weren't cold.  The atmosphere was nice -- outside on a beautiful day.  But we just had to get out of there as fast as we could.  \n\nSorry, Stripburger, we'll be skipping you next time."

Ordering\nTrevor and I ordered the Whiskey BBQ Burger - fried onion strings, cheddar, bbq sauce infused with jack daniel's ($10.95). We also ordered their special fries: spicy cheese curd fries - hand cut fries, crispy fried cheese curds, sriracha mayo, chopped parsley ($5.95). Dennis ordered the Mexican Burger - chipotle mayo, pickled red onions, jalapeno, cotija & jack cheese, and cilantro ($10.95). Sumana and Wayne both ordered one of the burgers on the specials menu: brie, bacon & fried egg burger - bigger than a \u00bc pounder, melted brie, fried egg, date glazed bacon, hand cut fries ($10.95). We all ordered our burgers medium rare, but the waitress warned Wayne and Sumana that since their patties are smaller, they may come out more medium than medium rare.\n\nII. The burgers\nThe burgers had nice squishy buns that were a little sweet, which complemented the patties well. For me, there was a little too much bun. The meat to bread ratio was a little bread heavy. The burger patty was uneventful. On the menu it says the patties are made with \"our secret recipe of prime cuts of beef, but the patties were a little dry and not very meaty. There was no sear to speak up, but there was some black pepper on the patties. The meat definitely wasn't the star of these burgers. The toppings took the spotlight. \n\nTrev and I ordered the Whiskey BBQ burger, which in addition to the toppings described above also came with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and mayo. It was a little strange for me to have mayo on a BBQ burger, but Trev loved it. The onion strings got lost in the shuffle, which is weird because when I ate one on its own, it had some pow factor. We also got a side of extra pickles, which rocked!\n\nDennis got the Mexican burger and he was worried the cilantro would overpower everything, but it didn't. He said it was a good fusion burger and all the flavors worked together.\n\nSumana and Wayne got the brie, bacon and egg burger. It's weird that they went with a smaller patty on the special burger. The bacon was good, but they didn't really taste the brie. The eggs were cooked over hard, which kind of sucks because it's fun to have the yolk explode everywhere. To be fair, we didn't ask for it over easy. Maybe that was our bad.\n\nIII. The fries\nThe fries have the skin on. They were pretty good! Not too potatoey, but nice and chewy. They could use a tad more salt. The special fries were pretty good, but could use more cheese curds. The sauce was really yummy!\n\nIV. Miscellaneous\nStripburger is located at the Fashion Show Mall. It's all outdoor seating, but they seem to have heaters for when it's cold and fans for when it's hot. The seating is nice and spacious. Since it's located on the corner right next to the street, you get a lot of noise from the cars racing by. It was a little distracting. \n\nOur server, Natalie, was very nice. They accidentally brought our special fries to another table that had the audacity to eat them! So they put in another order and brought it out to us asap. Since it was a mix up, they gave us the fries for free. Natalie was very apologetic and the manager came by to apologize to us as well. \n\nWhen we got the bill, they had automatically split it for us, which was really nice. They also had an automatic gratuity of 18% added. Not sure if it was because we were a bigger party or if it's standard practice. \n\nV. Value\nThe special was a good value since it came with fries, but for the other burgers the value isn't there. These are not worth $11.\n\nVI. The verdict\nIt was alright. It definitely needs more meat flavor! The ratings: 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.3, and 3.3.\n\nNext burger crew meeting: June 21, 2016 at 7pm. Location: TBD (Trev's choice)\nBye, Vegas! It was a crazy weekend!"

We actually went to the mall looking for another restaurant. Once we discovered that the other restaurant was gone, we decided to try this one. And we were pleased with our choice!\n\nMy wife had the Ahi tuna burger and said it was great, tasting like a sushi burger. I decided to try the southwest burger. The chipotle mayo was a nice addition. \n\nIt is important to note that all items are a la carte. So, fries or other sides are ordered in addition to the burgers. This does inevitably increase the total bill a bit.\n\nThe service was good. The waitress had tried most of the items and was able to provide good recommendations. The food arrived rather quick, but not too quick to make you doubt the \"made to order\" status.\n\nShortly into our meal, however, another waiter was walking past with a platter of food. He lost his balance and spilled a couple full plates at our feet. There was sauce and ceramic all over the place. Somehow, most of the mess seemed to avoid our feet. We were not upset, we know accidents happen after all. However, you could tell that the staff was troubled. A manager came by to check on us a couple of times. We repeatedly said that everything was fine, no worries. At the end, our waitress informed us that our fries were being comped by the restaurant. When I got the bill, I also saw that our drinks were covered as well. A nice surprise. Quality service.\n\nThe location for the restaurant is great for people watching. It is right on the corner of the Fashion Show mall. If you sit outside, you can watch the cars and people move down the Strip.\n\nI think Stripburger is worthy of a visit."

I know it's an app but it really isn't for sharing because there's only like 6 rings in here. So get your own basket! No really get your own!\n\nThis is just a great place to chill out and relax. I also love that it is outside too. There is not much of a view unless you like looking at Steve Wynn's billions towering in the desert sky. The food is priced reasonable for Vegas and the Happy Drinks will save you a bunch. Until next time strip burger."

I think one of the biggest draws about this place is that it is easily accessible from the strip (no walking through a casino maze to find it).  Also when I went on a Saturday night, it was very low-key and there weren't many people there (this might have been a fluke however).  It is a little on the pricy side, but not too expensive as long as you share fries, but don't expect to be stuffed when you leave.  Also if you are looking for a bar, this might be a good place.  The bar looked very inviting and was not swarmed with people."

Along with blue cheese, this burger was topped with fried onion straws. The toppings were generous, but I've had better blue cheese- the flavor just wasn't there. The burger was cooked perfectly to my liking, but it's not a very large burger so I left hungry. For the price, I feel like fries should have been included, however, those start at around $4 for a side. But then again, this is on the strip, so everything tends to be overpriced. I'm willing to give this place another shot if I'm in the area, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."

It was a toss-up between here and Burger Bar, but I went with this one.\n\nI sat at the bar and ordered the Southwest Burger because I wanted the chipotle mayo. It's toppings were listed as pepper jack cheese and chipotle mayo. I also ordered the sweet potato fries and an Orange Whip alcoholic beverage. \n\nThe burger was mediocre at best. I didn't taste any Southwestern flavors and the cheese was bland as well. The chipotle mayo was good, but the flavor was not strong enough, which is the reason I got the burger in the first place. There was nothing spectacular about the burger whatsoever. I could've had a V8, as the commercial goes. However, the sweet potato fries were to die for! I loved them and couldn't stop eating them and had I known better, would have just ordered an order of those and skipped the burger. They were hot, sweet potato-y and had salt (sea salt or other large-grain salt) on them. The salt was almost too much....almost. They came with this BBQ-like sauce that complemented them so well. Yumm! I'm having flashbacks! The Orange Whip beverage had a great taste, but a little more alcohol would've ramped it up tremendously. It's also pretty pricey. I had a burger, sweet potato fries and a 16 oz. alcoholic beverage for $28, not exactly cheap and not worth it either!\n\nThe service was not great. I sat at the bar, the bartender took my order, someone else brought out my food and the bartender didn't ask me about another thing until she saw my napkin on the plate and then gave me the check. I'm sure they're not that concerned with the service with where it's located, but the service could have been much better. \n\nThe only reason I gave this restaurant two stars was for the sweet potato fries. Those were the only redeeming qualities of this experience. I only ever go back for the fries and skip the burger."

The fried onion stings were a little soggy and too greasy for my liking, but the fried pickles were awesome. The french fries were standard fries, nothing to write home about. \nBut a must is to order the chocolate peanut butter milkshake.

The visit experiences were completely opposite of each other and perfect proof that the right wait person makes ALL the difference in a good overall experience.\nVisit number 1 - easily a 4-star visit, close to 5 star for this type of place at this price point\nVisit 2 - might have earned a 3 star rating\n\nBecause I know sometimes stuff happens, I'm giving it my initial 4 star rating.\n\nVisit 1:\nIt could have easily taken a sideways turn, but our waiter was in spot and made everything right.\nWe walked up and there was no one to greet us, just at the point of being an annoyance a waiter walked by and said someone would be right with us. He had a fantastic smile and apologized for our wait, and we were seated very soon after.\nThat nice guy that greeted us at the door happened to be our waiter (save 1).  He was super nice and helpful. I asked to stray from the menu for a bit, by putting Brie cheese in my burger and he was totally accommodating.\nUnfortunately when the burger came out it was with the wrong cheese. :( He came to the table moments after the food did and was super apologetic and scooped it up. My correct burger wasn't far behind.\n\nVisit 2:\nHost was one of those people that wait for you to acknowledge that you're there. This is a huge pet peeve of mine, it's your job... greet me with a \"Hello\" and a \"2 for dinner?\". Don't make me greet you when I walk in. I'm not getting the paycheck.\nAnyway, we were sat. Because our waitress was busy the manager took our drink order. The service was slow this visit. Once we had the chance, we ordered our food and a milkshake at the same time from the waitress. Good showed up and the milkshake never did. Done with the meal and she came up and brought my hubby a new soda and asked me if I wanted a beer to go (yet the soda she brought him was in a glass - not sure if she expected him to slug it down while I got a to go beverage?).  \"No, but we did order a milkshake, were kind of wondering where that went.\" She apologized a D said she'd take care of it. Quite some time later, at the point where we were ready to just ask for the check (but we realized that we hadn't seen her since she brought the soda) she finally showed up with the milkshakes. We asked for the bill at that time, cuz we didn't want to wait any longer.\n\nFood:\nThe burgers were SUPER. And we highly recommend the Cheese Curds Fries and Cheddar Fries. The milkshakes were very tasty. And I am ALWAYS about a boozey milkshake, so I had the Chocolate with the Jack Daniels.\n\nThe seating area is nice with trees across the Strip from them (instead of looking at yet another resort). The music was a little loud but they had a GREAT selection of music!\n\nHopefully they're working on the training issue. Otherwise a great place!"

My other friend and I came back two days in a row, and the waitress actually remembered us. She even bought my friend a drink for his birthday. In a big city like Vegas, it was good to see that some of the workers in Sin City were actually friendly. The people at the Stripburger were great, and the atmosphere is conducive for a great time.\n\nMy 2 friends and I were there for a few hours and drank a lot, and because of their late night happy hour, it was inexpensive. All together our bills added up to less than $25. \n\nThe Stripburger is located outside across from the Wynn and next to the fashion show mall. It also has a great outside view of the strip.\n\nUnfortunately, the only food I ordered was the fries, but they were delicious, so I am sure the other food they had is just as great.\n\nAll in all, this joint was one of my favorite places on the strip. The prices are unbeatable and the staff is friendly. If I ever were to return to Las Vegas, I would be sure to come back to try some of their delicious food.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place!!!"

Beers were extremely cheap, about $2 for a Sierra Nevada, and a fairly decent selection compared to many Strip area bars. In addition, the Pickle Fries were delicious. Additionally looking at their regular prices for beer and food, they seem affordable during normal hours as well. The location is on the northern corner of the Fashion Show Mall, sort of Strip Front but not the greatest people watching venue of the Mall as it's around the corner a bit. Still it is hard to argue with the outdoor atmosphere!\n\nI can't speak to the quality of the burgers as I had just had a large meal, but I hear good things, so I feel safe enough giving this place 5 stars."

We both had cocktails but I don't remember which one I had.

First they brought out a to-go bag with only the salad... the barback went back and 5 min later brought out a turkey burger.  I asked if it was turkey w/pepper jack and he said he didn't know so asked the barternder.  She said yes.  ?  Then there wasn't silverware or condiments in the bag, so the barback had to go back and retreive those as well.\n\nSo, when I got back to the hotel to eat/work, there was no pepper jack.  I paid for cheese, certainly WAITED for cheese, but did I get cheese?  No, I got a mediocre burger so over-seasoned with pepper it was almost inedible.  (and I LOVE pepper, btw!)

He said I was about to have one of the best burgers ever. He was wrong. \n Had the bacon cheddar burger, rare and the Trio of fried pickle chips, fries and onion strings. \nBurger looked great, tasted very good but a few problems. Patty was rare as ordered but also cold in middle which equals muted flavors and not juicy. Bun was a bit gummy on outside(under-baked?), under toasted and became very thin and smashed while eating. Didn't fall apart, but felt like I had to race it to end. Waiter said food was better when the executive chef was in. Too bad he wasn't .  Trio was lame, could have come from any deep frier along any interstate. Pickle chips were something salty in a heavy batter. Onion strings were bland, could have been cardboard. Fries were no better. All served with a small ramikin of thing ranch like dressing."

The ahi burger , the shoestring sweet potato fries - WOW. \n\nIt was so amazing we came back a second time before leaving vegas and experienced the same amazing service and food all over again. \n\nWONDERFUL STAFF AND FOOD!!! Great job!\n\nOnly thing - kinda pricey for a burger place. then again isn't everything in vegas expensive?"

Getting a burger, drink, and check in this amount of time is extremely difficult for the servers at Stripburger.  I've had a bit better luck at the bar, but the table service servers over a three year period have really just not gotten it together.\n\nI'm pretty sure my trip today was our last.  We had to find a waitress three times.  Once, a drink was just subpar.  The second time was to replace the cold french fries that were delivered to the table.  The third was to get the check.\n\nWe poured our own water glasses as we were lucky to be sat next to the hostess stand where they keep pitchers for the waitresses.  I just stood up and grabbed glasses and poured them.\n\nGreen chili burger wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about.  Oh, and be forewarned - the menu may show the toppings but fail to also state that EVERY burger comes with tomato, lettuce, and mayo.  I had to get a second bottom bun to get rid of the nastiness of mayo.\n\nFriends ordered a Jack Arnold Palmer.  Don't bother.  The Jack Daniels was a short shot on the bottom of an Arnold Palmer, not mixed, and doesn't mix in well.\n\nFriends also ordered the cheese fries.  Be forewarned: there may be shredded cheddar on top, but it's a velveta like sauce under it.  Didn't taste great.\n\nLong and short, you're on the strip.  There's better food.  There are definitely better burgers in Vegas (usually off strip, burgers are kinda the food around here for some reason.)  Don't bother with this place."

After sitting down at a high top the waitress handed us a happy hour table tent informing us that every thing was one dollar.  All beers were a dollar and all alcohol was one dollar per ounce!  I told her, \"That's crazy!\"  She said, \"No it's not, it's great!\"  I asked why the give away prices and she informed us that people thought it was too cold on the deck so they were running the special on the deck only.  Coming from Colorado, we certainly did not mind, plus they had heaters hanging from the roof.  Drank a couple of doubles of Maker's for a price that I don't think I could drink for at home.  Even with these ridiculously priced drinks, the staff was all over it!

He said it was probably the best burger he has ever had. (and that is saying alot!) He said it was cooked perfect (medium) and he said the blue cheese with the onion straws were perfect.  Not too much and it was blue cheese crumbles, that melt onto the burger. (when you go to their website: http://lasvegasstripburger.com, the burger is the picture they have on there)\n-Veggie Burger: the best I have ever had!  Very moist, almost fell apart, but oh so good!  I would definitely get it again!\n-Fries: Their fries are enough for like 3 people.  They are really good!  You can tell they cut them in-house, with the skin on.  They taste really great!\n\nJust a great place to go and hang out.  During the spring/summer I am sure this place is SLAMMED!  It was a 60 degree day yesterday and they were busy.  Can't wait to go back and have some drinks too!\n\nOH!  There \"slogan\" is \"Burgers, Shakes & Cakes\".  They have \"baby\" cakes.

McDonald, KFC, The Counter, Cheesecake Factory.... all burgers are sooo good that ... when I bit into the burger I ordered here, I was very disappointed that it tasted like salt all over my mouth.\n\nOur waiter recommended this burger to me, so I ordered this one instead of my original choice on the menu. He said this burger he recommends only costs $1 more, but gives me more mushroom.. Okay, so the result is what I just described.\n \nMy bf was trying to be very nice to them and ordered another one for me, and we ended up paying for the crappy one they recommended to us as well. And yes, the second one we ordered was fine. \n\nSo I am giving them a three star instead of two or one. \n\nTIP - don't listen to the worker's recommendation. Just order the ones on the menu. You will get regular taste burgers."

It is located on the outside of the Fashion Show Mall.\n\nThe restaurant is outdoor seating but very comfortable even in 105 degree heat.  The misters and a breeze keep it very comfortable.  \n\nWe had eight people in our party and were seated immediately.  The specialty is their bleu cheese burger which 3 of us ordered and subsituted the regular burger for a veggie pattie.  It was very delicious.  The others said their regular burgers were great as well.\n\nThe burgers don't come with fries but a basket is more than enough for three and the sweet potato fries were great.  The onion rings were huge and delicious.\n\nWe also had the fried pickles which were very tasty.\n\nOur server was very friendly and knowledgeable about how much to order and what ingredients were included in the burger.  Substiutions were no problem.\n\nI really enjoyed the visit here and will probably go again if visting Vegas in the future."

They are pickles that are battered with japanese breadcrumbs and fried served up with ranch dressing. The ranch was a little runny, i like mine thicker and the pickles were a little too deep fried for me.\n\nTheir burgers are served medium, I prefer mine medium rare and it came out medium anyways but it was so damn juicy it didn't bug me, the flavor was very good. \n\nWe finished off with the Tall Strawberry Cake -- ok about as expensive as the burger itself but it was pretty good. Probably wont order it again but to describe it was pound cake compacted and covered with a icing served with a strawberry topping, nice and fresh tasting... :)"

When I was in Las vegas  like a week ago with my sisters, we were walking on the strip and we all had the same intention of wanting a good burger.  So I got out my iphone and located all the local burger joints and strip burger came up! We've been passing it for years ,but never bothered to even try it!   I looked at the reviews here on yelp through my phone and we wondered why so many people were giving this place such bad reviews. \nWith doubt in our minds, we were very hunger and craving burgers so we were just like f*&* -em let's try it for ourselves and see what we think.\nit's a pretty hip joint, it's all out doors,  the place has a great view of the strip,they got a full bar, the waiters and waitresses are pretty out going people, and so that was a plus.\nThe service here was great, out waitresses never let our glasses remain empty and brought out our food fast.She was very accommodating and helpful. No complaints here.\nWhat I really loved about this place is the fact that they use all natural non-frozen beef and ingredients! As a Organic/Natural consumer thats a major plus right there. Nothing beats natural! I ordered a cheeseburger with American, and shared their natural cut herb Garlic fries with my sister and I was astounded!  The burgers here are delicious and the beef patties are cooked to perfection. The meat is oozing with juiciness and so much  flavor and the produce such as the lettuce,tomato and onion were extremely fresh and complimented the burger greatly!  The Herb Garlic fries are to die for! Like I said,  they're Natural cut and  cooked to order and they are loaded with lots of garlic! You'll be scaring of the vampires for quite a while! As guy who loves a lot of garlic, Strip burger  is right on the money with these fries! They do them better than Gordon biersch!  I was excepting a mediocre Burger and meal at best, due to reading all these reviews! but dining here has taught me is that you cannot always rely on the opinions of others, because we're all different and have different perspectives. You gotta try things out for yourself in life and have your own opinion about it.   Stripburger is officially in my Top 5 burger joints and have some of the best burgers that I've ever had! \nNext time if you're in Las vegas on strip and  you want an outstanding  burger then  come to Stripburger and you're going to love it!"

Since we had a $100 gift certificate and the prices are reasonable, we had the freedom to over order and had a fair sampling of their offerings.\n\nWe started with three milkshakes, which obviously were a hit with the kids. The chocolate and strawberry were both good, but nobody really cared for the vanilla. It isn't too hard to blend ice cream with milk so no points were scored for this indulgent first course. My brother and I each had beer to go with our milkshake (bad timing) and my sister-in-law had a margarita that was shaken in one mason jar and served in another. The presentation was cute but because the drink tasted worse than a manufactured drink from a machine at Fat Tuesday's, all points were lost.\n\nDisappointingly, the burgers weren't that great either. We had their self-proclaimed famous blue cheese burger ($9.95) and the hickory burger ($9.95). The meat itself was alright, but they hadn't considered using a necessary moisture barrier between the meat and the bun. A juicy burger cooked on a flat top is bound to drip, so the best method for preventing this is to first set the patty on a paper towel after cooking to absorb the excess liquid, and then use some other ingredient (or ingredients) to form a layer between the meat and the bun so as to prevent the bun from getting soggy, such as lettuce, onions, etc. Despite the misleading picture on their website, the bottom half of the bun turned into a thin mush. The flavor of the meat and toppings were alright, but not good enough to compensate for the burger's shortcomings, so overall they weren't terribly successful.\n\nWe also ordered the \"atomic fries\" ($4.75) which weren't atomic at all, though it is still hard not to make fried potatoes tasty with the addition of processed nacho cheese and green chiles. I wouldn't order them again, but shamefully we still consumed most of what was in the basket. The highlight of the meal was another side, fried pickles ($3.95). I had my hesitations but I am always intrigued by interesting fried things so we tried them out. The were crunchy, vinegary, and salty, and were served with a ranch dipping sauce. I could have had these and the chocolate shake and been very pleased with my lunch.\n\nDespite the mediocrity of the meal, the prices were still quite reasonable for a casual Strip lunch and I can see why the place is usually busy. Gourmands on a food tour of Vegas certainly wouldn't eat here, but if you have friends in town on a budget that don't want to venture off the Strip, this is certainly a place a recommend. It's hard to find a sit down restaurant with such a prime location elsewhere that would cost you anything less than twice as much."

They promise to fufill you.\n\nCame here last night with my manager while we were in Vegas to take care of some work stuff... LOVE the fact that they are open till 2 AM (full on bar service as well). The music was a little loud for my liking, it was kinda hard to hear what my manger was saying to me, and we were sitting together at the same table! But I loved the outdoor space, and the lively feeling from around the area. Had a super friendly waitress last night, she was full of suggestions, and let us take our time ordering. My burger was SO FREAKIN TALL it was not even funny... you have to smash your burger down if you want to eat it all in one bite. However, I felt that even though the top was beautifully rounded out and a nice golden brown color, the insides of the bun were not toasted, and I found that I didn't really like that. I ordered my patty rare... and yes, it came out pink and raw, just the way I like it... however, I felt that I hit a cold spot somewhere in the middle of my patty, like they didn't heat it enough? Fleeting thoughts of undercooked raw food poisoning flirted across my mind and I continued to munch on my humungo-dang-diggy-dang-de-dang-de-dang-diggy-diggy burger. A little after halfway across my burger, the juices from the raw meat pretty much infiltrated my paper that wrapped around my burger, and soggify-ed the whole bun to mush, pretty much. I ended up tossing the top of my burger bun to cut some carbs out of my diet, and grubbing on the food inside individually.\n\nManager and I also ordered a side of Atomic Fries... guess I was looking for more from the name. Kinda expected some BOMB chili-cheese-fries, but with a \"mouth-on-fire\" feeling. Didn't happen. We got a basket full of fresh, hot, oily fries slathered on top with a healthy dose of creamy nacho-esque cheese, sprinkled with some jalapeno peppers. WHAT?!?! Are you serious? Is that it?!?! Kinda disappointed...\n\nBut for sure, if you're hungry, the burger definitely hits the spot to help fill you up. Not sure if it's worth the $10 bucks paid for it... but I understand everything is overpriced on the strip, and frankly, I thought the burger was pretty good overall... I'll just order it medium, or well cooked next time."

I really didn't think all the times I walked past this spot that it could compete with Burger Bar at Mandalay, however, my taste buds thought otherwise.\nSituated in a small corner on the outter-crest of the Fashion Show mall Stripburger lives up to the name by offering some excellent comfort burgers at their smaller yet, well maintained location.  The location offers a great view of the Wynn and makes you feel cozy just sitting there; onto the food.\n\nCalamari was decent; dipping sauce made it\nThe Fiesta Burger w/spicy chorizo was the special; it was fantastic \nI usual order my burgers medium-rare; it was spot on like I cook em' at home\nThe sweet potato fries were delicious, can't wait to try the atomic fires\nThe service was great and the bar was packed with people; made for a great atmosphere.\nOverall, I thought it was awesome and can't wait to go back; go now!"

Well, there were...but they were off work at the time. ;) \n\nOur friend works here so he hooked it up for us. We tried a bit of everything and it was all great. Fried pickles, sweet potato fries, mushroom/swiss burger, turkey burger, bloody mary's and extra-delish margaritas. YUM. \n\nAfter a night out in Vegas, this was the perfect place to recover. And it looks like tons of other people think the same way, everyone looked a bit hungover. \n\nIt's patio-only.....but don't worry, they have misters and plenty of shaded areas. I loved being able to people-watch here sitting high up on our barstools. \n\nFor Vegas locals and tourists alike, this is a must-try burger joint for day or night. \n\nAsk to sit in Justin's section and tell him his Texas friends sent ya!"

I went ahead and ordered a veggie burger because their name is \"strip burger\" and I'm always on a hunt for delicious creative veggie burgers. Their veggie burger was not mushroom or soy based like the other ones but with brown rise, seeds, and nuts! It tasted kind of like potatos but it was very fulfilling. There were no unique sauce so i used the regular ketchup and mustard which is fine but I couldn't stop thinking how much High Fructose Corn Syrup I was putting into my mouth because most brand ketchup is filled with that crap. But the burger in general was good but nothing special. \nI also ordered a \"three some\" which included fried pickles, fries, and onion fries. the onion fries were stringy, sweet and hard to eat but yummy. wish they were in my veggie burger! it would've been delicious with it! the fries were regular but good and my friend and i both enjoyed the deep fried pickles! a weird sensation of crunchy pickles. :D \nI would definitely recommend this place for a quick lunch stop!"

When I went inside to the restroom, I noticed that there was indoor seating too. However, it is great for dining outside while taking in the Vegas atmosphere during the warmer months. \n\nStripburger advertises a lot of freshness behind their food, such as never-frozen patties and freshly cut fries. The bacon and cheddar burger is pretty good. I've had better patties but this was pretty satisfying. The veggie burger has a patty made from brown rice. It is very well-seasoned and delicious! Burgers averaged from $8-11, which I consider pretty cheap given it's Vegas. \n\nThe cheddar fries came with a creamy sauce and shredded cheddar cheese on top. It was a great guilty pleasure. Adult shakes are always fun to drink but can be over the top because the burgers are pretty heavy. \n\nOverall, this was a very chill atmosphere with good food. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars because it's more than okay but I can't declare myself as a fan. Nonetheless, our helpful waitress, constant refills, and the satisfying meal pushed it to a 4!"

I was never a fan of blue cheese until I tried this burger.  I'm telling you it is a must try.  After about my 10th burger I learned they use grass fed beef.  How 'bout that?  \n\nSo now I take all my friends here when they come into town.  If they take my advice and order the blue cheese cheeseburger, they leave never looking at burgers the same way.  \n\nIf you go during December or January they have $1 \"you call it\" drinks at the bar.   Ridiculous pre-game where even bums can buy rounds.  \n\nAmy tends bar like no other.  She greets you, learns your name and introduces you to others; she brings people together.   She is a huge reason that I appreciate this gem of an establishment.  She made me feel welcome from day one, later I discovered the blue cheese cheeseburger, but with such service I would frequent the place anyway.  All I can say is thank you Amy."

However, I love sitting outside RIGHT on the strip on a beautiful day, and getting in and out for parking/driving is a breeze... so, yeah... solid 4 stars!\n\nThey've started giving you the big beers in glass cups which I'm not a huge fan of, but I find if you ask, they'll give you a branded plastic one to pour into, and then keep (and if you're like me, you'll get 'service for 12' in no time :-) ) --- bonus is they are also dishwasher safe so far!\n\nSo go.... Go for the sunshine and beautiful outdoor seating in a primo location on the strip (anywhere else will cost you far more in food/drinks for such a spot)... Go for a burger, a big beer, some cheese fries, and some fried pickles.... I'll be sad when this place inevitably gets changed into something that charges more."

I love me some burgers so I jumped at the chance to check it out. First off, I must say that I was very impressed with the location. Outdoor seating just outside of the Fashion Show Mall and right across from the Wynn, it was the perfect setting for some good times and food with friends.\n\nLooking at the menu she was right on the dot...nothing over 10 bucks. Their favorite blue cheese burger caught my eye, but I noticed that their other burgers had toppings that I wanted to add on to that burger like bacon ( I mean come on...if you are gonna do a burger, do it right and go all out). The waitress accommodated me and said I could add whatever I wanted to my burger which was awesome. I must say that I was pretty impressed with the burger once it arrived...nice and juicy and cooked perfectly. The sides were great. Fries were crisp yet the only problem I had were the onion rings...way too skinny and limp (as women...we tend not to like that). All in all, Stripburger is a great place to chill, relax, listen to some good music and eat good burgers.\n\n+ 1 Star: For having Chimay under 10 bucks...hell yeah!!\n\n-1 Star: Taking down the stripper pole located in the middle of restaurant...how do they expect anyone to work off all that food...it ain't called Stripburger for nothin'"

I ordered the jalapeno popper burger and he couldn't choose between the BBQ Whiskey burger or the Blue burger so he opted for the sampler of three sliders so he could try them both. He also got a shake since he used to love it. The burgers should have been prepared medium, they were medium well at best. The buns were dry, the meat crumbled. The fried cheese on my burger tasted like flour and grease. I pulled it off so it would be edible. His BBQ burger came with mayo and really threw off the flavor. At least, the shake was decent.\n\nThe waitress never asked how our meal was, but she was pretty prompt refilling drinks and taking our order. $40 later, we were wishing we went to In & Out and bought doubles for everyone in line.

After she tasted it, she said it was not a compromise, it was a great burger. \n\nI had the bleu cheese burger, and it was cooked perfectly (medium, as ordered) and every bite was delicious. \n\nWe shared an order of garlic fries.

It seemed like once we got our food, we didn't see them for a while, and it took some time for us to finally get our check. Still, it was a good choice to come here.

The reason for my 2 stars today is all due to the service I just experienced for our server JILLIAN.  Where do I even start!?\n\nAs we were being seated by the sweet hostess, I noticed a young blonde girl sweeping by our table.  After being seated and looking at the menu for 3 or so minutes, that same girl who was sweeping came to our table.  She NEVER gave us her name, just asked what we wanted to drink.  Now I have been a server and a bartender at many places and I know the Universal Steps of Service!! Always start by being polite and saying Hello, my name is.... Come on! Common Sense!!! Anyway, she took our drink order and came back with it.  I had water my friend had an Iced Tea.  She forgot to bring a lemon with it.  That is also common sense.  She didn't try to up sell beverages.  Normally you ask, would you like to start off with a pepsi, ice tea, or an ice cold beer etc. but this was not even offered to us.  She then took our order and walked off.  I noticed that there was only one silverware wrap-up on the table and she did not notice it.  I waited to see if she would catch that.  Our food was delivered by a food runner and that food runner didn't catch the 1 silverware roll up either so I stood up and grabbed one from another table.  The food runner, also female said nothing to us. She did not ask if we had everything, if we needed anything, or to even enjoy our meal.  Jillian, was no where to be found.  We had our food for about 5 minutes before she even came over to see if we were okay or if the food was cooked correctly.  Well, my fries were a bit cold but I let it slide.  Our drinks ran low, so I pushed my glass toward the end of the table with hopes she would see it.  As she stood with her arms crossed against the wall I started to get mad.  Everybody knows when a drink is half full you refill it, but mine was completely empty. As she stood against the wall looking around I wondered how she did not \"see\" this.  As she walked to the back to avoid us I stood up and POURED MY OWN WATER from a pitcher that was by us.  YES, I poured my own water.  As I did this a server named ALEX came over and he was so polite and sweet.  He asked us if we were okay and if we needed anything.  He grabbed my friend more ice tea and he then bussed our table and took the dishes we weren't using all while our own sever Jillian watched him.  She is something else.  \n\nBeing a server is a team effort.  I would be livid if I had to pick up the slack for a lazy server who clearly was hating her life that day and who showed she did not want to be there.  So, with that said, I asked Alex what her deal was.  He said she was upset because her guest had been stiffing her or tipping poorly all day.  WELL I WONDER WHY!! Now comes the best part, she asked if we wanted desert then dropped our check off.  Her name was on the check so that is the only way I got her name.  I asked for a manager and relayed all of this to her as well.  The manager was extremely responsive and helpful.  She offered to do something for us but I said no.  I was not looking for a hand out just good service.  I told her that Jillian's poor attitude and lack of serving skills makes their place look bad and I just wanted to address the issue so Jillian's attitude could be adjusted for her next set of patrons.  Our bill was $29.00 so we left Jillian $3.00.  That is more than she deserved clearly.  Since I am in the Vegas service industry I just couldn't leave nothing.  I get it, we work for tips and that is our sole income.  But as I walked out I did hand Alex a $20 tip for being so polite and helpful.  He deserved it.  Now, the kicker of this whole experience..... as we left Jillian yelled out, \"ADIOS\" in a snide tone.   Are you kidding me!! How old are you!? So I asked again for the same manager and told her about that as well.  That is seriously uncalled for.  If I was Jillian's manager I would have sent her home to adjust her attitude.  I hope you are reading this Jillian because this is NOT how your treat your customer unless you want to get getting Zero to 10%tips.   Take some notes from Alex!\n\nAll in all I do love this spot.  The food is yummy and I haven't had a bad server experience until tonight.  Yes, I will return but you best believe I will not sit in Jillian's section again.  I'll save my $20 for the next server."

Price-wise, burger-wise, side-wise, everything-wise, Stripburger is hands down the best you're going to get, if you're willing to venture down to the north end of the fashion show mall.  \n\nAll of the burgers are made fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order, and Stripburger offers a number of excellent specialty burgers that are to die for.  The standard cheeseburger (or even better, the bacon cheeseburger) is outstanding, but if you really want to be blown away, go for the southwest burger - chipotle mayo, fried onion straws, and bacon - it is my favorite burger on the menu.  The green chili cheeseburger is a close second, and only rivaled by the green chili cheeseburgers from New Mexico.  \n\nThe sides, especially the cheddar fries, are outstanding and served in a generous portion that are made to share.  The beer is always cold, and the mixed drinks are made strong.  The burgers might not be as cheap as fast food, but they are certainly cheaper than some of the fancier gourmet burgers places elsewhere on the strip, so before you clamor to Burger Bar or Holstein's, give Stripburger a shot - you won't be disappointed."

Apparently it does. And it's in the form of Stripburger.\n\nIt's located right across from the Wynn in the shopping center which was perfect for my friends and I. We walked over one day before dinner and were pleasantly surprised by everything. Our only complaint about the burger is that it couldn't hold itself together. Everything was dripping everywhere and falling apart. My bun was soggy before I even got halfway through the burger. Regardless, it was delicious. The sweet potato fries were good but there was a little too much of the sugar/salt mix on it and I had to scrape it off. \n\nThe portions are huge! The burger was probably around the size of my face. And if you order a gourmet burger, then it comes with fries. That factors to be about $20 with tip. Definitely a solid deal if you're in Vegas. \n\nStripburger lost the 0.5 stars because the burger couldn't hold up. It's one of the things that really stresses me out when I'm eating and if the burger was stacked properly, I feel like everything would have been okay. I bumped it up to four because of the value."

We arrived at the strip around 6 ish and believe it or not we still found a quick parking space at the Fashon Show Mall, which is not easy usually. I ordered the beer mojito, it was different. I wouldn't order it again eventhough I'm a fan of beer, check, fan of lime, check and mint, check, but just not all together. I also went with the famous Blue Cheese burger. Maybe I was imagining RedRobins Blue Ribbon but this while being good wasnt what I'd call world famous. If I had it to do over again I'd ordered it without the tomato which became soggy with the juice from the meat. and without the onion straws which too became soggy. yuck. I pulled them out and ate what I could. Now for the GARLIC FRIES, YUM! too full however to even put a dent into them, and sadly you just can't reheat fries. Plus who wants to walk around with a doggy bag up & down the strip?   MY bf went with the southwest burger - NOT on the menu. chipotle mayo, bacon and pepperjack cheese. He loves anything with heat but he still had to add tabasco so its not hot at all. and he went w/ the cheese fries.also delish. Had we known the fry buckets were so big we would have shared and still not finished  them by half!  Its a pretty good place, chilled out relaxed atmosphere. cool location b/c its one of those outdoor only places and the weather was perfect. I'd go back.  :) but i cant wait to try el segundo sol its attached to - awesome vibe indoors, kinda reminded me of san antonio a lil bit. (ah the best city in the world!)  and Maggiano's.

            "review": "Sometimes a guy just wants a good burger. Simple aspects: nothing fancy, no extras, and never a long wait. And in the competitive burger environment that is the Las Vegas Strip, Stripburger is one of those places. Whether you have a larger party after a long night (or morning) of Las Vegas shenanigans, or you have brought the wee ones to your \"work conference\", or you simple need a #table4two and a good meal, Stripburger is the answer.\n\nLas Vegas will always be famous for its people watching. Stripburger is no different. Perched on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fashion Show, patrons get the walking traffic coming and leaving the mall area, the trickling down from older Las Vegas, and the usually enthusiastic crowds from the Wynn and Encore resorts. Entertainment like this is not always necessary but a welcome feature. They have outdoor dining, which is fun. The misters run throughout the day, and that corner gets a good amount of shade to deal with the desert sun. \n\nThe burgers itself are delicious. Raging steadily from $9-$11, the burgers are a good portion and have varied ingredients including melted mushrooms, chipotle mayo, and Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. I usually order the Blue Cheese Burger and add bacon. Yes, I cheat by adding the bacon, but do you blame me? The Mushroom Cheddar Burger and the Whiskey BBQ Burger are also hits at our table. \n\nBut Stripburger gets underestimated with their sides ($5-$8). Their garlic herb fries, sweet potato fries, and the garlic strings are appetizing. I order mine extra crispy. They even do a threesome which combines a couple choices and some pickle fries. The milkshakes ($5) are very good as well, although a little on the thicker side. But as other reviewers have mentioned, its consistency is due to the Las Vegas heat. It melts just a tad bit slower. The butterscotch and the banana shakes are my personal favorite. Go to those if you have a sweet craving.\n\nBecause of the size of the Las Vegas Strip, most food choices are made on convenience. But I advise that you make a trip to Stripburger in the Fashion Show Mall. Its ambiance, affordable Strip prices, and darn good food make it a crowd pleaser and go-to stop from visitors and locals alike."

It's a little pricy, $100 for 4 people, 4 beers, 1 soda & food. Having to order fries on the side is a bust, but the burger of the day came with fries. If I would have known that we would've cut an order of fries, cause the burger filled me up & I didn't need fries! But I would for sure go back! It was delicious."

Needless to say she was amazing, polite, and genuinely cared about our experience. We never had an empty glass and she did not pressure us to order alcohol either. \n\nWe ordered two shakes (fudge chocolate, amazing), a side of sweet potato fries (solid, tangy fry sauce and sugar), and two burgers. I had the green chili burger and my SO had the whiskey bbq. They were both pretty tasty and you could taste the meat without all the toppings overpowering it. \n\nThe food came out very quickly and the whole experience was wonderful. The hosts/bussers/servers/food runners were all smiley and welcoming, which honestly does a whole lot more than you'd expect.\n\nNext time we come by, we'll make it a night time dinner to people watch and enjoy the atmosphere. So for two burgers, two shakes, and fries, our total was slightly north of $40, and we still tipped 25% because Rebecca was just awesome."

The wow factor of this place is their burger and fries. \n\nFirst the burgers. I have had tried them all but the mexican burger is the best. I was introduced to this a while back before it was even on the menu. Chipotle Mayo, pickled red onions, Jalapeno,  Cotilla Cheese, Cilantro, and a roasted Jalapeno stabbed into the top of the bun with a toothpick. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. You must get their green homemade \"Chuy\" sauce with it. It is spicy and a delight to the taste buds. If Amy(great bartender) is there she serves it with every Mexican burger.\n\nNext up is the Garlic fries, lots of fresh garlic spices. Big enough to share but just like grandma when you got close to her pies you will be slapping an intruders hand. \n\nNot only are the libations cheap for happy hr, full bar is $1 after nine. Their regular fries and sliders are half off. All of the seating is outside but they have heaters for when it's cold and fans for the warm dessert summers. I have never once had subpar service at a table or the bar."

Not quite as big as a burger from Island, and not as tiny as one from In N Out either. Also, I order a side of fries -- half sweet potato fries and half garlic and herb.  I asked for a side of the chef's special dippin' sauce with them on the side too. The atomic fries, which are topped with cheddar cheese and sliced jalapenos are great too. Just ask and you can mix what variety of fries you'd like. Good food, drinks, good location to people watch on the strip!"

I heard this place can get pretty packed but it wasnt a weekend so it wasnt too bad.\nI realize its Vegas and they are trying to be hip and all that but the music was blasting WAY too loud. Actually I dont mind the loud music, but it made it almost impossible to hear the waitress and vice versa. She evidently didnt hear part of our order so it took a while before everything we ordered actually arrived to our table.\nThe bacon cheeseburger was pretty big and tasted pretty good. Not great but pretty much what you get at similar places for the same price. The garlic herb fries were good and one order is plenty to share with another person or two.\nAs we were seated, we walked through a conversation/arguement between a manager and waitress. Sounded like confusion and wrong orders going out are not unusual. Maybe it was just an off night.\nIf you have kids, I would suggest considering the age and appetite of the child before ordering off of the kids menu. For an 8 year old, the kids cheeseburger was pretty small.\nThe manager was really nice and attentive. He asked if we would like a heat lamp next to our table and he promptly brought one over and lit it for us.\nLeaving took a little while also due to the waitress bringing us somebody elses check. The manager saw me looking around for the waitress and came over and got us the right check.\nI think a lot of people would give less stars with the problems that we had but,  like I said before, it may have been an off night. The employees are friendly so I will give them the benefit of the doubt."

We ordered a side of fries which could have fed all of Cesar's Palace.  Huge!  Finish this and expect heart trouble!  On the down side, the service was a little spotty and the prices were a little more then I think they should have been.

You could walk into Shake Shack, Fatburger, Epic Burger, etc and have a similar experience. It seems that Stripburger is a niche restaurant designed (name) to cater to the Vegas crowds.\n\nAnyway, we stopped in for lunch one day during a recent vacation. We didn't want to sit outside in the heat so we opted to dine inside. \"Inside\" is actually the backroom area of the adjacent restaurant. There are a few tables in an area designed to actually be a prep area. There is NO attempt to hide this fact either. No dressing up the area or anything like that. That didn't bother me though. It was cool and quiet.\n\nI ordered a regular burger with fries and a coke. The burger was pretty good. It was well proportioned and seasoned to perfection. The fries were tasty and big enough for us to share. (even though we ordered two separate baskets) The bill came to a little over $10 which is pretty standard for these types of places.\n\nI probaby wouldn't eat at Stripburger again given the plethoria of choices in Vegas but I encourage you to check it out nonetheless."

The manager came right over and apologized and let us know that there was going to be a short wait because of this happening. He stayed and talked with us and made sure that we were happy while waiting for our food. \n\nThis is an open air restaurant and so be prepared to dress according to the weather. There are nice views of the strip and it is fun people watching as you eat your food."

If I wasn't functioning at the brain level just before coma I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the burger as much as I did at the time, but ignorance is bliss.\n\nOf course the highlight of my trip to Stripburger had to be my friend ordering the Shrimp Bucket, which was described as \"Peel n' Eat Shrimp\" (was she still drunk?).  One of the most important rules I live my life by is to never order anything on a menu in which they spell and \" N' \".  Second of all seafood in the desert at cheap restaurants with \"strip\" in the name is never a good choice as my friend soon learned.  The shrimp was crazy looking and apparently crazy tasting, although I hope to never find out myself.\n\nLong story short, Stripburger is step above McDonald's a step below   TGI Fridays, and I honestly would rather eat shrimp from Long John Silvers"

It is also an outdoor setting, so beware come summer time!! There are about 10 burgers to choose from, and all are about $10 each, without fries! So, I'm guessing that's pretty pricey for just a burger. \n\nI recently tried the Southwest chipotle burger, and the burger was A-ok!! I'd have to say the famous blue cheese burger is what keeps me coming back!! Another must-try are the onion strings!! An order can be shared until it is all gone! =D\n\nThe chocolate shake is also magnificent! You can just taste and feel the chocolate bits melt in your mouth!! \n\nI wish there was a happy hour, or maybe there is? One that I don't know of yet!"

            "review": "I ordered the southwest burger and it was very good. It had a bit of a buttery, spicy flavor to it. I ordered the side of garlic herb fries. First off, we didn't need the appetizer, that's how many fries they bring. The burgers are huge as it is. But they basically brought me a medium sized mixing bowl of fries. That being said, they're very good  and very garlicky. \n\nMy bf got the gourmet bison burger. He said it was even better than the burger at BurGR. \n\nWe got the onion rings as an appetizer, and like I said we really didn't need it. They were also very good though. Extremely crunchy on the outside and did NOT  get that slimey onion on the inside thing going on. honestly, just to die for. \n\nThey have more options as far as burgers compared to Ramsey's. And the taste is on par if not better. However, it took for frickin ever to get our food. Don't know if that is normal or not. But honestly. Worth the wait"

Mostly to kitty-capture.\n\nNonetheless, I ordered their veggie burger and some sweet potato fries. It seems like its mostly outdoor seating, which wasn't fun cause it was a windy night, but they try their best to accommodate you with windbreaking see-through walls put up and outdoor heaters going, wasn't too shabby. Place was very clean and the waitress was nice. \nThe veggie burger was made out of some sort of rice and peppers, which was super good and not like anything I've had before. Unlike most burger places that just slap a Boca burger on a bun for the vegetarians, this place thoroughly impressed me in that aspect. \nThe fries were super tasty, I don't know what they did to them but it was like magic.\n\nAlas, after our delicious meal there was no little kitten in sight, and with heavy hearts we left our number with the waitress to call if they ever caught it. Poor kitty!"

You actually sit outside with a roof over your head and some tarp like windows. They kept it pretty warm with the portable propane heaters that they had between the tables. The burgers were excellent! Fries were good. All the food we got was extremely tasty. Service was very good and efficient. No complaints at all. If you want a great burger at a fairly reasonable cost then this place is worth a try. I will go back again next time."

Anything with a seat that served bread would have done. LUCKILY for us there was a burger joint within walking distance, or rolling distance (it was really that close). \n\nLet's get to the chase, the burgers are solid! Beef patty were  well grilled, flavorful and perfectly cooked. Since it was my first time here, I ordered the sliders (3 different mini burgers) and the threesome (pickle fries, fries, and thin onion thingies). Pickle fries are awesome like most yelpers stated, fries are fries, but I didn't care too much for the thin deep fried onions. \n\nIf you like spicy dips, get the \"chewey\" dip. Not sure what's in there but it has a sharp punch that leaves you wanting water asap.  Those who can't handle spicy foods need not to try.\n\nHighly recommended if you feel like a good affordable Vegas burger. My wife says, and I quote \"... I think this is the best burger I've ever had!\""

We immediately ordered drinks and onion rings as we waitied for the rest of our partie to arrive.  It seemed to take the bartender forever to pour 2 freaking beers!  The beers arrived after the onion rings.  The waitress was great!  Definately will be back again."

I've tried many different items on their menu and everything is delicious. My personal favorites are the fried pickles, buffalo chicken sandwich, and sweet potato fries. Their shakes are the best, I recommend strawberry banana, and you can add alcohol & still tastes great. The outdoor seating is great for a nice lunch in the sun or some evening drinks when the sun is going down."

It had fried onions on top and red onions on the bottom.  The bun is made outta some gourmet style bread.\n\nI'd give this place 5 stars, but since you have to pay extra for fries (only $2 for a HUGE basket you and your friends probably won't finish) it gets 4. Still worth it though."

It's a pretty loud outdoor seating area on the corner of the strip so be prepared to talk loudly to the rest of your party. My server Nathan was very attentive and friendly. He suggested a new menu item and described it thoroughly. Sounded delicious but included stuff I don't include in my diet so I ordered off the menu. I have to say it was a pretty darn good burger. I ordered a turkey mushroom cheddar burger with a side of garlic fries. Yummy! The turkey burger was very tasty, not dried out like it can be if over cooked, and flavorful. I was impressed with the butter grilled bun and hefty slice of melted cheddar cheese.\nThe garlic fries were awesome. Freshly cooked to order. They use fresh minced garlic and parsley. I like my fries a bit more salty but these were great.\nOverall a great lil burger joint. I little on the loud side regarding atmosphere but still a fun place to eat. Check it out"
