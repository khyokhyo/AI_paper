            "review": "We came here for dinner a few nights ago with family. The decor is fun, and the staff is friendly.\n\nRed and White wine is included with dinner, I can't drink because i'm pregnant, but the family enjoyed it. The man says that the free red wine was good. :)\n\nAlso included with dinner is soup or salad, and garlic bread. The garlic bread was good, nice and warm. I really liked the dinner salad, but I had to pick some of the stuff out before I could eat it (no lunch meat or unpasteurized cheese), it was perfectly dressed though. The soup was run of the mill, nothing memorable.\n\nI had spaghetti with meat sauce and a side of italian sausage. It tasted good, not great, but there was barely any sauce on it, and i'm the kind of girl that likes a lot of sauce with her pasta so I can dip bread in it. There was always a different person waiting on the table, never the same person twice, and they didn't come around that often, so I didn't get a chance to ask for more sauce. However, besides that, the staff was very friendly when they did come around, and the guy playing the accordion was adorable.\n\nAfter dinner everyone gets free cappucino, ( yet another thing i can't have, WTF man, it's a conspiracy!) the family all enjoyed it.\n\nWhen we go back to Vegas I don't think we'll head back here, overall it was just ok."

Tons of pictures of celebrities on the wall but I'm lucky if I can name 1 in 10 of them.\n\nThe menu is limited and posted on boards on the wall.  You pretty much just pick whatever item you want and it comes with soup or salad, beverage including house wine, and a cappucino thing after dinner.  Most meals are about $22 and include everything I just mentioned, so pricewise its a good deal.\n\nI've always found the food to be good but I usually just stick to the pasta dishes.\n\nIf you're a high maintenance or trendy type of person this is not the place for you - you'll be unhappy as soon as you walk in the door.  If you're laid back and like things a little retro or different then you'll really appreciate this place."

This was a place we always took guests whenever they were visiting and a place we have to visit now when we're in town (used to be locals). Favorite things about this place are: unlimited free house wine and Gordie, the accordian player. When they have the wild mushroom ravioli on special (not a regular item), that is a MUST get. We called ahead this trip and the chef agreed to make it special for us. I couldn't be happier!"

The place is dark and dingy, it was dusty and nasty. there was actually a toilet seat hanging on the wall above our head that was so gross. the so called cappuccino is hot chocolate from nestle, nothing tasted authentic, you will have better luck at the Olive Garden. The wine is cheap vinegar that they refill after every use. I don't know how this place is still open."

He was definitely right. It was on the dot 5pm and there was a crowd. Menu is simple, prices are fair and the food is so good (especially after food court food from the casinos!). We will definitely be back here on our next trip to Las Vegas. (For dessert I highly suggest the Spumoni ice cream cake!)"

            "review": "My wife and I hit Battista's every trip to Vegas, and will in the future.  \n\nLet's keep everything in perspective.  It's a $25 meal, all-you-can-drink wine included, a 2-minute walk from the strip.  And you get what you pay for in Vegas, just like everywhere else.  With that in mind:\n\nThe highlights:  \n\n- The food isn't Gordon Ramsay quality, but it's not bad either.  The lasagna is better than a lot of restaurants I've had, and the Chicken Rio is worth trying.  Tons of garlic bread helps to soak up the wine so you can still do enough math to leave a tip.\n\n- The wine isn't really that great.  But I'm usually hammered from gambling and drinking all day, so it's not like I'm looking for a $50 bottle anyway.  It's definitely quantity over quality here, but you're not going to even notice it after you polish off the first bottle.\n\n- The service is average to above average.  I've never had a problem there.\n\n- RESERVATIONS.  It's usually crowded, so save yourself a long wait and call ahead.  \n\n- The atmosphere is laid back and old school Vegas.  It's dark, there's stuff all over the walls.  Whoever decorated this place probably isn't even allowed in the Venetian, but it's a nice change from most upscale strip restaurants.\n\n- Pay the old accordion player to play you a song.  He doesn't look like he'll be around a whole lot longer.  \n\nOnce, I didn't want to leave half a bottle of wine (can't waste that stuff, you know), so I asked for a to-go cup.  They gave me one, no questions asked.\n\nOnly in Vegas."

            "review": "The good: all-inclusive pricing, including house wine.\n\nThe bad: mediocre attempt at the dishes (veal piccata and eggplant parmesan) we ordered.\n\nThe meal began with a delicious bowl of garlic bread, accompanied by a poor choice of white wine (too sweet) and an adequate-but-uninteresting red. Soup or salad--one choice each and no other choices on dressing except the italian. Entrees were accompanied by a little plate of pasta (penne) and some underwhelming sauce. \n\nBecause the pricing was inclusive (hers $28; mine $32), the hit wasn't bad. But the quality was middling, at best. If we return, I'll look for something (perhaps lasagne?) more in their wheelhouse. But we'll likely just skip this in the future."

I also enjoyed the convenience of the \"pre-fixe\" menu, in that you get the wine, bread, soup/salad and entree included with every dinner. The only downfall to this is if you aren't hungry enough for all of the food that's coming your way. It would be nice to be able to order just an entree or soup/salad, but I the current system works as well. \n\n  The bread was AMAZING!!! The eggplant parm was AMAZING, even though it didn't have spaghetti included, but I wasn't hungry enough for that anyway. \n\n  Stay away from the white wine if you like things that taste good. It's all about that red wine. Unless, of course, the red wine carafe is empty, in which case drink up that free booze!\n\n  Overall, a great experience. Loved the accordion player. And cheap booze at the bar! $6 whiskey and coke!!!"

My step-dad loves this place and always raves about it. The food is good, but nothing amazing. The only thing I don't like are the massive portions and the $20+ per dish pricing. The free wine and bread is nice. Also, Love the little old man playing accordian. Funny guy and he can probably play anything you ask on the accordian. For us, since we are all from Indiana, he played \"Back home again in Indiana\" which if you know anything about the Indy 500 or Indiana, is a little piece of Hoosier tradition. Cracks me up that my step dad said he has been coming to Vegas for probably 25-30 years and it is the same little old guy playing accordian."

I tried using salt and the grated cheese to give it some kind of flavor but it was no good.  We were given a booth in a corner and told to sit there.  No one helped pull out the table so we could get behind the table.  We were able to avoid the accordion player but heard others who were not so lucky.  The cappuccino was not even warm.  Heard the people next to us say that even Ragu spaghetti sauce tastes better and we agreed.  We were so looking forward to eating here, but after last week, we will never go back.

It would have been a lot better if the hostess told me that crucial fact when I put my name on the wait list.

Get a reservation if you really want to try it.\nGot the pomodoro and the sauce was runny and watered down. My friends got the lasagna which is massive and the eggplant parm which was ok. The white wine tasted watered down, and didn't even smell like wine.\n\nThe good: unlimited wine. The red wine was actually ok, it's more sweet than dry. The salad and garlic bread was bomb. The \"cappuccino\" (it's hot chocolate with a shot of caffeine and whip cream) was good. The portions are big. It's a fun atmosphere (the accordian guy can't really play well but bless his heart he's adorable!) Food service is fast. \n\nDon't think I'm coming back, or recommending this place to friends or guests unless they want the unlimited wine."

You have to come here for dinner.\n\nHole in the Wall is a Vegas staple.  Been here for years.  How many?  Not sure, look it up.\n\nComfy intimate Italian restaurant close to everything, serving up pasta and meat classics.  The menu is on the wall, and there is nothing I could not recommend.  Anything will fill your belly up with love and comfort.  Although, the veal is phenomenal.  Poor little baby cow is a tasty little bugger.\n\nAll meals come with the famous unlimited white and red wine, bread, and soup or salad.  I switch it up between soup and salad.  I'm a gambler.\n\nAnd when you are done gorging on your Italian feast, complimentary cappuccino.  SUPER sweet, piled high with fresh whipped cream to wash away the red sauce and pasta and cheese (so much cheese), and whatever else you may have stuffed in your  mouth.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? GORDY the accordion player.  Sweet man who comes around to each table, asks you where you're from, and then plays a song for you while waiting for his tip.  He is adorable.  i want to put him in my pocket.\n\nRemember: 8 deadly sins.  You gotta come here."

            "review": "Everyone seems to love Batista's, and there must be a reason. But I sure didn't see many reasons to like it last night. It was my first visit---I went with out-of-town relatives who absolutely love the place. \n\nThe pluses first: The atmosphere is great, it's vintage Vegas and there are photos galore of everyone who is or was anyone. I love the carafes of house red and white wine they give you, and constantly refill. It's house wine, yes, but I really liked the white chablis. They also give you big baskets of garlic bread, and the Italian salad was quite good.\n\nNow the minuses: My biggest problem with Batista's last night was the wait staff's attitude and the feeling I got of being rushed. Everything they did and said---and how they said it---screamed \"We want to move you out of here as fast as we can.\" No smiles from the waiters, nothing friendly about them, just all business get-you-out-of-here attitudes. Our waiter brought an armload of salads to the table (yes, stacked on his arm), and said \"Anyone here who doesn't want a salad?\" We all did, and he dealt them out around the table, just like a 21 dealer. He took our orders and soon our food arrived.\n\nI had steak pizzaiola. My plate was 3/4 steak covered in sauce, and 1/4 creamed spinach. It was mass of liquid. Frankly, it looked unappetizing, but the steak was very good. I didn't eat the spinach, though, I couldn't get past how it looked. They never brought my side order of pasta (the menu says you get soup or salad, garlic bread, a side of pasta, and cappuccino). I didn't realize they'd forgotten it until I was done eating because I felt so rushed. They dropped capuccinos on the table and the rush feeling really started. That's when I realized there's no dessert menu! I guess they don't want guests lingering over dessert. Since the family in our group hadn't seen each other in a couple of years, we were all talking over our coffee, but they kept trying to get us out of there! So we finally obliged them.\n\nMy dinner was $29.95, and I've certainly had far better for that price or less. Although the food was good, the presentation (at least of my dish) was just awful, and forgetting the pasta side just shouldn't have happened. And the truth is they weren't really all that busy. There was no line out the door, and I'm not sure anyone had to wait for a table if they didn't have a reservation. Normally I would have had a better steak, like a ribeye or a NY strip, but those were $39.95 on their menu, and I don't pay that much for a steak that's just a steak (it's not like the menu said it's kobe or even angus). I can't speak at all for the past dishes since I didn't have any, but those who had pasta in my party liked it. \n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed. To me, it seems like so many people come to Batista's (perhaps just so they can say they've been there) that Batista's no longer cares about the customer as much as they used to. Or, for all I've written, it might have just been a bad night. Whatever the case, it was a disappointing enough experience that I won't be going back, and I won't be taking guests there. Hope you all have better luck than I did."

The walls are packed with all kinds of pictures and autographs and other things to look at. It's got exactly the kind of character that I love. There's even an elderly man with a accordion thing that walks around and serenades the tables. (Tips are encouraged.) I just absolutely loved it.\n\nThe menu is posted up on the wall and is pretty straightforward. You get unlimited red or white wine. You get a house salad or minestrone soup. You get garlic bread. You choose your entree (there are about 5 different price levels ranging from $22 to $40), everything from spaghetti and meatballs to ribeye. If your entree doesn't already involve pasta, you get a side of penne with marinara sauce. You get a cappuccino. For the amount of food and drink involved and the quality, it's a pretty good deal for your money.\n\nThe wine was pretty good for being house wine. (We went with the red.) The salad was tasty - I liked the dressing. The minestrone soup was some of the best we've had. Our entrees were large and filling and yum. I opted for the steak caruso. It was a perfectly cooked steak on top of pasta with mushrooms and other veggies and just a little bit of a kick. The cappuccino was good. And we even got a free dessert, complete with a candle, since we mentioned it was our anniversary when we made our reservation. And that was tasty too. It wasn't the best pasta ever or anything, but it was good. And the ambiance made it awesome.\n\nThe service was great. Friendly and attentive. Never rushed. Checked on just the right amount. Good pace to all the food. All in all, we had a wonderful meal and experience here. I look forward to coming back."

Better to have high standards than none!\n\nHonestly- this place is way over priced and the food not so good. Only good thing going was the decor and the ambiance.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n1. Food way over priced. Yes, you get salad or soup, garlic bread and free red & white wine. But when you're paying min. $21, the main entree better taste good. And it didn't. Granted the portions are HUGE but still not worth if if the food is bad.\n2. I ordered the linguini seafood- the seafood part was good but the sauce was bland and tasted too much like tomato paste. The pasta itself was way too al dente. \n3. My sister ordered the cheese ravioli- the sauce was also way too bland and there was too much sauce on the dish. \n4. For dessert, we sampled the cheesecake- tasted like a frozen cheesecake from a local grocery store. \n5. The \"cappucino\" is really not cappucino. It's more like hot chocolate. Also, as an Italian restaurant, the owners should know better- in Italy, cappucino is a breakfast drink. In the evenings, one drinks espresso with or without liquor in it. \n6. Nothing special about the salad or the wines. I can definintely say I have had better wines.\n7. The guy with the accordion was a little creepy.\n\nI would never recommend this place to anyone other than to walk past it."

Pasta was boiled ahead of time and reheated.  EVERYTHING was greasy, running with butter and/or margarine.  As you can imagine, the wine was the cheapest jug p!ss money can buy.

We were staying at the Flamingo and could see Battista's from our hotel window, and considered it a sign!  Besides, Yelp seems to like this place, and I always trust my fellow Yelpers. \n\nYelp, I owe you one.  This was a great find!  My husband and I both had bowls of pasta which were delicious.  I had spaghetti with marinara while my hubby had ziti with a spicier red sauce.  Both were amazing, and really hit the spot!   Also, every dinner comes with buttery garlic bread, a salad, and unlimited wine.  Yes, you heard that right - UNLIMITED.  Amazing. \n\nThe decor is classic Italian meets Vegas for sure.  There are lots of autographed pictures of older celebrities, a giant collection of miniature liquors, plus just about everything else you can imagine.  It's very interesting and entertaining.  \n\nBottom line is:  I came here with a hangover, and left with a full belly and feeling a little tipsy.  That's what I call a win!"

They made substitutions without a hesitation, they were quick and attentive with their service and the food was great. I could come here every week if I didn't live 2000 miles away, I'd weigh a metric ton from all the food but I'd be happy and well taken care of. Bravo! Battista's, BRAVO!"

There was an hour wait but it was Saturday so that's expected and we anticipated the food being great so we stuck it out. We were really really disappointed.\n\nPros: Old school style, big portions, very cool (but busy/tacky) decor, real mob family type motif which was cool. Menu was on the wall and very simple, which is convenient.\n\nCons: Food. We didn't have a single good dish. Mozz sticks were not hot, and the outside crust was \"homemade\" but tasted like stale cardboard. The salads were Hurricane Katrina flooded with dressing, I like dressing, but dang the lettuce was floating! The free wine was very watered down, but what do you expect for free? We had Lasagna, one of my favorite dishes at every Italian restaurant, and Ravioli. The sauce is absolutely gross; It tasted like canned tomato paste, and not even the good kind. The sauce was so bad, I only ate about 1/4 of the Lasagna and that was a struggle. The raviolis weren't bad if you scraped off all the tomato paste. A good sauce is like one of the main guarantees you can expect at a good Italian place. For the sauce to be THAT bad, it was just utterly shocking.\n\nWe will not be eating here again or giving them another chance. Unless they come out with some sort of press release saying they've completely overhauled their sauce recipe."

Salad was so limp it  had obviously been sitting in dressing for hours and made me miss the olive garden. They actually managed to make spaghetti with meat sauce taste bad, and I'm not sure how that's even possible. 'Cappuccino' was actually a mug of instant hot chocolate.

Here's the thing, if this place was in a little town in the middle of nowhere, I'd say okay but it's just off the strip in Vegas. The culinary capital of the world people. There are at least 100 superb restaurants within a mile radius, so WHY would you ever go here??? lol but people do and my guess is, they're tourists and they don't know any better. I can pretty much guarantee if you are a local you would never ever choose to go here! \nThe place was packed! We had to wait over an hour, which didn't bother me because there was plenty of seating. The atmosphere is kinda cool but there are plenty of restaurants with that type of atmosphere/decor. The service was not very good. My friends raviolis came out ice cold. I had the chicken parmigiana, it was okay, kinda bland - nothing special. The \"free wine\" (I use the term free very loosely since I paid $28 for a piece of chicken - I'm sure the price of that nasty free wine was compensated for with the overpriced piece of chicken) was disgusting....the red smelled and tasted like red wine vinegar and the white wine was warm - yes white wine warm!? There was spinach that accompanied my chicken that as soon as I took a bite I wanted to spit out....but of course didn't. It was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. I sat and tried to figure out this distinct (overwhelming) flavor in the spinach and when the server came over I asked her if anise was in the spinach. She looked at me in surprise and said you're the only person that has ever guessed what's in that. She said people either love it or they tell her to get it off their plate. I'm guessing the former group is a small group, so I'm wondering why they serve it? Oh gawd it was gross. Black licorice flavored mushy over cooked spinach.....not my idea of good food. Sorry but if you're planning on going, I'd say go across the street to McDonald's and save yourself some money......seriously! \nBTW - there were a group of Italian speaking guys behind us that got their food as we were leaving......gawd I wish I could have seen their face when they bit into that \"Italian\" food!!"

We thought it was great.\n\nFast forward four years... my brother is now living in Vegas, and my immediate family decided to meet there for Christmas.  Having remembered my wonderful experience at this restaurant, I decided we should all go.  BIG mistake.  The wine tasted like 2-buck Chuck that had been opened five days before.  The salad was comprised of iceberg lettuce and topped off with a hunk of salami.  I'm pretty sure the sauce was Ragu.  My brother, an erstwhile captain in the Army, said he'd rather have an MRE (meal ready to eat) than dine at Battista's again.\n\nThe little man playing the accordion knew the Ohio State fight song.

The all you can drink house red and white were already in carafes on our table and we were ready for more merriment.  Fairly loud restaurant (or maybe we were the ones being loud) that can easily accommodate large groups such as ours.  I'm actually surprised that we weren't kicked out with all the f-bombs that we were dropping.\n\nThe food seemed well rehearsed, as the bread came out quickly, as well as, the standard single-serving sides of salad or soup.  Our pasta orders were placed fairly quickly and the meal arrived on room service carts.   The after dinner cappuccino, with a healthy dollop of \"whipped cream\", arrived just as quickly afterwards.  Food is not too spectacular (seemed fairly Costco-y if you know what I mean) but the service was quick and they have a doorman that can take care of your after dinner entertainment.   \n\nParking lot was right in front of the restaurant and fairly safe despite the look of the neighborhood.  They let me leave my car there, overnight, and it was alright the next day.  \n\nMade reservations and had to put down 10% on a credit card due to our large party size.    ~$32.5 pp including autograt of 20%.  I probably won't go back for the food, but works for large groups, not interested in buffets but interested in drinking copious amounts of cheap wine in plastic cups.\n\n(2* for food, 4* for service)"

However, after his suggestion, the wife and I gave it a shot. First, its not the best Italian food in Las Vegas..but it has the best atmosphere by far. When you eat at BHIW you will be taken back to a time when the mafia had more control than the giant corporations. The pictures on the wall include all sorts of famous people, and each little dining area has a bit of a different feel. The menu is basic, and written up on the wall. Dinner is an all inclusive deal, with soup, salad, bread, entree, ALL YOU CARE TO DRINK HOUSE WINE and a cappuccino. The price is higher than other places, but you have to pay a little for the authenticity and proximity to the Strip...as well as the free wine. I've never had anything bad here, and it has become a favorite of my very picky family. The wine isn't the best, but its included! My favorite dish is the manicotti, but I don't dig the spinach that comes with it. \n\nThe atmosphere is also improved by a little old Italian man who plays the accordion. For a few dollars he will play you a tune. Some people may think this is creepy, but I think its charming."

The meals come with complimentary all you can drink house red or white wine, which makes the prices very affordable if you're a wine drinker. At the end of the meal, they serve complimentary espresso, which is to die for! On top of it all, there is this adorable little old Italian man that walks around and serenades for tips, of course. This place has been around for years for a reason! It's a must on the Vegas list."

We got it in spades! \nWe were seated within 5 minutes of our reservation time and were greeted by a very friendly and competent server. The free wine wasn't at the 100 pt. level, but, was definitely decent and together, most of us enjoyed more than one carafe. Garlic bread was great and pastas were better than average. One of our party ordered a steak which was undercooked, but, was reluctant to send it back. I asked gently if there was something she could do and she immediately apologized and grabbed the dish to cook further. It came back quickly and was turned out to be very good. Cappacino was ok, but, overall service, atmosphere and food was great, especially for the amount we spent. I would visit over again and recommend to everyone."

Here's your wine (all-you-can-drink), \"You want soup or salad?\", here's your bread, order off the menu that's on the wall, and you get cappuccino that tastes suspiciously like ovaltine at the end. Perfect before a night of drinking and dabauchery.\n\nRestaurant can get pretty busy (30-45 minute wait), but no prob, just pop on over to Stage Door next door for a quick drink. Mamasan (the best bartender ever) gave us a $10 off coupon. Thanks!\n\nI'm notorious for eating off if everyone's plate, and it's all good. I notoriously avoid carbs in California, but savor the garlic bread here. Comfort food at its finest. I almost always get the chicken Parmesan and it's seriously better every time I order it. Oh, and the portions are HUGE. Come hungry AND thirsty!"

If you are looking for high end Italian, skip Battista's. But  if you would like an real old time Vegas experience at a reasonable (for the strip) price then give it a go. Positives...ambiance......  place is filled with an enormous amount of Vegas / celebrity memorabilia. Just sitting and looking around was an entertainment event all by itself. Service was excellent and the house wine (FREE!!)  ((Yes I said FREE!!!)) is surprisingly decent. You get garlic bread (OK) and a choice of soup (minestrone) or salad, We had the soup and it was good.Negatives......  Entrees were...pedantic.  I had the veal piccante and my wife had fettuccine with chicken. My veal was a little tough and the portion was small. My wife's chicken was certainly \"cooked\" and very dead...No juice was saved in the killing of this fowl. :-)  Still full meal on the strip for two with unlimited wine for less that $75 including tip has value. The ambiance is really worth the trip as well. I guess my recommendation is if the old Vegas experience is on your bucket list   Then please enjoy. If you are looking fro excellent Italian food...ehh maybe move on"

As last night was our friends birthday and she wanted to go there, we figured it would be great to go back. \"Aye Carumba\", what the heck happened to this place.\nThe place was jam packed with people and took forever to be seated because, unless your whole party is present, they won't seat you even with a reservation.  Once we got seated, it was a quick explanation of the menu and if we needed any time to order.  We ordered our food and \"Wham-O\", our food was there immediately.  We had Chicken Cacciatore and Veal Parmigiana as our main course.  The chicken was dry and the veal was thin & fatty.  The sauces were thin and seemed watered down.  At the end of our meals, the server, who had the personality of a wet mop, immediately threw down the check without asking if we needed anything else or if we wanted dessert.  It would have been a shame because the Cannoli, which wasn't the best, was the best part of this meal.  We also ordered a side of sausage, which were thin sliced pieces covered in a pasty tomato sauce for $8.50!  \nParking sucked!! It was a nightmare to get there, the parking lot is small and they park limos right in front of the entry making it impossible to get by.  We had to park at a nearby hotel and walk to the restaurant.\nI don't know if the original owners are involved or even care about the place anymore but it SUCKED!!  Obviously, they are only catering to tourists and their past history.  I can't see how locals would keep going there with so many other good Italian restaurants in town.\nUnfortunately, we will never be back there again.  I'd rather remember the past good times there than the feeling like I just ate at a Furr's Cafeteria!"

Therefore, I know good food, and bad food, when I see it.\n\nBattista's Hole in the Wall is the absolute worst restaurant I have ever been to. Listed below are all the reasons why:\n\n1. The Hostesses. All the hostesses were cold and unfriendly. Did not smile or welcome us. When asked to be seated they told us we had to have our whole party there (understandable for large parties) but we were a party of 4, 2 of us were there. When asked to see a menu, they handed us a paper menu with ZERO descriptions and when asked about the descriptions, they informed us that our server would inform us.\n\n1. The Server. When seated the was extremely clueless. He asked us several times if we had any questions, yet when we asked him questions he did not know. We asked him to explain the menu, and he pointed to the menu on the wall and told us to look at it. When asked what beers there were he told us all kinds, then only mentioned 2. He was very un attentive and took forever to do anything. \n\n3. According player. As you \"enjoy complimentary\" soup/salad and bread, Gollum from The Lord of the Rings comes to your table and tells you (not asks) to play your party a song. Then, he awkwardly stands there until you reluctantly reach into your pocket/purse to give him a tip. \n\n4. The Food. The food was awful. The dishes are pre-made ($25+) meals which are extremely unappetizing. Literally, they tasted like TV dinners. We had Chicken Alfredo, Chicken Parmesan, and Beef Ravioli. Everyone hated they're dishes.\n\n5. Cover Charge. Considering I hated my meal, I returned it to the server assuming he would take it off the check. He did not. Only after requesting it's removal, the check is returned with a \"cover charge.\" He did not tell us what this was and when asked, he informed us that \"when someone doesn't order a dish a cover charge is done to cover the \"included\" soup/salad/bread. In my case since I sent my dish back, they decided to charge me $12 for their awful starters. \n \nFrom start to finish I had the absolute worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant and left hungry. Please do not waste your time/money on this place. I would give it no stars if I could. At this rate, Battista's will surely go out of business."

The food is already prepared and plated (think airline food) and is brought out seconds after ordering. All the food is moved from table to table on carts, and when you order they pull a plate off the cart and serve you. They're simply trying to move as many people through as possible. We thought we'd have a nice, relaxing, long Italian meal with family and friends but after less than 45 minutes the waiter asked if we could leave because they needed the table for another party. Unreal. Half of our party wasn't even finished with their meal. For a bill in excess of $300 we should've at least been afforded the opportunity to order dessert or finish our wine. \nIt's super expensive. No dish cheaper than $23...and that was for simple spaghetti. The better dishes are $35 and up. \nIt's designed to push as many patrons through as they can. Unfriendly. Unwelcoming. Expensive. Not Italian. Don't go."

There are dozens of pictures of celebrities on the walls. We were seated in a back room near he kitchen, and quickly started thinking we were forgotten. It took a good 10 or 12 minutes before a waiter approached our table again. I was worried the service would be terrible and we would be there for hours.\n\nI was proven very wrong. As soon as a waiter came to our table we had our bread in seconds, salads and soup maybe 2 minutes later, main course within 10 minutes, and coffee as soon as dinner was done.\n\nThe service was so fast I was stunned. Now the food:\n\nI ordered the Chicken Parm, which came with free unlimited house wine (red and white, both quite good), soup or salad (I got the salad, kind of a cross between a regular Italian salad and antipasto; it had lettuce and dressing and olives and also salami and pepperoncini), a pasta side, garlic bread, and cappuccino.\n\nEverything was delicious, and the price was very cheap for being so close to the Strip. I will not go to Vegas again without a stop at Battista's."

I believe Kerry was the head server there and the staff was absolutely spectacular!  I couldn't believe how  together they kept everything in spite of the fact that the restaurant was completely packed beyond belief.  \n\nKudos to Bautista's and their professionalism, quality food and environment!

For that reason alone I add the second star.\n\nBeware....the wine is not drinkable.  The salad didn't appear fresh and was served so quickly that they had to be mass produced and sitting around in the kitchen.  The meatballs were good, but the sausage was lacking in taste.  We had ravioli and spaghetti as well, I can't believe how bad the sauce was....bitter and tasteless.\n\nThere has to be better Italian food in Vegas....and I'll be searching for it next visit."

You can split the entree for an extra $10 and you both get the extras, including the wine. \n\nThe food is certainly not the best but it's not at all bad considering the portion size and ambiance.

The white wine was perfectly sweet and chilled just enough. Garlic bread and salad came next. I usually don't like an oil-based dressing but this one was so delicious! I ate up the whole thing. For dinner, I chose the chicken alfredo. It was a perfect portion of pasta and coated perfectly in just enough sauce. The chicken on top was so tender and fell apart with a touch of the fork. It was so delicious! Soon after we were finished, the cappuccino came next. It was so yummy! I'm not usually a cappuccino person but this one was nutty, creamy, and sweet. So good! \n\nWhat I love most was it was all included for one price. There was no question of what the final bill would be and they were so efficient in getting all the food and drinks coming quickly one after the other. Can't wait to go back!"

Reservations are important, but you can get one same day if you need to.\n\nWe got there a few minutes early and were seated right on time for our reservation.  The first thing they did was put a big bottle of wine on our table and say that we could have all we could drink of it (yay!).  The menu is pretty simple, different kinds of delicious italian food separated by price range (about $21-30 a plate, including soup/salad, wine, garlic bread, and meal).\n\nThe garlic bread was delicious and the wine was decent (but free, and for some reason I liked it more and more as the night progressed...).  The salad was a pretty average italian salad, but the lasagna was wonderful (although by that point I had quite a bit of wine in me, but I think it would have been great anyway).\n\nSo I would definitely recommend this place, I found myself disappointed when I was full because there was plenty of food left on my plate and I wished there was room for more of it in my stomach.  It was a night ender though because my friend and I were both completely trashed from all the free wine by the end of the meal."

Inside the place is very old school lots of celeb pics on the wall.  \nWhen we were seated at our table 2 carafes of wine were included (1 red, 1 white) all you can drink house. The menu seems a little pricey $28 for chick parm but with wine,salad,garlic bread and a cappuccino following your meal its not that bad.\n\nThe salad was dressed with a House Italian dressing which was tasty and also came with a few pieces of salami and a nice hunk of cheese.\nGarlic Bread was very good.  Plenty of garlic and butter and seemed to be very fresh.\nThe Chicken parm was tender and juicy and thick.\n\nNow the sauce - It was a little sweet and bland which is why only 4 stars.  We had them bring a little garlic powder to the table to give it a little more flavor.\n\nThe cappuccino was a nice touch for after the meal. Topped high with whipped cream.\n\nWe would go back again although I would probably order the Alfredo sauce."

We were basically finished after this meal because it was a lot, but cannot wait to go back, will never go to Vegas without a stop at Batista's. Oh and got a tid bit from a cabbi, the reason it's named HOLE IN THE WALL  is because back in the day during prohibition they used to have a fake brick wall in the back and when the police would come by they would go through a trap door with thier alcohol. Just had to add it, thought it was a cool story. And Thanks Vito for being the best waiter!!!!"

I had the fettucino alfredo and it was decent, flavorful and fresh. Was it the best alfredo? No. Was it good, yes. \n\nThis place is more about the ambiance and history. It's an all inclusive price for each meal (ranging from $22 - $40). My dish included all you can drink red and white wine. The red wine was \"meh\" but it was free so no complaints here. Not a fan of white wine so I didn't really enjoy it. \n\nThe salad was surprisingly simple and tasty. The garlic bread was fresh and tasted great. The after dinner cappuccino wasn't very good, super sweet and luke warm. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place especially if you're with a group of people.

Battista's is located about a block off of the strip behind the Flamingo. Plenty of parking right by the door. Expect a little wait, but it's worth it. We usually pass the time by stopping at the dive bar in the same parking lot for a couple cheap PBRs.\n\nLike other reviewers have noted, it is a bit overpriced. You can expect to pay in the neighborhood of $60 with tip for two adults. But hey, it's Las Vegas, who cares!? You wont leave hungry or without being at least mildly buzzed. My wife usually gets fettucini and I'll order Spaghetti and Meatballs. As soon as your wait-staff approaches your table you are offered a craft of house wine. Its good enough, you wont be disappointed. The garlic bread is very very good and i'm usually not that generous with garlic bread. My wife gave the salad a thumbs up and you can sub applesauce for the picky eater in your crowd. The entree portions are large and we have no complaints with the food at all. The complimentary desert Cappuccino is AWESOME. I don't drink coffee or cappuccino and I love it.  I think its closer to hot chocolate than any kind of coffee/cappuccino. But seriously, it's a tasty way to round out the meal.\n\nThe biggest bummer is the increasingly creepy accordion player. The first time we went to Battista's we were entertained and thought it was a neat touch, the rest of my family loved him as well. He'll ask you where you're from, pretend to play a song associated with that place and mumble out-of-tune some lyrics for 20-30 seconds and then stand there uncomfortably until he sees some money. I didn't really have a problem until our last visit. Being that we were on vacation, I didn't have any bills smaller than a $50. We hoped to avoid him, but he was unavoidable. Once he was done singing his 20 second off-key rendition of \"Back home again in Indiana\", we thanked him as he tapped on the money clip on his Accordion. I explained that we appreciated it and we would catch him later in the night once we paid our bill. We got a snide, \"Well I guess we'll just see about that\" back at us. Super awkward and embarrassing moment in front of my wife and others seated near by. Really!? We're here eating $30 plates of spaghetti, do you really think i'm trying to cheat you out of a couple bucks for a tip? We're on vacation and only have large bills/credit cards. Once we paid our bill my wife tracked him down and gave him a tip, but made sure to tell him how disappointing he made our stop.\n\nIt wasn't until I read a few reviews on here that I found out I was not alone. We decided we're just going to decline as soon as he steps up to our table if we go back in the future. Though it would be fun to try out some new places and see if he has a song for Madagascar, Bokoro, or somewhere else equally obscure.\n\nI'm not saying I wouldn't recommend this place to someone else, but the accordion guy can suck one. If you try somewhere exotic, post and let me know what he plays."

When I walked into the restaurant, I felt like a navy seal trying to break into Binladen's compound using night vision goggles. They seriously need to lighten up this joint. Noise level is average for your average Italian restaurant.\n\nService (2/5):\nI had reserved a table for 4 and we were sited immediately when our full party arrived. I would recommend reserving a table ahead of time, especially on weekend. The server was very good, he got us the wine and garlic bread right after we ordered and he wasn't annoying like other places where waiters keep bothering you to see how you are doing. Also, avoid the musician whom goes from table to table literally playing nothing but a small tune and you feel obligated to give him money. \n\nFood (4/5):\nFood is pretty good.  Meals range from $23-45 and they courses contain salad/soup, garlic bread, house wine (red/white), entr\u00e9e, and a cappuccino. I ordered salad, which was good; it wasn't drenched in dressing like many other places. House wine is all you can drink, but you get what you pay for.  Garlic bread was pretty good. It wasn't overly laced with garlic butter, so it complemented well with the main entree. My main entr\u00e9e was sausage with penne and meat sauce. Meat sauce was delicious, not to sour, and just the right amount of sweetness. The spicy sausage was amazing in flavor and it was cooked to perfection. The best part of the meal was cappuccino, which comes with all meals and it was one of the best post meal hot-dessert I've ever had. \n\nOverall (3/5), it's a decent off the strip joint. The prices are very reasonable for good meals, but the ambiance and service does need some work."

The meat sauce is definitely above average, along with the meatballs.\n\nSome people here say it is too expensive.  Sure, I can go down to South Las Vegas and get unlimited wine and beer from Studio B at the M Resort, but Battista's gets you filled up and full of wine 1 minute from the strip.  It is right behind the Flamingo.  \n\nI milk it a bit, take a while to order while I enjoy the wine.  I get my money's worth.\n\nAccordion player comes around to serenade you and your hot date.  \n\nOverall, I agree with the majority of posts here, the food is good, not the best, but solid.  You get a bang for your buck.  My advice is to stick to the cheaper options for a value play on Vegas."

            "review": "Simone and I have always loved Battista's Hole In the Wall located just off the strip in Las Vegas. It has an old Vegas vibe, and always has very good home cooked Italian food.  We first went to Battista's during our honeymoon on the advise of a travel book and we have been back three or four times since. With our vacation winding down and the reality of going back to our everyday world creeping in, we decided what better way to cheer ourselves up then to visit our old standby.  Although located in a easy to miss small strip mall behind the Flamingo Hotel and Casino Battista's is always busy, no matter what time or what day you go, be prepared to either make a reservation or wait for at least 15 minutes. They are only open for dinner and locals and tourists alike fill up the many tables quickly.  Waiting for a table at Battista's is torture for the soul. As you sit and take in the many pictures of celebrities, the mini Liquor bottle collection and the strange Knic-knacks that fill the ceiling you are overcome by the delicious aroma from the kitchen of fresh baked Garlic Bread and Ripe Tomato Sauce.\nAfter about a 15 minute wait Simone and I were led to a table in one of the side rooms. It was only a few seconds before the waitress got to our table with two full pitchers of House Red and White Wine. This is one of the wonderful surprises that you get at Battista's. With every meal comes lots of House Red and White wine, and while a wine snob may not find this to be the best they have ever tasted, to a Maine redneck like me, it is perfection in a pitcher. Also free with the meal is some very toasty Garlic bread that is pasted with crushed whole cloves of garlic. Don't worry about saving the bread for dinner, when you finish it they'll bring you more... Each meal also comes with Minestrone Soup or a fresh Italian Salad with house made vinaigrette, salami, cheese, tomatoes and an olive.  We have never had the soup ( don't want to fill up on all that broth) but we do enjoy the salad. To finish off the free stuff you also get a side of basic pasta with your choice of sauce.\nThere are no menus on the table at Battista's. They are posted on the wall of every room. Although the prices at first glance seem pricey ( chicken at 27.00- insanity !) keep in mind you are getting endless wine and bread, fresh soup or salad, pasta and oh yeah, the best damn Cappuccino ever to finish the meal. More on that later.\nFor her meal, Simone had Spaghetti and Meatballs and I ordered Veal Parmesan. While we waited for our meal we were greeted with a song from our favorite little old man accordion player. It is rumored that he has been going from table to table performing since Battista's first came to Vegas more then 30 years ago. He looks to be in his nineties, but he plays a damn good accordion, and in my opinion ( which is always correct) He really just puts the icing on the whole Battista experience. Italian wine, Italian food and Italian music. You get it all when you are here. The food arrived shortly after our evening serenade and although I have seen prettier dishes, they were cooked perfectly. The Veal was literally drowning in melted Mozzarella and fresh ripe tasting Tomato Sauce. If you do not love your cheese then avoid this. If you do love cheese ( and also baby cow) then this is the dish for you.  Along with the Veal was a side of intense flavored spinach seasoned with spices including a good dose of nutmeg. This was different but good. Simone shared her meatballs which were also very good. Large, tender and well seasoned they mixed perfectly with the tomato sauce and al dente spaghetti. Surprisingly we finished everything ( including most of the wine-yow!)   After some deliberation we decided to finish the meal with the Italian specialty Cannoli, with of course two (free) Cappuccino's. The Cannoli shell was crispy and mildly vanilla flavored while the smooth and creamy cheese filling was rich and dense. \nThe Cappuccino is not to be missed, it is unlike any other - Its not at all like coffee. Its not bitter but slightly chocolaty sweet and it is the perfect way to end your meal.  \nWe love it here and would suggest it to anyone looking to get away from the craziness of the strip, get drunk on cheap wine, and have some damn good Italian food while being brought back to the old"

The red and white bottle of wine were placed on our table, which I enjoyed.  After our order was taken, we were served soup or salad, and both were very good.  The bread was good as well.  I had the ziti with meat sauce and to me it was very tasty.  My daughter enjoyed the cappuchino.  I'm not sure why other people give this restaurant negative marks.

They were so rude about it I almost got up to tell them to shut up. They even said something to a couple that just sat down about how they couldn't get a wine glass for the free wine, they give you a little shot glass to drink from but that's fine ! Not something to complain about. They were being so long about how they were never coming back which is fine but keep it down and to yourself!!! We had a great experience thank you !"

This time she said they don't take reservations for the next 30 minutes (it was 5:20), but she didn't have anything until 7:30 anyway and we should just walk in. I asked how long the wait was: 15 minutes. So we showed up; same girl said she could take us right away.

To start with, the free house wine tasted like grape juice and vinegar and was completely undrinkable. The salad was served overdressed in Italian dressing, which made the lettuce soggy.  This was the oddest salad I'd ever been served.  It included a single black olive, a single grape tomato, one whole pepperoncini, sliced carrots, a huge slice of salami, and a big chunk of cheese.  The \"garlic\" bread did not taste of garlic at all. It just tasted like Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning on really greasy bad bread.  My husband ordered the shrimp scampi and he said that the shrimp was pretty good but the rest was just average. I ordered the chicken parmesan. The pasta side dish with cooked fine and the sauce was not bad. The chicken was cooked properly but the giant hunk of melted mozzarella did nothing to cover up the fact that the breading on the chicken soggy and tasteless.   The topper was the side of creamed spinach... call 1973 they want their side dish back!  Our water was served in plastic cafeteria cups and the cup of cappuccino at the end of the meal was served in a plastic mug.

On both of these visits, I am pretty sure that I did a whole lot more drinking than eating, and my memory is that the food was good, if not downright tasty.\n\nWhen we went back to Las Vegas, I figured that we had to visit Battista's again, so we stopped by - with the same friend who was married on our last visit.  As it turned out, none of us really drank (other than to taste the wine that still flows freely).  We found out that it's really pretty bad.  Sure, it is included, but the reason for that is that it's just not very good.\n\nThe food portions don't seem to be as large as I remember, though the prices haven't really changed that much.  All-in-all, it brings to mind that old saying \"you can't go back again\"."

It was inedible. \n- the vegetable minestrone soup is made from beef broth. The server didn't mention it until we specifically asked. Why call it vegetable soup if it isn't vegetarian?? \n- the capacino served at the end is diabetic inducing. It has way too much sugar. How about not adding sugar and giving it on the side?\n\nUgly:\n- the clam pasta had 5 clams each the size of a dime. The pasta sauce (olive oil and garlic) had very little flavour and taste. \n- the vegetarian Pasta (Tomato based sauce) was bland and flavorless. I've had store bought pasta sauce that tasted better. \n-the lighting in the restaurant is horrid. It's a mix of dark yellow and orange. At first we didn't mind it, but as we spent more time in the restaurant, we started getting headaches. And we couldn't enjoy whatever little taste the food had. \n- With all the problems above, the food is very expensive and you are left with a big hole in your wallet. \n\nMy experience at this restaurant has been a life changing one. I have decided that hence forth I shall never ever set foot inside a restaurant that has rating of less than 4 stars. \n\nTl;dr: stay away from this place!"

I went with a big group, so I had the chance to see many menu items plated and try more than one dish.\n\nAmbience: Very kitschy and dark, lots of old photos and vintage cans, signs & baskets.  Equal parts fun and tacky.\n\nDrinks: Free bottomless house wine.  Not a drinker, but apparently its passable but no memorable.\n\nService: not friendly, just efficient.  Not super helpful either.\n\nSalad: (included with the meal) 2 stars, boring, lightly vinaigretted greens with a chunk of cheese and a slice of pastrami.\n\nGarlic Bread: (included) Superb, 4 stars.  Warm, fresh, crispy and soft.\n\nChicken Alfredo (entree): 3 stars. The sauce was fine, the grilled chicken was good.\n\nFilet Mignon: (entree) 1 star.  I eat steak all the time, this was awful: tasteless, under cooked, & dry.  It's hard to mess up a piece of meat but Battistas has done it.  Almost identical to the memorable time I ordered steak at an Applebee's in 2006.  That bad.\n\nManicotti: (entree) 2 stars, the cheese was fine, but not much taste, and the sauce was pretty boring, kinda sweet.  Just bland overall.\n\nCappuccino: (included) was really just hot chocolate with whipped cream.  Good, but not what you expect.\n\nSpumoni Dessert: 3 stars, it was tasty layered ice cream.  Can't mess it up, delicious and recommended.\n\nTiramisu: overstrong flavor, but it looks pretty.  I can't rate it with justice because I don't like tiramisu.  Most at the table did not eat much of it."

The food is basic Italian, but in a good way, nothing fancy but full of flavor.  Faves from the table were the sausage cacciatore and shrimp with a tasty alfredo sauce.  But the real draw is the all you can drink house wine (both red and white) that they provide for the table.  There's a little man that goes around playing the accordion and the environment is lively and friendly.  The wait staff was fabulous as well."

Rating the food only, I'd give this place two stars.  However, I think you go here for the experience of going to an old-world tourist trap and doing so inexpensively.  In that sense, I think the experience is worth a higher rating and I'll be penciling this place in on my next visit to Vegas."

It's a family run Italian restaurant located between Flamingo and Bally's. It is not in a casino, but is located by a mini-mart. Reservations are recommended and it is only open for dinner (4:00 - 10:00). All meals include garlic bread, soup or salad, all the wine you can drink (house wine red or white only) and a cappuccino. We had the lasagna and chicken parmesan, which came with a side of pasta. Complete meals range from $20 to $40. A little old Italian guy goes from table to table and plays his accordion for tips.\n\nThe food was OK, nothing great. The wine was not good, but it was free. The garlic bread was great and the cappuccino was excellent (and I don't like coffee)."

I had a glass of wine at the bar before sitting down to get the feel of the place, lots of folks had reservations.  I should have stayed in the bar and ordered there instead of venturing into the dinner fixed price menu.\n\nService is great, the wait staff is the normal drink and food, union deal you find in Vegas.  Both servers were attentive.\n\nThe fixed price menu offers normal Italian fare, which is OK, the salad was OK, the pasta and meatballs were OK, the garlic bread was OK.  I've had better salads, spaghetti, meatballs, and sauce in many places.  Got - it's OK, just OK, not great, or good, just OK.  \n\nThe dinner menu includes \"wine\", you get to choose red or white, the waiter said their house wine is a burgundy, I'm thinking something between a drier malbec and a chianti, then I noticed it was refrigerated like a white.  It didn't taste like wine, it tasted more like a MD red, watered down with grape juice and water with a dash of vinegar thrown in for acidity.  I like wine, I'm not a wine snob, but I do know some, this was bad stuff, impressively bad.  I sipped through a full glass of this swill, attempting to determine if it was indeed that bad, and then what one would mix to make such an abomination.  \n\nI don't see how the hole in the wall maintains a 4 star rating on most websites, they must have a small army of very dedicated folks entering great reviews to counter the actual reviews.\n\nIf you must eat here, stay at the bar and order a la carte, unless you really want to experience the house wine, if you do venture in to sample this liquid darkness, please post a response and tell me what you think is mixed together to make such a concoction. \n\nSo to summarize - Great service, OK Food, old Vegas atmosphere, incredibly bad house wine."

It has now taken over as the WORST Italian Restaurant in Vegas (knocking Capo's to second worst). I can't imagine that Battista or Desi or any of the Battista family member have anything to do with it anymore because of how terrible it is. \n\nIt has expanded over the years and still has the look and charm of its better days. The hostess doormen are friendly. \"The future is in your hands\" sign next to the mens urinals is still there. I took a friend here that has never been but always wanted to try it. I hadn't tried it for 7 years so I was happy to revisit again with my BFF. I remember 7 years ago, the food was going down hill and was average at best, but everyplace deserve a second change and especially since it had been so long. \n\nIt was just the 2 of us and we were seated shortly after our 7pm reservation in the section to the back left as you face the kitchen.  The meal comes with your choice or Minestrone soup or salad, garlic bread, wine  with whatever dish you order. The wine is in large carafes on the table when you are seated. 1 is white the other a red blend. It comes with the 3 ounce glass. The wine is drinkable but its basically church wine.Even though I'm not usually a white wine fan the white was better than the red. Shortly after our server Brittney came over explained how the ordering and options work and took our orders. We both chose the Minestrone soup. I was split between that or a salad but on Brittney's suggestion I chose the soup. The soup comes out fairly quicklyand took the first sip...It's FRIGGEN' Progresso Minestrone or canned stuff for sure. It was closer to luke warm than hot but I eat about 3/4 the soup since I was starving. Its not that the soup is bad it just not good and canned soup is never okay to serve without at least doctoring it up.  I was unimpressed but so far not bad just not good. The garlic bread comes out and it was the highlight of the meal. It is probably the frozen garlic  hated as the consistency was not fresh baked or from a bakery at all. The pre perforated slices were a give away too. It was  fairly good though. We both order the Cheese Ravioli. They give you quite a few Ravioli unlike most that give you 5 or 6 at most you get twice that here. Unfortunately just like the rest of the food, it was just frozen Ravioli heated up and covered it what was most likely Ragu or some jarred garbage sauce. There was nothing home made tasting about the entire meal. Asked if we wanted the Cappuccino at the end , I couldn't stomach it after the disappointment of what I was put through the rest of the meal. \n\nThe highlight was the service and the original decorations/pictures hanging everywhere.  Brittney was a sexy, attentive and good server.  The busser was also quite good and of course the accordion player who was built with the place.\n\nEven with the service and atmosphere pluses I can't give Battista's any more than 1 star because the food does a disservice to Italian food and now Las Vegas. They exist now solely to trick the poor tourists into buying crappy food and cheap wine making them believe it is a deal. They need to close up shop or if they want to stay in business move shop to the Circus Circus Buffet.  I can't believe the Locatelli's would have anything to do with Battista's anymore and they just handle the real estate they own around the Valley now. That's what I believe at least."

Think In-N-Style. You select an item and it comes with: unlimited red/white wine, soup or salad, garlic bread, and a dessert cappuccino (aka a hot chocolate). $24.95 - $49.95 per person, based on meal option.\n\n2. Since a friend and I arrived an hour early, we waited at the bar, I ordered a diet coke and she a beer, and two apps: fried mozzarella & fried zucchini. Total: $34 The fried cheese and zucchini weren't anything special and we're $9.95 a piece and we're just average.\n\n3. Once our full party arrived, I learned I couldn't transfer my diet coke to the table, which was annoying. Our orders placed, soup, salad, garlic bread, and wine came to the table quickly.\n\n\n4. Since it was late (9:45 PM & they close at 10:30 PM), our table was seated in the only room with other patrons. It was packed and loud and we all felt squishy.\n\n5. My friend and her sister split the Veal Marsala ($31.95). It cost them an extra $13 for splitting a plate (because you get those included extras) The veal was overcooked and rubbery. I ordered the Steak Pizzaiola, which is basically a large piece of meat with marinara served with a side of garlic cream spinach. The steak was the blandest, least flavorful slab of meat, ever. The tomato sauce (calling it marinara would be a grave misjustice  to Italians everywhere) was also lackluster. Price point for this disaster $28.95. These two entrees came with a side of ziti and more of that tomato sauce.\n\n6. Lastly, the check came and so did the post meal cappuccino which tasted like a hot chocolate. This stuff was delicious. Rich, chocolatey and creamy. Nothing reminiscent of a cappuccino, not a hint of frothy milk.\n\nThe service was weak, the food was tasteless, and prices were gauged. Don't eat here. You'll be full, but you'll feel like you were just ripped off. \n\nButt-istas Hole in the Wall is what it shall be named henceforth."

Must I say more? \n\nI went there with a large group of friends, however the staff were very attentive and got our food out to is quickly. This is a very interesting restaurant. The menu is on the wall and you get to select the entr\u00e9e you would like. Your entr\u00e9e will come with wine, salad and the entr\u00e9e you've chosen. I decided to go with the eggplant Parmesan.  I hate to say it was just okay, but it was. I was starving so I literally slammed it down. It was just sort of soggy unfortunately. It really wasn't anything special. \n\nEveryone else seemed to really like their food though. I also think that the ambience and the fact that Battistas is off the strip is for sure a draw. It is also affordable and a nice change of pace of you are visiting the LV strip!"

We went in on a Saturday night around 7pm barely had to wait and were greeted by friendly staff.\n\nThe server came and greeted us with two bottles of wine, garlic bread and answered all our questions. I got the lasagna and my boyfriend got three chicken parm. The lasagna was a good size portion, just enough cheese and meat. I really liked it but it wasn't amazing just good. The chicken parm was pretty thick-not the best way to serve a chicken parm in my opinion. It should have been thinner and easier to eat. It came with cream of spinach and the portion was also really big. You will be full no matter what you get here. Plus the wine is unlimited! The free cappuccino is also awesome don't forget it at the end!!  Will be back the next time I want to be wasted and full."

My husband ordered the lasagna and it was very good. The dinner comes with your choice of Italian salad or minestrone. The salad was very basic, just lettuce mix, one grape tomato, a piece of salami and a pepperoni. The dressing tasted like just oil and vinegar. The minestrone was good but nothing extraordinary about it. The garlic bread that comes with the meal is wonderful! The waiter brings out a carafe of white and red wine that is included with the meal. The cappuccino was very good as well. \n\nOver all the experience was very good.

From the outside, it looks like a sleazy bar, maybe an extension of the liquor store next door. The inside looks like a low-rent version of Buca di Beppo, walls cluttered with photos and inscrutable memorabilia. I was worried that the food would taste like Buca, but my fears were assuaged. \n\nThey start you off with the \"free\" wine and tiny glasses; my large party had carafes of white and red. The white was perfectly pleasant \"chablis,\" and though I didn't sample the \"burgundy,\" my companions pronounced it to be nearly palatable.\n\nThen the garlic bread appeared. Like an idiot, I gorged myself on it. It was quintessential - fluffy but chewy, loaded with salty garlic-ness. \n\nThe minestrone soup (also included) tasted fine, though the base was a bit gummy. Most of my tablemates opted for the salad - I just do not understand.\n\nBy the time my lasagna arrived, big as a brick and covered in molten cheese, I was so full I could only take two bites. But man, was it good! \n\nThe food is very straightforward, American-style Italian, cooked to generally pleasing textures. Very appetizing stuff. So good that I took several more bites of lasagna than I should have. \n\nTo cap the night, they offer you this little mug of cappuccino topped with whipped cream. Honestly, it tasted like hot cocoa, which is fine by me!\n\nThe prices were outrageous, of course, this being just off the Las Vegas Strip. At $25, my lasagna was one of the cheaper entrees on the board. But considering the extras, the large portion sizes, and the appealing renditions of American-Italian classics, I'd say it's worth a shot."

Now I wish I had taken the risk..\n\nI would call this \"meat and potatoes\" Italian.   If you are looking for high end, delicate/innovative italian, this isn't it. This is old school italian.   It reminds me of what my grandmother used to make.  Stated another way, this isn't the  high end italian you would find in New York or San Francisco but it is eons above what you would find at Olive Garden.\n\nI can tell a lot about a restaurant by the salad and dressing they serve.  So many restaurants in Las Vegas serve iceberg and drown it in gloppy dressing.   This restaurant  used a variety of greens and didn't drown the lettuce with an inch of dressing - good first start.\n\nService was friendly and prompt.   Server recommended the lasagna, and it was excellent..  They don't use cheap cheese here either.  And, unlike some of the other reviewers, I enjoyed their red sauce.  \n\nWine was fine - reminded me of some hole in the wall italian restaurants in Rome I found myself in a couple of decades ago.   If you are a wine connoisseur and belong to three wine clubs in Sonoma, you are going to have issues, but for standard table wine, it was fine.  \n\nIn sum, I would say good value for the money.   Efficient and friendly service, solid food, with quality ingredients.  For a strip restaurant, I didn't feel it was over priced, nor did I feel like I was eating at a chain restaurant.  We'll be back.\n\nDo make a reservation.  I was shocked to see how many people were there on a dead Sunday nite in Las Vegas."

Bloated prices and quite frankly mediocre food have reduced what was once a must see for visitors to a place to avoid.  Even the portions are shrinking.  We started with the garlic bread which was stale and had almost no garlic flavor.  The salad was what i call a lazy salad.  It was essentially lettuce and some fillers and instead of shredding or chopping the cheese and unidentifiable salami like substance, they simply put a block of cheese on the salad and one round piece of salami.  Clearly a chef who takes no pride in what leaves the kitchen.  The kids got a small bowl of ravioli for 13.95 which was boring.  The adult menu starts at 24.95 with a high price over $30.00. I tried the chicken parm.  It was ok but the chicken was not moist and the sauce watery.  The side of ziti was  flavorless.  The spaghetti and meatballs were ok but the meatballs were overly dense.  \n\nAll in all a disappointing meal.  I used to recommend this place to out of town guests but no longer.  It also appears that they raised their prices when the High Roller arrived which makes this place no longer an affordable value."

It's not a matter of being cheap its quantity.  This is why I am so-so on this place because the food was ok in my opinion.  My wife thought it was good.  We got the eggplant parmigiana.

There is a $13 charge for the additional person that doesn't order a meal in addition to the cost of the plate but you get a salad/soup and all the wine and garlic bread.

In Las Vegas, there are a lot of big-money, generic restaurants that aren't all that original or interesting.  Battista's is not one of them.  It definitely has its unique charm and its culture that isn't found anywhere else.\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing.  From the garlic bread to the eggplant dish I had, it was delicious and I left feeling like maybe I could have used some restraint.\n\nI would definitely recommend making reservations ahead of time.  It was packed and even with our reservations we had to wait ten or so minutes.\n\nDefinitely a place I'd recommend in Las Vegas if you want something local and interesting."

An older woman (Linda) was bartending and acted like she would rather be anywhere but there. Grown men actually admitted they were scared to flag her down or call her over. When I asked for a drink menu she said they didn't have one, then a few moments later produced a beer and wine menu which is what I wanted. The wine I ordered (a Riesling) was good and so were the toasted ravioli. It was 1.5 hours wait to be seated. Then I ordered the spaghetti and meat sauce and my husband ordered a steak dish. My spaghetti was horrible and bland, as was my husband's dish. I will say the salad, minestrone soup and table wine were fine. But for the price we paid, I would not recommend this place."

I had the steak pizziola or something like that and it had an intense garlic mushroom tomato sauce. Someone else on the table had lasagna and someone else had the cheese tortellini - all were very good and the tomato sauces were each different. Not the greatest dishes ever but solid and tasty. \n\nThe all inclusive is a nice touch. Bottomless house  wine! And a cappuccino!

It has a wide range of options for a decent price, and you received garlic bread, a soup or salad, unlimited red or white house wine, cappuccino, a pasta side, and your main. My friends and I had the soup and garlic bread, which were both delicious. We were also very impressed with the house wine, which wasn't too dry. We also tried the linguini with clams, the spaghetti with meatballs, and the pomodoro. All were very good, and we couldn't even eat half of our portions.

I stuck with spaghetti and meatballs and thought it was tasty but not the best I've ever had. My friends felt the same about their meals. I will say the after dinner cappuccino was delightful.

The garlic bread was embarrassing - too much garlic and so drenched with something (oil or butter?) that it could't possibly toast well.  Garlic bread should have a slight hint of a taste of garlic, not be a weapon of mass Dracula destruction.  The green salad was drowned in dressing.  The pasta came sticky, an indication that it wasn't freshly prepared but had been sitting around a while.  The red sauce tasted no better than cheap jar sauce you can buy at any grocery stores.  The sausage had no taste.  The veal piccante (piccata) had no taste.  The red house wine is truly pathetic.  \n\nIn Italy, this restaurant would be run out of town!

It is old school the food is heavy and comes out in large portions.the accordion player played all the Sinatra/Martin songs we could throw at him while we were waiting at the bar for our table. I enjoyed my veal parma very much. I am only giving 4 stars as yes like some other reviewers I agree the place does need a little overhaul. I would not change anything but I would clean up a bit perhaps dust repaint some parts but still keep all the history."

My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.\n\nIt's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.\n\nService was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again."

We had reservations and they were ready for us and seated us as soon as our party was there.  All I can say is the wine was flowin (free btw-coplimentary with your dinner) the bread kept comin and service was great!  The bread is drenched in butter...not good for the cholesterol but pretty darn good.  My bf and I ordered ziti with meatballs and pink sauce.  Pink sauce isn't on the menu but they said they would do it for us.  It was pretty average.  I've definitely had better.  We also ordered sausage and peppers and the bf loved that.  From the looks of everyone elses orders it was a wide variety of selections and I didnt hear any complaints and there were alot of clean plates.\n\nI've been here several times and we definitely don't come for the food...it is pretty average...mainly for the the ambiance and the one of a kind experience.  Gordie, the accordion player, is such a pleasant addition to the experience as he gifts us with his music and witty songs.  It is a good place to celebrate special days with a group or even for date night.\n\nThe place is a Las Vegas staple amongst the locals and vacationers.\nIt is all about the simple things:  Gordie, the decor/ambiance, the menu on the wall, the complimentary wine, even the door to the restaurant that looks kinda like a barrel when you come through the front door.  Sometime simple is best. ;)"

I'll take that over a chain restaurants microwaved wannabe 's anytime. No matter what anyone else may say about this place what counts is: 1 - Is the food fresh? and 2-Does it taste good?  Yes on both counts here at Batistas. If you are someone who likes the fancy servings and high prices of the strip casino restaurants, this place is not for you. If you like good food served simple, then I recommend Batistas."

Literally, a bus or two will come through every evening as far as I can tell. (I am a 36 year resident of Las Vegas.)\n\n2. First, the food. Olive Garden is at least two levels better in quality. My wife and I believe the sauce is simply canned, nothing more or less. The lasagna, again, normal. Any degree of spice or uniquity is simply altogether missing. Strangely enough, the garlic bread was good and so was the expresso - small victories for a higher, mid-level priced dinner.\n\n3. I think the 'never-ending' free wine basically makes many customers happy in lieu of good food. It's normal.\n\n4. The wait was was long - 30 minutes, because of the tour bus. The bar drink we had while waiting was experience.\n\n5. With all due respect, the accordion player with the disability, was playing off of peoples emotions. He would play a few seconds literally, say the same thing to most of the tables in the room - most of it was geared towards how beautiful the female was, everyone would give him money,and then 30 minutes later, the same routine, and same peddling for money. It's not right. We felt pressured to do as the other tables did and give him a few bucks each time.\n\n6. Of all the Italian places to eat in Las Vegas, I would never suggest this place to eat. Fast-food or sit-down are all superior to this. \n\n7. As I read in another review, it is true that the decor is somewhat interesting with vintage Las Vegas pictures. But does this overcome the shortcomings? No. I am torn between 1 and 2 stars."

I enjoyed a Fat Tire Ale *love* and the bartender was sassy and a lot of fun. We had a good time chatting with the people who were waiting at the bar as well. I really liked the decor and we had calamari as an appetizer, which came out really quickly and was super. \n\nThe meal was delicious and the house wine was good, even though I shouldn't drink wine due to a sensitive stomach; my half glass was good! We all got the feeling that the server didn't really like us, for whatever reason, be it our behavior (we were actually pretty well behaved at this point in the trip) or his night not going so well. \n\nKeep in mind the portions are very large and the minimum charge per person isn't so bad, even if you share a dish between two and have to tag on the extra $, because you will leave full and satisfied. \n\nAll in all, the food was tasty and we had a great time!"

            "review": "My experience with Italian restaurants is that the best ones are not overseen by some chef wanting to make his or her mark on the cuisine, but by an immigrant who had spent the majority of his or her life feeding the family, and now that the kids are grown, has taken those skills to care for the restaurant's patrons. These establishments are usually holes in the wall, garlic and tomato-scented spots inserted into strip malls between a convenience store and a dry cleaners.\n\nWith that in mind, I chose Battista's Hole in the Wall when I went out to dinner with a group of convention-goers in Las Vegas last week.\n\nFirst off, this place is FUN! The walls were as crowded as the restaurant itself with pictures of Las Vegas royalty from years past. Trinkets and chotchkies hung in the room's nooks and crannies. Entering this restaurant is to enter the home of a person devoted to living life around the dining table, for that is where the day begins, pauses for respite, and ends.\n\nOnce seated, a stern waiter placed carafes of wine on our table, announcing that the wine and garlic bread are free, and the menus are on the wall. And indeed they were, but we hadn't noticed them until this fellow had called them to our attention.\n\nDuring our meal, a petite octogenarian traversed the dining room with an accordion as big as he (if not bigger), playing various tunes on request and hamming it up for the crowded tables. He focused on the pretty lady at our table and played her the tarantella, pausing to point at the black buttons on the left hand of the accordion to passionately cry: \"The BASS! Nobody plays BASS anymore!\" This was indeed dinner and a show.\n\nI had the cannelloni. It was OK. The accompanying spinach reminded me of frozen spinach, the kind that came out of a box and most of us generally detested as kids. A similar complaint came from another member of the group, who'd had the salmon and expressed concern that it had freezer burn. I'm not an expert in meat, so perhaps group-think has since led me to believe that the meat in my cannelloni was similarly spiced.\nAnother member of the group called the cappacino that the restaurant gives for free at the end of the meal: \"truck stop cappacino,\" referring to the machines that make it. It's no Starbucks drink, and it does taste like hot chocolate, which is why I liked it.\n\nWould I come here if I were dining alone? No. Would I come here with my date? Not a chance. This restaurant is not suited for such moments in our lives, neither where food nor ambiance are concerned. However: would I come here with a bunch of acquaintances who want to have a good time and perhaps eat a little food in the process? Sure. Battista's Hole in the Wall drops the pretentions of normal dining, challenges us to not take things as seriously as we normally do, and pay attention to those oft-ignored things that we rely upon throughout life.\n\nFor, in the words of the restaurant's owner: \"The BASS! Oh, NOBODY plays the BASS anymore!\""

You should be ashamed to have someone like that interacting with the public.  My colleagues and I were visiting from out of town and discussing some medical technologies when the accordion player forced himself onto our table, disrupted our conversation, berated us for using our phones to perform our jobs (we are medical IT), and then yelled at us when we didn't tip him for a 15 second melody when we didn't want him to impose himself upon us in the first place.  We didn't ASK you to join or conversation nor did we desire you to corner us at our table and shove your accordion in our faces.  He was disruptive and loud to the point that neighboring tables asked what his problem was.  \n\nHe is no different than the street window washers that try to hold you hostage after washing your windows when you didn't ask for it.\n\nThe situation could have been avoided if he had some social awareness or led with, \"May I interest you in a tune?\"\n\nThe food was good, but not so good as to be worth the wildly disrespectful service we encountered.

            "review": "I recently had my destination wedding in Las Vegas at the end of May and had about 40 guests fly in from Chicago with my husband and me. Of course we wanted to do something nice as a thank you for everyone, so we decided food would be the best thank you. We also didn't want to go into debt by having dinner at some place on the Strip with 40 people because let's be honest, we could spend a small fortune on drinks alone. Enter Battista's!\n\nOn a previous trip to Vegas, I convinced my now husband and another friend to try out Battista's Hole in the Wall. I had heard about this place for years, but never made it there and finally wanted to try it. Yes, it looks a bit sketchy from the outside (I think one of our guests who could see the building from their room in Bally's said, \"it looks like a place where the prostitutes hang out\"), but it is truly a fine, upstanding business. Live a little people!\n\nAnyway, since we had been to Battista's and really enjoyed the food previously AND you get all the wine INCLUDED with the meal, we decided to have our wedding dinner here. And I will always be happy we did.\n\nThere was already a large(er?) group that had reservations at 7pm on that Saturday, but since we were only going to have 40 people they were able to get us in at the same time. We were not all at one table, but in a room with other diners where we basically were sitting in an L-shaped table configuration. I thought it was fun to have other diners in there as well, and I hope they enjoyed some of our speeches/toasts. \n\nNow, the important part - the food. We had one couple that is pretty much on the pulse of everything chic and cool tell us they were so happy that the dinner is at Battista's since it had been recommended several time to them. And for good reason - I thought the food was excellent. I had Eggplant Parm and wish we I could have taken the large portion I had leftover with me. Everyone I spoke to gushed about their food and especially the cappuccino. I don't drink coffee, so I opted out, but those who do said it was the best they ever had. \n\nIn addition to the dinners and all the extras that come with them, we asked the servers to bring out dessert plates with assortments of what they had. Sadly, there was no cannoli, but they had tiramisu and spumoni. As mentioned, I'm not a coffee girl so I didn't try to tiramisu, but the spumoni was excellent! And they knew how much to bring out so there was nothing left! \nFor those of you looking to have a large dinner at Battista's, I believe our total bill was about $1400 all in. That's not bad for 40 people who were somewhat sober when they came and left full and tipsy! We let everyone order whatever they wanted off the menu, so it wasn't like there was a condensed menu to keep the prices down. I highly recommend Battista's Hole in the wall for large and small groups!\n\nPS - the accordion player visited us several times and was such a cute man! It's too bad our group didn't know more of the words to That's Amore!"

The woman coyly asked \"Do you want a good place?\", which of course we answered yes. She told us about Battista's, mentioning more than once that it was the best in town and it was owned by the mob. We asked if it was expensive and she said no, because it was owned by the mob and it wasn't in one of the casinos. We were sold and were happy to make the quick walk outside and across the street to check it out.\n\nThe ambiance is charming. A sweet man was working outside and opening the door for guests to get in from the cold. Once inside, it was dark and cluttered with random memorabilia of all kinds. We knew immediately this was going to be good. It's what a lot of restaurant chains try to accomplish but this place did authentically. It was going to be an hour to an hour and a half wait, but neither of us seemed to mind, so we grabbed a seat in the bar area and had a glass of wine and some calamari.  The calamari was very tender and a good snack while we waited. \n\nWe were seated about an hour later, taken to the back corner of one of the seating sections. Every meal comes with soup or salad, garlic bread, free house wine (red or white) and a homemade cappuccino. All for about $25 for the basic half of the menu, up to $35 for some of the fancier options. They only have 25 items on their menu, and I'm sure they make them all exactly like your sweet Italian grandmother would. It was comfort food at it's best. The salad was simple, but a nice start to the meal. The garlic bread was perfect, toasted so it was crunchy on the outside with a garlic mixture and cheese on top. Once the entrees came, we were just so pleased. The portions were hearty, and you could taste the tradition and love that went into the food. It was simple and classic and delicious! The wine isn't incredible, but it's not bad either, and pairs very well with the food (I'm guessing they use the same wine to cook with). And where else on the strip can you get a full meal for $25 that includes all the wine you can drink?!?\n\nThen, the perfect ending to the meal was the cappuccino they bring you (also included). It comes topped with whipped cream and has a lovely flavor (maybe amaretto?) that just made me melt into my seat in our cozy little corner of the restaurant. It was the perfect ending to our meal experience, no additional dessert required (though it's available if you want to add it on). \n\nAnd Gordy! Gordy is the sweet, little (seriously, he is tiny) old man that walks around playing the accordion (and has been since 1981). As he approached our table, I wasn't trying to avoid making eye contact like i would most musicians in restaurants when I'm trying to eat. He was just cheerful and pleasant and adorable. He played a short song for me and my friend and was just cuter than words can describe. \n\nIf you are looking for deluxe, high end italian fusion, Battista's in not the place for you. If you are looking for a great, classic italian meal experience, you don't want to miss this place (my friend said she hadn't had cooking like this since she was in Italy about a year ago). AND, all for a total of about $25! This is definitely on the list of places we will always stop by when we come to Vegas!"

That may seem high, but you get unlimited wine, unlimited bread, your choice of salad or minestrone soup, your entree and a cappuccino. Each meal is pretty large so when we go with 3, we order 2 meals and pay a $13 cover charge. But keep in mind, the extra $13 gets you wine, bread, soup or salad and a cappuccino. I don't understand why people here complain about the wine; they have other options available, so if you're that \"high class,\" then you should be able to pay for your own good wine. This is an awesome flashback to the era of the RatPack. Our absolute favorite is the chicken alfredo. If you're coming for \"high-class wine,\" don't come here.

And the \"pasta side\", unseasoned tomato sauce on overcooked ziti.\n\nThis place is banking on \"free\" soup, bread and wine.  And huge portions of flavorless food.\n\nEven Buca di Beppo is miles above this place. Save your money, at least Buca seasons the food and is not so terribly overpriced."

Hint: go early.\n\nSolid value...Not sure if bad reviews about price are from folks that frequent McDonald's, but I thought price was fine.  We spent more money at a couple casino food courts that had absolutely horrible food....and spent 4 x the price at a steak house that, although good, did not satisfy us like batistas.  \n\nFood and wine were super!  I am not much for wine...my wife is a good bit more discerning in this area...but we both enjoyed the complimentary red and white.  If you have to have high end stuff...buy it...but batistas version is fine and heck, it costs the same amount to have a sip or to have multiple carafs...we chose the latter approach and enjoyed a bunch of red and white...and it tasted better with every sip.  As for the food...we come from a solid Italian community with lots of good home grown restaurants that make olive garden seem inadequate...and we really enjoyed our food at batistas.  I had veal, my wife had some type of shrimp dish... we had a good bit of it before the wine clouded our judgement, and it was well prepared, large portions, and very tasty.  \n\nSo....GO!   You'll love the atmosphere...the pictures, the dark, the small cut up rooms, the garlic bread, the wine, the food, the value, the desert cappacino, and the little ol guy....we will definitely be back!"

I cannot speak for all the plates of food, but the Lasagna that I had was very very good and very large. It was about $25 for the meal, which included the Lasagna, salad or soup, beverage, hot chocolate drink, and unlimited wine. Not too bad. The food was great. The atmosphere is very quaint and cozy. LOTS of trinkets hanging around the place from the many years it has been there. Lots of famous people pictures on the wall with the original owner. Very nice. The servers were amazingly professional and friendly. Fast service for 30ppl was shocking. Everyone had a great time and the overall experience was perfect. \n\nThe only couple of things I can say in a negative light about this joint are as follows,\n\n1. Food was a little expensive even with the unlimited (cheap) wine.\n2. We had to wait a litte longer than expected for our table, however we did have 30 ppl, but we did have a reservation so we were expected.\n\nEven with those little issues, I still think the place is a Woohoo! As good as it gets! Place. Enjoy."

I admit, I was pulled in by the sign...I was given the impression that this was an old school italian joint so I thought maybe the food had a chance.\n\nI'd rather go to Olive Garden and that's pretty sad.  Beware of any restaurant that has a bunch of bullshit on their walls and some dancing monkey doing tricks.  It's usually a sure sign that they're trying to distract you from their mediocre food.\n\nThis is pretty much standard SYSCO food supply.  I ordered the cioppino, my girlfriend got the veal parm.  The cioppino was acceptable, but still a bit bland.  Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.\n\nMy girlfriend's veal was very bad.  Had a strange aftertaste that for me, made it fairly inedible.\n\nEveryone mentions the garlic bread.  Sure, it's good, but it's garlic bread.  If you go to an Italian restaurant and your lasting impression was the garlic bread, the restaurant has failed.\n\nI didn't need the accordion guy.  Again with the gimmicks.  I know people think that guy is cute and funny, etc, but personally, I found him very uncomfortable.  He bets on that uncomfortable to you pass him some money so he'll go away.  I felt kind of bad for him.  In a town where selling your soul for the hustle is standard practice, I didn't need it in my face while I'm trying to have a good meal.\n\nI've been eying this place for a while, so I'm glad I got it out of the way but with all the great restaurants in this city, I felt like I wasted an opportunity."

So take it from me, this place sucks.\n\nWe were staying at Bally's, upgraded to a great suite, having a great time.  Also having fun finding the best low-cost meals (see Ellis Island and Gold Coast reviews).  But we had a hankering for Italian and the restaurant inside the Bally's (for which we had scored 1/2 price coupons) was closed (!).  We had seen Battista's on our way to Ellis Island, and decided to try it, despite not-so-stellar reviews.\n\nThe outside is ugly, but the inside atmosphere isn't bad, typically Italian, pictures on the wall, old menus, photos of old Vegas, whatever.  Oddly, fishing nets on the ceiling -- did this used to be a fish joint?  Impossible to know.\n\nNow one of the problems with this place is -- entrees are expensive.  But, that's because salad and hosue wine are included.  Big deal.  We order, and the waitress asks us if we want red or white.  Me -- white, wife -- red. So she brings two full carafes!  We barely drank 1/10 of each -- there goes most of our money.  The wine wasn't that good, BTW.\n\nThen the fabled little man with the accordion stops by.  Seriously, he is old and bent over.  It's like having Gollum come to your table to play music.  To be honest, he wasn't as creepy or disturbing as we feared, given previous reviews, but he definitely plays a few moments of a tune and then wants a tip.  I gave him three bucks and thankfully he went away permenently.\n\nThen we got our food.  I got fettucine alfredo with chicken, and I did not like it.  It tasted like the kind you would get from Sbarro (a place we had considered) -- not cheesy enough.  Admittedly, the wife really liked her eggplant parmesan.  But I almost immediately started feeling sick.  We got the check, and hopped the monorail to the tropicana to see Bobby Slayton, but by then I was feeling pretty bad and we ended up skipping the show.  We didn't care -- Slayton was a cheap ticket and just a way to fill time. \n\nBut as far as Battista's goes -- I don't recommend it.  There must be better opportunities.\n\nP.S.  Bally's rocks, and for dinner, Ellis Island and the Gold Coast buffet rock."

(Disclaimer: Since they do offer unlimited wine here, please keep this in mind as you read this review.  Due to certain reasons, I may have somewhat of a selective memory.)\n\nI've gone here with big groups on trips to Vegas before we go out.  Always make reservations if you have large groups!  The place is huge, but usually pretty crowded.  \n\nThey have their food menus written on the walls, and they have these meal combinations that include an entree, salad or soup, bread, a hot chocolate type drink, and of course... as much red and white wine as you want!  I believe they range $20-30.  But again I repeat... unlimited wine.\n\nI usually go with the eggplant parmesan, which is delicious.  Cheesy goodness.  Probably a 3.5 star, but gets the job done for a dinner before a night of dancing and drinking.  Other things that friends have ordered just looked okay.\n\nSo I know I keep talking about the wine, but what really stands out to me about this place.... is the first time I went here, they gave us two giant to-go cups of wine!  I'm talking Big Gulp size!  That's the Vegas spirit!"

Nice. \n\nForgot to review it when I was there this week. Absolutely the best Italian place in terms of ambiance and food. The place is old Vegas, clean, and fun. Most of all, they leave you the hell alone without the fake waiter upsell/tip earning crap at a chain restaurant. They don't care what you think, they're just going to bring you the best food imaginable. I suggest everyone order something different--that way you can share. \n\nThe wine is fantastic. People complaining about it being table wine are probably the types of folk that swish $80 cab blends, make up some loosey-goosey adjective about its smokey aromatic legs, and spit it in a bucket at country club events. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life. \n\nMake sure you have $1 or $2 in cash to tip the accordion player. Stop bitching and just do it. He's earned it. \n\nAs spineless as it sounds, get the spaghetti and meatballs. It's cheap and wonderful. The steak pizzaiola is a good backup. Veal parmegiana [sic] is a good 3rd, if you are cool with eating children. I was. \n\nCover that shit in red pepper flake--being Italian in the 21st century means not an ounce of spice in the prep, sadly. It'll kick it up a bit, unless you're the sad sack that thinks sea salt is exotic."

Be sure to keep a few small bills handy to tip Gordy, the restaurant's accordionist.

And honestly we do need more of thesr things in the shadow of Sin City to have a good time. \n\nThe name here is cute but it is not really a whole in the wall.  It's not a dive restaurant. It just happens to be a restaurant off the strip and hidden behind the Flamingo Hilton/Barbary Coast Casinos. \n\nYou will find a wait here. In fact, make a reservation if you can.  This place is simple.  Order a meal and for a fixed price you get salad, main course, cappuccino and all you can drink wine. It is a deal. \n\nI've had many memorable dinners here.  One of my favorites was with my wife, who happened to be my girlfriend at the time. We had a great meal and the carafe's of wine were flying off the table. Honestly by the time we left here, I'm not even sure we ate food. That was the wine talking. Long story short we ended up at the Bellagio with a private concert with Wyclef John. I am going to give Battista's and there bottomless wine the credit here. We must have looked like a fun couple standing in front of the dancing waters.  My words of advice...fun things happen to people having fun!\n\nOkay back to Battista's...the food is not going to win any awards.  It is just basic old school Vegas Italian. If your looking for a 5 star reality show winner chef experience then go somewhere else. This place is about having fun. \n\nI've also had a few work dinners here too and we've had some great times. I attribute that to the wine again. The wine sitting on the table is hard for anyone to resist it. So people who normally don't drink will pour themselves a few wines and why not because its on the house. \n\nI want to mention the accordion player because it is big part of this place.  He is so cute but all he wants is that dollar or two.  He walks from table to table working the whole room. He probably makes a $100,000 per year. I remember once he walked up to our table.  Asked me, \"Where you from kid?\". I said, \"Chicago\". And he jumped in and started playing the song, Chicago by Sinatra.  And when he finished the song he threw out his hand like gimme 5 but he didn't want my hand slapping his unless there was a green bill in it.  This is a novelty here and I think it keeps people coming back for more. \n\nSo if your looking for something different from the usual Vegas Strip drama, then I highly recommend you check this place out. It is a fun time and if your not having fun, then have some more wine!"

That was \"before\" it became a tourist attraction.  In the early days only the \"locals\" knew and supported Bassista's.  Battista himself was there as well as some of his family.  An entertainer would come by and tell \"very naughty\" and also very funny jokes with an Italian flair.  Unlimited wine was also served for one price per person.  The last time I visited was back around 2003.  I was with a very savvy business woman and we ended up in one of the back unused rooms and spoke to several of the original (or close to original) employees.

The wine is what you would expect unlimited house wine to taste like. Having said that, for twenty something dollars, you can have garlic bread, salad (or Minestrone if you're not into the greens), a heaping bowl of pasta, and cappuccino that sort of tastes like maple syrup infused with chocolate (in an absolutely incredible way). Did I mention the unlimited wine part? You can drink loads and loads of wine here - it's light, and refreshing, and though it's not the best tasting, you get used to it. This place is about an incredible experience. It's about taking a breath of fresh air and enjoying a slow and luxurious dinner, filled with wine and a musician who will come to your table and play you a song (he did a rendition of California - like the older song, not the one from the O.C.). It's not just a dinner - it's an experience - one you'll come away loving. And as a bonus, you may not need to pay for food for another 24 hours because you will be stuffed!\n\nBonus - two separate people told us we were a cute couple.

Menu is all inclusive and the prices are just as hearty as the dishes you're eating.\n\nUnabridged:\"Hole in the Plaza\" would be a more appropriate title, but who cares when their front door is made from a huge wine barrel? There are several signs advising reservations but our party of two was seated within five minutes on a weekday night. \n\nPick your entree from the many menus posted on the walls. Just because you went a block off the strip doesn't mean prices are cheaper, but they do include their well-known bottomless wine. One sip of the red (or white) wine will tell you that it is not choice but you can drink copious amounts of it. Get into the Vegas spirit and try to finish your carafe, you could even pour it over your head for a wine shower. It's bottomless so they'll bring you another. \n\nGarlic bread - our first basket was a bit stale but the second one was fresh, warm, and delicious. I went with the minestrone as my appy, my companion went for the salad. The salad was a bit of a let-down, iceberg lettuce and a bit of sliced veggies on top. The soup was hot and while it wasn't astounding, it was a nice starter. My eggplant parm was a huge slab of eggplant/cheesy goodness on a plate. Perhaps it's because I had skipped lunch that day but I was satisfied with my meal. My dining partner got about 2/3 through her lasagna, then threw in the towel. \n\nI don't care for coffee, but I passed my cappuccino to my companion who happily polished off two. She said they were very good.  \n\nTaste-wise Battista's is like a hybrid of Olive Garden and Bucca. Decor-wise it's a bit like a time capsule: signed pics framed on the walls, memorabilia, and the friendly booths that are comfortably broken in from patrons over the years. Our server was cordial and down-to-earth which was refreshing after dealing with aspiring showgirl/gold-digger waitresses earlier in the day. There was an accordion player who we found slightly annoying but the regulars kept requesting him to play bits of songs sprinkled with corny jokes. (I know, I know, I'm heartless cause I didn't find this elderly man's vocation engaging, but I'm trying to chat with my fam while stuffing my face. Accordion's gotta go.)\n\nFor a memorable experience and laid back surroundings, this is it. For mind-blowing Italian cuisine, you may want to look elsewhere. Vegetarians - you're limited to several pasta choices and the eggplant parm. Vegans - pasta pomodoro: that's it."

They have a limited menu, such as they only have one salad dressing, though. It's not family style either, which you kind of assume it will be, so if you want to split add $10. The service is just fine and if you have a reservation you can be in and out quickly. I would go back at some point but I'd rather try several new places before then."

The autographed pictures on the wall of star from bygone era. \n\nThe food was quite possibly the worst Italian food I've ever eaten.  I ordered the cannelloni because it's a dish often served for special occasions. The dish arrives decorated in the green white and red colors of the Italian flag and thoroughly heated through.   The amount of salt in this dish was off the charts!  Two forkfuls into it I was reaching for the water.  When the server came back to ask how everything was i stated that I didn't like my dish because of the salt.   She just said \"okay I'll tell them\" and walked away.  No offer to replace the dish and at the end no offer to remove any part of the dish off the bill.  \n\nI will not return to this place nor do I recommend this place.  Stay away!"

We did not have a reservation, so it was really nice to sit, at the bar, and have a drink while we waited, for a table. \nI guess since we didn't have a reservation, we got the booth we got; in the corner kind of squeezed behind a booth, and next to a table. \nBut, that was fine, since we didn't have to get up too much, since there was no way not to knock into the woman's chair closest, to us. \nThe service was friendly. \nThey have complimentary house wine, which is a very nice touch. If you are picky I am sure you can buy a bottle, as well. \nThere was complimentary garlic bread, too. \nThe house salad was really nice. \nThe Chicken Parmesan was good, but the spinach was incredible. I could have eaten a huge bowl! There was also a side of pasta. \nThe Spumoni dessert was different than I had ever seen. It was like a slice of cake. It was much too cold, and hard. I would have liked it better, if it had sat out for  about 20 minutes. I love Angelo  Brocato's Spumoni, in New Orleans, so I was comparing. \nBut, the star of the meal (dare I say, even better than the spinach) was the complimentary cappuccino. It was out of this world. \nI am glad we went and it was nice, because it was a short walk, from our hotel."

It is a kitschy place, where every square inch is covered by either a photo of a celebrity, a cluster of plastic grapes on a trellis or a drippy candle in a wine bottle. Even before you walk through the front \"barrel\" door (built to resemble half a large wine cask), you are greeted by aroma of garlic and other fine Italian fare.\n\nIt is always busy here....reservations are recommended, especially for a big party. If you don't have reservations, be prepared to wait. (They do have a full bar though, and there is plenty of seating).\n\nNow to the food.....the food varies from various pasta dishes to chicken marsala/parmigan, veal, steak pizziola, fillet mignon, etc. All dinners come with either soup or minestrone soup, a pasta side, all-you-can drink house wine (red or white) and a cappachino for desert. (which is unbelievable.) Maybe my palate gets more sophisticated the older I get, but I used to think that Battista's had excellent food....now I can honestly say, it is just good. \n\nAll in all, I can say that if you have never been to Battista's, you have to at least try it once and then make the judgement call yourself. It definitely is a fun place and a little piece of LV history.\n\nHighlights: Great atmosphere, all you can drink house wine, minestrone, garlic bread, after dinner desert cappachino."

Each meal includes either a salad or minestrone soup, garlic bread, and an after-dinner cappuccino (plus that free wine!) It was really loud and difficult to hear the person talking right next to you, but the quality of the food, and the expertise of our waitress who knew every detail of every menu item and recited them without hesitation upon request made up for that. The cutest old man with an accordion played us a nice little jig as well. Having recently visited Italy, the authenticity of the feast, friends, and fun felt like I was experiencing it all over again. My group thought Battista's looked shady from the outside and it kind of does since it's attached to a liquor store, but we were all pleasantly surprised and impressed.

They'll bring you garlic bread and unlimited house wine along with a side of pasta with your meal. The wine is probably from a box, but it's very drinkable and goes down smooth. Where else in Vegas can you get such a deal? The menu has staples like lasagna and veal parmigiana. It's basic, but very hearty and filling. The servers have it down to a science. These kind of family-run businesses are a rarity. There's a funny accordion player that will work his way to your table. Tip the old guy as he is very charming! I like the vibe of Battista's and I will definitely be back. It's the kind of place to take an old friend, but not a work client you want to impress. My boyfriend and I appreciate kitsch, so it worked for us! We used a coupon and got $10 off $50 or more, so our meal was more than affordable. I just can't believe they made a big deal out of the coupon being on a smart phone instead of printed out when it says on the coupon that you can just show the server your phone.

Carafe of house wine, salad and garlic bread were all great. My true test of any Italian restaurant is the spaghetti and meatballs. Their meatballs were some of the best I've had. Spaghetti could have used a little more sauce? I like a lot of sauce. Asked the pleasant wait staff and they brought me a soup-bowl of extra sauce. I would definitely come back. Seems to be a locals favorite which is always a good sign."

While waiting we were approached and asked if we'd like a drink. When we asked what they had, we were told 'there's a long list on the table behind you' - the table with people sitting at it.  FYI - they have a full bar, but nothing on tap.\n\nSo, the food. Great salad and a yummy hot chocolate they call cappuccino.  The garlic bread and wine that also come with the meal were mediocre. The food was...just ok. I guess when I pay $30 for a bowl of spaghetti I am expecting to get wowed!  Not the case here - and the portion is not a family style portion which would have helped explain the cost.\n\nWe were entertained by the accordian player - sweet, little old man who made us smile and enjoyed the overall ambience of the restaurant. Not sure I would return, or even suggest to it a friend though."

Ok, checked it out. But the food sucked. I'm no chef, and I remember walking out of there thinking, \"I could have made better ravioli than that! And it wasn't even cheap!\" I vowed never to go back.\n\nFast forward to 2015. I read a glowing review of Battista's from Rick Moonen in the LV Weekly, and thought, \"maybe they've changed the food!\" We were in the area a couple weeks ago and decided to return, give it another chance.\n\nThe inside still has that cool mob hangout feel and there's an old guy walking around playing an accordion. That's why they get the 2nd star.\n\nOverview for those who haven't been: everybody orders a \"dinner\" which comes with entr\u00e9e, soup or salad, garlic bread, unlimited house wine, and coffee. If you choose not to order an entr\u00e9e, you still have to pay for a dinner: $19 since you could be cheating and drinking out of somebody else's baby wine glass of $3 wine (what they serve is on par with 2 buck chuck, no question).\n\nI wouldn't even care about the weird setup if the food was actually good. The salad (a handful of lettuce with a piece of salami and shredded carrots on top) came out about the time the words \"I'll have the salad\" were coming out of my mouth. Soup was fine for minestrone. Where they really failed was the entr\u00e9e. I asked the waiter what was their signature dish, but he seemed baffled by the question, and instead asked, \"you mean something you can't get anywhere else? That's the chicken rio.\" Ok fine, I'll take the chicken rio. It's chicken and pasta in a white sauce. Only the chicken is blobby and the white sauce isn't really sauce. More like straight heavy cream they poured on the plate. It seriously has no taste, just a fatty consistency. \n\nMy original review stands: I could make better Italian food at home. Or purchase it at Fresh & Easy and heat it up. And it would be 10 times better. I honestly think they paid Rick Moonen to write that review. Or maybe he got some special food? \n\nInsult to injury: this meal cost me over $30!"

Then you get a choice of minestrone soup or salad. Each order comes with garlic bread, your choice of a side and cappuccino! That's a lot of stuff!! \n\nI don't remember the prices since I came here over a year ago maybe 2, but even if they were high you get so many other items with your meal. The wine isn't the greatest but it comes bundled with your meal so why not. \n\nThey do have an old old man that goes around playing the accordion, it's actually very sweet and comedic at the same time. But I prefer people not to go around soliciting for money and entertainment while I eat.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Parmesan and I believe it was a huge piece of meat. The pasta was just okay, slathered on sauce onto spaghetti noodles. The garlic bread was more just buttered french loaf. Not really a fan of the food.

You can't miss it. But don't even think about driving there, because by the end of dinner you won't be able to drive home. \n\nAtmosphere:  Always crowded. Always a wait. Plan ahead. Seriously. Don't just show up when you're hungry on a Friday evening and think you're gonna waltz right in. Not even on a random Tuesday night. It's always packed with at least an hour wait. Call ahead. \n\nThat said, it's totally worth the wait. Very friendly, cozy, warm atmosphere with a wandering accordion player. Nice touch, that. Not too loud, not too stuffy, no screaming brats. Nothing fancy and it probably hasn't been renovated since well, ever, but it's a nice place for dinner with friends or a long, relaxing date. Just maybe not a first date.\n\nCleanliness/Service: Decent enough service. No issues regarding cleanliness. I've been here half a dozen times and have never had a bad experience.\n\nFood/Drinks: It's not authentic homemade Italian like your Grandma used to make, but it's not high school cafeteria crap either. Huge portions so don't fill up on the bread. Well, unless you're already on your second carafe of wine. Think Olive Garden or Carrabba's quality with unlimited wine. \n\nSo far I've tried the Lasagna, Chicken Parmegiana, and Chicken Rio. They're all good but the Chicken Rio is my favorite. A friend of mine had the salmon (fresh fish of the day) and said it was very good. I keep meaning to try something different, you know, to give a more thorough review, but the Chicken Rio is just so good. Maybe next time. \n\nAnd the after dinner Cappuccino. Best. Cappuccino. Ever. Yum. I mean seriously. I would go there just for that. It's delicious. Very hot chocolate-y. Not sure if it's a legit cappuccino or not, but honestly, who cares?! \n\nPrice: About $28 per person, but that includes your entr\u00e9e, unlimited hot garlic bread, salad or soup, and wine. Yes, wine. House red, house white, or both if you ask nicely. The unlimited wine makes the price much better. It's definitely a good value for the money. You'll never leave hungry. Or sober. \n\nI love this place and try to visit two or three times a year. It never gets old. Don't forget to tip the accordion player to play you a tune. He's old. He might not be there next time."

Wasn't gross but it wasn't super offensive. \n\nEggplant Parmigiana: I just have had better. The red sauce was bland and the eggplant was covered in cheese which was overwhelming. There was soooooooo much cheese.\n\nSide of pasta: literally,  a side dish of penne pasta with more bland red sauce on it. \n\nCappuccino: you know that machine at, like, all gas stations?

Each meal comes with soup or salad, garlic bread, and free wine that is sure to loosen up the group. The meals are fairly priced and the portions will leave you with a satisfied stomach. Every meal also comes with a free cappuccino. From my travels in Italy, their cappuccinos taste more like hot chocolate. But then again, how can you complain when it is included for free?\n\nAlong with the generous portions, Battista's charismatic atmosphere really shines through when the accordion player graces you with his charming presence.

It reminded us of almost an Old Italian mob scene. It was all so interesting to look at and entertaining! I have never been to a restaurant that I found it entertaining just to look at the walls and ceiling. Old black and white pictures covered the walls and they hung pots, pans, and baskets to the ceiling, which I felt gave it a very Italian feeling. \n\nNow the food; AMAZING. Seriously, I don't think I can ever, I mean ever, eat at another Italian restaurant again. First we were offered breadsticks, salad, and soup. The garlic breadstick, to die for! I have never tasted bread that has tasted so delicious; I practically filled up on those before I could even order. For the main course I ordered cheese raviolis. Those where also the best I have ever had. The cheese literally melted in your mouth like butter. I couldn't stop my self from eating! My boyfriend got the eggplant Parmesan. Now that is some good food. I highly recommend that. It is now my favorite dish out of all the restaurants we go too. Its that kind of amazingly perfect good taste that can't be described.\n\nAfter we ate we thought we would go out for desert. That didn't happen though! They brought out delicious cappuccinos. (They are apart of the dinner course so you are not charged for them) They were better then any hot chocolate/coffee/cappuccino I have ever had from anywhere else. It was the perfect amount of sweet and even though I was stuffed I drank the whole cup! (Which is a decent size)\n\nNow I am really ready to go, but wait! It was my birthday and my boyfriend had surprised them and told them when he called for the reservations. They brought out a small piece of cake. AMAZING, AGAIN! It blows my mind that every course of this meal was spot on. It seemed like it was a moist sponge cake with delicious cream on top. I could have eaten like 10 of those.\n\nThe environment was also wonderful. I forget that on the strip people just want to have a good time. So even though we felt like the guests sat to close it was actually worth it. We joked with them and had such a good time. Our waitress was so sweet. I really felt like she took excellent care of us.\n\n\nNow there are two reasons way I did not give this a 5 star. The location is the first. I would have never even known it was there. It is literally a hole in the wall. The area isn't the nicest but I am always paranoid about that.\n\nThe second reason was the \"lives music\". This man would walk table to table and plan a small 2-second snip of a song (of his choosing) and then ask YOU for a tip. I thought it was rude because we didn't ask him to come over so being forced to tip after was a little uncomfortable. I couldn't hear him sing over his accordion so I didn't get to enjoy it anyway. We only had a five so when my boyfriend asked for change back he acted like he didn't hear him and walked away. When he made his second round he made sure not to stop at our table (even though 5 dollars was probably his best tip of the night)\n\nOver all I say GO! We defiantly will be!"

We both ate about 2 bites then stopped eating and waited for our server. \n\nAnd we waited... \n \nAnd we waited ...\n\nAnd we waited...\n\nFinally 15 mins later he comes over and brings the check. Didn't even notice that we didn't eat our food until I spoke up and asked for a manager.  He got kind of insulted when I said we had been there multiple times  before and have never had such a bad experience. He got loud and said \"Oh so what, the food is just horrible?!\" So I responded \"well I wouldn't say it that way.. but yes\". \n\nHe scoops our $100 off the table with the check then comes back 5 mins later and says \"The manager took off your entrees but charged you the cover charge of $13 each. So you got more than half off.\" Throws down the change and walks away. \n\nNo apology from the server and Manager never even came over. \n\nWe paid $28 (after tax) for food we didn't eat. Which comes down to us basically paying $28 for water and bread since we don't drink alcohol so we don't drink the \"free wine\""

I filled out the reservation request and it confirmed us as having a reservation for 2 @ 6pm. \nMy husband approached the hostess at 550 to \"check in\" for our reservation.

I've got a hungry husband, don't think I'm beyond using my OpenTable expertise to our advantage. \nOur server Ryan was very sweet and efficient, even when his section was bustling. \nHusband ordered spaghetti with meat sauce.

It definitely gets a star for environment.  It's like stepping into Old Vegas.  You expect to see Sinatra and his Rat Pack sitting around the corner.  DH and I commented that our parents would have been right at home in this replica of the 1960s Italian hangout.\n\nWe were seated and immediately offered red and white wine.  As the waitress said, \"It's on the house.\"  Of course, it's on the house.  It's common red table wine, a bit vinegary for my taste but what the heck!\n\nImmediately, DH said, \"Look at the tablecloth.\" I glanced down to see old food stains on the tablecloth.  Don't they wash their table clothes??  Yuck!   Should have gotten up and left right there.\n\nWe saw our waitress three times.  When she brought the wine.  When she took our order.  And, when she brought the bill.  The second star goes to the young man who was the bus boy.  He took it upon himself to serve our food and check up on us.  \n\nNow, let's talk food.  Having the menu off the wall was a cute gimmick.  DH ordered the Chicken Cacciatore and I ordered the Manicotti.  His soup was ok but a bit watery with a few veggies floating on it.  I had the salad.  Really liked the dressing that came with it.  A bit strange to see a piece of lunch meat on the top of a green salad, however.\n\nOur entrees came.  Extremely generous portions.  Both of us commented that we could have shared one dish.  DH's chicken had a very interesting sauce on top.  I've never seen an off red sauce on Chicken Cacciatore before. I had a bite and the sauce tasted like it had tons of celery.  DH liked it.  Whatever was placed in front of me was definitely not Manicotti.  Manicotti is a long tube pasta.  I got what looked like a round ravioli filled with way too much ricotta cheese.  We didn't have their dessert drink because it doesn't come decaf.  The nice bus boy brought us decaf coffee instead.  Overall, average food if the prices were low.  But, considering the prices ($20s and $30s), it's outrageously  and inexcusably bad.\n\nFinally, I want to say something about the creepy old man with the accordion.  I know that some people think he's absolutely adorable.  Sorry, I don't share the feeling.  He really made me feel very uncomfortable by leaning into me.  I even told DH to quickly tip him so he could leave us alone.  Thankfully, he never came back for more.  \n\nWe came, ate, and will never come back."

The meals are somewhere in the vacinity of $25-$30/person, but you also get a carafe of house wine. If you are lucky, you can also catch this little short old guy playing the accordion, which makes for a romantic evening. The food is fabulous and you won't leave hungry, that's for sure. \n\nThe place is located right behind Flamingos, so if you are staying on the strip you have to give this place a try."

Food is not good (worst veal parm I have ever had), service sucked (dude was trying to fake an Italian accent, really demeaning) and the wine was horrible (it doesn't matter if its free).  When you are in Vegas you should treat yourself to a quality meal.  Do not come to Battista's because it seems like a great deal (its not).  The money you save on the all-inclusive option just isn't worth it.  There are only a handful of places worth leaving the strip for and this isn't one of the them.

But, as a group of girls on a budget, this place was a pretty good find we split 2 plates between the 5 of us and had enough to eat. The food was pretty good - okay, the bread wasn't great and the included salad sits on a rolling cart until you order, but the pasta was decent. The free wine is a nice addition and the free espresso at the end - is really hot chocolate. \n\nOverall, yes it's touristy and a bit hokey, but compared with all the other rip offs in Las Vegas it's a good meal and a good price."

The salad was just a small  bowl of lettuce w 1 grape tomato, 1 sm olive, a small chunk of cheese, a hard pepperocinni and a slice if salami thrown on top.  There's only one dressing. .Italian, that tastes like cheap Wishbone.  The table wine ..burgundy or chablis..both tasted bitter and cheap.   The garlic bread waa not toasted well so kind of soggy in middle and cold.  We had to srnd it back.  The chicken parmesan was terrible.. dry..hard. fatty on edges and swimming in a marinara that tasted burnt..it even looked brownish.  It csme w what tasted like canned spinach.  We sent entrees back because it was so bad and ordered cheese raviolis instead.  They were no better..the cheese filling was not good quality ricotta..it was swampy and again same burnt sauce. Pasta had a strange consistency. At this point we asked for mgr and rose to leave.  He charged us $14 for the lettuce, bread and sips of the wine.  It was insulting.  But I was glad to leave not paying what would've been a $50-60 bill.  Gladly paid for good food but not for that slop.  I'm italian and that was a far cry from good italian cooking.  Needless to say. We will NEVER be back and will warn everyone we know.  It's sad because at one time it was great..my fav dish has been linguini w clams which used to be all big fresh clams niw the waiter told me you get 4 in shells the rest are chopped and probably canned for $36.  Bottomline this place is now a huge Rip off!! Tourists must be sustaining it."

Their sauce is the blandest red sauce ever. It came with some kind of revolting spinach goo.  The salad is served in plastic bowls. The garlic bread has some kind of grainy butter paste spread on it. Every dinner is served with plastic covers on scary metal hospital carts. The after dinner cappuccino tasted like burnt caramel.  After they had taken our plates, we asked for more wine and were told the \"free\" wine only comes with dinner, so don't make that mistake. Better yet, DO NOT EAT HERE EVER."

Having just been in NY a couple of weeks before, I was looking forward to seeing how the food compared to by Patsy's Italian Restaurant NY experience which was amazing! I have to say, it really didn't compare. The free red wine was not good at all. It had a vinegar taste. No one at the table liked it. I didn't get to try the white though. I ordered lasagna which the waiter said he thought was the best thing on the menu. I have to say...it was pretty delicious. The side of meatballs I got were average. No one else was thrilled with their main dishes either. The meals where a good size, so if you're not ravenously hungry, I suggest splitting a meal ($10 fee) with a side of meatballs or sausage."

I never actually heard if it was good or not, and never bothered to try it out. \nThis past weekend, my aunt and her friends were in town and one of them likes this place and made a reservation for us to eat there before seeing a show. \nI had the option of joining them for dinner or just meeting them at the show...well, I wish I would have just skipped dinner at this place and gone to the show. \nI love Italian food and grew up with real Italian food being cooked by my grandmother.\nI really have no idea how some people are giving this place 5 stars. \nI was really confused at the menu--it's posted up on the wall and I had to crane my neck to look at it from my seat so I just settled on spaghetti and meatballs.\nThe meal comes with a side salad, wine, garlic bread, your entree, and a cappuccino.\nThe wine was not that good. But I figured since it was included in the price. The white tasted something like grape juice and the red seemed watered down. \nThe salad actually made me laugh---1 grape tomato, 1 black olive, 1 piece of salami, 1 chunk (yes, chunk) of cheese, mixed greens, and to be honest, I'm not sure if there was any dressing on it or not.\nThe bread was okay, nothing special but it was more like slices of toast than what you normally get at a restaurant for garlic bread.\nWhen I got my spaghetti and meatballs, I was disappointed to say the least. The sauce was bland--needed garlic and more seasonings. The meatballs left something to be desired. I got spaghetti and meatballs because it is such a fail-safe dish. I honestly make better spaghetti and meatballs myself. I make my sauce, pasta, and meatballs all from scratch so I know it can be done and be good. This tasted like a TV dinner.\nLastly, the cappuccino. I don't normally drink cappuccinos, so I will be honest and say that I might not be the best critic of this part of the meal, but I feel like it tasted like it came from a mix. It was overly sweet and for some reason made me think of Honey Maid graham crackers. \nAlso, during our meal Gollum (perfect description by reviewer below) did come over to play the accordion for us which was more annoying than anything and I did my best not to laugh.\nOverall, I wish I just passed on this place and if I want Italian food I will either just make it myself or find a better place even if it is a chain restaurant (sadly, most chains I can think of would have been a better bet)."

Paid $23 for cheese tortellini with \"meat sauce\".  With that you get a salad, garlic bread, and their house wine (red wine vinegar, perhaps?).  My pasta had clearly been sitting in a vat too long, and there was no meat to be found in the sauce.  I could have done better with a bag of frozen pasta and a jar of Ragu, and I hate Ragu.\n\nSeriously, I don't know why anyone who reads these reviews would come here.  Dining in Vegas can be pricey and it can be bad, but at Battista's you get both in one visit."

We showed up with a group of 6 with no reservation and it was a wait to get a table - so do make a reservation if you can. Took about 40 minutes to get seated.\n\nOur server was very nice and she helped get the food out quickly as we had a show to see.  The linguine and clams in white sauce was very good (although they offer it in red sauce as well, which seems odd to me) and full of tender bits of clams. The garlic bread that comes with the meal was also excellent. None of the table were real wine drinkers so the wine sadly went mostly untouched. It would be nice to opt out of the table wine.  The minestrone soup was just ok.\n\nReally loved the atmosphere and decor here - very kitschy, lots of celebrity pics on the walls.

It looks a little shady at first, right next door to a liquor store in a strip mall. But the staff were all very nice, and we were seated right away (at 7 pm on Friday night). \n\nYou can't beat the value- there are tiers to the menu, depending on your entree. I got the ziti with pomodoro sauce, which was the lowest tier at $21.95. The pricier options include steak and veal and can go as high as $38.95. Whatever entree you choose, it comes with house wine, garlic bread, soup or salad, and cappuccino.\n\nThe garlic bread was delicious and plentiful (we went through two baskets...there were two of us). The salad was great, surprisingly large and had great leafy greens, not just a bag of iceberg dumped into a bowl. My pomodoro sauce wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either. The cappuccino WAS amazing. So, so good. My mom who doesn't ever drink coffee/espresso tried a sip and we ended up splitting it.\n\nThe real attraction is the ambience and the adorable accordion player, Gordy. He found out we were from Missouri and played the Missouri waltz for us! Very sweet and he gives the place a lot of character.\n\nThe food is nothing earth-shattering but it's all tasty and you get SO much for the money. Definitely check it out, if only to be serenaded by Gordy."

Tender, light, flavorful.  The minestrone soup was great too, and the garlic bread...well...thankfully someone moved it away from me, or I would have eaten the whole basket. \n\nI stole a bite of tortellini from a friend, along with a bite of shrimp scampi, and manacoti (what, it was my night, I can eat all the things if I want to!!) and all of them were great.

My husband I chose classics: manicotti and cheese ravioli- $25.95 each. They tasted frozen and processed- not authentic. \n\nEach meal comes with a house salad, red and/or white House wine, garlic bread and a cappuccino.  The salad was so-so. It has a slice (like you would get at the deli counter) of salami in it with a hunk of processed mozzarella cheese and is slightly overdressed.   The wine was for sure cheap, but I wasn't expecting anything fancy considering it was included. The meal, depending on what you picked, doesn't take too long to get there but again, isn't anything to write home about.  It seemed like previously frozen, processed pasta- not homemade- with processed cheeses and canned sauce. I've had better at chains. The garlic bread wasn't fresh- seemed like it had been sitting a while and was hard. I tasted the cappuccino and it was ok but had a strong nutty flavor, almost like pecan. \n\nAgain, the 2 stars are for the ambiance and the accordion player than came by our table to entertain.   It's Vegas- there are so many places with much better food for the same price."

I have been coming here once a year or more for almost 20 years and it never changes.  Ever.  This is a good thing.  Prices really aren't that bad for what you get especially when you look at many other choices in Vegas.\n\nI just have to laugh and shake my head when I see bad reviews of this fun little place.  Oh boo hoo the wine isn't top shelf, the waiter took too long, the prices are too high.  Seriously?  Take the stick out of your ass, try to smile and enjoy this gem of a restaurant for what it is.  It is a legendary, fun, kitschy, classic old Italian restaurant that isn't trying to be something it's not.\n\nRelax, and take some time to look at all the decor and pictures on the walls.  Everyone from Elvis to Ol' Blue eyes to Liberace and everyone in between has eaten here.  That's just cool old school.  Soak in the ambiance and the low lighting,  Get tipsy with the free wine.  Yes, the 2 full carafe's of both red and white wine and the bread is FREE.\n\nThe dinner is standard Italian fare and is always delicious if not predictable.  The bread is always fresh and the bring you a nice cappuccino to complete your meal.  \n\nThe very best part of eating at Battista's however is Gordy.  This 90+ years young gentleman is the salt of the earth.  He will play you a song on his accordion that will make you smile every time, guaranteed.   Wearing a baseball cap?  He will play take me out to the ballgame.  Feeling romantic, he will play That's Amore.  Wonderful man and a treasure in Las Vegas."

There's also a sweet older gentleman that walks around playing the accordian at each table--and he takes requests! \n\nThird, the food is amazing. We were informed by our waiter that it does take awhile to make and get your food because they do take their time and ensure that everything is done correctly and deliciously. The food was indeed awesome. We are big garlic lovers, so to us, even the (unlimited) garlic bread was pristine. What was very cool about this place is that literally everything is included in the price of your meal--unlimited red and white house wine (Burgundy and Chablis) carafes,  garlic bread, your choice of soup or salad, and a delicious cappucino to finish the meal. I was sold on the fact that I could essentially have my own personal carafe of red wine since no one else at our table drank.\n\nIt was an all around wonderful experience.

Not Food Channel Celebrity Chef Italian, which most pretentious Vegas posers desire, but good italian food.  You do not leave here hungry.  The garlic bread, soup, salad, all the free sides are good, once again, if you are going to criticize the comps, don't eat them, get something else.  It used to be perfectly priced but the prices have gone up or they would get 5 stars.  This is a place to go if you happen to find yourself in the city of posers and wannabe's."

It is an easy 10 minute walk from the back of the Flamingo over to Battista's.\n\nAll of the staff were friendly and the unlimited wine is certainly nice. I had my own carafe of red wine and my wife had her own of white. It is not great wine, but it is unlimited.\n\nThe food is pretty good, but the prices are a bit high, even with the unlimited wine. The other thing stuck in my mind from our visit was the proximity of the tables to each other. We could hear the entire conversation of the couple at the table across from us."

This place is essentially the palace of hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Such a wonderful eclectic mix of stuff as I have never seen outside of Midwestern Cracker Barrel-esque restaurants. It practically carries you off to another place! But let's talk food for a minute. The garlic bread. Best I've ever had, hands down, anywhere. The antipasto salad? Very delicious. Red or white wine with your meal? The wine is okay, but the presentation gives you that authentic experience which goes above and beyond flavor. And the pasta itself? A classic testament to Italian cuisine, with perfectly complimentary flavors. The cappuccino at the end of our meal was the perfect touch, though I wish it had come with a cannoli. My only critique? Don't eat here if you are cutting back on sodium. Holy meatballs batman, I loved the flavor, but was it ever salty. Make no mistake though, we'll be back!"

The garlic bread was greasy and don't get me started on the cappuccino that was just a water down sugary instant coffee mix of some sort...\n\nNow for the main dish. I had the veal parmigiano. It was really big but a bit soggy and the breading was thicker than the meat itself. The side dish of pasta marinara was so small my 21 month old son ended eating all of it as well my husband's and still wanted more. At least he enjoyed it, but I couldn't tell you how they were cooked since I didn't have not one bite, that's how small it was...\n\nI'm very disappointed and would not go back there again!

This is how the conversation goes with the waiter ~\n\nWaiter: White or red?\nMe: Both please\nWaiter: (laughs) So you've been here before...\n\nYou get wine with your meal & I'm happy to say that I've never once left here not tipsy :) \n\nDoes the food taste better when you're tipsy? Sure it does...\n\nWe always order the same two meals; cheese ravioli with a marinara sauce and Chicken Rio (chicken breast smothered in a creamy white sauce over noodles and veggies on the side). Both are usually good but on this last trip both were barely warm and our chicken dish had hardly any sauce on it. Each meal comes with a soup or salad and we get one of each. My man gets the minestrone which was sent back this time because it was lukewarm & poorly seasoned and I get the salad which is really consistently great. This time I noticed they added croutons which is unnecessary and they were so hard that one of them left a little cut in my mouth :( \nPlease get rid of these hard croutons....\n\nThe garlic bread is fantastic here and always comes out straight out of the oven and you also get sweet cappuccinos with whipped cream for dessert. I love the sweet ending! Let me also mention the old school ambiance that looks like a hoarders dream. I dig it and it's fun and on the dark side which is always extra romantic. \n\nService has always been great and not sure what's going on in the kitchen but we hope they get it together. We might give it another chance but no more after the next try if things don't improve."

I didn't try it but he said it was good.  Both our entrees (lasagna, chicken parmesan) were fine, but nothing to write home (or a yelp review?) about.  The bread was pretty good.  \"Cappucino\" or as other reviewers have correctly identified it - Swiss Miss was not hot... not even warm actually.  I guess they fill the mugs in large batches?  How hard is it to pour a cup when it's time to serve it?  \n\nWe went through a carafe of the white and a glass or two of red before hitting the dusty trail back to Bill's Gamblin Hall.\n\nAnyway, I like this place... but come on - $22 for lasagna and $26 for chicken parm?  Who are they kidding?  I'd rather pay a more reasonable fee (knock off $10) and then pay a separate price for all you can drink wine.

He mentioned at least a pound of succulent little morsels of clams over a full pound of linguini. It was our last night in Vegas, and frankly, I was sick of buffets.\n\nWe arrived, and if I hadn't been shown how to find this place I would have never found it, It literally is a hole in the wall. But when you enter the place is a full sized eatery. It's like Bucca De Beppo without the clutter. \n\nOur waiter arrived just seconds after being seated, dressed in black pants and a white shirt, slicked back hair, looking around, all the waiters looked like clones of each other. With him were two carafes of wine, red and white. Then he expertly explained the daily specials, including an eggplant lasagna that sounded amazing. But I had my heart set on this amazing linguini with white clam sauce. John ordered the eggplant lasagna, and I ordered the Linguini, and we said we'd share since the portions were so huge. John also got a meatball.\n\nWe sat a bit talking about our success at the blackjack table and how we were always so close on the Roulette table. I had a good day at the sports book, picking the Steelers over the Browns (duh) and picking the rams and teasing them with Buffalo. So yeah, I was picking up the tab. Not bad wine for being free. Garlic bread was delivered, nice and cheesy, garlic out the wahzoo! Very good indeed.\n\nOur waiter arrived with two HUGE, oversized bowls, one containing my linguini, the other the eggplant lasagna. and two smaller plates for us to share. (no extra charge for sharing!) Can I say I come from a big Italian family, I saw my father eat healthy amounts of pasta at one setting, but I had never seen a bowl of linguini with clams as big as this for one person. I even said to the waiter \"are you sure this is mine and not for a table of four?\" He assured me this was a single serving. I swear it was over a pound of pasta and a pound of clams. Fresh grated Ramono cheese was dusted over the top, and plenty of cracked pepper. He even left the cheese grater and a healthy block of cheese at the table for us to help ourselves.\n\nThe pasta was perfectly al dente, a bit of bite and wonderful flavor from the clams. The clams were very tender, meaty and succulent. John's Eggplant Lasagna was very dense, flavorful, but a bit greasy from frying the eggplant. There was a lot of different cheeses used, I could taste ricotta, Parm, Romano, and a smokey cheese, maybe Provolone? Aside from the grease, it was delicious, rich and tasty. The meatball was very dense, stuffed with all kinds of fresh herbs and garlic. It was easily six ounces.\n\nBattista's is a great place in a great city, after you've had your fill of buffets and quick bites, go have a wonderful sit down meal at an Italian restaurant that does it right."

It's not the cheapest place in town (Meals start at about $20) and it's absolutely no good if you don't like cheap wine. But, if you can afford it, and you like cheap wine... This is it! There's even a strolling accordion player named Gordy to serenade you during your meal. You get your choice of standard Italian entrees (My favorites are the Lasagna and the Veal Parmigiana) and meals include, salad, great garlic bread, your entree, hot chocolate (they call it a cappuccino, but it's hot chocolate) AND, oh my god, are you sitting down for this? ALL THE CHEAP WINE YOU CAN DRINK!!! They'll ask you if you like white or red. If you're smart, one person at the table will say \"red\" and someone else will say \"white\", that way they'll bring two carafes right off the bat... then they just keep bringing them! Oh, you'll feel so sick in the morning!"

From the atmosphere, to the food, to the adorable gentleman playing the accordion, it is a fun, reasonably priced unique experience off the craziness of the strip. \nWe loved the eggplant parmigiana and lasagna, both in generous servings, and the included bread and soup were tasty as well. The did I mention the included wine? The cappuccino was so amazing, we almost went back later for another cup! We will definitely be returning to Battista's on our next Vegas trip."

The meat was dry like the chicken lay dead for weeks before being seared on what can only be a grill in need of a bad cleaning. The pasta was slimy as if it were oatmeal left on the counter for the starchy skin to develop.  \nIt was Mother's Day, so we were all behaving. But when the conversation turned to the dishes served we were all disappointed. Finally, I ordered the cannoli. Hard crusty and glazed over as if it had been previously frozen. I used one finger, pressed on it, and it shattered like glass. The only good note was the food was so bad, after speaking to the manager, he comped what little bit we could stomach.  My advice; don't go!"

I am very picky when it comes to Italian and Mexican food as I am both and was raised on authentic Mexican and Italian food and also lived in Italy and Mexico but I always give new places a shot. So here it goes, \n\nI was very disappointed in the food as well as the lay out of the seating, when they seat you you are basically sitting with the table next to you in like a small room, I didn't get to witness the little hi who goes around playing music but I doubt that would of change my opinion about the place, the food was ok, nothing impressive, I had a steak that I honestly felt like I could of cooked it in my back yard and thrown some sauce on it. You get complimentary house wine but trust me no one is going there for the wine, my girlfriend who loves wine had to have her wine with water after every drink she took ( never seen anyone do that before ) so yeah the wine, not good. The coffee at the end was ok but again no one is going there just for that, I also felt everything was over priced but it makes sense because they really are charging you for their \" complimentary \" wine and coffee, at the end of the night I was disappointed but was happy I tried it because it's one of those Las Vegas things you have to do, I wouldn't go back or recommend it but if you are one those people who just has to cross it off your things to do in Las Vegas list then go for it."

The free salad, bread, cappuccino and wine struck me as a quantity-over-quality gimmick.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The wine isn't winning any contests, but is drinkable.  The salad was lightly dressed and crisp.  The bread was fresh-baked and tasted of yeast and garlic.  The lasagna I ordered wasn't the best I've ever had--noodles were overlooked, but the filling was delightful.  We loved the dark, dusky atmosphere, and appreciated the attentive service.

Either way, there's lots to see and take in.\n\nThe menu is simple, and contains simple Italian food. And yes, everything comes with bread, wine, and soup or salad.

What a steal, as I said, in the middle of the strip! All the menu says is that there's a $10 minimum per person, so why not split all that yummy simple Italian food!\n\nThis was one of our favorite meals from our last trip. The energy, the location.

Note that actual \"hole in the wall\" restaurants don't name themselves as such.  Similar to how girls named \"HotChick6969\" in AOL chat rooms were rarely actually hot, or even chicks, for that matter.\n\nAnything a block from the strip is not geared towards locals.  If you really want a locals experience, you have to get far enough from the strip to where you can't walk back without your legs hurting.\n\nThe food is mediocre.  Not horrible, but if you're expecting a solid, surprisingly good meal from a hidden Italian locals joint, you're going to be disappointed.\n\nI remember when I came in and found out about the free wine.  My heart sank when I heard that.  I knew the wine would be terrible if it was free.  Indeed, it wasn't good.  I didn't even order a second glass.  I felt weird NOT drinking it, because it was included in the price.\n\nLook, if you just want to visit for the accordions and the funky photos on the wall, have at it.  But just remember, someone set this place up in order to draw in dumb tourists walking down Flamingo, who think they're finding some hidden gem off the beaten path.  It's just not what it portrays itself to be, and I think that's what bothers me the most."

We quickly ordered and were given our delicious garlic bread and salads (can also get soup). The atmosphere was great but a little too dark making it hard to read the menu and really take in the surroundings. Our food came very quickly and wasn't bad. I expected the food to be a little more than it was but it was tasty. I would have to say that the best part of the meal was the homemade cappuccino you get at the end of the meal. If I could drink that daily I would! Heaven in a cup!"

It's very old school Italian you feel like home. The d\u00e9cor looked fun first think I spotted out was the wall of tiny liquor bottles from all over the world. It was pretty cool. Then when they seat you it's not one big open restaurant it's kinda sectional stations kind interesting but seems not private. They give you free house red or white wine which was decent I mean come on its free. The over all experience was nice I'd recommend it to anyone."

The decor is kitchy...very old corny Italian place with a wall full of shot glasses and small liquer bottles, stuffed moose, turkey and other items.  \nThe service was QUICK and much appreciated.  The staff was helpful and nice.  The overall idea is, I think, what Bucca tries to achieve.  The menu's on the wall...I ordered eggplant...yumm-o for the most part.  All dishes come with house wine (complimentary), garlic bread, salad or soup, entree, a pasta side (if pasta's not already somehow included in the dish) and cappucino.  Salad was not tasty at all...garlic bread was OK...eggplant was outstanding, pasta was ok, cappucino had yummy whipped cream on it and that's about all I have to say.  Oh,....the red wine was great.  All this for about $25 per person.  \nThe BEST part was the little old guy playing the accordian table to table.  He asked what we were celebrating and then sang \"Get Me to the Church on Time\".....best 2 second show of my life. \nOverall...I MAY return if someone really begs for it."

This hidden gem is located behind the hotels next to a liquor store/bar. We stayed at the Flamingo and we were able to walk to the restaurant. We made same day reservations and arrived a bit before our time. We were able to enjoy a drink in the bar area. \nThe restaurant is dark, decorated with old photos on the walls, the menus are posted on the walls. The restaurant is divided into rooms. We got a nice little cozy table in a corner. We were brought over water, the server asked what kind of wine we wanted, red or white, we went with both. After he took our order warm, delicious, garlic bread was brought to us. OMG I could have skipped dinner and just eaten the bread. YUM! Our meals came with a soup or salad and we both went with the house salad. It was very good. \nI went with the chicken Alfredo and it was on point. My bf had a steak caruso dish and he was impressed with it. It had tender pieces of steak with saut\u00e9ed veggies. We both enjoyed our meals and I can honestly say that it was the best meal I had in Vegas. At the end of our meal we got complimentary cappuccinos that were to die for.\nThe cozy atmosphere, great home cooked pasta, great service, dining in an establishment that has been there for 40 yrs, I was in heaven.  We also got serenaded by a cute little old man playing the accordion. \nI highly recommend you try this hole in the wall place while in Vegas, you will not be disappointed!"

Never, not once! \nThe food was just OK, a C minus, D plus. \nWe are locals here in Las Vegas and dine out all the time at fabulous restaurants and some of them a good bit less expensive than this place. $68.00 with no beverages and no desserts.

            "review": "Unlimited wine? I'm in 100%. I'm aggrieved that I wasn't informed about this enticing deal sooner. Located off Flamingo and the Linq, Battista's Hole in the Wall has all the character of an old school Italian restaurant. The entryway makes you feel like you're in a giant wine barrel, and the area by the host stand is a feast for the eyes. From floor to ceiling, Battista's is lined with interesting tid bits and knick-knacks (like an extensive collection of mini liquor bottles!). Lighting is dim and like any good Italian joint, patrons are greeted with the sound of raucous laughter and conversation. Reservations are a must - we arrived on a Tuesday evening with reservations at 8PM. We were lucky to find parking in the crowded lot. Amid the hustle and bustle, we ended up being seated at 8:15PM. \n\nCHEESE MANICOTTI ($25.95): Like all meals on the menu, this entree comes with a salad or minestrone soup, garlic bread, unlimited house red and white wine, and a cappuccino at meal's end. I opted for the salad as my starter, which was heavily dressed in Italian and had sparse toppings (1 olive, 1 slice of mozzarella, 1 sweet pepper, etc.). Though lacking creativity, the salad was fine. The accompanying garlic bread was warm, fresh, and delicious. The manicotti was served with a side of creamed spinach, which helped to break up the overwhelming amount of cheese on the manicotti. Instead of being served in wine glasses, guests are provided with small shot-like glasses to use for the wine. Kind of odd, but after a few glasses I cared not. The cappuccino was a sweet treat that I enjoyed every second of. 4/5\n\nCHICKEN RIO ($29.95): \"Superb\" according to my husband. He said the sauce was quite similar to jagerschnitzel sauce. Served with a side of shredded zucchini. He'd order the same thing again! He didn't leave a speck of food left on the plate and was so full he couldn't drink any more wine. 5/5\n\nSERVICE: Food came out quickly and in order. The waitress was a bit over flirtatious but she took care of us overall.     \n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nOn the whole, I rather enjoyed my meal. I wouldn't order the manicotti again, but will definitely come back to order another menu item at Battista's. For an Italian meal with Vegas panache, you can't beat the deal Battista's offers. Dinner for two cost $60 pre-tip, a bargain for Strip prices.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #13"

I have read reviews about the garlic bread. It was good, but just that. The free wine that everyone likes. I thought the red was terrible and the white was less than average. I didn't expect Napa, but this wine was not good. I had Veal Parmasaen and it was over cooked and over sauced. The sauce bothered me the entire evening, way too much paste. It was awful and for the price I was just bewildered how this establishment is still around. My wife couldn't finish her food (Seafood Pasta) and my friend made negative comments about his dish. Service was good.  I'm sure this place has it's loyal customers and maybe it used to be a good place, but I'll never eat here again."

We came for dinner last night around 7:00pm because who doesn't love Italian food right? It was very very busy though. \n\nI ordered the lasagne which was just mediocre. Portion was huge I probably only ate a quarter of it. My hubby got chicken Alfredo which was DELICIOUS!!!!! Definitely recommend that. My mom got linguine with clams and garlic. And her husband got the NY steak. The noodles were okay but my mom really didn't enjoy the fact they didn't have any freshly grated Parmesan cheese or freshly grated cracked pepper. And the steak was supposed to be well done but came out medium and almost raw.\n\nAlso they never took our drink order I had to personally ask for iced tea and waters even though the table next to us was asked immediately after being seated what they want to drink.\n\nGarlic bread is very good!!! My daughter ate about 7 pieces instead of touching any pasta. The salad had waaaay too much vinegar my tongue felt very tangy after each bite. The minestrone was great though!!! \n\nFor desserts we ordered a spumoni and tiramisu for the birthday boys! The spumoni was delicious. The tiramisu however, not so much. It was made with layered yellow cake instead of sponge fingers and I hated it!!!! Didn't taste anything at all like tiramisu and I know my tiramisu. Not even a strong coffee taste at all.\n\nThe one thing I did really enjoy was the bottomless white wine as well as the cappuccino that comes with dinner!!! The cappuccino was soooooo good I drank two. And probably 3 or 4 glasses of the white wine."

An added feature of note is the accordian player who makes his rounds serenading each table.  While I'm not a big fan of musicians performing at my table, this old dude is a real gem."

            "review": "I can honestly say this was the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life. And I don't even have high standards. All I need is mildly decent service and pretty good, inexpensive food. This place didn't even come close to that. It was seriously laughable. \n\nFor starters, there isn't a normal menu. It's this weird small menu stuck to the wall that is crazy overpriced and the food wasn't even mildly decent to justify it. You have to order an entree dish and it comes with garlic bread, soup or salad, some pasta dish, a coffee, and a complimentary glass of red or white wine. No a la carte or appetizers possible. \n\nOur waiter was the most socially awkward person ever. He didn't make eye contact and would walk away from our table as we were placing our orders. We would start talking to him and he'd start walking away from the table every time mid-conversation like he had somewhere else really important to be and he couldn't be bothered with us.\n\nI kind of feel like we were on the show boiling point from\nMTV. We kept expecting someone to pop out with a camera telling us it was all a huge joke. It was that uncomfortable. When we finally got our food, our waiter forgot our complimentary wine and when we asked if he was going to bring it he stared aimlessly over our heads and responded saying yeah, like he was really confused and then finally brought it over. We also asked for bottled water and he brought us a carafe of tap water when we specifically asked for bottled water.  Also, even if you aren't eating, if you have a bite of someone else's food they charge you $13.... Wtf is that?\n\nThere was a 70 year old man who came to each table serenading you with his accordion hoping for a tip which was just so sad and awkward. It made us feel so uncomfortable especially when he finished and none of us had cash. So weird. We just wanted to eat real quick, no serenade needed. The food was nothing special either. My boyfriend ordered the meatball dish and asked our waiter to have his meatballs cut into smaller pieces and they came in full form. So clearly the waiter didn't listen to his request at all. Also, we never received any side pasta dish like the menu said you would get with your entree. (Not like we wanted it anyways with how horrible the food quality was). But still, you expect to get what you pay for. \n\nAll in all this place had horrible food, extremely unprofessional staff and made us very uncomfortable. Do yourself a solid and go elsewhere."

It starts with the stuffed moose head over the receptionist's station dubbed, \"Moose-olini\" and spreads to the walls filled with tiny airline-sized bottles of booze, pictures of celebrities and anything else one can think of except the kitchen sink. Who knows everything that is stuck in the ceiling. I was almost afraid to look. One thing I am sure of--it's all been there for a very long time.\n\nENTERTAINMENT:\n\nA tiny, wizened, ancient little man who is seemingly dwarfed by his big accordion. He comes around every half hour for about two minutes, plays very badly (in a \"it's so bad it's great\" sort of way), panders shamelessly for tips and then disappears (probably to get oxygen and rebuild his strength for another two minute appearance a half hour later).\n\nRef: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w?select=jJQ-WqpZTRkjYGSqFF-nyQ\n\nCONCEPT:\n\nCharge double the value for run-of-the-mill Italian meals that are posted on a board and then try to compensate with free vino by the carafe. In a similar vein to Olive Garden, you can stuff yourself with unlimited garlic bread too. If you drink enough wine and chow down on the garlic bread, you'll enjoy the accordion serenades, go away full, and really not care about the quality of the meal and the price tag. If you're with good friends, it probably will be an enjoyable experience.\n\nOUR EXPERIENCE:\n\nWe walked over to this little hole in the wall before a Penn and Teller show based on our concierge's recommendation. We drank the \"free\" wine, ate a lot of garlic bread, sang a lot of \"Happy Birthday's\" to various folks in the room, listened to the little old man butcher \"O Sole Mio\", and ate pasta dishes. I ordered linguini chopped clams in a white sauce for $26.95. The other dishes were all priced in the mid-twenties. My clams and linguini were of the $11.95 caliber. The wine was simply bad.\n\nIn summary, Battista's must have a very good working concept to stay in business for over 3 decades. That concept just doesn't work for me. I'd even recommend the place for those in a Monty Pythonish mood and looking for \"something completely different.\" If this is the case, just go in with the right expectations which shouldn't be centered around their culinary excellence.\n\nBattista's was the only recommendation by our excellent concierge that I don't heartily endorse."

I grew up on Italian, home-cooked food, I've spent a month in Italy and literally ate my way through the country, and have an eleven-letter Italian last name that people constantly butcher when they try to pronounce it.  It is that experience that prompted me to sign up for Yelp and give Battista's its deserved one star. It was dismal. \n\nThe main reason I am writing this is to dispel myths circling around (from LOCALS no less) that this place is fun and has good Italian food. Neither is true. Though our wait staff was attentive and prompt, the good service we got just didn't outweigh the bad food. \n\nThe decor is kitschy - crap all over the place. The food pricing is way too expensive for iceberg salad, adequate garlic bread and mediocre wine. I ordered a chicken dish and had minestrone. They were both way too salty (a trick used by restaurants to hide poor quality or good-tasting food). And yes, the accordion player was awkward to say the least. \n\nOver-priced, overrated and a tourist trap with a miraculously good reputation. My advice? Go to Maggiano's for GREAT Italian food.

Surprisingly, it's my second dining experience in the last two months that involved time travel.  First, there was the world famous West Shore Diner . . . (http://www.yelp.com/biz/west-shore-diner-lemoyne#hrid:DHBdTFfMrO-QCOqxjxFx1Q), and now - Battista's.  Holy flux capacitor, Batman!\n\nWe came here at 5:30 pm last Monday, because my friend had a coupon for a free dinner for two.  Didn't I tell you it helped to know the right people?  The restaurant brags about its \"hole in the wall\" appeal right in its name, although in reality it is much nicer than that.  This restaurant is located directly behind The Barbary Coast, or Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon as it's known today.  Battista's even has its own parking lot - enter on Audrey St off Flamingo Rd.\n\nWhen you walk inside, you feel like an Applebee's opened a new location inside Abe Lincoln's Log Cabin.  There are so many tchotchkes on the walls, you don't know where to look first.  The gems of their trinket collection, in my humble opinion, were tiny liquor bottles neatly arranged inside a glass cage.  The \"Maximum occupancy: 8,000 people\" and \"Parking for Italians Only\" sign were nothing compared to the sign above the urinals in men's bathroom: \"Your future is in your hands.\"\n\nWe were seated at a large table with red vinyl chairs and a white tablecloth.  The waiter came by with the menus and waters, although the menu was posted on the wall.  It looks as though it hasn't changed since the 1960s anyway.  You can only get complete dinners here.  You pick your entree, and the rest is included.  The entrees range in price from $20.95 to $31.95, depending on what you choose.  Since our meal was free, I went with the more expensive option of veal parmigiana for $29.95.\n\nYou meal includes a salad or a cup of minestrone soup, garlic bread, a side of pasta, a post-meal cappuccino and unlimited house wine, red or white.  \"Hold on a second!  Did he say 'unlimited wine???'\"  He sure did.  I don't know anything about wine, but I'd venture a guess it's not the best wine you've ever tasted.  Still, you can't beat the price.  FREE is FREE.\n\nThe meal also includes a serenade by a 5' 3'' 75-year-old man with an old accordion.  The serenade is pretty much a must, since there's nothing you can tell him that would stop him from singing it.  Hey, he works for tips.  We weren't on a date, but he still said he had \"something special for the beautiful lady.\"  So, I was guilted into paying $2 for a so-horrible-that-it's-funny rendition of:\n\n\"When you're smiling, when you're smiling,\nThe whole world smiles with you;\nWhen you're laughing, when you're laughing,\nThe sun comes shining through.\"\n\nThe food wasn't very good.  I'd say it's Olive Garden quality at Las Vegas prices.  My veal parmigiana was tasteless with loads of cheese on top.  The garlic bread had so much butter, I am surprised it didn't seep right through the basket.  The salad was pretty good, and the cappuccino was delicious.\n\nI'd go there in a second for a free meal.  However, now that I've tried it, I wouldn't rush back.  You have to go at least once though."

He did the bare minimum when it came to service. He asked us what we wanted to drink and eat, gave us our food and gave us our check. We never even got our water glasses refilled. But we watched as he served every single other table around us. He checked in with those tables multiple times. I really wanted to not leave a tip. I paid over $70 for a horrible restaurant experience."

The pastel blue toilets, the bartenders that have been there for 35 years, the junk filled walls, its all nice.  It feels distinctly Vegas.\n\nEhhh the food- good value, complete meal with wine, salad, entree and coffee- neat package.  Im just not one for uber cheesy suacey carby Italian.  Not my thing dont enjoy it."

Eggplant was extremely chewy and undercooked and it was covered it at least a pound of marinara sauce. You can't charge $26 for something that isn't perfection in Vegas! I've been to plenty of restaurants and paid $30 for one piece is salmon and it was the best salmon I've ever had in my life!! This place needs to be more about quality instead of quantity.  I've been to many Italians restaurants in different areas of the US and this was by far the worst! \n\nHate to say it but I would have enjoyed the food better at carraba's compared to this place. \n*note to the owner/cook- make sure the food is cooked before you serve it."

Once inside, it was pleasant to see that it literally has not changed ONE bit since I last ate there however many years prior. It's still extremely dark and the walls are covered with a plethora of random memorabilia. \n\nA polite older woman at the hostess station greeted us and we only had to wait five minutes or so before we were taken to our table. The waiter promptly came up to the table and took our drink order, and the drinks were out in a flash (along with the complimentary wine). \n\nThe next items that came out were a basket of garlic bread, an Italian Salad for myself and a minestrone soup for my date. We both LOVED the garlic bread...it was extremely soft and very tasty. The salad was pretty good and she loved the Minestrone.\n\nAs for our entrees, she ordered the Lasagna, and I had a New York Steak with a side of Ziti and Marinara sauce. She thoroughly enjoyed her dish, and I thought mine was decent. The steak was a little on the bland side, and the sauce that accompanied the pasta wasn't too great.\n\nThe desserts we had were excellent though. First, we had the cappuccino that comes as a part of the meal...and in addition, we had the cannolis. They were quite delicious, though not the best we've ever had.\n\nThis is a great place for a romantic evening, and it's not too terribly priced. You can expect to spend around $25-30 a person, but you have to figure in the unlimited wine as well as the salad/soup, garlic bread and cappuccino."

The prix fixe menu that includes highly drinkable red or white wine is great. If you want to see 70's celeb pics EVERYWHERE (99% of whom are deceased) and feel like it's the 70's again go check it out. A very professionally and well run spot. And fun. ***Great for large parties at the last minute!!*** as that's what we did and it was a blast."

We weren't hungry enough to eat two meals, so we wanted to share the chicken parm. We were told it was a $13 cover charge for the free wine- but we weren't drinking! We politely declined at the beginning of the meal (to which the waiter acted like we were aliens for saying we didnt drink) and still had to pay for it? Really dumb. Salad was just awful, bread sticks were really tasty though (the best part), and the pasta side dish was super bland. Chicken parm was good, but not $30 (plus $13 cover charge) good. Eat elsewhere."

We put this place on our itinerary because it was convenient, took reservations, and seemed like a really good deal. \n\nThe server was extremely nice and pretty attentive, especially for such a large group. The salad and garlic bread were both pretty good. I wish I had tried the minestrone soup, it looked yummy and my friend seemed to like it. Then my entree came and I was pretty disappointed. I chose the cannelloni with meat and definitely would have preferred something else. There was a weird cream sauce on half of it, luckily the other half had the normal red sauce. Still, the filling wasn't very good and I only ate a little bit of it, opting for more garlic bread to fill me up instead. \n\nSome of the girls did like their food. After trying some of their choices, it was better than mine, but I still wouldn't be likely to recommend Battista's based on the food. \n\nSo what about the all you can drink wine? Well...along with everything else, it was mediocre. If we had visited our first night rather than our last, maybe we would have been more into the wine. \n\nOverall, if you're not expecting much, go for it. It doesn't hurt to try once, especially if you're up for drinking a lot of average wine and eating unremarkable Italian food for not a bad price. But if I were you, I'd probably skip it. Sorry Battista's."

I'd rather purchase a good wine separately, but I suppose I can handle the complimentary bottomless bottle of house red or white that they offer you, though it tastes a bit watered down. The cappuccino was probably that to a kid, but to an adult it was nothing more than hot chocolate. Again though, it was \"free\" with my meal.  Meal prices ranged from $23 to $40. Sure, I'll go back again, but mainly for the romance."

Dark, romantic, little place with a ton of old school memorabilia. This is our second visit and I think we'll make it a staple for our Vegas trips.

We went this past Monday at 5:30 - not exactly what I would call a busy time. We had bread, salad, and food within 30 minutes, so we were feeling very rushed. I wasn't even halfway through my entree when the server was already coming by asking if we wanted cappuccino. The food was sub-par, nothing to write home about (the salad was DRENCHED in dressing and inedible). They gave us two carafes of wine - one white, one red. There were 5 of us, and we were never offered any more. From seating to signing the bill was exactly 1 hour. We asked our server Gerson for another carafe as we still had quite some time to kill before our show. His response was, \"I can absolutely give you more wine; however I need this table so you will need to drink this in the lounge.\" I have NEVER in my life been asked to get up from a table, ESPECIALLY after only one hour. We were absolutely appalled, and this will probably keep me from going there in the future."
