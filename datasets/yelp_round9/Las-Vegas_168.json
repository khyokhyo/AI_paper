            "review": "I only visited the Eiffel Tower Restaurant for some after dinner cocktails.  They make a Godiva chocolate martini that my mom and wife loved.  They have a handful of other house cocktails that are pretty good as well.  Not surprisingly the real value here is in the view.  The restaurant look straight across the street to the fountains of Bellagio which we enjoyed three or four times during our stay.  The menu is (surprise) traditional french and I am interested to come back for dinner and will update this review when that happens.\n\nFair warning, collared shirt or jacket required for guys."

            "review": "On our recent trip to Las Vegas, my wife, sister in law, and I had dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. Our server, Valentino, was superb. Valentino really made us feel comfortable and spoke as though he had known us his entire life, which was quite refreshing. His knowledge and professionalism really made the entire experience worth it. The entire staff was very attentive and friendly. Our drinks were constantly topped off and we never had to wait for anything.\n\nWe all had steak, which were by far the best steak I have had in a long time and the best, by far, in Las Vegas.\n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a high class, elegant meal and experience. Our reservations were on July 28 at 730pm, perfect to enjoy the sunset behind the Bellagio and enjoy the fountains after dark."

            "review": "We all went here to eat on our trip to Las Vegas. We decided to try this place, because we heard good things. I am going to start by saying that the food is amazing. Amazing is an understatement. I got a salad, but everyone's food was pretty delicious. The service was good. They had 3 waiters for our table so we had excellent service. The reason why I gave the restaurant a 3 star was because, they kept  bringing us mineral water, which we did not order and charged us for it. We spent almost $50 dollars for water we did not even order. If you are eating here, expect to spend some money!!! And, the wait time to get the food is also very long."

During our dinner we were able to watch the fountain show at the Bellagio.  \n\nThe service is first rate and the food amazing.  If you like souffle it's a must order for dessert.\n\nThe atmosphere is beautiful with low lights, table lines and elegant dinnerware.\n\nEverything we ordered was excellent."

            "review": "We didn't get to choose what we ordered since we did a group menu, but it was delicious nonetheless. We all had the filet mignon which was good, not great, but the appetizers were the ones that were super delicious. I love fois gras and their appetizer with jam was astounding. Super delicious. Somewhat built up by the waiters who said this was the best they've ever had (tough bill to live up to!) but it was super good nonetheless. I don't think waiters should necessarily say that, because anything other than best ever is disappointing. I'd love to try the other items by coming back. I also expected, for some reason, for this to be at the top of the eiffel tower but it's only a few floors up. Good view of the Bellagio fountain though!"

Upon exiting at the top of the Eiffel Tower, you're greeted by a woman and can see the bustling kitchen.\n\nI went to the bathroom as I waited for some of my party to arrive. Inside the bathroom, there's another lady who leads you to a stall. After you finish washing your hands, she gives you a pretty towel with the Eiffel Tower Restaurant Logo.\n\nAnyways, we get seated and a waiter begins to recommend dishes for you. You can feel the professionalism of the atmosphere and everything is in tip-top shape.\n\nWe Ordered:\n1. Duck Breast\n2. Beef Wellington\n3. Grilled Salmon\n4. Rabbit with a light Mustard sauce\n5. Beef Tenderloin\n6. Escargot\n7. Duck Liver\n8. Chocolate Souffle\n9. Strawberry Souffle\n\nThe appetizer that comes is a spinach soup I believe. Anyways, the presentation was amazing and they serve you bread. The outside view of the Bellagio fountains were amazing too."

However, I think the menu is a little pricey.\n\n* Saut\u00e9ed Loup de Mer, Barigoule, Braised Artichoke, Basil Pistou $54 (4 of 5) Tasty sea bass without bones. This was a tasty piece of white fish and I really enjoyed the braised artichoke.  \n* Saut\u00e9ed New York State Foie Gras, Slow Braised Pineapple, Alsace Spice Cake $28 (3.5 of 5) I really enjoyed the seared foie gras and braised pineapple, but I didn't think the spice cake complimenting the dish. I didn't think the texture of flavor complimented the dish. \n\nOverall, This place is beautiful and spectacular views, but to be price conscience, I will just go back for drinks and dessert."

            "review": "This was an AMAZING restaurant. If you are planning on eating dinner, I would suggest you make a reservation. When you make dinner reservations, you are seated by the window and are able to enjoy the water show at the Bellagio across the way. I was able to catch the show atleast 7 times before dinner was over. \n\nThis is a truely romantic spot. very cozy and dim. The food was beyond excellent. the steak and chicken both simply melt in your mouth.\n\nThe surf n' turf is a great dish. So beautifully put together and just the right amount of food. \nThe farm raised chicken is also just as delicious.\n\nEven though it is a bit pricey, it is deffinitely a great place to eat in Vegas. So if you are in Vegas for a special occasion, and you got some cash on you to spend, go to Paris, you wont regret it. \n\nxoxo"

We got a coveted window spot overlooking the fountains, our waiter Igor was very friendly and the food was great. In addition to that, compliments of the manager, we were served an appetizer and dessert to help celebrate our occasion. We had appetizers, entreees and dessert. Everything was what we expected and more. We will definitely keep returning everytime we are in Vegas."

I quickly corrected him and told him it was a bottle he kindly apologized and brought me the bottle. Except when the bill came BOTH were charged... I'm not one to complain so I just payed. But it upset me.. Other than that!! GREAT place to visit in Vegas. Great viewing area of the water show! Great for a nice date :)"

            "review": "This really has to be one of the best restaurants in Vegas not only for the food but also for the great view. I've had the pleasure of dining here twice. And because I had such a great experience the first time I recommended that we go back again for a great dining experience. Like in true Vegas fashion dinner was about 2hrs + long. This is not a bad thing I'm just not used to sitting for so long for dinner, being from NYC. \n\nI love french food, most people don't. I really don't know why. I ordered the filet mignon with Bearnaise sauce that was great, another dish ordered at my table was the vegetarian crepes and the salmon or artic char (can't remember). I have to say that we all enjoyed our meal, and if we were not rushing over to see Le Reve we probably would have sat a bit longer and ordered dessert. \nThe service here was top notch and the ambiance is great too. Its a bit of an older sophisticated crowd (40+) but that doesn't bother me because that usually means the food is great. The decor here is very art deco Paris posh, with the blush burgundy booths. This restaurant does remind me of the Jules Vernes Restaurant in the real ET(i think that's what its called) but this one has a more comfy yet elegant feel to the more sleek and modern look. \n\nIf you enjoy french food, a great view and the Bellagio water show this is the place to go. \n\nI l"

I had the New York streak cooked to perfection (Medium Well), and my GF had the roasted chicken which was also yummy, great thing about a relationship is sharing food. The sides were also good! It was a lil pricy, but worth the experience! They even offer to take your pic with a great background, and frame a 5x7 for $25. Glad my GF not only suggested it, but picked up the tab!

The view was spectacular and the restaurant is glamorous.  We had the best service.  We ordered the pairing, where we get different wines for each course.  But since we had a 4 hour drive, we opted for no wine.  The food was wonderful.   My appetizer was Warmed seasoned shrimp over a light sauce.  My boyfriend had the spinach and mushroom strudel.  He said it just melted in his mouth.  My shrimp was delicious.  His main course was a smoked salmon over egg omelet with crunchy potato strings and capers.     I had the marinated steak over potatoes with poached egg.  OMG  the flavors were fantastic.  We thought heaven had come to earth.   Our dessert was a souffl\u00e9 with grand marniere   along with a topping of strawberry ice cream with diced pistachios and fresh strawberries.  It all was great.  Please visit this wonderful place."

The kitchen view is what greets the guests once the elevator opens.  \n\nWe were led to the check in counter inside. We were 15 minutes early despite the traffic that day. We waited to be seated at the bar. We both ordered Nitron beer and watched the cool bar tenders mix drinks. \n\nAt exactly 4:45pm, the usher led us to the booth near the bar where our backs would be turned away from the Strip View which we requested upon making the reservation. We understood though that the area was still occupied by guests who were there earlier and haven't finished dining. The lady brought us to an elevated portion of the restaurant that was farthest from the window that they thought had a better view. The area felt like we're outcast so we looked around and checked out the available tables.  We chose the one almost at the center of the restaurant it was a great spot. We had plenty of room around us.\n\nOur waitress was excellent.  She had a great energy in serving and checking on us. We loved all the food except the fish dish. I wished we ordered two steaks instead for the main course. The first time I stood to use the restroom, a waiter escorted me. And when I came back, I got a new table napkin. They changed it like 3 times as many as my trips to the restroom.  It's the 2 bottles of beer and 2 glasses of water! \n\nWe took our time eating and enjoying the $480 dinner plus tip. Overall, the service was excellent and for a romantic evening like that, I would say it was worth it. \n\nWe took home with the table roses and souvenir photo."

            "review": "I took my husband and some of his family here for a reunion meal, and everyone loved the experience.  Laurent, the restaurant manager whom I contacted by email before our visit, ensured that we had a fabulous window table with an awesome view of the Bellagio Fountains.  Our wait staff gave us attentive, patient service.  And the chefs provided delicious meals.  My husband deemed his salmon with pinot noir sauce \"the best salmon ever.\"  I was a huge fan of the Grand Marnier souffle and the expensive ($18) specialty cocktails.  Our four guests ordered versions of the filet mignon, and all seemed pleased except for the one who ordered her filet medium well (it was more well done, and therefore tougher, than she had expected it to be).  All of the sides (potato gratin, green beans, brussels sprouts, and mushroom spaetzle) were tasty.  The Maine Lobster salad was very good, though it's worth noting that it contained far less kale than I had expected, just a little taste rather than salad-like greens.  The meal was, of course, seriously expensive ($717 for the six of us, including tax and the mandatory 18% gratuity (the gratuity was, I assume, mandatory because we were a larger group)).  We knew that going in (the menu, with prices, is available on the restaurant's website), however, so we were not unpleasantly surprised.  If you can afford to ignore the cost, eating at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant at Paris Las Vegas is a fun, tasty, memorable experience (the views truly are unforgettable)."

            "review": "I read plenty of reviews on here before finally deciding to book, I was also close to cancelling my reservation because of them but I'm glad I didn't. Leading up to the reservation they send you a text message asking you to confirm. When you do they will respond and ask you if you have any preferences, whether or not you'll be celebrating anything and would like to know if you want win/champagne or even a rose on your table which is nice. The view was great, we had a half circled table facing the water show at the Bellagio, The server (Rebecca) was awesome, really outgoing and over all made our dining experience even better since she was personable. The food was about the best french cuisine I've ever had, I ordered a New York steak, my wife got the filet mignon, Of course we got the veggies and potatoes etc but what really sealed the deal for us was the caramel souffle. They also have a photographer that will take a picture at your table or with a view of outside that charges $25 for the picture (price is tacked onto your bill) so you can expect to spend close to $300 or so with a few drinks, your meal and the picture not including the tip. Overall though you are paying for a really good meal and an experience which makes it all worthwhile."

            "review": "The spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains is the real selling point here ... honestly, I found the food good but not great and pretty overpriced.  Service, however, is excellent, and the general atmosphere is of a \"special\" event.\n\nI've been here before for Sunday brunch ... and if you time that right, you can see the fountains when they're running during the day on the weekends.  I really enjoyed that meal (about a year ago, I guess) and the prices weren't too outrageous.  They don't offer the souffl\u00e9 for dessert during the day, however, and since I REALLY wanted to try it based on the many rave reviews, we decided to come for dinner.\n\nWhen booking, I saw that if you book a 5:00 or 5:15 table, you are guaranteed a window table overlooking the fountains.  We had a show to get to anyway, so that sounded good to me.  However, our window table was off to one side, so the view of the fountains wasn't that great ... and one of us was pretty much pointed away from them entirely with no view at all to speak of.\n\nAppetizers -- corn chowder with lobster custard ($18) was way too sweet.  Had to add lots of salt to make it palatable.  Far better was the Roquefort souffl\u00e9 ($16), a small dome of light and fluffy blue cheese and eggs paired with a small green salad.  \n\nEntrees -- crispy-skinned arctic char with smoked beets ($46) was on the small side, but the fish filets were moist and tasty ... the plate also featured a foam emulsion that was surprisingly bland considering it was made with horseradish.  The beef wellington ($68 -- ouch) was a filet atop a layer of mushrooms and pate, all individually wrapped up in puff pastry.  A small pitcher of rich red wine reduction came alongside, as well as a pile of limp snow peas that looked like they'd been scooped out of a buffet chafing dish and plopped on the plate.  The meat was a shade overcooked, but still very tasty, especially with that sauce.  However, I could easily reproduce this meal at home for $10 with no advanced chef skills required. I find that annoying.  I don't mind paying high prices when magic is being done in the kitchen, magic I could never work myself.  This was not one of those meals.\n\nAnd so, time for the souffl\u00e9 (not sure of the price ... $18?).  We chose pistachio to share, and it was okay, but not over-the-moon fantastic.  It tasted very strongly of amaretto instead of pistachio.  If I had it to do over again, I'd go with the chocolate instead.\n\nEnd of the night, with drinks, tax, and tip, we spent about $235.  Meh.  I wouldn't do it again.\n\nI MIGHT, however, return for daytime brunch."

            "review": "After viewing those unbelievably talented Chefs on The Iron Chef shows, I had a craving for the best French food while staying at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.  I walked around for half an hour, and was totally frustrated (and hungry at 10PM after a long flight) that I could not find a real French restaurant by walking around the Paris casino lobby.  Finally, the concierge walked me to the Eiffel Tower, \"that's where you find real French food.\"  Oui!  An older middle-aged lady, very well-dressed and hmmm.... well-proportioned ...  took me to the elevator behind her.  In a few seconds through layers of steel super structures, I arrived at the restaurant.  \n\nScene 1:  First Impression.  Elevator opens to the kitchen with displays of dishes, stainless steel wares, and busboys. If my synapses were not all firing tonight, I would have thought I'd entered the restaurant through the kitchen from the alley.  1 out of 5 stars.   \n\nScene 2:  Chit Chat.  The greeter took me to the Hostess kiosk where I had to wait for the boy/girl chit chatting before they would address me.  1/5.\n\nScene 3:  They asked for my reservation name.  The restaurant was half full (empty?) so I said I did not have one.  She said \"Let me find a table for you.\"  Within minutes, they found a table for me -- on the inside wall where the view was to another table.  Wait, what's wrong with any of the tables overlooking the Bellagio water fountain dancing thing?  They were all sitting empty.... vacant... unoccupied..  \"Well, Sir, we are trying to shut down that portion of the restaurant this time of the night, but let me check.\"  As if he was a Secret Service agent, he touched his ear and talk into his wrist and then asked me to return to the lobby while they set up my new table!  Now we talking.  3 out of 5. \n\nScene 4:  The Tea.  \"Shall we start you with some wine perhaps?\"  \"No, thank you.  I will have green tea please.\"  \"Am sorry, we have no green tea.  But we have black and peach tea.  Very nice.\"  Am easy to please, so I agreed to the peach tea.  What came out?  Ice tea!  Am easy to please, so I kept the ice tea, unsweetened out of a very nice bottle.  \"Can I also get a cup of hot tea, please.\"  \"Am sorry Sir, we don't have hot tea.\"  Really? The French don't drink tea?  How do you all get sober after being drunk from all that wine?  What am I going to wash down my fine dining with?  I can't really ask for a Coke Zero.  If the French don't drink hot tea, am certain they won't drink Coke Zero.  She gave an uncomfortable smile as I gave her an awkward frown on the tea thing.  \"Perhaps you would like coffee instead.\"  I told her I'm mormon.  That stopped further suggestions.  I was thinking of Dave (mormon friend) when I said that.  I was satisfied that my response immediately wiped away her smile.  1/5.\n\nScene 5:  The Appetizer.  The fun begins here.  Food tastes great at a great restaurant.  Food would probably taste heavenly if you are hungry, at the \"finest French restaurant in Vegas,\" in the  Paris hotel perched high in the Eiffel tower.  I escargot.  \"But I want you to know, it only comes with 5 escargots.\"  What on my forehead said I wanted a pound of escargots saut\u00e9ed and served on a hot dog bun?  I smiled and politely said that was a great portion.  A few minutes later... \"Am sorry Sir.  The chef said we are out of escargot for tonight.\"  But it's a French restaurant!  It's like McD is out of french fries.  Fine.  What else ya got?  After some prodding to try cold smoked salmon, I settled on \"giant scallops on a bed of ox tail.\"  After a weekend of pho at home, I am up to my eye browse with ox tails, but the scallops was appealing because it was light.  I want to be French tonight.  Light portions.  Great presentation.  Explosive tastes.  The scallop (one) wasn't giant. but it was good.  The oxtail was horrendous, however.  You know the levels of saltiness.  At the bottom it is bland, then a hint of salt, then \"to taste\", then salty, then really salty, then bitter.  Mine was bitter.  2 out of 5.  \n\nScene 6:  The Bread.  Before the appetizer came out, the bread man came along.  It was a nice silver tray with different breads laid out in rows to categorize the different breads.  He took 2 spoons and created a make-shift tong to handle the bread. French-like.  I chose the sesame seed bread.  Then he said \"you get to choose two.\"  Oh my gosh!  For a $100 meal I get to choose 2.  What if I wanted 3?  1 star.  \n\nScene 7:  Duck.  Perfectly cooked.  Red.  Moist.  Skin wasn't crunchy as I preferred.  They served the duck on a bed of what tasted like salty and smooshy fruit cake.  Did not complement well at all.  I had to cut the muscle and skin from the breast.  The reduction encircling the duck was again salty. 2/5.\n\nScene 8:  Desert.  The banana souffle was the highlight.  I had to order it first so the chef can start it right away.  Fluffy, light, airy.  Exactly how it should be.  5/5.\n\nNot worth it.  View was nice, though."

            "review": "One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. My wife and I were in Vegas to celebrate our 10-year anniversary. I wanted a memorable dining experience and settled on the Eiffel Tower Restaurant for our celebratory dinner on 1-30-16.\n\nWhen I made reservations, I asked if we could get a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. As some other reviewers have mentioned, I too was told that the only way to guarantee a window table was to buy an all-inclusive package.\n\nThis is my only nit-pick with the Eiffel Tower Restaurant....the price of the package is insane. Even if it is \"all-inclusive,\" there's just no way that two people will eat/drink enough to justify the price you commit to in order to guarantee a window seat. To put it in perspective, my wife and I ended up getting a 6-course chef's tasting menu, we each had 3 premium wines/drinks, we got a commemorative photo, I had roses delivered to the table, and we got 2 Express tickets to the top of the tower after dinner. Even with all of that, it still didn't add up to the price needed to \"guarantee\" a window.\n\nThe good news.....we ended up getting a nice window table anyway. I declined the guarantee price but simply asked if they could do their best. And they came through.\n\nWhen you take the elevator up, you exit right into the kitchen, which I thought was a cool touch. It's like you immediately enter a different world, where you get to see world-class chefs at work.\n\nThe view from the restaurant is amazing. As mentioned, our table was right up against the window looking directly over the fountains.\n\nAt the server's suggestion, we opted for the 6-course tasting menu. It was great because we got a taste of everything. The highlights were a warm lobster salad, wild snapper, and venison. The only thing I wished we hadn't done was the cheese tray. It was an optional add-on and, in fairness, our server warned us that it's not popular. I ordered it anyway, and I shouldn't have because it just wasn't our thing.\n\nThe service was top notch. Literally the best service I've ever had in a restaurant. Very attentive without being intrusive. I wish I could remember our server's name to give him a shout out because he did a fantastic job.\n\nDon't go here if you're on a budget. If you want a memorable, romantic experience in Vegas, though, this is your place."

I have been coming to vegas for years but always ate at buffets or just fast food. Being it was my 30th birthday me and my boyfriend wanted something romantic. \n\nWe called the restaurant to make a reservation for the next day. They were very polite over the phone. The next day we were running late for dinner so we called to let them know. When we got to the elevator we were greeted then getting off the elevator a girl walked us over to check in. The lady who checked us in was very nice and told me happy birthday. We were seated at the window with a view of the cosmo hotel and the water show. It was beautiful.\n\nOur waiter came over and gave us the menu and asked if we wanted water. We also ordered a glass of wine. When we were waiting for our food they brought us bread and butter and something that was white I think he said cauliflower something lol. It was amazing. For our appetizer we got the pork belly. OMG it was so amazing! Then we got our food. I ordered the roasted farm raised chicken and my boyfriend ordered the beef wellington. They were perfect portions for us and so amazing. The staff was very very attentive without being too much. They kept filling my water which was nice being I was a little hungover from the night before. At the end of the night they gave me a chocolate mouse that had happy birthday written on the plate. Everything from the staff, the views and the food was perfect. I'm so beyond happy with my experience there and will definitely be coming back for another occasion. Our bill was $195 and worth every penny. Thank you for making my birthday perfect!"

            "review": "When dining on the strip, your options are limited to, buffets, celebrity chef restaurants and large tourist traps that are ridiculously overpriced and well.... just shitty.  I honestly expected the same of Eiffel Tower after my last stint here in Vegas at Le Cirque.  I HATED that restaurant.  Ugh... The food was astonishingly bad and the service well... Let me put it this way, I was about to get all Mayweather on it's ass.\n\nAnyway... Moving on...\n\nThe name alone screams TOURIST TRAP  but don't let that fool you.  Once you hit the elevator on the first floor, you're greeted by a young lady whom then leads you to the restaurant floor where the doors open to an impressive open kitchen.   Once you step out, you are greeted with cheerful faces that lead you to a window table, overlooking the water shows of Bellagio.  For a minute, you might forget how cheesy this all is and actually enjoy all the twinkling lights of this faux city.\n\nStarting from the amuse bouche to the entree, I loved every morsel.   I'd highly suggest sticking with the NY Strip.  It was just divine.  This steak was my 2nd favorite of all time, after Mastro's BH.  Perfectly charred and beautifully bloody.  Just the way I like it.  Don't bother with sauces.  This beauty doesn't have anything to hide.  Also a must is the Blue Cheese Souffle.  TRUST ME, you'll want to lick the plate.\n\nWhat really surprised me was the service.  In Vegas, you don't expect this kind of 5 star treatment.  Most places here treat you like cattle, even the $$$$ restaurants.  They don't give 2 shits about you because they've got a hundred other diners to take your place, but not here.  Our waiter would magically appear whenever we needed anything but was never intrusive.  The staff truly seems to appreciate their jobs.  It was never \"stuffy\".  From the front desk, to the bussers, to your waiter, they all serve you with a smile.  A very comfortable, beautiful setting with a sincere appreciation for fine dining.\n\nI go to Vegas about twice a year on business and Eiffel Tower will surely be where you find me on every trip."

There's not much of a weekday lunch crowd and getting a nice table with a view of the strip, Bellagio, and Caesars' Palace was easy.  I had a nice $16 burger that was cooked medium rare as requested.  Wife had baked vegetable crepes for $17.  Food was ok, but you're really paying for the view.   They also served complimentary bread puffs and a nice pistachio pudding.   Having recently gone to the Hancock's 95th floor Signature Room, I thought we might be going to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but this place is like at the 5th floor elevation.  Makes sense - they wouldn't have a whole lot of tables at the top of that skinny tower!"

It just makes the dinner that much more special.\n\nWe did the tasting menu with the wine pairing. If you are going to go here I would recommend to go big or go home. I never really thought wine pairings were worth the extra price but I was proven how wrong I was in this case. The flavor combinations were divine. The type of food you eat slow and quietly to savor every taste. \n\nWe were worried that the tasting menu would not fill us up by the time we were done but I was well stuffed by dessert. The service was just what it should be, attentive polite upscale but not annoying. Go ahead and read the tasting menu on their website - the first dish was my favorite. Lobster salad paired with champagne - what an amazing combination this was..\n\nMake sure you are dressed propoerly. They made my Dad change his pants because he was wearing shorts. I can understand why they would do that though.\n\nI ate at many expensive places in Vegas. Food is always amazing but this place is simply an experience you don't forget - very special."

The only obvious reason for people to book a dinner here is to watch the fountains across the street at Bellagio.  Seriously, the folks at Bellagio should charge some kind of royalty for the amount of business that the view generates.  Our waiter was in on the scam - he admitted that he wouldn't eat some of the items on the menu when we sent back the escargot app that one of us ordered.  My food ranged from poor to solidly average.  The atmosphere, despite the view, was so bustling that it was unplesant: waiters rushing all over and a too-warm temperature.  Certainly not what I would expect in a fine-dining restaurant.  The biggest insult was on the wine list where bottles ranged from 3-4 times the retail price.  When we left, we couldn't help feeling ripped off."

            "review": "I had one of the best meals of my life here!\n\nThe Eiffel Tower Restaurant is a treat!  AS others have said there is a worry that this restaurant would be all about flash with no substance.\n\nIt does have flash but it also has plenty of substance to offer.  While this is not perfect it is very, very good.  The service was impeccable from start to finish with the waiter and sommelier working very hard to get us exactly the meal we were looking for.  The restaurant is designed so the spectacular view is forefront and everything else compliments that.  It is slightly noisy but not overly loud.  This place has a happy energetic hum to it.  \n\nMany couples were seated directly facing the view away from the noise so I would still recommend this place for a top notch romantic atmosphere.\n\nWe were here from out of town to celebrate an event and made the lucky choice of dining here.\n\nWe came in just as the sun was setting and watched the strip transform around us, it was breathtaking.  But this place is about more than just a sensational view.\n\nThe restaurant opened with a free amuse bouches one which paired three flavors a salmon mousse, asparagus with a lemon foam and a bit of pastry and a wonderful lobster preparation, we argued over which was the best.\n\nWe started with caviar, a blue cheese souffle pudding with salad, the fricasse of escargot, sweetbreads and fennel and finally the foie gras with pears.\n\nThe caviar was served beautifully on square platforms with indentations for the caviar, creme fraiche and chives.  It was served with a metal spoon rather than a mother of pearl but that was the only flaw.  The caviar was wonderful tasting and all the various accompaniments flawless (there were both buckwheat and plain blini AND toast points).\n\nThe foie gras was seared perfectly and came to the table at just the right temperature.  The accompanying pears in a sauternes sauce did not seem quite right as it needed more sweetness to contrast with the foie gras.\n\nThe fricasse was not as remarkable as I hope but it was a nicely balanced dish with a great contrast of textures and flavors, it seemed on the mild side for such an ambitious combination of elements but still very nicely done.\n\nThe blue cheese souffle pudding was incredible.  It was a sturdy souffle which did not fall when cut into but such a wonderful, flavor and it worked so well with the dressing on the greens.  Just wonderful, absolutely the high point of our starters.\n\nI had the Beef Wellington which was perfectly tender and seasoned perfectly.  Done just on the rare side of medium, it was heavenly. \n\nOur table generally loved the potato croquettes but I was somewhat underwhelmed by them.  They seemed too simple and by the time I was passed them too cool and limp.\n\nFinally the desserts, there were many ordered and consumed at our table.  I remember the Pistachio souffle as being dreamlike in its perfection of flavor and form, the other souffles were magnificent in their execution as well but the pistachio flavor just was so intriguing and well done.  The Napoleon was lovely and just as delicate as one could wish and there was a wonderful chocolate plate that I was too full to touch but looked perfect.\n\nDespite the magnificence of the meal, I have a few concerns about this place.  It is on the pricey side for what you get.  I almost took off a star for the very few missteps during the meal, however the overall experience was so wonderful and the great times I have had stopping by for a drink and an appetizer on past trips to Las Vegas are also terrific, I have to give this my highest rating."

Yeah, we spent more than we planned for lunch thanks to a pricey but tasty cocktail and wine menu, but we also got more thanks to nice views, formal service and above-average fare.\n\nThis place was loaded with French tourists when we were there, which is something that's both heartening and depressing. On the one hand it shows that the food must be reasonably good and authentic, but on the other it makes you wonder if the French are the least adventurous diners in the world. You fly thousands of miles for vacation to sit in a replica of a famous landmark from your home country and eat food you could get on any city block in France? Bold move, Jacques! As Midwesterners, however, we thoroughly enjoyed the upscale French bistro food and relaxing setting for lunch. Seafood options were particularly good, as were the baked goods."

When I questioned the charge I was told by David, the manager, the cutting fee was explained to my wife when she made the reservation (first lie) and then was explained a second time when we checked in (second lie).

We were treated to a delicious little creamy corn soup amuse-bouche - ooh lala!  The wine was very good and a nice selection of by-the-glass choices.  We both had the petite filet, and both were excellent.  And we ordered the souffle, which was mouth-watering and timed perfectly to the end of the meal.  The only hiccup was a rather difficult-to-deal-with ceasar salad that we split.  The dressing was okay, but quite oily, and since the romaine was served in the \"traditional\" un-chopped style, it ended up just being a pain.  But overall we were really pleased with the meal and felt it was worth the (very large) bill."

We walked out of the elevator and the kitchen was right there. You could see all the hustlin and bustlin of the background scene. Totally different from what I expected but kinda cool at the same time. We got seated in a booth towards the back of the round restaurant but we still got this gorgeous view of the water front of Bellagio and the strip. The tables closest to the windowline were all two-seaters so no go for us. \n\nThe atmosphere is great but the food is only so-so. We had the pinky toe crab salad and seared scallop for appetizer. It was refreshing but nothing too special. My sea bass was significant overcooked...it was like chewing overcooked chicken. Since we were on a time schedule, I didn't bother to send my dish back. My friends' dishes weren't too impressive either, with the exception of the rack of lamb. The most memorable dish of the night was the souffle, which you should order at the beginning of your meal. It takes 40 minutes to make and they only make 20 for the entire room at a time. We had the Grand Manier and Caramel....omg....absolutely heavenly. I could eat that all night long. We also had the Banana Towel thingy (forgot what it was called) It wasn't too special either. I thought it would come warm but it was icy cold. It was just stacked banana slices swimming in white chocolate sauce. Again, nothing too special. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the meal because of the company and the view. I'm not too thrill about the food since I had much better in SF."

When you're walking to the restaurant you have to walk through the kitchen, you got to see the chefs at work and it smelled amazing in there. \n\nMy friend and I both got the French onion soup which isn't like the  typical kind you get at other places, it was very creamy and flavorful. They also give you an amuse bouche and delicious house bread with butter. By the time my entree came, I was already full. We also both got the classic eiffle tower burger and pretty sure that was the best burger I have had in a long time. The beef patty was pretty big and very well seasoned. Every bite I took melted in my mouth. The most moist burger I have ever had!!  I also mentioned to the hostess it was my friends birthday and they surprised her with a cute dessert!!  I highly recommend coming here for either a nice romantic dinner or just a fun brunch!"

The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the view is spectacular! I sat at a window table overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the rest of the strip and it was absolutely gorgeous. The service could not be beat. The food was also excellent. I ordered the Chicken with aged Parmesan and it was phenomenal. The sides it came with were cooked in a traditional French style which I loved! The environment is very relaxed and tranquil which is a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the strip. This is an excellent place if you're looking for a fancy meal or a special event. The staff is very welcoming and attentive and make you feel like they're catering to you. You definitely get more than your money's worth."

A good vantage point of Vegas and if you're in the right spot you get a marvelous view of the Bellagio fountains.  However, unless only 2 people are dining, the vantage point is mediocre for the fountains.\n\nDinner was delicious.  We only ordered entrees as we had to run to a show.\n\nBeef Wellington:  Takes approximately 30 minutes but was worth it.  Very delicious at medium rare but make sure to ask for the sauce on the side as it can be a bit overwhelming.  \n\nRoasted Chicken was delish.  It's a large portion and the veggies were cooked just right.\n\nSalmon and the duck were also very good.\n\nSides:  \nClassic Au Gratin was dry. \nCreamed corn was not good.  It was like a creamy polenta and I hate polenta.  Blah!!\nCreamed spinach and mushrooms were a hit for the entire table!!\n\nThe downer for this restaurant is the service.  Most of the wait staff looks confused and or rushed.  A large table next to us definitely wanted to have a good time and celebrate however, the waiter was clueless.  Our waitress was not friendly and was very curt and short with us.  A real shame for such a beautiful restaurant with good food.\n\nI have to say that I truly enjoyed the food here however, based upon the experience with the waitstaff, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant will not be at the top of my list for a nice dinner out.  There are too many other options in Vegas that have great food and great service."

We waited for 15min and then told her we had to go since we had a shoe at 9:00pm. She didn't even try to get a table and not even a word of sorry and she bluntly asked if she can cancel our reservation.

We still had somewhat of a view but only when the waiter had moved out of the way and when the other tables in front of us shifted their heads to the side. You would think that at a fine dining restaurant,  plate settings and napkins would already be there at table prior to our seating. We had a party of 3 and were missing 2 napkins. And they use fake battery operated candles.lame. For the amount of staffing they had,  service was slow. We didn't get any hello or welcome. No such acknowledgement. I don't know if it was because we were the only Asian clients there at the time or if we weren't dressed up enough to be treated as clients. \nThe scallops and escargot for appetizers was good.  Beef wellington was recommended and it was OK. The steak in it was cooked to perfection but the pastry puff on the outside was a bit too thick and slightly soggy. Our server didn't come back until the end to check up on us. By then, I just wanted to get out of there. My stomach was knotting up. My husband and best friend had stomach issues that whole night too. We had to end our night short due to whatever we had consumed there. What a waste of a night in Vegas. \nThe whole experience was no fine dining. Service wasn't great. Food was just OK until we got sick from it. Never coming back."

I feel that this is a great restaurant for people who are visiting Vegas, because the restaurant offers a great view of the strip, as well as, the Bellagio fountain show.

But I like it more when they take their time with you and agreeing with what you order. I felt that she was pushy to get my dad to get a side dish even though it was obvious that he didn't want any. Then when my mom was next to order and she asked my dad if he got any side dishes, the waitress gave an attitude, \"I already asked him, but he didn't want any.\" When we were undecided on whether we should get one or two seafood platter, she announced over the entire table to get everyone's attention to hurriedly decide what we want. \nLastly, we opt to skip the dessert and just asked for the check and she gave a disapproving look. The restaurant was bit pricey for the food and service, but I guess you're paying for the spectacular view."

Overall worked out to about $125+ per person. Somewhat pricey, but for the great Bellagio Fountain views, excellent service, creative and tasty dishes, and reasonably sized portions...it's definitely worth it for the special occasion.\nTasting menu had:\n- Crab corn chowder - Pretty good, Nice presentation\n- Mediterranean Sea Bass over Quinoa - Very tasty, very inventive quinoa prep with chicken stock, champagne butter reduction and crispy shallots.\n- Veal with mushrooms - Only OK\n- Choice of dessert, upgrade charge for souffle - definitely worth the upgrade.\nFor best views and ambiance (for couples, anyway), get the table right by the windows, and get there by 6:30pm (during summer) to get the full range of time-of-day views...sunset through night time...it's breathtaking.\nDefinitely coming back."

This was an exercise in how can we make the most money serving the least quantity and quality food to an unsuspecting crowd.  There were only two choices for an appetizer:  one soup or one salad.  My salad might has well have been dumped straight out of a bag from the local supermarket.  The turkey was so, so with a tiny amount of boring gravy.  The pecan pie was good.  I had been a huge fan of this restaurant and all the prior visits were worthy of 5++ stars.  The whole family was looking forward to this wonderful experience together enjoying excellent food, great service and unbelievable views.  What we got was one of the most boring Thanksgiving meals ever, great service and unbelievable views.  Prices were astronomical, but we were expecting that.  But wait it gets better, then they had the audacity to charge $6 extra for the souffl\u00e9 after charging $79 for the meal.  Unreal!!!  The souffl\u00e9 was ok at best (no one finished theirs at our table which had never happened before).  We were all so let down and we will never visit for Thanksgiving again. This is what a restaurant does just before it dies.  Don't bother.  I should have known when I booked reservations the day before Thanksgiving with no problem that something was wrong!!!  I chalked it up to the horrible economy, not so Vegas was packed yesterday.  Oh well live and learn."

One pet peeve of the room is the huge column that divides the space, which can create awkward ducking or hitting your head. The private room does not have a great view of the Bellagio fountains, but does have a nice view overall. \n\nThere is a minimum you need to spend to reserve the room, not sure of the price, but price per person (sans vin) came to about $100 each, not including tax, tip and all those other extras that can get tacked on. \n\nThe prix fixe meal started with:\n\n* Blue Cheese Souffl\u00e9 Pudding w/ Walnut, Pecan, Petite Salade - Interesting. Kind of like Boursin meets Jello. About the size of a small ramekin, it went well with a baguette. Great salad! \n\n* Tuscan Kale Salad w/ Door County Dried Cherries, Quinoa Croutons, Toasted Pecans - Okay, so technically one could call this gluten free! And the kale salad was a nice counterbalance to provide all the antioxidants one needs when in Vegas. Why do we have to know the cherries are from Door County? I don't know. Where is Door County? Again, I don't know. Very fresh salad, the tang of the cherries provided just the right \"bite.\"\n\n* Saut\u00e9ed Wild Salmon w/ Quinoa Summer Beans, Tomato, First Pressed Olive Oil - This is what I'm talkin' bout! Perfectly done, beautifully prepared salmon that melted in your mouth. Wild salmon can sometimes have a more \"meatier\" taste that farm-raised due to the lower fat content, but this was spectacular.\n\n* Eiffel Tower Classic Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - La pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance! Very large serving for a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e - could be easily shared, in my opinion. No one could finish theirs.

So to break out of the 3 or 4 star range they have to do something to knock my socks off. Everything was very competently done. Flavors excellent. Service impeccable. The deal clincher was the venison. When I hear venison, my mind goes immediately to a poor gamey tasting deer that was shot and driven around on some rednecks hood for a day. I would never ever ever order venison. The meat course was venison. I was worried. When it arrived, it was the most amazing piece of venison  (maybe any kind of meat) I have ever tasted. I'll ding them just a bit for the short pour of the Anderson Valley Cabernet that came with. So 4.9 on my scale. For here I'll give them a 5 because I can't give them 4.9 and 4.9 is closer to 5 than 4. Remember this is Las Vegas...."

I specifically told the waitress my husband did not like fish especially anchovies but, reassured me the Caesar salad was very mild with hints of anchovies (We are both well aware there are trace amounts in the dressing already). When the salad arrived, it have several large pieces of anchovies on top. We had to flag down our waitress and get a basic salad replacement. I choose the fish which was underwhelming but, I was hungry. We had to search for our waitress several times (asking other servers and bussers) to get simple things like refills and more bread. The chocolate souffle tasted like non sweetened cocoa fluffy cardboard. To top it all off, there was a crying baby near us the entire time and a gentleman on his phone next to us. On our way out, we saw several kitchen staff just standing around staring at people entering and exiting the elevator; no \"hello\", \"goodbye\" or \"thank you\".

Good foods, great views, and service was decent.  Most of us ordered fish and various sides or salads.\n\nAlthough I had an odd comment.  One of my guest mentioned he liked the steak at Salt Grass better... really?!?"

When our name was called we were invited to the bar which I think a highway robbery, cocktail menu is in the top $. \nbut hubby was in the mood and ordered a single malt whiskey 18, I don't drink so was given water.\nWe snagged a nice seat in the middle 3rd level area and had a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. To add to the ambiance, a French accented server took our order. \n\nI wanted to order the pork chop but was warned that it is salty *thanks I hate salty food,  so I opted for the rack of lamb 59  (comes in 3 pcs 20 per piece of meat chops WHOA !). For my taste, the tomato and lamb was not a good pairing. I tasted rack of lamb at my local bistro,  w some pear chutney and that was unforgettable. I requested a side of mint jelly to compliment the lamb. That was delish w the jelly. Also ordered a bottle of sparkling water Badoit. \n\nHubby had the 22 oz ribeye w a bone marrow 89 ordered side of potato gratin 10 and mushroom 15. He was in cow heaven! Paired w cabernet sauvignon.\nFrench accented guy recommended to throw in the Seafood platter to the order 69 per person (one order to share). Are you kidding me? it would be gluttony. We sort of agreed at first, then requested to please take it off the seafood platter from the order. I regretted ordering the sides too. With the price of the proteins, all sides MUST come as gratis. But oh well this is Eiffel Tower of LV,\n\nWe did not have room for dessert so we said no to the litany of dessert list, but the French accented guy was kind enough to give one small shot of complimentary small chocolate mousse to share.\n\nOverall view is nice, service is attentive yet a bit pushy in the ordering process, The more they throw in the table, the bigger the tip.The guy who offers bread is very friendly, \n\nThe bill came to $200+. Will I come back? Maybe not, it was a bit stressful dining here. I truly miss my neck of the woods fine dining."

The Duck was the best of the bunch, but still not what you would expect from a restaurant like this. The dessert was the worst Creme Brulee I've probably had anywhere. \n\nThis place is cute for having a few cocktails, but if you're looking for a great dinner spot, head down stairs to Mon Ami Gabi."

They asked if it was a special occasion. Very superb hostess. We came in the next night at 9 pm. Crowded, but got seated immediately in a corner table up front.our waiter , Mario was excellent. Best service and food ever. The bride had the NY steak and I had the fish that Chef makes in the video online. Best dinner ever. At any restaurant at any time ever. Kudos for Mario for keeping the table next to us in check. The woman odering wine got out of control taking 20 minutes to order. Thanks for the memorable night."

Yuri, my server was very hospitable. \n\nFood was great. Again I did the tasting menu. My favorites were the sea bass and the souffle. Damn, they make the best souffles. I would come back and just hang out at the bar and just eat souffle if I could.\n\nI also like their communication too. They would text me updates and offer me window seating at an earlier time. And with the window seating, it's a big plus when you dine here.\n\nI recommend signing up for \"Lettuce Eats.\" You get points and earn $10 for every $140 you spend. There are a lot of restaurants under Lettuce Eats so you can earn points by not just eating at the Eiffel Tower.\n\nNote to David G (dgazzano@leye.com). Hey, if you're going tell people to email you directly for upcoming service, the least you can do is actually email people back. I pretty much did everything via Open Table without your help. Thanks bud!"

And mentioned to them that i would like to have a window table to see the fountains. i was asked if i celebrated any occasion. Thank god i did not because the experience was ruined! we arrived 20 min earlier just to give them some time. when we walked in was very crowded and no place to stand.  At 8.45pm we were approached by the hostess that took us to the very last table in the corner that oversees Paris hotel valet, you cannot even see the strip,  and i requested a window table by the bellagio fountains i told them this numerous time, on the phone and when we arrived, I was totally ignored! They make me so mad by their attitude that i told them i am local i can come back here anytime, i did not come here just to taste their food i came here for full experience. The hostess advised me that we will have to wait for a requested table a little bid more. Few min later she comes back and bring a blazer for my husband saying that you cannot wear  sweater you must wear suit and a collar shirt, REALLY? why did not you mentioned this on the phone about the dress code, and why other guys where dressed differently and they were not given the blazer? and common  its not a five star restaurant!!!! after such a rude approach, we lost appetite, i told them that i would like to leave all of a sudden at 9.15 they found a table for us, one hour after we came there, now what is the point of taking a reservation? I took a deep breath i did  not want to be scandalous never done this before but my patience was at zero. \nafter we made an order, the waiter was very pleasant, but his assistant was terrible, i asked for bottle of sparkling water, after we had a half full glass of water, he comes back and with out asking pours TAP WATER into our glasses!!!! seriously??????\nafter we told him we were drinking a bottle of sparkling water, he said no problem i will bring you another one, at the end they charge us for 2 bottle of waters!\nTHE ICING ON THE CAKE WAS AT THE END! When i orders raspberry napoleon, and what did i pulled out from my mouth after taking a bide? yes! HAIR!!!!!!!!!\ni think enough said."

Here is a quick recap of my visit.\n\n-Reservations were easy to get in, even on a weekend. I think it might be because the restaurant requires a $50 non refundable deposit to reserve. You cancel on them, they get $50 for the cancellation.\n\n-The view was fantastic, however the seating arrangements are definitely not. It looks like the restaurant jam packs everyone against the windows if you request a window seat. You also will get half a table which means you will feel like you are truly sharing a table for dinner. This place is tiny.\n\nService was a solid good. The hostess by the elevator was fantastic and very upbeat. Sever was nice and always made sure we had enough bread and water.\n\n\nFood was about a 5/10. To sum it up, it honestly tastes like reheated frozen dinners. Ordered beef short ribs, free range chicken, and gratin. I got 4 tiny ones that weren't not even warm. The food was cold and tasted like it had been resting on a warmer for some time. I truly think the food is pre-made and not to order. Selection is truly limited. You have a menu with only two sides, no pages. Appetizers on the left, entrees and sides on the right. Food is way over priced as well. $90 for a 22oz bone in rib eye. Not even including a side as they are all a la carte.\n\nOverall skip this place. Not worth the money and the food isn't very good. If you want a scenic view, invest in a city view room at your hotel, or pay a few bucks and get the Eiffel Tower experience. Also this restaurant does not appear to care too much about feedback because it only cares to respond to those who enjoyed their visit. Make note...."

Have always had a great view in the past, but this time we got stuck at the worst table in the restaurant overlooking the pool at Paris.  I should have questioned the hostess and asked to wait for another one.  While our service was very friendly and we did order appetizers and dessert, it took a long time for our waiter to get our wine going and we did not get the check until 10:30 (we had a 7:30 reservation).

The bread is to die for and consistent with authentic French bread straight from the oven, and the beef Wellington was so tender I cut it with a fork! The putter pastry was flakey and light with the right balance of crunch on the crust and soft fluffy pastry near the meat center. I am picky on steaks and do not like when they are over cooked, and this was spot on perfect as far as how it was cooked. My only reason for not rating this a five is the wait even with reservations- when there were empty tables comparable to ours. It seemed odd that several couples and groups were left to wait even though there was clearly seating available."

We sat in the bar area where it's first come, first serve seating. There are 4 seats in this area that have amazing views of the Bellagio water show. There weren't a lot of people at the bar on a Tuesday night, so we got this prime seating pretty easily. If you want a panoramic view and don't mind a pricey dinner, make a reservation in the corner window spots. We got the chocolate souffl\u00e9, which took about 25 minutes to make, but was delicious and worth the wait!

We started with escargot and a kale salad that literally made our taste buds jump out of our mouths.  I had the Beef Wellington.  At the first bite, I swear I saw the sky open up and trumpets sound.  Absolutely the best meal I have ever had.  The puff pastry surrounding the filet was delicate and the mignon was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  My partner had rabbit and it too was truly a gastronomic gift from God.  \n\nOur server was terrific and suggested the pistachio souffl\u00e9 to end our dining experience and I am so glad she did.  It was delicious.   \n\nWe sat by the window, just one table from the corner and had an excellent view of the strip and the Bellagio light/water show.  The meal, paired with some excellent wine, was one that I will not forget.   I can't wait to go back.\n\nMy only constructive criticism would be to tell the staff, except the initial server, to stop coming to the table so often.  I love to enjoy good food AND good conversation and I like to take my time with a good meal.  We were disrupted, too many times for my taste, by wait staff asking if they could clear our plates.  I don't enjoy it when plates are taken from the table before everyone is finished.  Just my own pet peeve and it did not mar the evenings culinary experience.  WHAT A MEAL!!"

They could have left it sitting in some of it's juices for 56 dollars.\n\nFor the amount I paid for the fillet, chicken, and side of potatoes ($128 including tip), I expected better service from my waiter. His description of the fillet when I asked about how it comes, \"It's literally a piece of meat on a plate\", didn't sound very appetizing. When he asked if I wanted a side of potatoes, he never even told me how they would come. (They ended up being potatoes au gratin) Again, the fillet was burnt on the outside which didn't make me too happy.\n\nFor that kind of money, I want excellent service."

I wore a very fancy dress and he wore a suit. We blended it quite well with everyone. \nMy boyfriend planned all of this ahead of time, which I would suggest to do, because to reserve a window table (which we did) it was $100. The view was beautiful. The fountains went off every 30min. Before our appetizer they gave us a sample of the soup of the day, it was celery something... It was so yummy! We ordered the escargot (I was expecting garlic and butter, but the escargot has more of a cream flavor, different but still good). \nIn between our app and our meal at 5pm (when the fountains were going off) my boyfriend became my fianc\u00e9. Yes, he proposed! There was a waitress taking photos of the big moment! She captured all of the wonderful surprised reactions I had and all the love we share. I am so happy he found someone to get a photo of that moment. \n\nMy sister called ahead for a bottle of champagne for our big moment, which they poured and kept cold for us. \nOur meal came after, I ordered the duck (medium rare) and he ordered the stake (rare). Both cooked to perfection and delicious! \nWe also ordered the  cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e OMG SO GOOD!

As a whole the food was just slightly above average (but still above average and I have higher expectations than most) but there was a few hints of awesomeness tossed in. They bring out a bread basket and one of the little flatbread things in the basket was simply amazing, we sent the waiter back for thirds LOL and the potatoes crouqet were delish and I don't even normally like potatoes.

Ive never had duck this delicious before that now, i want to try duck made from everywhere.  The pan seared one is my favorite its very soft and juicy, it also comes in a dark wine sauce that is great! everything comes a la carte so don't forget to order some sides to compliment your entree.

The first 2 times were wonderful; 4 stars. This last time however was an abysmal 1 star.\n\nFirst of all, the view of the Bellagio and their stunning fountain is fantastic. Romantic, breathtaking and all other adjectives found in thesaurus. The staff is 5 stars all the way; from the helpful hostesses to the swift bread guy that is at your table though out your entire meal making sure you have a new, fresh piece of bread from the 5 different varieties in the basket.  Amazing! Kudos to him. The wait staff is all uniformly good as well - although at one point I finished my glass of wine and instead of refilling it from the bottle at the table, my waitress snatched it away leaving me wine free. I had to flag someone down to get me a fresh glass! And this is in Vegas! Humph, not impressed. \n\nNow, on to the food: My very first time in I ordered the seafood tower - go big or go home, right? It was crazy expense and worth every penny. It was fresh, tasty, totally over the top with how gigantic it was and resulted in a story to be told for years. My second time in was for a family meal. We went traditional with fish or steak entrees; the decadent bacon brussel sprouts on the side as well as potatoes. This meal had nothing negative to comment on.  Overpriced but when you factor in the view, worth it for sure. Now my most recent visit: I decided to really see what the menu was like away from the tried and true entrees. So, I started with Lobster Bouillon soup with lobster flan, Celery and toasted brioche. The soup was creamy, very rich and the brioche was perfect to dip in.  The flan however was like an orange, wiggly, tasteless blob... Like, crazy tasteless. Next I had the worst, over vinegary, kale salad ever. And I love balsamic vinegar, I even drizzle it on ice cream! This salad was horrible, oh, and had 3 tiny cherries.... Thanks, wouldn't want to over cherry, you might take away from the all the vinegar.   \n\nFinally, I was so excited to have the Foie Gras Torchon with duck prosciutto and fig compote. The Foie was slimy on top and congealed so it was hard to break through, I had to use a knife to cut it!  Also didn't have that amazing buttery, melt in your mouth quality; it actually didn't taste much at all. I have never seen or tasted Foie like this - I know Canada is lucky that we have free-range farms and ability to produce amazing, sinfully delicious tasting Foie. This was just disappointing and sad. Hands down the worst Foie I have ever had.  Oh, and the duck prosciutto was as hard as glass. It actually cut my gum open when I tried to chew it. \n\nI would have had dessert but my mouth was bleeding from the duck glass. \n\nLe repas \u00e9tait horrible!"

I was a bit perturbed that you can only secure a widow table via a reservation that is at 5:30 or earlier, but luckily we got one nonetheless. And what a table! As far as a date night, you would be hard pressed to find a better table. The service was very attentive and personable, but I had a major hang-up here. Unless something is jumping out at me, I often rely on the server's opinion and suggestions. It always irks me when the server finds the most expensive option (or close to it) to recommend, and that is what happened here at every step. I realize that it just may be the case that the most expensive everything is the best, but I find it rather unlikely and have been to many 'o joints were this is not the case. The scallop appetizer was outstanding, as were the lamb chops. I did not care for either of the sides (mushroom spaetzle & potatoes gratin), but everything else was great. After reading on how many people harped on the price, I was pleasantly surprised with my visit here and would consider it again for a special night out."

I would think to myself \"hmmm.....it would be nice for a little taste compliments of the chef\" and whamo...right in front of me.  I have no idea what it was that they gave me...some infused something or other...but it was amazing...and free....and compliments of the chef.\n\nThen we were prepared to order dinner.  I had the snapper before so I didn't want to get that again...although it was amazing.  I wanted to expand and try something new.  I saw Arctic Char on the menu.  Strange name....Arctic = Cold and Char = Hot.  I have no idea what type of fish this will be....and once again the waiter says \"you probably are not familiar with Arctic Char....it  tastes a little like a trout and salmon mixed together.\"  Well I be damned if it didn't taste exactly like a trout and salmon mixed together.  It was great.  The chef even seared the skin to make it crispy...which is extremely hard to do without drying out the fish.\n\nThen dessert time.  I ordered the creme brule and my fiance ordered some banana thing.  She asked me if it would be good...and I just said \"come on...stop asking stupid questions...of course it will unless you are allergic to bananas.\"  We inquired about the gelato briefly with the waiter and he told me the gelato is great.  I still wanted my creme brule and she wanted the banana...so gelato will have to wait I guess.\n\nGuess what!?  They send us out this big painter's pallete dish full of one scoop gelato flavors...about 10 of them or so...as a compliment for visiting the restaurant again!  Awesome right?  \n\nI am not a high-roller by any stretch of the imagination, and the restaurant is not affiliated with Caesar's entertainment.  I imagine they rent or have purchased the space in the Eiffel Tower.  What they do is they make great food and have great service.  I will say they have the greatest service...and that is a FACTUAL statement.  I have visited other fine dining restaurants in Vegas and elsewhere and they cannot hold a candle to this place.  They treat you as though you are the only customer...but they do not treat you as a customer.  They treat you as a friend that appreciates great food and they know how to deliver.  Without a doubt this is the place I will always visit when in Vegas."

Before we ordered we told the server in advance that we had a 9pm show. The server said that was fine and it wouldn't take that long. We put our orders in and talked amongst ourselves and snapped pictures while we waited. After waiting 1 hour and 20 mins my party and I were getting nervous about being late for our show. During this wait time we did not even get checked up on!\n\n My boyfriend finally got up and tried to cancel our order with the host, but she told him that she couldn't do that and we had to wait while she paged our waiter. So we waited another 10 mins. Our waiter never showed and a manager came over to charge us and say the beef Wellington took a long time to cook (waiter told us he had it in the oven with 5 others and was coming our fast) tsk tsk. By that point we didn't even want to argue and just wanted to catch our show. Everyone in our party then left and said they would meet us down by the casino.\n\nThen a waiters comes with 1 out of the five entrees I'm guessing in hopes to keep us, but I told him we already canceled our order and he didn't care and went away. Seriously can't you see we have an empty table (bf and I stayed back to pay for drinks) and that we are not at all happy, and again how is one entree out of five suppose to be ok??\n\nWhile leaving we noticed a few other couples tables canceling their orders and leaving also. We thought this was so weird because they had a lot of tables empty... But whatever. We were looking forward to this dinner for weeks and it is so disappointing that it ended this way especially since we went out of the way and told them that we had a show and asked if the dishes we ordered were ok with our time frame. \n\nSo sad I won't ever be returning, but this horrible service was the worst!"

Its got a high class vibe due to the French servers, but there weren't many people in there for Sunday brunch, so it had kind of an awkward feel too.

I had 1/2 an avocado with crab salad and a small cup of coffee. With tax, $35. It was Not worth it. My friend ordered \"onion soup\" What came out was a small bowl of some creamy stuff-no cheeses, no bread, no onion soup au gratinee. And no pre-warning from the waiter. The worst onion soup I have seen for $12. I tried to order artichoke crepes and got something that did not taste like artichokes. but skimpy spinach with a lousy tomato sauce. It was nice of them to take it off my bill since it was terrible and definitely not French. The kitchen was in the forefront of the restaurant for all to see. Frankly, they should hide, considering the mediocre food we received in small portions. I am a native of San Francisco. I've paid steep prices of food, but usually in SF you get what you pay for.

Her cousin Val, seated us right by the window and we had a great view of the Bellagio water show at night as well as views of the strip.\n\nLike most French food, the portions are small, but everything we tried was delicious, we all sampled different things with no complaints.  The wait staff was very attentive to us and kept bringing us out samples to the table of things the chef had created that night.  After our appetizers, our main meals came and Val added on a couple sides to the menu for us to try.    Sorry I can't remember what we all had to save my life, but all of our main course meals were very yummy and so were the sides!\n\nAfter our main course, we each ordered a souffle for dessert, Val once again hooked us up and gave us 3 more desserts including the gelato sampler, creme brulee,  and this other thing that I forgot what it was called.  Either way, my best friend, myself and her fiancee were completely stuffed by the time we were done there.\n\nI definately reccomend this place if you're looking for some fancy French food in Vegas!"

He made reservations on www.OpenTable.com. This restaurant requires a credit card for reservations and if canceled they will charge $50 to your cc.  However, if you need to make changes you can call the restaurant directly rather than going through OpenTable.\n\nWe were seated next to the floor-to-ceiling window that boasted a beautiful view of Bellagio's water show. VERY romantic.\n\nWe started off with a bottle of ros\u00e9 champagne.  Their wine list is spectacular, it's more like a book.  After flipping through 10+ pages I decided to go back to the front and picked a bottle. =P  We also wanted an order of fresh oysters on the half shell but the restaurant did not receive any 'good quality' oysters that day so they weren't available. \n\nHIS:\nSaut\u00e9ed Veal Medallions with Braised Vegetables & Wild Mushrooms = 4 stars\n\nHERS:\nFilet Mignon with Lemon Parsley Butter Sauce = 4 stars\n\nSHARED:\nPotato Gratin = 2 stars\nChocolate Souffl\u00e9 = 5 stars\n\nMy filet mignon was cooked to perfection and paired well w/the lemon parsley butter sauce.  It was much bigger than I expected and even though my fianc\u00e9 had a few bites, I still couldn't finish it.  I tried his dish and the veal medallions were tender and soft. Very delectable sauce w/veggies too.\n\nThe side of Potato Gratin was reasonably priced at $9 but it was below average.  My version of this dish is 10x better, I'm not kidding.   To end the meal, we went with a Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 and it was absolutely divine!!  They had many versions of the Souffl\u00e9, such as: Banana Souffl\u00e9, Grand Marnier Souffl\u00e9, Pistachio Souffl\u00e9, and a couple more that escape my mind.\n\nService was top-notch.  From the moment we got on the elevator to the moment we left. 5+ STARS for great customer service & attentiveness.\n\n\nON A SIDE NOTE: we returned to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant the next evening to have drinks at the bar.  They have a cocktail called \"Eiffel Affair\" and at $20 a pop it was worth every penny!  It resembled a sangria except that it was sparkling and 100x better.  It is also mixed with Stoli Blueberi which gives it a nice kick. MUST TRY!"

Both were unparalleled! \n\nI also had a mimosa and two of their L'orange Faux Cocktails.

You could be seated anywhere and still have a spectacular view of the beautiful Vegas strip and surrounding.  Be sure to get a nice shot with the Paris Ballon in the background.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nStarted off with a couple things actually.  First was this complimentary shot of something that reminded you of a bacon potato soup.  Tres bon! Second, was appetizer--a deliciously warm sweet glazed foie gras! \n\nFor the main course, I savored every single bite of my nicely medium grilled NY-cut steak with glistening bone marrow accompanied with a side of pillowy soft mashed potatoes.  *food coma mode*\n\nLastly, the Chocolate Souffle! They served it by pouring warm, melting chocolate into the souffle.  It was very moist and soft with a balanced sweetness from the chocolate.\n\nOne thing I really appreciated was them filling your glass of water each time it was low.\n\nYou might not be in the real Paris, but the experience here definitely made you feel like you were in the City of Lights.  Merci beaucoup Eiffel Tower Restaurant for a magical and elegant evening."

I requested a window table overlooking the Bellagio Fountains but when they took us to our table it was that. So I went up to the hosts stand and asked if it were possible to sit by the window. They said it would only be a few minutes and we got the perfect seats in the house it seemed like. For a starter we got the Napoleon of Alaska King Crab and Avocado which was phenomenal, very light and fresh flavors, perfect way to start. The main course I got the beef wellington with snap peas. Very good however I did have Gordon Ramsey's Beef wellington a week before and I have to say that was better but it was still very good. The snap peas made a lovely side. Service though! Seemed like our server was very rushed so we had to ask him quickly for what we needed while we had him before he ran off. At this type of cuisine service should be very friendly and inviting. One time I started to ask him something but it was already too late, he was gone in a flash. But other than that it was an excellent experience."

We were stopped in the Paris Hotel casino floor near the base of the Eiffel Tower Restaurant by one of the greeters. She was so kind to give us a look at the menu and give us details as to what to expect. She took us on a tour of the restaurant. The server greeted us as we entered and left the lobby greeter, I must say it was the smoothest transition and hand off ever. The server seated us by the beautiful window view. I don't know how she knew but she took our pictures for our anniversary. I will say, the Bellagio Hotel is the biggest view and attraction for people eating in the Tower, however, the water fountain show doesn't play M-F until after 3pm so don't be shocked there's no water show but it is still a beautiful view.\n   She was more than gracious to explain to us the menu and selections. The food was Deliciono. The servers were all so prompt, professionals and informative while still polite. The entire experience was awesome. Great place to eat at if you want fine dinning and stellar service. The prices are seasonable and affordable. \n  I had a Salmon seared dish. Perfect!! My husband enjoyed a medium rare steak, Perfect!! A must eat location!!!!!!!!"

Great service and very attentive but that's the only plus.\nMy reservation and confirmation I informed them this was for an Anniversary and Birthday. Also the couple with us this was there first trip to Vegas so we wanted a window table so they could see the town.\nOur table was a booth that looked at the window but you could not see anything worth while except the Bellagio sign.\nThe food was mediocre and prices relevant to high end Vegas places. Portions were somewhat small and some of the dishes good and others just ok. \nCome desert I expected something for the occasions I mentioned but nothing as our waiter knew nothing of my requests.\nMy major issue is that there were more \"suits\" in the floor moving around and not once did anyone stop by the table to check on us. A top flight Resteraunt usually has Manger intervention on the floor to insure guest satisfaction. Not here yet many passed our table through the night.\nAll in all my last visit here as I get better treatment and attention at many other places in town."

Forgettable.  The corn and bay scallop soup was decent.  The corn was off, but perhaps being from the midwest I just have a higher standard for corn- especially at $20 a bowl.  The escargot was bland, but not bad.  My wife's beef wellington was spot on, nearly as good as Ramsey Steak.  My rabbit was also bland, and the presentation made it hard to eat- I did eat it all, but I won't remember it next week.  The banana souffle was amazing, best part of the meal.\n\nThe service: Perhaps it was because we were one of the last tables of the night, but the servers were TOO attentive.  Always grabbing things off the table, moving our bread plates, trying to take pictures.  I am all for good customer service, but even for a high-end, high-service restaurant this was borderline intrusive.  Sometimes, less is more."

            "review": "I was not expecting this.  My girlfriend and I sort of fell into the idea of having a French  meal during this trip to Vegas when we saw a travelzoo deal for another restaurant.  That planted the bug in our taste buds, so we started looking and doing comparisons and in the end, had to decide between here and another French restaurant (I forget which).  I was worried about this one because it looked so cheesy.  French restaurant in the Paris hotel which French people probably hate America for building, at a restaurant in the Eiffel Tower, which French people probably hate America for building.  I just didn't think they would do it right.  This is the middle of the desert for pete's sake.\n\nStupid me.  Firstly, Vegas has some of the best chefs in America, so naturally the food would be good.  But it wasn't just good - it was spectacular.  Every bite was delicious.  And the restaurant has more to offer than just delicious food.  It has beautiful views of the Bellagio fountains.  I don't understand why anyone comes here any other time but at night.  You get the lights from Bellagio, Aria, Paris and Caesar's, and you get the fountain shows throughout your meal.  Further, our server was French (so I guess I was wrong about the French hating us for bastardizing their city).  He was gracious and helpful and couldn't have provided more perfect service.\n\nShame on me, but I don't remember what my girlfriend got.  I think she got the sauteed snapper without the bacon (vegetarian), but it might have been the Pacific salmon.  I got the braised short ribs.  I was on a bit of a short ribs kick this year - getting in nearly everywhere we visited, and I think I got it like 3 times in New Orleans in April.  This was, if not the best, then top 2 or 3.  It was to die for.  The sauce was incredible, the vegetables were perfect, and the meat was just right.\n\nWe ended our meal by splitting a creme brulee.  Unfortunately, still not as good as my girlfriend's creme brulee and why she doesn't market it to restaurants is beyond me.  That said, as far as non-girlfriend made creme brulee's go, then again, this was the best or at worst, second best.\n\nThis is Vegas - if you come to a restaurant like this, be prepared to leave with a second mortgage, a payday loan, and maybe even an organ or two after you sold them to pay the bill.  But, when you choose right in Vegas, its well worth the money.  This was one of those meals."

This is the place you need to make a reservation in. \n\nLocated on the actual Eiffel Tower in the Paris hotel, this restaurant is an icon in the strip. You are taken in an elevator by a hostess and brought to the bar area of the restaurant where you check in for your table. \n\nIf you call to make reservations be sure to request the fountain view. At night during the weekends the Bellagio fountains play every 15 minutes and you get to experience this great view from your table as you dine. \n\nThe service is impeccable. Once you check in you will wait a few minutes and you can enjoy one of their signature drinks at the bar. \n\nThe setting is low lighting and the noise is average. It's very cozy once you're inside. Dress code is implemented and this is a restaurant where you want to go looking your best. \n\nWhen you are finally  sitting be sure to enjoy the spectacular view that the location offers. \n\nAll the waiters are very knowledgable of the menu and based on your cravings will recommend you a great plate. \n\nAfter placing your order they will come with a big tray of bread and you can chose which you'll like to eat from the variety that they'll bring. \n\nThis occasion I had the beef Wellington and wow!!!! Made to perfection. The outside pastry was crunchy and the filet came medium rare inside. The flavors of the food are out of this world and you never want your plate to be emptied. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the chocolate souffl\u00e9. It wasn't the best we've had but it was pretty good. It was our anniversary dinner and they surprised us with a complimentary chocolate mouse that was very good. \n\nOur second time in Vegas and we HAD to make reservations here again. We're looking forward to going back and again having our signature plates in the best restaurant this city has!"

You make your way up the elevator and are immediately greeted by someone who takes your coat and leads you to your table, or in our case, since we were a bit early, to the bar.  The bar is nice, great view of the city, top shelf.  Once our table was ready, they came for us, transferred our bar tab and took our drinks and us to our cozy table for two, overlooking the fountains.  It's a beautiful view. The fountains go off.  Impressive.  Ordering al la carte is not cheap.  We opted for the tasting menu ($93.00 pp) WITH their optional wine pairing ($69.00 pp)...This is a great DEAL people.  An appetizer and entree would have been almost as much and we had 5 decent courses of beautifully prepared foods, beautifully presented.  Now that said, the wines were decent but not what anyone would call fabulous; although I found their pairing of the seafood bisque with a Oloroso Sherry, right on!\n\nHave you ever seen the show \"Hello Dolly\"?  Remember the waiter scene, waiters doing the waiter dance with trays held over their heads?  While service was prompt and well timed, there was also a frantic feeling of the waiter dance...and those trays, held over their heads, were happening over our heads and close to our back.  A little disconcerting.  But nothing was dropped or dripped on us so that was a good thing.  And remember those fountains at the Bellagio?  Well, those suckers go off every 15 minutes...so after the first few times...it's like sitting in front of a clock.  \"Has it been 15 minutes already?\"  With a large group, or even maybe a new man (or woman) in your life, that may not be noticed so much, but after 23 years of talking, sometimes you just look at the view, over and over.\n\nThe food was good, a well thought out menu, nicely, although unevenly presented.  My plate came looking one way, his a bit different.  If you are serving two plates of the same thing side by side, they should look exact replicas of each other...at least at this level of service and presentation.  Denny's...not so much.\n\nLindySez:  It's a nice date night.  Great food, great view, if you have something to talk about after the 6th time the fountains go off or, as in our case, talking about the fountains going off...and great service (see if we had been paying attention to the view, we probably wouldn't have even noticed \"Hello Dolly\" was being played out behind us."

When we booked, this was what we were hoping for as my partner and I were off to Las Vegas, just the two of us, to get married and this place kept popping up time and again as being one of the most romantic in town. The reviews were good too so we sent off an email to book and explained that it would be our wedding night. The maitre d' replied back very quickly to confirm our reservation and also to say that he would make sure we got a window table. He also made some really helpful suggestions regarding the menu and the best time to eat for the sunset etc. So from the off, we got lovely service. Just to say as well, don't go into this restaurant on a tight budget as that isn't what it's about and you need to realise that you are paying for a prime view, service and great food. It's, I imagine, for a lot of folks like us a very big treat and to mark some sort of special occasion, so go with it or wait til a time you can fully enjoy! I think ours cost around \u00a3300 including a couple of glasses of champagne and cocktails. On the night itself we arrived very excited and still buzzing and from our greeting at the lift entrance to the restaurant, again nothing but friendly. Getting out at the restaurant you are immediately sure that the place is something special. The surrounding windows with their views out onto the lit-up strip - just wow. The food smelt amazing too! We had a couple of drinks at the lovely circular bar just gazing at the view as we had arrived very early. Once seated - in a fabulous corner window seat no less - we just couldn't believe the view over the Bellagio Fountains. As for the food itself, it was outstanding and I'd say best I've ever had. We had a number of little starter taster-type dishes and I also had the Beef Wellington and then the pre-requisite chocolate souffle. He had the fillet mignon and a pineapple and meringue dessert, the proper name of which I can't remember. So nice. Basically, it was an unforgettable experience and just the perfect meal to mark such a special occasion that we had hoped for. Brilliant and if ever in town again, we will most certainly be back!

My rack of lamb entree was pretty tasty, though it was a little hard to cut.  \n\nBeing a Chicago foodie (hmm that probably sounded pretentious haha), Vegas restaurants don't automatically knock your socks off.  There are lots of great Chicago restaurants to compare (and several of them, like N9ne and Japonais, also opened up shop in Vegas).  Eiffel Tower definitely wasn't 5-star quality.  I would probably be even harder on it if I wasn't on an expense account.  But hey, it's Vegas, so you are expected to pay a lot for everything, right? :)  The view , though, is very unique and adds to a fine dining experience."

You get there by the elevator in the casino, and walk past the kitchen to the restaurant. The food is soooo good! I ordered the baked crepes and my boyfriend had the lamb burger. Both were delicious! They served us some mushroom flan as well, which was surprisingly good, and I don't even like mushrooms. \nThe restaurant is pricey, but it is really nice! The service was friendly and took our picture for us. There weren't many people there for lunch when we got there, so we didn't have to make reservations or wait at all,  but we got there right about when they opened for lunch. I'm sure it's a lot more crowded during dinner.\nIf you are looking for a more upscale restaurant or maybe a place for a date, or to get dressed up, this place is awesome."

We chose the Eiffel Tower Restaurant with the ads promoting the view of the Belagio fountains and the sunset.  We were greeted by 3 hostesses and were seated immediately.  I had requested a table by the window and expressed that a few times.  However, we were seated at a table not only away from the windows but, with huge steal beam to look at.  I told the hostess we did not want to sit there.  We were seated at a table without a steal beam.  Other than that, the evening was perfect!  There was a prix fix meal which was 3 courses, delicious each one and presented to perfection. The service was impeccable and flowed seamlessly. We both were studying the wine list obviously trying to decide which wine we wanted.  The Somalia apparently saw that and came to the table to help us out.  Very observant..we liked that!   The wine he suggested and brought to us was a perfect pairing with our meal.\n\n I was able to see the fountains go off several times and people that did get to sit next to the windows had no problems with me standing behind them taking a few pictures.  We so enjoyed ourselves and certainly had a memorable and romantic dinner!  We  have now put the Eiffel Tower on the list of restaurants we must return to on future Vegas trips.  \n\nThere was one other little issue:  my husband's chair had no padding in it anymore.  He was squirming in his seat and finally told me that his chair was like sitting on concrete.  I told him to say something but, he wouldn't.  We looked at the chairs next to us and figured out that they need to be replaced.  They were pretty much showing a lot of wear and tear.  For not the fact that we were seated in front of a steal beam when asked several times to have a table with a view and the worn out chair, I'd give this restaurant 5 stars!  : )"

I mean, how can a restaurant located on the landing of a fake Eiffel Tower in an amusement park hotel on the Strip in Las Vegas truly ever be considered classy? It couldn't. Anyhow, my dad, stepsister, her friend and I came here for dad's birthday a few weeks ago because he had always wanted to try it. You ride up an elevator to the restaurant and anti-climactically emerge into what amounts to the kitchen.  The layout of the restaurant is in tiers with booths facing out to the windows and a spectacular panoramic view of the Bellagio and its fountains.  The service is quite attentive, however the head waiter was just a tad bit creepy in his mannerisms and tone.  Now, the food is where this restaurant loses two stars because, although obviously quality ingredients, it just wasn't what you'd expect when you're laying out this kind of cash.  Appetizers were fair: Cynthia is right, the carpaccio is excellent, however, being a fan of fast food, it struck me as glorified Arby's meat.  I dunno. The scallop appie only came with two (for 20 bucks). The surf n' turf consisted of a very good fillet, but topped only with a small amount of baked crab meat, not the lobster tail that one would typically expect.  The sauces were just fair.  My stepsister's friend had the whole lobster, the presentation of which was odd: it was upside down and laid open on the plate, with spinach leaves and mushrooms tucked under the meat. Weird. Everything is a la carte, so you lay out more shells for the side dishes.  The potatoes au gratin were quite good, but the sauteed mushrooms a bit flavorless and gummy.  So all in all, have dinner here if its a super special occasion and someone else (such as dad) is footing the bill."

The elevator opens directly into the kitchen pass, which is a unique and rather cool touch I've never seen before. Once you enter the dining room, a dim room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the strip; you're greeted warmly. This is one of the few high-end restaurants I've visited where even a family with a small baby (admittedly a quiet, well-dressed baby) was welcomed by the hostesses. \n\nOur family had made a reservation several months ago, and had specifically asked for a table near the windows. We were given a delightful 3-top with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. Our service team was quiet and well-trained, although they did not quite meet the same level of service that one experiences at Twist. (No holding of chairs for ladies, etc.) My spouse suggested that I might be nit-picking when I complained that they only utilized their crumb scrapers at the end of our meal, rather than after each course. \n\nThe food itself was classical and elegant. We started our meal with a cauliflower creme, sent out by the chef as an amuse bouche. Rich, \"roasty\" and delicious. My son ordered the filet mignon, which was perfectly prepared and delicious. My entree was black cod served on a bed of cauliflower couscous. The fish fell apart when I touched it with my fork- it was tender, moist and very well done. Easily the best non-salmon fish entree I've ever had. My spouse ordered the Wellington, which he was not thrilled with. It was prepared well and he had no specific critique...it just didn't suit him. For sides, we shared the brown butter spaetzl and the green beans. The former was delicious (if a bit on the oily side) while the latter were...just green beans. I'd suggest you be more adventurous if you dine here. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered chocolate cake and apple strudel. My spouse loved the apple dish. I found the chocolate cake to be too rich to finish; which is saying something, considering that I am a die-hard chocoholic and the portion was small. The management also sent over a lovely artists palate of assorted sorbet, with a side of berries. They explained that this was an apology for a drunken diner seated nearby that had to be asked to leave. Considering that we had not even noticed an incident occurring in this very quiet dining room, I think this speaks volumes to the staffs discretion when handing front of the house issues. Honestly? The sorbet (Raspberry, Mango, Green Apple, Creme, and Chocolate) were my favorite desserts. I would order that again in a heartbeat. \n\nIn short? Paris is now my second favorite Las Vegas restaurant (running behind Twist) and is recommended, should you find yourself in that part of the country."

You eat there for the experience and the flavor. Our server told us that the Blue Cheese Souffl\u00e9 was a good started and wow, he was right. Its a tiny little thing, perfect for sharing and it was gooey and soooo good with the little salad that was served with it. It was gone in just a few bites.\n\nWe both ordered Filet Mignon, but since they serve it two different ways, we each ordered one version and sampled both. I got the red wine sauce and she got the lemon butter. I really can't tell you which is better. They were both wonderful. They both made me close my eyes and shutter.\nI ordered Asparagus and Gratin Potatoes also and my friend tried the Pommes Dauphines which are fried balls of potato puff. very interesting. \n\nEven though we had absolutely phenomenal food, we were hungry about an hour later and ended up driving through Sonic on our way to the Palm's."

Also, do remember to dress up for this dining occasion.  I've been here twice, and literally every table in the restaurant has a view of Bellagio's water show.  At night, the strip lights really come alive, and you can take it all in while enjoying a bottle of Grgich Hills cabernet sauv.  This is a great place for a romantic dinner, or a friendly get together.  They definitely have enough waitstaff to accomodate both.  The bartender is friendly, so if you have to wait for a table don't hesistate to grab a cocltail. \n\nI had the roasted lamb rack with a side of asparagus.  The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare, a deep purple in the center.  It was crusted in pepper and served with some grilled tomatoes.  The lamb had the consitency of cotten candy and melted in my mouth.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly in butter and topped with parmesan cheese bits.  The asparagus rivaled my entree in quality.  I also had the opportunity to try the filet mignon, as well as the veal medallions, and both met or exceeded my standards.  We finished with a choclate souffle, which I must wholeheartedly recommend.  \n\nThe service exceeded my expectations.  My drinks never dipped below the halfway point.  There was perhaps one waiter for every person in our party.  Our waiter was friendly, funny, and knowledgeable on every item on the menu.  Overall, a great experience.\n\nAlthough the dinner is very costly, I must recommend it if you love fine dining.  \n\nPROTIP:  You must order the souffle at the beginning of the meal because it takes a while for them to prepare it, so let your waiter know."

We drooled over the menu and called his parents for suggestions on what to eat.\n\nThe following day was spent walking around Vegas, drinking, and eating! We unfortunately planned very poorly and had booked two other things this day: a late lunch and bar show at Kahunaville (prepaid on Groupon) and a naughty (X)Burlesque show to end the night . A 7:30 dinner was stuck right in between the two with not much room on either side. \n\nWe arrived on time and were told to wait at the bar where we ordered a drink from Keith. We actually each ordered a bottle of Hell's Keep ($22.70) and he suggested we share the beer because the bottle was a little bigger than normal and we didn't have a long wait. Perfect - and yummy!\n\nWith sadness we looked over our menus and realized we'd have to get something smaller than we planned since we'd eaten not long before and had to hustle a little for the 10 pm show (we were told to be there no later than 9).  We wanted to be upfront with our server and told him we would be ordering apps and dessert instead of complete entrees. Since we were at a window seat he said that we would probably have to move to another table near the bar. I understood, since seating is the nicest so they want to give it to the people spending the most, but the WAY he said it was not pleasant. Even though we were allowed to stay in the seats, his attitude the entire meal left a bad taste. \n\nWhat we ordered:\nWarm caesar salad ($16.00)\nBlue cheese souffle ($16.00)\nCreme Brulee ($12.00)\n\nWe both agreed the salad was the best of the three. The dressing was fantastic. The souffle wasn't bad either but we found a much better creme brulee another night at Centercut in Flamingo.  Honestly, we really enjoyed the view and the water show from Bellagio, but when I'm spending $50 on an appetizer and dessert I'd like some class from the staff. We should have just moved to the bar area as soon as he first said it."

From beginning to end dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was perfect.\n\nIt starts with the private elevator from the hotel floor up to the elevated restaurant part way up the replica Eiffel Tower at the Paris hotel.  The elevator doors open up to a great view of the working kitchen and a friendly hostess there to guide us over to check-in.  The view is the first thing you notice as the walls are all windows and overlook the strip and particularly the Bellagio lake / water show.  Particularly for couples, all of the two person tables are right up next to the windows with amazing views.  The layout and settings are all beautiful and classy French steakhouse style.  The service, from beginning to end, was great as well.\n\nThe big surprise, for me at least, was that the food was amazing too!  I expected good food amplified by the setting and view, but the food was good enough to stand alone and even justify the hefty prices (at least along the strip).  I had the NY steak, which was one of the best steaks I  have had in a long time including some of the best steakhouses here in Los Angeles, and my wife had the Turbotin (fish) which she raved about as well.  Side dishes, souffle dessert, and wine/drink selections were all great as well.\n\nBottom line, if you want to splurge and have a really great dinner in a beautiful setting, this is the best place on the strip to do it."

She made reservation months in advance so dinner was set for four.\n\nIt was a busy night as we enter into what looked to be a bar/entrance to the restaurant.  There, we were acknowledged and were said to wait until our table was ready.  We sat near the bar and to our non expectation, nobody came to take our orders.  One of my dear friend had to hop onto the bar and asked to be served with cocktails.  \n\nI got the pink velvet.  That was awesomely refreshing alochol drink that hit just the right spot.  The other flavors were gin and tonic and martini by the guys.  Low and behold, we were finally seated a not so great table but nonetheless, overlooking a post wedding dinner and a family celebration. Oh well.\n\nOur waiter for the night was nice and pleasant. Got our menu as well as our order of the the fine wine that we all love Cab.  Cost us $155.  It was exquisite and worth every penny.  My table had the usual, foie gras and meat was the order of the night.  I went for the braised shortribs.  Very tender and delish. The lamb and the muscovy duck were good I was told by my eating companions that complimented very well with our wine.  \n\nTo end the night, we four shared two souffles--chocolate and pistacchio.  I preferred the chocolate.  Overall, a great night of food with wonderful friends.  A romantic night out with a great couple. Nice ambience. Tab was steep but well worth it. Hey, we are in Vegas so we should eat like one--at least once in a while."

The waitstaff was quick to send over a manager to check on him and take his information should he have needed to have anything done, but the damage was already done.

We opted for wine-by-the-glass, but the list was MBA/CPA optimized for maximum gouging.   The menu was strangely limited, although each category - beef, fish and non-beef - about 6 selections each, was hardly stimulating.  New York Strip, rib eye, rabbit, halibut.  Yawn.  Started off with a vichyssoise that tasted like it came from a can.  The taste of the French bread was terrible!  Local Vietnamese sandwich shops offer fresh French bread with better texture & taste.  Then we waited - for an hour before the mains were served.  The average entre price is $50.  Salads are $12.  With so many fabulous restaurants in greater Las Vegas, we're loath to return.  All the view in the world didn't make the dinner experience any better.\n\nSemi-retired food snob.

Eiffel Tower Restaurant was going to kick off a spectacular night of good food, strong drinks, and luck at the poker tables...and it did just that; with style!~\n\nUpon entering the establishment, I was startled by the kitchen being right in front of me as I exited the elevator. This was interesting but it is very crowded and hurried when you exit the elevator so you dont really have time to take it in. \n\nThe restaurant itself is much smaller than I imagined but in a good way. It is very romantic... We were seated promptly as we had a reservation. Our waitress was simply a joy and I truly enjoyed her presence throughout the evening. \n\nA server comes around and you get to choose your own bread; that was a nice touch and the server was very very friendly and attentive. I like the server nearly as much as I enjoyed the waitress. \n\nThey bring out a complimentary amuse- I believe it was a calliflower soup?- It was served cold but it was absolutely delish! At that moment, I had full confidence that this dinner was going to be amazing! Did not disappoint~\n\n\nMy husband had the lamb for his entree and I had the halibut. I cannot speak about the lamb as I do not eat meat but my husband said it was cooked to perfections; which I guess is difficult to do with lamb. \n\nThe halibut was to die  for but what I enjoyed more about that entree was the bulgar wheat. The restaurant called it couscous but I am quite certain it was bulgar wheat made into a splendid tabouli! I attempt to make tabouli all the time and it is quite difficult to make really well so I was very impressed! As a side dish we had the mushroom spaetzel?- To this day we still cannot figure out if we were eating mushrooms made to look like noddles or actual noddles that were mushroom flavored. It was truly bizarre but I loved it for being different (and super tasty) \n\nFor dessert we have espresso and the Grand Marnier Souffle~ \n\nI dont think I have ever had Souffle before and it stole my heart! I probably would have choosen a different flavor next time as I do not think the Grand Marnier added much to it but it was cooked to perfection! \n\nMy husband had a great idea that when the Bellagio water show comes on, the music in the restaurant should be timed to play the same music that is going on at the water show. I must say the water show does not leave as strong of an impression without the music to go along with it.  \n\nPricey dinner at nearly $200 for 2 people but in my opinion it was worth every cent!"

Service is top notch, as it should be in a place like this.  The hubby is kind of a jokester and asks the waiter for \"their 2nd cheapest bottle of wine.\"  But the waiter was cool, it's not so stuffy that you feel out of place.  Wine was wonderful, my glass was always refilled, which is amazing because I can down the vino pretty quickly.  I had the surf and turf which I highly recommend.  The hubby had duck, which he enjoyed.  All the sides that our party ordered were excellent.  Definitely can be shared.  All pricey but worth it, plus the view speaks for itself."

I'm glad we decided to go back.\n\nAs in the past, the atmosphere is vibrant and polished. I always wear a jacket but there are some without. Business casual is fine. You should expect to spend 2 - 3 hours for dinner here but the server will ask you if you have a show or event to attend later in the evening to help you get out in time. Do make a point to arrive early and have a drink at their bar. The view from bar (and the entire restaurant) is awesome. \n\nOnly negative- I was told that we could only get a table at the window facing the Bellagio fountains if we were seated as 2. We were 4 so we settled for a table on the second tier but saw some of the Bellagio show. I was distressed, however, to see some tables for 3 and 4 set up in that first tier to see the Bellagio show as they dinned. I guess I didn't speak to the right person when I made my reservation.\n\nMy smoked salmon starter was outstanding. As in our past visits, my wife and I had the filet mignon. And as in the past it is the best filet I have ever had. Instead of going to one of the many steak houses on the strip, save your steak night for Eiffel Tower and order the filet. You will not be disappointed. \n\nYes, of course, we had to order their famous souffles. We ordered the chocolate with chocolate sauce and, as a twist, chocolate with banana sauce. You cannot order incorrectly whatever flavor you order. Don't worry about the flavor-just order it! Everyone also get a a small tray of sweets to end the meal.\n\nTheir wine list is extensive and the sommelier will help you if you are not used to ordering French wines. The service was attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nIt is pricey, but worth it. Save this place for you big night out and you will remember it for a long time.\n\nI only go back to restaurants if they earn it. Eiffel Tower Restaurant earns it year after year."

There is a dress code for men...pants and socks required.\n\nOn a whim, with a friend, we decided to go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant inside the Paris Hotel and Casino. No reservations, but pouf! A dress code. And, while not inexpensively dressed by any standards, my friend was showing an alarming amount of shin and toe cleavage. Luckily, the reservation manager was well-prepared and had tuxedo pants loaners stashed under his table, plus a large cache of black socks.\n\nSo, my pal pulled on the pants over his shorts, and put socks on with his, O-MI-GOD, sandals. Quelle horreur!! La scandale!!\n\nAnyhoo, we were seated right away, up against the window overlooking the Paris balloon and the Bellagio waters. With the setting sun in our eyes, we had a spectacular view.\n\nThe service from our waiter, Oliver, was 90% fabulous. He went MIA toward the end, but had been flawless until that time.\n\nBut, that brings us to the food. The appetizers and sides were delicious. The main courses, not so much. A bit dry and drab. So, my recommendation would be to do a series of appetizers and side dishes (the entrees are a la carte, naturellement), and save room for dessert!"

The hope is that the food is good, the service excellent, yadda yadda.\n\nAnd in my book, this place is just okay -- especially considering the prices.\n\nFirst off, we didn't really make reservations, so they sat us away from the windows facing that way cool Bellagio water show. The date asked about it, and the fancy-pants hostess make some comment that was like \"oh, those seats are for reserved guests.\" \n\nOkay, whatever, you lose a star for not seeing a couple that was willing to pay for the place.\n\nNow I actually thought the walk past the kitchen was cool, because it was SPOTLESS. Not bad. You get back part of a star.\n\nThe service was pleasant, but I thought a bit over-frenchified like they were trying too hard to be French without them being French. If you have a French restaurant and you expect people to pay $90 a person, they better speak French. You lose another star, my friend.\n\nThe duck was a bit \"tough\", and figuring this was a fancy pants Paris restaurants, you would think that the duck would have been better. The venison was good. The date had a souffle. It was cool how they poured the sauces in, but the souffle wasn't \"top notch.\"\n\nNice place? Sure, can't beat the view, it you get one of those tables.\n\nWould I go back? No. This is one of those enforced fancy restaurants for the masses -- bring in the celebrity chef to create a menu, and serve high priced average food to people that don't better."

I was trying to discretely get all the sauce from the plate! We ordered the pork chop and rabbit with two potato dishes on the side. One was mashed and I can't remember the other. Portions were bigger than I thought and I was pleasantly surprised. Waiter was nice and explained the menu and didn't make me feel dumb for asking what certain dishes are. We had a great experience which lasted about 2 hours. I think they intentionally take their time so you can enjoy the view. We had a souffl\u00e9 which was alright.

I made a reservation on open table a couple weeks beforehand because I knew I wanted to come here with my mother while we were visiting Las Vegas. They do ask to hold a credit card to make the reservations which is a good thing to be aware of when making a res. \n\nFrom the moment we went up the elevators from the Casino Floor everyone was extremely friendly and uber attentive. I have sat at the bar a couple times to have champagne and watch the fountains but this was the first time I have eaten there, we made a lunch reservation. They sat my mother and I at an incredible table overlooking the strip- with a view of the Bellagio Fountain Water Show. \n\nSebastian our waiter, and a true French transplant, was beyond words. He was attentive, friendly, professional and made us ladies feel like a million bucks. At one point he \"noticed\" I was cold and wrapped a pashmina around my shoulders in the restaurants matching crimson red color. I have been to some very upscale restaurants but I must say Sebastian was definitely one of the most incredible servers I have ever had. He lavished us with just the right amount of attention and even a special dessert!! \n\nThe food was delicious, by far our favorite meal we had while in Vegas. We started with cocktails- I had The Painkiller (delicious) and my mother had the Signature Eiffel Tower cocktail- also delightful. To start we shared the French cheese plate, which came with three different cheeses-really really amazing. And then both had the Salmon Paillard- which was fresh and amazing. We finished the meal off with the trio of sorbets which were great but paled in comparison to the delicious special pot de creme, Sebastian gave us as a thank you, holy moly it was heavenly. \n\nOverall this place has the best, food, service and decor I have ever experienced on The Las Vegas Strip...clearly I could go on and on...can't wait to make it a staple. Thanks Eiffel Tower Restaurant!!!!"

Every ten minutes we watched the water show. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable. He picked out the perfect white wine for our meals. I got the skirt steak which was amazing. My boyfriend got the filet mignon also delicious. We shared the asparagus and gratin potatoes as our sides since the menu is a la carte. Of course we had to try the chocolate souffl\u00e9 that everyone talked about on Yelp (which is the reason we even came to this spot). And man oh man....it was soooo good. The ambiance of this fine dining restaurant is surprisingly casual. I figured since it was fine dining then it'd be full of stuck up rich folks...but that wasn't the case at all. Everyone was laughing and having a good time. It made our experience that much better.

You take an elevator up too the restaurant, which is really cool. I recommend going in the day time if you want to save some cash. Probably a great place to take your lady to if you want to be romantic. Would not recommend doing this on a first date though as it would probably be a bit much. Minus half a star for SLOW food.

            "review": "A girlfriend and I came in for lunch on Saturday to take advantage of the prix fixe menu they offered in support of Las Vegas Restaurant Week. \n\nI loved the seating/reservations coordinator downstairs. She checked my name in the computer, confirmed to the restaurant upstairs that I was in the building, and led us into the elevator. It was, at once, very posh and attentive, but cool and casual and welcoming. Definitely a good start.\n\nThe elevator opens up to the kitchen. A great touch; I love to see the kitchen and have a sense of what is going on with my food! Walk to the right and you enter into the bar area and see the hostess desk. You also see that there really isn't a bad seat in the place. It is tiered so as to offer, as much as possible, a view to every diner. Great idea. The decor is upscale and comfortable, simple and elegant without putting off the casual diner.\n\nWe were seated at an intimate two-person table on the window, facing the Bellagio and fountains. C'est parfait! Tres jolie! We loved the show against a somewhat dreary day in Las Vegas; the lights lit up the water and made the view (and by proxy the ambiance of the restaurant) that much more beautiful.\n\nService was spectacular. Everything was timed perfectly, from the amuse to the apps to the entrees to desserts. Wine service was expedient and attentive. Everything was explained well, if not a little too rehearsed; we heard the same spiel over and over, almost verbatim, to tables around us. Hint: change it up a bit, add some personality and personability to it! Still, friendly, capable, and humorous when appropriate, everyone was on their game.\n\nMmmmm, food. This *is* a restaurant, after all.\n\nDrinks: We opted for wine by the glass, but they did have some yum-sounding signature cocktails... for about $18 a piece. Just not worth it to me... I can have three glasses of wine to your one cocktail and be happier for it. Others around us were loving their drinks, and I see value in that on occasion, but it was something we skipped... this time.\n\nAmuse: a light but flavor-FULL mushroom flan with a small piece of mushroom on top. Savory goodness in less than a bite and one of the best fungi preparations I have had the pleasure of eating in a long time.\n\nApps: The foie gras (not on the LVRW menu, but ordered as an extra) was absolutely phenomenal. Served cold, it was a large, thick slice straight off the liver. Nothing formed or cubed or otherwise manipulated, it was marbled by veins and perfect. As if that's not amazing enough, it was wrapped in duck prosciutto. Yeah, drool-worthy.\n\nThe spinach and grueyere streudel was good. I hoped for more cheese, and I found the crust to be a bit too hard. That said, the flavors were solid and the spinach was fresh. Not a bad dish.\n\nEntree: The flank steak had a great flavor and the cabernet jus was delicious. But there was something about how it was cut... almost against the grain? Sadly, it was also a little tough. We ordered them medium rare (I even added \"more on the rare side\") and they were closer, I think, to medium. Great flavors, but a little lost on execution.\n\nDessert: The peach tartin was fantastic. The pastry was light and crisp, the peaches were fresh, sweet and tender, and the basil ice cream with piece of crispy basil was a lovely, sweet and savory complement to the rest of the dish. Really, really done well.\n\nI never felt rushed, the meal was very good and the prices were good. Aside from the prix fixe decision we made, the foie gras was only $20 (and compared to other places I have been lately, that's an amazing deal for what they offer. Definitely a fave!). With 2 glasses of wine each and all of the above, it was only $65 or so each before a tip. Very much worth the visit!\n\nFor next time... I see wine and foie gras and dessert at the bar. Casual yet still surrounded by the intimate elegance... and with a fabulous view."

The elevator to the restaurant is located in the middle of the Paris casino. \n\nAmbiance: Excellent. In terms of view of the Bellagio fountain this is probably the best place to dine! (Be sure to ask for a good table if you come here for the view ;).) \n\nFood: Good. The first time I came here with my girlfriend we had lamp chop and a steak. I thought those dishes were quite average. The second time I came here with my clients, and we had the chief's tasting menu which I thought it was definitely one of the better tasting menu I had come across. The Foie Gras, which is duck liver was amazing! \n\nParking: Good. Free parking if you don't mind the walking. On the other hand valet is only $3~5 bucks depends on how much you want to tip. I always valet when I'm in Vegas it is so freaking convenient! \n\nService: Excellent. First of all there are people greet you right at the elevator, and will escort you to the restaurant. If you are having the tasting menu, your utensils will be swapped out for clean ones after every course. And oh, beware they have restroom attendants, be sure to bring some cash for tips. Water is always filled on time, sometimes the VP/manager will walk around and personally make sure everything is ok. \n\nConclusion: Hands down one of the best view in Vegas! Good food. Over the top service. A good place to impress a date/client. Dinner for two, expect the bill to be $200 if you order off the menu. $280 ~ $450 if you are getting the tasting menu."

Amazingly we got seated at a window table but we suspect that was maybe a \"faux pas\" on their part as we had not paid for that - a hostess came over to question our reservation name 5 mins after we sat down.\nVery obsequious waiter (hand clasping etc) came over and did his stuff, then sommelier steered us to a great choice of wine based on what we wanted, food paring and our budget (wine list starts at $65, goes up to infinity, and he talked us into a lower priced wine than we originally were going to order so respect that).\nWe ordered our food and all was good.  Fantastic smoked salmon starter which we shared (red flag for waiter maybe), then main courses came out.  One reason I took my wife here is because she wanted to try Beef Wellington (she's a Gordon Ramsey fan). That came out \"well done\"  and no pink in the middle at all (still very tasty and not dried out but not as any online recipe suggests).  My lamb cutlets were meant to be \"medium\" but were verging on bloody/raw.  Not very impressive!\nThe service from the waiter had gone downhill rapidly and it was hard not to assume he had figured out we were not \"big spenders\" so he would be better off focusing his attention on other higher spending tables.  Hardly saw him after that and the dessert menu was just plopped on the table without any comment as I was looking out of the window while my wife was in the restroom.\nThe overall experience left a sour note and was frankly disappointing.  Sure, a $250 meal for 2 plus a $50 tip is peanuts from the waiter's perspective in an establishment like this but to be so blatantly dismissive was rude and really tarnished the experience I was hoping to give my wife.  Will not be going back."

Quality of meats fish etc is top so you are safe with a steak. However, there is no special touch added to these dishes. Place is not set up to give individual attention before being seated. They have a system that requires a queue check in. Not exactly first class The elevator leaves you in the kitchen. Young women at reception are full of themselves and not very welcoming. I sent back a soup that was supposed to be lobster based. Medium sized bowl was $18; soup was light not tasty and had never been near a lobster. Wine prices are ridiculous, even for LV. A lowly Broully goes for $70+. That's about a 500% markup. The $75 corkage charge guarantees you will pay mucho if you must have wine. This place reminds me fondly of The Jules Verne restaurant in the real Eiffel Tour in Paris. It now has 2 Michelin Stars allowing it to charge high prices. However, the food and service are impeccable at about twice the price of the LV Eiffel. The view of the Seine and Chaillot Palace are stunning. You can see the Bellagio fountains for free at street level or even stay at Bellagio for less than your tab at this Eiffel. Oh: Lest I forget. The service has always been professional here. Why am I not surprised that Michelin has stopped rating Las Vegas restaurants. Walking through the now tacky Paris Hotel is not a great appetizer either."

Not wowed by my dish although the serving size was huge, but did enjoy the bite of filet I stole from my hubby's plate. Lastly, in order to have the souffl\u00e9 for dessert, you must order 25-30 min in advance, so we basically were forced to look at the dessert menu as soon as we placed our order for our meal which was weird. We got the Nutella souffl\u00e9 which was only okay. All in all, I don't see myself returning here since there are a ton of better places to eat in Vegas..."

I was convinced we wouldn't be able to get in to the Eiffel Tower, but was surprised when they said just wait in the bar a few minutes.  \n\nWe ended up ordering drinks and a cheese plate in the lounge part of the bar and we were surprised when they came to get us only 15 minutes later!\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the Eiffel Tower restaurant.  I expected to find very over-priced menus with food unworthy of the hype.  I am happy to say that this is not the case.  \n\nAll of our food was wonderful.  We had the Filet Mignon, the Beef Wellington, and the chocolate souffle.  Yum!  The service was excellent, the view was amazing, and we had a wonderful meal."

Stupid me thought the restaurant would be at the very top of the tower. I realized that wasn't true when the elevator ride up to the restaurant was all of 5 seconds. Kinda took the magic of Paris away.\n\nWhat I was also hoping was that the food would be better. If it's any consolation, the escargot was great. It was my first time eating this dish, and I really enjoyed the textures that came through. Well done. The \"warm\" lobster salad came out COLD and it was also quite bland. It also was difficult to eat. Do NOT order it. The rest of our food was overcooked and overseasoned. My seabass was dry, and my boyfriend's ahi tuna was practically cooked all the way through. He wasn't too happy with this and even offered his two cents for my Yelp review (which he never usually does). Salvation came at the end of the meal in the form of creme brulee. At least the French really know their desserts. In spite of all this, the service was very attentive and superb. They deserved their tip that night.\n\nMy advice is that if the view of the strip and Bellagio fountain show really matter all that much to you, then go ahead and have dinner here. But if you really want the main event to be your food, take your money elsewhere."

I've also tried their lemon-raspberry treat on another occasion, equally as good with a raspberry sauce that compliments the dessert just like you'd expect.

Exciting food, delectable flavors, and ingredients that you would never think of pairing together having a party in your mouth.

He saw, but didn't apologize. \n\nI'm giving two stars for the view. We both ordered filets that were too chewy to be the quality we were paying for $70 each. The sides were bland, not exciting or creative. The only saving grace was the king crab salad as the appetizer.\n\nWe did get 6 mini little \"treats\" at the end of the meal!!! But, after a $300 tab for two of us, that's not the happy ending I would expect."

I really enjoy the ride up the elevator and the friendly VIP greeting prior to getting in the elevator and while exiting into a busy buzzing kitchen with chefs running around in white aprons and hats.\n\nWe arrived prior to sunset and we were seated against the window on a half moon table with views of the strip and the Bellagio Fountains.  Our waitress was super friendly, warm and hospitable.  \n\nOur drink orders were taken right away. We were offered some recommendations and a menu featuring specialty cocktails was a big help.  I ordered a Lemon Drop Martini which was very good and my husband ordered the Eiffel Tower with infused berry's-which he ordered so I could try and it was a bit tart for me.  The drink almost looks like you could pour it over a bowl of vanilla ice-cream, it was heavy syrupy consistency but it packed a punch.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eiffel-tower-restaurant-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=Y5k8bMJLW1S8xBf8L3vxSA&userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ#C0vYkF1CZXXOs_OOEtXE7A\n\nWe opted for the tasting menu at $125 pp which takes you into about a three-hour experience.  Wine pairings for an additional $79 pp was also an option. The highlights were the scallops-texture flavor mmm cooked to perfection. Foie Gras was very good but needed a bit more sweetness on the plate, the venison was my least favorite-although it was cooked very well the clove or anise spices were too intense which since it's already gamey it was overpowering despite its purpose to enhance.  The starter was a wonderful little shot of cold onion soup-it was creamy and delicious. Dessert was a wonderful delicious chocolate souffl\u00e9 and a plate of sorbet's. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eiffel-tower-restaurant-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=Y5k8bMJLW1S8xBf8L3vxSA&userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ#-_1Xz5jqO2AvQ5T3gFGnYA\n\nWe were debating where to have dinner. Since last year we were at the Bellagio and had a terrible experience I wasn't excited to go back to try one of their restaurants. The Wynn was also a contender but Eiffel Tower won us over simply due to nostalgia and the views.\n\nThe last time we were here we had a party of four with us and had a bigger table which offered more elbow room.  I wasn't a big fan of the smaller tables and some of the customers weren't dressed to impress which is always off-putting because the restaurant is plush red velvet and elegant.  I think the price per person was a bit steep for the value.  Overall the service was fabulous.  I do plan on coming back maybe just next time for dessert at the lounge."

The service was terrible! Maybe it was only us, but there were many things wrong. I have to blame most of my horrible experience on the waiter (who was the oldest man there!). He asked us in the beginning if we wanted their chocolate souffle, and told us that it would take about 30 min-1 hr to make, so he recommended us to order it in the beginning. So, we did. We waited a long time for our main entrees of salmon and filet mignon, but we didn't mind since my boyfriend and I were watching the Bellagio water show almost every 15 min there. I also ordered some scallops that were pretty good for an appetizer. At any rate, a couple behind us arrived 15 min after us, but were served before us. We found out later, as they stopped to eat their food, that they received the wrong order. It was ours, since I overheard them mentioning their sides. It just happened that they ordered the same main entrees as us. The waiter brought it back to the kitchen, and later brought it out (I know it was reheated in the kitchen) and gave it to us! I know this because my dish was overcooked and my side was on my plate! Horrible! \n\nNot only did they get our main entrees wrong, but the dessert didn't come until an hour after our main entree was finished! The waiter kept telling us it would be coming out, and blamed that the oven was broken (when in reality....he FORGOT that we ORDERED IT!). \n\nThere was nothing really special about the dishes. I definitely would not go back there again, especially if that waiter is there! I know this restaurant has a long waiting list, but it was not worth the wait in the end."

You get a beautiful view of the Bellagio and it's fountains, it's quiet, and oh so relaxing.\nThe service was great, nothing they could of changed.\n\nThey started us out with parmesean balls, and a mushroom flan before our meal and it was a great starter.\n\nI ordered their eggs benedict, omg so yummy. I think it was also topped with some spice, the bread it sat on was perfect and crisp! They serve really good iced tea by the bottle called Republic Darjeeling Tea. I read it's the \"champagne\" of teas. I want to go back!\n\nAhh I love French dining..."

I thought it was perfect, but I could have eaten more it was so good. \n\nMen: DO dress with at least a button down shirt and slacks or dark jeans with no rips... I saw the host loaning a button down shirt to a guest who came in a t-shirt... I am assuming they were not going to let him in wearing a t-shirt."

I completely agree with this, but I'd like to offer up another reason to visit this fabulous restaurant.\n\nRecently, I had four business associates visit Las Vegas for a convention at Mandalay Bay. It was my job to entertain them during the hours they were free from meetings.  Immediately when they arrived, I scooped them up and brought them to ETR.  They were completely blown away.  We sampled delicious cocktails (The Daisy and Autumn in Paris) and amuse trios in the lounge overlooking the fountains.  Michelle was our server and she was fantastic.  Two managers, Laurent and Ehsan, stopped by to welcome us.  It was a phenomenal experience, and my guests loved it so much that they came back to the restaurant for both lunch and dinner later in the week.  They also went back to the convention telling their fellow associates how wonderful it is.\n\nSo - while it's perfect for romance,  also know that in any type of business related situation, when you're looking for a place to wow and impress, be sure to visit the Eiffel Tower Restaurant!"

Well with all the things happening down at the Paris and on the strip four of our guest were late. At 3:45 the hostess came and told us we had to order immediately or we could not eat, keep in mind that we had order appetizers and drinks. When she did that I felt disrespected because if you gave us the last reservation for brunch then you know what is going on in the hotel and people would be delayed. Then our four guest arrived within five minutes and our waiter took our order. I ordered the Eiffel Tower Burger and it was good the only bad thing about it was it was greasy. I will go back but I think they do better with smaller parties versus 13 people. \n\nI would have given 4 or 5 stars but if you give a party of 13 the last reservation do not nicely force them to leave by offering the dessert menu when people are still eating. We spent over $400.00 and I think they could have worked with us better knowing the type of money we were spending."

It was a Tuesday night so we didn't think they would be booked up but just in case I called ahead to see how busy they were and if we should make a reservation.  The lady on the phone assured us that they weren't that busy and that they should be able to find us a table but we didn't need to put our name in.  When we arrived, sure enough there were plenty of tables.  However, when my fiance asked to be seated, the hostess was very rude to him.  She spoke to him in a very condescending way as if he was not important enough to be seated and that we should have had a reservation.  It really ruined our love for this restaurant.  We decided to celebrate at Twist at the mandarian oriental instead and were treated with the hospitality one would expect.  We are locals and we will not be going back to Eiffel Tower.  We also will dissuade anyone who visits from eating there.  I'm really disappointed."

We were a bit early about 6 or 6:30, so the restaurant was not filled yet. We entered from the elevator right into the kitchen viewing area. Not sure of the reason for this, but it's nice that you can view the kitchen at work if you want to. But I don't think entering the restaurant to this area is the best idea. Anyway, we rounded the corner to a beautiful restaurant and bar area. The hostess greeted us and we were seated in just a few minutes. I think this was so we could take the place in for a moment (which we did.) We were seated near the far corner, about center of the Bellagio. I was excited as this was my GF's first trip to Vegas and this was the place to see the fountains. Unfortunately they didn't start until 7, but that was ok, because we got to meet our waitress, Alix. She was one of the most pleasant and professional wait staff I've ever encountered. She was on it from the moment she arrived. The Champagne was wonderful, as were the Filet and the Salmon. Finally during the meal, the fountains started. It was a great vantage spot and the GF loved it! Dessert was a small cake and ice cream. A great restaurant is measured by many things and The Eiffel Tower hit them all for me."

You have a full view of all the lights of Vegas and  directly overlook the Bellagio fountain show which is quite frankly incredible!!  The service was good/great and the drinks were delicious. The price tag is high but in my opinion that's to be expected in Vegas especially with a view like this...

Both people who ordered the filet had to send it back because it was not cooked properly (both were ordered medium, and one came out well done, the other one rare).  Someone else got food poisoning from the salmon dish.  The only good dish were the lamb chops (cooked properly and had good taste).  Usually restaurants that have family style sides will give you a reasonable portion. Not here.  Each side dish will feed 2 people,  maybe.  The steaks and fish are served without any garnish.  We ordered a celebration cake for my father, and the cake was atrocious. Nobody even ate it.  We were taking a photo with my dad and some waiter came and crouched next to him to get in the photo. Really?? At a \"5 star\" restaurant?? All in all it was a waste of money and calories.  With so many actually good options in Vegas, please do not eat here.  It took 3 hours to leave the restaurant! The service was painfully slow, meals were cooked improperly and we got one case of food poisoning.  One of the worst meal experiences of my life.  The view of the strip is not worth that kind of pain."

We thought that we would splurge and enjoy a nice meal with a good view of the strip.  Upon sitting down I was stunned by the view, however, the tables were all too close and I was a little annoyed at having to hear the whole conversation of the people next to us.  The server was nice but honestly our service was very slow.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the ocean salad which was loaded with tastey things.  It had crab, lobster, prawns, artichokes, celery, avocado and best of all a delicious light vinaigrette dressing.  It was large sized which surprised me because most of the time at high end restaurants portions are tiny.  They really didn't skimp on anything.\n\nMy bf ordered a lamb hamburger that was delicious.  It was not overly gamey and it came with carmelized onions, peppers, chips, and a delectable sauce.  The bread was also really good.  It had anise seeds in it.  I have to say though I was a bit po'd when I got the bill and realized that my mediocre bloody mary cost $14!  I immediately wished that I had sent it back.  Oh well.  What can you do?  This is a great date place or reception restaurant.  I don't know how often I'd come  ($70 lunches aren't really my thing) but for a special occasion it is perfect!"

James was our expert server this evening, and he did a nice job tending to a table of eight.\n\nFood was very good, but not unbelievable.  Vegas prices set the expectations bar high for most of us, and that bar simply wasn't achieved.\n\nWe were greeted by a nice little amuse bouche of cauliflower, a surprise that was both tasty and welcome.  A bread selection was offered and along with soft butter was a crusty treat.  I liked the rustic variety.\n\nAppys:  The Maine Lobster Salad with Roasted Butternut Squash, Wilted Kale and Old Cider Vinaigrette was tasty enough, albeit a small portion for $24.  The Cold Smoked Salmon with Classic Condiments was very good at $19 and more substantial than the lobster.\n\nEntrees:  James told us a story about the Duke of Wellington and Napolean that prompted an order of the Beef Wellington.  The preparation was classic, though without the liver pate.  Actually that is the way my fellow diner preferred it, and the dish came out perfectly prepared, medium rare and delicious.\n\nTwo others, including myself, ordered the short ribs which were underwhelming.  Four small bits of beef were accompanied by several baby carrots and three baby onions.  The brown sauce adorning the plate was a little too forward for my taste and quite a bit different from what we are used to eating in most establishments.  I want to say it was vinegar-ey, but I really am not sure what the unique flavor I tasted was.  I miss my Cafe 14 in Agoura Hills' short ribs!!!\n\nDessert included a caramel souffle which, too, was underwhelming.  Flavor was very light, even with the requisite caramel sauce.  If you go for the souffle I would recommend the chocolate variety.\n\nWe are used to paying Vegas prices, but although the Eiffel Tower had great vistas and good service, the value equation wasn't there at these high prices.  C'est la vie!"

            "review": "I seriously wanted to avoid coming here, and I really should've after reading some not-so-consistent reviews.  But we were celebrating both of my parent's birthdays, and they were insistent on eating at Eiffel Tower.  (oh well, gotta make the parents happy)\n\nOk, well let's get started.  As you get off the elevator, you're immediately presented with the kitchen which is actually kind of cool.  The nice lady walks you to the hostess and so far I'm feeling hopeful.  We get seated immediately in a decent booth, but we really can't see much of a view.  I did specially request a nice view, but that didnt work out so well.  The atmosphere was just ok, and kind of on the loud side.\n\nWe started off with with the Roasted Foie Gras, White Almond Dusted Sea Scallops and Warm Lobster Salad for appetizers.  The foie gras was good but I've had much better, and the accompanying marinated grapes weren't the best match.  You really need something sweeter to go with the rich flavor of foie gras.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the lobster salad was probably my favorite.  At this point you're probably wondering - why 2 stars?  Well, read on my friend...\n\nFor entrees, we ordered Filet of Seabass, Venison Chop, Surf and Turf Beef Tenderloin, and the Bone-in Ribeye.  The seabass was cooked just right but the seasoning was non-existent.  The Venison was cooked perfectly as well and we were pretty pleased with that dish.  The Surf & Turf Beef Tenderloin was quite a disappointment.  The crab meat was like a dried out crab cake, and although the tenderloin was cooked perfectly, it had no flavor at all.  It didn't even have a nice char, which definitely makes a good steak.  The ribeye was probably the best entree of them all.  Nice and juicy and actually seasoned well too.  We also had a side order of scalloped potatoes which was a total waste of money.  At this point the food has been just OK and if you look at the prices, it's really not worth it at all.  But I guess it is Vegas and almost all of the high end restaurants are at least $40 per entree (easy).  Am I just spoiled with the quality and service of San Francisco restaurants?  I haven't yet mentioned anything about service yet, but it was just ok at this point.  Nothing like the Dining Room at the Ritz in SF, and our server seemed way too busy with another table that he really didn't come to check up on us at all.  The rest of the staff was fairly attentive, but I would expect way better service for a restaurant like this. \n\nAh yes, dessert.  My absolute favorite course of any meal.  I'm hoping that my opinion of the restaurant will change with dessert.  Of course like everyone else, we did get suckered into ordering a souffle at the beginning of the meal, so that was already on its way.  So we wait, and wait, and still no dessert menu.  Someone finally brings us new place settings, but still no dessert menu.  Do they not have a dessert menu?  We can't even find our server because he obviously has way too many tables.  Someone finally brings our souffle, and at that point we asked him for dessert menus.  He says he'll bring them right away....yeah right.  The souffle was delicious I must say, and they were kind enough to bring out complimentary desserts to wish my parents a happy birthday.  But where's my dessert menu??! ! At some point I just gave up because I was so annoyed.  Now you know why I give Eiffel Tower Restaurant only 2 stars.\n\nBy the end of the meal, I am annoyed that we have a huge bill to pay and we got a less than satisfactory fine dining experience.  I'm really wishing that I had just made reservations at Picasso in the Bellagio or at Guy Savoy instead.  I could've even just gone back to Delmonico's, Michael Mina, Bouchon, Fleur de Lys, all where I've had way better experiences than this.  \n\nIn conclusion...\nFood=3 stars\nAmbiance=3 stars\nService = 1 star (pretty much non-existant)\nDessert=1 star (for not ever bringing me a dessert menu)\nWhich averages out to 2 stars."

When I had called, they had asked if we were there for a special occasion and I had mentioned that we were there for a birthday.However, once we got there, they made no mention of it. It wouldn't have been a big deal but everyone else on yelp had their birthday person recognized.   Why ask and then not follow through? Not cool. Not cool at all. \n\nService is outstanding! We started off with the amuse bouche, which consisted of a cauliflower mousse. Absolutely delicious. The servers kept coming back and forth to make sure we had enough bread and water. Kept cleaning our table over and over. They had this little bread crumb lifter that removed all the crumbs. That's high class! Their waitstaff is awesome and for that alone I would say go. \n\nMy mom got the recommended parmesean crusted  chicken while I got the lamb burger. She liked the chicken but it was a little to heavy for me. I got the lamb burger, but it was a little too strong for me, so I'd have to pass. We both ordered a non-alcoholic lime drink which was tasty and a great alternative to the alky. \nWe ended up getting our own dessert, the strawberry souffle with pistachios. Kind of reminded us of strawberry ice cream since they freeze it, but a nice option to the end of the meal. \n\nWould I go again? I don't know. I usually go to Vegas for celebrations, either birthdays or graduations and such, so we usually go all out. But not remembering a birthday of a guest is a big no-no, especially at a place that has such a high level of service. Joel Robuchon definitely remembered. At least I took her to go see O."

I do understand how the size of the filet is a bit small however, it's well worth it, as it's quality over quantity here. You do have a choice of sides which allows you to try even more of their delicious menu. I do not remember our waiter's name that night (May 11), but the service was impeccable from the moment we walked in. The view of the Bellagio fountains definitely adds to the ambiance of this restaurant. It was definitely money well spent.\n\nMy boyfriend and I enjoyed our experience so much, we returned to the restaurant on May 18th. Unfortunately, there was a wait for a table, but we were excited that we could sit at the bar and eat without a wait. Keith/Cory H. served us our food and drinks... and suggested the amazing Eiffel Tower Souffl\u00e9.

It's a lovely restaurant with a beautiful view of the Bellagio and it's dancing fountains.  We each ordered a steak and sides and a drink and relaxed.  \n\nWe were chatting so much that we were shocked to realize that it was already 6:30 and we hadn't seen or heard from our waiter in an hour.  Granted, we were busy conversing, but it seemed odd.  We asked another waiter to track down ours and 15 minutes later our waiter approached explaining that he had somehow forgotten to put our order in.  We were disappointed but understood...we asked if we should bother to have them put in the order...could we make it to the show in time?  We were assured that we could so we sat back and relaxed again...until 30 minutes later when our waiter told us that there was a problem in the kitchen and they had JUST started on our order.  We panicked.  A manager came and assured us that the meal was on the house and that we could still have time to eat.  Meanwhile I asked for a refill (which NEVER came) and when our food came we scarfed it down (so sad because it was good) and ran off as fast as we could to our show.\n\nI don't know what happened with us...it certainly cannot be the norm for this restaurant or else they wouldn't still be in business, so I hate to judge them too harshly.  They did take care of us and the waiter admitted his mistake.  It was just a little frustrating...a romantic, relaxed night out turned little stressful.\n\nWhen I am in Vegas next I would like to try them again."

The sea bass was okay with a nice crisp on the skin but expected more flavor and a thicker cut ( I had better at a small hole in the wall in San Clemente, CA); the asparagus was too al dente and drenched in way too much butter for my liking (and I love butter); the mushroom side was sad and I haven't had a mushroom dish I never liked until now.\n\nThat being said, I did appreciate our attentive server and the experience of fine dining.

Was very delicious, I took the servers suggestion and got it done medium rare, would have liked it a little less pink, but they know best so I went with it. Fiance got veal medallions which were great. We shared two types of potatoes which were both great. We also got the chocolate souffl\u00e9 which was amazing as well. Servers were attentive and pleasant. We had a table with a prime view of bellagio fountains."

            "review": "\"Spring\" Restaurant Week 2013 finally gave me the opportunity to check out le faux Tour Eiffel. In my OpenTable reservation, I mentioned RW and the fact that I would like a seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains.\n\nSilly me. The fountains don't start up until 3pm. We did get our window seat, at least. Though I didn't check out the other side, I'm happy our table was along the window angled toward Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and the Paris balloon. The view was so enjoyable, we didn't miss the fountains at all.\n\nI suppose I should talk about the food. In a word, it was outstanding. They started us out with the amuse-bouche of the day. It was some sort of sunchoke mousse and it certainly amused my bouche. But the star of the meal for me was the beet salad. Easily the best beet salad I've ever had, the RW menu description reads, \"Spring Greens, Smoked Candy Striped, Red And Golden Beets, Fromage Blanc.\" D\u00e9licieux!\n\nNot wanting to turn this into a novel, the main course (\"Sauteed Veal Medallion, Green Pea Mousseline, Wild Forest Mushrooms\") and dessert (\"Mixed Berry Pudding, Strawberry, Blueberry, Raspberry, Framboise, Creme Fraiche\") were also fantastic. Wait a second. Framboise means raspberry. Redundant!\n\nThe wonderful setting and the fabulous food would be diminished if the service wasn't also impeccable. Our waiter knew we were there for RW and he was very knowledgeable about our meal. I chose to do the $16 wine pairing and I enjoyed his tidbit about Willamette Valley being the same latitude as the best pinot regions in France. Sure made that glass of vin taste just that much better. It was also a nice finishing touch as he brought out a selection of chocolates and candy. My choice of passion fruit jelly was delectable.\n\nHaving been to la vraie Tour Eiffel, I've been skeptical about visiting the Vegas version. But this restaurant, with its romantic window tables, has made me a believer. I look forward to returning for dinner with the Bellagio fountains in full force."

He wasn't pushy with menu items, made great suggestions, never rushed us, brought our food out perfectly without crowding the table and his timing was impeccable as he was there to snap our pictures during the fountain light show! I loved that!! We have the fountain as the background in our pix! Yippee!!! \n\nEverything was awesome here, we'll definitely be back!

Sarah had made the reservations a few weeks prior for I believe around 5:30ish, well since the sun had been going down earlier here in Las Vegas, the restaurant contacted us and asked if we would like to move our reservation up to 4:30 that way we can enjoy the sunset while we were enjoying dinner.  SERIOUSLY?! WOW!!!  I felt that was one of the best things a restaurant could even consider, I have never had anyone worry that we might miss the sunset, we were extremely happy and took the 4:30 reservation.  The wine was excellent, the appetizers were amazing, the salmon was delicious, the service was the best I had ever experienced on the strip!  \n\nEven the fellow patrons were a delight, minus the woman sitting next to me yelling at her child because she herself did not know how to operate a digital camera and was trying to take a photo of the sunsetting but was too daft as to turn the flash off, she then complained that the rather clean window was disgustingly dirty and that is why she could not get a good pic, um, no it is because you have your flash on and are trying to take a photo in front of a window LOL But I am not faulting anyone for her stupidity. \n\nThe only issue I have is they have a rather \"strict\" dress code, which i am fine, I just decided to wear my tux as we were going out afterwards and it is always nice to dress up, we were both informed that it is \"Business Attire\" fine, spectacular, and as we are leaving we share an elevator with people carrying To - Go containers while dressed in kind of filthy blue jeans and long sleeved t-shrits.  Why put on your website and inform us over the phone that it is \"Business Attire\" only if you are allowing people to eat there in jeans? \n\nOver all it was an amazing experience, i would definitely recommend eating while the sun is setting as well!!"

We asked her to clarify and again she was adamant that she will have to ask us to move even though we were situated. After verifying that we understood correctly that she wanted us to move for no apparent reason, we decided to leave since it was getting ridiculous.

Now I completely understand they are busy and they cannot possibly guarantee all the requests that come in, but I am sure there is a more tactful way to say it. However, once we got there she absolutely remembered my date from the phone and we got the best table on the window overlooking the fountains. The food was beyond the best of our honeymoon. I asked if they could cook my duck medium instead of medium rare and the waiter said he would have to check with the chef. This always makes me laugh because I think, wait I am paying you, but they said they would accommodate me, and of course it came out medium rare as they said they would serve it on the menu. However, this was a learning experience for me because the duck was seriously the best duck I have ever eaten and I now order my duck as they suggest it because of this restaurant.

I will say there is no real comparison between the two so I will do my best to rate this place solely on my experiences there and not my experiences at the other place.  That being said, here it goes! First, it's expensive and you really don't get what you pay for. It's very noisy inside and I couldn't hear my party of 8 over the buzz of other restaurant goers. The food was mediocre for the price. It felt (and tasted) as if things were reheated in a microwave instead of prepared fresh. The presentation of the food was lacking as well (instead of bringing out a little Happy Birthday dessert for me, they accidentally brought out a Happy Anniversary dessert. Luckily they caught it before I sunk my fork into it, but it kind of grosses me out that they may have given my birthday treat to someone else first). Finally, my party and I felt like the wait staff was rushing us through our meal to get us out the door.  I will say the view of the strip was simply beautiful, though.  Would I go back?

On the reservation, I noted it was her birthday and we ended up with a window seat right in front of the Bellagio fountains. That is absolutely the best view of the fountains I have ever seen. I think almost every staff member came by and wished her a happy birthday. \n\nThe meal options at this place are limited, but I do recommend the steak over the chicken. My wife was eating my steak instead of the chicken she ordered because it tasted that much better. One thing that I was a little confused about at first was before we even ordered our main course, they were asking if we wanted a souffle for dessert. I guess it is because it takes so long to prepare and is made from scratch/to order. I do recommend the souffle for dessert, it tasted delicious!\n\nAs a side note, I recommend buying the tickets for the viewing deck for after your meal. The restaurant offers a slight discount since your are dining there. Overall, will definitely be returning to this restaurant in the future (but only for special occasions, $$$$)."

I took my GF to dinner here shortly after we first met and asked for one of the tables by the window, which offered us stunning 180-degree views of the Bellagio fountains that made us both swoon.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the Paris Hotel's scaled down Eiffel Tower of course and is serviced by a single elevator, which sort of adds some fun and a sense of exclusivity to your evening.  The dining room is intimate, with both booths and floating tables scattered around.  Everything is about the views here, so almost every table has a least a peek of the fountains.  However, there is this odd waiter's station in one corner that I was seated by when I treated my family to dinner on another visit that completely blocked our table's view, which was a bit of a let down.  Steer away from that area if possible.\n\nThe cuisine here is French of course, and while it is certainly well prepared, nothing really ever stands out for me.  This is usually the case with themed or view restaurants;  They live in their own niche and therefore don't really have to compete with others in their category.  Thus, in terms of food there are certainly more impressive restaurants in the area, but they don't have these views.  Note that I'm not knocking the food here;  Just don't expect it to be an epic Michelin 3 diamond experience and you'll be fine.\n\nThe service has been top notch each and every time I've eaten here, although the kitchen is a little less accommodating.  Last visit my old-school father wanted a baked potato with his entree, but the chef flatly refused the request (even though there were obviously potatoes in the house).  My parental unit was about to do the diner scene from Five Easy Pieces on them, but the waiter was very professional and calmed him down, talking him into another one of the sides on the menu, thank God.\n\nReservations are an absolute must and sometimes they'll ask for a credit card and bill you a non-refundable fee ($50, if memory serves, which is applied to your check) to place it.  I've noticed a few other places do this as well;   I guess it stops people from scatter bombing reservations at a bunch of places for the same evening and then cancelling last minute once they make their choice.\n\nIf you just want to come up and take a peek, they do have a bar, but it's been totally packed every time I've been here.  I don't know if they do the velvet rope thing or not to limit the crowds, but expect to wait for a bar seat if you decide to make the trip.\n\nLong and short:  A four star French restaurant with five star views. Definitely one of those places you must try at least once.  Perfect for a special night out, a proposal, or an anniversary.  Highly recommended.  \n\nBon App\u00e9tit!"

            "review": "This was a very disappointing experience after I had wanted to visit here for many years. This visit was in July, 2015. My mom, son, and I visited for lunch around 1pm. It was moderately crowded but we got seated promptly. None of the staff smiled at us and they acted very stuck up. We were dressed up and they were still looking down their noses at us as if we were paupers off the street. How did they know whether or not we had thousands in our wallets ready to spend?!!! It took over 20 minutes just to get a server to take our drink order. He was too busy chatting up/schmoozing the large family seated by the window a few feet away from us to even acknowledge our presence. I don't remember his name but he had short blond hair, glasses, and was over 40. He had a very rude attitude and fake French accent. We should have left as this visit was going downhill fast, but we were hungry so ordered lunch anyway which took a long time to receive. My son and I got the onion soup gratinee which we thought would be French onion soup but ended up being a creamy soup very similar to lobster bisque. The food was very good (yet very pricey) but due to the sub-par treatment and service we received the food was not worth this visit. I was shocked at my experience because a few years ago a very friendly concierge gave us a tour of this place and some free, fresh bread from the oven. We had wanted to visit ever since. She would really be as surprised as we were at the crappy treatment we received years later upon our visit! What a disgrace to the Paris in general!"

I'll give the good and the bad to provide a fair review and why I would not return unfortunately.\n\nMy group and I dressed up quite nice for this place and headed over on time,  as in we were 10 minutes early just in case.  They suggested this as well. \n\nI called ahead like I had read others do to make a request to get a window seat and the service I got on the phone had been fine. The woman made it sound like it would be easily accommodated and I believed her considering I called a whole week ahead.  She told me when I arrived speak to the front to confirm and so I did. I was greeted with a very monotone blank reply of \"unfortunately that is usually kept for 2 people so if you'd like to sit we'll call you when you're ready\". A little peek into the future all I saw were groups of four... But the reply I got was what I did not approve. No considerate explanation she just brushed it off and said sit down in a rude tone. And no eye contact? That's always a sure sign you're getting great service....\n\nThe window seat wasn't the biggest deal but we got a far seat with an overly excited group of women banging their table, laughing excessively loud and using flash photography throughout their meal. Or how about the table in front of us that was glued to their phones and since I was on an elevated platform all I saw in front of me was women editing selfies and checking how many people viewed their snapchat. The reviews who say it was classy make me think they had a better experience than I.  This place is more what you'd call \"Vegas classy\" because had I been in SF these types of parties would have been asked to calm down and remove their devices from the tables. \n\nI give it 3 stars for the entire experience. For goodness sakes, they called me the wrong name when bringing us to the table. Not even an attempt to ask how to say my name, just a really butchered wrong name.  And most of you know the ability to say one's name makes the entire experience more personal. Then we were lead to our table that was placed for 3 instead of four so they made us go back to the lounge once again and wait another 10 minutes. That's not a fine dining experience to me unfortunately.  You've had my reservation for weeks and we get there early make us wait in a tightly packed waiting area and then get it wrong? Maybe in a casual restaurant that'd be fine, but if you tout about being the best you damn well better live up to it. A butchered name and an additional wait because they screwed up? Not living up to the expectation. \n\nFor those above reasons I gave it a 3 because it was genuinely just a-ok. \n\nNow the food and service we got was good. Rebecca our server was wonderful and knew her information, which I highly respected as some of my friends didn't know certain parts of their meals. \n\nThe filet mignon and the rack of lamb were great, although I will say this. One of my party's steaks was a very easily rare when he had asked for medium rare. I truly believe you can tell how great a place is by the ability to cook the steaks perfectly and he had an extremely rare steak. Not a medium rare, a bloody-raw-middle rare looking steak. That wasn't okay. \n\nWe ordered a souffle which was wonderful and came out on time since we had ordered ahead. It had risen nicely and the texture was soft while the flavor was light with a nice touch of the Nutella flavor.  That was probably the nicest part of the meal. \n\nIt wasn't the worst experience and I'm no fine dining expertise, but I have certainly had my fair share of classy restaurants in LA, SF, NYC, and DC and this just didn't seem to be on par. Part of it is some of the clientele you get. They bloody tell you business casual with jacket preferred after 4 but I see a man in a opened plaid button down with jeans on? \n\nYou have a mixture of fine diners and people who look like they're going to clubs. And then you get people who are overly obnoxious at their tables without respect for others because it's Las Vegas and not some real nice restaurant in some upscale neighborhood of a metropolitan city. My friend accidentally bumped into a woman and she was so offended she had to turn around and make a nasty comment? Such a classy experience! Not to exclude the fact that he apologized profusely and was trying to make room for someone else to walk? \n\nA mixture of good and bad service, coupled with decent food and a bad seating placement make me go with a 3 star experience. I didn't leave this establishment thinking \"wow that was the most amazing meal I've had\" I left thinking it was okay. I paid four hundred dollars for a incorrectly cooked steak, a wrong use of my name, obnoxious clients around us and the errors made initially and with that I probably will not return to this establishment and will look elsewhere for a better fine dining restaurant."

It was an amazing view. The service was also well above average. Our waiter was great. \n\nAs for the food, we got a complimentary flan+braised duck appetizer which was interestingly good. I ordered the roasted pear salad and my wide got the creamy lentil soup. Both were very very good. For our main course we got braised short ribs and beef Wellington. Also some potatoes gratin and their asperigus dish. Each of these were AMAZING. The asparigus was so crisp and fresh, and the potatoes were so creamy and good. The beef dishes were cooked perfectly. We also had some really good wine and champagne.  \n\nAt the end, we got a complementary shot glass sized chocolate moose and cream dessert. We also ordered an apple strudel and cinnamon ice cream dessert which was really good. \n\nI have to say, this place was amazing. I'd go back in a heartbeat....though it also might have been one of the most expensive meals i've has too. It was worth it though."

I was so excited for this place and thought we would have a quiet, romantic meal looking over the strip.  \n\nWe know it was going to be expensive so the sticker shock wasn't as bad for us.  We each ordered a main dish, a side, and 1 drink.  This was about $75 each person.  We passed on sweets because we were both full.  \n\nThe food was really good and my wine was delicious. The view was good.  We were sitting to the side against the window so had great views.  \n\nMy biggest complaint was that the tables were small.  I felt very cramped.  When I went to stand up I felt that I was hitting everything/anybody around me.  I also felt like I was sitting on top of the person at the table next to me.  I know they do this to maximize guests who can be there at the same time but I felt it took away from the ambiance of the restaurant/experience."

He was told that they can't guarantee that and we'll just have to basically try our luck when we get there. We were so happy to find out that they have reserved a table for us by the corner (closest to the Paris balloon) with the view of the fountains! :) It was nice being in the corner, we had a little bit pf privacy. The setting was so romantic, especially with the view of the sun setting and the Bellagio fountains dancing.\n\nWe sat down and started going through the food menu and the wine list. It was so hard picking out the wine since they had a massive list. My husband and I ended up getting 2 different ones. A glass of ros\u00e9 wine for me and a half bottle of red wine for him (can't remember exactly what the varieties were). For our starters, I got the corn soup and my husband got the smoked salmon. We got the muscovy duck and the aged new york steak for our main course. Then we got two souffl\u00e9s to mix and share, as per our server's suggestion. We had the grand marnier and chocolate-- they were to die for! Everything we had turned out to be very, very good!\n\nAlso our server, Joshua (I hope I got his name right), was wonderful! Even after devouring our desserts, he even offered us some petit fours. Wish I could take all of their salted caramels! lol They were so good... best I ever had so far.\n\nWe were very satisfied with everything and left the restaurant with very happy tummies! We'll definitely go back again in the future! :)"

Construction is going on between the Bellagio and Monte Carlo, and so cranes are also in the picture.\n\nThe service is IMPECCABLE. Everything was on perfect cue. We did not have to verbalize additional requests. With subtle eye contact and body language, the waiter decanted additional wine and flawlessly poured the wine in the polished wine glasses. He removed the plates in a timely and quiet manner. The highlight was the complimentary dessert tray. My favorite was the grape jelly coated in sugar crystals.\n\nOh, the food? It was alright. The foie gras slice was a fairly generous amount. In its rarity, I had farm-raised sturgeon, which I thought could have been warmer than lukewarm.\n\nWhat really ticked me off was the bathroom attendant who twisted my and my friends' arms for $5 gratuity for a mere three individually wrapped lifesaver breath mints.

More than to be expected.  \n\nThe food was pretty damn good too.  We ordered a bottle of champagne, and they started us with a little amuse bouche of Parmesan flan, which was quite tasty, and some cheese puffs.

Here's where the meal gets fun.  His entree was the Omelet Souffle and mine was the Baked Crepes.  The waiter wanted to make sure we weren't in a hurry since the Omelet Souffle takes about twenty minutes to fire after our appetizers.  We were fine with that.\n\nSo after our appetizers were finished we waited and waited for our meal and nothing showed up.  Finally he decided to go the restroom and the manager shows up to tell us there was some sort of mistake and our order got lost.  That's fine, we can wait, we really had nothing else going on that day.  So they left to make sure it started and after the bf came back, I suggested he try to get some free drinks out of it while I ran to the restroom.  \n\nI came back and there were two glasses of champagne!

That was my first time tasting bone marrow... ehh. Not really my cup of tea, but it wasn't bad, I'll give you that. We got an order of mac-n-cheese to share. Mmmm! Perfect amount of cheese, a bit too filling, but then again, we DID order a good amount of delicious food. \n\nWe shared with our waiter that we were celebrating our anniversary. To our surprise, he brought out two chocolate mousse for our anni. He said, \"In France, it is tradition to eat this with your significant other on your anniversary.\" How sweet! On top of that, he talked us into trying one of their succulent souffles. I ordered creme brulee because my boyfriend can't resist creme brulee! Alll were soooo sooo BOMB!

The staff is very friendly and helpful and our waitress was fantastic. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, honest in her recommendations and did her best to meet some of our more food restrictive diners.\nOur table had an excellent view of the Bellagio Fountains which made every 15 minutes a treat.\n\nWe started with a fennel parfait compliments of the chef.  For an appetizer we shared a seafood treasure chest of lobster, crab leg, oysters, shrimp and a seafood salad.  For an appetizer, a single order of the seafood appetizer will be enough for two to share.\n\nFor dinner I enjoyed the beef wellington, light and flaky with an earthy mushroom flavor and beautifully cooked so it cut like butter and melted in your mouth.\n\nWe also tried the Rabbit which was surprisingly tasty, flaky but moist.\nThe crab salad was also well presented.\n\nThe restaurant was able to accomodate the special requests for a picky eater in our company who has several allergies.  When they couldn't, they were quick to inform her of the reason and other options.\n\nI have to say I was very disappointed in the kids menu.  Although reasonably priced and with crayons and a kids coloring menu, the options were pasta with butter or marinara, grilled cheese and chicken.  I mean this is a beautiful, top food restaurant and you can't get more creative on your kids menu?  So many restaurants sell the kids tastes short but I would have gladly paid an extra couple of dollars for her to be able to add shrimp or chicken to her pasta, or have a fish option.\n\nOther than the kids menu, it was a fantastic dining experience.\nNOTE: This is one of those places where you pay more for the location and view so the prices will be high.  It is also one of those places where it is worth the price.\n\nNOTE 2: Although I was there with my family, this would be a very romantic date spot."

We made our reservations for dinner early while we strolled through the casino. The woman made it very clear that there was a dress code. We arrived for dinner 30 minutes before our reservation but were seated anyways. I couldn't believe the view its breath taking. Between all the Vegas lights and the Bellagio fountain show about every half hour I was mesmerized. When the menu came I was very intimidated and surprised at how small it was. The prices were very up there. This is the most expensive restaurant I have ever been to in my whole entire life I'm not much of a food critic. I ordered the filet mignon in the b\u00e9arnaise sauce with the spinach and mushroom, the waiter did an excellent job answering my questions and helping me choose a wine. My boyfriend ordered the flatiron steak. We received an asparagus mousse compliments of the chef which I thought was very sweet I'm not sure if they do this for everyone. The food is a decent amount and all of it was delicious nothing out of this world though. I recommend it for a romantic intimate dinner a man even proposed to his wife while we were there (she said yes) it really was one of the most amazing views. The check came out to about $200 including tip. For the money I feel like we could've gone to another swanky Vegas restaurant and gotten a better dinner but it's just one of those things you have to experience. I was scared of a snotty establishment but the staff were all sweet and helpful."

The view of the Bellagio water fountains (at night) was amazing!  \n\nThis is a class establishment with a focus on service and it starts before you ever get on the elevator to the restaurant.  There is a gentleman on the first floor who helps you into the elevator and a gentleman that greets you as you exit the elevator to take you to the hostess.  The elevator opens into the kitchen so you get to see the staff working diligently to bring the food to the patrons' tables.\n\nI was fortunate that one of the people I dined with was French and a wine aficionado; everyone agreed that the French wine he chose was an excellent selection.  As a starter, I had the butternut squash soup with double smoked bacon.  I played it safe with the entree; I chose the pheasant and wild berry risotto and green beans almondine.    Everything was outstanding including the wonderful breads that we were provided while waiting for our meal.  I topped off dinner with a caramel souffle... it was heaven in a cup. \n\nThe portions were appropriately sized for a French restaurant.  I left the restaurant very satisfied and very happy that I was invited.  It was truly a nice experience.  This restaurant would be a very nice place to bring a date for a romantic dinner.  I also believe that the prices were appropriate for the level of service and quality of food.  I look forward to eating here again next time I'm in Vegas."

            "review": "Excellent but accessible French food can be difficult to find.  The best places are often mired in complex and difficult to decipher menu description and/or ruined by stuffy service.  The more accessible places can easily dumb down the food resulting in bland food covered by thick, heavy sauces. \n\nThe Eiffel Tower restaurant strikes a remarkable and enjoyable balance by preparing many traditional french dishes, but explaining them in an enjoyably simple - but not dumbed down - manner and avoiding too many exotic ingredients that would turn off the average diner (escargot are not in every dish...). \n\nAs what may be an \"above average\" diner though, the menu, food, service, and atmosphere were all excellent.  It was a special occasion meal for us, being the anniversary of our engagement under the Eiffel Tower (the real one in Paris) while we were on our honeymoon.  My new bride was a little wary of going to an all-French restaurant, but found plenty to choose from.  All our food was excellent, from start to finish.  The sauces were rich and silky, but never heavy and smothering.   \n\nService was excellent, with the entire staff from the elevator operators to the busboys providing elegant, dignified service.  As for atmosphere, it is a dark, classy restaurant with small white linen-covered tables. The view can be amazing - it is right across from the Bellagio hotel and resort and has a front row view of the fountain shows. \n\nNot a cheap place for dinner, but highly recommended for a special occasion event."

First off, you're going to pay to play here; though the prices are *reasonable* for this level of dining in Vegas (it's not Michelin rated or anything), it's still not easy on the budget.  The service and the venue are absolutely 5 stars.  The food was phenomenal as well, but nothing miraculous.  I am going to complain about the wine prices.  The glasses and bottles here are WAY overpriced, even for a place like this; with a corkage fee to match.  \n\nIf you're a regular Vegas goer, then this needs to be on your list.  It's up there with the Picasso or Michael Mina (my two favorites)."

            "review": "This review is for our lunch experience on a Sunday.  I can't speak to the dinner service, but if it's anything like lunch, then you're in for a treat.\n\nTo start, we didn't have reservations, but it was a Sunday and we decided to take our chances.  Thank god we did, because we were quickly seated at a table with a gorgeous view of the strip including the Bellagio fountains.  \n\nThen came Todd Smith.  Oh Todd, I would marry you if I could, but I don't think my husband would appreciate it.  On second thought, he probably wouldn't mind because Todd was amazing.  The right amount of service, charm, and all the right suggestions.\n\nFor starters was an amuse bouche of what I think was mushroom flan coupled with some cheese gougeres, better known as fancy french cheese puffs.  They were both delicious.  I was pretty close to asking for a few more puffs, but then out came our lunches.\n\nI had their version of a caprese salad, served with heirloom tomatoes, fresh mozarella, and basil infused water.  I know, basil water? Initally, I thought it was a whole cup of dressing, but I was corrected, and he poured away. Delicious.  Refreshing and light with just the right amount of basil.  I'd order that again.\n\nMy hb had the lamb burger.  I was hesitant at first because while I love lamb, it can easily be ruined. This burger, oh this burger, was just so good.  It had a slight taste of curry, and a bit of a spice kick.  Cooked to a medium perfection, and served with a roasted red pepper relish.  I would definitely order that again.\n\nWe finished off brunch with the stuffed french toast.  When we ordered this, I thought I would be stuffed myself, but it was a perfect sized portion for the 2 of us.  It wasn't too sweet, which was a pleasant surprise, and was served with the thinnest piece of crispy bacon.  Perfect balance of salty and sweet.\n\nBrunch prices were reasonable and considering we loved everything we had, I'd say it was well worth it.  That, and the service from Todd, the busser, and pretty much all the staff made this a perfect lunch."

I ordered coffee with dessert and had taken out a small amount of the sugar packet to taste.  It wasn't enough but when I went to add more, the packet had already been cleared from the table top without my realizing. \n\nThe mushroom soup was fabulous.  You cannot ruin fois gras and its nice to see it on the menu.  The lamb chops were as tender and tasty as any I've ever had,  while the Wellington wasn't the best I've had it was so nice to see there.  Souffl\u00e9 for dessert, a view of the Bellagio fountains.

            "review": "My wife and I made the trek to Vegas for Memorial Day to celebrate an early anniversary.  Initially we had reserved at Picasso across at the Bellagio, but with the heavy traffic we were forced to find other options.  We've been to Vegas countless times so we finally decided to try the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  I have to say, it exceeded my expectations.  The dining room was a great rendition of those Parisian brasseries.  Although there were a few open seats that faced the window, the hostess could not accommodate us due to prior reservations.  We were pretty hungry so at that point, it wasn't worth the wait.  \n\nAs it turns out, this was a bit of a serendipitous turn as we were waited on by one of the best waiters I've experienced in quite a while in Rodney.  From listening to our tastes, he was able to recommend us two delicious red wines that paired perfectly with the dinner selection that we chose. \n\nBefore we even started, we were served a nice amuse bouche of chilled avocado puree.  It was a nice palate cleanser and a welcome bite after such a long drive in.\n\nWanting to maintain that French theme, we chose the Fricassee of Wild Escargot, Potato, Sweet Garlic Souffle and the Roasted Foie Gras, Rhubarb Compote, Alsace Spice Croutons for appetizers.  Both were quite tasty with a nice balance of flavors.  The Foie Gras had a great compote that offset the richness of the foie gras itself.  Escargot is definitely an acquired taste, but that said, the fricassee was equally delicious over the bed of potato.\n\nIn between, Rodney continually checked on us and talked with us like old friends that haven't seen each other for a long time.  \n\nThe main course itself, we chose the Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras and the Boneless Farm Raised Rabbit, Braised Carrots Confits, Mustard Jus.  Just delicious.  I looked for both of these entrees in Paris last fall and to my surprise, I just had to come to Vegas for some real French food.  The duck was perfectly cooked and the rice had a very pleasant hint of orange folded with it.  The rabbit itself was slightly crispy on the outside and the meat itself was quite tender.  (Those who have never had rabbit before, it tastes like chicken mostly but it does have another unique flavor to it)  In addition we decided to supplement with the potato croquettes and the gratin\u00e9e creamed spinach and mushroom.  (We also learned from one of the French staff that croquettes are not French).  Amazing.  Slightly crispy on the outside and the middle is similar to a mashed potato texture, its something I haven't had before.  The only minus points were the creamed spinach was a little too oily for my liking.\n\nSave room for the souffle.  Its a can't miss.  We chose the pistachio (btw, i love all things pistachio - macaroons, froyo, etc.) but I can imagine the other flavors being just as good.  The dessert itself is quite light and the souffle itself has a texture similar to sponge cake.\n\nAfterwards, Rodney surprised us with a plate commemorating our 2nd anniversary with a chocolate mousse in the center.  At that point, I was quite full, but i did manage to get a small taste of it.  As with the rest of the meal, delicious.\n\nIn closing, as someone who visits Vegas on a consistent basis, I look forward to celebrating our future events at the Eiffel Tower restaurant and would recommend others as well to experience the authentic French food and delicious desserts."

We were in a hurry because we had to go to see the show Zarkana and we were hoping to go upstairs to see the view from the top after dinner. Even though the restaurant was pretty empty because it was about 5 o'clock, we were still asked to wait until our reservation at 5:15, which was fine but annoying because it was empty. \nWe got seated and the waitress came around and we were escorted to our seats, which overlooked the bellagio fountain. We were given our choice of bread, which was delicious and a sample of soup. That was nice too. \nWhen we were looking at the menu, there was something I had a question about. When I asked, she talked to me like I was a moron. Lady, I'm in pharmacy school NOT a 2 year old. That kind of annoyed me. Anyways we ordered our food and that was delicious. My friend got the veal medallions and I can't remember the name of what I got. they were both great though! \n I felt like the man who was offering bread checked back with us about the food more often than the waitress did. Anyways we had told her in the beginning that we were pressed for time and we told her we didn't want dessert and requested the check. She brought over the check and told us to enjoy the show. We had about 20 minutes to spare before we would have to head over to the show and thought we would be able to make it to the roof top, BUT she didn't even come back after we waited around for 10 minutes. We asked the man that was serving the bread to get her and finally we could leave. Unfortunately it was too late and we couldn't go to the top. It was pretty annoying, if she knew we are pressed for time then she should have grabbed the checkbook from us right away. \n\nBottom line: Food = excellent, waitstaff = ehh not my fave."

I tried about 4 different types of breads and they were all really good.  I can't think of the french term for the item they bring to start off your meal...whatever it's called, really really good.  It was a a califlower puree.  We all enjoyed it, along with the raw beef appetizer which was very flavorful.\n\nEveryone at my table had a different entree. I can't remember what everyone had right now...I know I had the duck, someone had chicken, someone had beef, someone had fish...everyone loved their food!\n\nA couple of people had mixed drinks...can't remember what they were.  But they liked them.  I along with my parents had red wine. Very pleased.\n\nFrom the very beginning, our waiter explained to us that they are knonw for their souffle and if we wanted it, we needed to order it right away because it took a long while to make.  So my dad, sister and I went ahead and ordered the souffle. My dad and I had the chocolate souffle...my sister had the banana souffle I think.  We all enjoyed it but it wasn't ALL THAT to us.  Also, the menu said it was $8 but we were actually charged $15 per souffle.  We didn't understand why and were too lazy to inquire.\n\nThe view...I think from most/all tables in the restaurant you have a direct view of Bellagio's fountains.  It was lovely being able to watch the water show while enjoying our meal.\n\nThis place is the ultimate for a romantic dinner.  I noticed there were tons of 2 seater tables right at the window.  Which is cool, especially for their special sunset dinner they have.  \n\nOn the flip side of that, I did see a lot of larger groups there, like my family.  I think because it was Christmas night, there were a lot of families like us, having their Christmas dinner there.  Great choice.  We were all very pleased.\n\nThis was one of the most enjoyable meal experiences I've had while in Vegas.  I highly recommend it!"

Since we were early they showed us to our table early and we got started. We were sat by Angel, she was very nice. (I have to mention that all of the hosts were dressed beautifully & all of them were very nice!) Maria, our server, shotly came over & got us started with drinks, explained the menu to us & got the show on the road! The start by brining you soup that cleanses your pallet. Then we started with the seafood platter & they brought over the best fresh bread! My husband ordered the salmon and I ordered the Queen filet mignon we didn't decide to get any sides because we had already ordered so much food. (Keep in mind all of the menu items come ala carte.) Our dinner got to our table and we were both blown away! It was amazing! Cooked to perfection & seasoned perfectly. The flavored were incredible! We get through dinner & I ordered the cr\u00e9me brulee . First Maria came out & wished me a happy birthday & brought a beautiful plate from the chef that said happy birthday along with my cr\u00e9me brulee. They were both so delicious! Lastly Maria brought us over an array of fresh made candies & seriously they were the best candies I've ever had in my life! It was such a beautiful dinner.

Maybe go for dessert and wine?"

He called to reserve an 8:00 dinner at which he was specifically asked whether he was celebrating a particular occasion; during which he stated, \"Our anniversary\".  At check-in, we were greeted with, \"Happy Anniversary\".\n\nWe arrived and were seated at a window table for two with a spectacular view of the Strip and Bellagio Fountains' water show.  While watching the water show, I ordered a Cosmopolitan, Spring Water, and Non-Traditional Caesar Salad with Anchovies, Capers, and Garlic.  We were also given a choice of three breads: Sourdough, French Baguette, or Whole Wheat.  We both selected the Sourdough and French Baguette, and were pleased.  \n\nFor the entrees, he ordered the Char-Broiled Filet Mignon (prepared Medium Rare), Rossini Style, with Foie Gras and Truffle Sauce - it was absolutely delicious.  I originally ordered the Beef Wellington, but we were pressed for time (for our 9:30 Zumanity show at New York-New York) after our waiter indicated it could take in excess of 45 minutes to cook, so I subsequently ordered the Roasted Rack of Lamb (prepared Medium) with Tomato Tart and Tarragon Jus - it too was delicious.  \n\nAfter dinner, I finished the Cosmopolitan - it was one of the best Cosmos I have ever experienced.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\nOur waiter attempted up-sell at every moment.  While deciding on our dinner selections, we asked him about an appetizer, he suggested the highest priced appetizer.  When we asked him about soup or salad, he suggested one of the highest priced items, and when we inquired about the entrees, he, of course, suggested the highest priced entree.\n\nAs we were celebrating our anniversary, our waiter never once mentioned it.  We never received an \"Anniversary\" dessert or anything close to it.  Although we were slightly pressed for time, our waiter did not even suggest a to-go dessert.  \n\n\nThe Ugly\n\nWe received absolutely nothing for deciding to celebrate our anniversary at Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  We would have gladly paid more than our $200 bill to have received much better service."

Mushroom quesadilla was so so good and filling!\n\nMy husband had a filet and said it was excellent! Cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n\nI'll post a pic of the seating, we sat window side facing the Bellagio and it was so neat to see the fountains at night, from this perspective. They fountains go ever 20 minutes I believe and at one point we called our children who were placed on no volume and whispered to them what they were about to see. (Didn't want to disrupt anyone's dining experience) Our sons thought it was pretty cool!\n\nThe wait staff really takes part in making sure you have an excellent dining experience.

It was so light and refreshing.  \nWe both started with the French Onion soup.  Now, I have had A LOT of French Onion soup in Paris (some good and some bad), and I make a mean version myself.  This was by far the most unique version I have ever had.  It was creamy.  There was no heavy cover of cheese, and there was not an actual onion in sight. BUT, amazingly, they captured the flavor of French Onion Soup.  It was accompanied by a parmesan crisp.  I really, really enjoyed it.\nI had an endive and goat cheese salad which was light and refreshing.  My husband ordered the French BLT tower, and it was more food than he could finish.  Also, very good. \nWe skipped dessert since we were headed to the MGM pool for the afternoon.\nThe service as polite, but  little bumpy.

It was rich, bittersweet and very satisfying for its small size. One of the best I've ever had. Nice touch! \n\nIt was a very nice experience, especially watching the beauriful fountains while we enjoyed our meal.

It's really not that high up, so I wasn't incredibly impressed by the view people keep yapping about.  If you want an amazing view, I suggest the Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere instead.  For ambiance, I'd give it 4 stars.  It was nice although sound from other tables really carries well.  \n\nLet's talk about the food since that's the most important part about the experience.  Ok, for a place this expensive, I don't expect good.  I expect damn good.  And damn, it wasn't good.  For bread, it was typical crusty baguette, multigrain, or sourdough.  Nothing to write home about.  To start off, the menu had enough choices, but we didn't see anything that really stuck out.  Yes it's a fancy French restaurant, so I expected to not know what half the words meant, but come on, you don't have to make the menu sound so pretentious!  Anyway, as an appetizer ($20), the escargot was quite nice, better than Mon Ami Gabi downstairs and was much better than either of our entrees: Wild Red Snapper & Duck 2 Ways.  My fish was light and delicate, cooked in grapeseed oil.  It was served over really buttery swiss chard, onions, and broccolini.  For $40, I expected my taste buds to be dancing and begging for more.  They weren't.  My sister's $40 duck was (as the named implied) cooked 2 ways...confit (fancy way of saying fried) and roasted to a medium rare.  The confit lacked favor and moisture.  It was definitely over cooked.  I prefer the duck hanging in the windows of Chinatown hole in the walls over this any day.  The roasted duck was better...although a little too rare for my taste.  It was served over a mix of wild rice, braised turnip and other fancy stuff I can't pronounce.  It tasted fine but again I wasn't jumping up and down.  We also ordered  a side of the sauteed wild mushrooms, which were yummy.  But not worth 9 bucks.  We skipped dessert because nothing sounded that appealing.  \n\nService was your typical upscale restaurant service...nice, prompt, but unmemorable.  If I had actually paid for the meal, I would feel totally ripped off.  I've had my fair share of nice fancy restaurants with spectacular views, but this place is needs to work on making it's food more approachable and frankly, good. Overall, I think the place itself is nice...especially for a special outing, but for the food and the price you'd pay for it, go elsewhere."

We had excellent dishes. To my surprise and happiness, they had gluten free cheese poufs instead of a basket of bread. If I could have ordered an entire plate of those, I would!\n\nOn account of the nice time we had there at lunch, we popped up there for dessert late on Tuesday night after a fairly disappointing night. We thought that dessert, drinks and the fountain would perk us back up and make a nice end to our trip. Big mistake. We were dressed for where we had originally planned to go, which meant nice jeans and sweaters. I wear semi-religious clothing and that's OBVIOUS when you look at me. Despite the fact that we did not meet their dress code, we were ushered into the elevator (unaware of the dress code, mind you. We are not regulars and it is not posted.) My partner was instantly pulled aside by the hostess and asked what his jacket size was, etc.\n\nI realize they are a nice restaurant and they want a particular reputation. Damn near ten at night on Tuesday, however, is maybe not the time to enforce it, especially as it was not posted, and the downstairs elevator staff did not warn us. I realize we are not swanky. We probably are not their desired clientele,  but given that we stated we just wanted drinks and dessert, they might have stuffed us in a corner and called it good enough? (For the record, we left -- a jacket over a sweater in a restaurant would have been misery.)\n\nBottom line, they need to post their dress code. And if they insist men wear jackets, then they need to put jackets over girls that are wearing inappropriate outfits too. Otherwise they come across as a badly-disguised meat-market. And maybe, on a weekday night, that's exactly what they are?\n\nI'd still recommend this place for lunch, but I don't think I'll be back because of how badly they handled their own policy."

The flavor just wasn't there and the chorizo was chopped, which is weird. The potatoes it was served with were just OK. The eggs were nicely cooked and the sauce was pretty good. I think the food should warrant 3 stars considering the reputation, and mine was only 2 stars. \n\nOur party of 3 had different opinions of the food. My sister said her club sandwich (with avocado!) was the best ever. I tasted it and it was good. We were there for lunch and entrees are around $20. They also served an amuse bouche of mushroom soup that was excellent as well as french bread. After our meal, our server asked how the food was and I told him my thoughts on the benedict. He said he agreed that it's not the best but can't tell people that. Alrighty then. Our view of the fountains was awesome. The bar is pretty big and is at the center of the restaurant. \nMaybe skip the food and enjoy a martini while the fountains do their thing in the background."

I try to translate expensive things with good quality, but unfortunately that was not the case here. Our party had 7 people total... \n\nGood news first:\n~Beautiful view of the Bellagio water show\n~the Souffles ($10) are yummy (chocolate and grand marnier)\n~escargot appetizer (~$13) - decent size and good\n~foie gras appetizer (~$14)- foie gras was ok, but the fig chutney was delicious\n~stuffed rabbit entree ($45) - my friends 12 year old ordered it and said it tasted like chicken (to him, delicious!)\n\nBad news (here is the list of food ordered and the qualitative comments):\n~grilled asparagus ($9) - DISGUSTING. mushy, STEAMED not grilled, and covered with a HARD BOILED EGG CRUMBLE (WTF?!?!?)\n~potato fritters ($9) - pretty cool concept. they came out looking like mozzarella sticks, but no cheese inside, just mashed potato stuff. first bite was delicious then I quickly realized how ridiculously salty they were, and ate 2 out of a 9 or 10 piece order\n~surf n turf ($50) - the new york strip was the size of a filet mignon without the girth, and the piece of fish was cooked OK but also smaller than a small box of chicken nuggets from McDonalds\n~halibut ($40) - tiny portion but tasted ok\n\nI forgot the other dishes, but to top off the shitty food, our reservation was for 7:30pm and we didnt leave until after 11. almost 4 hours for 3 courses (appetizers, entrees, desserts)? I think that is a bit ridiculous. I have paid much less for much better food. if you have reservations, have some in-n-out first (that is where we ended up afterwards, LOL no joke)\n\nbtw - the bill at the end was $700 - 7 drinks (5 alcohol and 2 non), 2 appetizers, 6 entrees, 2 sides, 3 desserts."

I asked if I could get a vegetarian plate instead of the flat iron steak dinner and the chef happily obliged. Oddly, for me, the things I enjoyed the least were the complimentary mushroom flan (blah, only was to describe it) and the baked puffed dinner roll (lackluster, not a french baked treat I was looking forward to). The appetizer for the menu was a small salad and a nice size portion of spinach strussel. That was very good. My lunch entree (the one the chef made special for me) was crepes stuffed with artichokes and mushrooms and onions with a marinara sauce and basil pesto (?). It was very tasty. The dessert was also very good. I didnt think I would like basil flavored ice cream but it was refreshing and hit the spot after lunch. Overall I enjoyed my meal but I dont think it's a place I would come back to. For what they charge, there are much better places that I'd rather go to."

Me, my husband and 2 other friends were graving for souffle on a Sunday afternoon, so we were thinking we should find a restaurant somewhere in the Paris hotel that had it. We walked by the entrance of the The Eiffel Tower Restaurant and a guy asked us to check out their brunch menu. So we especially asked him if they have dessert souffle and pasta in brunch, then he said \"yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.\" We were all excited to have a good brunch.\n\nWe ordered Eiffel Tower classic hamburger, Light omelette souffle topped w/ asparagus and brie, also some french toasts. When my friend was trying to order pasta, our server was so rude by answering \"Pasta and spaghetti are Italian while this is a French restaurant.\" Then we were thinking why the hack they have hamburger, isn't it Germany cuisine? And then my friend asked him, if we could order dessert souffle, he said they don't have time to prepare for the lunch period. But that's what we've told and that's the main purpose of us decided to come into this restaurant. What can we do? We were disappointed, but we still had to stay. \n\nAppetizer: instead of having regular bread, they served us an amuse bouche of some kind of parfait, it was delicious. \n\nHamburger: it tasted alright but very juicy\n\nOmelette souffle: texture was just like an overcooked steam egg\n\nFrench toasts: it tasted ok\n\nThe price is reasonable, the whole meal costs around $60. I will recommend to go for dinner but not brunch."

She is a lover of French food and is particular about authenticity as she spent some time studying abroad over there.\n\nWe were staying at the Bellagio, across from Paris, which is a short walk using the overpass walkway. I made 7pm reservations for two. When we had arrived, nearly all window seats were taken, but we were able to snag one without wait.\n\nOur orders:\n- Eiffel Affair (drink) $19 - way pricey for what it is. When I see a drink at $20, I expect something spectacular, or at the very least unique. It was cool that this drink had actual berries in it, but was not worth $20.\n- Escargot $20 - this was strictly for my girlfriend. She did comment that it was not like traditional escargot and seemed a bit disappointed with the dish. I ate the poached egg, and it was done correctly (spills everywhere when punctured).\n- Lamb $46 - which was cited as Eiffel Tower Restaurant's best dish by our waiter.. it was amazing. Both tender and flavorful, and I haven't enjoyed lamb the same way since. The serving is generous.\n- Sea Bass $44\n\nThe view was very nice and the service was excellent. Our server was very attentive and not overbearing. He took several pictures for us. Truly a romantic dinner.\n\nIn the end, although I found Eiffel Tower Restaurant very romantic, and food reasonably priced, it sort of bothers me how much their drinks cost here. That, and my girlfriend and I both agreed that although we enjoyed dining at ETR, we probably would try other places before returning. But definitely try this place once for a special night! It certainly has real WOW factor. 4/5 stars.\n\nCheck out my photos for a pic of the $20 drink, escargot, and lamb."

Great spot if you can't make the trek over to Paris and see the real thing.  This is a pretty good way to spend an evening.  Asked for a window table and we got a great one with a view of the Bellagio Fountains and the beautiful floor show every 15 minutes out the window was spectacular.  You should note, that there is a dress code for this place.  Guys have to wear a collared shirt.  I didn't and was handed a white kitchen shirt upon arrival...not my taste.  I did not go in a tank top and shorts either.  I wore a nice pair of slacks, dress shoes and a collarless red v-neck designer shirt that was way nicer than some of the unironed things I saw throughout the evening.  A simple reminder from the hotel would have made that less awkward for an otherwise nice birthday dinner.  A great wine list, but had to ask for it.  Good selection of US and French options.  I chose the French - duh!  But it was really from France, not a mock up.  A most excellent Bordeaux that was perfect with the meal.  The bread is offered per slice and a nice mix of options, but the butter reminded me most of Paris, so that was good on anything they offered.  I chose the Beet Salad for the appetizer.  Also really great.  This looked like it was going to be a four star restaurant on food, but the steak was only so-so.  Cooked good enough, but it was a little bland.  A Morton's or Ruth's Chris steak is sizzling hot when delivered and smothered in butter, but this one, well, cooked decent, but just didn't have the experience of a terrific steak.  I had the red wine sauce as a side, which helped it along.  For dessert, we shared a Caramel Souffle and that was a nice end to the meal.  Very light and airy, and who doesn't like caramel?  The waiter also brought me a mini-Chocolate Mousse which was a bonus.  Plus choice of a small petit-four - I picked the Salted Caramel.  Enjoyed the experience, as it was a fun dinner, but this is a special occasion place.  Save it for that."

Maybe come here on one of your first nights in Las Vegas, especially if you are not staying in or near the Bellagio/Paris (we stayed in the Paris hotel). If you are always around the fountains, they do get old after awhile. But then again, it's a different, more grand vantage point to enjoy them from.\n\nWe didn't take advantage but if you have an early 5:00 pm dinner, they will seat you at a window immediately. This is probably because Las Vegas diners come out pretty late for dinner and dining rooms are pretty empty until 7 p.m. hits.\n\nThe service is not particularly friendly, but I'm never really impressed by overly enthusiastic waiters anyway, so that was fine by me. One exception was the server who came around with bread. He was so enthusiastic about his bread. Lol. Great guy. \n\nMy husband and I both had the filet mignon with truffle sauce. It arrived...warmish, not hot. We had to remind the server we also had the truffle sauce, which came in a separate sauce boat. It arrived after the reminder. And we also didn't get proper steak knifes, which took away from the experience a little bit. \n\nThe other people at the table liked their dishes, the bread, etc. My father in law ordered the veal medallions but a big hunk of lamb chop was placed in front of him. He alerted the server to the error but the server tried to pass off the lamb chop as \"better\" and acted surprised when my FIl still insisted on the veal medallions. That was odd. He later apologized for the mistake but it was still an odd way to handle the situation.\n\nWe ordered dessert souffles (caramel for hubby and I, strawberry for the other two couples) and it was a truly exceptional souffl\u00e9 which made up for the other mistakes at the meal. I would highly recommend!\n\nThe mistakes not withstanding, the restaurant is great for a romantic dinner. It could use a little more polish considering the pricing, but the ambiance makes up for all of that."

We advised them at the time of the reservation that, this is a birthday celebration.  \nOur service was great.  The food was okay.  We had few appetizers warm foie gras, steak tartar and sweet corn soup.  Then we went for foie gras and King filet mignon and Pork chop for dinner.  We saw a little bit of the Bellagio fountain view.  At this point we didn't care to try dessert anymore.  We just want to leave.  Medium Filet mignon was red.  My birthday girl didn't eat her medium cook filet.  Her complimentary dessert didn't have a candle.  How are you going to give a birthday girl desert without a candle... I guess no birthday wish to be made.  \nWe can go somewhere else. \nOverall if you want to see the epic view of Bellagio fountain.  I suggest to dine at Bellagio.  Lago has the best view of the fountain.  Very disappointed.  We frequently dine at the Top of the world which has a better view of the strip.  I can't recommend Eiffel Tower restaurant.

Keith, the bartender was wonderful and even discussed the ingredients in this wonderful drink which I will attempt at home. \n\nSince we were having such a great time at the bar, we were not sure if we were sitting there for more than 15 min. Another hostess came to let us know that a window table was available. We were not rushed at all.. When we were ready, that nice hostess took us to our table with a beautiful view. Lee was helping us with our dinner for the night. He was not Valentino that a lot of reviewers had mentioned but he sure was so thorough with the menu and is an expert with all courses. Lee  had the assistance of another nice gentleman that kept our water glasses poured and tasty bread offered several times. \n\nI already looked at the menus online but gave my companion a chance to look at the menu. I wanted to treat him to a tasting menu with wine pairing which he obliged. I won't go into details of what was on the tasting menu since it's available on the website. \n\nOverall, the food was very good. Have I had better? Yes, but the experience, the service, and the ambience made it wonderful. I normally don't care too much for lamb but this one  was done nicely, juicy and without that gamy taste. For desert, we chose the pistachios soufflet which Lee recommended and a plate full of different kinds of ice creams. By this time, i was too full already so I've only tasted the soufflet and it was quite good, very fluffy and moist. \n\nI should also mention that while waiting for our food to arrive, the photographer came and offered a photo with either the Paris sign or the view of the Bellagio fountain. We chose the fountain but i asked her if it would be possible to take it during the water show. As soon as the water show started, she came back and tried several times to make sure we have a nice background. Kudos to her professionalism. \n\nOverall, we had a nice dinner. Our check came out to be $474.83. While the whole experience/ambience/service is worth it, i can't say the food alone is worth it if it was not the whole experience. Toward the end of the dinner, we saw a lady that went to a table next to us to talk to another couple. I assumed that was Jennifer since the other reviews mentioned that she does stop by. I was hoping that if she did, we will thank her in person for helping us getting a table with a gorgeous view. However, she did not stop by our table so we did not get that chance. \n\nThe whole time we were there, the restaurant was full and it was a week night. All the window tables were always occupied. My companion enjoyed his birthday treat and wanted to visit Vegas again soon."

We were having dinner elsewhere and decided it would be wonderful to do dessert and champagne here with the great view.  We were contacted asking if we could come sooner to get a window table and were delighted. We rearranged our plans to make it work.  We arrived early and upon being seated noticed no desserts in the main menu and advised our waiter we only needed a dessert and drink menus. At this point the maitre d came over to inform us we could only have a table of we were each purchasing an entr\u00e9e.  Nowhere on open table does it state this, which we explained, but we were given an unconvincing perfunctory apology and asked again if we would like entr\u00e9es.  I'm easy going....you can have whatever rules you want.....but you need to make sure they are explained when you allow sites to set reservations.  Also, I counted 9 tables 4 window and 5 non window) THAT WERE EMPTY!!!  You really embarrassed us and lost out on what would have been a quick table turnover to keep an extra empty table?  Unbelievable."

It was so much fun, having all 7 courses come to us! They have you order dessert at the beginning, so we both decided to go with souffles. My man got banana, and I (who normally orders anything with chocolate) ordered the Pistachio souffle!\n\nThey start you off with these little cheese puff things (can't remember the name) but they are divine! They taste just like puffed up Cheez-its. \nOur first course was the amuse bouche..\nNext they brought by a warm lobster salad, which if it weren't so delicious, i would have BATHED in it. It was that good. I still dream about that salad.\nOur third course was  (i think..) a cream of celery soup, which was heavenly. At this point, the water show had begun at the Bellagio, and our table had a perfect front row view of it! It was wonderful, sipping our soup, watching the water show.\n\nOur fourth course was red snapper over braised vegetables.. They actually give you a generous portion of red snapper, too! Perfectly cooked and soooo flavorful.\n\nFifth course was venison with huckleberries and braised chestnuts.. Which I was SO excited for, having never tried venison until then. It was melt-in-your-mouth phenomenal. \n\nOur 6th course that arrived was wine poached pear slices wrapped around camambert(sp?) cheese, served with warm cinnamon raisin bread... ohhhh my god. \n\nOur last and final course (my stomach was BUSTING at this point) were our souffles.. which was up there with some of the best dessert I'd ever had. Our server brought us some assorted candies with our check, which was such a special treat, although I couldn't eat one last bit!\n\nThe service was prompt, professional, and very attentive! Our server was so much fun, he reminded me of my grandpa! \n\nThis is the perfect place to take your lover on a special occasion, and WELL worth the money. I *highly* recommend doing the pre-fix, you get so much food for your money, and you will leave STUFFED, i promise you!!"

There were four empty table by the window, none of which filled up the whole time we were dining.\n\nNonetheless, we didn't let it kill the mood. We ordered a delicious bottle of pinot noir (I forget which) and ordered the blue cheese souffle. It was AWESOME. So light, yet incredibly flavorful at the same time. \n\nDinner: I had the NY Steak with cranberry/bone marrow sauce on top. Seriously the best steak I've ever eaten in my life. It may have been the best meal I've ever had in my life. It was juicy and flavorful, perfectly cooked. My husband had a filet mignon with foie gras w/truffle oil.

The one thing that I can say that had a slightly negative impact on me was the fact that I said a personal all time high for the amount of money I spent on a single meal for just two people. Spend more money on this one meal then most people spend on food for several months. The reason it doesn't lower the star rating is because I did that to myself. I figured you only have one 10 year anniversary and might as well do it big."

They came thru for us big-time!\n\nI didn't actually utilize their \"proposal package\" per se, as I had already popped the question a little over an hour beforehand during a rather elaborate day of events... but Annie did arrange for several elements of their proposal package to be included with our dinner \"package\".  [customized menus printed, flowers for the table, pictures, tour to top of the tower and the 2 hour limo tour after dinner]\n\nAs far as the food: We started with a caviar course and enjoyed a bottle of Dom.  We did the full tasting menu with wine pairings for dinner and ended with a couple of souffle's.  I did the chocolate souffle and my bride-to-be the pistachio souffle. EVERYTHING we ate was spectacular!!!!!  I am not a fish fan, but the halibut that came as one of the courses in the tasting menu really was a to-die-for dish! \n\nService:  We were treated like a king & queen!  I couldn't have asked for anything better.. all of the restaurant personnel, from the waiters to the photographer were first class.\n\nView & Atmosphere:  We were seated at the special corner table you see in all the pics.  It was special.. It was awesome!  \n\nGripes: I really only have one.. and that is the markup for the champagne was atrocious by even Vegas standards.  But with that being said.. would I pay it again there? YUP!  \n\nExcluding the price of the champagne ($510 for 2002 bottle of Dom), I found there to be wonderful value to the rest of the meal.

Can it be that we're used to seeing the view or it may be the new way they configured the tables.  Now small half round tables butted against the windows and so close to other couples that it doesn't feel as intimate.  My husband and I came (again) to celebrate our anniversary.  My husband ordered a couple of cocktails and I ordered 2 glasses of Pinot Noir.  We shared the kale salad that was a little over powered by a sweet yet tart dressing, tart cherries, walnuts and quinoa croutons that were a little soggy. Was a little disappointed that they didn't split the salad for us but served it along with 2 small plates so we divided it ourselves.  The NY steak and filet mignon was cooked to perfection and was delicious.  We shared the potato Anna - a crispy sliced buttery potato that was a tad too salty and green beans almondine that was very fresh and tasty.  For dessert we ordered the famous chocolate souffl\u00e9 which was delicate and rich along with a cappuccino and an Irish coffee.  Our server, David then brought a small chocolate mousse on a plate with \"happy anniversary\" piped in chocolate around the rim... Very delicious!  We were then presented with and got to choose from an assortment of complementary petit fours.  So stuffed at this point but couldn't resist :)\nDavid was the greatest, very friendly and made us feel comfortable, giving us the space to have a romantic dinner while making sure we were attended to.

First, the tricky part is to find the elevator, it is somewhere in the middle of the casino (tip: just look up at the legs of the Eiffel Tower because they come through the ceiling and find the middle that way). There were two host's (one female, one male) to greet you at the elevator (I assumed to confirm reservations or whatever), so they tell me that there is a dress code and shorts are going to cut it (it was 112 degrees out and I'm not going to walk around in slacks that for sure), so I turn to Amanda and say sorry, then thank the host anyways. But then he says \"hold on, what size pants are you\", he says we have a couple pairs if you wouldn't mind throwing them on before coming up. I say \"sure\" and I almost dropped my pants right there but he said \"the washroom is just across the way, sir\". As I go change the male host proceeds to escort Amanda up the elevator and to a table. When I finished, the lady kindly escorts me up (I couldn't figure out why we were getting pampered so but then I saw the bill!!). \n\nThe elevator was fun, you get a chance to wave or stick up your nose (which ever you prefer) at all the people outside before you get to your floor. So the elevator opens and it's the kitchen, I'm kind of scratching my head but then the lovely host grabs my arm and escorts me around and out of the kitchen then to my table. You have to keep in mind that the pants that they gave me are at least 3 times bigger then I am, so I'm almost waddling try to get to my seat trying to make sure I don't lose the pants and flash all of Vegas. \n\nThere are two things that make this restaurant unbelievable. First, the view is amazing, three sides of floor to ceiling glass. One side the north side of the strip, the other the south, but the front is all the Bellagio. If you know anything about the Bellagio, then you know about the musical fountain which occurs every 15 minutes. So you get to watch this show if you have seats in the front (tip for the guys... it's very romantic). The second thing is the menu, it is absolutely insane... Chilled Fennel Vichyssoise with Shrimp, Caviar, fish, fowl, and even a vegetarian dish. Unfortunately for us, we were already full from dinner (fortunate for my wallet though, this place is up there $25 to $55 a plate, $340 for 50 grams** of Caviar). Still, I wish had some caviar, maybe next time. The service was excellent too. \n\nYou must go!! \n\n** 1 gram is about the weight of a Bic pen cap."

Any bad reviews are attributed to bad service. I ate there on a Monday night (7/5) and the service was great! When we first got there, the table wasn't ready, so we waited in the bar which was dark but I felt sexy just sitting there. We got seated in front of the window, the Bellagio fountain show is great for filling awkward silence. Our waiter greeted us and he was very friendly, although he started out with an Irish accent and by the end of the meal it was Van Damme/George St. Pierre. \n\nWe ordered: \n-Foie Gras with braised bing cherries\n-Sea bass with tomato quinoa (I've never had quinoa so delicious)\n-Beef wellington (good sized portion, we left with take home)\n-Crispy Pomme Dauphines (the serving size is a lot for 2 people)\n-chocolate souffle for dessert\n\nWe also ordered 3 cocktails and our bill came out to about $180. Considering it's Las Vegas and a bottle of water will cost you $2.50, our bill wasn't bad. The food was good, the view was great, service is friendly. The only thing was we didn't get a special birthday treat for the birthday boy so I'll knock off a star for that.\n\nDon't forget to:\n-Dress up\n-Make reservation\n-Order a souffle in the beginning"

            "review": "I once read, \" Don't be so quick to judge, you never know when you might just find yourself walking in that person's shoes.\" Well, in my experience of dining at Eiffel Tower Restaurant, that quote might just very well ends with \"you never know when you might just find yourself sitting at their best table, and enjoy it, too!!\"\n\nWhile planning our Anniversary/Christmas Trip to Vegas, BF asked that I must plan a meal here because he had such a phenomenal experience in the past. I begrudgingly agreed because I thought there are so many new and exciting restaurants on the strip that we can try. So, me, being the shortsighted idiot, made a reservation for lunch instead of dinner. \n\nAfter we checked in with the host and hopped onto the exclusive elevator that somehow managed to transport us from the tackiness around Paris Hotel to a realm of sheer elegance. Sure enough, knowing it was an anniversary celebration trip for us, the thoughtful folks from Eiffel Tower Restaurant seated us at their famous corner table (yes, Table 56!!) With the breathtaking view, the etiquettes from our attentive ma\u00eetre d', server, and busboy, I suddenly realized that my BF's stubbornness wasn't that much of a burden after all. \n\nOur server and bus boy promptly presented and served us the menu and freshly made baguette. Our server thoroughly explained every item on the menu to us, and we opted for:\n\n- Creamy French Onion Soup (unlike any other French onion soup, this wasn't as cheesy nor greasy but rather light. Please don't get me wrong; the flavors and the creaminess weren't compromised in any way.)\n- Cold Foie Gras Torchon (rich and dense foie gras wrapped with duck prosciutto, along with fig, and then smeared on top of the brioche. I particularly enjoyed how the foie gras was presented in a similar texture as butter and the way it melts upon ingestion.)\n- Lamb Burger (As a big fan of lamb, I naturally ordered it medium rare. The spices immersed the lamb heavenly, served with chips, and a side of harissa aioli.) \n- Aged Parmesan Crusted Chicken (crispy and juicy, it reminded me of the chicken schnitzel that I had from \"Johannes\" at Palms Springs.)\n\nPlus...\n\n- Apple strudel (I usually don't like to mix fruit with dessert, so it's my BF who ordered this. However, I fairly enjoyed my few bites of p\u00e2te feuillet\u00e9e dipped in the caramel sauce.)\n\nOther than the strudel, they also sent us a complimentary chocolate souffl\u00e9 for our anniversary, which was a very lovely gesture. Now that I'm thinking back, my biggest regret during my entire trip was that not only I didn't get to taste their evening tasting menu, but I also didn't get a chance to try their famous Grand Marnier Souffl\u00e9 (since it's only served during dinner.) Mind you, prior to my lunch at Eiffel Tower, BF and I had just our previous dinner at \"Le Cirque,\" and quite frankly that dinner was not even close to this lunch at Eiffel Tower Restaurant. I applaud the classiness of their attentive and gracious staffs. My highest compliments to the chefs and the entire Eiffel Tower Restaurant Team, for this exceptionally exquisite meal and making us feel special the entire time. I cannot wait to go back!!"

I also asked if they can put roses on the table. When we arrived, everything was organized and roses were there. Joshua was our waiter. I have never seen anyone provide such high level of service. In Seattle, we ate at Canlis, Rover's, and some other expensive restaurants, but we have never seen anyone come close to Joshua's level of service. This guy was amazing. We took his advice and recommendation and ended up being extremely happy at the end of the night. Food was amazing. Wine was great. Their dessert is so good you may experience orgasm. This restaurant will not disappoint you. It is expensive, but it is worth every single penny. Right there and then, we decided to make it our annual tradition to come to the Eiffel Tower every year on March 8. Thank you Joshua, thank you Eiffel Tower!"

I wouldn't expect anything less. \n\nFrom the moment your brought up in the elevator to the moment you head back to the hustle and bustle of the casino, you definitely are living an experience. \n\nLow lighting and a view that can't be beat, fine linens, and wait staff who attend to your every need, the Eiffel Tower is first class all the way. \n\nI selected their smoked salmon to start and I have never had a better piece of fish. Smooth, thinly sliced, and melt in your mouth buttery taste accompanied the onion, capers, and creme fraiche (not sure of my French spelling here) with several slices of perfectly toasted bread. I could have eaten a second plate and called it a meal. The capers were surprisingly delicious - not the over salted from a jar variety. \n\nMost of us selected their filet mignon, with several different toppings to choose from. I couldn't resist and chose the decadent Bernaise sauce. The steak itself was cooked to perfection and the interior was almost as buttery smooth as the sauce itself. There were a ton of sides passed around our table, but the winners were the potatoes gratin (perfect in their simplicity) and the mushroom sp\u00e4tzle (yes they eat German food in parts of France). \n\nDesserts probably deserve their own review, but to put it simply; save room and order a bunch to taste and share. The chocolate plate will leave any chocoholic in heaven. \n\nPricey, but worth every penny."

Viva Las Vegas! \n\nSo if you want a fine dinning strip experience with a great view, ask for a window seat and I do suggest you try it out if you like French American and steakhouses, especially if you're staying in the Paris Hotel or nearby.\n\nI've been twice. Once for dinner with a girlfriend and the other for Thanksgiving my freshman year of college. I can't remember what my girlfriend and I got and this was only a few years ago, but not to the establishment's detriment, only to our detailing, because we always remembered it as being delicious and very well done. We definitely had no complaints, but we were not as picky then also. Looking back, I remember it being amazing plates but not mind blowing or the type to make you feel like a Romance in Paris amazing. Which honestly, you're going to expect at a place like that. I wonder if it's just as good today. \n\nThanksgiving dinner was really amazing. That in itself is amazing, considering it was a fixed menu night and everyone in the restaurant was eating the exact same plates. It was not like you're used to, those- here you go, here's a basic fancy diner thanksgiving plate since you're obviously not getting home cooked turkey this year. Not like those at all. It was delicious. Granted the turkey was the blandest thing on the plate, but it was a beautiful bland. And it hardly had a chance behind the brussels sprouts. The nirvana sprouts. Little baby cabbage gods. They were divine and I did die to them. SO I'd suggest get something with brussels (if they have and especially if you love brussels sprouts) because that's the best thing I had there and they sure do it right. \n\nService, ambiance and presence match the price. Can't speak for much else. \n\nWill definitely go back and update this review."

We were in Vegas celebrating a 40th birthday and I just couldn't decide where to go for dinner on Saturday night but it had to be special whatever it was.  I was searching around on Yelp and found the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  I noticed quickly that the majority of the reviews were good...but then I noticed the Manager of the restaurant actually commenting on the reviews so that intrigued me a lot.  I contact Jennifer and she responded to me right away and was happy to help me make our dinner a special night for my best friend. \n\nWe showed up at 8pm and the place was bustling.  Great atmosphere...You have to take the elevator up into the Eiffel Tower itself and when you arrive you get to walk through the kitchen to get to the main dinning area -- the kitchen was awesome everyone dressed the way you expect a 5 star restaurant to look...it was bright and CLEAN....I was amazed they cooked in there it was so spotless!  Once you round the corner you get to the main dinning room and the bar is immediately to the left, but what really captures your eyes is the view....from everywhere in the place you see floor to ceiling windows and all the lights of Vegas...it was spectacular!!!\n\nJennifer greeted us and she was awesome.  Took us right to our table with a fantastic view of the Bellagio water fountains.  We were able to watch the water show the entire evening as we dined.  It was so awesome I can't even tell you.\n\nThe waiter was the best I had had in a restaurant in I can't even remember.  They were so attentive but not on top of you asking constantly if you needed anything...they were just there and ready to take care of whatever we needed without us thinking about it.\n\nThe food was the best.   Jennifer sent over a nice plate of appetizers that were all personalized for each person (meaning we each had our own sample plate)  they were so good I could have licked the plate!!!  We also had a small bowl of a cold cauliflower soup that left me wanting more....the cocktails were mixed well and had just the right amount of flavor to alcohol you would expect.  When the main courses arrived we were in food heaven.  Three of us had beef dishes and one friend had the sea bass...ALL OF THE DISHES were divine.  Lastly we ordered at the top of the meal a chocolate souffle that melted in  your mouths...since it was a special birthday they also sent over a lovely desert just for the birthday girl and some samples of their sorbet.  Again I can't tell you how good it was so you have to go try yourself. \n\nThis restaurant was the best experience I have ever had in a 5 star establishment -- they made us feel welcomed and I can't wait to go back.  All four of us have been telling all of our friends!!!  I just hope Jennifer and her staff can handle all the press because I am certain that she will be getting a lot of business and calls from our reviews!!!!"

Hubby ordered Slow Roasted Filet of Atlantic Salmon and I had the Muscovy Duck Breast. Can I just say that I absolutely despise salmon, but was so tempted to switch and steal the mister's salmon? What stopped me was that I was IN LOVE with the duck! I woke up the next day dreaming of going back, ahhh so good. \n\nWe had Classic Potato Gratin as a side and Creme Brulee as the dessert and my oh my, by this point I was in Frenchfoodecstasyland. Some of the best freaking food I've had in my LIFE, hands down. \n\nAlso the portions were perfect and though they take a long time bringing out the food between courses it was perfect for relaxing and conversing while watching the Bellagio fountain display. Veeerrry romantic :)\n\nThe staff was also very nice, especially one girl in particular who came over and took our picture with the fountains in the back and even complimented my dress. She was the cutest little pregnant person I've ever seen, ha! *creeper* We bought the picture afterwards, it's a nice keepsake :)\n\nWord to the wise, go a bit earlier though. Our reservation was for 8:15 so we weren't done until close to 10:30p...and by around 10:00 all the obnoxious drunks had started getting annoying; men and women alike, but one loudmouth man in particular kept shouting and hooting across the restaurant. It was incredibly disturbing and put a damper on the end of dinner because in such a quiet place it can be pretty startling. I was actually surprised that they didn't kick them out because of the type of place it is. I wish they had.\n\nAnyway. Can't waaaait to go back!"

Reservations were made prior so I couldn't wait to see the positioning of tables, just as requested there was a table for two amongst the best seats in the restruant  by the windows which provided beautiful views that overlooked the strip and the Bellagio Fountains. The waitstaff was very attentive and the food was delish, I tried the lamb for the night. Although, I've never been to Paris it gave me a small taste of what's to come when I travel there next summer. Will totally go again in the near future. The whole experience was definitely worth it."

Well it all changed when we went to Eiffel Tower. We loved it right from getting into the elevator to time we made an exit the with our souvenier (little too pricey picture). \n\nFood : We both aren't much of foodie when it comes to experimenting and me being Vegetarian further limits the options. My boyfriend opted for chicken based entree while I had no choice but to go for only Vegetarian item i.e. Vegetarian Crepes. And my my was the food delicious!! yes it was 100%. I got too tempted when I saw the chicken and tasted for myself. It was pefect tender inside , cooked with precision and the flavors yumm.. My crepes were incredible. The sauce on my plate was to die for. I had mushroom spaetzel were amazing and recipe sounded pretty interesting. My boyfriend had potato on the side, very different and very yumm. After reading all the other reviews I took pistachio souffle. I found it little bitter, I'l ltry chocolate flavor next time. So, all the vegetarians outs there , don't worry !\n\nView : I got lucky or may be it was my little note when I made reservations in OpenTable ,that we got the table with the view. The view was BREATHTAKING. Ambience could have been romantic but for the crowd making noise. But it was more of happy noise that saves a place from getting dull. I didn't mind it. I had enough romance going on in my small table enjoying the fountains.\n\nDress Code : They say that formal dress code is required but I saw men in shorts all the time. But seriusly , this place has all the makings of a special night. So, I'd suggesst make it a dressy unforgettable night !\n\nService : We had to wait for a while because we were about 45 mins late for our 8:15 reservation (blame my flat iron process). Service was quite nice except for the first waitress who served us wine who seemed reluctant to offer an extra napkin ! We found it wierd but it wasn't a big deal. Our server compensated for this faux pas for rest of the evening.\n\nWe even got our picture taken because it was just so perfect !\nJ'aime Eiffel Tower !\nHighly recommended !"

Time your trip with the Bellagio fountain show.  The tower ride isn't free, but the view is soooo worth it, especially if you get to see the fountain show.\n\nOnto the food / service / restaurant experience.  I normally only talk about the food and the service in my reviews, but coming here was truly an experience.  When you step out of the elevator, you get a full view of the kitchen.  You can see everyone in their matching chef attire.  You can see how clean the kitchen is.  It's really neat!\n\nWe were celebrating our anniversary, so we got a great table.  The view was great.  Someone came by to take a souvenir photo.\n\nThe food was also good.  Not the best food in Vegas, but the experience certainly made up for it.\n\nThis was also a rather expensive meal, a few hundred at least (plus the souvenir photo!), but it was so worth it.  I would definitely recommend this place!"

But I would NOT recommend this place.\n\nI went with a group for a business dinner. I had the squash soup first. ($18) It was kind of bland. Nothing made it stand out. A lot of money for a bland soup.\n\nThen I tried the Venison, Parsnip, Braised Cabbage entry, simply to try something I don't often get. It was served red, raw and wriggling. OK, not wriggling, but I did not enjoy the taste or the soft, chewy feel in my mouth. It was not succulent or tasty. Just something to chew and swallow. For $54, I expected something far more memorable. The one thing I did enjoy was the Classic Potato Gratin side dish ($10). I should have just ordered that! Or maybe 3 of them.\n\nOne amusing thing, probably more indicative of Vegas itself than of this place, was how relentless the waiters were in \"suggesting\" things we could order. They are marketing machines. Even as we wound down with desert, a waiter was right there with a list of expensive dessert wines, just pushing and pushing them. And then when our host picked one, \"why not get two?\" Funny to watch. \n\nOverall, expect to pay a lot for a nice view, and come away feeling ripped off for mediocre fare."

Attentive and polite service. \n\nI had a garden salad and the creamed French onion soup. The salad was beautifully presented in a cucumber wrap. Unfortunately it was drowned in olive oil and has no flavor. I didn't taste any but oil. The creamed French onion soup had potential but was over powered by salt. The cheesy crouton was salty enough for a less salt ladened soup. My boyfriend had the veggie crepe which was ok. Nothing creative tastebud-wise. The prices are high as is customary along the LV strip. Overall a three star place."

If you have reservations (I make mine through OpenTable), you always get seated before the walk-ins.   They open for lunch at 11:30, and even if there were about 10 other people that had been waiting, my cousin and I were seated first.  The meal usually starts with a vegetable mousse in a tiny cup that you eat with a tiny spoon.  I've had tomato and spinach in the past and while they were delicious, this time we had mushroom.  And it was splendid.  My favorite meal is pretty standard here: Crab-stuffed avacado, pan-seared trout with butter and wild rice, and the summer berry pudding dessert.  To drink: Ginger Peach Tea.  My cousin ordered a fois gras appetizer with fig and a salmon entree with the fish hammered flat, seasoned, and fried.  We both had a bowl of the cream of celery soup.  The food is DELICIOUS!  A huge bonus is the tiny cheese and poppy seed popovers that they give you with every meal.  The service is attentive, at times a bit much, but  way better than being ignored.  Our check came out to about $200.  Eiffel Tower is always a must visit when I'm in town."

My side was green beans which were served on a horrible looking tray and my drink was terrible, my hubby and i left with a stomach ache. The only good thing about this place is the view if you sit by the window which we did, that was not worth the over $200.

To my surprise, they asked for my credit card number over the phone, which I have never done before. This guarantees your reservation, and if you cancel I believe they charge $50 to your card. A dress code is also enforced, although the woman I spoke to over the phone told me that jeans are allowed as long as they are not ripped up. \n\nAs others have already mentioned, you take the (small) elevator to the 11th floor where the restaurant is located. The elevator opens up in front of the kitchen. As soon as we arrived, one of the employees said \"What are you doing in the kitchen?\" He then gave us a warm greeting and walked us to where we would check in. \n\nWe had a great table by the window with a awesome view! My husband and I thought the restaurant would be higher up than it actually was, but it was perfect! We really enjoyed the view of the Bellagio fountains (every 15 minutes) and the strip. \n\nWhat we ordered for dinner:\n-Maine Peekey Toe Crab Salad: with cucumber and black sesame seeds. Very light and tasty with a vinaigrette type of dressing. Good choice for an appetizer!\n\n-Char Broiled Filet Mignon: with lemon parsley butter. It was cooked the way I wanted and easy to cut into pieces. It wasn't the best steak I have ever eaten, but I still enjoyed it. I also felt that the butter was too thick and it took a while to melt down. \n\n-Aged New York Steak: my husband ordered this. He pretty much felt the same way I did about my steak. It was good, but definitely not the best.\n\n-Potato Anna: as our side order. It was basically thinly sliced potatoes that were layered on a plate. Not much to say about it, but there's nothing wrong with potatoes cooked with butter!\n\nFor Dessert:\n-Chocolate Souffle: After we ordered our dinner, our server asked us if we wanted to order a Souffle because it takes about 30 minutes for them to prepare it. It was interesting when they brought it to our table. First they make a hole in the center of the souffle, then they pour in the chocolate sauce inside. I was a bit disappointed because it wasn't as good as I was hoping it to be. The cake was very moist and fluffy, but I felt that it needed more chocolate sauce.\n\n-I was surprised with a complimentary Chocolate Mousse for my birthday! It tasted great and I definitely enjoyed it more than the Chocolate Souffle! I also liked how they served it on a plate with \"Happy Birthday\" written in Chocolate sauce!\n\nService was top notch! Our server was Pierre. He was friendly, entertaining, and very attentive. He made us laugh, smile, and really wanted us to enjoy our dinner! Also there is a photographer that walks around asking if you would like to take a picture with the illuminated Paris Balloon in the background. We decided why not, and liked how it came out. We paid $24 for a 5x7 photo. Ouch. I know, but it was worth it for us!\n\nMy only complaint is that the tables are packed in very close together. The aisles are also very narrow, so it takes a while to pass by other tables and to get out. \n\nOur bill was expensive! But we definitely enjoyed the experience and our night here! Hopefully the food will be better the second time around if we ever come back!"

Three small pieces with the star the bleu cheese.  I could have stolen the wheel from the kitchen if I could have gotten away with it.\n\nThe mignardises tray had one new item that I could tell.  The rest have been around for years.\n\nService was excellent!! Isabelle was personable, knowledgable, and a delight to talk to.\n\nWhat I'm looking from Chef Joho is to take a chance.

We called our favorite deli, but they weren't serving breakfast anymore, so we made our way to the Tour Eiffel. \nIt was brunch time, but on a Monday.  \n\nThe short trip up the elevator adds to the thrill, and entering through the spotless kitchen is an event in itself.  The restaurant had just opened, so it was deserted and we were seated by the window, across from the Bellagio lagoon.  It was a dry sunny day, and the great view just added to the ambience.  The structure of the tower with beams and rivets adds to the decor, and feeling of being transported.  \n\nI was encouraged to practice speaking French, and all the waiters were perfectly happy to parle avec moi, et ils sont plus polite!!  The waiter suggested a mimosa, and the meal was on.  I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.  The service was the most suave and unobtrusive I have ever had in America, with each dish being whisked away just as we finished it.  The amuse bouche of mushroom flan was a delight, as was the meal.  We didn't have desert, but decided to return to the restaurant for Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nAs we left, we were happy to meet the manager of the kitchen, and spot the chef at work with his crew.  \n\nWe were snowed on a side trip to Zion, and made reservations for Thanksgiving dinner at the last minute upon returning to Las Vegas.\nCuriously there was only one table left, and it was at the exact time, 4:15 that we requested.  We had calculated the time to give us the most sunset view.  Not even expecting a window seat, we were delighted to be seated at the window, again with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains, and the Paris hot air balloon.   The restaurant also provided a photographer, and we took advantage of the opportunity to have our photo taken with the balloon and lights in the background!\n\n The waiter was the professional, humorous, and good natured about my speaking French!  He was knowledgeable, and courteous in a way that only the best waiter can be!  We did have the prix fixe Thanksgiving meal, and the turkey was the most delicious that I have ever had.  I am now a big turkey fan, because of the dryness factor, but this was moist, delicious, and the skin perfectly browned.  It was treated like the game bird that it actually is, and roasted with flair and dedication!\nThe cabbage and Brussels sprouts were cooked to perfection, and the chestnut dressing brought back memories of childhood.  The potatoes were yummy and delicious.  We ordered ahead, and had the pumpkin souffle, which was light as air, and yet flavorful.\n\nI must say, it was the best Thanksgiving ever.  Light and delightful, with a French flair!!  Merci mille fois au La Tour Eiffel!!"

We were seated by the window and were able to watch the Bellagio water show the entire night. Between meals, they gave us small, but very succulent food too. We also ordered dessert and it was a plateful of different types of chocolate! The bill was only $130 so it wasn't bad at all! Very reasonable price for a dinner for two. \n\nThey also offer professional pictures to buy when you first step in. They have a perfect background setting inside the restaurant!"

I was expecting fine dinning experience and the hospitality of this place is far from acceptable. \nThe waitress there cant stop telling us how we used the wrong knife for butter. Don't know to ask before taking the plate away to make sure we are done with that dish or not. She ended up offending the birthday person several times ('Fine Dinning'). Finally we asked the manager to give us a different waitress for the table. The manager after listening to all this said 'we don't have anyone else right now to replace her'. I at least expected that a manager of a so called fine dining should be able to take up the role of a waitress and resolve a situation like this. \nEither ways, I am used to going to fine dining restaurants in San Diego and OC on a regular basis and this place needs a lot of training to reach the standards of the industry."

            "review": "I don't know where to start! My girlfriend and I were in Vegas attending the Electric Daisy Carnival which coincided with our 2 year anniversary. Immediately we started looking for the finest restaurants Las Vegas Boulevard had to offer. We tossed around ideas, and drew up a list. The Eiffel Tower restaurant had  fantastic price point that didn't degrade service or quality. Of course we dressed up for the occasion, however I did note that some patrons where wearing beach shorts and t-shirts. Not really the kind of ambiance I'd like when spending around $400 including tip. But alas I dined like royalty and enjoyed my stay. I started off with the Heirloom Tomato, California Burrata, Balsamic Aspic, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil salad. It was beyond words and more than just a salad. The flavors that my palate were introduced to were unbelievable. My lovely girlfriend went with the Warm Maine Lobster, White Wine Braised Baby Leeks, Mustard Vinaigrette  that was sublime. Tender, succulent and bursting with flavor. A Light size portion that is more about taste and saving room for the next course. For my entree I went with the Char Broiled Filet Mignon, Rossini Style, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce. One of the best meals I've ever had the privilege to enjoy. Definitely worth the $79 it was priced at. Ill include a picture of this wonderful bit of paradise. I was hesitant to try foie gras but my curiosity was rewarded with an delicacy  that is no longer available in Los Angeles. It was cooked to perfection and looked as immaculate as it was delectable. My girlfriend had the Prime Aged Bone-In Ribeye, Caramelized Onions and added the black truffle sauce that complimented it exquisitely. A magnificent slab of meat suitable for a king or queen in this case. Bought some cocktails that seemed overpriced but the craftsmanship put into concocting them is well worth the steep price. The servers go out the way to make you feel comfortable, and for the time that you are there like you were as important as the president. Never did I feel hovered over or stared at as if I didn't belong. My visit was a little less than a year ago and to this day 4/23/2014 I am still raving about it. We are going back to EDC Las Vegas this year and are struggling to find another restaurant to match the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. And the killer view of the fountains and strip is more romantic than can be described. Definitely a meal that will stand out for a long time. Adieu!"

We come from Wine Country with San Francisco less than an hour north.  San Diego and Los Angeles are a couple of places we like to frequent down South and up North, Portland and Seattle are our stomping grounds. The food was \"good for Las Vegas,\" but not outstanding when you're already accustomed to eating some of the best food in the world.  \n\nThe hollandaise sauce on the green beans was so lemony that it overpowered the dish and made it too bitter to eat.  The au gratin potatoes were surprisingly bland.   \n\nThere are only so many buffets and chains that you can eat at, so this was a nice reprieve but overall you could grab tickets to the elevator in the eiffel tower to take in the fantastic view and save yourself more than a few bucks.  Glad I went but most likely won't be back."

If you want to snag on of the fabulous window tables with the gorgeous view of the strip, they will only guarantee those table for reservations before 6pm. Otherwise it's fist come, first served.\n\nOur reservation was at 6:30, and they were able to seat us by the window on a Sunday night. We started the meal with a strawberry basil mojito. It was pretty delicious except it was served with a metal straw, which gave it a slightly metallic taste. We opted to try the tasting menu at $98 per person to try a little bit of everything.\n\nHonestly, I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the best part of this experience is not the food. However, my favorite part of the meal was the oyster in the amuse-bouche with caviar on it. Also, their baguette bread was actually excellent and probably the best I've had outside of Paris. Have some! The Maine lobster salad and the rack of lamb were tasty, but the corn soup and the halibut were sub-par. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the caramel souffle and the passion fruit meringue with champagne sauce. My fiance proposed right before dessert came out and he was able to pull it off discretely without causing a big scene luckily. Although all the tables by the window are very close to each other, facing out onto the Bellagio fountains made the experience more private and intimate. I was too overwhelmed to eat much of the dessert, but the little bit I had didn't blow me away at all.\n\nThe only people to really noticed we got engaged were the couple next to us who generously sent over two glasses of champagne for us since they were on honeymoon. The restaurant did absolutely nothing for us to congratulate us, which was a bit of a disappointment for me. I heard a statistic that 300 couples get married in Vegas every day, but these are still very special moments for people that should be treated as such.\n\nOverall, this is a nice place to go to for a special occasion but I would not recommend splurging on the tasting menu. Go for the view and the bread!"

Unlike Tao, they didn't give away our table and they didn't scold us.  I like the Eiffel Tower Restaurant already!  Did I mention we all wore jeans to dinner?  Score!\n\nYes, this is a very romantic restaurant; yes, there is a beautiful view.  Service was impeccable, decor very lovely, yada yada.   Really though, it was all about the food.  We started off with cocktails - I recommend the Autumn in Paris (it's like a pear slushee, with booze).  For an appetizer I had the sea scallops (Sauteed Sea Scallops, Cauliflower Mousseline,Riesling Jus).  Best.  Scallops.  Ever.  I don't even like cauliflower!  For my entree, I opted to try the sea bass (though next time, I'm all about the venison).   The sea bass was perfectly cooked, and served with potatoes and bacon (helllooooo!!!  How awesome is that??).  But the best part of the meal was dessert.  My friends and I are all greedy beyotches, so we each ordered our own souffle:  chocolate, pistachio, and banana.  Each was amazing, but the banana took the cake for me.

We searched several other places and were weary from the crowds when we happened upon the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. The host assured us that the wait was minimal and whisked us off to the elevator.

We waited under ten minutes and were given a table with a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains. \n\nThe brought a cold cauliflower soup as well as portions of crusty baguette that were excellent, to start.\n\nWe ordered coffee, an iced tea, the French BLT Tower, as well as the Paillard of Salmon. Both were very decent portions and eloquently plated. My salmon was very decent, although it did not have the fatty quality that I love about salmon. It appeared to be pounded very thin onto my oval plate, and a salad was precariously stacked to the ride side of it. To the left, was a lemon in cloth. The top had been brushed with a mustard glaze and spices - it was very good, albeit different than I'm used to. \n\nWe sat and watched the fountains for a while, and really enjoyed ourselves.

The only low point of the meal was our server this time, he was dry and a little rushed.  didnt take any time explaining the menu, or even bothering to ask why we were there like others do.  It would have made our special ocassion even better.  The first time we went there, we had an older gentleman that was exceptional so I guess it depends who you get.  If service would have been better I would give it 5 stars."

Turkey a little bland for my taste but the sides were excellent (red cabbage, au gratin potatoes).  The chef surprised us with a couple of \"extras\"...cold celery soup and multiple desserts.  All excellent.  A beautiful location with a great view of the Bellagio Fountains and the strip.  A great evening."

When we mentioned we were catching a flight they seemed to step on it and got our food out pretty quickly, and handled the check with remarkable speed.\n\nThe overall the meal was very good. My only complaint would be the value proposition, which was an issue for me in many of the restaurants we visited. You pay a lot of money for good or ok food. Some of these places, like the Eiffel, have redeeming qualities that I'm sure are factored into the prices.\n\nThe setting is very romantic, red & white decor with mellow music and dim lighting.\n\nNOTE: if there is a party going on at the club the music will reach the restaurant. Some may find that annoying.\n\nWe had a window table that offered a fantastic view of the strip. The half circle tables allow guests to sit close together while enjoying the view with no effort. If you're lucky, or if you plan it, you can get a table right across from the Bellagio and get to see the water show while enjoying your dinner. On any other table the view will still be great.\n\nThe corn soup was unimpressive. The lamb and the filet mignon were cocked perfectly, and were savory and tender. The side of potatoes au gratin wad good, the mushrooms but so much.\n\nIf you have the budget, and are looking for a romantic and impressive venue with good food, the Eiffel is a sure bet."

Their sommelier recommend a wonderful Cabernet from Sheffer, which we truly enjoyed. The steak tartare was amazing!!! One of the best I've ever had! I ordered the beef Wellington which was good, but not the best I've ever had, though I did enjoy it (I'm a Wellington snob, it's my favorite). I have to say the Wellington was cooked perfectly and came out as rare as possible. My girlfriend got the Filet Mignon Rossini style, with the fois gras, which was absolutely amazing and I wish I had ordered it! I highly recommend that dish. We finished the meal with the featured Nutella Suffle, which was cooked to perfection, subtle and delicious!!! Honestly, my compliments to the chefs!  We then capped the meal off with excellent espresso shots, not too bitter, just smooth and enjoyable. I highly recommend this restaurant to people who enjoy French food, it has a wonderful view and amazing atmosphere to boot!"

With all of this perfection going on, I truly feel silly even mentioning the negatives, but for me, the experience really has to be impeccable to give that 5 star rating. We were packed in so tight that my husband and I almost had to look at each other sideways to enjoy each other's company.

The Eiffel tower is popular and well worth it.\n\nTo get there, we entered into the Paris Casino and took an elevator to the 11th level.  We were welcomed by the kitchen to the restaurant, which I thought was the wrong floor, but it was the right one.  We walked around to the other side and found a breath taking view with full windows of the lights and the Vegas strip below.  I really enjoyed the interior architecture of the Eiffel tower steel framing as part of the decor.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower Restaurant is very pricey.  As for my first meal and visit to Las Vegas, this was tops.  I was very impressed with the service.  Not a single person was under dressed and I'm sure I would have felt either uncomfortable in jeans or asked to leave.\n\nWe order a bottle of wine and were taken care of extremely well.

(the only bad thing about our meal... it took so long to get our food).\n\nWe came here for breakfast for our anniversary. First they give you a corn thing almost like a pudding, but it was sweet and a nice touch. We were also given small bread puffs that were delicious! I had the souffl\u00e9 which was really good. It was a little bit hard at the bottom, seemed like a croissant type of thing. I really loved the top though, very light and delicious. The egg popped just perfectly over it all. It doesn't look very big but it was quite filling! Boyfriend had eggs Benedict. That was pretty good too, but how can that be bad at a high class restaurant? I had a strawberry lemonade that tasted like strawberries crushed in my cup. It was very strong and not very watery so it was gone real fast. I would not order that again... not worth 7 bucks.\n\nAt the end, we had some chocolate flutes rolled in powdered sugar and they weren't too sweet with dark chocolate on the inside. They also brought out a nice chocolate pudding out for our anniversary which was really nice. This place is very nice and romantic!! The service here is great!

However, there was nothing in the least bit tacky or cheesy about the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.\n\nThe elevator ride to the restaurant builds anticipation and a pristine, gorgeous open kitchen done up in white and copper greets you as you step off the elevator. Delicious smells and pastries on display hint at a delectable meal to come.\n\nThe atmosphere is perfect-moody reds and low lighting with spectacular views of the strip. Making a 5pm reservation guarantees a table near the windows, and the view of the Bellagio Fountains doing their choreographed dance was a reward for eating on the senior schedule (Though the 5pm timing did work perfectly in that it allowed for us to make Le Rev at 7pm at the Wynn without breaking a sweat). Seeing the fountains from above, in my opinion, was even more impressive as one could perceive the pattern of their movement in a different way.\n\nThe service was also stellar. Our waiter was attentive and present without being distracting or overbearing. He asked immediately if we had time constraints and worked to get us out with plenty of time, offering the souffle up front to ensure it was ready on time (I imagine they do this across the board, but I was psyched that he asked because I would have otherwise).\n\nAnd the food....Oh, the food! I typically do not eat much bread (Nutritionist, endurance events, blah blah), but the baguette was well worth the splurge. It was just the right amount of sweet, was perfectly soft and yet flaky all at once. I'm not sure I've had better bread in France! The hubby, who is typically even more nutrition conscious than I am, had two slices!\n\nI had the New York Steak and would have eaten every last bite, were I not saving room for dessert. It was the most perfect medium-well I've ever had, and the truffle sauce made it all the more delicious. I also sampled the crispy potatoes and the brussels sprouts. We joked that the potatoes we \"tots for grownups\" as they had a perfectly crispy shell but were the consistency of mashed potatoes inside. We may or may not have fought over the last one.The brussels sprouts, while not gaining points for health due to the fact that they are sauteed and served with bacon, were magically delicious. \n\nThe souffle was also perfect. We went with pistachio, which is certainly an unconventional choice, but it was remarkable. The nutty flavor of the pistachio balanced out the sweetness of the souffle. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is certainly a slice of la bonne vie.\n\nOne item to note: If you're male, make sure you're wearing a collared shirt. I had a great time picking on my husband who elected to wear a swanky sweater without a collared shirt and was asked to borrow a jacket to wear."

She said the waitress was not there yet and it'd be another 5 minutes until she would be so I needed to wait back by the front. Why I couldn't just sit at the table for 5 minutes instead of walking all the way back to the front still boggles by mind. Fine. After about 10 minutes, she sits me one table directly in front of the table she originally seated me at. I waited 10 minutes to get 1 table closer when all the tables in front of the window are open? Wow, thanks. She said those tables were unavailable but throughout the duration I was there, only 1 table got occupied. Lies.\n\nThe waitress was very pushy. From asking what cocktail we wanted instead of \"would you like a cocktail\" to asking which souffl\u00e9 we wanted before we ordered our appetizers because she informed us it would take 40 minutes to prepare. Okay, just chill for a second. I didn't see her again until dinner was over and she placed the dessert menus in front of me and my guests without ever inquiring if we wanted to see the dessert menu.

Waited 10-15 minutes for the side plates to be brought out.  By that time the souffl\u00e9 was cold.  Currently waiting another 20 minutes for another souffl\u00e9 to be cooked.  Not happy with the service or condition of the dinning area."

Being kinda hungry, we asked the gentleman standing near the Eiffel Tower elevators if the restaurant was open. And there is where our beautiful Sunday brunch begins. \n\nWe were seated immediately at a table that overlooked the Vegas strip. We were greeted by our server, Stephen, was extremely knowledgeable about the brunch menu and gave us a few moments to look over the menu while he brought us coffee & a bottle of Perrier. \n\nI ordered the French toast - brioche covered in carmelized bananas, pecans, whipped cream and served with a side of bacon. 'Bacon is good for me' - I don't order French toast very often but this was the best thing since sliced bread. My honey ordered the Eggs Benedict - a smaller portion that we expected, but very tasty with chorizo. \n\nThe food was excellent and the view itself makes the dining experience complete. I will definitely come back here again for brunch! It's reasonably priced (compared to their dinner menu), but like I said breakfast is the most important meal of the day ;)\n\nCheers!"

That being said, the reason that this is my first Yelp review, is because Las Vegas, to me, has proven to be such a mixed bag in regards to its' dining. It is extremely difficult to discern in any way other than a dining experience of your own, whether or not a restaurant is good, or merely another shiny tourist trap.\n\n My boyfriend and I dined here about a week and a half ago. Our experience was stellar. Every member of the staff that helped in providing us with one of the most pleasurable dining experiences we've ever had executed with decorum, class, and warm welcome. Our request to have a window seat was graciously accommodated, and the view of the strip and Bellagio fountains was beautiful. \n\nWe started with two delicious cocktails. Both very refreshing and inventive. Then we ordered our dinner. We had the crab salad, black pepper raw beef, beef wellington, and the flat iron steak (notice a pattern?), with mushroom spaetzle and creamed spinach. I won't lengthen this review by picking apart each dish. I must just say that every dish was EXCELLENT. The wellington was delicious in its' flaky pastry, the flat iron cooked perfectly. We paired out meal with a lovely Bordeaux. I wanted seconds of everything we ate, but needless to say (that due to the generous portions not usually associated with fine dining) I didn't even have room for dessert. \n\nOur server, Josh, was extremely attentive and had a great sense of humor. We never had to ask or wait for a single thing. At the end of the meal, he brought out a small assortment of petit fours, which was a pleasant surprise, because as full as I was, I have quite the sweet tooth and rarely skip dessert. We just booked our next trip to Vegas, which will be at the end of September...yay! I absolutely can not wait to come back and treat ourselves to another dinner at Eiffel Tower. (Or two)"

The service is very good and the view is awesome.\n\nWe started off with their cucumber lemonade. Great and refreshing, which was especially welcome after walking in the summer heat.\n\nThey give you a little amuse bouche with their parmesan rolls to start. I found the amuse bouche really interesting. I don't know what it was made of, but to me it tasted like peas - I love peas. Bread is really good too.\n\nWe then had some soups. My husband had the lobster soup with bay scallops and I went with the onion soup. They were both good, but definitely needed salt and pepper in our opinion. The onion soup is also not your typical french onion soup as this one is thinner and made with cream - also, it has no onion pieces.\n\nMy husband had the Moroccan lamb burger with potato chips. He thought that it was tasty (I only had the chips) and the little sauce they give you on the side is really good.\n\nI went with their parmesan crusted chicken. That was really tasty. It came accompanied by au gratin potatoes (tasty) and veggies (also tasty).\n\nAll, in all, it was a really good meal and was not as expensive as we thought it would be."

The view is great, and the ambiance is kinda fancy but not over the top. We really enjoyed the complimentary bread and butter, and they come around offering more bread which is hard to say no to.\n\nI've enjoyed a brunch menu which was $39, and came with a shrimp appetizer (2 pieces), salmon omelette (really good), and a yummy strawberry champagne ice cream that was a pretty decent size.  They also sometimes give complimentary candies or \"amuse bouche\" which i never heard of before until one time i went lol... like a little tiny appetizer before a meal.\n\nI would recommend the BLT sandwich.  I don't know that I would order anything too fancy or expensive, but to order a fun meal under $20 (like the BLT, or soup and salad),  I think the view is worth it.  The coffee is good but it's like $8!  So you can get a decent meal for not too expensive as long as you don't over order.... \n\nI've never had a problem with the service, they've always been friendly and attentive."

Niiiiiiice.\n\nHow do I put this?  The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is like that girl you knew in college that you'd see across the auditorium in PoliSci 103 that didn't really look 'all that' from afar so you didn't pay much attention to her.  That is, until your pal tells you that she was at the kegger the other night that you missed to study for your Stats final and it turns out she's kinda cool but deliberately hides her face in class, wears a Chargers jersey on the weekends, and can down 5 shots of Patron faster than that chick Marion from 'Raiders'.  \n\nSo you check her out just for yuks and you discover that she's actually immensely cool, really smart - heck, she's acing the class - on top of being about a solid '9' & you realize you've been a total dick for pre-judging her and wasting your time not getting to know her better.  But by then your sophomore year's over and she transfers to another UC, changes her digits, and you never see her again.  Ever!  \nDAMMMMMMMMIT!!!\n\nHmrph.. uh, where was I?\n\nTHE FOOD?  THE VIEW?\nOh yeah.  Food's good.  And the view's pretty awesome, what with the fountains and strip and all.  Your girl will definitely dig it.  This is classic French cuisine and eating here made me feel like I was cheating on Andre Rochat.  \nWe're eating French here, so you should know that the dishes will be small, right?  And you should go with classic French dishes, right?  Duck 2 Ways, Rack of Lamb, or Venison.  Fois Gras & Escargot.  And so here we go:\nDuck 2 Ways: 5/5 \nRack of Lamb: 5/5\nVenison: 4/5\nFois Gras: 5/5\nEscargot: 4/5\n(\"When in France...\" you eat French food, right?   So who the heck goes to a French restaurant & says, \"I'll have the seabass\"?  Cripes - would you like a bowl of Miso soup with that?)\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE?\nThis is for the most part, a really elegant, classy restaurant with prompt and formal service.  I did notice an interesting theme however - that service quality appeared proportional to one's dress, so consider yourself forewarned.  I came in a sportcoat, dress shirt & slacks. \n....Did you ever wonder why Andre Rochat, famous for his Las Vegas French cuisine, never built an \"Andre's\" or an \"Alize\" in the only French themed hotel in Vegas?  Well, it might have something to do with the LOUD, CLASSLESS JACKASSES & THEIR OFFSPRING THAT PERMEATE THE PARIS HOTEL.  If there's one item that does not belong in any fine dining establishment, it's a HIGH CHAIR.\n...I'm sorry, but I really can't ignore this point.  The food is quite good but the environment while I was dining, was downright teeth-grating at times.  I can see why they are enforcing a dress code.  Too bad it's not enough.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nFocus on the food.  Dodge the tourists, go on the off season, and get to know this beauty of a restaurant.  Lest she disappear, a victim of the Vegas economy and you never get your chance.\n\n4-stars.\n\n------------------\nINSIDER'S HINT:  LAST MINUTE RESERVATIONS\nThe place is the only joint that fills up with reservations at Paris.  If you get in late, and you can't get a reservation by calling into the direct line, go to http://www.opentable.com and try getting a reservation there.  Eiffel Tower is available on OpenTable which often can get you reservations when none are otherwise available because the restaurant has to \"keep a few seats open\" for the service."

The view was awesome and we never had empty glasses, maybe that was because they charged for the wine and water so empty means no money.\n\nWhile the food was good, it was not close to perfect.  The lobster appetizer that I had was a bit chewy, seemed a tad undercooked.  The salad was very good and the rack of lamb was excellent.  My only take with the main course was that there was not any starch with it.  A nice mashed potato or something would have made it much better.  I had the rack of lamb and it came with a slice of tomato and egg plant.  While it was good, it just seemed to be missing something.

They told me they couldn't guarantee my seat and said I should come early.\n\nI recommend parking with the valet service at Paris. Either you or your date will be wearing something nice and heels so you probably won't want to walk in those. The self parking lot is pretty darn far away (about a 7 minute walk) so skimping on the valet tip isn't worth it. \n\nWe got the following: \n\n+pea soup (6.5/10) Very distinct taste. Came with some fish which was very delicious. \n+foie gras (7/10) portion was very small but delicious. It was very flavorful but a bit on the salty side. \n+blue cheese souffle (7/10) Delicious. The souffle was scrumptious. \n+lamb chops (9/10) M girlfriend said this is the best lamp she's ever had. \n+chocolate souffle (9/10) Very delicious and full of chocolate flavor. Our server poked holes into the souffle and then pour chocolate syrup inside. \n+espresso\n\nOur total came out to $132.42. A great deal for a good view, fine dining and a relaxing atmosphere. \n\nI'd have to say the lamb was very delicious. My girlfriend said that it was the best lamb she's ever had. I thought it was pretty good myself. It was flavorful and not very gamy.  I read a few other reviews commenting that the lamb was a bit tough. My girlfriend and I like our meat rare so I asked the waiter to serve it as rare as they could get away with. \n\nThe blue cheese souffle was pretty good but not as good as the chocolate souffle. We ordered it early so we'd get it after our lamb chops. \n\nThe entire dinner was roughly 2 hours. I'd give yourself 2 hours if in case you're budgeting your time. We had a Cirque du Soliel to run to so we paced ourselves to leave in 1 hour and 45 minutes. \n\nWe sat at the very corner seat closest to the Bellagio fountains. We are from 700-900 and saw at least 5 fountain shows. I think this place has the best fountain shows. I'd definitely recommend this place for special occasions."

The stack of au gratin potatoes just sucked and they were cold and not seasoned well. My boyfriend asked for meat and cheese only on his burger and they gave him a burger with an entire side salad on that bitch and it was WAY burnt on one side.\n\nWe didn't dare tell our waiter our problems because he had his nose so far up in the air. He scoffed at me when I asked a valid question about the menu and rolled his eyes at almost everything we said.

We got to watch the water show and have a yummy meal! It was my favorite dining experience in all of Vegas! What a surprise!"

You're pretty much paying for the view. I am happy to be able to say I've ate there before, it was an experience I'll never forget; but if you're looking for amazing food for the same price, try the Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse downstairs."

We came not sure what to expect but what we got surpassed any possible expectations we couldve had. First and foremost the food was amazing. I had the Quail and she had the skirt steak. Both were delicious and rich in flavor. The portions weren't the biggest but it was so rich we were full anyway. \n\nIn terms of service the waiter we had was great. He was friendly and helpful and always checked up on us. He was very professional and did not reveal the surprise dessert for my girlfriend (he even neglected to tell me and i almost forgot). We also were seated right in front of the bellagio water show. \nFor dessert we were given a free chocolate mousse and we ordered the banana white chocolate tower thingie (i forget what its called). So because i put in the comment section of the online reservation that it was my girlfriend's birthday, they brought her a small chocolate mousse and surrounding the tiny shot glass of chocolate was Happy Birthday drizzled in chocolate. She was totally unaware this was going to happen and she had a huge smile on her face when it came. After that we decided to be bold and ordered the white chocolate banana dessert which was delicious. The presentation was awesome as well. The white chocolate is flattened and then bananas are thinly sliced and stacked in layers of chocolate then bananas. Of course its all drizzled in melted white chocolate and the top is covered with a caramelized sugar dome that was cool to look at and eat."

Nice place to kill some time (and money) while you wait for a table... window side views must be requested at time of checkin, so id recommend getting here early if thats what youre looking for. \n\nThe food: i ordered the roasted rack of lamb - done just right (at medium rare) and plated very elegantly (as one hopes/expects in a French restaurant  of this caliber). The tomato tart was not especially memorable and felt more like a garnish than a side. \n\nThe service was fine. Since the tables are close, I could tell our server basically had a script of things he said to each table which made him feel a little impersonal, but he was friendly and attentive. Maybe since this is a French place impersonal is what they are going for for authenticity?\n\nFor the desert we ordered a chocolate souffle, as our waiter said these were \"famous\" at this restaurant. Maybe I'm not a souffle type guy, as to me it just kind of tasted of hot chocolate in a solid form - which i suppose is not a bad thing if you love hot chocolate.\n\nAll in all, a great place and not 'hokey' at all despite it's location which was my worry. It's legit fine dining restaurant for sure, but for my money doesn't rank in the strip's top tier."

When we rode the elevator up, we were greeted by the kitchen! Haha, how cool, well I think it's cool, okay? \n\nWe got there early so we wandered around a bit.  The view was pretty awesome! I loved being able to see Bellagio and Ceasar's Palace on such a beautiful sunny day.\n\nWe were seated and our waiter John came to help us out and all.  He was really nice, made some small talk in between bringing our menus, drinks and food to us.  I really liked that.  I would definitely have a waiter who is more social than one who just brings us food.  And we found out we had some stuff in common too! \n\nAnyways...on to the food:\nI ordered an open faced smoked salmon sandwich. My mom got crab french toast while my dad got an open faced flat iron steak sandwich.  Ah and a lobster bisque and a cucumber lemonade.\n\nUnfortunately, my favorite part of the meal was the amuse bouches.  It was a shitake mushroom custard (? er something similar to one) Gosh it was SO GOOD.  Creamy, light and a lovely earthy deep mushroom flavor.  Then these cheese rolls, I believe there was parmesan inside.  It was crispy on the outside, soft, chewy cheesy on the inside.  There were two kinds, one topped with fresh black pepper and the other with fennel seeds. Yumm!\n\nSorry this review is getting long, I wonder if anyone reads reviews this long.\nI enjoyed my entree.  Smoked salmon had a nice flavor and the crispy brioche on the bottom was nice.  And the flavors worked well, The lobster bisque was frothy, light, had almost a seawater and lobster taste to it. I really liked it! The cucumber lemonade was very refreshing.  My mom's crab french toast was alright.  I liked the crab meat inside, but maybe a bit too much egg on the outside.  And my dad's steak was nice, a good medium and had a great flavor.\n\nPhew my fingers are tired, hope you're eyes aren't too tired.  I do recommend checking this place out for lunch if you don't want to spend as much on dinner."

The sommelier introduced himself and helped us pick out a reasonably priced Cote du Rhone. The prices are pretty steep here, but the wine list is a little out of control! \n\nWe started with a salad and a delicious salmon dish. I'm glad we began with small plates, as my lamb main course was just spectacular, although an enormous portion. The pricing on the meat dishes seemed somewhat alright when I ordered, until I realized that sides need to be ordered separately. My potato au gratin was well worth the extra cash though.\n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate souffle which they decorated with a \"happy birthday\" in chocolate sauce on the plate. The dinner was leisurely and absolutely wonderful. Was glad I didn't have to pick up the tab, but if someone else is paying it's worth the trip!"

I've been to Paris, and I've been to the top of Eiffel Tower, and although it is not the same spiritual experience I felt in France, it was still wonderful. My bf told me he got the recommendation from a guy he was sharing a poker table with as they were discussing french food. The guy told him he has taken his wife here every year for their anniversary. And let's just say after eating here, I really had to go back and re-evaluate all the 5-star places I've reviewed. I would never take back a star or anything but every venue after this has a standard to meet. lol.\n\nVENUE: \nThe restaurant is at the top of Paris Hotel and Casino, with amazing ceiling-to-floor windows that allow you to have a view overlooking the strip. We were taken up via elevator and once you first enter you pass the kitchen - all white tile, very French-looking kitchen. A bit tacky I thought at first, but on my way out, I realized how clever they were in doing that (it was probably unintentional but whatever), because as soon as you enter the dining area you are floored. The atmosphere is romantic and intimate. Perfect place in Vegas date night/dinner so make sure you take someone on whom, you find worth spending the money. Go during the evening - after 8 PM when the Bellagio does its fountain shows every 15 minutes you'll enjoy the view. Overall we spend ~$250. Worth every penny...that the bf spent. \n\nFOOD/DRINK:\nDRINKS:\nI started off my evening with the house Bordeaux. Now, I'm not a sommelier and I don't think myself a vino or anything, but I thought this red was delicious. The server told me it would be dry, but I didn't find that to be the case at all. When I think of dry I think of Merlots but this was fantastic. The bf got their (the name escapes me) drink with the raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries in it. It was delicious and is served with a spoon so you don't have to worry trying to tilt the glass upward at the end to get the fruit.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\nRoasted Foie Gras, Marinated Grapes, Julienne Cr\u00eapes: Oh my goodness. For such a tiny portion, it sure packed a punch. It was PHENOMENAL. The pate melted in my mouth and also went well with the bread that served.\n\nRack of Lamb, served Medium: Oh lawd. Delicious. Tender, juicy meat that literally fell off the bone once you put your fork in it. \nBeef Wellington, served Medium Rare: Let me tell you, I've had some pretty darn good beef wellington in my life and this was scrumptious. The beef was also tender and juicy and the pate surrounding it was a great seletion. \nDESSERT:\n\nStrawberry Souffle. I can't even. It wasn't super sugary sweet which I loved. The flavors of the strawberry really came out, and eventhough I was STUFFED by the time dessert came out, I didn't feel guilty eating the souffl\u00e9 at all. The texture was marshmellowy but didn't feel heavy at all. It was amazing.\n\nSERVICE:\nWe were orginially sat at a table to the side of the restaurant but wanted a better view of the Bellagio (who wouldn't?) and asked to be moved. The hostess was accomodatnig and understanding and were re-sat in a matter of 5 minutes. Not bad for a 7PM, Saturday night reservation. We sprung for the photo - and although I feel bad for the other yelpers that got blurry ones, ours came out really well. And being a photo whore, the photogapher let me review what she had taken and took a few to make sure I was satisfied. Our server was funny and helpful and courteous. He made sure to ask us about dessert before our entrees came out - which was mindful since we had a 9:30PM show to catch. We took our time and paid with minutes to spare as we walked to the Monte Carlo afterwards."

First of all, the line to get in/check into the restaurant was huge and it was extremely hard to move around the reception area.  The girls who worked at the check-in station looked very stressed and overwhelmed.  It took us another 30 minutes to get to our table after we have arrived. The menu for Valentine's was pre-set which was a huge disappointment because it was not special at all and at $165 per person it was simply ridiculous. The food was very random. Service was not good either, food came very late, people didn't get their orders at the same time and it took 5 attempts until we finally were allowed to get some bread which came with attitude when someone asked for an extra piece.  Bottom line, all 10 of us were very disappointed with the whole experience and it was not at all what one would expect at $600 per couple (with wine/drinks that's what it came out to).  Can't recommend it and we are not coming back there for sure."

Me and my three friends made reservations for a Monday night at around 6pm on 2/11/13. When we got up there, you have to take the elevator up to the restaurant, then walk through their kitchen area, which is really neat to see. They gave us a side view of the Bellagio fountains and the rest of the strip (which is an amazing view). It is a very classy place, and they serve you multiple choice of bread which are all excellent. It's a pricy place, but no pricer than your going to get anywhere else on the strip. I got the FIlet Mignon with B\u00e9arnaise sauce, which was very good, just not great. Also got the Caesar salad, however, the dressing tasted 100% oil, and not like caesar at all, which was probably my least favorite thing here. Also got a Apple strudel dessert which was very flavorful with cinnamon sugar and nice flaky crust. \n\nPROS\n*Atmosphere - #1 reason to come here. Might be the nicest place to dine in the heart of the strip. At night it's beautiful because not only do you get a great view of the Bellagio fountains, but the strip in general. \n\n*Service - I really enjoyed how it felt like we didn't have a waiter, but we had a host. Everyone was really nice and very accommodating. The waitress always came over and refilled our water glasses and they constantly asked us if we wanted more of that fresh bread. \n\nCONS\n*Food - Food is still really good, just nothing amazing to the point I was blown away. I personally think Ruth's Chris or Morton's food is better than here.\n\n*Price - Not outrageous for Las Vegas, but still a pricy place. For a Caesar Salad, Filet Mignon, and a dessert cost me in the neighborhood of $100."

(Don't book at Lutece, kids, unless you either know the owner personally or you want to take a chance on your reservation that was made two weeks previously  getting suddenly cancelled a few hours before dinner.)  I was a little nervous to eat at the Eiffel Tower because the idea of a restaurant on top of a fake Eiffel in Vegas seemed awfully touristy-Disneyland rather than the nice, elegant dinner we wanted to have, but we didn't have a lot of options given how late Lutece pulled the rug out from under us.  \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised by how nice the dinner and the service were at the Eiffel Tower.  Our table had a nice view of the Bellagio fountain.  We had the tasting menu, which was good, and a lot of good (not spectacular, but definitely well above average) food.  The overall dining experience was very pleasant.  My only complaints were (1) it took a really long time for them to bring the next course from time to time, which was a little weird as the restaurant was not that full at the hour we went, so this isn't a place to eat if you're in a hurry; and (2)  if you got the tasting menu it had to be for two people, and one of us might have wanted something different, but went along with the other one of us who wanted tasting menu.  I don't see what the big deal is in preparing it for one person, as much of it seemed to be little bits of premade food that was just cooked and dressed up with sauce, but whatever.\n\nAs this is a fancy place we were a little taken aback to see a family come in and sit next to us who weren't exactly dressed up to the nines and acted like they just got off the train from Podunk (talking loud, asking stupid questions about the menu, etc.) but it is Las Vegas, there are going to be tourists.  However, the tables aren't jammed together in this restaurant, so it  wasn't like the Clampetts came and sat in our lap, and we were able to largely ignore them.  \n\nThe restrooms are very nice and have nice, well-mannered attendants.  \n\nOverall,  a nice and not too \"touristy\" dining experience."

We were a party of 6 and our food took an hour to arrive. In the interim we just sat and waited...the waiter did not check in and we had to ask for our water to be refilled. The food was really overpriced. I don't mind paying for great food but $60 for bland Muscovy duck and $70 for really undercooked lamb was just disappointing. \nWe all thought it's typical Vegas prices but we went to the Foundation Room for dinner the next night and it was a complete pleasure."

All the reviewers have already mentioned the spectacular view esp with the Bellagio fountain light show, but keep in mind that they will stop the show if it gets too windy (and it gets windy in vegas all the time).  \n\nThe food is good.  We had the froe gras which was good (but not as good as I expected) and I had the rack of lamb which was very yummy.  My gf has the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection as well.  Their souffle is good and it has so many flavors to choose from (Chocolate, Grand Marnier, Pistachio, Banana and more).  \n\nTheir wine list is very extensive and very reasonably priced I thought.  This is one of the few restaurants that server one of my favorite \"cheaper\" cab that I like (Justin's Orphan)"

We were expecting drinks and fancy French food but what we got was so much more!  \n\nOur waiter, Mauricio, was really awesome.  He chatted with us about his world travels, his previous careers, his future fiance and his favorite foods/drinks.  He paired each course with a drink or glass of wine and was spot on with his pairings.  I had the avocado with fresh crab appetizer and it was paired with a riesling.  Excellent.  Then, the walnut and artichoke crepes with a fresh berry house cocktail.  Delicious!  Finally, a Pomegranate Italian-style margarita with some chocolates made on-site.  Fantastic!!!\n\nWe could not have asked for a better welcome on our first day in Vegas.  Yes, we ended up spending a small fortune for a total of 8 drinks, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees, but I couldn't be happier as I left and promptly took a nap.\n\nWill definitely be back, probably our first stop for the next trip!\n\nP.S.

            "review": "I have two sets of comments here, one for the general public, and the other for the truly discriminating foodie.\n\nFirst, if you're looking for a lovely dining experience, you won't be disappointed.  Everything that came out of the kitchen was presented beautifully, the pacing was good, the ambiance, lovely.  Probably 'nuff said here, but if you're a foodie, read on.\n\nI have to lead with the wired, Secret Service earpieces the waitstaff sported.  As you exit the elevator, you're facing the state of the art kitchen, and beehive efficient staff.  If you have lead time on your reservation, do request a table overlooking the Bellagio's fountains.  It's a mesmerizing view.  Casual diners, stop here.  Foodies, read on.\n\nNow for the prix fixe.  98 pp for the meal, an additional 69 pp for the wine pairings, and if you're dining as a couple, you will both need to opt in. \n\nThe amuse bouche was the prelude, and consisted of an onion vichyssoise with a white fish top that was divine.  After this there were three petits of smoked salmon, foie gras, and mushroom streudel.  The foie gras was served atop an almost meringue-light crouton, but it was still too much bread to balance the foie gras. \n\nFrom there off to the first course - a lobster salad over cucumber papaya relish, paired with a Feuillatte blush champagne.  This is, of course, where my palate first deviates from the sommelier's, as I didn't find the blush, well, necessary.  I would have been perhaps happier with a light champagne or chardonnay/chablis sparkling.  Lobster, in my opinion, should always be the star of the show. \n\nThe next course was the butternut squash bisque, and that pairing was literally too close for comfort.  No, really, the Pinot Gris was astoundingly similar to the soup.  In this case, I would have looked for a little more contrast.  The soup was quite wonderful.\n\nSea bass was served next, over a bed of smoky tomato quinoa that was nothing short of brilliant (the quinoa; not the bass, which I actually found a little leathery and over-done.)  A quintessentially Russian River chardonnay was served; I would have gone for something un-oaked and less buttery.\n\nI love it when a restaurant *knows* how the beef should be cooked; just a few degrees shy of medium rare.  Paired with the perfect Ferrari-Carano blend, these tiny prime beef roulades were absolutely top-notch.  Prime beef roulade, horseradish mousseline and a nod to brussels sprouts\n\nI can't comment on the dessert wine, as they are not to my taste, and beyond my scope. Clos Uroulat.\n\nWhat I can tell you is to scratch the apple streudel with cinnamon ice cream right off your list of considerations - the pastry was tough enough to need a knife, and the filling, totally forgettable.  Way too heavy-handed on the raw sugar as well.   By contrast, however, the White Chocolate Banana Elysium (I believe they called it), was a work of art (photo attached).\n\nIf you got to the end of this whole review, without thinking I'm  certifiable, you better link to me.  I want to read your reviews, too.\n\nOverall, the restaurant experience was excellent, and someplace I could recommend without hesitation.\n\nBon Appetit!"

The food was terrible!!! \nWe paid $140 per person for 9 family members (do the math and then add 20% gratuity plus tax ) to celebrate our daughters birthday...which also happens to be Valentine's Day. I get it, the whole idea of a pre-set menu, it's all about feeding the masses, quantity over quality. But for that price you expect quality! The filet was tough and needed a hack saw to cut into it. I chose the sea bass. What a joke! I've had sea bass many times. It's thick and meaty. This was the thinnest puny piece of fish I've ever had that claimed to be \"sea bass\". Simply put, I'd expect this type of cheap cuts of meat & subpar side dishes at a buffet for $29. Not $140. \nThe wait staff however,was 5 stars!! They were polite, attentive, and overall just very professional. I couldn't find a negative if I tried. So if you don't mind dropping a ton of money on the \"experience\" go for it. If you actually enjoy good food, skip this place altogether."

The food was great, and the service was superb!\n     Definitely a good idea to make reservations, this place gets packed!  We started off with the cold foie geas and blue cheese souffle, both were decent but not outstanding.  The blue cheese souffle reminded me of bread pudding, it tasted okay but wasnt anything special.  The cold foie gras was a tad salty even with bread, I think the seared foie gras might have tasted better.   The bread selection was good, I liked the french baguette.  Our bread came out cold, so the waiter gladly brought us hot bread on the spot!  \n     My friends ordered entrees of salmon, sea bass, duck breast, and lamb chops.  The seafood dishes were okay, nothing to rave about.  The grilled duck breast was excellent!  The grilled lamb chops were by far the best ive ever had!  It came out tender, juicy, and had no gamey flavor at all!  It had the texture of a filet mignon and taste of a prime rib, which was quite unique...definitely a great entree!  \n     We ordered two souffles, a pistachio and banana nut...both were great!  The souffles came out hot, super light, perfect texture..by far the best souffles ive ever had!  The banana nut tasted excellent!  The pistachio souffle was also unique, both were very tasty!  I'd come back here just for the souffles..and they are so light that you can eat two of them by yourself!\n    Overall, the service here is excellent, all the waiters are super nice and constantly check up to make sure everything is satisfying.  The food was perfect, but the portions were on the small side.  The souffles are amazing, definitely a must-have!  Prices here a little high, especially for such small portions, but everything was cooked perfect and presented nicely!  This would be a perfect spot to take a date, nice cozy and dimly lit place with a romantic feel, and great views of the strip, including the bellagio water show."

            "review": "The Eiffel Tower Restaurant sits on the 11th floor of the Paris' Eiffel Tower replica in Las Vegas; it provides a decor, atmosphere and dining experience that is fitting with its name (which you may either enjoy or find cheesy depending on your likes/dislikes).\n\nA private glass elevator takes guests up to the restaurant (kind of an interesting view of floors and activity on the way up and the way back down).  The elevators opens up to the kitchen where the chefs plate the food.\n\nThe restaurant utilizes an old-fashioned dining room--plush red seating and white tablecloth--but the stodginess of it is cut dramatically by the view and utilization of the Eiffel Tower's metal legs within the restaurant.\n\nThe tables are strategically placed so that many tables have a great view of The Strip (with the primary attraction being the Bellagio Fountains).  Lots of big floor-to-ceiling windows create the great view.  The metal framework cuts into the restaurant and it gives it kind of an art deco feel.  The art deco feel with the old-fashioned decor really make this place feel like a restaurant from another era.\n\nThey started us off with a cream soup amuse bouche that was okay but not great.  The complimentary bread was also okay but not memorable.\n\nWe had some appetizers.  The lobster Pain Perdu was kind of like a lobster bread souffle.  It was okay though not great.  We also had some sea scallops that were served in a wine sauce with onions.  The scallops dish was also just okay.  The scallops were tender and seasoned right.  I've had much better though in terms of scallops (both in outside sear and moistness) as well as the accompanying sauces and sides.\n\nWe also had a little bit of their cold seafood platter, which included lobster, shrimp, crab, oysters, and clams.  This is not my favorite type of starter (I would rather have hot seafood where the chefs get a little more creative in how they garnish/sauce/cook the seafood).  Everything was okay, but nothing really stood out here.\n\nI had the venison chop as my entree.  The venison chop had a nice red color, but it was not that juicy.  The meat was tender enough and had a decent though not spectacular flavor.  The huckleberry reduction sounded good, but it did not really do much here (not a particularly prominent flavor on the plate).\n\nThe main side to the venison chop was an oatmeal cake.  This is the second time I've had oatmeal with dinner (the other time was Bistro LQ).  This would not be my favorite side--not bad (definitely tastes like oatmeal).  The plate also featured black trumpet mushrooms and these were pretty good.  They had a nice crunch to them.\n\nI also tried one of the a la carte slides--classic potato gratin.  It was kind of lukewarm.  The potatoes were tender but a little bland (and lacked a creamy cheesy flavor).\n\nWhile almost all of the food was average, the dessert was a real winner.  I had the chocolate souffle and it was probably one of the best chocolate souffles I've had.  It had a great chocolate flavor (they served it with a chocolate ganache, which was also good).  What separated the chocolate souffle was the texture.  Very nicely baked.  Great texture and great lift.  Chocolate souffles are hard to get right.  They are typically dry, spongy or liquidy.  This one though was pretty close to perfect.\n\nI also had some vanilla ice cream, which was creamy but pretty standard stuff.\n\nService was good in terms of getting the food out at a good pace even though the restaurant was incredibly busy (which also caused the restaurant to be quite warm and loud).  I felt though that the waiter was not as good as some of the other waiters I've had recently.  He did a good enough job, but I felt he was a little stuffy.  I think he could have been a little more personable and relaxed.\n\nLas Vegas restaurants are typically overpriced and Eiffel Tower Restaurant is a pretty good example of that.  The food here would be in the same price range as some of the most expensive and best restaurants in L.A.  Even when comparing Eiffel Tower Restaurant to other pricey Vegas restaurants, Eiffel Tower Restaurant still feels very overpriced.  The prices here are similar to Mesa Grill, but the flavors at Mesa Grill are much better (Mesa Grill uses better ingredients too).\n\nEiffel Tower Restaurant makes a great souffle and I would come back for that.  The food, however, is overpriced and average (despite having the backing of prominent chef Jean Joho, who also operates the Michelin starred Everest in Chicago).  Even though I am not a big fan of Las Vegas restaurants, I think you could do much better on The Strip than Eiffel Tower Restaurant.\n\nI walked here, but I imagine they have complimentary valet parking or self-parking like the other big Vegas casinos."

The drinks, like everything else were overpriced but really delicious and well made.  After a few sips our table was ready and we were seated right in the front by the window.  The views are totally worth the expensive food.  You can see the strip lights, watch all the happenings from above and see the fountain show across the street.

The only view we saw was the blue Paris balloon sign and a little of Bellagio. Again, not impressive. My cousin and I ordered a chicken dish, and the BF's ordered fillet mignon. We also ordered mash potatoes on the side since the dishes did not come with anything but the meat itself. Once our dishes came out, like typical French food, the portions looked like they were meant to be eaten for birds. The fillet mignon was soooo tiny and mind you this dish cost $68 and each side dishes was $8. My chicken was \"organic and grown on a special farm\" so this explains why it was $38??? The only thing I enjoyed was their desserts. They were absolutely delicious! We had the White Chocolate Banana Elyse and the Raspberry Napoleon, Vanilla Blanc Manger. They had a beautiful presentation, so pretty to eat. Altogether as a group we spent $400 something including drinks and tip. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying a lot of money for a great dinner, but this was not a great dinner! Sorry, I will never return!"

It's expensive but you should know that prior to coming. \n\nUpon exiting the elevator you enter what looks like the kitchen area and it smells amazing. You can see chefs (or people dressed up as chefs) walking around preparing food and other items. The seating area gives you an excellent view of the Caesars Palace front water area and the Bellagio dancing fountains. That back drop makes for an amazing dinning experience. \n\nWe went with a larger group and they were very accommodating. Our serveur (waiter) was very nice to us and explained some of the stuff that was foreign without making us feel dumb. He provided us with a very nice champagne to help us toast a very special occasion. The desserts were over the top good and helped top off a great experience."

She checked the ingredients carefully to make sure I am safe. But I was expecting that they can accommodate my allergy more seriously because when I called to make a reservation, they told me that they are able to accommodate the allergy. However, I cannot eat anything on the tasting menu, and 2/3 of their regular menu. According to that, the experience at Chicago Everest is way better than here.\n\nWe ordered king crab leg as our appetizer, cheese plate, salmon, and snapper filet. I am satisfied with the food we ordered. Just feel a bit disappointed that the initial order of duck breast and steak and most of the food are not ok for me. Those were pre-made already. For the reputation of the chef, I expected more, that's why I only gave this place 4 star."

Perfect fo Anniversarries, birthdays any special occassion,  It makes the ocassion very memorable. But i'll make up any excuse to my fiancee just to go back there again.. lols \n\n2.AWESOME SERVICE. Our server paid very much attention to us. Even got a Complimentary Chocolate Dessert from them, the chef put it on a plate and wrote HAppy Anniversarry on the edges of the plate. It was so beautiful. It made us feel so special..\n\nWe don't drink and unfortunately they don't serve any unalcoholic drink but we told him we wanted something just for a toast and surely after a few minutes he came back with a couple of flutes, though I dont recall what it was called his effort to get us something they dont serve is outstanding.\n\nService is FAST too., unlike other fine dining restaurants which takes 30 minutes to get your food done.\n\n3.REASONABLE Price for a fine dining restaurant with a great view. We paid the same thing at Sutro's in SF and Sutro's food wasnt even as good.\n\n4.EXCELLENT FOOD! make sure you try their FOI GRAS with grilled grapes... yummy.., it melts in your mouth.\n\n5.The only thing is that tables are kind of close to one another so you actually hear the conversations from the other tables., But we got one of the best tables right infront of the Bellagio Fountain so were Happy nonetheless..\n\nWould Definitely be back there Again next visit!!! :)"

You take an elevator up and the views are fabulous. It was very impressive!\n\nThe food is just melt-in-your-mouth amazing, the service is top notch without being stuffy, and they really went above and beyond to make it a very special night. We were continually brought bread, waters refilled, and even given a great tasting cauliflower soup (sounds a little weird but tasted awesome), compliments of the chef. The food was delicious and the service was exceptional. The waitress was so on top of her game, it was probably the best service we ever had. She was great, yet wasn't stuffy -- she was very personable and made us feel comfortable. When my mom made the reservations, she asked them to include roses on the table. They had a dozen of the most beautiful red roses ever -- they are seriously perfect and still thriving! I got to take them home in the vase, and the waitress provided a great gift bag to make carrying them out easier. The are full and open, still looking and smelling as beautiful today as they did this past weekend at the restaurant! She also brought out a birthday dessert, in addition to the delicious souffle that my mom loved. My mom also asked them to bring out a jewelry gift she had gotten me, with dessert -- they brought it out on a platter and had written Happy Birthday on the plate. They didn't skimp on anything here -- everything was fabulous! It was the greatest dining experience and they helped my mom make my birthday truly special and unforgettable!"

And for a French restaurant, this place is neither \"overly French\" in that uppity manner, and the food is ripe for any palate, although, yes, the portions aren't huge. The foods are very flavorful though, and don't require large portions; in that true French fashion, the food is rich and luxurious in your mouth.  I'd recommend you try something completely new for you, be it the escargot, the foie gras, or even just something fancy that you can't pronounce. And don't forget dessert!

I must say I was really disappointed.\nI gave 2 stars just for the views and for the amazingly delicious souffl\u00e9, which by the way cost $15 each.\nI was not impressed by the phone manner of the person taking the reservation or the front hostesses. For a restaurant of this caliber, I would expect more courteous attitude. What I don't get is that I called 45 minutes before my dinner reservation time to see if I can move it up 1/2 hour. What I get in response is that they cannot change my reservation but I am welcome to arrive earlier to see if they would sit me. What kind of response is that? You either tell me that no tables were available or change my time. Upscale restaurants would not let their patrons wait if they have a reservation. We ended up arriving 10 minutes earlier, and even though I see a lot of empty tables, the hostess asked us to step aside and said we were early and that they would sit us at exactly 7pm. I was a bit turned off already. I was even more disappointed when even after both reservation taker and the waiter asked if we were celebrating any special occasion and we told them about our anniversary, nothing happened. Most restaurants would do something special with our desserts, but not this one.\nAs for the food, the steak was ok but not worth $59. The lamb chops was good, but the Dover Sole was disappointing. It was pretty hard as I couldn't eat it without cutting it with a knife. At $69, I would expect better. I had it switched to salmon. It was better, but nothing to write home about.\nThe strangest thing is the kids menu. I specifically asked and was told at reservation that there is a kids menu. When we sat down, there was none. I asked the waiter and at first he said that the kind of upscale restaurant that they are they don't really recommend the kids menu. I pressed further and he said the portion is too small for older kids, just for little ones under 5. My kids are 9 and 5. He cannot honestly expect me to order an adult entree for my 5-year-old! I ended up ordering pasta for my little one and the portion was just fine!\nWith the kind of money we spent on this dinner, I could've easily gone to other restaurants in the area that offer better food and service. I just don't get the high ratings from other Yelpers."

We made a reservation around sunset thinking it would be extra romantic. We got there on time (5:15pm) and were seated shortly thereafter. Our server was nice but not super friendly but the hostess was very rude and, for a lack of better words, snobby. We were given a window seat which we were happy with but the tables are small and extremely close together so your elbows bump with your neighbor when using utensils which is silly considering that we are both fairly small people. We both ordered a steak; I the New York and my husband the filet, both $59 a piece. I ordered mine medium which arrived VERY well done and my husband ordered his medium-rare which came out medium-well. Only one side of each steak was seasoned and both contained far too much fat for the cuts. The entrees do not include any sides so we shared an order of potatoes Gratin which had no flavor and the consistency if mayonnaise. There was zero opportunity to express our disappointment with our meal since our waiter seemed to disappear after the food was delivered to the table. All in all, the meal wasn't terrible but it was far from what I would have expected from one of the nicest restaurants in the area."

Overlooks the Strip and the recurring water show below, which partially explains why the Eiffel Tower may push past the price envelope, at times. Or maybe this is just Vegas, done in style. Regardless, when you're here, enjoy yourself and celebrate all things good.\n\nOne reason to come here was the Chef had created Brasserie Jo, in Chicago, one of my favorite places ever.\n\nDo ask for a window seat when you approach the Hostess stand. Repair at the swanky and luxurious bar as they make your table ready. Take in the room now, because soon you'll be looking out onto the beautiful vista -- as well as at your beautiful dining companion. And when food begins to arrive, you will want to gaze deeply into the works of art that wait demurely on your plates.  \n\n*Maine Lobster Salad, Watermelon Tartar, Water Chestnuts, Pistachio Vinaigrette is a delightful starter. Fresh, light and substantial all at once.\n\n* Warm Caesar a la Francaise, Capers, Garlic was not entirely satisfying. Though the Romaine confidently snapped and crunched beautifully, the *warm* part was absent. True, we had the dressing on the side. But the atypical Caesar dressing came room temp at best. My dining companion spotted our salad waiting on a table or stand nearby for several minutes before it got delivered by a backwaiter/busboy. Halfway into the salad we informed our server about the temperature problem. He apologized but made no efforts to remedy the situation there and then, nor later at the time of the bill. \n\nWhile debating which entrees to try, I thought our server gilded the lily saying how rare it is to see dishes like Dover Sole and the Beef Wellington on a menu. I saw them both offered at Mon Ami Gabi.\n\n*Sea Bass, Shaved Asparagus, Quinoa Gallette, Champagne Brown Butter Broth was appreciated by my dining companion -- though I felt it to be far too lemony, and fairly mundane. Adequate, but not thrilling.\n\n*Boneless Organic Rabbit, Braised Carrots Confits, Mustard Jus, however, I thought was Outstanding! The description relies on the verbal, though, and here our server got it just right. While half the dish is simply (and perfectly), the second part was a a more complex sausage made from the loin mixed with some vegetables -- so flavorful. Highly recommended. The carrots (haha) were delicious too. \n\n*Chocolate Souffle was a perfect ending. While someone here on Yelp grumbled it was small -- I think it was just right. I love a great Chocolate Souffle and when it's not great, I tell the restaurant there and then. This was great.\n\nWe muddled a bit over wine choices, and our server wasn't a great help. Maybe because they were busy, but we fairly soon enough got a nice visit from the Sommelier who steered us to a lovely White Bordeaux. We began the night with some fun cocktails off the Drink List. And we ended with excellent coffee and a latte.\n\nWe loved the bread selection and the re-appearance of the gent who delivered them. A different guy, alas, dropped my salad utensils on me as they slipped off the plate. Also, when we sat down and were asked about the water, still or sparkling -- it would have been appropriate to mention bottled or not. Not the end of the world, but a teensy bit presumptuous. The not-so-warm Caesar, the bobbling busboy contributed to this being a four not five star review. Still, it was a fabulous dinner."

We ordered 2 souffle desserts, a chocolate and a Grand Marnier.  The chocolate was the clear winner, however I don't think we would order these again.\n\nThe view leaves some to be desired.  The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is not at the top of the tower, it's on the equivalent of the 5th floor.  The windows are level with the top of the water from the Bellagio when the water show shoots up as high as it can.  The perimeter of the restaurant is comprised of tables for two which have panoramic views of the Las Vegas strip.  The center of the restaurant has larger tables for those that aren't on romantic dates."

Wonderful view, we had our dinner at 8pm reservation on a Saturday night and by that time, you get to watch the fountain show every fifteen minutes! \n\nI ordered one of the tasting menu they offered. In fact, it's their proposal package! Comes with a bottle of champagne, a dozen of roses, personalized menu, photo in a frame...\n\nHad an amazing time here! \n\nThe only mistake they made was they sat me at the wrong table, then asked me to go back to wait. But they were smart and gave us two free cocktails while we came back out to wait real quick.\n\nService was very good as well. The staff were very attentive with us throughout. \n\nFood was good as we expected. Didn't expect any less from this restaurant. \n\nIf you google more about the restaurant, you will see a PDF file for special dinner or lunch menu and a proposal package.  Pricing range from $250-10,000 depending on what you are trying to do."

Needless to say.. we loved it so much that the price didn't bother to us. The view was so beautiful especially sitting right in front of the bellagio and watching the watershow.. was unforgettable and amazing to experience. other info~~~ bread was so.. perfect and PERFECT! souffle was.. delish.. BUT don't get the caramel (i got that and regretted it) my dad got the chocolate which was SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD~! and my grandma got the pistachio which was eh~ and don't spill anything! because even a bread crumb will have your server coming to swipe it with a silver scooper thing. my brother spilled the creamed spinach and our server had to scrape that off too before my brother even got to eat it. they also give you new utensils for each course. omgosh omgosh one more thing.. i almost never eat butter or margarine unless it's made with a dish. but i just spread a hint of their butter on my french baguette and ended up eating half of the butter square which was huge. so light and perfect just the way i like it.\n\nat the end of our meal, we didn't even feel full. The portions were just right, but if you're looking for a hearty meal like my younger brother.. do what he did and get yourself a pan of pizza afterwards!\n\ni have pictures.. will upload asap~!"

Also, the drinks are hella expensive and not too special. A mixed drink runs you $16-22 - same for glasses of wine. I had the Bubbles and Sparks, and it was terrible. If you get fruit juice, it's only $5-7 per glass, but it's mostly ice.\n\nThe waitstaff is super friendly and the atmosphere is chi-chi, but come here to eat, not to lounge."

My wife ordered the \"Queen\" Filet Mingon and I had the Rack of Lamb all accompanied by the Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes.  The best cuts of meat by far.  It was all fantastic.  The filet was crusted wonderfully and the lamb was tender and juicy.  Oh my!!!  For dessert, Grand Marnier Soufle'. Another \"OH MY\".  To die for.  Once it was all done they brought out to us a small dessert plate celebrating our 1st anniversary."

Again, her chicken was good, but my stuffed baked lobster tail was unchallenged! Hands down, the best meal I had in Vegas this trip and trust me, we had A LOT of meals.. Lol. The service was what you expect from a high end restaurant with an older gent dressed in a sharp tux attending to our every need. \n\nI've been going to Vegas at least once a year for some time now.

The hostesses, server, and wait staff were all extremely friendly and courteous!  \n\nView/Ambiance: 5 stars\nThe view is amazing.  We even got a seat right next to the window directly in front of the Bellagio and a view of the Strip.  You can't beat that!  It's a very romantic place. In fact, one couple beside us got engaged right while we were dining and the one on the other side had just gotten engaged earlier that day!\n\nFood:  4 1/2 stars \nThe food was good, too.  The starter was the fennel mousseline, which was surprisingly interesting and good as we'd both never had a mousseline before.  We both started with the Market Greens salad, which was very good. The dressing was really amazing!  My husband opted for the halibut upon the recommendation of the server.  He enjoyed it so much that I didn't get to taste it.  I went with the filet mignon, which I requested to be cooked medium, although we both thought it was slightly overdone (more like medium-well with only a slight hint of pink in the center).  We also ordered the Asparagus with Brown Butter.  I found this to be only okay.  We each finished with the pistachio souffle, which was perfectly light, fluffy and enjoyable.    \n\nOverall, our experience was great.

But TOTALLY worth it. \n\nI loved everything about this place, and was so, so, so glad we decided to splurge here on our last night in Vegas. With no Res, we came up the elevator, gave our names and only had to wait about 15 minutes at the bar before we had a seat. The bartender was hilarious & sweet, and the hostess carried our wine over and seated us in a large, plush booth. \n\nThe view = incredible. This place is mid-way up the faux Eiffel Tower, facing the Bellagio - so we got to see the water show more than a few times while we ate. \n\nThe food = even more incredible. We started off with the Blue Cheese Souffl\u00e9 Pudding, Walnut Pecan Petite Salad. Holy god, that was good. For entrees, we had the Aged New York Steak, Braised Celery Heart, Bone Marrow, Cabernet Reduction and the Filet of Sea Bass, Fingerlings, Double Smoked Bacon, Crispy Potato, Petit Mache. Plus, we shared the Potato Gratin. It was all AMAZING. And they aren't messin' around with the portions. Everything was as filling as it was delicious. \n\nTo finish off, the special Eiffel Tower Souffl\u00e9s in Chocolate and Raspberry. They take 30 minutes to make, so we had the foresight to order them before our meal and they were just perfect. The waiter does this fancypants thing where he pours the cream and chocolate into them at your table and they get all big & fluffy. mmm. MMMM. \n\nThe topper: our *very* French waiter was great! Constantly checked up on us, made funny jokes, and didn't even blink when I spilled water all over the table. In fact, he moved us to another! \n\nAll in all - just the best. I would for sure splurge to go here again. It was romantic and beautiful and I left completely satisfied."

We even got a window table with a view of the Bellagio Fountains.  \n\nWe ordered some cocktails that were from their cookbook, so we decided to try them.  I cant remember what they were called, but they were good. \n\nThe avocado cold soup thing that they brought out was great, it was crisp and for lack of a better description, tasted like a super fresh, smooth quacamole. \n\nWe split the heirloom tomato salad, which was so light, yet so flavorful. It was so good, we had to try to make it at home when we got back.  It had heirloom tomatoes, avocado, radish and some celery leaves.  The dressing was tomato water with a basil oil.  SO GOOD. \n\nThe bread guy that comes around is great.  He does his job well, maybe a little too well.  I was full off the bread before the meal even came. \n\nFor dinner, we ordered the Filet Mignon and the Beef Wellington.  The filet was tender and flavorful, and cooked just right.  They tell you in advance that the Wellington cant be cooked to order, because they have to cook it until the puff pastry is done, which is good for those that dont already know that.  We also ordered the creamed spinach and mushrooms and the au gratin potatoes.  The spinach and mushrooms were delicious, and the potatoes were decent. They just didnt \"WOW\" me.  \n\nWhile ordering your meal, the server asks you if you will be ordering a Souffle, because they have to put the order in early since they take time to cook.  We read reviews on Yelp that said you have to try the souffle, so we chose the chocolate one.  It was light and had just the right amount of flavor.  Next time, I think I'd like to try the raspberry one, if it is in season. The waiter was super nice, and he brought out this cute chocolate...thing...on a plate that said happy anniversary in chocolate.  \n\nSince it was a nice night out, we bought tickets to go up to the top of the Eiffel Tower, and it was super convenient that we could buy them through the restaurant.  We also bought a copy of their cookbook, so that we could learn to make that addicting tomato salad at home.  Our bill came out to just under $300, for 2 people.  Not too bad considering we paid $35 for the cookbook and $30 for the Eiffel Tower Tickets. \n\nThe only reason I am deducting one star, is that the downstairs staff isnt very friendly, and when we had trouble finding the elevator to go up to the restaurant, this elevator control lady was rude, telling us that this was only the DOWN elevator and to stop pressing the button."

Read my story.\n\nWalking in: you see a magnificent kitchen with focused culinary artists paying attention to every detail of the food.\n\nThen, you wait for the host to tell you there's no window seats available though the restaurant just opened. You are puzzled and confused. You wait 30 minutes for the table and the host skips you because you're dad is the only one of your party there but you left for the bathroom. (A rule I've never heard before) You're forced to awkwardly ask for a window seat again. Finally, while making friendly chit chat with the  hostess, you get what you want..\n\nYou take selfies for da memoriez but you have waiters and waitresses giving you major stink eye.\n\nSoon, the server comes to offer a great arrangement of breads with butter and a palette cleanser.\n\nYour waiter comes up to you right after and expects you to have a decision. You don't and you are rushed to order. The waiter is very annoyed and walks away. So you feel unwelcomed....\n\nThe waiter comes a second time. We all order something different. He leaves. As he comes back around, you want to change your order to salmon instead of chicken. He tells you, \"No, I already ordered chicken in the kitchen.\" You say oh okay never mind :). And the waiter dashes off in a hasty fashion. You don't get it, that something easily changable. Honestly, you would go to the kitchen and change it yourself if you could.\n\nYou receive your food with stunning presentation, it was quite the instagram meal to go with the view. You were enjoying every bite but your dad didn't like his chicken. He told our, so far, degenerate waiter that he wasn't expecting shards of bones and grissle in the chicken. Waiter said, \"Well it's not supposed to be boneless\" your dad says,\"I know but I wasn't expecting shards of bone and grissle I was expecting a breast\" and the waiter says,\"Oh okay.\" And dashes off once again. I thought he would at least apologize. The restaurant is VERY dimly lit so reading the menu for someone with bad eye sight is HARD. Especially when half is in french and some ingredients are things you've never even heard of. We watch him suffer through his meal.\n\nFrom that rude encounter, you knew this waiter already did not like your family because they didn't order quick enough and he really just wants us to go away. You don't think they've had any strange requests or rude remarks. They're just a bunch of awkward, quiet folk over here.\n\nThis waiter decides to have happy chit chats with all the other customers around you and runs past your table every single time, which is kind of distracting. Not like you wanted to ask anything more from him anyway. \n\nIt's a great place to take pictures with family. They would get up by the window on occasion to take pictures with the Bellagio fountain. Meanwhile, that waiter would sit in the dark corner and GLARES at you having a good time. AND HE WOULD TALK ABOUT YOU WITH OTHER WAITERS. It's getting really ridiculous now. Clearly he doesn't want a tip. AND your family stayed there shorter than both tables beside them and your family were quiet people. NO DISTURBANCE. They definitely rubbed this waiter the wrong way but not for him to turn all middle schooler on us, damn!\n\nYou decide to be nice to him. When he collected our plates and uneasily offered dessert. You smiled at him and acted very pleased. And he actually asked where were you guys from and you said the Bay Area. And he said Aw California. And he dropped the menus and walked away.... Okay.\n\nThe waiter comes by right when we finished and collects the plates and drops the bill on the table. As so expected, very unwelcoming.\n\nBasically, y'all paid for the spot. and like many others your party stayed there for a little while longer. Soak in the breathtaking sight: the fountains, the lights, the dimmly lit room!\n\nBegan to leave and the waiter is glaring at you again, pointing you out to his waiter buddies. It takes a while to put on my coat and scarf and he intends to just keep staring at my family and I. I hope this time he was staring at us because he noticed no tip on the table...\n\nThe management clearly cannot stand the type that aren't fancy and high class. My waiter deeply disliked us for no real reason other than maybe we embodied some aspects of bad customers before. But I believe he deserved the no tip left on the badly cleaned table. Leaving on a positive note, the restaurant has an excellent taste for any savory or sweet dishes. All foods are creamy and I absolutely love that! The view is everything! But I wish the waiters and hosts put more care into their craft like that cooks."

It was our first experience here, and what an experience it was!\n\nI made reservations which I quickly realized wasn't necessary when we got there, the place was mostly empty on a Thursday. Unless you are a VIP, lol, only 2-person tables are up against the windows. For larger parties you have to sit more towards the middle of the restaurant. The view isn't bad though, just not as good. But what a view, we even stayed long enough to see the Fountains at Bellagio show. \n\nOur server was extremely friendly and helpful to us. We began lunch with the Cheese Fondue with Poached Egg. This was so delicious!! We regularly have fondue, but have never tried it with an egg. Note: The bread that comes with the fondue was oily/buttery so if you don't want that make sure to ask. \n\nThey give you a small cup of soup to start off the meal. I can't recall what it was but it was definitely tasty. They also served us various breads as we awaited our entree. The one I remember most had tons of peppercorns on it, so obviously a little spicy, not my favorite.\n\nI was treating a few others besides my parents and at a place like this sometimes you let your wallet choose your entree. So sadly I went with the Burger. The Burger was fine but not the best on the menu. They will look at you weird if you ask for traditional/american mustard too. What can I say, I don't like that french dijon stuff. My mom was raving about the Sea Food Salad she got!! She told me to make sure and recommend this in my review, lol. \n\nWe had a few mimosas to go along with our meal. Not the best I've had, and definitely on the strong side. I think its great OJ that makes a great mimosa not pouring heavily on the champagne, but you won't catch me complaining to much there.\n\nWe decided to skip dessert, but as a gesture they brought my parents out a small dessert plate with candies and chocolates on the side for the rest of us. They looked very happy to eat it!\n\nOverall a great experience along with quite possibly the best view of the strip from any restaurant around. Food and service is top notch.\n\nThey aren't affiliated with the rewards card used by The Paris Hotel, so sadly you can't collect any rewards points here :(:(:("

The Eiffel Tower was incredible. We didn't have a reservation but had no problem getting a table. It was so nice to find a place that actually sticks to it's dress code. I hate being the only patrons dressed appropriately in an upscale restaurant. We were seated close to the window so we could see the fountains. It's actually pretty brilliant the way the dining room is laid out so everyone can get some sort of view. \nAnyway, we started with the sea scallops which were divine! Cooked to perfection, melted in your mouth- but you are only paying for 2 so be aware. \nOur server made great recommendations. My bf had the halibut and could not stop raving about the flavor! I had the red snapper and it was brilliant! I wanted to order more! Unfortunately the portions are a bit small for my taste but that was to be expected.\nAnd now comes the best part of the meal....They have like 5 or 6 types of souffle! We opted for the pistachio souffle and I kid you not, IT WAS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH!\n\nYes, this place is pricey but worth every penny! The service was great, the food was wonderful and the view unmatched. I recommend going around sunset and watch the strip come to life!"

At $189.99 per person I thought we'd get seated next to a window, but instead we got packed into the middle of the restaurant.\n\n3. the 5 course meal was extremely limited. Only fish or beef (not even steak) were the main course.\n\n4. the food felt too fancy and there was no substance to it. The first course was three 1/2 inch items on one plate, mushroom, some stuffed cracker, and something else. \nThe remainder of the 5 course meal was: a small salad, then 2 shrimp and shredded pear(?), and then the small beef steak, not even rib-eye, or New York, and then a piece of cake with one scoop of ice cream.\n\nThe total bill was close to $500, for 2 people. Of course 18% gratuity already included.\n\nThe best part of the whole evening was the bread, it was really good. The french bread and the multi grain bread. But I wouldn't come here just for the bread.\n\nIt was really a let down to come here. Especially for the price, this was really a shit show, and I would not come here again or recommend anyone to come here again."

There are better options in the strip and downtown. Maybe less pretentious but a better experince overall. Be ready to spend big bucks. For example, went with wife and spent 250 tip included for salad,entree and souffle. No drinks except water. Tables are way too close. I could hear next table's conversation even if I tried not to. Unaceptable for a place this expensive."

            "review": "A Nitty-Gritty Layman's Guide to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant\n\nReservations:  A must, particularly if you'd like to be seated during pique lunch or dinner hour.  If you're flexible, i.e. supper at 9:45, take a chance and walk in.\n\nAttire:  Business casual. (We were somewhat dressier.)  I witnessed a couple being turned away because of their jeans and tee shirts.\n\nService:  Spot on.  Our server, Michael, was friendly and helpful.  We never wanted for a thing.\n\nWine:  If you're a connoisseur, I suspect you'll delight in the wine list.  If you're like me, a person who appreciates a California red, but doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg, your choices are limited.  You can order Shiraz at $12 a glass, or go for a bottle of Rodney Strong Merlot @ $59, which is what we did.  Over-priced, but less money than virtually everything else.  By the way, if you choose to bring your own wine, expect a ludicrous corkage fee of $75 per bottle.\n\nPrix Fixe: The six course tasting menu is $125 per person.  Wine pairing is an additional $79 and if you'd like a souffl\u00e9, tack on $8 more.  Two things to note: 1) if one person wants the prix fixe, everyone at the table must be in accord and order the same. 2) There is no flexibility in the  menu. Courses are as presented with no choice or substitutions. (Based on reviews of the venison, we decided to order a la carte.)\n\nOur Meals\nAppetizers:   Of the appetizers, two were particularly good:  the casco bay sea scallops and my cold foie gras which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I could have done without the accompanying fig compote or toast points.  (Make your selection from the bread basket instead.)\n\nSalad: My husband and daughter ordered the market green salad, which appeared unremarkable.  Better choice may be what's called the  \"non-traditional\" Caesar salad with warm anchovies, capers and garlic vinaigrette.\n\nEntrees:  Perhaps the best received dish was T's roasted rack of lamb and tomato tart.  He thought it impeccable.  My Muscovy duck breast was good, but not as tasty as duck I recently had in Atlanta. My daughter enjoyed her filet mignon, but again, there was nothing extraordinary about it.  You'll find that meats are high quality,  and cooked to perfection.  If you want it rare, you'll get it rare.\n\nDessert:  Curious about the \"acclaimed\" souffl\u00e9s, we ordered two.  (Note that the order must go in, early on.)  None of us were bowled over.  The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was ordinary, the caramel somewhat better.   Perhaps this is petty, but coffee at $7 per person seems excessive.....\n\nIn Summation: I vacillate between three and four stars.  We spent $500 for dinner that was indeed good, but hardly stand-out.  I'm happy for the experience ; the view of the fountains, as everyone points out, can't be beat.  Am I glad we came?  Sure!  Will we return?  Nope."

We got to see that they were diligently preparing the food. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. He answered all our questions and gave us good recommendations. \n\nWe ordered shrimp spaghetti veggies salad, slow-roasted filet atlantic salmon with pinot noir sauce, roasted semi-boneless chicken with butternut squash, and char broiled filet mignon with red wine sauce. We ended up trying each other dishes since all the food looked so yummy. The salad came with 6-7 jumbo shrimps! The salad tasted light and healthy. My salmon dish came out to be perfect. It smelled great and tasted soft and amazing with the pinot noir sauce. The chicken came out to be the biggest portion out of all our dishes. It tasted differently from the typical marinated chicken we usually ate. Although it was smallest portion, the steak turned out to be excellent. It was medium-rare cooked. It tasted tender and juicy with the red wine sauce. For dessert, we had the banana souffle. It's the best I've tasted!!! Highly recommended!!! Our bill came out to be almost $400...it was because we also ordered wine and cocktails.\n\nOverall the atmosphere was very cozy and romantic. They have a gorgeous view, and the restaurant itself is nicely decorated. Great service throughout the dinner. Two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars: 1) food and drinks a bit overpriced 2) small food portion.\n\nMY TIPS:\n\n1) MAKE A RESERVATION, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT. (YOU CAN'T REQUEST SITTING ARRANGEMENT, I TRIED)\n\n2) THOUGH YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRESS-UP NICELY, I RECOMMEND IT SO YOU CAN TAKE PICS. PLUS IT'S FUN DRESSING UP. :D (THOSE WHO WORRY ABOUT DRESS CODE, YES YOU CAN WEAR JEANS, BUT WEAR IT WITH A NICE TOP AND YOU SHOULD BE GOOD.)\n\n3) BRING A CAMERA, SO YOU CAN TAKE LOTS OF PICS!! (LADIES- WHEN YOU VISIT THE RESTROOM, TAKE YOUR CAMERA WITH YOU. IT HAS A NICE ARRANGEMENT. ;P)\n\n4) FOR THOSE WHO WORRY ABOUT $$$ AND NOT BEING FULL ENOUGH, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO EAT A BIG LUNCH FIRST. IF YOU'RE GOING WITH A PARTNER, YOU CAN ALWAYS ORDER ONE MEAL AND SHARE. ANOTHER OPTION IS YOU CAN ALWAYS EAT DINNER SOMEWHERE ELSE FIRST, AND THEN STOP BY THIS RESTAURANT TO ENJOY SOME DESSERTS INSTEAD. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH DESSERTS. (KIDS NOT RECOMMENDED BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT ENJOY/LIKE THE FANCY FOOD. PLUS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING A KID'S MENU)\n\n5) I RECOMMEND GOING WITH A DATE SINCE THE SETTING IS VERY ROMANTIC AT NIGHT, AND YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SITTING BY THE WINDOW WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE GORGEOUS VIEW AND THE BELLAGIO'S WATER SHOW RATHER THAN WITH A BIG GROUP.\n\nEnjoy your food!"

I had my wedding reception here a few years ago and always recommend it to everyone for their \"flawless performance.\"  The night started out bad when we were told that we had to check our nice bottle of (Napa Cab) wine, despite the fact that it does not say it on their web site visibly and when we searched for it on other sites they said it was allowed.  The wine we ended up ordering was nowhere near the quality of the wine we brought.  None of the hosts were very friendly or warm, but I'm assuming that is part of the ambiance.  There was a huge burn mark from a plate on our table.  I asked for the sauce for my steak on the side and it came out covered.  The restaurant is disconnected from the hotel so if you're hoping to add points to any reward card, think again.  The site does say that a jacket is encouraged but clearly not enforced since I saw torn up jeans.  The final end to our evening was the elevator hostess looking like she wanted to hit someone.  When I tried to cheer her up she only scowled at me.  Maybe she was feeling the Parisian vibe as well.  Overall, it was an incredibly expensive evening that was far from the perfect experience I'm used to here.  Sadly, I won't be coming back or recommending it in the future as I had done. \n\nTo be balanced, the bus boys were wonderful and the quality of the Filet Mignon was quite high.  However, I feel you can get that in other areas on the strip."

The view is breathtaking and wherever you are in the restaurant you can get a glimpse of the awesome fountain show at Bellagio.\n\nThe food is pretty mediocre all the way.  Pricey, my dish was $44 for black cod baked in a bag.  My dinner guest had short ribs, pretty small portions for $52.  For these prices, they can do much better with the quality of food in terms of presentation and the taste.  But then again, you are paying for location and view.\n\nI thought it would be super touristy but it wasn't at all that bad.  Probably be more like 2 1/2 stars as opposed to 2.  Would probably not go back there again but was worth the experience for the view."

This restaurant has the most excellent, romantic view you can find anywhere the strip.  This restaurant really lucks out being across the street from the Bellagio fountains.  They perform every 10 - 15 minutes.  You're also in direct view of City Center and Caesar's - right in the middle of the action.  \n\nIf anything I'd be careful when ordering wine, they're marked up 200% to 300%.   So you're looking at least $90 for a decent bottle.  Which is ok, because of the view, service and the whole experience.  Just get ready to spend at least $250 on your total bill - and have it be worth it.  \n\nMake reservations, too.  We did and they gave us a prime table, right next to the window in the corner.  Unbelievable.  Bring your camera and dress up.  This is high class dining people."

We requested for a table with a great view of the Bellagio Fountains, and when we got there, our table had the best view in the house. (There is a picture of it on their facebook page--it's almost the very first table in front of the fountains).  Jennifer also stopped at our table and she really knows how to make sure that a dinner becomes an experience that we will never forget. I honestly got so thrilled with the atmosphere of the restaurant that everything else that came with it made the night perfect. At first, I was a bit nervous about contacting the manager and making a request since it is a popular spot and almost everyone wants a great table, but it really doesn't hurt to ask :) \n\nTips: get a table around 530 to 6pm-ish because the restaurant is not packed when we got there--plus, that was right around sunset so we had a nice palette of colors to watch; the scallop/oxtail appetizer was perfect and fresh; and the chocolate souffle just melts in your mouth, it's really worth waiting 20 minutes for dessert :) \n\nThis is my very first review here on Yelp, I just thought I would shower this restaurant with compliments because they deserve it. Like I said, it wasn't just the amazing french dinner, but the whole thing was about experiencing the best customer service, a romantic ambiance, and the best view of the Strip. Thank you so much Jennifer and the rest of the staff at Eiffel Tower Restaurant!"

They didn't have to be, but it just goes to show you how immaculately professional and courteous this place is.\n\nWhen we finally arrived, we waited no more than 10 minutes to be seated at a window seat with the most luscious view of the Bellagio fountains. The hostess, our server and even the random guy that came around to give us more bread rolls and cheese balls were all kind, polite and never once rushed us throughout our entire 3 hour (!!!) dinner. \n\nIf you do decide to come here I highly recommend the tasting menu. While a few of the dishes were quite forgettable, the the view and the service more than made up for it. We had:\n\n- Trio of appetizers/les amuses bouche: The mushroom custard was incredible.\n- Warm lobster soup: The soup itself was lovely, but it was covered it what I can only guess was a spring roll wrapper. Curious, indeed.\n- Halibut: Good, but meh.\n- Roasted rack of lamb with tarragon jus: Highlight of the evening. The lamb was tender with a slightly crispy \"crust.\" \n- Camembert wrapped in poached pears: Seriously disgusting. I like cheese, but that combo was hard to stomach.\n- I had the Grand Marnier souffle and he had the pistachio souffle. Both we exquisite--both exhibited a delicate taste through the slightly eggy custard texture. The server suggested the chocolate souffle which we will definitely try the next time."

It's honestly been a dream of mine for years to eat at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant when in Vegas but I've never been able to attend, but wow was the wait worth it!\n\nI made a reservation about a week or two in advance for lunch at 11:30am on a Tuesday to celebrate my anniversary with my partner and the few people who helped me over the phone were super nice and respectful. I asked for a window table since I was celebrating a special occasion and the receptionist was able to secure me the best table in the house! The coveted corner table!\n\nThe views were absurdly gorgeous! The rose I requested from them was placed on the table and was beautiful. The food was amazing, we had a little cup of leek soup courtesy of the chef which was great, their French Onion Soup was to die for! And at $8 for an appetizer it's such a good find! We ordered the French Buccatini pasta which was one of the best pastas I've ever eaten as well as Chicken Parmesan with potatoes and green vegetables which was equally as delicious. Finally, we were surprised with a Happy Anniversary Chocolate Mousse executed with an amazing presentation!\n\nAll in all, a phenomenal experience that was the highlight of my trip and made my anniversary super special to me and my partner. Amazing service, beautiful restaurant and perfect food, and $20 average for a lunch plate is not bad at all! I'll definitely be returning next time I'm in Vegas, and hopefully turn coming here into a new tradition!"

Guys - you cant go wrong taking your ladies here just for this amazing view - very romantic. \nThe breads they serve you were all top notch, along with a couple of appetizers we had brought out.

We also ordered duck, which was cooked perfectly, and seasoned just right.  We couldnt fit in dessert, so I dont know what that was like here.  \nService was impeccable and truly beyond ordinary.

Last time, it was special for view, ambiance, food, and service, but now I think we will not be back.  Almost all tables have a view; that is still nice.  I think this place has now taken on much more of a \"tourist trap\" feel.  Waiter was patronizing, overly pushy toward up-selling everything, and seemed to want us to hurry to turn over the table.  We wanted a single app (smoked salmon) for four of us, and he told us it would be small...we had had before, and knew it was enough.  He told us we had to order entire meal at once, rather than taking our time with drinks and appetizer.  He tried to steer each of us to a more expensive plate, insisted we must order sides, and even questioned our wine choices.  My wife's chicken dish was awful, all dry dark meat, poorly-seasoned, and poorly-presented.  Understanding this was not a \"signature\" dish, we still expected quality, but when we commented, the waiter wanted to argue the point; poor form.  Frankly, for the almost $400 we paid, this experience was dismal.  Go for a drink at bar, skip the dinner."

I have never been blown away by a dinner like this one before. \n\nFirst, the restaurant alone sits itself in the sky, practically.  You are greeted downstairs by the hostess and then personally escorted in their triangular elevator to then be greeted again by the maitre de.  Immediately you notice the breathtaking view of the Las Vegas Strip and what is right in front of your eyes is the beautiful Bellagio.  As we were walking in, the water show at the Bellagio had started and I was completely mesmerized.  No matter where you sit in this restaurant, you are guaranteed a spectacular view.  \n\nKeep in mind, reservations are a MUST at this restaurant.  Dressing up is a MUST.  And if you decide to book last minute (like we did) then you have to give them a reason why you are celebrating.  \n\nWe were seated right in front of the restaurant, right in front of the Bellagio and the water show.\n\nWe were given the most excellent service by our waiter who delicately explained every plate that came out to \"stimulate our palettes\".  We ordered the \"Le Menu\" special which consisted of 6 courses and 1 choice of dessert.  I won't even go into how delicious the food was especially the dessert (get the souffle! get the souffle!) because if I did I'd be writing a novel for a review.  Just trust me on this one, it is FINE DINING at its' FINEST.  And when you're there you must ask your waiter for the sweetest Pinot Grigio wine they have.  (But be prepared to pay $90 for a bottle) Then again, you get what you pay for so for the wine connoisseur, this is your place as they have over 500 selections of wine. \n\nBe forewarned though,  this is not a place to go to if you're on a budget.  All in all we spent a good $400 for what I can call \"one of the most romantic and best dinners of my life\".  Was it worth it?  Well , when you just won $1600 in roulette the night before I'd say hell yah.  All kidding aside though, even though the dinner was worth as much as a Gucci bag, it was an experience that will never be forgotten.  So yes, it was worth it."

            "review": "January 18th we had reservations for our party of 8. It all started out good but ended with a Hugh disappointment. First when we told the waitress we wanted separate checks for every 2 people she looked at us perplexed. We literally pointed and said those two, these two, us two and them two making it very easy for her, but again she looked perplexed. She was a blonde. Trust me I am a blonde and could have done her job with my eyes closed. Ok so let's move on. Next was the ordering. The food was very expensive, you could order let's say the venison but you then had to order a vegetable or potato dish to go with it.  Once we all placed our order we thought we were good to go. One of our group accidentally spilled her water and the water went across the table, leaked through the table to where I was sitting and drip by drip went on the floor it also got spilled on her friends piece of bread, to which the bread soaked it up completely. When the friends guest (mind you it was my brother and his wife, myself and my boyfriend and the others minus one lady we all went to school together. So getting back to this breakdown, the one lady asked for another piece of bread. IT took the waitress over an hour to bring a simple piece of bread to the lady. So after sitting for 1.5 hours our food finally arrived. Grant it the food was delicious but the wait time was horrendous. My brother asked for a glass of wine with dinner and had to ask for it again as it never came. I guess they went to the other side of the world to get it. After dinner came the checks. Can you feel the tension growing now? They had the guts to add 18% gratuity to all the checks and again mind you they can only do this on a party of 8. There were 4 separate checks.  My sister in law and I both got up, and went to see the manager. We told them the service was horrible, the food was good but should not have taken 1.5 hours for it to be delivered, we tried several times to flag a waiter or waitress but to no avail. We asked the manager how he was going to compensate us for our meal? He told us that he would take the 18% gratuity off and let us put our own tip amount in. We said fine. I told my boyfriend not to sign the check as the 18% was coming off and the waitress was redoing our bill. I guess the others didn't realize what was going on and one of them signed it regardless. We all agreed that the food was delicious and well done but we would not go back again as the service was horrible, the time waiting for our meal was inexcusable, and the waitress was indescribable.  I am being generous in giving 2 stars. The company was awesome as we the food and the wine we had paired with our meal."

And I suggest  you guys to try the desserts they have at least one in your life. You will love it. The tase was so great, and not really sweet, Perfect. A+++. I paid almost $100 for both of us.

My entree was the beef wellington, which was my first time experiencing this type of dish. The steak was terrific and the pastry that surrounds it tastes very similar to a vietnamese / french pastry that I enjoy, called P\u00e2t\u00e9 chaud. Please be warned that it will take up to 45 minutes to bake so order early! The others in my party had the Filet Mignon, Roasted Semi-boneless chicken, and the Muscovy Duck Breast. We all shared a bit of each others meals and they were all great! For desert, we split the Pistachio Souffle which was very delicious! We had a great view of the strip on vegas and saw a bit of the water show at Bellagio from our seats. Very Romantic."

I love how we got a window seat and how the table and seating makes you face the window but slightly angled so you are facing the person you are with.\n\nThe food here is absolutely amazing. Even the bread that they give you, and you get to choose what kind of bread you want. We ordered the Black Pepper Marinated Raw Beef and that was amazing, the texture of the beef and the flavor was delicious and it came with toast. \n\nFor entree my boyfriend had the Duck Breast and Duck Leg Confit, and I had the Filet Mignon with B\u00e9arnaise sauce. It was one of the best Filet Mignon I ever had, and I really enjoyed the B\u00e9arnaise sauce... I pretty much drowned my filet mignon in it....\n\nIf you want to get a side, you should definitely try the Classic Potato Gratin. It was soooo delicious, covered in cheese and the potato was soft. It tasted soooo good.\n\nFor our dessert we had the Chocolate Souffle, which the server told us that it takes 30 minutes to make so we had to order it when we ordered everything else. The souffle was really good, it was really chocolatey but was not ridiculously sweet. Even my boyfriend who doesn't really like eating chocolate liked it. \n\nThis place was really romantic and we had a great view of the Bellagio Fountain. It was just amazing. And they have a photographer that takes your picture and puts it in this pretty frame for $24. Had an amazing night here. Love this place."

At the end of the second course, we felt the dinner was moving along too quickly.  I asked the waiter to slow down the pace, and he obliged so we could spend plenty of time taking in the Bellagio fountains at sunset, watching the casinos light up as we stared transfixed at the beauty of Las Vegas and the beauty of each other, quietly holding hands under the table, engaging in fun conversation about us, each other, life, and so many things.  \n\nSometimes a dining experience is positive because the food is excellent (as was the case with the Lamb - wow), but what I strongly recall as I compose this review  a week later is how the meal facilitated a romantic interlude.  It also facilitated a marriage proposal at the table next to us.  I recommend this place even more so for those who are in love or want to fall in love."

No joke! \n\nThe food is great though. Since we took the leap of coming to this boojee ass restaurant I decided to splurge and get myself a $50 steak. What does a $50 steak taste like? Fucking delicious, atleast that's what I keep telling myself for ordering a $50 steak that came with no sides. But really though it was great even though I only have cheaper restaurant steaks to compare it to. The French waiter was cool at first, he was attentive but then he seemed to care more for a couple of girls and ignored our asses for the rest of the night. That is until it was time to pick up the check and get his tip then he was circling our table like a vulture.\n\nAll and all, I try to say \"fuck it\" every once in a while and go all out. Chances are I could get a ticket for making an illegal u-turn or some dumb shit and waste my money on that instead. Now atleast I can say I had a $50 steak and it was de-fucking-licious.\n\nP.S.

The deco is old and dingy. This is definitely not a \"fine\" Michellin-star dining experience. \n\nThe good: the view is quite good. You got a panorama view of the Bellagio fountains, though if you really want to see the fountain, Le Cirque and Picasso in Bellagio would have better views. \n\nThe unexpected: for such a touristy place, the food is actually quite decent. The bread is fresh and tasty; the drinks are well-made while not exceptional; my entree (cod) is tasty as well... typical good French cooking.\n\nOverall I will not go back because it was so touristy. Le Cirque and Picasso are much better (also more expensive). I can see it being fun for some one who wanna go to a destination restaurant while having decent food."

If the collective internet beats its chest and hoots about how ever little moment is the \"best\" and \"worst\" then the praise and admonition lose their value so I will simply start with this; our dinner at Eiffel Tower on Saturday was a tremendous disappointment and we will not return.\n\nDinner started well enough. We were seated at a lovely two top which offered a view of sunset playing out over the Bellagio's fountain and the visually arresting architecture of City Center. The ambiance of Eiffel Tower itself was lovely and made clear that wasn't just a window to look out! We should expect great things! These expectations went unmet.\n\nDinner started well enough a cucumber palette cleanser and Cold Foie Gras Torchon. Then our entr\u00e9es arrived and things went down hill fast. I tucked into my rabbit to find the preparation unengaging, bland and forgettable. There was nothing about it that made clear why lapin is a cornerstone of classic French cuisine. As our appetizer, ambiance and service thus far had been good I was prepared to work through my concerns. Then my wife cut into her filet. A steak ordered medium rare was served somewhere between medium well and well done. She took a bite hoping that the steak was salvageable and it wasn't. When our server returned my wife shared her concern and the server's response was to shield the steak from the sun with her hand and to tell my wife that her eyes were playing tricks on her and that this gray mass was a medium rare steak. As my wife opened her mouth to reply the server, having realized how gauche response to situation was cut my wife off and said \"Unless of course you tried it. Then you know it is overdone.\" My wife affirmed that this was the case. Her food was taken up as I continued poking through my rabbit.\n\nI had taken the last bite of my rabbit and without a word a busser swooped onto our table and wordlessly grabbed my plate. I'd yet to even have a bite of the wild mushrooms I'd ordered or the potatoes but the plate was snatched and gone before I could say a word. When a new steak was brought out we had to ask for fresh silver and a new plate just so I could sample the accompaniments I ordered.\n\nAs our meal drew to a close and my wife and I prepared to leave the same over active busser returned to our table. His arms already full from another two top he had cleared and he began to grab our plates. He was, by the way, the third employee to step on my foot to reach over me that evening. It was obvious his arms were too full and that he was having difficulty maintaing balance in his hands as he put the last plate into his arms the whole thing gave way and he managed to drop our dishes all over my dinner jacket and slacks, covering them in potatoes. He hurriedly gathering them back up and rushed away without acknowledging the oil stain that will require dry cleaning on my jacket.\n\nMy wife and I would have asked to speak to a manager regarding dinner but we had tickets for a show at Bally's and had to leave. I can't in good faith suggest this place to anyone but Is suppose Beth and I could have just been terribly unlucky."

            "review": "My boyfriend and I came here during CES week (2nd week of January) on a Thursday or Friday night. I was looking for something that had a good atmosphere, and I've heard stories about the view at this place. I'm not sure if it was because it was CES week, but this place seemed a lot louder than I expected. \n\nVenue:\n- Gorgeous views: you can see the Bellagio Fountain show go off while dining!\n- Very intimate: the window tables are quite small (half the size of a normal table), but it is a great excuse to get closer to the person you're dining with.\n- Pretty loud during CES week: it was similar to a casual sit-down restaurant, in terms of noise level - it was hard to have a good conversation without raising our voices or leaning in really close.\nWe were seated at a window seat, so we had a perfect view of the strip. If you reserve ahead of time, I think you can request a window seat - I'd highly recommend it! It's beautiful, the only con for me was the amount of people coming to the window side to take pictures of the view. Overall, considering it was CES week, I give the venue a 4/5 - minus one star for the noise level.\n\nService:\n- Helpful service: the waiters were not only friendly, but very helpful! This was our first time trying French Food, and our waitress was very insightful and patient when we ordered\n- Perhaps new waiters?: Some of them might have been new, ie: while pouring water into my cup, a waiter splashed some over my  plate. \n- Average speed: the speed our food came out was pretty average, not a huge long wait, but not super quickly either. I personally didn't notice it that much, simply because the view kept us entertained until the food arrived\nIn terms of service, I'd rate this place 4/5. Although the waiters/waitresses were friendly and helpful, I wouldn't say that it's up to par for the cost of the meal (roughly $450). They were great in terms of how helpful and insightful they were, but trying to get the attention of our specific waitress later in the night was a little bit more difficult. \n\nFood:\nI don't usually eat French food, so in terms of food - but I still thought it was pretty good. I ordered the filet mignon with foie gras on top - medium rare, which was delicious. In terms of food, I'd rate it 4/5. Although it was good, a few months later, the taste doesn't stick for me (personally). Therefore, I wouldn't rank it the best filet mignon I've ever had, but maybe that's just me. It's pretty big portions, however, which was surprising. \n\nOverall, I thought the atmosphere outranked the food, for me. I feel that the food wasn't worth $400+ (2 main entrees, 2 appetizers, 1 dessert and 1 cocktail), but it was still good. Maybe I'm not a huge fan of French Food, but the combination of the gorgeous venue and the good food would make me come back. I figure that the price you're paying is equivalent to the premium views as well as the food - so overall, it was a great experience. I'd love to try it again next time I return to Vegas, just maybe on a less exciting week. Maybe then, the noise level wouldn't be as crazy, and I could actually have a good conversation with my boyfriend without raising our voices :]"

The bread, amuse, and dessert were a nice touch, and the VIEW was second to none. I can only imagine what the view is like from the REAL eiffel tower and I would predict that this is better ONLY because of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nThe only thing I wished they would do is pipe the music from the fountain show into the restaurant. (Because it's the music WITH the fountains that make it so exquisite.)"

Well, it wasn't as cheesy as I expected.  As soon as we stepped into the dining room, I felt like we were floating above The Strip.  The dining room is dark so the lights of Vegas looked amazing all around us.  The service was top notch and the food was fabulous.\n\nIt's probably the best view in Vegas.  The best tables are in the front of the dining room right next to the windows facing the Bellagio fountain, but we didn't get those tables because most of those tables are for 2 ppl and we had 3.  Larger 4 ppl tables are behind those.  So if you want the best view, it's probably best to go as a couple.  However, even from our table at the side of the restaurant, we were able to enjoy the Bellagio fountain shows and also get a great view down the strip.  I could see Aria, NYNY, Excalibur, and Luxor from where I was sitting!\n\nWe all had the $89 pre-fiix Tasting Menu and it was worth it.  Every course was melt in your mouth yum.  (6 courses including dessert)  Here's the Tasting Menu: \nhttp://www.eiffeltowerrestaurant.com/images/eiffel/pdfs/menus/tasting.pdf\nIt's really the best deal since you get a bit of lobster, halibut, and lamb.  I'm not a huge lamb fan, but their lamb was great!  The tasting menu had smaller portions, but I was stuffed by the end of the meal.  We also dished out an additional $6 each to get the Souffle instead of the regular dessert.  Again, totally worth it.  We each got a different flavor and sampled each others: Pistachio, Grand Marnier, and Chocolate..  All were beautifully sweet and fluffy but with their own personalities.  Definitely don't miss out on the Souffle.\n\nThe bar looked like a good alternative if you don't want to spend the $$ on dinner.  But once you see the view, you might want to send the whole evening there."

I had food coma after eating so much deliciousness."

They seated us right in front of the water show (which I saw like 7 times without the music). The food was good but the dessert was fantastic. We got a tower of thinly sliced bananas and vanilla  chocolate shaped in a tower. The other desserts looked good also but we were too full from the main course.  If your looking for  romantic restaurant to take a love one, this is definitely the spot."

Often I feel almost uncomfortable when going to nice restaurants because I get the feeling I have to show my best manners or talk in a relatively low voice.  \nAlthough we did not have a window seat, we still got an excellent view of the Bellagio water show.\nNot being a salad orderer, I was greatly surprised when my aunt ordered the warm lobster salad.  Wow is all I have to say about that, I have never \"enjoyed\" eating a salad, except this particular time.  The freshness of the vegetables shines, all salads should be prepared with this much dedication.\nI got the surf and turf and was was disappointed when I finished it.  The steak melted in my mouth, along with the flavor explosion that came from the crab.  \nI was a bit disappointed by the wine list, although larger than a Websters Dictionary, did not have a bottle under $100.  Because I was lucky enough not to pay, I was happy enjoying my beer instead.  \nDessert was an experience in itself as everyone at the table sat silently while closing their eyes during every bite.  We ordered 4 different desserts and all were worth writing home to mom about.\nI would go back, but make sure you bring a credit card with a high limit."

The planning and such leading up to the night was very smooth and organized thanks to their event staff.  The actual night itself went just as smoothly.  We sat in the special corner window table overlooking the fountains.  It was beautifully decorated and setup upon arrival.  The meal was delicious and then the ring was brought out on the banana desert on a covered platter. Our waiter and the rest of the staff couldn't have been better.  I was blown away by how well everything was handled. (I had enough on my mind already!)\nWhile a bit pricey, this was a once in a lifetime event and was worth it to me.

Mood lighting, delicious food, and the perfect view of the Bellagio water show made for a perfect honeymoon night. \n\nFast forward 3 years ... I'm back in Vegas and hungry for French food. Since my husband hates any restaurant that requires him to dress nicely, he graciously agreed to watch our toddler while my sister and I got our foodie on. I was worried that I wouldn't have the same great experience, seeing as I didn't have honeymoon magic to gloss over any imperfections the restaurant may have had the last time. I didn't have to worry at all. \n\nThey sat us right up against the window overlooking the Bellagio, and our waiter promptly arrived to take our drink orders. Although we were dying to get the chef's tasting menu again it was late, and we had a late lunch. Our waiter was attentive, helpful, and charming.... they had run out of the black cod that I wanted, but he apologized and assured me that I would not be disappointed with the halibut or sea bass. \n\nHe was right... the sea bass was delicious! Crispy skin and tender fish that matched perfectly with the smoked tomato quinoa and fennel shavings. Total heaven. This was a month ago, and I still think about that fish. I was full, but still had room for dessert. I ordered the passionfruit meringue, and it officially made my night. Tart passionfruit sorbet surrounded my light, fluffy meringue..... oh so good!!! I'm normally a creme brulee girl, but this dessert made me soo happy! The sweet and tart of the passionfruit woke me up and kept me going for the rest of the night. \n\nYes, the food is expensive. Yes, the portions are smaller than our bloated American senses are used to. But it's delicious, and the devil's in the details. I don't pay big bucks JUST for the food. I pay for the experience... a beautiful restaurant, great service, wonderful food, and a quiet moment with my sister. Always a good value in my book."

I'm SO GLAD I didn't wear my jeans - which we do ALL the time in SF.  But not to fret, I still felt their disapproval at my fleece pullover so snooty-rep intact!\n\nSis was also put in her place when she asked for a glass of Pinot & didn't specify Noir.  Gee, I'm sorry but here in Wine Country, Pinot *always* implies Noir\n\nBut fake, facetious \"french\" snootiness aside, we enjoyed our meal\n\nStarters included the Blue Cheese Souffle & let me just say this place knows how to make one mean souffle!  Light as air & just a hint of blue cheese flavor (could have been a bit more pungent but was still a fan)\n\nEntrees were the one & only veggie dish they offered - the veggie crepe.  Sis loved it but I was completely turned off by the abundance of lemon\n\nWhat did absolutely rock my world however was this Mushroom Spaetzle we got as a sidedish.  I could have had about 2 of these as a main course & been totally satiated.  Earthy, mushroomy, & tender pasta-like spaetzle.....absolutely delish!\n\nDesserts included the Banana Souffle for Sis & Pumpkin Souffle for me.  We each thought ours was the best of the 2 & again, we're greeted w/ the lightest, airiest, souffle w/ just a hint of banana or pumpkin\n\nWas hoping they'd be paired w/ something other than Creme Anglaise - like maybe a caramel pairing for the banana & a chocolate for the pumpkin but the anglaise was still tasty & didn't take away too much from our devouring\n\nPeople all around us were celebrating 1 thing or another - a couple on one side of us was celebrating a birthday & then this other couple was celebrating their very first Mommy-Son date night; and this other couple sitting right beside us got engaged right there while we were having dinner.  So much love & excitement!   \n\nAnd this is all while overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.....would totally come back for the ambiance & maybe dessert!\n\nOverall, food - 3 Stars; staff - 2 Stars; atmosphere - 5 Stars.....averaging = 3 Stars"

Other couples came in, each celebrating something: birthdays and engagements. I was concerned that my husband's birthday would be just another ho hum event and that we'd be left in the dust. But no.\n\nService was stellar. Lunch menu was varied and food was tasty. Portion sizes were perfect: not the usual Vegas-strip-enormous sized plates but servings we could actually finish. \n\nWe ordered two desserts to share which I completely recommend: creme brulee and apple streudel with cinnamon ice cream, (both ridiculously delish) and afterwards, the waiter brought out a lovely chocolate mousse on a white plate which had written in chocolate \"Happy Birthday.\"  Couldn't have asked for a lovelier lunch in all of Las Vegas.\n\nOne thing you need to know if you're going at lunch time is that the Bellaggio Fountains don't start until 3 pm on weekdays so you won't see that. Totally not the restaurant's fault! But you might want to know so you can reserve at dinnertime if you'd prefer."

I was going to Vegas with my then girlfriend for a weekend in late October 2011 and I'd decided to dine at this restaurant while I was there.  \n\nSo in  late September of 2011, based on a lot of comments that I had read on Eiffel Tower Restaurant's page on facebook, I chose to send an e-mail to make the reservation to  the (I'm assuming) operating/general manager of the restaurant, Lyle Tolhurst, letting him know when I was going to be dining there and the preferred time of arrival (between 7 or 7:30 pm) and the seat location (by the window overlooking the Bellagio Fountains so we could watch the dancing water). I also informed him that this would be my first time in Vegas and I'm trying to have a memorable experience.\n\nSoon after, Lyle responded to my request suggesting that if I should move my reservation a little bit earlier to 6:30 pm. In his own words, \"We are blessed with beautiful coral sky sunsets that fade into twilight and full darkness. If that appeals to you I would suggest a 6:30 reservation if you are not bowed in by other commitments.\"  I, of course, accepted his suggestion and made a 6:30 pm reservation for a Saturday night.\n\nFast forward to the day of the reservation, me and the ex arrived promptly at the restaurant and we were seated by the window with an amazing view of the Vegas strip and the Bellagio. To our surprise, our table had rose petals on it. Not the fake kind but REAL rose petals! Our waiter came to introduce himself and made small conversation and asked us if we wanted anything to drink (other than water). After we placed our drink orders and we were looking over the menu, our waiter came back with a small appetizer sampler plate with I think three appetizers on it. Before I was able to say, \"I didn't order this\", our waiter explained that the appetizers were given to us compliment of Lyle.\n\nThe steak that I had was great, I can't remember what my ex had but she loved it! The ambiance was nice, and the view was absolutely amazing. Lyle wasn't lying about the sunset. It was awe-some! Me and my ex had an amazing time while I was there. The only thing that I probably should have done is allow the camerawoman (there's one that offers to take your pictures with the Strip/Bellagio in the background) to take our picture. \n\nAlso, you have to try the souffle. TO DIE FOR!!!\n\nIf you're going to Vegas and you've never dined here. I absolutely recommend it. To get over the top treatment like I did, i would recommend e-mailing Lyle directly instead of making a reservation through a website like open table (which I normally use). I'm not posting his e-mail here but if you go to the restaurant's page on facebook, you'll find it pretty easily.\n\nI really couldn't ask for a better experience while I was here. I would rate this place higher than a five, but since five is highest then I guess five it is!"

And like all the rest, the portions are tiny, so get ready to drop half a bill on a meal the size of your fist and if you want wine, go in on it family style.\n\nI ordered the filet and we got a bottle of wine. My friend and I ended up drinking 80% of it and the rest went around the table.\n\nThe wine, eh, I don't know anything about wine. It was the cheapest one and it tasted like wine to me, so all good there. I would say the tiny filet was disappointing but I pretty much knew what I was in for, so no big deal there.\n\nThe atmosphere was great, as you'd expect. Very nice view. There are some parts of the eiffel support that sort of awkwardly run through the restaurant but we didn't have any issues with them.\n\nSo why did I give this place a 4? Sounds like a 3, right? It does so far, to me anyways.\n\nWell, before they give you the meals, they serve the bread. And here, the bread came in the form of these little cheese bread balls.\n\nHooooly shit, these things were incredible. I'm pretty sure I could subsist entirely on these things. It was like nirvana in my mouth. I'm pretty sure these will be an integral part of my last meal someday, and they're so soft that if I'm 120 and I've lost all my teeth by that time I should still be able to eat them. Rolled in the experienced hands of Chef Boyardee and cooked to a golden brown in what could only be St. Elmo's fire, these cheese balls were the highlight of my eating experience.\n\nCall them and see if you can get the cheese balls to go first.

Ever time we come to Vegas we always go out for a fancy dinner and this place is our number one choice. We get dressed up and enjoy ourselves. The view is jus so amazing and inside the restaurant is very romantic. From the moment you walk in they make you feel so special.\nI had the Bone-In-Pork chop, my husband had the Alaska wild black cod and we shared the creamed spinach with mushrooms and the classic potato gratin. The food was cooked perfect, it was so delicious. The apple martini was so smooth I had to have another one.\nSkip the salad and indulge in the most amazing dessert. I had the Grand Mariner Souffle, it was absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it. \nWe were there over 2 hours and they never rushed us. Most of all the atmosphere is extraordinary.\n\nFYI  if you have a drink before going to the restaurant finish it because you can not take it up stairs."

The restaurant is at the Paris hotel and offers a panoramic view of all the neighboring hotels and the strip, such as Planet Hollywood, Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Bally's, etc.  \n\nWe called to make dinner reservations and found out that they could only guarantee window seating for 5:00 and 5:15 reservations during Fall. Window seating after those times was based on availability. (Note: Their reservations require a credit card.)  Taking our chances, we made reservations for 5:45 p.m. for an anniversary dinner celebration.  We were very pleasantly surprised when we were led to one of the coveted window tables directly facing Bellagio after we arrived for dinner.  We enjoyed a leisurely dinner - first admiring the beautiful sunset behind the Bellagio hotel and then watching at least five different water fountain shows at Bellagio after the sky darkened.  I have never watched the water show from up above and it was the most amazing sight.  \n\nThe food was magnificent!  We had the beef wellington, the vegetarian crepe, a side of the potato croquettes and enjoyed the pistachio souffle for dessert.  The restaurant also gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse.  It was perfect."

Food is average at best, decent presentation and not a bad meal, but certainly not memorable. The service was below average - extremely slow, rather cold and unfriendly (with the exception of the person that escorted us up to the restaurant from the ground floor) and they never checked in on us - not once. And it was off-lunch hours (i.e. 3 pm) so there were only a handful of people seated so we are not sure the reason for he hold up. Plenty of wait staff around - just not actually coming by the tables. We could hear other guests complaining as well - one couple was comped one meal and a free dessert as they were quite vocal in their disappointment with both food and service. We didn't bother to complain - we really enjoyed the views and were glad we had the experience. However, we would not likely return nor recommend it for more than a cocktail."

As recommended by other Yelpers, I called the restaurant directly to request a view of the Bellagio so we could watch the water show.  We ended up running later than expected and I called to move our 8:30 reservation to 9:30.  They were very accommodating and let us know that our table will be ready when they get there and to take care our time.\n\nAs promised, we did get an amazing view of the Bellagio.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  She offered excellent appetizer and entree suggestions.  We never had to flag her down once to refill waters or put in drink orders.  Also, we were pleasantly surprised that she had no qualms with splitting the check between the 6 of us including 1/6 of the souffles.  From my experience, nice restaurants will not do that for you.\n\nThe food:\n- The complimentary bread included 3 different kinds but were served cold.  We would have preferred them warm.\n- Blue cheese souffle pudding: The flavors were well-balanced and the blue cheese was not overpowering.  Even my friend who hates blue cheese enjoyed this dish.\n- Heirloom tomato salad: It was refreshing and flavorful especially with the accompanying citrus basil water.\n- 2 of my friends ordered the duck and said it was the best they've ever had in their life.  \n- Me and another friend ordered the baked herb crepe.  For $27, we were both expecting better.  There was a strong flavor in there that didn't match the rest of the dish.  Perhaps parsley?  The food trailers in Austin and La Creperie make a better crepe.\n- Side of asparagus and potato gratin \n- Chocolate souffle and pistachio souffle.  You have to order them at the beginning of the meal as it takes at least 30 minutes to prepare.  They were both amazing.\n\nThe ambiance, view, service, and non-snooty atmosphere were my favorite things about the restaurant.  It's definitely a great romantic dinner spot."

We had better food and service at random local diner along the way of our drive from Texas. \n\nThe food was bad, especially the lamb burger that I ordered for lunch . The meat was too salty. The taste of lamb was non-existent. I would prefer to spend $16 for a fast-food McDonald's burger than eating that lamb burger again.\n\nMy wife ordered a BLT burger with salad on the side. Now why would you name it \"burger\" without any meat? The meatiest thing I could see was the \"prepackaged\" bacon which barely have any taste except, again, salt. And the salad... there were still dirt or spoiled leaves left. Totally unappealing. My wife lost her appetite after a single bite. We sat there waited and waited for over half an hour (not touching the food) for the waiter to show up (yeah right about good service) and guess who showed up!? The buzzer! Yup. And his job was just to clean up and fill up drinks. We then pointed at the spoiled salad and asked for the server. Yet no server came. Come to think of it, no one came to ask how we were doing with our meal the whole time we were eating there. \n\nSo, after the buzzer cleaned up the table, guess what, they dared to bring out the bill... without even asking if we wanted desert. Wow, my wife and I sat there in disbelief for a while. THEN the waiter appeared with 4 pieces of candies. Complimentary? Was that our desert? We would prefer a simple apology (which we never receive).\n\nTerrible place to eat. Period.\nJust come for the view.\n\nPro tip: You can get the \"better\" view if you pay for the Eiffel Tower elevator ride, and a better meal if you bring along a to-go McDonald, and it definitely costs less than wasting time eating in this \"restaurant.\""

They seated us at 7:30 and as we walked across the restaurant I was a little worried that we were going to the back, but no, we were seated in a great window table for two with a view of the Bellagio Fountains.  The view was awesome.  Good thing because we were there for some time!  This is somewhere you come for a long luxurious meal, if you are in a hurry, you might consider McDonalds.\n\nOur server and busser were friendly and professional, with the busser a little more attentive than the server.  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and helped me make my decisions.  I was torn between the baked herb crepes, the moroccan chicken and the arctic char and our server suggested the arctic char very highly.  I'm not a huge fan of cooked fish, but I decided to step outside of my comfort zone and I'm glad I did!  My arctic char was cooked rare, which I liked and was served ona bed of roasted beets and some pistachio crumbs.  The only thing that would have made it more delicious would have been if the pistachios were a little heavier.  I barely tasted them.\n\nMy husband had the roasted chicken with Moroccan spices and apricots with quinoa pilaf and I tasted that, too and it was DELICIOUS.  I would totally order that - the flavors are fresh and bursting with tangy-ness.  \n\nWe were happy with the drink selections as they serve Stone beers and they had my favorite champagne, Nicolas Feuillatte Brut.\n\nYou can select what type of bread you want from a tray with a small selection of different types of breads carried by the busser.  I had a baguette and then another piece of softer white bread, and he brought big pats of butter.\n\nFor dessert, I finally got to have my Chef Joho souffle, but I wasn't prepared for so many choices!  I was tempted to go with pistachio, but I ended up selecting Grand Marnier for my souffle flavor and it was delicious.  The souffle itself was soft and pillowy and the sauce made it sweet and custardy on the inside.  It was heaven and even though I've checked this off my to do list, I have to go back for more.  It's that good.\n\nI am now accepting gift cards if you would like to help a poor girl return to a fancy restaurant.  We actually did pretty good and our meal was only $130 + tip.  I could see how you could spend much, much more, but we left satisfied and happy."

If you're lucky you'll even get to see the Bellagio water show! \n\nWe shared the Beef Carpaccio for an appetizer. DELICIOUS. We gobbled up two plates of that within minutes! They then surprised us with a complimentary little shot glass full of carrot soup which was to die for. The perfect amount to keep our taste buds entertained before the main course.

I initially reserved us a table at 9:45pm (it was late since we flew from Seattle that evening).  However, due to traffic and some delays, I called the Eiffel Tower to push back the time to 10:15pm and they graciously accommodated my request despite their busy night.\n\nAt first I wasn't sure how to get there, but the friendly valets at the Paris Las Vegas happily showed us the way.  You get there through a private elevator in the middle of the casino.\n\nThe ride up the glass elevator was a perfect start to the experience, which takes us to the kitchen where you can see the busy chefs working on the meals.  We were seated by the window with a great view of the iconic Bellagio Fountains, which made the experience very romantic, with its water show coming up every 15 minutes.\n\nWe had a couple of glasses of wine --- they have a great selection.  The bread was awesome too (good bread usually means everything else is good!).  I ordered the new york steak with bone marrow and cab reduction and thoroughly enjoyed it!  My wife ordered their \"surf and turf\" offering --- prime beef strip loin with butter poached lobster.  Amazing dish.  In a city filled excesses of buffets and the like, a nice sit down dinner with perfectly sized portions is like an oasis in the desert.\n\nWe had very good service, probably because we were served by the restaurant captain, Ron Gonzales.  His service, attention and graciousness scores five stars itself.  He took lots and lots of photos of us, even suggesting that we call him when the fountains start dancing to capture a perfect shot.  He was very quick and offered wonderful suggestions, such as the chocolate souffle which is a must try.  To top it all, Ron served my wife with a complimentary chocolate pudding with a big \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate.  The pudding was decadent!\n\nMake sure you call the restaurant and advise them of what you want to do, like birthday celebrations (I hear they do proposals too).  They will work with you on your requests/demands.\n\nOverall a great experience!  Will come back again definitely!"

Kale salad, Lobster Bisque, Filet Mignon, NY Strip steak. Pre dinner complimentary cold cream of celery soup and post dinner complimentary petite fours. Served impeccably by an attentive but not intrusive staff. \nMen must wear a jacket  and collared shirt if you don't have one they will loan you one. Be prepared to drop $250 minimum and more likely $300 plus for 2 people. It is worth it.."

            "review": "My girlfriend and I just so happened to be in Vegas at the one year, eight month mark in our relationship. We were originally planning to get dinner at some Cheesecake Factory-esque restaurant, but when we were walking around Paris, we decided to go with Eiffel Tower Restaurant to make it a memorable night.\n\nWe were in town because she had a singing competition at Planet Hollywood. It ran longer than we thought, and in the process I had to push back our 9:35 reservation at the last minute. The staff was very accommodating and understanding, and I really appreciated that. When we arrived ten minutes late, I showed up in a t-shirt and shorts, which, in my defense, was comfortable attire for attending a competition! But of course, not acceptable for a nice, fancy dinner. Definitely my bad! So we speed-walked back to Bally's so I could change into my collared shirt and dress pants. Ended up arriving at around 10:10. Big props goes to the staff of Eiffel Tower for dealing with my follies in such a patient, professional manner!\n\nNow for dinner, we had a beautiful view of the Strip and Bellagio's beautiful fountain show in front of us. That alone was pretty memorable. We were treated very well by the staff, who offered us bread on a nice platter, giving us the option to choose which type of bread we wanted. Before our food was served, we were offered a nice sampling of asparagus soup, which was creamy and delicious. \n\nFor our entrees, she ordered the vegetarian option, the Baked Herbed Crepes while I ordered the Beef Wellington which came with a nice wine sauce on the side. Overall the food was good, and having never had a filet mignon baked into a pastry, it was pretty interesting -- in a good way! The wine sauce gave the dish a distinctive sweet, defined taste. My girlfriend's crepes were pretty good too, from what she let me sample... haha.\n\nOur dessert was the Yelp-recommended pistachio souffl\u00e9, which was nice and delicate. We were also given a choice of chocolates from a platter to round out the night. A nice shout-out goes to Reed, our amazing and efficient server for contributing to an wonderful and memorable dinner experience. Will definitely be back again, and will be recommending this place to family and friends. Thanks, Eiffel Tower Restaurant, for giving my girlfriend and I a great memory!"

The meal I had here was hands down one of the best, if not maybe even the best (or maybe I'm just saying this cause I can't afford to eat like this anymore since I moved to Europe) meal I've ever had. You can't get foie gras in California anymore, so of course I had to go with the legit tournedo rossini, which was pretty much, and I don't know if I've ever used this word in a review, probably not on Yelp at any rate, orgasmic. Yes, orgasmic people, I said it. It was melt in your mouth, and the textures and the flavors, me oh my. The foie gras was velvety and a great contrast to the tenderness of the filet. I don't think I even used a knife, didn't have to, I kind of just sliced through with my fork because it was like butter.\n\nI also splurged, cause I like to go big on vacation and this was one of my last meals in the states, on the raw seafood platter. Yes it will break the bank, but again, so fresh and so clean. The lobster tail, crab legs, oysters and mussels, basically tasted like they had just been caught and brought to your table in under an hour, which we all know in the middle of the desert, wouldn't be possible, but my taste buds enjoyed thinking that it was. \n\nVery pricey, but you know what they say in Vegas (well other than the thing about blackmail fodder staying there, cause with facebook I think they had to scrap that particular ad campaign) go big or go home!"

Luckily we were able to get a seat by the window with an amazing view and I was mesmerized by the fountains. Being my first time in Las Vegas I am glad I went, but next time I am in Vegas I doubt I will go to ETR. Not saying I won't go back ever, just wasn't as blown away by the food as I was expecting. I have mixed feelings about the staff. They were polite and attentive, but there were times I felt they were a bit snobby and not accommodating. The host at the front of the house annoyed me at the beginning - we were about 5 minutes late for our reservation, our fault I realize, but they made us wait about 30 minutes. The host was not extremely helpful trying to make me feel better about this and made it worse by how much he referred to us being late. I mean yes we were late, but 5 minutes? Anyway, once we finally got our table with such an awesome view I was very happy and in a great mood. We had several questions about the wine selection which seemed to annoy our server. Otherwise, the service was fine just not the best I've had at fine dining establishments. For the price I was expecting stellar service and food. My boyfriend and I have been to some great fine dining French restaurants (The French Room in Dallas being our favorite). For two people, we ended up spending just over $200.\n\nWith all that said, the food was very good and overall our night was very enjoyable. If I return to Las Vegas with someone who hasn't been to Vegas before, I would go back to ETR for the ambiance. If bf and I return within the next couple of years, we will go elsewhere."

An early reservation allowed for a window table over looking the Bellagio water show.The sun was setting behind the Bellagio making it a perfect view for the water show. Our server ,John Figlietti, was a true professional. He was timely,observant,informative and personable. My son had the salmon, judging by his smile, left little doubt as to how satisfied he was. I had the NY strip which was a generous proportion and perfectly prepared, absolutely delicious. As the restaurant started to fill up @ 1900 we were ordering desert. We found the close proximity of the window tables to be a plus. It allowed for brief exchanges with our neighbors who were enjoying the views as well. The entire evening was a pleasure !"

The filet mignon melts in your mouth accompanied by a perfect wine reduction sauce. The potatoes au gratin is delicious and good to share. The timing of the service is right on, not too long and not too rushed. Mention a special occasion and you will get a special dessert.

Me and my GF decided to go to this place to check this place out for the July 4th weekend and had an amazing experience.  \n\nFirst the service is amazing.  We arrived and the person at the escalator showed us the way to the restaurant.  The servers were very courteous and knowledgeable about the food being served.  I asked for a recommendation and our server suggested the sea bass and it did not disappoint.  Our server name was George and he did everything he could to make our visit an enjoyable one.  Thanks George!\n\nThe food was overall spot on for me.  The sea bass was lightly crispy on the outside and very flavorful on the inside.  I also go to try fore groie.  It's supposed to be duck liver and it was fused with some cherries.  I am glad I tried it, but I will definitely not order it again in the future.  Just not my kind of dish.  We ended our meal with pistachio and gran broule souffles.  First time I ever had souffle and now I understand what the fuss is all about.  I am now a souffle fan!\n\nLastly the ambiance of the place is very nice and with a great view.  Make sure to request for a window view.  It is well worth the extra 15 minute wait.  I was lucky enough to sit at a window table and go to see the Bellagio water show every 15 minutes.  Then we enjoyed the firework show that was being displayed at Cesar's Palace.  It was quite a memorable night for us.\n\nAll this does come at a price.  Total bill for me n my GF was $200, but the experience was priceless.  I am glad I had the chance to dine at such an exquisite restaurant.  \n\nTIP: I showed up in a t-shirt and jeans.  Make sure to wear a collar shirt or else they will provide you with a jacket.  Also do not wear shorts because I saw some guy having to put on loaner slacks.  \n\nBon Appetit!!!"

The elevator attendant was basically Helena Bonham Carter straight out of Sweeney Todd but I chalk that up to giving the restaurant character instead of being incredibly creepy. The great news is that every table is a good table. The restaurant is surrounded by floor to ceiling windows that give you a view of the strip. I was seated right next to the window so I had a great view of the Bellagio fountain show that popped up every so often. \n\nI don't know if all of the wait staff is French, but if not, they fake it really well and add to the ambience. I get that this can be a really special moment for some people but the little blonde teenage girl walking around with an impressively sized camera is a little unnecessary. It made for an awkward moment but I guess the intentions were kind. The food was great. It wasn't out of this world but  I enjoyed it and that along with the view definitely makes it a place that I would recommend!"

This is an upscale restaurant that has a very nice upscale vib with great views of the the strip and the fountains at the Bellagio. I was amazed that even here, they allow the Vegas slob wear that is so prevalent in Las Vegas. We went here before a show and dressed accordingly for a nice upscale restaurant, and found that over half of the patrons were in slob wear. Certainly takes away from the experience. The service was impeccable, the food was very good, the view was great, the prices were extremely high, as is most of the nice restaurants in the Las Vegas area. For a dinner for two with two glasses of wine with tip was $250. There were several people using some type of dinner promotion here they were limited to a short menu and predetermined items, that was a lot cheaper, so this is one option to consider. We enjoyed our dinner as we were celebrating 40 years of marriage, but we would probably not go back due to the unrealistic pricing. This is by far the most expensive meal that we have ever had for the two of us."

Ask for club soda to be mixed in to make it less overpowering. \n\nWe started with the creamy French Onion soup - I've never had french onion soup in this form (creamy) before but it was really yummy. \n\nNext  we ordered the ocean seafood salad (lobster, shrimp, crab) to share.

Someone puts you in an elevator and another person escorts you off of it and to your section. No one can come or go unless permitted by the elevator monitors. There were at least 4 individuals constantly circling the room, offering bites, checking for drink orders, and clearing away used dishes. \n\nMy cocktail wasn't great. It was a flavorless Cosmo.

The goat cheese filled dates, mini lamb burgers, and parmesan bread balls (none of these are probably the correct names) were my favorite. My guess is that the actual menu items are even better.

We get a table over looing the strip (nice).  \n\nOur server comes and asks if we would like to order a bottle of wine, and I said yes of course.  A sommelier comes by and asks what are my preferences.  I don't like reds, nor do I like dry whites.  I said I like the sweeter and fruitier variety.  She comes back with this Sauvignon Blanc I forget what but it had lychee in it.  Oh my God!  The best wine I have ever had and I'm a fool for forgetting the name.  \n\nWe get our choice of breads and we ordered our food.  I got the Lamb Chop with escarole and potato puree.  MMMMM the sauce that came with it...I would have drunk it till I drowned.  we also ordered Scalloped Potatoes, Mushrooms, and Asparagus with Lemon Jus to share.  All great sides with my meal.  My friend ordered the Steak Au Puoive and was delicious the peppercorn sauce was not as over powering as I would have thought.  Friend number 2 ordered the Chillean Sea Bass with Roasted Vegetables- probably my least favorite but it was still good.  Friend number 3 Pan Seared Chicken with Meyer Lemon Jus and Hari Cot Verts- really good chicken was moist, nothing spectacular though.  Friends number 4 Roasted Wild Salmon with balsamic reduction and roasted figs- interesting dish, lots of flavor, but I have to say I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it was prepared with a different type of fish.  Dessert?  My friend got a shot glass with a Cappaccino Mousse along with chocolate caligraphy saying Happy 25th Birthday!  Forever tormenting his demise of turning 25 in his quarter life crisis.

The servers are non-attentive and extremely scripted versus being genuine, if they even speak English.  I would goto STK over this place all day long.  Get a room with a view and order room service, you will be happier and probably save a buck."

Or maybe ordering the Venison Medium and having it come out blood red and cold.  Or making reservations three weeks in advance and getting seated facing away from the \"Strip\" overlooking the parking deck in a converted  room  designed for storage but used for dinning.  I was told that they had 700 reservations for the night. My wife had the Lamb, with a side of undercooked Cold tomato ratatouille. We think this is what got us sick. If you want to have a $100 per person dinner, have terrible underprepared food and be put in perhaps the worst seat in a restaurant that promotes it's view and be sick the next day then call the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, they will be happy to accomadate."

We had dinner at the palm in caesar's the night before and it was disappointing. The Eiffel tower made up for that. \n\nThe restaurant is romantic and nice with an awesome view of the strip and the bellagio water show. I had the lamb chops with foie gras $48. The bf had the duck breast $39. The side we chose was the potatoes croquette $10. The lamb chops was really good and tender but u only get 2. I guess I didn't pay attention to the dish description bc the foie gras is what makes it so expensive. I didn't know and tried it and then figured out what it was. So that was the only disappointment. Rather would've had extra lamb instead. Haha. The bf's duck breast was really yummy too. Nice and tender and moist. The potato croquettes were ok. I'd choose another side next time. For dessert we had the chocolate souffle $15. When they bring it out the server makes a hole and drizzles in melted chocolate which makes it extra rich. I would have preferred to do that myself. The parts not drenched in melted chocolate was less sweet and tasted very light. I would ask them to not pour it in if you prefer it not be so sweet. \n\nIn addition for my bday we got a small chocolate parfait with happy birthday on it which was very nice. And then they also bring out petit desserts to choose 1 to try. The service here is amazing. The atmosphere is awesome. There's also a photographer to take your pic with the Paris sign in the background. It's $24 for a 5x7 and they also email you the pic to have as a digital copy and add to your phone pics. Overall really like this place for a romantic dinner. It's super fancy but guys only need to wear a collared shirt. The hostesses wear long black gowns. And servers wear tuxedo like outfits bowtie and all."

The atmosphere is elegant, yet lively, with art-deco inspired fixtures and furnishings complementing a spectacular view of the strip.  The staff is warm and attentive, without being intrusive.  And, the menu...an absolute delight.  You can choose from Chef Joho's exquisite seven course signature tasting menu or extensive a la carte selection.  I highly recommend the warm lobster salad with garlic braised artichokes.  A superb blend of flavors and textures.  The roast rack of lamb is also quite wonderful.  Cooked to perfection with a crisp herb crust drizzled with a tarragon jus.  Make sure you save room for dessert.  The souffl\u00e9s are not to be missed....I recommend either the pistachio or grand marnier.....and the raspberry napoleon is splendid.  Also, don't be surprised if you're visited by the Eiffel Tower's Manager, Laurent Ertle, during your dining experience.  He works to make sure that every guest is treated with exceptional care.  I've now been to the restaurant about a half-dozen times and each experience has been marvelous and memorable.  One final note, prices are what you would expect from a fine restaurant, but they are realistic, not inflated, and the value is outstanding."

Much of the main courses were underseasoned, the sauces were fair (suprisingly), 3 of our meat dishes were overdone, the fish was a bit too dry, & appetizers (except for the savory foie gras)were fair & not quite the 4 or 5 star experience we expected.  For those foodies willing to spend $$$$ for French cuisine in LV we'd recommend: Joel Robuchon @ MGM, Twist @ the Mandalay, or Guy Savory @ Ceasars for a 4/5 star dining feast!!"

They only take window seat reservations at the 430 seating but we lucked out. We ordered the Escargot which was delicious, the Butternut Squash soup with Duck and a Beet Salad. The flavor of the soup with the Duck in it was incredible.  For our  main course we ordered the Beef Wellington that was worth the price and seasoned and cooked to perfection.

We ask to sit near the fountains overview-didn't happen and they weren't busy at all. I've had 100% better French Onion Soup at a non-French regular old diner joint than here. The French onion soup was creamy like a broc cheese/onion soup and no cheese/bread/or real onion just a thick puree. Secondly, service took forever and after 30 min of waiting for our meals when they weren't even busy at like 2:00pm they told us they were out of steak. So my fiance's mom had to pick something else when she thought we would be getting our meal by then. The blt was good but for the price no way! Only difference was they put avocado on their blt-big whoop and you can get blt's anywhere. I was expecting more exotic French foods. Not overpriced American food and crappy French version of French soup."

This set the tone for the dining experience.\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't here to have dinner. I had just met up with my former casino professor turned good friend, and we were thirsty. \n\nWe sat at the bar in a way where we could overlook the LV Boulevard and the Bellagio fountains. As many of the other reviews state, the view is exceptional. A perfect date spot with that special someone. However, we were here to get lit. He started with some gin martini, I went for the manhattan on the rocks. At $20 a pop it doesn't come cheap, but if you were to imagine the perfect manhattan, this would surely be it. After a couple drinks each we were feeling all warm and fuzzy.\n\nWe ordered the French cheese board and crab salad to hold us over. The cheeses were phenomenal! I don't recall exactly what cheeses they were, but they covered a broad spectrum of cheeses. From bold and pungent, to creamy and luscious. The bartender also supplied us with plenty of extra crostinis to accompany our cheeses. We also had the crab salad. The crab was so sweet and wrapped in thinly sliced cucumbers, and surrounded by a small bed of greens. Definitely not filling at all, but a nice treat.\n\nOverall a good experience. Pricey, but worth it. Bon appetit!"

Server strongly suggested we have a BLT or hamburger which we were not interested in and ordered steaks as we wished along with a Cadillac margarita but received a standard version. Now the real issue was two- fold the server obviously lost track of our order as our plates were cleared after our salad and table crumbed and then a host/manager came over and asked how was everything and we let him know we had not even eaten yet as it seems our table was mixed up with the one next to us, perhaps? Waiter never came by and checked on us and offered no apology when we informed him we never received our lunch as he also was asking if we wanted dessert as well. We finally received our meals and although ordered medium rare for both we both received raw, very raw and pretty poor quality steaks. I sent mine back but my wife was going to deal with hers until she  decided she could no  longer so she just left it. Got a re-fire,again with no apology. I do not like to complain but I felt I had to look for a manager and after seeking one out because our waiter was missing of course we in the end did receive a visit from Sharon  who was very helpful and understanding and we were able to show her the raw steak which she agreed was raw. Sharon was outstanding and apologetic and took care of the check as well as offering up dessert (Creme Brulee which was excellent) She did ask that we go through her for a reservation next time we are in town and she assured good results. With that said after this experience and the quality of the steak I just can't see going here for dinner and expecting high quality food or service so we will most likely pass. This was an extremely dissatisfying experience and surely the most disappointing one in a high end type place. The lunch took about an hour and 40 minutes filled with errors. 20th anniversary lunch what a mess."

First time, my friend and I was tired of the crowds and the strollers. I was tempted to kick one out of the way. Why bring babies in LV? So we saw the menu for lunch. We didnt have a reservation but got in right away and a great view of the strip by the window. Of course this place is a prime photo spot. Unfortunately our camera batteries was dying. It couldnt handle Vegas either. We had a soup, shared an appetizer, mineral water, and dessert. Just perfect for the budget. I went several other times  - never got an entree. Just recently, another college friend and I had a 6 hours layover on the way to Bay Area. we grabbed a cab, hung on the strip and had dessert with sweet wine by the bar. This was on THANKSGIVING day. Flights are cheap on that afternoon. People was dressed beautifully. So if you come for dinner, dress code! oh, even though we sat by the bar, we could see the Bellagio fountains beautifully. Our cameras was fully charged and we took so many photos. \n\nThe bar is a must go! They know their stuff. We were actually on our way to Napa Valley and the sommelier was discussing which wineries in Napa is good to go. Since I am from the Bay I was able to hold a good conversation about recommended places - we both ended up writing for each other. Not only that, he remembered me from the other times I came to Vegas! The service here is amazing. They saw I had a big bag and didnt want to lug it around, they put it away in a safe place for me. But But BUT.... the kicker is........the souffle....is the most amazing ever. I grew up eating French food so take it from me. ITS THE BEST! I especially loved the pistachio one and was tempted to lick it off. Good thing I was in a classy place. Plus I dont want to end up on a viral video somewhere. So this place has class - dress nice - delicious food/dessert/wine, amazing view, more isolated from the crowd yet right smack in the middle of the strip. Hence why it gets my vote of FIVE stars. Don't believe me? I was there just last week."

Phenomenal.  \n\nMain\nMe:  Venison Chop\nBoyfriend:  Rack of Lamb\nSide Dish:  Brussels Sprouts\nAs tender and amazing as the meat was on my chop, the star of the plate was the little oatmeal cake it was served with.  For many restaurants the starch is kind of an afterthought (\"Umm, yeah let's throw some potatoes on here to take up space\").  I am still thinking about that sublime little round of deliciousness a month later.  \n\nTo my absolute surprise we learned from the it is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant from the lovely manager who visited our table and chatted with it.  I wholeheartedly recommend this as a great special event restaurant.  \n\nAnd please fellow Yelpers, DRESS APPROPRIATELY.  Yes, it is Vegas where you can wear a tee shirt and jeans 99% of the time, but this is the 1% of the time you shouldn't.  I know you'll argue that you are paying good money so why should you dress up for others but go ahead and wear those heels and dress shoes.  Enjoy it.  Savor the fanciness.   It is a special meal, so relax and enjoy it for what it is.  You deserve it, right?"

We booked a table well in advance and the manager seated us himself at a romantic table for 2 overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.  It was the most romantic spot in the entire city.  The service was truly professional.  They kept the wine flowing and anticipated every need we could have.  The food was incredible.  I got the duck and my husband got whitefish, neither disappointed.\nWe were worried this place would be all hype because of the location, but it deserves every good review.  Worth eating here at least once."

Probably the most expensive meal I've had in my life though.  Dinner for 2 ran me anywhere from $200 - $250 depending if alcohol was involved or not.  Was it worth it?  I think so.  This is one of those restaurants where they offer just more than good gourmet French food.  Ordered their rack of lamb all 3 times, and even though I felt that it was on the salty side, it may have been that salt that brought the flavor out.  The meat was cooked to perfection.  Their scalloped potatoes al gratin and their creamed spinach were excellent, but all a-la-cart so that's how the final bill became so pricey.  Their service was impressive to say the least and I felt we had our own personal waiter.  Very attentive.  The ambiance is very upper crust and romantic, but I didn't feel uncomfortable one bit.  The best thing about this place is the view.  Spectacular views of the Vegas strip and we literally had a front row seat of the famous Bellagio water park so we has some pretty nice entertainment to go along with dinner.  Felt like I was on top of the world!  This is a must go to restaurant if you're trying to impress a date and want to have one of those unforgettable evenings that should of course stay in Vegas.  :)"

My husband got the vegetarian crepes (the only vegetarian item on the menu) and found them pleasing at first, but overpowering after a few bites. I tasted it, too - it's like whoever created it didn't actually try to sit down and eat a whole one.\n\nFor me, the lobster was so tough and stringy that I had a difficult time cutting it with a knife. No delicious dessert can make up for that sort of problem. \n\nOh, I forgot, we ordered sides as well. The potato croquettes were pretty good as long as they were piping hot. Once the temperature went more toward warm, you could taste the grease, which to me is not ideal.\n\nI'm happy to pay a premium for a great meal/service/ambience, but I expected much better from this place, especially in Vegas where competition is stiff."

The salmon was about right - not outstanding, but salmon very rarely is.  Short-ribs were somewhere between good and great (lacked that extra oomph to blow my mind).  The chocolate mousse and ice cream dessert (cannot remember what it was actually called) was outstanding.  Side dishes varied from average (creamed spinach) to perfect (green beans almondine).\n\nThey also had a Cote de Nuits Pinot by the glass (+1), which I was very excited about. Fantastic wait staff too.\n\nHowever, -1 because when we first went in, the host staff tried to put us in the very back of the restaurant looking out into an alley or something; I didn't bother to look long enough to figure it out, but quite frankly that back corner should not even be a part of the dining room in a restaurant of this caliber.  Normally this wouldn't be an issue worth writing about (I understand a restaurant being busy), except there were numerous empty tables in the main dining area.  I don't know why we were shown a clearly inferior table first and were only seated in the main area when we declined and prepared to leave. I chalked it up to miscommunication among the staff or something like that.\n\nSo, it was expensive ($100/pp for us) but I left pretty content."

After our food took too long we asked what's taking so long he first said \"want to cancel\" then said 3 minutes which turned into 15. Of course we canceled and left. But the point is it was like he enjoyed it. As we left I saw the manger standing around I told him what had taken place. His reaction was a half ass apology.

My boyfriend and I did a little gambling and day drinking before dinner and his stomach wasn't doing the best.  So we sit down to our table and the waiter was pompous.  He took our drink order, I got champagne and my boyfriend (not feeling the best) got water.  The waiter looked at him in shock and said, \"you know you can order a drink, I didn't ask for I.D.\"  My jaw hit the freaking floor.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  First off, he is well above the drinking age and I.D. is irrelevant.  Second, he is a grown man and can order for himself.  Thirdly, what if he were an alcoholic and couldn't drink.  So right off the bat we start off on the wrong foot.  So our drinks come and a bus boy brings me a water that has a bug in it.  I call the waiter over and say, \"I'm sorry, but there is a bug in my drink\".  The waiter takes the glass and doesn't say a word, not a sorry, nothing.  Immediately he comes back with water.  Because of his attitude and the quickness that he brought the water back, I am assuming he didn't pour me a new glass but just flicked the bug out of the water.  I address this with the waiter and tell him that I want the check and I want to leave.  He calls the manager over and I tell her everything that has happened.  She offers to start over, but by that time my night was ruined.  I looked at her and said, if you guys can't get my water right, how can I trust you to get my meal right?!?.  So, now everything is booked for dinner for Memorial Day and we went to Benihanna's because they could take us\nUPDATE - A manager contacted me shortly after I wrote this review.  He not only made me feel better about the experience but went above and beyond to correct it.  That is customer service I can get behind.  Mistakes happen, and the staff truly represents the restaurant however one bad apple shouldn't spoil the bunch, especially when I see all the nice reviews of this restaurant"

Yes, it's pricey, but this is what is expected in Las Vegas and the nature of the restaurant, right? \n\nService could have been better. Our server appeared distant and seemed to never smile.  The woman who helped clear our table periodically was very nice and sweet, however. \n\nGo at least once to try for yourself. We went for brunch, cheaper price but same view.

Need I say more?\n\nThe lights were dim and the ambience was very romantic. Our server, Maria was very helpful in making suggestions and answering some questions we had about the menu. After taking our order, we were presented with diff types of bread we could choose from to start out with. I got the multigrain which was hard, and the bf got the baguette, which was alright. Here's what we ended up having after the bread:\n1. Tasting plate(asparagus w/goat cheese, duck pate w/pork, and some kind of tomato bisque w/shrimp)- asparagus and cheese was deelish, bisque was ok, pate was \"real good\" according to my bf.\n2 . Appetizers( thinly sliced salmon w/toast and a side of capers,onions, and creme fresh and escargot w/bacon and red wine reduction)- salmon was real good but probably would've gone better with a diff type of toasted bread rather than reg bread. We both couldn't get ourselves to finish the escargot. I don't know if it was the red wine reduction or what, but it tasted like liver and blood.\n3. Entrees- The bf got the surf and turf with a side of potato gratin and I got the Mediterranean sea bass and a side of creamed spinach and mushroom. According to the bf the steak was \"perfectly seasoned(peppercorn) and juicy\" while the lobster was just tasty. The potato gratin was also good and very light. My fish was real good BUT it was sitting on top of  bread crumb and some kind of sauce which was very sour. I ended up eating the fish with the spinach and mushroom which turned out real good, but opted out of the bread crumb and that sour sauce.\n4. Dessert- Ofcourse we had the souffle, which was ok for me but orgasmic to the bf. Then they brought out sorbet samples. Flavors were: mango, strawberry, chocolate, and sour cream(the best). Second best was chocolate, then mango, then strawberry.We then had chocolate mousse and cappuccino, both were awesome.\n\nDinner then ended with a 263 dollar check, but was very much worth it. It was just a great anniversary dinner and we couldn't be any happier. We already have plans coming back on our decade anniversary next year!\n\nWhat a great night we had here! From the food to the views, everything was amazing!"

I was here with my friend to celebrate her birthday and made my reservation way in advance to for 5:15pm to guarantee a window seat to view the sunset. Turns out the sunset time for the date was for 7:50pm. So I guess we were expected to sit for approximately 3 hours.\n \nAtmosphere: We had a table towards the back of the restaurant, but it did have a pretty good view of the Bellagio fountain. The temperature of the place was nice and cool because there were only about 10 tables that night. It was not packed at all so the noise level was good.\n \nFood: We were not that hungry when we arrived being an early dinner, so we decided not to do the tasting menu and ordered a le carte. We ordered 2 cocktails (Pink Velvet, The Eiffel Affair), two appetizers (Casco Bay Jumbo Sea Scallop, Red Wine Marinated Quail), two entrees (Black Cod, Altantic Salmon), and the Pistachio Souffle dessert to share. The food was all delicious, but the quail was a bit rough. Even though it was marinated, it lacked flavor in the meat so the sauces made up for that. The black cod was really good at first but it became a bit saltier towards the end as I was finishing it.\n \nService: This is really where I dropped the star for this place. After being greeted and lead to the table, our waiter, Mario, came by to ask us what type of water and asked if we were interested in wine or cocktails. My friend ask for the beverage menu and he came back with the just the wine list. It was later on when another gentlemen in a grey suit who came by that we request the cocktail list from him. After placing our orders for the appetizers and entrees, we didn't see our waiter much after that. Our waiter made us feel like he just didn't care. Our food was brought out to us wrong. It's only the two of us and he still couldn't get it right who's food it belongs to? He was busy attending to the table next to us with the family of four for the most part. He did not let us know that the souffle took about 20 minutes to prepare until after we ordered it. Whereas the other table, he went over to ask if they would like to put in the order in advance half way towards their entree so they don't have to wait for it. They came in after us and ordered after us, but was given their dessert first. Also, the other table next to us had flowers on the table because their dinner was for an anniversary celebration, but we didn't even get a card anything. Even a simple steak house would have had some kind gestures. I did saw the other waiter brought out a mini dessert with Happy Birthday written on the plate for one of the table (HEY, WHERE IS OURS?!)\n \nI honestly felt that the whole experience with the restuarant was dragged down by the service we received. I did notice that the table of two next to us had a very pleasant waiter who was much more patient and attentive. They have a staff who provides consistently good service to everyone. Overall, the view was very nice and the food was good (not blow you away good), but service was a let-down. To create a great dining experience, all three aspects should be present, even if not all at the greatest, but at least at a fairly good level. I would have thought a place like this would know that. Our check was nearly $250, I definitely expected more from it."

I had the French Onion Soup to start and didn't expect it to be creamy, so I was a little skeptical at first, but it ended up being very yummy.  All the flavors were perfect.  For dinner, I had the Filet Mignon and it was good, but it was undercooked.  I asked for medium and it was more medium-rare.  The meat was tender though.  For dessert, I had creme brulee.  It was quite good and a big portion.  Mine was perfectly cooked, but others at my table said their's was a little soupy.  All in all, I would recommend coming here.  The food was delicious and the view was excellent."

            "review": "We came here with OpenTable reservations and they didn't follow through with the seat views request that was made with the OpenTable reservation. On top of waiting for an additional 20 minutes for normal tables (even though we made advance reservations), we didn't even get a view. They said we'd have to wait an even longer for a table with a view if we wanted a view that badly. Since we were already hungry, we decided not to wait any longer.\n\nOur order:\n\nMarket Greens ($18), Black Cod ($44), Loup de Mer ($48), and Pistachio Souffle ($16). \n\nLoved the taste of the Market Greens - Avocado, sunflower seeds, sherry walnut vinaigrette. It sounds normal, but the taste was perfect! Very well balanced!! The Crispy Loup de Mer was also fabulous! It included spinach leaves, peanut potatoes, bacon and red wine lobster jus that was quite delicious! \n\nA favorite that all can agree on: Pistachio Souffl\u00e9!! I'm typically not a big dessert person, but wow...the pistachio souffl\u00e9 is mouth watering goodness!! And as a pistachio lover, whoa! Perfect taste!! I was surprised I could taste the wonderful pistachio flavor and of course the souffl\u00e9 was cooked to perfection! \n\nOverall service was okay. Our server answered any questions we had but didn't think to ask if we had any preferences. Maybe he was too busy? \n\nLet's just say, thank goodness the food and of course the famous Pistachio Souffl\u00e9 was perfect! If not...this would have been a terrible experience with one star. I am giving it only 3 stars because I may not come back again for the price that didn't correlate with the lack of service given. \n\nWhen I'm giving a rating, it isn't solely based on the food, it's based on various aspects of the restaurant (service, timing, etc.). So, for $$$$ establishment, I expected better. Since it wasn't as great as expected from such a pricey establishment, I cannot give it the stars to match it's price tag. \n\nIf you need an example of a wonderful restaurant, check out my other reviews of a wonderful spot in Vegas that is $$$$ :D\n\nD\u00e9sol\u00e9!"

            "review": "Ever since I was a little girl and my family would travel to Vegas for my dad's work, I wanted to go up the Eiffel Tower at the Paris hotel. Well, I finally got to do that during a work trip of my own AND I got to eat at the restaurant. That was definitely one of the highlights of my trip because the food was exquisite (almost said \"amazing\" but I wanted to try a classier word to match with this classy place ;) )!\n\nI made reservations through Open Table and was advised on their strict dress code. Luckily I brought a dress, otherwise my jeans or shorts wouldn't have cut it. So FYI, be prepared for that. As soon as we stepped foot in the elevator to take us up, I was already impressed by the service. Our waiter was so attentive and seated us by the windows so we could get a good view of the Bellagio water show. He also made sure to get our food out quickly because we had to be out of there to make it to a show. \n\nI started with a glass of Riesling and the Blue Cheese Souffl\u00e9 Pudding with Petite Salad. It had a little Eiffel Tower picture on it, which meant it was a favorite...and not only can I see why, but I'm still thinking about how delicious that dish was! The souffle was perfect, not too stiff and not too soft (sorry, that's the best I can do to describe it!). The flavor was not too intense even though blue cheese usually is, so that made it even better!\n\nFor my entree, I had Olive Oil Poached Halibut and Herbed Couscous with Tomato Basil. Fish is usually not something I order, but I wanted something light and this was highly recommended. WOWWW. That's all I can say. Try it. You'll love it. Both the fish and the couscous were seasoned just right and I felt like every bite just melted in my mouth. \n\nThe portions weren't huge...I mean, it's a fancy restaurant so I was expecting tiny! But they were just right. I would have tried a dessert, but we had to go. I'll do that next time I go back!"

Not sure if the wine we had was really worth the $120 a bottle, but it's one of those special occasion/once in a lifetime meals.  And the wine was phenomenal and didn't give me a headache the next day :)\n\nThe food is absolutely amazing!! Get anything on the menu.  It doesn't matter.  It will knock you off your feet!  I love the amuse-bouche that is included with your meal.  \n\nThe service was impeccable, as was to be expected.  I liked the pace the wait staff made the dinner flow: not too fast, not too slow.\n\nMake sure to get the chocolate souffle!! You will thank me later.  I've only had chocolate souffle a few times before and this was by far the best desert I've ever had... EVER!  They serve the souffle with a side of chocolate sauce that gets poured into the middle of the souffle.  The souffle drank up the sauce like a sponge!\n\nLastly, make sure you get a seat by the window.  The Bellagio fountain goes off every 15 minutes and provides a fantastic backdrop for a fantastic meal.\n\nSo, overall... make this a special occasion night (if you have any money left when you're in Vegas) and enjoy!"

This has been on our bucket list for the past several years and we finally made the splurge for our anniversary.  Overlooking all of the bright lights of the Las Vegas strip, you get to enjoy some real fine dining that the Paris has to offer.\n\nWe had two of our dear friends join us for dinner who also happen to be very good business colleagues.  Visiting us all the way from Pittsburgh we wanted to show them a great time.  This place did not disappoint.  From the minute we sat down, we were greeted with a really nice and comfortable red velvet booth overlooking the strip.  We ordered drinks, which were very excellent by the way; the Pink Velvet and Can Can.  Definitely a sweet and sour type of alcoholic drink made to perfection.  My only gripe was that the drink was served in a champagne glass instead of a larger cocktail type glass.  Still a good drink to definitely start the buzz for the night.\n\nOur entrees consisted of the Free Range Chicken and the Imperial Beef Wellington.  Both excellent meals and I did not leave the plate empty at all.  I told the server I was concerned with the beef wellingtons having some pink, but it did not.  Was served medium well and certainly did not disappoint.  It also came with a red blood looking sauce (I forgot the name), but it really enhanced all of the savory flavors.  I will definitely be coming back here to try the multi-course meal; apparently all parties in the group must order it.  Great excuse to come back.  Excellent place for cozy, quiet and romantic evenings.  Be prepared to spend $125-$150 per person, but well worth it."

The nice bartender made us a couple of amazing (expensive) drinks and then our table was ready. \n\nOkay even though this place is super expensive I truly believe the view we had totally made up for it. Our table was right in front of the Bellagio water show! Super romantic and perfect for the occasion. \n\nThe food was pretty good, had the pork belly appetizer and we both got the veal medallions. It was tasty but I was still kinda hungry after....  its fine dining so I expected high prices for small portions. The staff (hostesses, bartender, server, busser) were all wonderful. \n\nOverall this is a very good place to impress your date or for a special occasion but if you just want some really good french food on the strip I would say to go try Bouchon in Venetian."

We have dined in so many places previous to finding this absolute GEM. I couldn't possibly cover all the superlatives this Restaurant deserves! We enjoyed a reasonably priced bottle of Wine. I had the Bone Marrow Steak & hubby had the Filet. A wonderful Lobster Salad & potato side dish and great Bread/Rolls selection. Next: The View of the Fountains and piano playing softly in the backround in a dimly lit room all comes together with the attentive service of the staff. Sommelier is spot on with wine suggestions. Next time I'd also like to try one of their specialty cocktails. Anything to stay longer and take in the whole experience! Ask for a table at the window for an exceptional view of the strip and fountains. Lyle was so helpful and our server Michael was terrific ! Some mini appetizers, a palette of asst. sorbets and a chocolate mousse were sent over compliments of ET! Wonderful !\nTreat yourself to this experience of a lifetime. You only live once.\nAnd I cannot wait until next year. We could not even consider another place that could top ET for a wonderful meal/experience all the way around. A big Thank You to everyone there for our special memories !!!\nCheck out their Facebook Fan Page for more info! Trip Advisor loves them too!"

Potato chips were served on the side $18.\n\nEiffel Tower Burger a classic well cooked yummy burger also served with potato chips.

The filet mignon with the red wine vinagrette marinade was beyond belief. It was as if 1,000 cherubs finished in my mouth!!!!  The place is dim, but has enough light to see your food and overlooking the Vegas strip is a damn near unbeatable backdrop. Also if you have a good seat you can clealy view the Bellagios water show. I'm pretty sure this restaurant has a sister location in Heaven!!! A MUST TRY next time ur in Vegas!!! BTW I brought my kids and didnt get a stink eye from the staff for doing so.

I often wonder if they ever even been to the restaurant. as for me I have been to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant on a few occasions with my significant other. Each occasion costing upwards 400$ and worth every penny. \n\nAside from the romantic setting and views of this restaurant you have perhaps some of the best service every experienced in a restaurant setting. Yes, of course it's pricy but you get what you pay for. From the minute you enter you are catered to, from jacket hanging to chair setting you are the boss at this restaurant. The treatment continues throughout the evening such that if you are on a date or with the one you love you are fully credited for the great experience. \n\nNow, for the food, each course is an experience. From salads that leave you begging for more to prime cuts of steak that melt in your mouth. Desserts are the cu de gra.  For a wonderful and satisfying experience try this restaurant you won't be disappointed. \n\nSuggestions: make reservations in advance, request a window table center and bring a date you are planning a serious relationship with (this is not a McDonalds date environment)."

I was probably most excited to have dinner and here and it ended up being my biggest disappointment. The only reason I can think of that people would recommend here is the view and that's only IF you can get sat along the glass (we had a 4:30 reservation so we were guaranteed that). I will run through the entire experience, I call and make a reservation for dinner for two, at the time of making the reservation I had also made reservations to do the elevator ride to the top after dinner which the girl on the phone told me would be $22, I said ok and book it for 2, she confirmed...when we get to Vegas and head to our reservation I was so excited, we arrive and the hostess was very nice, our table wasn't ready so we went to sit at the bar, we look over the drink selection and it's minimal options and drinks are $20, the bartender never tended to my boyfriend of I and we were sitting there ready to order drinks for 20 minutes. Our table was ready so we left the bar never getting a drink, the bartender wasn't busy, he just wasn't acknowledging us, he was putting glasses away and cleaning his fridge...not off to a good start. We get seated and if you're at all claustrophobic I would not recommend eating here (1 of the many reason I would not recommend it anyway) as I felt I was dining with the table next to me, I could hear their entire conversation and I'm sure they could hear ours. Our waiter was VERY rude, he seemed smug and that was a disappointment. We order 2 drinks from their cocktail menu ($40) and it was pure sugar, so sweet neither of us could finish them. We place our dinner and app orders, I ordered a field green salad which was flavorless, needed more dressing because I felt like I was just eating grass...looked pretty but that's about it. My boyfriend ordered the Caesar and was very disappointed. I ordered the artichoke crepes for my entree and they were flavorless as well, boyfriend got the beef Wellington which he was told would be medium, it came out WELL done and he could barely chew it, it came with pea pods which he said was the best part of the entire meal. The people next to us ordered a filet and beef Wellington and since they were so close, we heard them discussing the same disappointment. Sides are a la carte so we ordered the au gratin potatoes, again, flavorless. We didn't bother with dessert since everything else was so disappointing, besides the bread which was good but I mean...it's bread. Our waiter came over to see if we wanted anything else and we declined, he confirmed we were still on for our elevator ride and we said yes, he tells us he has to call downstairs to see how long the wait is because \"there's usually a line but if we'd like to bypass the line we can pay an additional fee to pass it\" (already seeing the scam not to mention WE MADE A RESERVATION so why are we being told to wait or pay?) I tell him to just let us know what the wait is, he returns and says \"unfortunately there is a 45 minute wait and due to it being a holiday they upped the cost of the ride (we pre booked for this date and I was told it was $22 each) he says it's now $35 a person plus $5 to pass the line (LOL) I literally laughed and said we'd pass. We paid our $250 bill (including tip) and left. I would NEVER EVER go here again or recommend it to anyone, leaving this review is the best advice I can give someone, save your money, do some research, and go on the high roller for a view (do the happy hour cart so you can drink the whole time). I cannot express our disappointment enough in the experience we had here, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

He forgot to bring a jacket and apparently this restaurant likes to keep that \"high class\" feel going. They even lent him a jacket to wear for the entire dinner. I find that somewhat funny but at least they didn't turn him away right?\n\nLooking at the menu, it took me back when I was at the Space Needle for dinner. Everything sounded so amazing yet so pricey! I can admit it, I can be fairly cheap sometimes BUT I do however think amazing foods come at a fair price.\n\nWith that said.. I order the roasted rabbit, no appetizer or salad. They served us asparagus soup  and bread to begin with so I didn't want to stuff my face too much. Gotta save room for dessert! Having rabbit is new to me and as much as I wanted lamb I also like to try new things even more so. The meat was so delicate, much more so than lamb but just as delicious. With the sauce and vegetables served along the rabbit, everything fell into place. My mouth certainly was having a taste bud orgasm.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the pistachio souffle which our server had informed us about in the beginning since it takes about 45 minutes to prepare. Souffle? Yum. Pistachio? YES PLEASE! So how was it you ask? Blissful. I was literally in heaven. Subtle sweet gooeyness and fluffiness... Oh, and it was humongous! I probably could have devoured it all by myself but I was nice enough to share since there was definitely more than enough.\n\nExceptional service of course. Our server was very friendly and informative. The ambiance is very intimate with an outstanding view of the water fountains at The Bellagio. It was a nice experience and worth it but man was I happy to take off my heels after wards! The strip is not friendly to feet in heels at all."

My now hubby got the steak sandwich (which was also excellent, I wished I would have ordered the same) I got the crab french toast which was where the meal took a turn for the worst. The bread was stuffed with a very heavy mixture of crab and mayonnaise. The bread was very heavy, greasy and in conjunction with the crab mixture it just wasn't at all what I expected or very palate pleasing. \n\nWe ordered dessert which was the apple strudel. It wasn't a BAD dessert but it wasn't what you would expect from a french restaurant with this kind of stellar reputation. Our server was excellent but the experience itself was inconsistent.

Paris is much more centrally located and the buildings you have views of aren't tiny specs in the abyss.  And Paris is just plain classier.  Having to trek to the Stratosphere takes the class out of the experience.  And when you're in $50+ pp you want a little class."

However, throughout the course of the evening, we saw that the table was available. While we waited for an alternate table, the hostess had us awkwardly wait in the front to be moved one table up. My family and I were excited to sit near the fountains. Unfortunately, this request was not honored, despite my sister noting this request when making our reservation, and upon check-in.\n\nWe also had a negative experience with our waitress. She did not make us feel welcome, and was very forceful about ordering items off of the menu. As soon as we sat down, she was pushing us to order souffl\u00e9, without even introducing the specials or asking about beverages. I understand that that souffl\u00e9 takes longer to make, but she asked several times. When we told her \"not at this moment\", she stormed off. When we had questions about the menu, she seemed exasperated and was not very helpful. Throughout the evening, she did not come check up on us. From the angle where I was sitting, I saw her talking with her co-workers while ignoring the guests. The only time when she was quick to service was giving us the bill.

I made no reaction, which my girlfriend liked because the couple next to us that ordered 2 drinks, yeah his eyes almost came out of their sockets...lol. Anyway, we waited almost an hour and the bartender, JR, said we could eat at the bar, which we did. He was very nice and helpful giving us Vegas tips on restaurants and clubs. Also, there was much entertainment between the three bartenders as two of them kept making fun of the \"new guy\". \n\nOnce dinner finally came, it was excellent. I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. Also has the asparagus which was great. In the end the total was $260 for food and wine. I would probably go again if I had a little extra $$ to spend. \n\nJust a tip, it is a little upscale as I said. As we were going in, there were other people who had come back from their hotel because the guys were not allowed in with sandals or any open towed shoes. Ladies of course were allowed. I was wearing Dockers and a collared shirt. Most people were pretty dressed up."

            "review": "ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant knows what their selling point is: the view of the strip. It is absolutely incredible. Perfect view of the Bellagio fountains, Cosmo hotel, and the big Paris balloon. I had the pleasure of viewing the scene during the daytime and during then night...the view totally transforms before your eyes when the sun sets. Took plenty of pictures. \nThe tables are quite close together, they want to pack the place up. NOT good for groups, tables are mostly meant for 2-3 people.\nNoise level wise, it was louder than I expected, lots of glass clanking and I could hear the kitchen and bar.\n\nFOOD: The food was quite delicious. I will say it's not the BEST I have ever tasted but it was still delicious all around. (Pictures posted up in pics).\n\nPre-appetizer: they give you a little avacado mousseline in a shot glass type. Tasty. And I always appreciate complimentary dishes. The bread guy was really funny. He will come around with a giant bread plate and give you 5 choices of bread. \n\nAppetizer: got the scallops with ox tail and the quail. Both quite delicious. Quail was better. Scallops were good but I found it interesting that it was in a dark meat sauce (since I associate scallops with lighter sauces).\n\nEntrees: Got the 7 oz. filet minion and the short ribs. Filet was better probably because the cut of the meat was just better. Though the flavoring was still better than the short ribs. I found the ribs slightly on the dry side. They give you 5 large pieces so definitely worth it. The butter noodles and the veggies that came with it were just OK.\n\nSide dish: the potato croquettes were really just potato shaped like finger-length sticks and fried. It was very meh, pretty bland.\n\nDessert: SOUFFLES. Hands down. Got the chocolate and the pistachio. Pistachio was MUCH MORE delicious. Even the waiter said everyone in the kitchen prefers the Pistachio. GET IT. The chocolate one was not that chocolatey...\n\nOverall the experience was very unique and nice. The view is not to be replicated anywhere else. Food was good, but as you know, very expensive. You really pay for the view and the experience. \n\nOh they'll come take a picture of you and you can buy it for $24. Wasn't worth it for me considering I took plenty of pics on my own. =)"

            "review": "Wow, this restaurant did not live up to my expectations at all. I was really disappointed with the food for the price. \n\nOn the last night of a recent Vegas trip with just ladies, we wanted to go out with a classy bang. Earlier in the year I visited the Ramsey Steakhouse which is also located in the Paris hotel/casino. That was my first pick but since we couldn't get a table there, Eiffel was our backup plan. \n\nWe had a reservation for 4 and arrived about 20 minutes early. They accommodated us right away which was great. The view of the strip is a beautiful backdrop to the restaurant. \n\nOur server was excellent. He was very professional and explained everything in detail. \n\nI ordered the surf and turf ($74). It was a prime cut steak with lobster. I was extremely extremely disappointed with my meal. It was a layered meal which consisted of a block of a bland potato dish, topped with the steak, topped with a lobster cake then topped with 2 tiny pieces of lobster and garnish http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gYF9-Ev_sqV2gqB4dMs6Lw&userid=Q2RsDOhzsCBI-F1oOPe6Lg.  Not at all what I had in mind. I couldn't help but compare this to Gordon Ramsay's. Eiffel Tower restaurant doesn't come close to Ramsay's. \n\nIn lieu of a salad, I opted for the tomato, mozzarella and basil app. ($18) http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ehCfEscdNE6edLBmFV77oA&userid=Q2RsDOhzsCBI-F1oOPe6Lg. That was delish! It is heirloom tomatoes, avocado, with fresh mozzarella cheese dressed with a basil oil. I ate this with assorted bread they give. Speaking of bread, you get it only after you put in your order. There is a man who walks around with a platter of assorted bread table-to-table. Can't they just leave a bread basket, don't want that man to judge me on my bread consumption, ha ha?\n\nThe steak was good but nothing mind blowing. Sides were ok. My friends ordered the halibut and only ate about half since she didn't really like the flavor. \n\nI'm glad I can say I've tried this place but probably wouldn't ever come back nor recommend to others."

Since this was a late lunch, there were plenty of open tables, and I was lucky to be placed next to a window with a great view of  the Bellagio Hotel and the fountains.    \n\nThe Server's Assistant had greeted me with incredible bread and then took a drink order.  Shortly after that the server, Mark, had introduced himself and went over the menu.  The lunch menu was limited, however, gave great options.  I had opted for the the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which included Au Gratin Potatoes and Mixture of Green Beans and Diced Tomatoes.    I was in no rush for my meal was was able to enjoy the Fountain Show at the Bellagio Hotel.  \n\nThe Assistant brought the meal within ten minutes, again, I'm on vacation and I'm in no rush.  The chicken was so delicious with the Parmesan crust and the lemon wine sauce.  The green beans were crisp while the diced tomatoes were so sweet.  I wish the potatoes were little crispier, but I'm not going to complain.  \nBoth Mark and the assistant would check in with me without being overbearing.\n\nThe decor is definitely more upper scale but relaxing enough for a late lunch. Mark had presented me with dessert options..... so I ordered the Apple Streudel. \nJust like the main course, the dessert was just as good!\n\nThe restaurant has an open kitchen  - which is spotless!!  For a topnotch dinner, check this restaurant out!"

We overlooked the strip and had an amazing view of the Bellagio water show. The food was the best we've ever had! The best steak and lobster EVER! The Sommelier, Joe was great and helped us select the BEST champagne we have had...and we've been to Champagne, France! I highly recommend dinner here for any occasion!

First, call ahead and reserve a table at the windows with a fountain view.  It's the best view on the strip and a perfect place for a romantic dinner.  This is a must.\n\nChoosing a entree was difficult.  They have an excellent Chef, and their menu is fantastic, but at the end of it, I had been craving a steak all day, and ordered the filet.  It was the best steak I ever had!  And I eat a lot of red meat.  For desert?  Creme brulee; a perfect way to end the meal.\n\nI'll be back!"

Our bill was $210 w/ tax and tip (18%) and we ordered the following:\n\n1st Course\nRoasted Foi Gras Appetizer (A++++++++) \nAbsolutely Marvelous, Pure Heaven!\nServed on a bed of marinated grapes and julienne crepes the Foi Gras completely melted in our mouths and the three tastes blended together exquisitely.\n\nEntrees\nRoasted Quail w/ Tarragon Jus & White & Red Cabbage (A++) \nRack of Lamb w/ Tarragon Jus, White Bean Stew & Grilled Sweet Onion (A++++++++++) \nCreamed Spinach & Mushroom Side Dish (A++)\n\nWe decided to order two entrees, one moderately priced and one high end, in order to stay with our budget.  We shared each of them so we could sample all of the flavors.  \n\nThe Quail was very good, it was our first time trying it and we would definitely order it again.  Not gamey at all and the meat was so savory.  The only downfall with the Quail is there is not much meat because it is a smaller bird, but great nonetheless.  The cold cabbage side was so good and complemented the bird perfectly.  \n\nNow for the Rack of Lamb.  As you may have seen in most of these reviews, everyone loves the lamb.  We will take it one step furthur, we absolutely LUST for this lamb.  WOW quite possibly one of the best lamb dishes I have ever had, mouth watering and succulent, it is a must order on their menu.  The sides again complemented the meat perfectly.\n\nThe creamed spinach side was a great complement to the meal and was not overly creamy.  It was perfectly baked and crusty on top, definitely the best creamed spinach dish I have ever had.\n\nDesert\nChocolate Souffle (A++++)\nThis unbelievable desert was light, fluffy and oh so chocolatey.  It was the perfect ending to our meal.  Oh and did I mention it is prepared from scatch while you eat, takes about a half hour.\n\nDrinks\nTwo Glasses of the house Pinot Noir which was very good for their house wine and the wife had a specialty cocktail called \"Autumn in Paris\" which was fresh crushed pears with vodka and some other fresh things mixed in, in her words, \"It was to die for!\"\n\nThey give you your choice of complementary breads and some finger food desert chocolates and pastries....do yourself a favor and try their french baguettes w/ their house butter and the chocolates filled with caramel syrup, unreal!\n\nAll in all we will be coming here everytime we are in Vegas.  The service is way above par and attentive to your every need and the views are stunning.  Whether its the Paris Balloon or the Belagio Fountains you will be in heaven once the ambiance and food mingle together to tickle your senses. Just make sure you give yourself at least two hours for this dining experience.\n\nHappy Eating!"

The views were good and the atmosphere was nice.  The food was good but not 5 star or what I was hoping for based on the high prices but that doesn't surprise me when you are paying for the experience and the view.  We come from the San Francisco Bay area where we are used to many excellent restaurants so my standard are probably a little high.  We had a bottle of French wine that was good, scallops cooked perfectly but didn't wow us.  A Caeser salad that was good.  Salmon entre was good but it could have been cooked a little less.  Filet mignon was cooked perfectly and was good but again for the $80 price I was hoping to be amazed by it.  Sides of creamed spinach very tasty as well at the grotten potatoes.  Again it was all good and we enjoyed this for a one time experience but would not do it again.  Mon Abi Gabi below also with a terrific view of the Bellagio water show serves similar quality food for more reasonable prices.  I think this place is perfect to have a drink and an appetizer and enjoy the view but not for  a whole meal unless money is no object."

Reserve a table ahead ALWAYS and ask for a table by the window with a view of the Bellagio Water Fountain.\n3. Try the Bananna Souffle, the maitre d will ask if you want it right up front while seating you since that takes time to prepare."

We had the Pimm's Cup, Red Velvet, and Sparkling Passion. All of them were extremely good and perfectly mixed. We ordered the warm foie gras to start. It's so tiny the four slices of pear that accompany it was a bigger portion. But it was smooth and melt in your mouth. Definitely not worth the price. Next to come out was the veal medallions. This is a must get; it was delicious. We had it come out with the appetizers.\n\nNow for the entrees:\nThey ran out of black cod, by the time we got there, so we got the sea bass. It was good, a might order again.\nThe cured duck breast was not that great. I like fatty Chinese roasted duck much better, a definite will not order again.\nRack of lamb was perfect; cooked to perfection and tasted so tender, will order again.\nWe had two New York steaks, both ordered medium rare, but one came out a little drier. It is also a will order again. I regret not ordering a surf and turf instead of the second NY steak.\n\nTo finish off, we had ordered two souffles when told they need to be ordered in advanced. Not sure if we ate too quickly, but we waited a good fifteen minutes between the entrees and dessert. But then they came, one chocolate souffle, and the other waiter-recommended grand marnier souffle. Both were great, but definitely the grand marnier souffle was the best, will come just for this!\n\nIn all, the food was great. Not sure I would come back because it didn't seem like the food was worth the price. Next time, I'll just stick at the bar for the view."

However, I did not like how most of that nights service was. I went with my best friend and our mothers. We are underage and are not legally to drink but allowed but our mothers wanted to order us a drink to have with our dinner. Our mothers told the waiter that they wished to do so and he did not allow it because it would cost him his job. TOTALLY UNDERSTAND! BUTTTT after he left our table he informed the whole restaurant crew and security and they watched us like HAWKS while we had our dinner. Very unprofessional and low-class for such a great restaurant. Props to the chef! but bad service."

My boyfriend and I were as nice as possible to him despite the negative vibe we were getting.  By the end of our meal, I think he felt guilty and his mood changed drastically.  \n\nIt was just the 2 of us so our view was right in front of the Bellagio fountain show.  We got to watch at least 4 water shows.  I absolutely loved it!!  Our meals were mediocre - nothing to rave about although it was good but hands down to the souffle!!  We had the chocolate one and my goodness... we certainly devoured it.  \n\nDefinitely recommended...

You'd expect the kitchen to be in the back, but here it was the first main attraction. Very clean and \"white\" themed. It was definitely the cleanest looking kitchen I've ever seen! The d\u00e9cor is simple and not overly done as it is made to make you feel like you are in the Eiffel Tower overlooking the view. Nothing fancy on the walls since it is fine dining. The booths are very comfortable and seat a part of 4 just perfect. You get the view of the water fountains of Bellagio every 15-20 mins or so. Although I would have loved to see the setting sun from there. The service was a bit off. Our water seemed like he didn't like out of towners (the again, who does?). He was very short with us and had a sarcastic tone. That's fine, but we were expecting a 4 star restaurant service. The meal itself was so-so. I expected it to be perfect as we were supposed to feel like we were in France, but the choices weren't that creative. Probably the best part of the dinner was the Raspberry Souffl\u00e9 with vanilla sauce. Mmmm. It was a good one time experience. The ambiance screamed out of towners, not really romantic."

As soon as we arrived they walked us over to the most perfect seat in the house, right in front of the fountains. We were able to see the fountains go off a total of three times while we were there. We had the waiter check in on us about every 10 minutes, and they were constantly refilling our water. I got the \"king\" filet mignon and the meat just melted in my mouth. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked just right (medium-well). I made sure to savor every bite. The mashed potatoes were also to die for. I got both the wheat and the French bread but the wheat was easier to chew. We ordered the caramel souffl\u00e9 right when we ordered the appetizer and as soon as we were done with our dinner, they brought it fresh from the oven. It felt like we were tasting a little piece of heaven. It was so warm and soft, it was just amazing. Overall, my boyfriend and I had a very romantic dinner with such a beautiful view. The bill came out to about $200 with an appetizer, a glass of wine, dinner for two and a dessert. We're not ones to eat fancy dinners very often, but if you ask me, it was totally worth it."

He was incredibly accommodating and did not raise an eyebrow when I told him absolutely no mushrooms. What I was served with wasn't out of this world (perfectly cooked asparagus, red sauce, and something else that was obviously not that memorable because I can't recall what it was).\n\nHowever, the server made up for it by offering to bring me fresh berries when everyone else was enjoying their souffles.\n\n*I need to be fair-this place did offer a savory vegetarian crepe that my dad ordered and he said it was outstanding. This is not saying much from a man who ranks his top restaurants as different hospital cafeterias but it did look damn yummy."

The day we visited was my birthday, which we informed the hostess of when we made reservations the day before. The entire staff, throughout the reservation process the day before through the meal the following morning, was very courteous. \n\nWe were seated in a rounded booth that faced the Bellagio, which was ideal for me as I find the building to be beautiful and of course there are the fountains. From our seats, it was easier to see the fountains when they were shooting higher - the views from the small tables that line the windows look to be amazing. I was a little disappointed that halfway through the meal, shades were drawn halfway over the windows and thus limited our view.\n\nWe had anticipated the prix fixe menu ($39/pp), before realizing there was also regular menu options. I opted for the french toast, which was listed in the menu as having a vanilla cream, bananas, and pecans. Upon its arrival, there was bacon (actually, pancetta as I was informed) resting on it. I informed our server that I am a vegetarian, and had my only unpleasant moment during this experience -- while he took the dish back to have it corrected, I was not given an apology of any kind but merely told \"that's the pancetta\". This item was not listed in the description on the menu, so I did not know when ordering to request that it not be included.\n\nThe food itself was good, after being corrected. I also opted to have the warm apple dessert, which we were told needed to be ordered in advance due to preparation time. This came out a little more crisp than I would have normally preferred, but overall it was a good dessert. In addition to this, I was given a small chocolate dessert for my birthday. As a chocolate lover, I found this to be very good and especially enjoyed the chocolate slice that topped it.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this restaurant and would return on a future trip so long as the menu still contains items I find appetizing. I would be more careful when ordering to ensure that the option does not contain any kind of meat, however. \n\nAs a final thought, they sell a few items including cookbooks and chocolate bars. As I raved about the chocolate slice on my dessert, my brother purchased a chocolate bar for me. I wish I could say that this was the same chocolate, but will admit that the purchased bar is very good as well -- it is a dark chocolate bar with sea salt. As someone who doesn't care much for salt, I find the combination in this bar to pair very well."

The lady greeter on the day said it was a good thing we were late because now we could stretch out our lunch and sit a while if we wanted and see the water show at the Bellagio across the street. We stayed and took her advise and it was so worth it. The place was technically closed but they still refolded my napkin when I got up and they took our pictures for us. All this and we were 30 min late for our opentable reservation. We had front row seats to the water show at the Bellagio without standing outside in the cold. The kitchen is amazing to look at.

But of course, those breathtaking feature do make an appearance on your bill listed next to your food items. \n\nService:\n\nThis is where the very annoying, yet true saying applies, \"You get what you pay for.\" There were at least 3 servers waiting on our table of 12, which felt really nice. The servers were very pleasant and willing to do whatever it takes to satisfy our visit. I was really appreciative of each and everyone of them. \n\nBread was served to each person individually while you choose you dinner items and enjoy your cocktails. I was surprised at how long it took before our server took our order, but once we placed our orders, the wine arrived and 15 minutes later all the appetizers, then 20+ minutes later the first course, 30+ minutes later the main course, and 1 hour+ after the desert. It was relatively nice to have that cushion to digest and tipsy chat.  I was definitely not use to the time and the leisure of having the time cushion, but considering the view, it was well worth it!\n\nFood:\n\nQuality wise, everything was amazingly fresh. From the oysters, clams, lobsters, shrimp and quality cut meats, it was well worth the $$$$. Our party ordered about 5 appetizers, all of which tasted good.\n\n I ordered the surf and turf entree which is a new york aged steak with a crab cake. I was surprised at how simple it tasted. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it just wasn't fantastic or outstanding. If I were to grade it, the food tasted B average while the quality was an outstanding A.\n\nAfter sobering up, I would really wished the chef  got creative with flavors and tastes. Using crazy herbs and spices to blend the perfect $$$$ taste, which is what we paid. Over 1800. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is still remarkable experience I recommend."

While everybody raves about their views, I think they are seriously underrated for their food. Every single dish that we ordered was amazing. Our waiter was ridiculously attentive without being in your face. The entire restaurant gets gorgeous fountain views at the perfect height. If you make a reservation for 2, they tend to seat you at the window at these cute couple tables where you both sit face next to each other and enjoy the strip view. \n\nWe ordered about 6/7 dishes, including a lobster corn chowder with crab flan (huge chunks of juicy lobster scattered throughout a creamy corn chowder, embellished with a chunk of crab flan), foie gras and warm pear appetizer, the beef wellington (huge portions and unlike anything I've had before, good flavor), an amazing veal entree, and 1 dessert + 1 complimentary dessert for his birthday. Everything was stellar... I didn't have EXTREMELY high expectations so me and my taste buds were ever so thrilled all night. Best part was, our two-person birthday dinner with drinks came to $270 total including tax and a generous tip. Very reasonable in my opinion... Keep in mind we ordered enough food for 3-4 normal people. :) \n\nA special night! \n\nIt would be really hard for one to have a bad night here.

During a trip to Vegas, we decided to enjoy a nice dinner out at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant and actually planned ahead so we made a reservation before we got into town. We called the restaurant, requested a nice window seat and told them it was my birthday. Knowing this is a very expensive restaurant, we expected to have the same experience we've had at other expensive restaurants (in Vegas among other cities). We expected to be greeted nicely and for our reservation to be treated with some dignity. When we showed up for our restaurant, we immediately realized that this restaurant is more of a spectacle than the other fine dining options in the area. They let anyone up into the restaurant so it's very congested by the bar, loud and anything but \"special.\" We gave our name for our reservation and the hostess lead us to our table. As I mentioned, we had made our reservations several weeks in advance and asked for a window table. \n\nThey gave us a \"window\" table but that ended up being right next to a huge poll on the opposite side of the restaurant that didn't overlook the Bellagio fountains but instead the run down Bally's pool that was under construction. It was also the smallest table in the entire restaurant. Our lovely romantic dinner on my birthday was turning into a disaster very fast. We decided to ask the hostess if there was any other table available and they said possibly. So we went to the bar to have a drink and waited for another table. About 20 minutes later they took us to another table. This time, it did have a view of the fountain but it was also right in front of the server's station so we constantly had servers on our laps during the meal. After the cluster of getting a table, I barely remember the food and while we still had a good time because we were together, we won't be visiting the Eiffel Tower Restaurant again for a fine dining experience in Vegas. There are so many other places with just as good of a view, better ambiance and much, much better service!"

I almost fell of the chair. Utterly ridiculous! Moving to our scenic table, we found the service to be lacking. We weren't greeted by waiter, busboy, anyone for several minutes. Ordering the escargot got us what seemed to be one escargot cut in half swimming  around in a filo dough, saucy conglomeration. However the manager did apologize and remove it from the tab. The rest of the meal was nothing we couldn't get anywhere else for a lot less. In fact every other restaurant I passed wherever I went made me mad that I didn't go to it instead. For half the price!  We paid $320.00 for 2 drinks, 3 wines, 2 entrees, green beans and dessert. That was 4 days ago and I'm still not over it!

Food & service was measly. For one, the menu is not very French. French toast was on the menu. That turned me off. Really? French toast is NOT French. And the drinks? My friend paid $18 for a supposed drink that was the hot seller. It was a strange fizzy pink liquid with raspberries floating in it. Did not taste good. Gross.\n\nOur server was very quick to leave us. Don't get me wrong, he definitely had a host's personality when he spoke with us... for like 5 seconds! He would dart in and out, just before we finally would form a question in our minds about the food on the menu.\n\nI had the Aged Parmesan Chicken with what looked like canned vegetables & a miserable pile of dry-tasting potatoes gratin. Blah. The only reason the chicken was tasty was because there was AGED parmesan. And it looked like a giant flat pancake on my plate. I paid $24 for something I could make myself.\n\nI hear there's an Eiffel Tower Las Vegas tour. Go on that instead so you can at least check out the view. The food is not worth it."

The lady serving us seemed like she didn't even want to be there and was extremely rude when one of my friends asked about an item on the menu. The bread was served cold. For a little starter they served us cauliflower mousse. I can't even begin to explain how rancid this smelled. It tasted even worse. It tasted extremely metallic and as one of my friends described, it tasted \"like an old sweat sock\". I decided to order the chicken with vegetables and a parsnip pur\u00e9e and the green beans as an \"accompaniment\" (really pretentious way of saying a side). When the food came it was severely undercooked. Even though the plating was nice, the chicken was bright pink. The green beans were okay but had a really sour after taste. After we all finished eating and the $500 bill was paid off (we didn't order any drinks if you're wondering) we went back to our hotel. I started feeling really bad after eating here and so did two other people I went with. One of them starting throwing up and the other one got the runs while I was in bed with a bad stomachache. We ended up staying in the rest of the night, ordering Chinese delivery to the hotel room, and swearing off this place forever!"

This is no big deal, and can be easily swapped out for water.  \n\nHowever, our waiter took it upon himself to have someone from the kitchen melt milk chocolate and stir it into a glass of milk.  It was the first time, I have seen someone go to such lengths to appease a four year old.  So for this act of excellent service, this place has moved from three to four stars.\n\nThe food was good.  My wife got beef wellington, sorry but it didn't hold a candle to Gordon Ramsay's.  I got a well seasoned, nicely accomplanied piece of fish and my daughter took down an indulgent glass of freahly made chocolate delight to accompany her pasta.\n\nThe view from this place in spectacular but we weren't seated anywhere near a window, and felt it would be rude to go trapsing through someone else's meal to get a nice look out the window.  The view is apparently so nice, that they have employed a theme park style photographer to snap your pic and send you home with a $30 keepsake.  The fact that the place is accessed through an elevator was just incovenient, the fact that it opened up into a fast paced kitchen was offputting.\n\nIf you happen to be at the Paris you have three choices for food in my opinion and in order they are:\n\nRamsay\nMon Ami\nEiffel"

We were seated at a half-moon table overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The service was top notch. I enjoyed my salmon a lot. My girlfriend liked her steak although it wasn't her absolute favorite. The green beans were average. What blew me away was the desert. Because it was my birthday they brought me complimentary mouse, which was delicious. We had also ordered a white chocolate banana elysee, which came out to be a work of culinary art. Amazing thin circles of white chocolate layered with fresh bananas and a torched sugar arc.

It was truly divine. The view. The Bellagio fountains. The ambiance. The drinks. The wine. The chocolate souffl\u00e9 with cascading chocolate. The cauliflower puree to cleanse the palette. The complimentary birthday chocolate mousse for my boyfriend on his special day :) The over-the-top service on all levels. The silver platter to carry our wine glasses to our dining table. The romance. The etiquette. The savory flavors melting on your tongue. This is culinary heaven folks!\n\nFrom the dramatic entrance by way of the elevator, stepping out to a hostess waiting to greet you, seeing the immaculate, sparkling kitchen, to the adjustment your eye makes from the bright kitchen to the romantic dimly-lit sunken dining room with the sensational view, it was wonderful from start to finish. Not to mention THE FOOD! It was all fabulous. Utterly fabulous. While expensive (we rarely eat at these prices and totally splurged this time), it was worth every penny and I would have even paid more! We left a huge tip.\n\nWhat a pleasure to dine here. We loved it so much.\n\nAs a same-sex couple, it was 100% welcoming and full of love for us. Unlike other establishments where we have felt judged or awkwardness in general, they were warm and welcoming, treating us with the respect we deserve (just like any other couple or family is want to expect).\n\nI recommend the Eiffel Tower Restaurant extremely extremely highly. It was sensational.\n\nA trip to Vegas isn't complete without a dinner here. Go, enjoy, and revel in its magnificence!"

We had a reservation but still were asked to sit by the bar or just linger around for a little bit since our table was not ready. It's worth waiting though. \n\nService is great. They are really on top of their jobs. Because we were going to order a bottle of wine, they brought us a specialist to tell which which wines would pair well with their dishes. Our pick was a favorite of both of us - Chateau Montelena. I ordered Muscovy Duck Breast. It was cooked to perfection. The chef was very nice and brought us a complimentary small dessert so that they could wish me happy birthday until I would get my souffle. \n\nThe restaurant has an amazing view over the Bellagio where they do the water show every 15 minutes. It looks amazing from the top of the tower - more so when you have a seat near the window. So worth going here."

We were served housebread and a cup of eggplant mix which was very good. The food arrived and I cut my first piece of steak.......OMG I though! Sorry Mastros, this place tops your steak and it didi not need any sauce to do it. It was cooked to perfection and the taste was amazing.

Sadly they seem to have lost their way. The service was so bad it actually set a negative tone for the rest of the evening! It seems to me that the restaurant's number one goal is to maximize the cost of the meal, rather than provide a positive experience for the guest. They require each guest to purchase an entree (no sharing, no ordering salads or appetizers only). \n\nAfter getting the manager's approval to share a 9 oz. steak that cost $69 a la carte, our server's attitude turned cold. The timing of the food was terrible. I had taken about two bites from my appetizer when my steak was placed in front of me. My friend, who ordered two appetizers instead of one entree, received both at once. His scallops were cold. (I see that other reviewers mention undercooked scallops, so this is not an isolated or new issue.) Another friend ordered the \"warm lobster\" dish, and it was also cold! We had informed our server that one guest would be arriving late, and she brought his salmon out and delivered it to an empty seat to sit and get cold. Our side dish never came out, and the server said she didn't know we ordered it. We ordered the souffle at the beginning of the meal since we were told that it took a while to prepare, and waited at least 30 minutes after all of the plates were cleared for it to come out. With all of these issues, it was the server's cold demeanor that made us the most uncomfortable.\n\nIt is such a shame that the management is allowing the service to slide here, and are ruining what was once a truly wonderful experience. I hope they take reviews like this into account, and make adjustments to their poor attitudes about service!"

So we order drinks and we waited for dinner to be served. It was very hard to get his attention because he was so rude to begin with. So the food came out and looked great I started to eat and started getting hot flashes so my wife starts to move the chicken and there's tons of onions so I had to stop eating  and asked  the waiter why didn't he mention there was onions and he was just rude about it and said well I didn't have to mention that because I should know there's onions in all french food even after I had told him we had never ate at a french restaurant. But besides the mishap and the rude waiter the view was beautiful and my wife enjoyed her food and that's all that mattered..\n\n The funny thing is that besides the mishap my believes if you don't leave good tips you get bad luck at restaurants so we tipped him $60 and LoL when we were leaving we saw him looking how much we left him and I was going to the bathroom to put water on my face and when I came out he was talking to my wife saying how much he was concerned with my health and much he enjoyed us. I was like really?? ?? Just because we tipped you??? I'm glad I wasn't there when he said that ...\n\nSo \"Jorge\" the waiter profile someone that comes to your restaurant because don't think we didn't see the two ladies next us that you were kissing the butt the whole night and they ran up a $400 tab and left you $5 bucks. We seen what they left you..\n\nBut if you want a beautiful view eating dinner with your spouse or that special somebody then go here and enjoy. If you get Jorge tell him we said hi lol"

It certainly looked good!\nBoneless Organic Rabbit - super tender pieces of breast, the rabbit sausage was a bit salty but sausage generally is, still easy to eat though.\nRack of Lamb - a refined combination of flavors and juicy tender lamb.\nWe accompanied these dishes with the Potato Gratin and Creamed Spinach and Mushroom which were great sides to our main meals.\nWe felt too full to do dessert, but somehow a tray of sorbets made it to our table, and it was certainly refreshing!\nOne of my friends had an after dinner liqueur I can't remember which, but it completed his meal.\nI hope my friends took good care of our servers, cuz I didn't get a chance to look at the bill.

Our waiter greeted us very friendly, gave us wine list first, expensive bottles of wine, red, white, sparkling, I didn't see one bottle less than $70, we ordered bottle of champagne around $100, it was so good! We took time to look through the menu while sipping on our champagne. \n\nTheir complimentary bread was a big tray, server carry it around for dining people to choose what kind of bread we want, they gave us a creamy soup as dipping sauce,  butter too. I didn't like the cold bread and soup, but it was a great dipping sauce, bread tasted so delicious with it.\n\nOur amazing food:\nTrio of American Caviar, Golden Whitefish, American Sturgeon, Salmon Roe, 28 grams each, with Creme Fraiche, Chives, Blinis and Toast: they were heavenly delicious! Beautiful presentation! We enjoyed every single bit of it very much\n\nCream of mushrooms soup, wild rice galette, crispy shallots: so delicious, soup was very flavorful\n\nMaine lobster salad, roasted butter squash, wilted kale, old cider vinaigrette: the kale was so yummy! The lobster was very tender and flavorful, loved loved it! \n\nFricasse of escargot, sweetbreads, fennel, farm raised poached egg, Pinot noir jus: the escargot was so tender, but not very flavorful, the poached egg was perfect, I still loved it cause I wanted something light as entree for that night. \n\nChar broiled filet Mignon, red wine sauce: hubby asked for extra red wine sauce, he said the filet was one of the best he has ever had for a very very long time! He absolutely loved the red wine sauce!\n\nGratinee creamed spinach and mushroom: too creamy to our liking, but still yummy\n\nWe didn't order desert, the portions were really big for French cuisine! But the restaurant gave us chocolate mousse for our anniversary! They even put chocolate \"happy anniversary\" on the plate.... Aww... It was just too sweet and beautiful! \n\nI was so happy for our memorable anniversary dinner, with beautiful views from our seat, over the top service, tasty champagne, delicious food, what more could I ask?.... It was just amazing! $350 dinner was very well worth it....\n\nA perfect restaurant for romantic dinner date or special occasions!"

We got to sit right in front of the windows with an excellent view of the Bellagio water shows.  \n\nThe food was excellent.  My fiance ordered their romaine salad and their NY steak... I had their escargot and salmon.  Everything was soooooo good.  And best of all: their chocolate souffle.  OMG.  So freaking wonderful.  Their cocktails: orgasmic.  I loved it!\n\nBest of all, we got to meet Mike Tyson who happened to be eating there as well.  No worries guys, I left with both of my ears in tact ;)"

But reviews for the Eiffel Tower restaurant were positive so I decided to give it a chance. I had an early reservation in order to see a Cirque show so was seated right at the window facing the strip. Great view, although in order to maximize the number of tables by the window there isn't much space between tables. Expect to be listening to the conversation at the next table, and vice versa.\n\nService was attentive and food was faithful to true French cooking. Monkfish was excellently cooked, although the portion was small. The chef did serve an amuse bouche of a pistachio soup. Souffle for dessert was good, but not great. Petit fours are served with the check. A loud group at the bar marred the romantic feel of the dinner somewhat. Overall a cool experience but don't expect to feel like you're in France."

            "review": "Amazing!  So, I think that in a classy place like this, one should not take pictures of ones food.  Therefore, the below pictures are only of the view.\nThe Eiffel Tower has been on my Las Vegas bucket list for a while.  In November, I decided to tell hubby exactly what I wanted for both my birthday and anniversary so that I could have exactly what I wanted.  I told him to make this restaurant happen for our anniversary.  \n\nWe arrived at our appointed time.  However, it was about a 10 minute wait.  I think that was due to our request to have a window seat.  I had already talked myself into thinking that it won't matter.  There are no bad seats in the place.  However, shortly thereafter, we were walked to our table at the window.  We were facing more towards the Cosmo, then dead on to the fountains.  Still, the view was joyous.\n\nMoving on to the food.  Whoohoo!  \n\nI started off with butternut squash soup.  It was a production.  They brought me a soup dish with only solid items on the bottom.  Then, woosh, a pitcher of soup was poured on top of it.  If I were less classy, I would have licked the bowl.  As it was, I was fighting to keep myself from wiping it with the freshmade french bread that had been brought shortly before receiving the soup. \n\nMoving on the my main course, I have the rack of lamb.  A bite of the crust will make you cry a little.  It was so delicious.  As I got more full from the creamed spinach side and the potato al graten, I knew I could not finish my lamb.  I offered it to the hubby who was willing to sacrifice for me to not take home a doggie bag.    However, before I gave it to him, I ate off the crust on all sides....He was sad, but still took it.\n\nWhile we had declined the souffle, however, our super stealthy waiter snuck a dessert menu on our table.  Well, he went to all the trouble, but I was super full, so I guess that I would just have to have a Normandy coffee.  With a yummy cocktail and an alcoholic coffee, I breezed out of the restaurant full and giddy.  \n\nThanks for the amazing night!"

After fighting traffic and waiting in a loooong valet line, we go up to the restaurant and realized it wasalmost 9 o'clock.  Would you believe it?  On one of the busiest nights, they still held our reservations and it only takes them 15 minutes to get our table ready.  After being seated, our waiter serves us our choices on their V-day menu.  Everything tasted great, the second we finished something they took our plate, the restaurant was pretty, the view of the fountain was nice, and my wine glass never was empty until the end.  I already was thinking in my head to give it four stars (only because I thought it was just a bit over priced).  However, I ended up giving them five because of this...\n\nMy waiter came back saying what NO ONE ever wants to hear, \"I'm so sorry, but your card was declined\".\n\nThe room went black and I died (at least that's what I wanted to happen in that moment).  Immediately, I called my bank.  After having the worst experience on the phone with my bank again (review of Chase customer service coming soon, and it won't b,pretty) and not having any way to pay, I expected the worst.  With no questions asked, the waiter and the manager informed me in the kindest manner that they'll just do a copy of the card and my ID and to not worry whatsoever, to come back tomorrow was just fine and don't let this ruin my Valentine's Day.\n\nEiffel Tower, I loved your decor, food presentation as well as taste, the live singer and nice views.  But what I loved most was the superb customer service and understanding.  Thank you for not making me feel like such a cheap skate.  Will you always be my Valentine?"

The bread would have tasted better if it was warmer, but oh well. After our meal, the waiter even brought me a chocolate mousse dessert for my birthday!

But then he mentioned a spectacular view and I remembered the actual Eiffel Tower in Paris has a restaurant in the middle of it. \n\nIt's quite a walk (especially in stilettos!) from the parking lot past the buffet and through the Paris casino to the elevator which will take you up to the restaurant.  \n\nWe arrived uncharacteristically late (8:30 for our 8:15 reservation). Because we specifically wanted a window seat (which I HIGHLY recommend), we ended up waiting over an hour. Around 9:45, the hostess let us know that 7 tables had signed their checks and they were just waiting for them to leave. \n\nFirst up, the gazpacho amuse bouche was flavorful and refreshing. Oddly, someone walks around with bread (which I suppose is a good thing if you don't want to fill up on it). I preferred the baguette to the multi-grain. We also ordered two glasses of cabernet based on our waiter, Tom's, suggestion. \n\nWe started with a summer salad with shaved vegetables and corn soup. I felt the salad was overdressed and yes, there were literally paper thin slices of vegetables. They brought over my soup bowl and poured the liquid contents into the bowl tableside. Fancy. It was supposed to have manila clams but I couldn't really taste it although I am always happy to be served bacon. \n\nFor entrees, the boyfriend ordered steak and bone marrow while I had the rack of lamb, cooked medium. Both were succulent and perfectly cooked and definitely worth the wait. The staff apologized for the long wait. Since the kitchen was slammed, our entrees didn't come out until nearly 10:30. \n\nWe ended the meal with a Grand Marnier souffle (they have 6 kinds), which you have to order at the beginning of the meal. Afterwards, they brought out petite fours. Yum. \n\nAlthough the soup and salad were forgettable, the entrees were amazing and perfectly cooked. What was most impressive was the view. We were seated by the window where it directly faces the Bellagio water show. Easily the best seat in the house. Saw quite a few brides (2-3) at this super romantic venue. Highly recommended."

But I ate it anyways since the raw beef was over powered by all the spices they put in it, I couldn't really tell if the meat is bad at this point and I don't like wasting food.\nI started having upset stomach after we left the place. I have very strong stomach so if I get sick, that means the food is reallllly not good \n\nAnyways, the bill come out to be $100 before tips. The food quality does not match their price point.

If that is a deal breaker, check the weather forecast. 20 mph winds or greater, no fountains.\nService- great. Our guy was very attentive.\nValue- this is what makes this a 3 star. The prices are way high. I've had ribeye steaks before in tins of places all over the US. I've been to dives and been to 5 stars. $89 ala carte for this cut of beef was too much. The petite filet was $60. Dry aged for 18 days still does not make that price stick.\n\nSo in a nutshell. Good food. Too loud and too expensive"

A great photo opportunity. \n\nWhen we were escorted to our table we were so excited to discover we were by the window over-looking the Bellaggio Fountains! They were truly a sight to behold while sipping on my Sauvignon Blanc!\n\nThe amuse bousche was a cold cauliflower soup and was a nice way to start the dinner, as well as their gorgeous selections of homemade breads.  I ordered the cod done 'en papillote' with trumpet mushrooms and lemon. It is a fabulous presentation but I do have to say the lemon completely over-powered the mushrooms. My mom and husband had the salmon with a Pinot Noir reduction and they both said it was one of the best pieces of salmon they'd ever had. My dad ordered the surf and turf and loved the steak but said the crab was just 'meh'. I had a side of Brussels sprouts that were divine and we all loved the side of asparagus with Gorgonzola.  \n\nMy favorite part of the meal? You guessed it... the Chocolate Souffle'. The souffle' was eggy, rich and decadent. \n\nNotes:  Eiffel Tower is a fun excursion for the hopeless romantics when in Vegas. Watch the wine list, though, it's crazy pricey (I know, I work for a winery and the bottle prices are pretty outrageous). Stay with wine by the glass."

Walking into Paris to the Eiffel tower is relatively easy if you know which way you are walking. Once you find yourself at the elevator entrance to the restaurant, it's a straight shot to the dining room. I think it's cool that their kitchen is the first thing you see when you get off the elevator. \n\nIt was 830p on a Saturday, and the bar was busy. Still lots of people waiting for their tables.  We finally found a couple seats at the bar and ordered what we came for. \nThe souffles: chocolate and banana.

If I come to the bar again, I'll remember to come after 9 so I don't need to stalk for seats at the bar."

            "review": "The Skinny: come here for the view - not for the food (2.5)service: solid but not high end restaurant level (3) value: overpriced for the cuisine but a great view of the Bellagio fountains (2.5 starred review bump up to 3 stars).\n\nWe came for the brunch menu last weekend after receiving our annual coupons from Lettuce Entertain You.\n\nWe went in to try their brunch prix fixe and also to try a few a la carte items.\n\nAfter making an Open Table reservation, we choose the earliest seating at 11 am. Despite arriving at the hostess area at 11 am, we were asked to sit in a small area for a while as they set up our table. They seated us with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nOverall the cuisine sounds very elegant but in reality, it's just subpar French bistro cuisine with better plating. I get to that again in a moment.\n\nWe chose the brunch prix fixe menu - the mushroom strudel appetizer, the steak and eggs, and the \"frozen\" strawberry souffle for $39. We chose the foie gras tourchon appy and the curry chicken pie entree as well.\n\nWe were treated to two slice of baguette with some butter to start. The bread was warm but other than that, nothing special. Really, it's the same thing that likely gets served at Mon Ami Gabi. This is in stark contrast to when they used to serve warm cheese gourgeres.\n\nAmuse was a zucchini parfait. The zucchini parfait itself was good however it unfortunately was served with these odd pastry sticks which were hard yet not crispy, chewy and flavorless. It really detracted from the zucchini parfait itself. A bad plating decision that pops up again and again throughout the meal.\n\nThe mushroom strudel was kind of strange. Made of filo pastry, it's mostly made out of spinach rather than mushrooms. The spinach was surprisingly bland and you couldn't really taste the mushrooms due to the lack there of.  At least the parmesean cheese sprinkled above and below the filo pastry crust imparted a bit of umami to the dish but otherwise I can't recommend ordering this dish.\n\nThe foie gras tourchon was a disappointment - it wasn't nearly as luscious as I expected. Served with some brioche toast, the fig compote had a odd kind of fermented flavor to it as well as being too thick to be spread easily. Decidedly meh and I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nFrom the starters to the entrees, there was a good 30 minute wait between. Luckily the view was nice so we didn't mind as much but there is obvious a timing issues in the kitchen.\n\nSteak and eggs were ordered medium rare and came out medium-well. I'm not one to send stuff back usually. Plus given the long wait between the dishes, I just went with the flow. The quality of the steak was good and the meat was tender. The potatoes and red pepper hash underneath was delicious. Unfortunately the blanched spinach was unseasoned and therefore completely bland which diluted the flavors of the dish. It was okay, but once was enough.\n\nChicken curry pot pie was essentially a version of chicken tikka masala baked under a puff pastry crust. The filling was underwhelming and slightly overly acidic. It really needed something to mellow the flavor out a bit. It was also missing a bit of that smokiness from real chicken tikka. It definitely need some dried fenugreek leaves to give it a more authentic flavor. I don't think I would recommend ordering this.\n\nWe split their \"frozen\" strawberry souffle. I kind of had a beef with that. Call a spade a spade - it's just ice cream molded into a ramekin to look like souffle. Word.\n\nAnyway, the ramekin ice cream block with sprinkled pistachio was alright. In my honest opinion, I got more enjoyment from a grocery store purchased ice cream than this stuff.  The strawberry ice cream was overly firm and had a weird Cool Whip consistency when melted slightly. This contrasted to the more icy texture of the Grand Marnier ice cream on the bottom. This was a grade D in the level of desserts. It was okay because it was a part of the prix fixe but I would have been down right pissed if I'd ordered a la carte. Save your pennies and head over to a half decent gelati joint and be way more happy.\n\nAt the end you get some chocolates (tastes like Cadbury chocolates and certainly nothing really special) and some fruit flavored jellies.\n\nService, in general is good. Water glasses were filled through out the meal and food was served promptly and at the proper temperatures. Our waiter was courteous and helpful. However it was missing the small attention to detail that differentiates a truly high end restaurant (such as - describing your dishes in detail, removing the wine glasses as soon as they know you're not going to order wine... stuff like that).\n\nThis joint exemplifies the rule for \"view\" restaurants: the quality of the food is inversely proportional to the view. Added the price premium for the location, I would not recommend this place as a top choice for a romantic dinner for 2. 2.5 starred review with a bump up to a 3 starred review."

If you're looking to woo a date, bring them here.\n\nWe ordered their \"best dish\", which was the lamb chops and it was good. It didn't have that overwhelming lamb taste.  We also ordered the queen filet mignon and the veal medallions. On the side we had asparagus and mashed potatoes (good, but they are an extra cost). \n\nFor dessert we had the pistachio souffl\u00e9.

I'd order that again. Foie gras was what one would expect; melt in your mouth decadence, if you like this sort of thing. This is hard to cook -- as it might melt before your eyes if you try this at home. \n\n4-star dishes: filet mignon was tender, juicy and simply cooked well.\n\nI don't know what to say about the venison. It was served cold-blood rare, and had the iron-y taste of grass fed beef except 10 times more intense, almost pungent and bitter like arugula on steroids. Other reviews of the venison here on were pleasant. Was this a new recipe? Is this a different species of deer? Was it the charred spice coating? The red cabbage on the side made it worse. The saut\u00e9ed apples did not redeem it. I had a few bites and did not touch the rest."

We were gonna dine at one of the most fanciest Places in all of Las Vegas, It was me, My dad, Mike and his wife Martha, Joe and his wife Deb (Joe treated everyone to dinner) and Paul and his wife Linda (a table of 8). Located on the 11th Floor of the Paris, we took the Elevator up and when we walked in we saw the Kitchen Staff hard at work preparing Dinner then we saw this big Extraordinary, Elegant Room and you get a nice view overlooking the Bellagio Fountains outside. \nWe sat down and while making our decisions for Appetizers were treated to a lovely Amuse-Bouche (French for Amusing the Mouth, to wake up your Palate, with a bite-sized appetizer) It was a shot glass filled with Celery Root Mousseline (Mousseline is a creamy soup-like sauce when you fold Whipped cream into Hollandaise) It was topped with some chopped Celery for some Texture (A nice way to start the meal and to wake up the Palate). For my Appetizer I got the New York State Foie Gras which was sitting on a Crispy Alsace Spice Cake with Quince Compote and Petite Mache (Foie Gras, which is what I call meaty butter, melts in your mouth, Quince a tart Fruit, similar to a pear in Appearance but has the Similar taste and texture to an Apple, Spice Cake was a nice crunchy little wafer spiced with cinnamon and Mache a leafy green that has a nutty flavor, it was Awesome). \n\nMy Dad got the Lobster Bisque with Lobster Flan, Celery and a Brioche Crouton (Rich, Smooth Creamy Soup with a Flan in the center made from Lobster Stock, you get some crunch from the Celery, and then you take a bite of that Crispy Brioche Crouton, its Spectacular). Everyone else at the Shared 2 Different Salads, The 1st one was a Tuscan Kale Salad, Door County Dried Cherries, Cherry Tomatoes, Quinoa Croutons, Toasted Pecans and finished with a Balsamic Vinaigrette (So much going on in that Salad, Crisp, Earthy Kale, Sweetness from the Cherries, Tartness from the Cherry Tomatoes, you get Crunch from both the Croutons and Pecans and you get Acidity from the Vinaigrette). The 2nd one was a Non-Traditional Caesar Salad with a Dressing made from Anchovies, Capers and Garlic (I honestly don't know what was Non-Traditional about that Salad and I thought the dressing was a tad bit too Salty for my Taste). \nFor our Drinks, while everyone else was mostly having Red Wine or Chardonnay, Me and Martha partook in one of their Signature Cocktails: The Eiffel Affair (Consisting of Blueberry Vodka, Cr\u00e8me de Cassis, Cointreau, Rose Nectar, some Champagne for that Fizzy and Bubbly Effect and topped off with some Fresh Berries). \nFor our Entrees: I had The Rabbit with Braised Carrots Confit and Mustard Jus (My first time eating Rabbit, so moist and tender like Chicken, Bite from the Carrots and Sweetness from the Mustard Jus, They use Dijon Mustard). My Dad and Paul had the Pan Seared Pork Chop with Spiced Braised Apples and with a Calvados Sauce (Juicy Pork, the Apples go so well with Pork and the Calvados Sauce was sweet Tasting, Calvados is an Apple Brandy), Mike got the Roasted Rack of Lamb with Tomato Tart and Tarragon Jus (The Bones were Beautifully Frenched ), Martha got the Red Snapper with Razor Clams, Fingerling Potatoes, Tomato Confit and finished with a Shellfish Bouillon (The Fish had a nice Crispy Skin), Deb and Linda had the Roasted Chicken with Apricot, Quinoa Pilaf and Moroccan Spices (I love Roasted Chicken, so flavorful). Joe got the Char Broiled Filet Mignon with a Truffle Sauce (his was the most Expensive).\n Then we Ordered Dessert: I got the White Chocolate Banana Elysee (It was named after a Building in France, It was sliced Bananas and White Chocolate Disks stacked on top of each Other surrounded by a Moat of a Chocolate/Vanilla Sauce Mixture and at the top there be a little ball made of Caramelized Sugar, Normally I don't eat bananas but this was so damn Good, it was the most stunning Dessert I've ever eaten, it looked like a spaceship and boy did I take it to my Leader, My Stomach), Mike and Martha got the Chocolate Hazelnut a la Parisienne with Vanilla Ice Cream (It resembled a Bear Claw, Mike and Martha seemed to enjoy, but I thought it was bitter and after 2 Bites I couldn't take anymore), Joe and Deb got the Raspberry Napoleon with a Vanilla Blanc Manger and Red Fruit Sorbet (Stacked Beautifully) and Paul and Linda got the Classic Cr\u00e8me Brulee (A bit of a Clich\u00e9). \n\nEverything was Amazing, but I had to delete the Pictures that I took here due to the Flash on my Camera not working so after calling the Restaurant a couple times (10) Linda (one of the Hostesses) and Sharon (one of the General Managers) were kind enough to help me out and to email me the Pictures. Also more thing my dad says you should adjust the lighting cuz it was very dim to him. I really had a nice time here, I'll be sure to come here again the next time I'm in Vegas !!!"

We were greeted by a french hostess and were escorted up the elevator, and then seated with a breathtaking view of the Strip and Bellagio fountains. They were not running, but still a great view none the less. Our server was also french and beyond kind and helpful. Talk about a true \"Paris\" experience!\n\nThe amuse bouche was a simple cauliflower cold soup (?) and was amazing! The wine menu was impressive and boasted wonderful French wines, or French-inspired. Go figure, in a classy place like this! They nailed it on the head for what they are trying to sell.\n\nWe had the Composition of French Cheeses as our appetizer. My favorite was the bleu cheese drizzled with honey comb. YUM! And this appetizer was perfectly paired with our wine choice. The name of the wine is elusive to me now, but it was a great french wine that I would love to have again.\n\nI had the Ocean Seafood Salad. WOW! Delicious! Everything I ever hoped and dreamed! Words cannot explain the orgasm that happened among my taste buds. An amazing mouth orgy of ecstasy. I have been dreaming about this dish ever since. All of these tasty chunks of seafood nestled among greens, served with lemon (which I loved and squeezed all over everything) and a French Cocktail Sauce which I drizzled on top and seriously order this you will not be disappointed...\n\nMy wonderful other half (whose idea it was to take me here in the first place, well played my dear) ordered the Aged Parmesan Crusted Chicken. It was delightfully sizzling upon presentation and a generous portion. Although it was not the most amazing chicken he has ever tasted, it was very good. I would call this a high class pounded and fried chicken, and I would have to say this would be good on a hunk of bread with some mayo and lettuce. Sorry, just not the best ever.\n\nOur dessert was Creme Brulee. Sadly, I was disappointed in this dessert as it is usually one of my favorites. I liked the same dessert in the downstairs buffet better. I would not order this again but I would try another tasty treat. After dessert we were offered some caramel and fruit things which were delightful.\n\nI would absolutely (and can't wait to) return again. I would like to try for dinner as well. The overall experience was pretty authentic and even though not all of the food was top notch, I think they deserve 5 stars."

We were seated by the windows overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.  This is such a great view.  If this view is offered, don't hesitate, you won't regret it!\nI ordered the escargot for my appetizer (delicious but I have had better elsewhere), and the lamb chops for my entree.  The lamb chops were cooked medium and literally melted in my mouth.  Awesome flavor and very well cooked.  My husband ordered the NY strip steak and he loved his steak also.  For dessert we were presented with a chocolate dessert from the chef with a happy anniversary message written on the plate.  It was a very nice gesture! We also ordered the grand marnier souffle, which was just plain good.  \nOverall:  The restaurant was a bit pricey, but we knew we were going to spend quite a bit of cash when it came to our anniversary dinner.  This was not a problem.  And in my opinion, with the beautiful view, delicious food and impeccable service, we decided it was money well spent."

It seems that half the value of the meal is on the view (in this case, the Bellagio water show), and it's at the expense of the service or the food.\n\nI was delightfully not disappointed on either count by the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  Highlight of the evening was our indulgence in a delightful chocolate souflee (order at the beginning of the meal, 30 minutes to prepare).  The wine list is probably too large for your average tourist to comprehend, but our waiter was patient as a trained dog in helping my godmother choose a wine from the list in the dim light.\n\nTheir bar also knows how to make a fantastic sidecar with bourbon.  Got me hopped enough to play a spin of roulette (Won $10 on black).\n\nService was a bit slow in mid-meal, but I give our server high marks in geniality."

The views are incredible, the wait staff is impeccable, and the food is top notch. I can't really remember what we both had for dinner, though, because the dessert really over-shadows it in both of our minds. The restaurant has a selection of souffles of the day, and the bff, being a nut about nuts, HAD to order the pistachio souffle. (We had a little debate over which flavor to order, as I looooove chocolate, but I was nice and let him win on his bday.) We both died and went to heaven. It was everything you'd ever want in a dessert--decadent, flavorful, wonderfully warm and rich. We both still talk about that souffle more than a year later, and we even tried to recreate it, which didn't come anywhere close to as spectacular. Yes, the prices are steep, even for Las Vegas, but the food, the ambiance, and the wait staff are all worth it. Even if you don't go for dinner, you should grab a glass of bubbly and a fantastic souffle for dessert while enjoying the Bellagio fountains."

Crispy Michigan farmstead Artisanal Camembert with Almond Apricot Petite Salad was our appetizer - would've been better wrapped in puff pastry instead of wonton skin, but it was a great bit of cheese and the accompaniments were sized and paired well.\n\nI had braised short ribs as my main, and my goodness were they rich.  the fat hadn't quite melted down the way you'd want it to, so i found myself eating around it a lot, but the portion was big enough that i felt like i got plenty of meat, despite leaving quite a bit. the chestnut spaetzle was probably fine - i didn't care for the texture, but i think that's more me than how they cooked it.  my friend and co-worker loved her surf and turf - i tried the turf offering and it was definitely among the butterier, tastier tenderloins of my recent memory.  \n\nChocolate souffle was a little much richness on top of everything else, but somehow, we managed to eat it all :) the coffee was also rich and fantastic, and came with those raw sugar lumps that i just want to dump out of the bowl and into my pocket for later.  the bill was not unreasonable for what we had once you take the view and service into account.  very lovely meal."

Both were almost flawless until the main meat course, which sucked my donkey's ass (some chef experiments aren't meant to be charged for). \n\nWe began with an amuse bush of three small items including lobster, sausage, and cured vegies. Our first course was a raw scallop appitizer. This was my favorite course of the evening. After that we had a delicious seared fish followed by the main meat couse which was a tenderloin of venison with a spice rub. The venison was totally overpowered by the rub, which tasted so strong it was almost like powdered pine needles (I am thinking, pepper, star anise, cloves, allspice, and maybe thyme). We packed that in a box to eat later, which I tried to do but gagged every time until I threw it away.\n\nThe desert course was lovely, I recall it being a chocolate mouse which my partner gobbled up as her favorite course of the night.\n\nThe wine pairing flowed nicely and in fact so nicely that I gave my partner my last three glasses, and she got sexily buzzed.\n\nThe best thing about the evening besides the service was the view. We sat sat right at the window in the middle of the fake Eiffel Tower, overlooking the Bellagio wather show, which we got to see multiple times. \n\nIt was a lovely dinner (except for the venision which was like a poop in the punchbowl) and then proceeded to our hotel room for some after-the-culinary-orgy exercise.\n\nA very nice night - at the cost of $450 for two of us."

One of those movie kitchens.... Service is above average and the somelier Jennifer was very nice, she tried to pick a wine that suites our budget and did fine. Wine Is extremely overpriced, so be prepared for that! Remeber to bring a collar shirt, they do have a dress code.\nNow the food, this is where this place stands out period! The steak tartare is above average with hints of dill that made it unique... Well balanced, good texture and elegant. The main course was way above average... Sinply reaching those levels of perfection... The chef did just what needed to be done, cooked to perfection and giving the plate the correct balance even though I would have substituted the \"fried brioche\" under the steak ( that was there for texture and crunchy balance) and done something different..... The meat, well, see the pictures... Tender, flavourfull, thick, juicy and the foie gras on top, well I'm just getting the texture in my mouth again and is making me drule... Don't forget to ask for the souffle ahead of time as it will take time to prepare... Again, try thinking outside of the usual chocolate and do yourself a favor... Grand marnier...

(i've been to other expensive restaurants and the food was mediocre (definitely not cool)\n\nService: was great...had a fairly young waiter but definitely attentive...he even conversated with the boyfriend for a bit and took as many pictures of us as we  liked =)\n\nbreak down of the money\n\nfor half a dozen of roses in a vase (ran about $70)\n\nfood + drinks ($100)\n\ntotal was around $200 ...it was once in a while kind of thing but to this day the boyfriend and i remember this date very well...it was a great experience definitely worth it"

Upon entering the dining room (passing through some of the pristine food prep areas), I was struck by the LOOK of it all - the immaculate tables, all the customers dressed nicely, and of course, the view. Go at night, you'll be entertained by the Bellagio fountains all night. Both times I've been here, I was lucky enough to have been sat at the window and all night it was a treat.\n\nI can't say enough about the food and service here. This is a \"fancy\" restaurant and they don't disappoint. Everything I've tried there was fantastic. I had beef Wellington and it was superb, and they gave a very generous portion, and was made perfectly. One in our party did have an issue with the dish he had (it was cooked too much), but once we mentioned it to our server, the problem and food were fixed immediately. \n\nService is excellent and get top marks.

A person can only say no so many ways. It made us uncomfortable. \n- His steak was far too tough and tasteless. He had to use a lot of lemon butter to even be able to eat it. Ruth's Chris has far better steaks. The Eiffel's steak was comparable to Applebee's. It was also poorly plated and phallic shaped. Don't worry I will post the picture because it's hilarious on so many levels. \n- When the server asked if we were enjoying our food, my boyfriend expressed his dislike for the steak. She offered to get him a new piece, but we didn't have time to wait because we were going to a show right after of which the staff was already aware. At that point a discount, or another solution to remedy the situation should have been offered.\n- As we were leaving we were asked again how everything was and we said it was just ok, but again no one expressed regret. They seemed shocked as if they're so used to tourists being happy enough to just be there that they didn't know what to say or do.\n- The coup de gr\u00e2ce was as we stood and waited for the elevator, a line of male kitchen staff members rudely stared at me in an inappropriate manner. \n\nPros:\n- The view is phenomenal. My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to get a table right by the window as the Bellagio fountains began. This is obviously for what you're paying. \n\nIt should also be noted that while it had nothing to do with our experience, a couple two tables down from us found a HAIR in their food."

As a long-time Vegas traveler, I can assure you the food is just mediocre.  The Beef Wellington came in at $68.00 ala carte, and was barely edible.  Although the color of the meat led me to believe it was the Medium-Rare I'd hoped for, it just didn't have that melt-in-your-mouth tenderness that you expect with a tenderloin.  My other dining companions opted for the chicken, and were also underwhelmed.  The Au Gratin potatoes weren't bad, just blah.  Even the mushrooms lacked that deep flavor that you come to expect from a high end steakhouse.  \n\nThis place is just a tourist trap- the same money is better spent at Gordon Ramsay's Steak house, also located in Paris."

Everything else is just blah.\n\n*Reservations: They use OpenTable, so it is pretty easy to make reservations. About 2 days \nprior to actual dinner, a conformation text is sent, with explicit mention of their dress code. \n\n*Dress Code: Like others have said, what a f***** joke. Yes they did make one gentleman take off his hoodie and barrow a jacket, but other than that it was a crap shoot of what you would find. Yes, many followed it, but it was highly questionable on some  individuals that they let in during dinner service. No way in hell did their attire meet their so called dress code.\n\n*Views- The views were stunning, there is no denying that. Many of the tables lined the windows, and depending upon your seat, you were offered a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains and Paris Balloon.\n\n*Gluten Free Food- They had a separate gluten free menu with a number of different options. They did also offer a tasty gluten free bread prior to dinner. \n\n*Food - For about the amount of money per item, I'm sorry the quality didn't match up. You could go to a handful of restaurants on the strip and save half of what you spent dining here.\n\n*Service - Attentive and friendly\n\n\nFor me this is really a one and done restaurant. If you promised to take someone to dinner in Paris to dine at the Eiffel Tower but didn't say that you weren't taking them to Paris, France,,,by all means, this is your way to say that you lived up to your promise."

Checking in for the reservation was easy as well. Our table was ready immediately. We asked for a window, of course, but the hostess said it is hard to seat parties of 3 by the window. We were given a table large enough for 4 people as close to the window as we could hope and it turned out great! Watch out for the beams of the structure everywhere! Small restaurant...and actually hard to navigate through. I can see why it is hard to seat a party of 3 or more by the window...all the window seats are for two people. Lots of couples! \n\nIF you are trying to dine here on a budget you have to navigate the menu very carefully. We were not on a budget and the three of us got out of there for $500, before tip. It can add up quickly. \n\nWe started with cocktails. I had two of their classic cocktails which were both delicious. We had two appetizers to start. 1st, cold Foie Gras. We liked it a lot. The texture was spot on. My small tiny complaint: too much Nutmeg? I cannot tell which spice was used but it was something strong. It needed to be toned down just a hair. 2nd, Escargot. Very good. We did have a few pieces of grit, which is never pleasing. \n\nEntrees were: Lamb, Duck Breast, and King Filet. The lamb melted in your mouth. The flavor was superb. Stunning. The duck breast was cooked perfectly, full of flavor and also melted in your mouth. We did not care for the sauce served with it which was a \"sweet/sour\" sauce. The King filet was large, tender and very good. Again, only a small complaint which was that it was lacking in flavor. Something was missing... I ordered it with Bernaise which was spot on. \n\nDessert was a Rspberry Napoleon and Chocolate Sampler plate. Both excellent. They end dinner with some tasting sweets that are bite sized. None were particularly good and it was, in our case, unnecessary to receive them.\n\nOur service was outstanding. Anthony took very good care of us. He coursed us beautifully and was not bothersome. His server assistant was wonderful as well. We received a new plate and new utensils for every item we ordered. We never had to ask for anything. It was superb. \n\nOverall, a great experience which is really what it is all about. As locals, it was honestly a bit of a trek to get down there and park and walk clear across the casino to get to the restaurant but we are glad we did it. Definitely a memorable evening and I am sure we will do it again in the future."

We had a magical view overlooking the Bellagio fountains with the pretty--if Disneyesque--architecture of the Italian style buildings around the Bellagio lake.  In fact, even the restaurant itself felt like a Disneyworld restaurant.\n\nI'm not sure this would be my restaurant of choice (given the expense) if I were taking my wife.  I would take her to an equally expensive but more gastronomic choice in Vegas.  But, given that I had my 13 year old daughter, the choice couldn't have been better.\n\nThe food is pretty good but you can tell this isn't a chef of supreme talent.  My daughter's halibut was excellent.  My veal was a little tough and a tad over-cooked.  In other words, the food is perfectly fine but don't expect Eric Ripert from Le Bernardin or Thomas Keller from the French Laundry.  I wouldn't even put the food in a category of Mortons or Ruth Chris.  It's a half a step below these.  But, the view, the fun of riding the elevator and the overall experience made this a wonderful evening with my daughter who has raved about the restaurant.\n\nHere's what to expect for price (assuming appetizer, main and dessert) per person:\n\n$75 food\n$50 wine\n$10 tax\n$25 tip\n\n$150/per person"

I did a lot of research on French restaurants along the Strip and the price here to do pre-fixe dining is very reasonable considering the quality of food and level of service. Coming here is an experience. As soon as you enter the restaurant via the elevator ride up along the Eiffel Tower, you are transported to a world away from the loud hubbub of the casino floor and smoky smells of Sin City. Dress up in your finest and get ready for a night of elegance and affordable luxury. \n\nAs soon as you exit the elevator, there is someone there ready to take your coat and you are welcomed with an open view of the kitchen. It's glaringly bright, clean, and lively with the hustle and bustle of busy chefs running around. Then you step off to the side into the actual restaurant, which has a romantic ambiance with small tables, plush seating, and dim lighting. I made reservations for 5:30pm for 2, which gave us a nice table right in front of the windows for a clear view of the Bellagio fountains. It was spectacular. The tables allow for you to get close to your dining companion, which is perfect for a romantic date or just having an intimate conversation with a friend. We both opted to do the tasting menu for around $120ish per person. \n\nThe food was absolutely spectacular. The timing of the dishes was coordinated well so that we could enjoy the food, view, and conversation without feeling rushed. Everything we tasted was delicious and the presentation was beautiful and elegant. My favorites were the venison chop marinated in red wine, crayfish and shellfish soup, and lobster salad. All very memorable. For dessert, I had the classic chocolate souffle which was perfectly done. I also tried the apple dessert and the flavor combination was great. Their menu looks great. There's something to suit every palate. \n\nIf you're looking to try some delicious food in Vegas in an elegant restaurant with great views and personalized attention, I highly recommend coming to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. Thanks for the food memories!"

I ordered the warm lobster, braised leeks and celery appetizer. The sauce was rich and delicious, the lobster was delicate but boldly flavorful. It was perfectly seasoned. My wife ordered the blue cheese souffle pudding with a walnut pecan salad. She loved it. Loved it like she wanted to lick the plate clean loved it. Loved it like I had get a little pushy to try a bite loved it. \n\nFor an entree I ordered the duck prepared two ways--a sliced breast served medium-rare and a leg confit with wild rice and a rich sauce. Every bite was tender and juicy. My wife ordered the slow roasted filet of salmon with a pinot noir sauce. She said it was the best salmon she had ever tasted. We opted for a side of the pommes dauphines which were essentially mashed potato filled tater tots. Awesome. Every bit of our meal was amazing. We sipped on their signature cocktail the Eiffel Affair and ordered souffles for dessert. I went with the chocolate souffle and my wife had the grand marnier souffle. Both were delicious. Each came with a sauce (mine had a chocolate and a creme anglaise sauce). Probably the best dessert I've ever had. Thank you Eiffel Tower for making my belated honeymoon dinner worth it."

I have been lucky enough to go to the real Paris, France a few times and have had some very fine French food while there so of course I was prepared to label this the Vegas version, good enough for the tourist only. I was so wrong. They had a huge staff of chefs working the kitchen which you see as soon as you step off the elevator. The head chef Jean Joho certainly knows what he is doing. The appetizer of warm fois gras with crumbled bacon which I spread on a baguette was super rich and addictive. We also tried the seared scallop appetizer which were two of the best tasting giant scallops I have ever had with a sort of pesto flavored couscous on them. They were awesome. For entrees we had a house specialty which was a olive oil poached halibut which was absolutely the best fish I have ever had in my life. I personally had the seared rare duck which was also brilliant. Desserts were a caramel souffle that they began baking for us 40 minutes before we finished dinner so it was piping hot at the perfect time along with a fantastic creme brulee. We had a table facing the strip and the Bellagio fountains and while the sun slowly set and all the lights came up, made for an incredible view during dinner. This place will cost you, no doubt.

Also we wondered if we'd have to refill our own glasses, but we never had to worry about it, our waiter came around often and refilled before it could even get low. \n\nYou also get to chose from three or four different types of bread, as another waiter comes around with a tray of bread. I had the french bread and the wheat, they were both yummy, and you know how I love bread.

I had decided to email Jennifer requesting a window table for our special occasion, she answered within a couple days and had set everything up for us. \n\nWe were very impressed with the service we received from Ron Gonzales and the rest of the staff. Between the wonderful dinner, beautiful view and magnificent service our night was exactly what we had wanted and which put the priceless smile on my wife's face. \n\nWe do plan on coming back, and have already recommended the Eiffel Tower restaurant to our friends and family."

Besides the awesome view, our service was wonderful, and the food....oh the food... it was DELICIOUS!!  We're still talking about the parmesan flan!!  We would love to cleanse our palate with that every day!  At first, we were skeptical, but one taste and we were hooked.\n\nOur server, Todd S., was very friendly and efficient.  He made sure we had everything we needed was able to describe the menu items with great detail - helping us throughout the meal.\n\nWe tried the Seafood Salad, Crab and Avacado, Parmesan Chicken, and the soup.  The only minimal complaint was that the lettuce was cut too small.  Otherwise, everyone was happy with their choice.  \n\nWould definitely visit again!  Can't wait to share with more of our guests"

            "review": "I'm torn. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is not deserving of 5 stars, yet it's not bad -- thus my dilemma. At the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, the view trumps the food. But since we're talking about a restaurant, food should always trump everything else, with the view as a perk.\n\nWhen calling for a reservation, I inquired about a window seat. The man said the only way to guarantee the window at 6pm was through a special birthday dinner package, including a three-course dinner for 2, bottle of wine, professional photo at dinner, and an autographed restaurant cookbook. The package was an insane price, but since we were staying at another strip hotel for free, I thought, hey, we can spend something silly for dinner.\n\nSo here are my grades:\n-View: A+ (of course)\n-Presentation of food: A\n-Service: C (service was no better than what I'd expect at Applebee's)\n-Cauliflower pur\u00e9e/assorted breads: A \n-Mixed greens/creamy French onion soup: A\n-Chicken entree: A+ (I never knew chicken could be SO tender!)\n-Salmon entree: B- (underseasoned and did not taste super fresh)\n-Chocolate cake dessert: D (frozen, not sweet and didn't seem fresh; the presentation at least made up for the cake)\n\nWhile some dishes we ate (as well as the presentation and the window seat) were excellent, my main entree and birthday cake were disappointing. I felt a little slighted with dessert; to charge a customer such an enormous price for a fixed menu that includes chocolate cake as the only dessert option and to provide that customer such a lackluster dessert just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nOur server was attentive and professional but pretty mediocre. She never chatted with us and did not explain the dishes when they arrived at our table. Similarly, the hostess in the restaurant did not acknowledge us until we said hello, and she did not say goodbye or thank you as we left. (The hosts by the restaurant elevator on the casino floor were great.)\n\nWe had a great experience since the view of the Bellagio fountains was fantastic. Unfortunately, not everything we ate was fantastic, and the service was average. For what we paid, I was expecting food and service that would knock my socks off -- and we didn't get that. \n\nIn the end, because the food and service were not 5 stars for me, I don't plan on returning. I'm glad I went, though, and I enjoyed my experience."

TRES MAGNIFIQUE!!!  \nIt was our company's annual corporate meeting and we were treated to a wonderful dinner here.  The elevator doors opened to a bustling kitchen, and might I say CLEAN as a whistle.  White and sparkling.  We were then led off to the dimly lit dining room...very romantic and stylish the VIEW is what makes this place special.  The Bellagio Fountains directly in front of us.  Spectacular!  \nWe started with cocktails....I had a Blueberry Vodka/Soda with a lime twist.  Strong drink just like I like em....very nice.  \nUpon recommendation from our waiter, I ordered the rack of lamb as my entree.  This was the BEST lamb I have ever had.  Sooooooo tender and cooked to perfection.  It melted in my mouth.  It was served on a bed of a tomato puree with artichokes, which was equally as delicious.  We got several sides to share, my favorite being the Potatoes au Gratin (served in a mini cast iron dish- very cute).  The wine was flowing and I was in taste bud heaven!  \nAfter a while more of wine, dining and conversation, our desserts came.  Boss had ordered us 1 each of the different souffles...all were deeeelish but my favorites and the group consensus was on the Pistachio and the Chocolate.  Best souffle I have had!!!\nThe Petit Fours (I think that's what they are called) came around and I got the Chocolate Caramel...again....DELISH!  \nCapped off the evening with a fantastic champagne toast.....what an evening!!!  \nIt's pricey, so be prepared to drop some dollars here, but the experience is all worth it.  We had 5 star service, food and drink.  My ONLY complaint was the noise level, but it was so crowded how can you help that.  \nI can't wait to go back here!!!"

Our food was amazing (I'd recommend definitely getting the souffl\u00e9 for dessert). We had a minuscule mishap when I found a piece of plastic in my scallop potatoes but it was taken care of immediately. In fact we never even brought it up again because we didn't see it as a big deal but they comp'd us for the potatoes anyways. Seriously, everything was great. However, I forgot my phone at the restaurant and didn't notice until we were already back at our hotel. We called the restaurant and they snagged it for us and let us know they would hold it at their hostess stand. We dressed out of our nice clothes that we went to dinner in and out into casual clothes that we were going to gamble in. We headed back to Paris hotel and mentioned to the restaurant that we were only back to grab our phone. They allowed us up the elevator and back into the restaurant. As we are walking towards the hostess stand we were stopped by the greeter who asks us what we are doing. We tell her that we are only here to grab my phone because we had eaten there earlier and forgotten it. Her only reply to us is that we can't eat here because we are not dressed appropriately and will need to leave. We again mention that we just need my phone. She says ok and we get to the hostess stand. No problem there, we grab my phone and are walking back out. Literally 5 seconds. As we are waiting for the elevator to go back downstairs the chefs behind us start snickering and making mocking comments about how we can't eat here because there's a dress code. \"Uh you know there's a dress code, you can't eat here\" then more chefs laugh along at the mocking comments. We ignore them, half embarrassed because we were only here to pick up a phone and half disappointed because we had such high regards for this restaurant but now are being disrespected. We called the manager and he apologized up and down however we are still leaving the restaurant with a bad taste in our mouths with zero desire to return. Which really is upsetting because after our dinner we were already making plans to come back to Vegas and make the Eiffel Tower a must when we return. Now we would rather eat anywhere else."

            "review": "So begins the most expensive meal in my entire life. $89/person, 5 course tasting menu at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Paris Hotel, Las Vegas. Was it spectacular? Yes it was. It was SO good. I've paid almost as much at other restaurants, but never quite as much which is why this is the most expensive meal ever. It was also the most filling and best meal!\n\nMy friend wanted to go somewhere with a view (not necessarily to go someplace to EAT with a view) and I figured HEY when in Vegas why not go eat at a nice place with a view. So we decided to go up the mini eiffel tower to have a late dinner (9:30pm). We had a late lunch at the Wynn Buffet.\n\nMost of the entrees were close to $40. The appetizers were about $15-$20. So I figured why not go for the 5 courses for $89? It seems like an awesome deal. Triple the amount of food for double the price, essentially. The catch was everyone at the table had to do the tasting menu.\n\nCourse #1: Warm Maine Lobster Salad, Cauliflower and Romanesco\nIt was simply delectable. For a salad there wasn't enough green for me but there was tons of lobster. The lobster was juicy and I'm glad they took the meat out of the shell for me already, lOl. I think what really made the dish was the sauce. It was creamy but not overpowering. I'm not a fan of creamy sauces usually because it's soo creamy and it makes me feel thirsty after eating it but this was just the right amount of creaminess. It went really well with the lobster.\n\nCourse #2: Cream of French Green Lentils, Braised Ham\nOkay when they first brought out the plate/bowl it just had this tiny chopped up braised ham in the middle and I was thinking... that's it? This tiny tiny piece of ham. And then the server said \"wait, the soup is coming now\" and this other person poured the soup into the bowl. The look of relief on my face? Yes, yes there was. However it was brown and that put me off cause I've never had brown soup, so I thought it was mushroom soup. (Yeah.. we didn't really remember what our courses were suppose to be because they take the menu away from you!). Boy was I surprised when it actually tasted good! That's all I remembered how it tasted, just good. I don't even remember the flavors. Just that I wasn't disappointed.\n\nCourse #3: Filet of Red Snapper, Salsify, Blue Kale, Marjolaien and Pine Nuts\nMy FAVORITE dish of the meal & my life! It was SO freaking good. The red snapper was perfectly cooked. It was so juicy. I've had so many overcooked fish before and well mostly we like to deep fry the fish too. But this was just so good. Ughs, I don't know what those crispy things are called on top of the red snapper but they were SO GOOD. The best texture I've ever tasted. It was a great combination of crispy with the soft fish. The blue kale was great too! It wasn't overly salty like seaweed. This was a perfect dish.\n\nCourse #4: Venison Chop, Chestnut and Brussels Sprouts, Sweet Potato, Huckleberries\nVenison is deer meat! I did not know that. In fact when we were eating this we thought it was lamb. Wow. Nonetheless it was still a delicious piece of meat. I'm not a huge fan of lamb (mostly because I don't really eat it) but since it wasn't, I'm all confused. Because I thought the meat was gamey and a bit tougher than regular beef, so I knew it wasn't from a cow. Is lamb tough? However, reading about venison it seems that is the right texture for the meat. It's leaner meat than beef and has a tougher texture and tastes gamey. But I thought it was nicely seasoned. It really covered up the gamey taste. I only tasted a little so if it was suppose to be gamey without the seasoning and sauce I wonder how it would've tasted? Hms, I ponder. The sweet potato was a nice surprise. I thought it was mashed sweet potato when I first saw it but it's actually thinly sliced sweet potato. It was awesome! =) I'm also not a fan of Brussels sprouts but I don't know, I cleaned this plate and the other ones too. I ate EVERYTHING.\n\nCourse #5: Eiffel Tower Dessert - I chose Raspberry Napoleon, Vanilla Blanc, Manager\nOkay first off when they brought my dessert that little mound of vanilla JIGGLED. It was the most fascinating thing. I kept shaking my plate to watch the vanilla blanc jiggle, jiggle, jiggle. It was so hilarious. Yes, I am easily amused. Back to the dessert. Raspberries were sweet. There were tons of them. I love the cream filling. The coconut crisps were crispy and it was sweet and didn't taste much like coconut because I do not like coconuts. The vanilla blanc, although fun to watch, I felt wasn't sweet enough. It didn't have a strong vanilla presence so I felt like I was eating something pretty bland compared to it's partner the raspberry napoleon. Hms, maybe I should've eaten the vanilla blanc before the raspberry then it would've been tasty. Oh wells, I didn't eat it in that order.\n\nOverall it was FANTASTIC. I would definitely recommend coming here but only if you decide you want to spend the money."

I do understand that prices will be high for this sort of thing but the quality was there. Servers were very attentive and were very patient in explaining everything on the menu as well as offering fine suggestions with wine pairings. \nThe view.... this is why you come to this restaurant over others. The view of the strip was spectacular. Overlooking Bellagio, you can view the fountain shows (Minus the audio) while enjoying your meal. For couples, they have you facing outward as well for a nice extra touch.\nYou have to kind of get lucky to get this view seating however. Even if you make a reservation, when you show up, you can be seated right away to an available table, or you'll be asked to wait if you want a view table. We waited about 45 minutes for a view table which at first irritated me, but afterwards, I'm so glad we did. \nIf you're a tourist, or a local that is entertaining tourists, then this is a good place to make a good impression."

He read that this was one of the top romantic places in Vegas.  Imagine his surprise when we  arrive at a what can be best described as a madhouse.  People being herded in a line that took 20 minutes to get through.   After the crazy line, were asked to give our cell so they could text us when our table is ready. Very personal touch... Went to the bar to get a drink and wait and were TOTALLY IGNORED by three bartenders running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Romantic ambiance?  The elevator opened to, I am not kidding, the bustling, freaking kitchen!? How is that for  romantic?  As we entered the line, we passed an entirely too loud band playing what sounded like music appropriate only for a gin joint in the forties.  I kept expecting to see the lounge singer start stripping.  A romantic song was played once or twice, and I assume the loudness was to drown out the noise of the hundreds of people here.  We were acually seated at 7:30.  The most pleasant experince was the food, which was very good, but our \"waiter\" barely had four interactions with us.  When you pay almost 500 dollars for a meal, you expect great food served in an impeccable manner.   This place failed miserably to deliver the service aspect.  I felt SO bad for my husband,  because he kept apologizing for the choice to come here.  It's always the thought that counts and I was blown away only by his romantic gesture.  Only his wonderful company made the evening special. This place was almost a total waste of his money and for that I recommend that others not do the same.  For a better romantic and intimate experience,  I suggest Picasso ( where we went last year).  Really great food and truly top-notch service. Only the food makes this a two star review."

A delightfully fragrant, subtly sweet, and slightly strong drink -- the perfect definition of a cocktail.\n\nShortly thereafter, we were given a choice of bread to have.  While normally I would have picked a different bread to try each time around, I just couldn't get past having more of the wonderful french baguette -- rightfully so, considering the venue.  Then we were given a sample of gazpacho.  It was creamy and smooth being watery in neither flavor nor texture.  Thus it was obvious to me that the selection of vegetables, spices, and method was very deliberate.  To follow was an amuse bouche.  I had to ask the waiter twice what the trio was, and I still unfortunately forgot what they were exactly.  So instead of exact, I'll be broad: one was a fluffy, rich cheese-pastry; second was an oyster topped with caviar on a bed of black pepper and sea-salt; third was a mini quiche looking bite.  It succeeded in spurring my appetite for more.  For appetizers we ordered a corn soup and roasted foie gras.  The soup was the result of for some inexplicable reason that they don't serve french onion soup, which I would have considered a given.  Simple and tasty the soup was with a good marrying of ripe corn and hints of bacon.  The foie gras was luxuriously rich, and smartly paired with grapes and crisps for palate contrast and cleansing.\n\nOur main courses were the Aged New York Steak and Bone Marrow in a Cabernet Reduction as well as a Beef Wellington with Snap Peas.  I will say that my definition of medium-rare must differ from the kitchen's, but it's typically against my principles to argue with a chef's execution unless gross malpractice has occurred.  After just one bite, I forgot about any disagreement I might have had.  I was reminded that the quality of cut and preparation is at least as important as the method.  The marrow and reduction added a level of depth new to me with such a course.  The complex flavors still make me salivate at the mere memory of them.  The wellington was flawless in every way -- from presentation to indulgence.  The pastry shell advertised the culinary art contained.  It was flaky and refined.  Inside was a wonderfully tender, and expertly cooked, cut of beef.  More-so this course, I very easily would recommend it to anyone.\n\nDesert was a pair of souffles, that have to be ordered at the very beginning due to their complexity.  We had a gran marnier and pistachio.  Both light and delicious, which was the point of getting two.  I have to say I preferred the pistachio, but that is far from an easy decision to make -- I had to compare one to the other exhaustively.  The petit fours were simple treats of milk chocolate, fudge, white chocolate, or mango.  They definitely were unimpressive, but that's what happens when everything else was so far above standard.\n\nI had asked the photographer to return so that our photo would take place with the night lights of the Bellagio Fountains.  Not only did she, but she was enough of a perfectionist to wait for the exact right moment of the fountain show to snap the moment.  She also had our finished photo to us in what seemed like no time at all.\n\nA special note must be given to the server, Mario.  Not to be confused with the waiter (which for the first time for me, was not the same person).  He was an absolute pleasure to have around.  He was not only prompt and courteous in profession, but also charming and humorous in conversation.  It was the type of thing that beside all the foreign luxury we were surrounded in, there still was a sense of reality to ground the experience in memory instead of fantasy.\n\nI was denied the tower ride due to mother nature, but hopefully that will also encourage me to return again to at least shake Laurent Ertle's hand."

Overall not a good bang for the buck.\n\nI was running a bit late and joined my party about 20 minutes after they were already seated. A waiter with a faux french accent had taken their orders. We attempted to flag down Francois several times to no avail. I had to go to the bar myself to get a drink. 20 min later he came back with everyone else's food. He gave a faux apology and took my order, offering to rush my steak. I declined, not wanting to ruin a $50 entree. My New York steak came out pretty quickly. It was a good cut of meat, decently prepared, but nothing like Del Frisco's or the like.\n\nI have no problem shelling out some coin for fine dining. However I expect service to come with the price tag.\n\nIf you want the view, take the tour and go have dinner at Van Gogh."

            "review": "Food: 3.5/5\nAmbiance: 4/5\nServices: 4/5\nPrices: $$$$ (avg 100/person)\n\nMy partner and I were lure into taking the elevator to check out this place while waiting for our table at Mon Ami Gabi for lunch. We decided right away to make reservation for the night's early dinner, first due to the location being just opposite Ceaser's Palace so we can walk over to see Bette after dinner, second, its the view. We arrived 5.30pm for early dinner and its already 20% seated. We were given the window seat of course with the view of Bellagio's Fountain and the Strip. \n\nAgain, we went for the easy way - the 5 course Tasting Menu for $89/pax. According to the server, the course usually takes 2 hrs but we only got 1.5 hrs before the show, so, we asked to speed it up and we did... We started with a glass of champagne, then swiftly follow by these courses (as we requested):\n\nAmuse bouche - cant remember what but its something very similar to the parfait from L'Atelier. It was OK\n\nSoup - cream of lettuce, chicken quenelles and lettuce chiffonade. Sound really interesting but its really bland...\n\nBaked halibut, braised veges, tomato confit, pistou bouillon - the simpler but better tasted dish with fresh veges and a good portion of flaky halibut\n\n1pc of roasted rack of lamb - right texture, tender but lack of seasoning and flavor\n\nDesserts - i went for the pistachio souffle as highly recommended by the server with additional $6. Well, its a huge portion and if you are still hungry from the previous courses, then check this out, otherwise, you can go for the creme brulee or other smaller lighter desserts. The cheese plate before the dessert cost additional $10 which we opted out. In addition, the server will come with selection of bonbons if you order coffee. \n\nIn conclusion, Eiffel is a place for you to enjoy a romantic evening or just to impress your significant other or even for a small party with friends/co-workers. The food are decent but not as refined and definitely has potential to improve. That being said, if you dont mind forgoing the romantic setting and the view, I suggest to go L'Atelier Joel Robuchon for better food and slightly cheaper 5 course Menu!"

            "review": "Called today to make a reservation because I am going to Vegas for a getaway since my grandma died and my parents are getting a divorce after 27 years. For the past 2 years I have been having anxiety and othe problems such as depression and insomnia due to everything and it only got worse this past 2 months. So my kind enough boss paid for my get away to just relax with my boyfriend and get away from it all. \n\nI called to ask if they take emotional support animals because I've needed my dogs for my case. I have a written documentation from my doctor and everything stating that I need them because they are what ive always known and the only thing \"stable\" in my crazy life right mow. I spoke to the manager and he said yes we take service animals. I told him my dogs are not classified as service animal because under the law service animals help the blind, can call for help if there is a heart attack etc. But I do need my dogs with me 24/7. Here in Los Angeles they go everywhere with me even the bathroom when I'm in my own home. So I explained to him that they are emotional support. He said that's fine and had a girl make my reservations. \n\nWell I decided to celebrate my dogs birthday since her birthday is on 11-11 and the dinner was the day before so I explained that I was going to order something for them to eat such as an unseasoned beef patty or something instead of their usual kibbles. \n\nI get a call back immediately saying now I can't have dinner there because I was celebrating my dogs birthday and that i wanted a cake. I was like what I never once said cake and then he said well we don't allow dogs to eat at the table. And I said they are not eating on the table that's disgusting and unsanitary. Then I said they can eat on the floor. And he said not the floor either. So then I said ok well they need dinner but that's fine they won't eat. And he goes on cutting me off saying no I'm canceling ur reservation ur not allowed to come here with your dogs, we only allow seeing eye dogs. \n\nSo I'm fine with not eating there but then I asked him can u please tell me why I'm not allowed anymore when I first called and explained to u I'm not blind or handicapped and u were the one that said everything was fine. And he says well when I saw on the reservation that you were having your dogs birthday and u wanted a cake and them to eat, that is not our restaurants policy, I again I told him, no I never requested any cake and I said ey will bot be eating. And then he goes on saying well we only want service dogs. So which one is it? My dogs eating or your only allowed service dog, and he kept cutting me off and yelling at me saying I'm done speaking with u, etc. Definitely the worst service and discrimination against people with a mental illness and discrimination against dogs being fed,"

Since we had to wait, we tried to find a seat at a \nbar to make the wait extra special but when we sat down, we were rejected by the bartender saying there are people to be returned. (when there wasn't any one sitting there for few minutes we've watched and no glass, no drinks at the spot). \nNot an offer to find us another spot nor asked us to wait. We just had to walk around and asked other bartender if we were allowed to take a seat at a empty spot. \nNot So Pleasant Situation. (at a bar??? we have to ask.... at our anniversary... we just at least wanted a average service...)\n\nNothing special about the service by the water.\nFood was okay to be honest. We ordered 2 steaks, 2sides, wine, and a drink.\n\nWe just felt mistreated... I guess I was expecting a good service but it was supposed to be a fun and hangout atmosphere than a well service, fine dining.\n\nDidn't reach my expectation..."

The view was stunning. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the wait staff was very professional. They were able to rearrange a dinner time for us, as we were running late with a previous event we were attending. Fantastic customer service. The majority of the food however, was terrible. I had the Alaskan cod with asparagus on the side. It wasn't to my taste. My husband ordered duck, which (to him) seemed a little better than the cod, but still wasn't great. The butter that is provided with your bread, however, is fantastic (I don't know what they do to it). If you go into it and acknowledge that you're paying for the view and the atmosphere, you'll do fine."
