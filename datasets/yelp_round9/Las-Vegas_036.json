            "review": "I absolutely, positively love this place!  Even if I'm in Vegas for only a few hours, I stop here before leaving. \n\nI like to try different things every time I visit, but I always include the Orange Chicken, no matter what. It's so full of flavor & spice (they will alter the spice level to your liking), and it's cooked to a perfect crisp. I like it with brown rice. Orange Chicken is a must!\n\nGeneral Tso Chicken is good, just not as excellent as the Orange Chicken. \n\nKung Pao Beef is ok. It didn't do anything for me in the knock-my-flavor-socks-off department. \n\nSpicy Hon Hon Shrimp is good. It's supposed to be crunchy, but mine wasn't. I think it would better with a crunchy batter. \n\nIt is a 100% vegetarian establishment, but everything I have had was vegan, and other dishes can be made vegan, just ask. Particularly if you're getting fried rice, otherwise, you'll get eggs in your food. So again, be sure to let them know if you're vegan. \n\nNice clean restaurant. Super friendly and helpful staff. Accepts credit cards (there is a minimum order amount; I think @ $6). \n\nCall ahead for carry-out orders. To-go orders come in nice reusable containers. \n\nCan be tricky to find for first time visitors. It's in Chinatown.  If you're coming from The Strip (Las Vegas Blvd), turn west onto Spring Mountain Rd. Stay on Spring Mountain Rd and once you pass Decatur Blvd, you'll see the Pacific Asian Plaza on your left. It's located on the 2nd level of the strip mall, west of the supermarket."

I loved the Cajun catfish and would definitely order it again- this batter had great flavor and texture....although could have used more spice since they describe it as being spicy. \n\nThe service was excellent and they brought me extra chili paste per request. This is a great place for vegetarians and nonvegetarians. I will be back to try more things."

Not only is everything vegan but authentically prepared and tastes just as amazing as many of the Chinese restaurants nearby. I found the ambience to be charming with gazebos for larger parties and a little waterfall/pond feature. The staff were attentive and courteous. The crowd was diverse. I will definitely come back over and over again. Don't skip this gem!"

            "review": "It's upstairs in the same plaza as the SF Supermarket on Decatur & Spring Mountain (even though Yelp maps indicated Jones & Sahara). The inside is VERY nice looking. Decently sized and with the amazing decorations inside, it makes me want to bring in a group of 8 and sit under one of the designated family-style tables.\n\nService was prompt except it wasn't busy at all so they had a lot of time to go to us in the beginning. By the end, though, they stopped coming over as often. They were nice and helpful and I was also reading the Yelp reviews to see what was recommended.\n\nWHAT WE ORDERED:\n2 cold items combo $6.95: seaweed stem & cucumber\n-- This wasn't too shabby. I definitely liked the cucumber. Maybe not so much the seaweed but it wasn't too bad. The sauce was nice :0).\n\nSalt Pepper Fried Tofu\n-- I love mostly everything salt & pepper so I really wanted to taste it. It was pretty good and my friend liked it. We also dipped it in other sauces but I preferred soy sauce. You can slightly taste the salt & pepper so it wasn't that strong for me.\n\nVeggie beef rolls\n-- Last year I had an influx of beef rolls so I definitely think this played into my taste buds. They were good in their own way but a bit too soft for me. And of course, the meat isn't really our typical meat, since it's faux meat, but it wasn't too shabby. If you're a fan of beef rolls, I would recommend you trying. I tried it due to a yelp review but I've since stopped eating beef rolls. Had enough to last me a few years :0b.\n\nDuring your lunch/dinner, you might have a few chirping birds around ;). Beware, haha!\n\nI'll definitely be back!"

            "review": "Having grown up in Singapore...Chinese vegetarian meals were a staple of my diet especially when we were eating out. The cuisine was essentially Chinese food with heavy Southeast Asian influences. \n\nWhen I came down to Veggie House, I was overjoyed to see the menu resembling what I was familiar with down by the Equator. And then, I found out that chef/owner Kenny Wang is a Malaysian! Mystery solved. \n\nThe dishes that I have thoroughly enjoyed here include the following:\n\nRoti Canai - With a heavenly curry dipping gravy that is ditto what I used to savor in Southeast Asia\n\nPork Chop - You can get a half order of this. Very inventive - 3 different textures (soft, fatty and then crispy) welded together and deliciously seasoned\n\nBraised Tofu - The preparation of tofu is just fantastic. Soft beancurd lightly fried and then immersed in a brown gravy. Perfection. The vegetables on this dish were also so crisp and fresh!\n\nCurry Vegetables with Tamarind Sauce - I love this take on curry. In Asia, it's called Assam Curry and is widely available and one of the most popular and tasty dishes. However, it's seldom prepared well outside Southeast Asia...Kenny's done a stellar job. Crispy potato pieces, brimming with veggies in a delicious curry sauce with that amazing tamarind tinge. \n\nFried Rice and Flat Noodles - Yummy. Prepped the way I love it. Simple, tasty and satisfactory. \n\nPrices are very reasonable. Less than $7 for a lunch special (choice of brown/white rice or bread) served with soup. The restaurant itself is very pleasant...bright, clean and reasonably furnished. I love the waitresses. They are awesome!\n\nCan't wait to be back at Veggie House!"

            "review": "Came here with hubby during our weekend Vegas trip.  We both agreed that the food was delicious and we're really impressed by how much the presentation and texture of the vegetarian meat resembled the real thing.  We ordered the beef roll as an appetizer.  It was really really good.  The texture, presentation, and taste were all there.  Other dishes that we ordered were orange chicken, spicy eggplant fries, and pineapple duck.  The orange chicken was delicious.  Just looking at the dish, it looks just like the orange chicken that you'll find at a Chinese fast food.   Took a bite and said to me hubby, \"wow, this is chewy, just like chicken.\"  I recommend the spicy eggplant fries.  Just the right amount of spiciness and very crispy.  The pineapple duck was okay.  The presentation was good, but the flavoring was a bit bland.  This is our least favorite dish of the ones we ordered, but still impressed by how closely the presentation and texture resembled the real thing.  Next time we're in Vegas and wants vegetarian food, we'll come here again to try other dishes."

I'm glad I ventured outta my comfort zone & tried something new.\n\nNaturally, our group of 4 decided to try a little bit of everything: fried eggplant & a Happy roll as appetizers, followed by 2 types of \"shrimp,\" \"scallops,\" and a \"beef\" dish as our main course(s). All of which were superb! My personal favorite was the spicy hon hon \"shrimp!\" ...and honestly, I could say I like this version of \"shrimp\" way better than the original.\n\nWe were seated & served right away, and the food came out fairly quick --- no complaints here! I'll definitely be dining here again soon."

The staff are friendly and accommodating. The food is absolutely fantastic and it will definitely fool the hardiest of meat lovers. I tried the walnut shrimp (highly recommend!) sesame chicken, crispy beef and broccoli, and the general tso chicken. I also tried the pineapple duck which was absolutely disgusting! The texture was very spongy and the taste was so gross, we had to waste the entire thing. It tasted like a sponge marinated in liquid smoke, soy sauce, and pineapple juice. Anyway, I highly recommend this place in any direction and it's very refreshing to have a vegan eatery. Hopefully Vegas will catch on to more vegan eateries!"

I was hooked! \nOur favorites include Kenny's spinach salad, crispy beef, lotus root cakes, broccoli beef and sweet and sour pork. \nThe staff is always super friendly and they will always help you with the menu. It is always a good time when you go there too, because Kenny will always come out and talk to you. If it's not too busy he will sit down at your table. His story is really amazing and he is a super guy! If you have been there a few times and have a feel for the menu, you can tell Kenny what you like and he will make you food based on what you tell him! We have had him do that twice with the chow main noodles, and we have yet to be disappointed! If chef Kenny ever gets on the Food Network or the Travel Channel WATCH OUT because he will explode! His food is so YUMMY! If I could do what he does in the kitchen, there is no question that my family and I would all be enjoying the vegan lifestyle!!!"

Everything is vegetarian, so when you see orange chicken on the menu, it's not actually orange chicken, it's vegetarian soy product that looks like chicken with orange sauce which is really tasty!  Their dishes can be really creative like the fish dishes where it really looks like fish, and the fish skin is dried seaweed to add texture. Very well done.\n\nupdate 2/9/13:\nLunch specials from 11am-3pm everyday!!! Came here twice for lunch and the lunch specials are pretty good as it includes soup, white or brown rice (no extra charge) or a steamed bun, and the main entree. The portions for lunch specials are large enough to do family style with a couple people. The other day we also tried some dinner items and were equally impressed such as the japanese pumpkin with silky tofu and vegetables. YUM!  The spicy eggplant is not really spicy as it is sweet, but they are perfectly fried and I would be happy to eat those instead of french fries. \n\nJust a reminder that the entire place has no meat. So if they menu says beef, chicken, fish, it's not actually meat it is a soy product that looks like meat, but it tastes pretty authentic. \n\nService is very quick too so if you need a fast place for lunch, this is a great healthy spot."

I loved the hints of Thai basil and ginger--could have used even more of both.   We asked for it spicy (5 out of 10), but it arrived without heat.   The waitress kindly brought a small dish of chili pepper sauce.   There was really enough for 2 on this $10 entree.  \n\nNow for the shrimp with walnut sauce, which was surprisingly horrible.   The shrimp itself was probably OK, but it was slathered up with soy mayonnaise.   It was visually unappealing as well.   We asked Chef Kenny about the sauce and he returned moments later proudly holding a jar of store bought soy mayonnaise.    This is one short cut that should have been avoided.   Chef Kenny--please rethink this dish.   It would have been a winner if you had 3 dipping sauces for the shrimp.   Perhaps a sriracha sauce (siracha blended with soy mayo), a curry sauce, or a cilantro sauce.  Email me and we can work on this together.  I can visualize this dish with 3 little dipping bowls on the plate with a little cilantro or basil garnish.   Clean, colorful, simple, and gives the customer the choice of condiments.\n\nOh, enter the restaurant from the front which faces Spring Mountain Rd.   Just go up the stairs and look for Suite 203 in the corner in the middle of the mall.   If you park around back, you will miss the beautiful entry way.    \n\nI'll definitely return for more of the savory-type entrees and see if I can change my rating to 5 stars."

It's a good feeling of full without actually physically feeling like you're gut is going to explode. \n\nRecommendations?\nIce cream is always a good choice as they get supplied from Perfect Scoop so expect yummy high quality hand made ice cream 100% of the time, all the time.\n\nThe crispy spicy beef has got to be one of the greatest items on the menu. Not judging this based on taste, if this was a taste game then the rating would be 5 stars not 4. This is due to the texture of the faux beef. Other items such as the kung pow beef or beef with broccoli the texture is close to a tofu like mushroom and carries a similar taste if it wasn't for the sauces.\n\nSo overall this place is definitely worth a stop for lunch but dont expect a 100% accurate vegetarian replacement for meat.\n\nAs for the vegetarian alternatives for fish...we'll see about that in the updated review...\n\nYelp 100 - 034 of 100"

But only because I barely touched the Sizzling Shrimp Plate, which I might add was not sizzling upon its arrival (that's the fun & exciting part of watching your food come to the table, but this wasn't the case here)\n\nKung Pao Chicken: did have some good flavors, we requested a 8/10 in the spice level but it was probably less. It was still good but not worth coming back for in my opinion.\n\nSizzling Shrimp Plate: All of it tasted like it was probably steamed for a few seconds then maybe saut\u00e9ed after in a very flavorless sauce. It was undercooked and almost raw, lacked flavor, and the faux shrimp had an odd texture.\n\nI am sad to say that I did not enjoy it at all like I thought I would."

            "review": "ahhh man....I was so excited after reading the reviews that I think my expectations were too high. I am from an area in southern California that has a lot of vegan options so I have had really fantastic vegan food. Plus I personally make 3 meals a day for my family so I used to eating clean healthy food. I was very disappointed with my experience here. When I walked in I was greeted and seated immediately. It was a typical Vegas hot day so I was super thirsty. After being seated we didn't even get water till at least 10min after being seated. The waitress and chef were so interested in schmoozing with customers they knew rather than being attentive to new customers. After stressing that I REALLY would like some water my waitress brought a full pitcher of water to what I thought was going to be my table but instead filled the glasses of the table next to me! really?!\n\nIn addition to no meat or diary my family also avoids oil. So I told the waitress to have my meal made w little oil as possible. One dish came back un-edible. The reason I didn't give a one star rating was because the chef immediately scooped that dish off our table and had them make us another dish. The second dish was good except why all the sauce? It was more like a soup dish than a noodle dish. My recommendation would be to ask for ALL sauces on the side. They completely saturate their dishes in sauce and its like eating soup. too bad.... I will not go back here nor would I recommend it unless you are ok with fried, oily, sauce saturated meals. \n\nIt was also a turn off to see the chef pull up a chair and sit with customers bragging about himself. If you are a regular and you know the chef then you are definitely treated more special. If you are not  or are from out of town prepare to get the stink eye and treated like an annoyance."

There's a reason Veggie House has a 5 star Yelp rating, and the reviews weren't written by infants. I just think it's worth noting that when we entered the restaurant, my daughter was awake and started to become a little fussy. However, I think a combination of the Chinese serenity chimes music and the soothing waterfall next to our table helped her drift off into a nap while we ate. The dining room was quiet with only 2 other tables occupied. (I shouldn't make these claims without mentioning that you won't find a table for diaper changes in the rest room.)\n\nThe roti with curry sauce was great as an appetizer, and the crispy eggplant was as good as other reviewers have noted. I liked the ginger in the flavorful sauce coating the eggplant fries. My husband enjoyed his \"chicken\" fried rice, but the flavor of this dish (maybe from the egg) was not at all appetizing to me. I've had some bad experiences looking for vegetarian entrees in various Chinatown restaurants, so I'm excited to return to Veggie House to try more of the menu! Both waitresses were very friendly and the service shined, down to demonstrating how to tear the roti with forks and dip it in the curry sauce. The chef uses quality ingredients and puts care into each dish. I'll stick to the tofu and vegetable options, as I don't want any fake shrimp floating around on my plate. While they offer everything from veggie goose to veggie ribs, I didn't become a vegetarian to eat fake meats."

And I am saying that as an extreme critic and chef myself.\n\nUnlike any restaurant I have ever been to, the staff knows everything about every ingredient on the menu.  What it is, what its made of if its a processed vegan meat, what allergies it could effect (if you don't eat corn or what, etc).  They know about all the recipes and can tell you all about them.  And they are super passionate about what they do.  They want to share this information with you.  Unlike many waitresses who find it a hassle to be quizzed about how things are made and what goes into them.  These waitresses are happy and eager to share this information with you\n\nNow lets get into what you will eat here.  What you will find here is one of the very few authentic asian cuisine restaurants in the United States.  They make all sorts of hardcore asian dishes.  Like shark fin soup.  Or roast goose.  But guess what?\n\nTHEYRE ALL 100% VEGAN!!!\n\nYes thats right, 100% vegan goose meat!  Made out of vegetables!\n\nEven on the door there is a sign that says \"no animal products may enter this premises\"\n\nBut don't worry meat eaters!  This place is amazing!  Everything tastes super great!  The chef here is a world famous chef!\n\nI even brought my father there who is a meat and potatos kind of american guy.  You know the type.  hes an old fashioned macho farmer, grew up on a dairy farm.  And even he loved it!  And he wasn't just being polite!  Hes teh kind of guy who will say if he doesn't like something.  And when he was looking at the menu he wasn't sure about any of the dishes, didn't think they were the kinds of things he would like.  So he just let me order and he ended up likeing everything!\n\nAnd the atmosphere is really nice here, but still casual, not stuffy.\n\nAnd the owner actually came around to introduce himself and make sure we felt welcome, just like good restaurant owners used to.  He was a very friendly and personable man.  He spoke with us for about 2-3 minutes and I will always remember that.  \n\nThis is a restaurant experience you really shouldn't miss if you are in vegas.  It is a real treat."

The owner said that I couldn't use the Groupon and told me to call Yelp about it, he kept my food and told me to come back if I figured it out. \n To me it would have been simple to re-ring the order and not waste the food but he just told me to leave. I still have the Groupon and I will go back once more because of that but I won't be eating here anymore. There is another all vegan restaurant of a similar style near by so I will try them out. It's a shame too because the food is excellent and I was even excited to try the chef's new location but the service left a bad taste in my mouth.\nAs a business, If you only want to participate in services like Yelp,Eat24 and Groupon for the publicity and you aren't really interested in honoring the deals then you really should just by a commercial."

Yes, many of the plates are a daring simulacrum of your favorite proteins. The joy of this place is that the food is just as good while being much more sustainable, healthy and ethical in practice. I myself am not a strict vegetarian but I respect those who are. Moreover, the chef himself is highly regarded and conscientious about his recipes. \n\nThe delivery option here is good, but I would recommend you jist bring yourself in. These dishes succeed because of their hard earned texture which gets a bit lost for some items in the ride of over. If you do order take out then choose options like the orange chicken which will be just as good and avoid crispy items that would obviously become soggy. It is no different than if ordering fish and chips to go - don't ever do it."

My husband and I went here for lunch and all the smaller tables were full so we were told to wait. I noticed all 5 large tables were empty, but I thought whatever. I know sometimes restaurants leave tables empty because theyre short staffed. So we sit and wait. And wait. And wait. Then a party of 5 walks in and theyre seated RIGHT AWAY at one of the larger tables. I ask her why we cant sit at a larger table and she says \"oh no, I cant put just 2 people at the big table.\"\n\nThats ridiculous! There were 4 more large tables empty. You really think 4 large parties are going to walk in?? You think a party of 5 will be quicker than a party of 2??? She told us we have to continue to wait til a smaller party left - so we just left instead. I wont even bother coming in next time... Bye."

Upon entering the restaurant, I was sure to inform her that we(my partner and I) wanted to redeem our groupon so any necessary preparations could be made. She interrupted snarkily and asked us if we wanted to dine in or dine out in such a manner that it seemed as though she was annoyed with us already, although we had only been in the restuarant about 5 minutes or so. After opting to dine in, she \"led\", which is a nice way of saying scurried along hurriedly while expecting us to keep pace with her rushing to get us out of her hair, to a table and then proceeded to toss our menus onto the table(not an exaggeration, she literally threw them onto the table), point to our seats and promptly walk off.\n\nOur waitress, on the other hand was wonderful: friendly, professional, and courteous. Unfortunately, our prior encounter with the hostess made us reluctant to stay there, and I informed her that we would like to change our order to take out.\n\nAfter awkwardly having to deal with the hostess, who by this time was almost giving us the ice cold \"I can't believe you changed your order, make up your mind, I hate customers like you\" stare, we then sat there for the next 15-20 minutes for the food. Soon before we left, the hostess begins to seem amiable, and attempted to make small conversation with my partner and I. At this point we were beyond frustrated and upset, so we were not receptive to her advances. \n\nWhat a shame, because when I finally got to the car to try my food, it was absolutely delicious!\nI'm not sure I would give this place another visit again, but if you're willing to try some good food with some bad service, give this spot a shot."

Located on the 2nd floor, close by the stairs.\n\nAnyways, when we entered, on Christmas Eve a little before 6:30 pm, we waited about 10-15 minutes for a table for 2. After we were finally seated and looked over the menu, we ended up ordering:\n\nTurmeric Salad, $5.95 prior to tax- This salad automatically comes with the dressing on the side. I really liked this salad. It is made with a mix of the healthy dark green leafs, Romaine lettuce and spinach. The flavors were good, especially the dressing. And this is a great starter to share with another person. \n\nCurry Duck, $12.95 prior to tax- I thought this curry duck was good, but my husband really liked this more. I thought the \"duck\" itself was average, and wished the texture was better. I liked the sauce of this dish. I liked that there were braised green beans in this entree. This dish is good, but not as good as I was hoping it would be. I probably wouldn't order this again.\n\nSpicy Veggie Crispy Beef, $13.50 prior to tax- The texture of this entree is very similar to beef. I really liked the flavors of this dish as well. I thought the sauce was good. I liked the chopped nuts (well I think they are nuts, but they may have been something else) on top of the beef and I also liked that there were a few broccoli florets on this plate, but would have been nice to have a little bit more. \n\nBoth the curry duck and crispy beef entree came with your choice of brown or white rice. My husband and I opted for the brown rice (which was made perfectly).. \n---------------------\n(Total= $35.02 after tax, prior to tip)\n\nService was good for the most part. Our server was nice and gave good recommendations. I appreciated his input when I asked him what his opinion was for some of the menu items. But we did wait quite a while to get our check and to get our boxes to take home some of our leftovers. \n\nBy the way, there is a $6 credit card minimum and there is also free WiFi here (chefkenny, one word). \n\nThere is also one single men's restroom and one single women's restroom. The women's restroom was clean upon this visit and stocked with the essentials. \n\nThe 4 employees working here all speak English and are nice. They are more than happy to explain any of the menu items. \n\nWill definitely come back here again. Would like to try their veggie happy roll and some of their lunch specials."

The \"fish\" in the curry was made of bean curd and seaweed to give it a fishy taste. I was initially put off by it because it felt like I was biting into a sponge. Once I got past the textural issues, it did not taste bad at all. I am curious about their other meat substitutes. Nowadays, imitation chicken and beef has come a long way. \n\nVeggie House might not be the first place to come to mind when I think Chinatown, but it is not on the no go list.

I heard Chef Kenny say to the couple he was speaking to about how he employs chefs that are also vegetarian.

So you won't be completely lost about all the faux on faux on faux they got here.  \n\nMy hubby and I tried the Shark Fin soup, Oyster Mushroom with Lime Grass, and the Spicy Beef.  Soup was okay, a bit salty for me, the other 2 dishes were bursting with flavor.  BUT they were both fried and the flavor from one of the dishes was drenched in sauce.

Is fake chicken really that different from cow guts?  Well yes, but..... what I'm saying is: don't be afraid to try it!\n\nChinatown isn't exactly the easiest place for vegetarians to visit - a menu can be daunting enough as it is, but then to throw in the question \"is there any (chicken stock/fish sauce/bonito flakes/meat bits) in this dish?\" and be prepared to blow some minds, including your own.  I don't enjoy blowing minds so sadly I don't visit many places in Chinatown.\n\nBut hey!  Don't fret, vegetable lovers!  Veggie House is awesome and will fill your Asian-food cravings.  They have a huge menu which always throws me for a loop (I'm not used to so many choices!) and everything they offer is vegan.\n\nThe first time I visited Veggie House, I made the mistake of trying to be healthy and ordered an all-veggie stir fry dish.  It wasn't bad, but I've come to find out that they specialize in fake meats.  Now, I've been a vegetarian for over six years so I'm not the best person to ask on how much the fake meats taste like the real deal but I'm going to go ahead and guess \"not very.\"  I also want to say that I don't care because I find the food here delicious.\n\nThings I've had that are really great: General Tso's chicken, crispy beef, orange beef, sizzling chicken (think an Asian version of fajitas), and curry roti.\n\nThings I've had that are skippable: vegetable soup, spring rolls, the happy sushi roll (way too much of a fishy taste for me, but my husband liked it).\n\nService is friendly and the restaurant is clean and large.  My only complaint is that I wish the items were a dollar or two cheaper so that I could feel better about ordering a third item to share with my husband instead of the usual two (yes, I'm a pig).  But fake meats can be pricey so I understand.\n\nA restaurant that has an entire menu I can order from!  Take that, Chinatown!"

It tasted like plain (but perfectly cooked) tofu.\n\nEven for the veggie meats that we all didn't like - the presentation was so, so amazing. It all looked exactly like the \"real\" meat it was mimicing.\n\nThe service was beyond excellent. Attentive and chipper even when we had a big party and the rest of the restaurant was packed.\n\nEven though I personally (a carnivore) did not like how certain things tasted, I have to admit I would definitely come back here anytime and explore more items on the menu. Probably leaning towards the veggie chicken items."

This place is on the second floor in a strip mall containing a grocery store.  It wasn't that hard to find, and once there, boy was I HAPPY!  Try the lettuce rolls - they're fantastic!  I also loved the vegetables in curry and tamarind.  Kenny (Owner/Chef) is always there, and he will make things any way you like.  I ate there three nights in a row - as it was so good!!!!"

It is sometimes hard to find vegan options at your favorite restaurants! This place is genius, everything is 100% vegan and it taste so delicious, better than most authentic Chinese cuisines I've been to. I've always dreamed of a fully vegan Chinese place because that's usually my go to, Chinese takeout. I discovered this place from a coworker and I fell in love with it. I try to go as often to try ALL of their options, they have a huge menu full of appetizers (dumplings, wontons, salads, soups), noodle plates, \"meats\", \"seafood\" plates, fried rice, even a desert menu that offers vegan ice cream and cheesecake! It's absolutely phenomenal and it is worth a try if you're near the area. The staff is also very nice and friendly, chef Kenny is amazing at his work!"

It took 10 years to get him to come with us anywhere as he suffered from the notion that being vegan means eating only bird seed & tofu & he even later admitted that he & my mother in law went to eat before they came to join us. So they only had small plates in front of them but they kept putting food on those plates !! He loved it !! Next time he came to town he asked \" Hey can we go to that vegan place again ??\" He's also since gone to LA Vegan with us (in LA where he lives) & loved it too !!\n\nWe like sitting on the round tables where they have the movable center piece so everyone can share each other's food. Get a taste of everything !!\n\nWe LOVE the Roti with Curry (Amazing !!) the General Tao (which they always anticipate me ordering - don't even have to ask) & the Happy Rolls sushi .. but everything is so good !! My wife always gets the spicy eggplant or Sesame Chicken.  \n\nAnd Chef Kenny is such a great guy .. so generous he'll walk around the dining room greeting guests & has even offered to help people shop at the Chinese market underneath Veggie House !! \n\nGo today & take your favorite carnivore .. they'll be amazed !!"

I'm glad to say that the quality has been maintained, and I had a real solid meal.\n\nYou know the deal with vegetarian restaurants.. They are normally pretty awful. That is because top chefs do not like to be limited on what they can or cannot cook. (they also love meat!) Fortunately, in the hands of the talented Chef Kenny, the dishes here are executed to a high degree, and one can be forgiven for confusing a faux meat dish with the real deal.\n\nFollow the Yelpers advice for ordering at this place. I rarely say this because people have slightly different palettes. But, I believe due to Chef Kenny's consistency, anyone can have a good meal. The spicy crispy eggplant is really good. They reminded me of portobello fries. The crispy beef was another winner. Even though I love the taste of beef, and that was obviously missing, the texture was really good. But, I wasn't a big fan of the faux chicken dishes, but they were good for what they were. I also didn't get the ice cream over sticky rice, I'll be scratching my head over that one for a while.\n\nI'm a pure carnivore. That is how I will be for the rest of my days.

This place is 100% vegetarian, all of their \"meats\" are made from tofu and/or cornstarch. They can also make things egg free as well. The atmosphere was nice and quite and the waitresses were on point about bringing more tea, napkins etc.\n\nThe crispy beef is so god damn good. Bomb is an understatement. It looks, smells and tastes like Chinese beef!\n\nThe orange chicken was just as good, but I liked the beef better.\n\nTheir shrimp looks just like real shrimp and basically has the same texture. I personally wouldn't order it again, I just didn't care for the taste.\n\nThe wontons were amazing, I don't know exactly what's in them but they were pretty damn good. We just wished it came with more since there was four of us and we ended up with an odd number.\n\nTom Yum Soup, never heard of it till then but BEWARE: It is shit your pants spicy! If you enjoy eating hot lava, then you will probably love this soup. But if I were you, I would just spare your butthole the fiery burn that you will inevitably experience later on, and avoid the Tom Yum Soup.\n\nDefinitely want to try everything on the menu, the Chef is more like a scientist, I don't know how he does it, but I like it."

The high reviews were also convincing enough for me to give it a shot.\n\nMy friends and I ordered fish, crispy noodles with vegetables and \"shrimp,\" and crispy beef. You can obviously tell the fish wasn't really fish. It reminded me of tofu, but with a crispy lining which serves as the skin. The sauce was very salty, but was tasty nonetheless. The crispy noodles were good and I have to give props for the shrimp because it looked real and tasted good. My favorite dish is the crispy beef. The taste and texture reminded me of beef, but it didn't have much substance. It was like eating something with a lot of air pockets. \n\nThe location is in a plaza with other Asian restaurants. I might give this place another shot and see if their other dishes are good. The overall flavor profile I got from this place is saltiness, but it could have just been due to what I ordered."

Today I was in a fairly weird mood and couldn't quite decide on what I wanted but I love to wander into places. I stopped in this shopping mall and wandered through a couple places before I finally decided on Veggie House. When I looked at the menu the price was right and the options sounded more like what I was hungry for on a cold day.\n\nI walked in and was quickly seated. The server quickly got my drink order and I had a big pot of green tea to warm me up. I decided on the General Tzo chicken, which is not really chicken but I'm ok with that. It came with a yummy house soup that was this tasty celery broth that I could have eaten a gallon of, but luckily just had the cup. Not long after I finished that up the server promptly brought out my \"chicken\" and brown rice. It was the perfect lunch size and I ate the whole thing happily. Even though it was fried, the \"chicken\" was greasy and the sauce was tasty.\n\nThe grand total for lunch and green tea was less than $9 so score one for an affordable, quick, tasty lunch.\n\nI would definitely go back here and try some of their other dishes. If you are looking for vegetarian or not, Veggie House is definitely a great restaurant in Chinatown."

The menu says \"roast pork\" or \"chicken stir fry\" but it's absolutely 100% meatless even though some of the dishes tastes like real meat.\n\nI think the chef is caught in between wanting to cater to authentic Chinese tastes, & those who are used to less authentic tastes. So four stars bc while a few of the dishes were sooo awesome, a few were overly sweet like it was for a different audience. However, they are a clean restaurant. The oil they use to fry foods is changed frequently and doesn't have that old/stale taste some places have. \n\nThe service was great, very friendly and helpful. Place was clean and quiet when my party of four went (Monday night around 6pm). I'm definitely coming back!! \n\nThis is what we got: \nCantonese fish: made from tofu with crispy seaweed on top that took on the role of the fish's skin. It looked more like grilled fish than it tasted, but I love tofu so I enjoyed this a lot. \n\ncrispy beef: tofu based too, but this is the one dish that if I didn't know was vegetarian, I would've thought was a delicious beef dish. It was tasty. Perfectly crispy though a little too sweet. \n\nChicken hot plate: I loved this one. It was also tofu based and delicious. You can tell it was imitation meat, but this dish wasn't overly sweet. Great smoky flavor to the fake chicken with lots of fresh crisp veggies. I love how Chinese cooking has vegetable dishes where the veggies are both crisp and saucy. My fave :) \n\nScallop pan fried crispy noodle: too sweet, but the noodles were crispy and good. The scallops were a form of big mushroom (the literal Chinese to English translation of the mushrooms are chicken leg mushrooms) that was breaded and fried. This was okay, I wouldn't order it again. \n\nFried eggplant: sweet eggplant sliced like French fries. Had a sticky and crispy texture which was interesting. Like caramel stickiness to it. I thought it was too sweet again but interesting. In all my 31 years of eating Chinese food I have literally never eaten a dish like this before. Wouldn't order it again but didn't regret it. \n\nOverall: yum!! I'm coming back for sure :)"

For a vegan restaurant, I noticed the place was full of overweight people and now I know why.  Everything is covered in sugar sauce and comes with only white rice.  Not much spice was detected in the sugar sauce. \n\nMaybe I expected too much from this place, based on the glowing reviews.  I think people are just getting mesmerized by the fact it is all vegan.

I'm glad I've found a place where I can indulge myself with Chinese food and feel healthy at the same time. My brother and I tried this place out since Shuseki was still closed (around 4:30pm) and we were famished. Knowing he's a bit of a health buff I told him I knew that there was a Vegan/Vegetarian place in the same plaza. *I know that Hue Thai also serve imitation meat but I forgot about that until now.\n\nMy brother ordered their barbequed pork appetizer and I got the salt and pepper fried fish. We ordered these to really test this place out. When our food arrived I was almost confused since the dishes really looked like the \"original.\" His bbq pork didn't have any hint of \"I'm not really meat\" texture. If I didn't know it was vegan meat I would assume it's the real deal. \n\nMy fried fish entree surpassed my expectations. At first it really looked like fried fish, with it's crispy and salty outside. The inside has the texture of tofu which could be troubling for some but I was blown away by the flavor instead. It seriously tasted like fish (not the texture, but still). The chef knew how to work with the ingredients. He knew how to manipulate certain aspects of a dish to really make the vegan meat taste like \"real\" meat. They also offer brown rice. \n\nThe service was nice. One of the waitress has a strong accent so it might be difficult to converse with her but she's patient and wouldn't mind repeating herself. She even gave us suggestions. \n\nThe one thing that bothered my brother was that when we paid, the hostess lady took the liberty to keep all the change. We had $6 and something cents worth of change and we planned on tipping $3 (that's 15%, I'm sure) and he can't believe that they'd assume the rest was theirs to keep. I know it's an honest mistake but just a heads up to businesses, make sure to bring the change and wait for the tip after. We promise we won't jip you."

There were only two of us, or we would have tried even more. My favorites so far ... started with BBQ \"Meat\", and LOVED both the Crispy Eggplant & General Tso Chicken.  Highly recommended!!!"

I just think they are more delicious along a big juicy slab if meat. My close friend, however, is vegan. So  we went one day after getting reflexology since we were in the area.  Delish! Now will I go so far to say that I actually thought I was eating meat? Absolutely not! However everything was prepared and seasoned properly that it satisfied that savory sensation. I will DEFINATELY go back when I am in the area again. Oh... And make sure you save room for dessert. Great Vegan ice cream too!"

            "review": "This place is such a great find! We were invited here for dinner last night by some friends. We were warned that this place has pure vegetarian menu. I love trying new food so I was all for it. I came in there with an open mind.  And to be honest, this place blew me away!\n\nLemon Chicken / Kung Pao Chicken- I could not even tell the difference. The meat felt and tasted just like chicken to me.  \n\nHouse Fried Rice - This one is really one of the best things on their menu. It has ham, chicken and shrimp. He really got the texture and the flavors of the meats down. The way he made the shrimp, it looked and tasted like real shrimp. I have to constantly remind myself that all of these are made with vegetables. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me!\n\nCrispy Eggplant - By far, this one is my favorite! It was cooked in vegetarian oyster sauce. The flavor was so good! I love how it was cooked crispy on the outside and yet soft in the middle. This dish made me change my opinion of eggplants. \n\nSalt and Pepper Veggie Rib Strips - Like everything else that we tried, this one really felt like real meat in my mouth. It was a little tough but I guess most salt and pepper dishes are made that way. Or at least the ones I've had were always cooked a little dry. It's not really a savory dish but it was still a pretty good choice. \n\nI love how Chef Kenny was able to do all these things. I give this place five star for innovation. Even if you are disappointed with some things, the flavors are still spot on. I know that most vegan dishes are made out of tofu. And you know tofu given its texture, you cannot really do much with it. The way Chef Kenny made it possible for vegans to still be able to enjoy the taste of meat is such an amazing work of art. Science and art and some kind of magic! I am totally amazed."

We were told all the good vegan food is at the Wynn but after trying this place out that statement is completely incorrect. We tried the veggie beef roll, orange chicken and crispy beef and all of the dishes were amazing. Not too far from the strip so an Uber or lyft ride isn't expensive.

Dinner is roughly $12. For someone who eats meat I can verify that this place is delicious! \n\n1. Orange chicken: most famous and it's obvious why it's famous. Taste exactly like regular phage chicken. A must try!! \n\n2. Spicy crispy eggplant: amazing flavor!!! Another popular choice. Taste and looks exactly like fries but healthier and tastier. Bit sweet and spicy and crunchy! Definitely eat it in the restaurant because it will get soggy if you take away.\n\n3. Veggie pan fried noodles: AMAZING. Very hot (temperature), crispy, excellent gravy, and tons of veggies and sit shrimps. Another must try! \n\n4. Curry tamarind fish with veggies: Nice curry taste but too sour for our liking. We ended up changing the order to regular curry and it was much better. The fish is soy and wrapped in seaweed for the \"fish\" taste. Not bad but not my favorite because of the tofu texture which throws off my taste buds. \n\n5. Kung pao chicken: Excellent flavor! The soy chicken has a wonderful flavor being marinated in the sauce. Tons of veggies too. Another must try!\n\nOverall, I will go again!"

Everything that was ordered was hot and tasted almost like it's meat-counterpart. I was very impressed. \n\nI am not vegan, but I love vegan food, vegetables, soy, etc. It was just delicious. I liked it better than regular Chinese food, it was that good! I do have to say that when I took the food home and ate it, it was not as good. So don't order what you cannot finish!\n\nLocal Specific Info: Check for a Groupon, it helps out a lot!! This place is a little on the expensive side if you want to order a lot! The Spicy Crispy Beef is bomb! and desserts are yummy~!! If you don't finish, you can take home your food!"

Though I am not a fan of crispy vegetables in a roll, I had to give them a try! Like I said, crispy veggies aren't my thing but the roll was good with the crisp and sauce and I'm happy I tried it. My sister absolutely loved these. The spring rolls had a great and light crisp outside, with a creamy steamed vegetable texture fill -- great combo and VERY flavorful.\n\nNext we ordered the Chow Mein noodles -- I'll be dreaming of this plate. The \"beef, chicken, and shrimp\" within this dish were mind blowing. Our dad isn't Vegan but absolutely enjoyed the \"meat\". \n\nThe sweet and sour chicken were crisped to perfection, I couldn't believe it! Our dad ordered a steamed broccoli plate incase he wasn't a fan of the \"meats\". Turns out that because everything was so delicious, that was his least favorite dish.\n\nService/Staff:\nKenny was a great host and our waitress was very attentive. We also had other staff members check on us but it wasn't too much nor interrupting to our meal or experience. Their approach was in great time! Kenny also brought everyone something that wasn't on the menu: Fried clam mushrooms...I could've had a whole bowl of these. Hopefully they will be on the menu as an appetizer during my next visit"

I usually get the honey walnut shrimp but is usually one of the those things you just gotta eat there or shortly after because after that the flavor and even moreso the texture of the faux shrimp becomes more prevalent. Asian style decor and ambiance is cozy with faux fountain and birds to go with your faux meat to boot! \n\nService is typically on point and welcoming. Probably my only gripe is the prices of the joint as I was spoiled with the numerous, tasty but cheap ones back home in the Bay Area. Veggie House knows that they're probably the best at their job in doing the Chinese faux meat thing here in Vegas so I reckon they feel they can command the prices they do. All in all I recommend this place for those looking to give their digestive tract a bit of a break, veggie lovers and those skeptical of the wonders of faux meat/texturized soy protein. Come with an open mind and don't knock it till you've tried it then realize you just reduced that carbon footprint of yours."

I made it a MUST GO TO on my trip. Chinese/Asian food is pretty much my favorite type of food and it sucks that most places you go to don't have many veggie friendly options. It wasn't too far from the strip either, I'd say about 10 minutes max, and on the way you start to feel like your in an Asian country because you reach Chinatown and everything is Asian themed, so cool to see. Upon walking up the sign on the door was awesome lol \"no meat allowed\" inside the establishment, I'm like \"this is my type of restaurant.\" I decided to order to-go since I had a list of other adventures to get through before the day ended. The man at the register was so nice, the wait for my food was less than 10 minutes. The place was pretty busy too which makes me so happy to see. I ordered the General Tso's chikin and it was BOMB. Perfectly sweet and the side of white rice was cooked just right. My meat loving significant other was stealing my bowl and eating some too, he really liked it which says a lot. The portion for the price was a little less than I'd like because I paid about $13 for the one entree but I would definitely pay it all over again, it's worth it. Can't wait to come back to Vegas so I can return to this place and try some of their other dishes. I also saw that the owner is opening up a plant based drive through restaurant, I will definitely be trying that too on my next visit. Try this place if your in town, it's so worth it."

Again this is due to my daughter becoming vegan , and we are here without her!!!\n\nCantonese fried fish- nearly the same taste as my favorite steamed rock cod or flounder which I always order whenever possible. \n\nOrange Chicken- who would know it wasn't with real chicken!  Most orange chicken at the other places are full of dough and filler. This is very good. \n\nSpicy eggplant!  This is great and something you don't always find at regular restaurants. \n\nChow Mein- okay I know you can get this at most normal places.

Not only did she suggest restaurants but she also suggested we meet up for dinner. Hell yeah!\n\nThe thought of vegan friendly Chinese food intrigued me and my Chinese meat eater BF. But I knew we were in good hands since Julie K., who is an absolute sweetheart btw, frequents this place enough to have a favorite waitress. We started off with some yummy Fried Veggie Dumplings (http://su.pr/2v47Ih ) while we sipped on Thai Iced Tea.\n\nThey have a very extensive menu (http://www.beyondmenu.com/25320/Las-Vegas/Veggie-House-Las-Vegas-89146.aspx?r=25320 ) I wanted to order something that I knew I couldn't order at a regular Chinese restaurant. I was craving something \"beefy\" with curry. They have \"chicken\" curry on the menu but when I asked the waitress if they have a \"beef\" curry dish, her response was \"We can make you one!\" Whoa, really!?! They will just invent dishes at your request!!! http://su.pr/1Rhxts\n\nWhen she brought it out, she informed me that this was the first time they made this dish. So we're kinda special being the first ones with a beef curry dish :) The vegan beef was mixed with all kinds of hearty veggies. It was good but I didn't enjoy it as much as our other dishes: Yee Shang Eggplant and the Salt & Pepper Fried Tofu. The eggplant dish was cooked perfectly soft and covered in a spicy sweet sauce (http://su.pr/26qrg4 ). The tofu dish had this light batter and fried perfectly crispy seasoned with just enough salt & pepper. http://su.pr/2UtvSh\n\nAt the end of our dinner, I was sad that I didn't have room for the Vegan Fried Ice Cream. Looks like I'm gonna have to venture off strip again for my next Vegas trip. This is one of those places I can definitely see myself revisiting a few more times and eventually updating this review to five stars. So many menu items I want to taste! But I'm definitely a fan and would give this place 4.5 stars if I could :)\n\nMajor thanks to Julie K. for the awesome restaurant recommendation and generously sharing her Groupon to Veggie House with us! :)"

I noticed that this place has rave reviews & the pictures looked yum so I decided to check it out today with my mother since we were in the area. This place is 100% vegan/vegetarian so two thumbs up to that!\n\nDespite the gritty location, when walking into Veggie House it was very clean & inviting. The two women who waited/served us were both very very nice & we enjoyed their service & conversation. Really nice people. Even the restroom was very clean which is always a plus!\n\nNow on to the most important stuff. The food! Omg we loved it so much. We had the spring rolls for an appetizer, fish with hot bean sauce, and hot spicy szechuan tofu which were both on the lunch special. Also when they say spicy, they mean spicy. My nose was running like mad but it was worth it. Everything was seriously good. We are really picky eaters & we had nothing bad to say about the place. I see myself coming back again & again & again lol! I want to try everything on the menu eventually!!!! Can't wait to come back in the future because every time someone elses order was delivered to their table I couldn't help but notice how delicious everyone elses food also looked!!!\n\nReally happy to have found this place & would definitely recommend to anyone!!!"

            "review": "i'm kind of on the fence about this place.  While the food was generally tasty, I'm wondering exactly how much healthier it is here vs eating at any other \"regular\" chinese joint that serves meat.  I mean the food was for the most part tasty, but the sauces it was covered in were painfully sweet, sorry but there is just no way you could call this \"healthy\" eating which is one of the reasons to go vegetarian, right?  I'm not lying when I say I felt my health was worse after eating here.\n\nCase in point...we ordered 3 dishes, Lettuce wraps, Orange \"chicken\", and General tzo's \"chicken\".  So for the \"chicken\" dishes, I'm not really sure what the faux chicken was made up of, maybe tofu? but whatever it was, it was covered in a thick batter (thicker than a normal chinese restaurant) and deep fried, then buried in a sauce that was basically liquid candy.  I cut a couple pieces in half and it was more than 50% batter, that can't be healthy.  The lettuce wraps were probably the healthiest of the 3 dishes and also the tastiest. The wraps, along with the side of rice, a mix of brown / wild rice, were the high points of the meal.\n\nOne other good thing that stood out was the service.  The servers were on it, refilling waters quickly and checking on us multiple times to make sure everything was O.K.. The restaurant itself was also very clean and inviting.  There is ample parking in the shopping complex and there's also a big asian market downstairs.  I doubt I'll be back to the Veggie House but I'll surely be back to the asian market."

When it was all said and done they stacked all of our plates at the table and practically kicked us out. Not once did we complain about their behavior and we still left a decent tip. I mean, tbh, it was comical. \n\nI have worked in restaurants my whole life and I have never had a more unwelcome experience. Needless to say, we won't be back. For everyone else, be sure to get there an hour before closing because they have zero respect for their patrons and give no leeway.\n\nThe food was just okay and the decor was dated and well used.

Servings are large enough to share, so I could see myself bringing family and friends here. The only thing I wish was that more vegetables were on my plate. The orange chicken came with slices of mandarins which was complemented the faux meat but apart from chicken and rice, I didn't really have a balanced meal of proteins, carbs, and vegetables. (Some might not care, but when I go out to eat, I like to have as much of a balanced meal as possible.) I'm sure I could've ordered a vegetable dish, but that's just me being nit-picky. Anyway, the food was amazing. My boyfriend is a picky eater and even he scraped up the last of his dish. The orange chicken has a complexity that finishes delightfully and not like that vinegar-y overpowering stuff they have at other chain restaurants.\n\nAtmosphere: Is kitschy charming. There's a faux gazebo and garden awnings on top of booths. There's also a bird's nest that chirps every once in a while. That was funny to try and figure out. \n\nService: Two women checked on us at the appropriate times. I asked for chili sauce to go with my meal and they obliged no problem. \n\nOverall, I'm glad Las Vegas has a good vegetarian option that's meat-eater/picky-eater friendly. I'm excited to go back and try every single one of their dishes."

If you're a starter and trying to go for an all vegan/vegetarian diet you should probably go here, their food isn't bland and tasteless like most vegetarian/vegan place. They make actual Chinese dishes but every single ingredient on the plate is all vegetarian ESP the meat. Their house crispy pan fried noodle is very delicious (maybe a little oily) but it tastes almost exact to the non veggies. The Tom yum soup is pretty good too, alongside with the Buddha delight yum! Oh and as appetizer I always order the turmeric salad. At first the taste was a little strange but now that I'm used to it, it's pretty addicting!! The food always makes me feel more energetic after I leave and the service is always so fast and the waiters/waitresses are very friendly. This place is totally worth the try! If you're a vegan or vegetarian and looking for a good place to eat (since there's like not that many good vegetarian places around) I would DEFINITELY recommend this veggie house go and try it if you haven't! Even if you're not vegetarian and you want to try some vegetarian food you can still go try it! It's pretty bomb. You won't regret it."

I needed an excuse to check out this newly-opened all vegetarian/vegan restaurant so when I was hungry the following Saturday night, we made the drive down there.  \n\nWe were greeted with a sample of the crispy beef from the chef.  It was great, lighty crisp, tossed in a sweet & savory sauce, sprinkled with crushed peanuts.  I ordered the 2 item cold dish combo for an appetizer and selected the BBQ Meat and the Bitter Melon Salad.  I asked what the bitter melon was before ordering and was told that it was a squash that was mildly bitter.  The BBQ Meat can be passed off as the BBQ Pork I remember eating as a little kid, red on the outside and grey on the inside.  The Bitter Melon was terrible.  Not that it was prepared yucky, it is just not a vegetable we could eat.\n\nEntrees were General Tzo Chicken, Szechuan Shrimp and House Chow Fun.  The General Tzo Chicken is 5 stars!  Fried crispy on the outside but chewy in texture on the inside.  Tossed in a sweet and spicy sticky sauce, perfect for clinging to the rice.  The Szechuan Shrimp sauce had a good flavor and it really did look like shrimp, the taste and \"shrimpy flavor\" was a little too much for me.  I'm glad I tried it, and I'm sure that it is a favorite of shrimp lovers but I can't say that I will order it again.  The Chow Fun was great too.  The vegetables were stir fried in a super hot wok that gave them that smokey burnt flavor on the edges and perfectly cooks them to a crisp tender.  \n\nThe service was fast, friendly and attentive.  When we got the check, the order was taken in Chinese so I had to stare at the symbols for 10 minutes."

The food here is really great, the service is fast and the entire staff is incredibly friendly and nice. The first time I ever went here the menu was a bit overwhelming and I didn't know what to choose but one of the servers was very open to make recommendations and I finally went with the Crispy Spicy Eggplant. This dish is a must try and I highly recommend it! I've dined here about 10 times and each time I try to get something different but I tend to always gravitate back to the CS Eggplant. As a vegan, this place was a god-send as it's not easy to find somewhere that has a variety of vegan dishes to choose from, and delicious ones at that. I've also brought my family here a few times and even though they are meat-eaters they still really enjoyed this place. Something else that I love about Veggie House is the portion size of all of their dishes. They really do give you a great sized portion that will fill you up and you may even have leftovers (if you can manage to get yourself to stop eating their delicious food, which is unlikely). Each time I'm in Vegas I have to go to Veggie House at least a couple times during my visit. I can't wait to be back in town this summer so I can go to one of my favorite restaurants and get my Crispy Spicy Eggplant fix."

I do not care for white rice, so the brown rice that came with the dish worked well. The best , yet unexpected part of the dish were the nuts on top!

Otherwise, it'll be a bust. My first visit was fabulous. I ordered the bean curd with bamboo flowers and vegetables and also got to sampled the lemongrass and mushrooms dish. They were both excellent!\n\nOn my second visit, I asked for the hot and spicy Szechuan tofu. Personally I don't like non-fried tofu so I made sure to ask if the tofu in this dish is fried. There's definitely a language barrier between me and the server as she nodded her head and said yes to my question. When the dish arrived, it was a mass of white and mushy tofu cubes in a brown sauce. Clearly the tofu was cooked, not fried. After I clarified that I wanted it fried, the dish turned out okay. There wasn't any vegetables in this dish, just tofu in a sauce. Hence, this dish was as boring as it can be. Pass.\n\nMy friends all enjoyed their food. One ordered the beef and broccoli and the other ordered the lemon chicken. We're probably coming back to try other items."

The restaurant is very clean, well lit, and nicely decorated.

I went there three days in a row out of my five day vacation and would have gone more if my vacation was any longer.  \nEvery item I tried, I loved,  from the crispy eggplant to the Buddha delight.  My mouth is watering just thinking about dining there again.  Even my non vegan date loved the food,  maybe even more than I did!   Also the mock meat dishes are so convincing, I am pretty sure you can bring a meat eater there and they wouldn't be the wiser.

I also really enjoy the bbq veggie meat from the apps list. It looks like that red bbq pork. \n\nIt also delighted my meat-eating family members who are normally not so receptive to veg food.

They use rice flour, tofu and other soy based products, but I doubt you'd be able to tell you weren't eating chicken!! This was first time I enjoyed these dishes in over a year. Was so good that I went back the very next day. Lettuce Wrap appetizer was also amazing! The staff is also great! They will take the time to speak with you about your diet restrictions and ensure that was you've ordered is prepared as desired."

It is loaded with veggies and very good faux chicken.  It is a yellow curry, more like an indian yellow curry than a thai curry.  if you are sensitive to spicy foods it might be a bit much, but for me it was just the right amount of heat.  The Brown rice here is the best brown rice ive ever had...idk what other rices they use but its got a few dif grains in it that all come together so perfectly.  Tofu soup that comes with the lunch special is simple but flavorful.  For $8 it is a great value...I brought half my plate home! \n\nOther dishes I have tried: \n*general tzos chicken: 5 stars (tastes EXACTLY like \"regular\" general tzos\n*roti with curry: 5 stars\n*crispy spicy eggplant: 3 stars (this is a highly praised dish, but I personally didn't like it as much as some people seem to. I think It is pretty good as a side, just not extraordinary as a main dish)\n*spicy crispy beef: 3 stars. (Another highly praised dish, but again not one of my faves. Not very convincing \"beef\"...to thin and crispy...reminded me almost like fried pork skins...but not as hard/crispy as pork skin so just kind of a confusing texture for me.  It was flavorful, and would be amazing on a bahn mi!\n*orange chicken: 2 stars. (Tasted more like sweet and sour than orange. Very vinegary sauce)\n*sweet and sour pork: 3 stars. (Loved the \"pork\" texture)\n*fried dumplings: 3 stars (would have been 5 stars, but the ones i got were overdone.  Very tasty inside tho)\n*shrimp and broccoli: 4 stars (One of the \"plainer\" dishes.  No overly rich sauces, but it still has good flavor to it. it tastes very similar to shrimp with broccoli from a regular Chinese place.\n\nA lot of the dishes here would fool meat eaters.   It is a great place for vegans and omnis to eat together. Can't wait for the ched to open his fast food restaurant to open in sept!!! (Featuring burgers and fish tacos and milkshakes and more!)"

We both sat there wondering how they got away with so little oil while making it crisp and still fluffy inside The yellow curry that came with was pretty decent as well.\n\nCrispy Beef - this was hard to tell this was soy beef aside it from not having any kind of strong beefy flavor. They know how to fry up something crispy here as the sauce never made the crisp outside sog AT ALL and it was not a greasy dish either. I wish every Chinese restaurant knew the Veggie House secret.\n\n5 Vegetable Delight - this was subtle, but solid vegetables. The sauce is a light soy and ginger and it had lotus root, mustard, mushrooms (black fungus and shiitake), snap peas, carrots and cashews. \n\nWe ate everything up but didn't feel overly stuffed or get that \"itis\" you get when you just eat some filling, fatty, salty stuff. Definitely not feel guilty food at all. \n\nI'm glad there is a place like this around. My own caveat is for a place that is \"Veggie House\" there wasn't many JUST vegetable dishes there, but I digress. I'm just not keen on fake meats, but that beef was good. \n\nService here is pretty good. Checking on us and drinks were refilled and didn't stay empty very long which is much appreciated on a hot summer day. \n\nMust come if you're vegetarian/ vegan , definitely worthy even if you're not. The uncommon meat substitutes are definitely a foodie adventure in their own right."

            "review": "We love veggie house! I have now visited this place at least 5 times and they have never failed. Some dishes in my opinion, are better than others, but I think the trick is figuring out what you like. Veggie house is a very cute restaurant with a small pond, gazebo, and twinkle lights all in one place. The servers are always very sweet and have not trouble understanding English. They are also patient when my friends and I roll in with 5-7 children as well as accomodating to their needs (forks, smaller water cups, removal of hot tea glasses, etc). Now, let's get to the good stuff.\n\nThe spicy crispy eggplant is seriously as good as everyone says. They're like slightly more fiberous (and nutritionally rich) variation of french fries tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce. They are crispy and the flavors are out of this world. We get this every time, but I recommend that this is not ordered to go as they will obviously lose their crisp texture. We get this as an appetizer because everyone just grabs heaping loads onto their plate and is a fantastic appetite-teaser. Their roti with chicken curry is also amazing! We tried it for the first time two days ago and had to put in a second order because the kids couldn't get enough. Even though I make roti (the frozen variation) at home, it had nothing on the light and puffed up roti that was served with that perfect curry. \n\nMy favorite entree is probably the eggplant with tofu because it has thai basil in it! I love basil, so I am unfairly biased to any dish that has basil in it, but this dish is fantastic. The tofu in it is somehow better than in other dishes. A definite winner. Another awesome dish is the braised tofu with veggies because of the HUGE assortment of veggies that come with it. Everything from bok choy, to snap peas, to mushrooms can all be found alongside the braised tofu. My kids of course love the chow fun because what kid doesn't love noodles? The texture and the abundance of veggies is what I dream of from other restaurants. \n\nWhile I do cook with a lot of \"fake meat\" at home, I am not a fan of some of the fake meat items from here. Even my husband, who loves his animal products suggests that we go sans-fake-meat because he prefers the vegetable dishes here. The texture of some of the chicken (orange chicken, simmering beef plate) dishes are very strange. They're made from a chinese vegetable with a lot of different layers and are kind of tough and chewy compared to real chicken, but the chicken inside the curry chicken was nothing like this. I don't know how they determine which type of \"fake meat\" to use for which dish, but I say try them all and see what you like. \n\nLastly, they have vegan ice cream here and the cherry chocolate chip is on point!! My friends ordered the cherry chip while I got the green tea, and I was envious after I tried theirs that I was stuck with the green tea. Don't pass up the vegan ice cream, or the 10% Yelp check-in offer that they're currently offering. Come one come all for those that are looking to add a little extra veggies to their diet. I promise they'll come in a tasty way."

It really is hard to believe some of the items aren't animal products but it makes me so in revolt happy that they are all 100% vegan. Our server did inform us that they use eggs upon request only, which was comforting further. I love this place because you can't deny that they thoroughly believe in being vegan and embrace it in their dishes better than any place I've been to yet."

The space has a Zen vibe with a fountain, plants and chimes. Wait staff were super friendly and helpful. \n\nWe shared three dishes family style: the much lauded (and rightfully so) crispy, addictive eggplant, ma pao tofu (I'm a huge fan of soft tofu, but I think it needed spice) and curry \"fish\" (we'd ordered black bean but ate it anyway) Here is where the former vegan in me (sooo obnoxious as a Cal undergrad that I would not ingest honey \"because bees worked to make it\" thank goodness I got over myself!) is not a big fan of faux meats, but they seem to be the norm. The \"fish\" had a great sauce with tamarind kick, but texture was somewhat of an issue for all of us. Included in the price was brown (!) rice and a vegetable consomm\u00e9 which was soothing but a little bland. \n\nFor 8$ each, inclusive of tax and tip, we ate well and enjoyed the experience.  Definitely worth another visit and I believe even carnivores will enjoy the food as the preparation shows attention to detail and commitment to vegetarian/vegan eats. 8 is also my favorite & lucky number, so I love how they open at 11:38AM according to front door :))"

After I bought the groupon I started to think about what I can expect and I came on here to get a heads up on the menu, decor stuff like that but I still retained an open mind so that I could enjoy the experience and write this review. Everyone said the food and atmosphere was great and they didn't lie. It was a little jewel in china town above a strip mall, you would walk right by it if you weren't looking for it and I liked that. Upon entering the restaurant I noticed how light the restaurant felt, it gave you that feel good vibe, there was no wait time and the hostess was friendly. The restaurant was clean and the sound of running water which was coming from the decor was delightful and calming. A waitress came to our table right away and asked if we had ever been there before, you could tell that she cared about the reputation of the restaurant and the quality of our experience, I loved that. After I said no she proceeded to tell me about the specials and what she would recommend and even asked me what my taste were (at this point it was groupon be damned and I was going to pay full price for the food and experience). I ordered the roti for the appetizer and for dinner I ordered the seaweed steam with basil and my sister had the fried eggplant. With the waitress gone we were able to soak up the ambiance of the restaurant , 5 mins after that appetizers came and 20 mins after that the dishes were on the table. At first bite I was in love with my dish, it was really spicy just like I like and it had a bold flavor (I thought that the seaweed would have a fishy off putting taste to it but it didn't). It had exactly the flavors I wanted and was just different enough to add to  my overall experience. My sister's experience was slightly different, she is a very picky eater since birth and found the eggplant too sweet for her liking but after urging her to put some soy sauce on it (soy sauce has a lot of sodium so I knew it would balance out the sweetness) she was liking her dish too. So desert was next up I ordered the green tea ice cream and she had the cherry ice cream, my ice cream was more of a palate cleanser and seeing as how I love tons of sugar and like I said I wanted something different it was good. My sister's experience of her desert was 4 thumbs up and she would go back just to get the ice cream (being that the place is like 2 hours away from where we live by bus that's saying something). I would recommend veggie house to anyone that lives or visits Vegas, this place really made my day."

Kung Pao Chicken, General Tso's Chicken and Spicy Crispy Beef with Broccoli are a must. Turmeric Salad and Crispy Spicy Eggplant are also good. Lunch specials are awesome with a lot of food for the price. I always get three lunch specials(take-out) which is way cheaper, and then you have amazing veggie meat for days. Just don't forget to ask for extra soy sauce packets. Rice without soy sauce or Braggs is pretty rough.\nNote: Parking lot is a little tight, and you have to walk up the stairs to get to the front entrance.\n*Lunch time can get pretty crazy in there, so if you're picking up, you might have to peek your head in the seating area and flag them down. Otherwise, you might be waiting awhile.\n*FYI, the owner just opened up another plant based restaurant, Vegeway, which specializes in awesome burgers, sandwiches, vegan milkshakes, etc. And the coolest part, there's a drive thru! Aw man, how long I've been waiting for something like this to exist."

The food is pretty good especially the items on the specials. They are seasoned amazingly well. The one dish that turned out less than desirable was the Buddah's Delight. It was quite plain and the veggies a little over cooked.\n\nThe proprietor is very welcoming and brings samples around for tasting so you can see all the other delicious items you could be eating.

He loved the coconut juice he ordered!\n\nThe chef came out to explain some of the dishes to my boyfriend because he had a hard time understanding how veggie meat is a thing, which was nice. The crispy beef is really nice and crispy with a nice mild heat, the oyster mushrooms were inhaled and all those veggies were just the thing to get me feeling a lot better. Food came with small servings of white rice (but you can pick brown) and we did not get through it all. If you are not much of an eater a portion is enough per person. \n\nI ordered the strawberry cheesecake for dessert and was pleasantly surprised to see it was a douhua style confection.

Honestly, you put their dishes next to the real thing and do a blind taste test and you'd certainly have trouble.  I only tried a few dishes but each was very good.  I had to try the kung pao chicken as I hear many people really enjoy that.  I also wanted tot try to the vegan bbq appetizer as I'm a big char siu fan.  To begin, the kung pao was your typical dish with zucchini, peanuts, peppers, and their rendition of chicken.  I thought it could have had more spice, but overall the portion size was solid and the dish had a good taste.  The bbq pork didn't quite have the strong tast of a char siu, but it was pretty close, especially in Vegas where it's very hard to find a quality bbq Chinese pork.  The prices were maybe a $1 or $2 higher than other take out Chinese, but the uniqueness and selection was great and I believe worth the extra few bucks.  They have a vegan burger joint opening up as well, so I will surely come back to Veggie House and try their beef and fish dishes and also try Vegeway when it opens in late September 2016."

All the dishes were full of flavor and every morsel was better than the last. I don't know how Chef Kenny does it, but the chicken tastes just like chicken, it's uncanny! The only constructive criticism I would give is that they invest in a soda dispenser, instead of soda cans. Also, the decorations are a bit cheesy and old. It would be more appealing if they went more modern, simple, and cozy. But that has no effect on the food and service, which is very exceptional in all aspects!

We've tried a lot of dishes there in addition, and have enjoyed them all: the sizzling vegetable plates, the orange \"beef\", and different \"shrimp\" dishes (but eat the \"shrimp\" while its hot and fresh; the texture doesn't fare well from being taken home and put into the refrigerator). And you must try to the roti canai (next to frybread, the best thing ever done with wheat flour!), with vegan curry sauce to dip it in.

There are good places, yes but this place definitely will trick a carnivore into thinking they just had some beef right off of the hibachi. When I first tried it, I ordered orange beef to go and when I got home, I opened the box and was confused because it looked like beef so I stared at it for a while just to make sure. After much hesitation, I bit a piece of it and spit it right back out before I was so certain I had eaten beef. I would have been sick after not eating red meat in years. I had to look online about this place again just to be sure and was absolutely amazed. My boyfriend is not a vegetarian and took a bite out of my food out of complete curiosity and thought the same as I did. After explaining it was all soy product, he was completely surprised and now wants to go eat with me. I'm not trying to turn him into a vegan but it is nice to go to a restaurant that we both can enjoy. I did not give 5 stars however because I wasn't impressed with the service.

Nope, not here.\n\nThe walnut shrimp and the sesame chicken could've fooled a carnivore performing a blind taste test! Their textures were deceptively like their naturally occurring animal counterparts. It probably helped these dishes to fry these meatless morsels in a light batter. The crispy spicy eggplant was cut into perfectly-sized strips and the sauce was spot on. Brown rice is also offered as an option, which is different from most Asian establishments.\n\nAs fans of roast duck from Chinese restaurants, my friends and I were intrigued by the pineapple duck and ordered it. Duck is difficult to replicate because of its gamey flavor and texture, so I wasn't expecting much. At first glance, it looked similar; however, at first bite, it was akin to fried tofu that was squished down. In the end, I was mostly put off by the sauce.\n\nThe establishment itself is nice and clean with very attentive service. The dishes are well-priced, since my group of four paid about $13 each (including tax and tip). I'd like to try their lunch specials and non-fried dishes too!

So don't miss it (11:30AM-3:00PM). We ordered general tzao chicken and crispy spicy eggplant, and the food was delivered quickly! \n\nThe food is really good, I swear the meatless meat is even better than actual meat.

China town in itself is unique off the strip experience and it really does feel like you're in Asia. To find the restaurant, you need to walk up stairs to the second level of the plaza (there is also an elevator). I've been to Veggie House twice. The first time I didn't like it so much and I ate very little because the flavor of the food was too meat-like (but maybe that's a compliment to the chef for people who like the flavor of meat - he got it right on). The second time I ate there was much better. I went with friends and was able to try a bit of everything because we ordered a bunch of food to share. I recommend the roti, chicken lettuce wraps, kung pao chicken, and their meatballs in that order. I also found a coupon on groupon so I plan to go back and see if there's anything else I might like. Overall it's worth a visit for it's uniqueness and wide variety of vegetarian/vegan options (where else in the world are you going to find vegetarian geese on a menu!?)."

I may still be traumatized from some vegetarian potluck gone-bad in my childhood.\n\nThis place is different. It's amazing. Come here.\n\nEverything I have tried here has been excellent. Here are my favorites:\n\nCrispy Eggplant 5/5\nI checked in with yelp and decided we needed to try this even though we were here for dessert. Very happy I did. Crispy fried goodness with a delicious sauce, this dish highly recommended for good reason. Get it.\n\nCrispy Oyster Mushrooms 5/5\nIt's hard to describe how good this dish is, it's just ridiculous. Deep fried crispy mushrooms drenched in a thick, rich lemongrass sauce and tossed with saut\u00e9ed veggies. Be warned, this is a dish you will remember for a long time and probably have serious cravings for. If you try this while visiting Vegas, you may find yourself needing to come back here just to get more.\n\nVanilla vegan Ice Cream 5/5\nCreamy. Vanilla. Perfect level of sweetness. Yummy.\n\nCherry Chocolate Chip Ice Cream  & Sticky Rice 5/5\nWOW. One of the best desserts I have had in a long time, vegan or otherwise. They make this with real black cherries and chunks of dark chocolate. The sticky rice is a must, it's served hot and the ice cream starts melting over it. This one was so good we had to order a second round before we left.\n\nService here was super friendly and the decor is nice, everything looks very clean.\n\nThey currently have a yelp special for 10% off dinner items, check in here and use it.\n\nEasy 5 stars."

So we did! \nThe server was so nice and remembered Hunnie Bunnie from the previous day. \nWe ordered a roll, noodles, fried rice, tofu with veggies... EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS and the \"fake meat\" was freaking awesome! Hunnie Bunnie doesn't usually like the fake stuff but it doesn't have an offensive taste here and it really is damn good! You wouldnt even know everything here was vegan if you were in a blind taste test! \nEVERYONE should try this place out! It's phenomenal!! VEGAN LIFE!!!!!!"

We also had fried eggplant appetizer that was great and crunchy and full of flavor.  We also ordered our favorite Thai ice tea which was made with soymilk and was much less sweet than we get at our local thai restaurant. We ordered the buns as a side, and it was not what we expected.. (we thought steamed buns but it was more of a harder bread, I would not order it again). I also liked the appetizer soup, it had great flavor and many vegetables. If you are vegetarian or like a flavorful light lunch, I would highly recommend this place."

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND going out of the beaten path and trying Veggie House!  \n\nThis is specifically Vegetarian Chinese Food! It's about eating chinese food made out of pressed tofu - you get all the flavors and textures of the dish but there's NO MEAT!  It's not about just eating veggies made different ways - it's really about enjoying chinese classics without the meat!!\n\nWe had the Kung Pao Chicken and I tell you - it was flavorful - tasted JUST like Kung Pao Chicken I grew up eating in SF Chinatown! It looked and tasted like chicken but after careful dissection - it was pressed tofu! It was SO GOOD!!!  The table next to us had the Orange Chicken - it looked JUST like orange chicken and they way they gobbled it up - I believe they were happy with it....\n\nOur second dish was the crispy spicy eggplant - where they slice up the eggplant like french fries - fry it up with a mild spicy sauce - so it's crispy, light and SO GOOD!  I honestly will make this place our MUST GO TO place everything we come to Vegas!!! it's a local hangout and it's AWESOME. I wish we could've tried more dishes - will just have to invite more people so we can try more dishes!!\n\nI haven't had great vegetarian chinese food since I went to Hong Kong 30 years ago! It brought back those fond memories!  But at least this place is in the same continent for me!! :)"

There are so many Asian Veg places where we're from that when in Vegas, it's probably the last cuisine that I'm looking to eat.\n\nWhile we have a \"house of veggies\" (two, I believe) in The Bay Area, it's nothing like what they have here in Vegas. Bay Area Vegetarian House = Mostly Vietnamese style food, served with a side of Supreme Master aura. LV Veggie House = Mostly Chinese inspired dishes, served with a Buddhist aura in a tranquil environment, just a short drive from the bustling activity of The Strip.\n\nThey really thought out every nook and cranny of the details to their interior decorations. It's nothing fancy, some of it kinda cheesy, yet it all flows together so naturally. I got a kick out of listening to the water fall from the top of the corrugated plastic roof of one of the gazebos.\n\nThe waitresses were great. One gal even rearranged our table in a fit of feng shui (or OCD). It's good that they're easy to talk to since the menu descriptions were quite vague or nonexistent at all.\n\nI'm a fan of the Genreral Tso, so that is one of the first things we ordered. Theirs was done as well as any that I've had. Same with the Orange Chicknon. Crispy with a nice tangy sauce. The General coulda been spicier but that's what the house made chili sauce is for.\n\nThe dish that truly stood out for me was the Pan Fried Noodle. My coworkers often order this when we go out to eat at non-veg restaurants. After one bite, I can see why. The noodles were crunchy, while the flavorful, thick sauce moistened things up and added an extra layer of flavor.\n\nThey have a Curry Roti that was delicious as well. It reminds me of the light, flaky roti that I used to love before I returned to being Vegan. Get two orders of this or you'll be fighting over who gets the last bite.\n\nEven though we were stuffed, my babygirl was drooling over the dessert menu. We went with the fried 'naner and ice cream. So good! They had several ice cream flavors but they were out of most of them so we went with classic vanilla.\n\nYou can tell that Chef Kenny puts a lot of love into his food. He'll come out to greet the dinner guests and chat for a bit before disappearing into the kitchen. He just wants to be sure everyone is enjoying the food.\n\nI could spend my entire Vegas vacation in Chinatown. Partly because of Veggie House. They make being Vegan in Vegas a breeze. They do have egg in some items, but if you tell the waitresses that you're Vegan, you'll have no worries. \n  \nFor a more complete rundown of all the dishes that we ordered, see this Hot Stuff's review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/veggie-house-las-vegas-4?hrid=t4jLm0i_cyZUwP4KQlTzbQ"

I had no idea that this place is primarily Chinese influenced, except for the twist that it's vegan.\n\nYou can find the eatery tucked in the corner on the second floor of the original SF Market shopping plaza.  While going to the bathroom, I noticed that there is parking out back that offers easy access to the restaurant via a ramp from the side of the building.\n\nPractically everything here resembles most Chinese cuisines, except for the fact that there is no meat!  There is even a sign saying that they'll chop you head off if you come in with a slim jim or something of the sort...well maybe not that radical, but something to that affect.  Yet, the vegan faux meats is unparalleled.  I am guessing that most of it is derived from soy/tofu, but one cannot be sure.  Chef Kenny offers pineapple duck, general tso's chicken, and even seafood dishes, all ingredients are made with meatless plant proteins, natural spices, seasonings and even organic. No MSG, preservatives, or food coloring are added as well.\n\nWe started with the crab and shark fin soup (delish) and had the spicy beef with brocoli with curry mushroom plate.  Its amazing how closely the faux meat resembles real meat and like to think frying the ingredients has a lot to adding to the texture.  I can't wait to try some of the other dishes that were on rotation digitally on the flat screen TV's in the dining area.  Each time i peeked up, I say something else I wanted to try in the future.\n\nThe staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  There were only two servers and the place is pretty petite, but handled well on the floor.  The place is designed with several cabana themes and a small pond inside.  Nothing flashy and colors were neutral and not surprising.  Maybe a little interior decorating wouldn't hurt.  The place was clean and very well kept to say the least.  Even Chef Kenny was roaming around greeting guests, this says a lot.\n\nI thought that the dishes would be pricier given that it was a vegan joint, but not the case at all.  Everything is reasonably priced and competitive with similar (non vegan) dishes alike.  Although, because the place is small and popular, there could be a slight wait.  \n\nOverall, very good place and a great addition for those who are either vegan or vegetarian."

I brought a friend (meat lover) and she said that if she could eat this everyday, then she could easily become a vegetarian. A lot of the food is nothing like you would ever experience before and you won't find it at any local grocery store. A lot of the food inspirations were better than the food that inspired them.\n\nI have tried everything from the mixture seafood to their stir fried beef. It is hard to pick one that a loved more, but the most recent one I loved was their pineapple duck. The texture of the food is amazingly close to the real thing, or so my meat eater friends have told me, and the sauce was perfect. It came with it covered in sauce and surrounded with pineapples. The look of it would remind you the look of real duck at the regular restaurant. All this and no cruelty for a low price!\n\nTheir fish to me is better than the animal version. Texture is amazingly close, but better in its own way. The taste is dead on, but no nasty mercury after taste. My uncle told me it does not taste like any specific fish, but it does taste like fish. My uncle, by the way, loves fish to death and he enjoyed the fish there too. Their sushi as an appetizer is really good also, or it could be a meal.\n\nTheir desserts are very interesting and they even have vegan options. I have had the bean cake topped with green tea ice cream. Presentation is as cool as the ice cream and the taste was top notch. Definitely try that if you ever go.\n\nOverall, I love the place, its easily one of my favorite vegetarian/vegan spots. The service is incredible and everyone is super nice. The decor is really cool and they have done a lot with the place. It is really relaxing and the next time your there, look for the animatronic birds in the corner over the pond, they chirp."

However, we really enjoyed our meal. Everything is vegetarian. We ordered the eggplant and crispy \"beef\" lunch specials and everything was fantastic. The eggplant was cooked super well. The crispy \"beef\" was very crispy and had a good flavor, but it didn't taste like meat to me, which is a plus. However, the roti with curry sauce was the highlight of our meal and tasted delicious. \n\nWe had a groupon, which we weren't allowed to use with the lunch special and we had forgotten the details of the groupon because we have so many. The waitress was able to accommodate us by switching  everything from lunch special to full prices. If we had known this, we might have ordered other things. We realize that not knowing the terms of our groupon was our fault, but it would have been nice for the waitress to check if we were using one when she took our order. Hopefully they will do this for future patrons."

The only problem was it was cut in 5 pieces and I thought my husband was going to stab my hand when I went for the 3rd piece.  Brown rice is the usual, not extra or poorly cooked.  We loved the eggplant and the soft and egg tofu. \n\n\nCan I just add that we have since tried the Mongolian beef which was very tasty and the spicy scallop which was outstanding. You have to try this even if you are not vegan. We do go here at least twice a month. We have the oyster mushroom in Lemon Grass sauce every time.\n\nWe have been back with our favorite vegan friend and she ordered the Orange Chicken. She loved it. I got to try it. It was so much better than Panda or the like. And it wasn't chicken. It tasted like real oranges!!"

The Cilantro Salad is surprisingly addictive.  All of the \"fish\" dishes are exceptional, especially the smoked fish.  The \"chicken\" dishes have spot-on flavor and texture.  The \"scallop\" dish is very good.  Everything that we've tried has been really, really enjoyable but the ones I mentioned here are the ones that I would order first everytime I go, and then I add a couple of new dishes I haven't had before as well.  Their cherry chocolate chip \"ice cream\" is the perfect way to end a meal that leaves you full and in disbelief that everything you just ate was completely vegan.  Chef Kenny is the consummate host as well, and he knows most of his customers.  The old school hospitality by him the great attitude from his service staff make a visit a joy."

They refilled drinks promptly, they took requests for sharing plates and napkins quickly. It truly was a great first experience.\n\nI've heard great things about \"fake meat\". I've heard that their are delicious fried chicken sandwiches at Veggie places that rival the real thing.\n\nI willingly tried out veggie house for lunch with two friends.\n\nThey have a large menu of vegan and vegetarian dishes. Many of them feature tofu, veggies, and \"fake meat\". Sorry I can't figure out a better sounding phrase.\n\nAnyways their lunch special comes with soup, brown or white rice, and an entree. I don't remember the price but the lunch portions of the items were big! I want to say it was $7-$8 for their lunch special.\n\nBetween the here of us we had beef and broccoli, Kung pao beef, and their famous crispy beef.\n\nAll of the entrees were served with their traditional veggies. Like the Kung pao had water chestnuts, onions, ect,\n\nThe veggies on my beef and broccoli were a large portion. All of their ingredients are fresh. \n\nAnd let me get to the meat. Upon first bite it truly is a great substitute to meat. It really does taste relatively close to the real thing. They have the texture right. All of the dishes had the same traditional flavors you'd expect. The crispy beef was the least like beef IMO since it is fried it tasted more like fried batter. It was still tasty. Their brown rice was cooked perfectly. The soup had a very mild flavor. It was like a veggie broth.\n\nLast we had a vegan pumpkin cheesecake. It was a good ending to the meal. It was light, sweet, and pumpkiny. I still prefer regular cheesecake.\n\nAm I a convert? No. It did make me rethink all the salt and meat I eat. Will I come back here and was the food good? Yes! \n\nThis is a five star restaurant. Good service, good food quality, unique, good prices, clean."

Previous reviews mention that it is a 'vegan' restaurant and I want to clarify that since they use eggs, including some of the noodles, it is a vegetarian restaurant, but there is no shortage of options to choose if you so desire a vegan meal. \n\nWe ordered the crispy wanton appetizer, veggie house soup, crispy beef, crispy scallop, and the fried rice with egg. \n\nThe filling in the wonton was sort of a veggie mash that was bland and the wonton wrapper was thick and rather starchy. You definitely needed to dip it in the sweet sauce that accompanied the dish. \n\nThe soup was a mild cabbage broth with celery, bits of carrot, fennel, and tofu cubes. I found myself adding more and more white pepper to season it. I appreciate low sodium in dishes, but it still should be seasoned well to avoid a blah blandness. \n\nThe crispy beef was pretty tasty. You have to eat it right away or the sauce gooeys the crispyness into mush. The crushed peanuts on top added a nice texture. The broccoli that was served along side the dish was just steamed and a bit on the cool side when it reached our table. \n\nThe crispy spicy scallops had a sweet in spicy sauce that had red bell peppers and thinly sliced Persian cucumbers. The scallops were good for me but my partner couldn't get over the chewy texture. They use giant oyster mushroom stems to make the scallops. There was definitely a taste of mushroom. Not the dish for you if you don't like mushrooms. \n\nThe fried rice had raisins, pineapple, peas, egg, veggie ham, and veggie crab. The rice was typical fried rice in flavor with a small note of sweetness from the raisins and pineapple. The veggie ham pieces were so small, you didn't even notice them. The veggie crab had the consistency of little gelatinous snot balls and did nothing for the dish. I picked them out. \n\nThe service was great. Our server was overly happy and constantly smiling and even brought our toddler a free bowl of steamed rice.\n The ice tea is worth noting. They brew it there using red tea leaves. It was crisp and refreshing and we prob had 5 refills. The green tea is not loose leaves but is in a tea bag added to your tea pot. \n\nI would not go out of my way to come back, but if I was in close proximity, and hungry, and it was lunch time so I could get the $6.50 lunch special, then I'd prob pop in for more of that crispy beef.\n\nSo 2 stars for the food and an extra for our friendly server."

We were hungry after the drive from SD and I knew once we parked our car or the weekend we would not be getting into it until we left.  I am not use to having so many choices as a vegetarian, but everything on the menu was veggie friendly.  They had so many veggie meat alternatives, it was insane.  We had the crispy beef and the pad thai and were pleased with both.  If you are a vegetarian in Vegas you should totally check this place out."

The atmosphere is very clean, green and zen like. \n\nService was great! The older Asian ladies were all very nice and even wrapped up our leftovers for us! \n\nHot and Sour soup (bowl)- was nice and spicy but was a bit bland..

Tastes pretty much just like the real thing!!!\nSizzling \"Chicken\" and Veggies- This was my fav dish of the day. Bell peppers, onions, mushrooms made the dish especially yummy!\nBrown Rice: At no extra charge and is included with entrees!!!\n\nThe fake meat looked just like real meat and tastes pretty darn similar. I think the texture is what gives it away. The texture is very similar to that of Inari (tofu wrap used at sushi places..) None the less, this place should definitely be bookmarked and is a great healthier alternative to the real stuff!"

I was in heaven. \n\nMy boyfriend eats meat but got the honey walnut shrimp. I think he was expecting it to taste like the stuff from Panda Express but the sauce was a little different and he wasn't a fan.

I was just as happy as the first time but ended up eating all of my boyfriend's food again. That crispy beef reminds me of jerky, but less chewy. Crispy, thin, and DELICIOUS.\n\nIt still astounds me how they can offer so many vegetarian options, all that actually sound appealing. I went to the market underneath them (as they are upstairs) and they actually do sell vegetarian meat substitutes in there. I can't make it as good as the people at the Veggie House, so I will definitely continue to come back. \n\nAlso, the servers are always so sweet!!"

After living in a small town in Tennessee for two years, the options here are limitless.\n\nWe arrived there for a late dinner.  We ordered the Spring Rolls, Sesame \"Chicken,\" and House Chow Fun.  Their servings are massive.  If you just walked up from the street and had no idea this was a vegetarian place, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  We felt we cheated on our pescatarian diet after eating here.  That's how real it tasted.  The dishes come with your choice of brown or steamed rice.  We shared both dishes and we were stuffed to our gills.  \n\nThe service was great.  All the servers were attentive and made sure we were happy by filling up our drinks and asking if we needed anything.  We need to try their desserts next time.  We were so full, we couldn't eat another morsel.\n\nOverall, this place is a real gem for vegetarians everywhere.

The fried oyster mushroom had that juicy interior that all fried foods should have, but don't. A big plus. My guess is that most people would find the Veggie House surprisingly good. However...the sodium and fat that is added in order to accomplish the transformation of vegey  into meat taste is, for me anyway, overpowering.

My honey enjoyed this dish!\n\nPAN FRIED NOODLES was the bomb! A MUST ORDER!! If you get this To-Go. Ask for the sauce on the side otherwise you'll come home to soggy noodles and the crunchy noodle helps make this dish what it is. \n\nFRIED BANANA with Vanilla Ice \"cream\". Typical fried banana dessert. Not too sweet. Good flavor. \n\nOn our 2nd trip we ordered...\n\nCURRY & ROTI (appetizer) ORDER THIS!! You will not regret it. I think it's one of the best curry dish I've ever had. I would order this as an entree if they offer it!!\n\nORANGE CHICKEN...lightly deep fried but was surprise with the spiciness of the dish. Not my favorite but still a contender for those who like sweet, spicy and crunchy. \n\nCHOW MEIN was excellent. I had it the next day for leftovers and still tasted awesome.

Kenny, the owner and master chef is knowledgeable offering suggestions on customer favorites and telling me what I might not like.  As I waited for food to go he fed me samples!  They are all about the customer and pleasing.  Lotus root cake, crispy veggie beef, chicken and mushrooms, chicken vegetable sizzling plate amungst the tastiest food they have to offer.  My 1 and 3 year old girls could not get enough of the soy shrimp.  I also ate in the restaurant for my mom's birthday and they treated us like family!!!  Such an excellent find for vegans and non-vegans alike.  My new favorite restaurant!"

We just pretty much didn't know what to do. We searched for vegan restaurants and came upon Veggie House. My wife and I were unsure of eating vegan Chinese food but we gave it try. We went and asked the waitress if everything was vegan and it is except for a couple dishes that have egg in it but you can ask to have without the egg. We ordered Walnut Shrimp, Orange Chicken, House Lo-Mein, and Beef and Broccoli. When we first got the food on the table it looked like normal Chinese food. I took my first bite and it tasted amazing. Not just amazing for vegan food but amazing overall! This place is the best Chinese food I've had in years period!!! You wouldn't even think it was vegan. My wife and I took family there and they didn't even know it was vegan. They thought it was all actual chicken, shrimp, and beef. Their minds were blown when we told them it was vegan lol. I frequent this place about once a week maybe twice. Hands down a must place to go for anyone who LOVES good food."

A meal without meat can hardly be called a meal. On top of that the word is vegetable, not veggie, there are few things I hate more than the term veggie. That all being said, this place is great. I went in with much trepidation (I was having lunch with a friend and this was his pick). I figured I would order vegetable fried rice or something inoffensive like that, you see I also don't like substitutes, I don't like fake sugar, I don't like carib, I don't like soy for meat. My friend talked me into the crispy \"beef\". I reluctantly agreed. I was pleasantly surprised, it was so good I forgot I was eating tofu. So here I stand (or sit at my computer) having to admit I was wrong and in fact sometimes a meal without meat is still indeed a meal. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"

My party of 4 waited over 15 minutes without even being acknowledged or having our drink order taken. My daughter finally got up to nicely ask if when she had a chance if she could get us some water and the worker put up her hand and her and said \"I'm busy\" and walked away.

It's funny and incredibly ironic that you obviously know yelp but even better that you actually review the restaurant afterward complaining it's fake meat! Maybe you should use yelp to gain insight on the restaurant before you go rather than using yelp to complain about a place that only serves \"fake meat\". What is wrong with people?!? \n\nVery cute restaurant is a strip mall in an Asian district (we saw thai, Japanese and Chinese places). We found this place on yelp and decided to try it out as me and the SO are vegetarians. The restaurant is hard to see up on the 2nd floor from the parking lot entrance...\n\nWe ordered pick up and it was already waiting for us when we got there. Price was great for the amount of food we got. Sweet and sour chicken had some odd chewy pieces (maybe trying to replicate real chicken dishes?) General tso's wad great as well as the spring rolls. \n\nFood was hot and well packaged to go. Restaurant had super cute decor.\n\nLady who helped us was really nice.\n\nKnocked that 1 star off because of the chewy pieces in the sweet and sour (about 10% of them) but we will be back.\n\nI'd recommend...good vegetarian cuisine with cheap prices and good ambience."

But I'm thankful and happy to had found Veggie House on Yelp, which I'd like to think of as Vegas' own Happy Family. \n\nFOOD\n+Vegetable Soup: This is a complimentary bowl of soup that comes with your order(s). Swimming in a light broth are chopped carrots, celery, onions, and cabbage. The soup is on the bland side and is in need of salt or other seasonings to give it some life. \n\n+Walnut Shrimp:  Lightly battered and fried \"shrimp\" in mayonnaise sauce that's topped with toasted walnuts. Sure enough, it tasted like walnut shrimp. Could've fooled me into thinking it was real shrimp I was biting into. Mayonnaise sauce is a bit much, and I had to wipe the excess off onto my plate.  \n\n+Yee Shang: Soft pieces of eggplant wading in a sweet and spicy sauce. I asked our waitress how spicy is the dish, and she said the chef could prepare it \"very spicy\", which was what I ordered. When I took a bite out of my eggplant, I tasted no spiciness whatsoever. I took another bite thinking that if the first one didn't hit me then the second one will. Nope. Mouth wasn't on fire. Our waitress returned and asked if the eggplant was spicy enough. I said it wasn't spicy at all. Even my friend who has a lower tolerance to spice agreed. So the waitress gave me a small saucer of hot chili sauce that helped resolved the minor issue (nice!). Spicy or not the eggplant is just as delicious without the extra heat.\n\n+Crispy Oyster Mushroom: This was my friend's order. Deep fried oyster mushrooms and a side of white rice. Of course this was good, because it was deep fried! \n\n+Orders come with your choice of white or brown rice. If you order a lunch special ($6.50!), you can choose to order a bun instead.\n\nSERVICE\nFantastic. The two waitresses were so kind and helpful. Even the chef came out from the kitchen to ask about our meal. The service made me feel welcome.\n\nRESTAURANT\nAside from being clean and bright, this restaurant has a soothing quality to it, thanks to the fountain located on one end of the restaurant. Also, if someone claps or maybe drops a pot or pan in the back, a pair of fake birds start to chirp once their sensors go off. Definitely cute and unexpected. \n\nOVERALL\nI'm rating Veggie House 4.50 Stars because of how both my orders had too much sauce, and also for the bland soup that was served prior to the main courses. Other than those criticisms, Veggie House has saved me a long trip to SoCal for vegetarian Chinese food. This is a return spot for me."

With an average of 5 stars and a new placement atop my \"Best Match\" list here on Yelp, I was finally tempted to call in a take-out order.   In going through what I could see of the menu in the pics here combined with my fear of vegan \"meat\", I decided upon the highly lauded Crispy, Spicy eggplant lunch special with brown rice and a regular iced tea to drink.  They told me 10 minutes it'd be ready (fast!) and I probably got there 15 minutes after.  It's upstairs?  Minus one star.  Just kidding, but I am lazy so I took the elevator.\n\nIt took them a short while to realize I was at the front waiting, but not crazily long and they apologized so no harm done (I also didn't try to flag them down or anything), and I paid for the meal (reasonable at $9 for food and drink combined) and left.  First thing I noticed which was odd was that it was all bagged up, even the iced tea.  I can understand the thinking that it could be more convenient to carry it this way, but when I got to the car I immediately went to remove it because I don't like my hot and cold items so close to each other when I get takeout.  I then noticed that the tea was in a gigantic soup container, and not a normal takeout cup, meaning it was very wide and the lid did not have an opening for a straw.  Given it's width it wouldn't fit in my cupholders so right back into the bag it went.  You win this round Veggie house.  On the plus side it contained a LOT of tea, and I've never been more AMPED to work on Excel spreadsheets on a Friday afternoon in my life.\n\nIn getting to work I was a little disappointed when unpacking the bag to find that there was simply the rice and eggplant (and the tea) inside.  The menu states it is served with a daily soup and also lists a \"Bun Roll\" and some sort of sweet potato rice but now I can see how that might be part of an option I could have chosen instead of the brown rice?  Alright look, I still could have used some soup, and they CLEARLY have to go soup containers.  I know several places make those sort of lunch special components dine-in only, but I didn't see any mention of that being the case here so I was still sad about it.   \n\nAs for the eggplant and brown rice, they tasted really great as others have mentioned, but I have a big issue with the eggplant being called spicy because there was ZERO HINT OF SPICINESS whatsoever.  On a scale of 1-10 it was literally a 1 if not a zero.  It was much more sweet than spicy which was a disappointment for me as I love spice.  I'm not sure if I should have specified that I wanted it really spicy, or if my understanding of vegan spice is too limited to understand the deal, but I didn't feel like I ultimately got what I wanted.  The flavors were still nice, and I would definitely give Veggie House another try in the future.   Maybe by then they'll have to-go cups?"

            "review": "Been here twice now, once dine in and once take out.  First time we dined in we ordered veggie dumplings, veggie spicy crispy beef, scallop pan fried noodle and Thai Tom Yum soup.  Everything was awesome!  I liked my pan fried noodles more than his crispy beef but it was still so good.  We also ordered Vegan ice cream desserts which ended our meals with full bellies and not as much guilt.  Our servers were great also, she was recommending things and talking to us about being vegan.  She was telling us how she was Vegan 80% but has a small piece if fish every once in a while.  I'm currently in the same boat where I'm slowly going vegan but have meat/dairy once in a while.  They made us feel very comfortable and constantly checked up on us/ cleared out empty plates throughout our meal.  When we returned and ordered take out, at least 3 servers came up to us to ask us if anyone has already helped us, even Chef came out to take a look outside and mentioned to us how great the weather was today.  Food was prepared and brought out to us quick and thanked us for coming by.  Our take out lunch specials were General Tzo chicken and the curry/potato chicken.  Again, I liked my general chicken better than his curry but again, both were good.  *they have a Groupons available every once in a while so be on the lookout for those."

            "review": "An oasis in a vegetarian food desert!  The location is a little tough to find (2nd floor, corner, in a strip mall), but upon arriving your are greeted by an amusing sign forbidding you to bring any meat into the restaurant (no BYO meat!  lol).   The menu has a lot of options (which are played on 2 TV screens as you wait  *drool*).   Having read the Yelp reviews we decided to go with a bunch of items including some of the favorites:  Roti, Lettuce Wraps, and Crispy Spicy Eggplant.  The Eggplant dish was tasty but you definitely want a larger group to take down this platter.. nice and crispy, but obviously very fried.. good flavor.. and probably at least an entire eggplant.   The Roti and Lettuce Wraps were two of the favorite dishes.  The entrees came with tasty brown rice.  We opted to avoid the \"fake meat\" style dishes and went more with the vegetables/tofu/fried rice/noodles-type dishes.  Dessert was decent - vegan ice cream was tasty, but a tad icy and the fried root was only good as an ornament in my opinion.  vegan cheesecake was pretty yummy.  \n\nWhen we arrived there were ~5 other tables... not bad for Weds at 7:00, but not busy.  However once our food came out (remarkably quickly!) the business started to pick up!  When we left most of the restaurant was impressively filled.  \n\nOverall a good experience, quick service, tasty food.  The owner was very friendly and came by our table a couple times to chat.  We also saw him cleaning off tables and helping the staff (very respectable).  Would go again!"

Many of the businesses pay to get rid of bad reviews.  This may be one of them.  The service is good. The food is OK also, but it is no way near the good quality food I had years ago at a similar restaurants.  BBQ pork is great.  The spicy fried eggplant was not. We ordered a crab and shark fin soup, a combination cold dish of 3 items, a fried lotus root cake, a crispy spicy beef, and a fried spicy eggplant dish. The three of us could finish neither the crispy spicy beef, nor the fried spicy eggplant because they tasted very similar. The beef was just fried some thin material, not very good.  \nI will be very careful in trusting Yelp review in the future."

Regardless, this is a place I otherwise would not have known about let alone gone to, had it not come up on my favorite green website.\n\nAfter extensively perusing reviews here and the menu online, I finally went in to order my takeout- wonton ramen soup, spicy crispy eggplant with brown rice, and green tea ice cream with sticky rice.\n\nThe spicy crispy eggplant is out of this world. It's amazing, and I'd come back just for this dish- side of brown rice wasn't even necessary. Delicious way to have eggplant, and despite being a sticky and almost sweet sauce it did not feel like a heavy meal. \n\nThe won ton soup was a bit underwhelming. I did appreciate how the noodles were packed separately for my takeout order so as not to fall apart in the broth, and I liked the won tons themselves. But the broth was lacking. I liked the green taste to it, and it oddly reminded me of a green smoothie, except in broth form. As in, you could taste the veggie vibrancy. But it was still somehow flat. Noodles were also much thinner than I prefer, and seemed to simply be thin spaghetti rather than ramen.\n\nThe dessert was underwhelming as well. The green tea ice cream melted very quickly and was also lacking in flavor- I've experienced varieties with more of a chalky texture but stronger machta taste, but this version was on the thin side rather than creamy. Also struck me as odd that the sticy rice was orange."

            "review": "A phenomenal hidden gem near the Las Vegas Strip! My husband and I recently moved from the Bay area where we had a variety of vegan restaurant options. Moving to Vegas was disheartening because the dining choices are not as vegan friend as we used to. When a group of friends visited from Cali, they were considered enough to offer going to a vegan restaurant. From the group of 6, I was the only vegan, my friend was a pescatarian and the rest of the group were omnivores/carnivores. \n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes and a total of four soups, which were initially brought out. One soup was better than the other and I was continually amazed at the phenomenal taste and authentic flavors of each soup. My friends were equally delighted. As the dishes came out, everybody was amazed how \"real\" the food tasted. In fact, one of them apparently did not even realize he was eating imitation meat! He just thought that the restaurant was vegan friendly but that they had meat options. This is a guy who eats meat for every meal!\n\nAfter hearing  everyone's very positive feedback, a few days later I invited another visitor friend of mine to try their dining experience. She absolutely loved it as well. \n\nAfter the first visit to say the least, I've gone back a lot more. Each time, the atmosphere has been very relaxing and zen; the staff very approachable and extremely friendly; the food has been consistently delicious!!\n\nOverall, this place is definitely my new go-to place for everything- whether it'd be to treat a cold, take our guests, or just have a great time. (When I feel a bit under the weather or get a cold, their soups are a must. I completely recover the day after!)\n\nIf you're a local, whether vegan or not, this place is a must to check out! If you've visiting, they're very close to the strip so be sure to visit for a very relaxing and delicious experience. \n\nNOTE FOR THE VEGANS: If you are Vegan, make sure to let the staff know. I was told that some of their foods may contain eggs- but nothing more. Make sure to ask and they'll let you know the dishes that are off limits."

We had the Spring Rolls, Lettuce Wraps, Hot and Sour Soup and Kung Pao V Chicken.  Each course was tasty, fresh and distinct.  The flavors and textures were amazing mimics of some of the better meat-based Chinese dishes we have had and would easily fool someone who wasn't told in advance that no flesh would be consumed.  The menu is as dense as any good Chinese restaurant and the owner insisted we try his \"goose\" and \"duck\" the next time we visit because in his words they are \"awesome!\"\nIn addition to the great food, the pride of ownership is unmistakeable and an all too rare quality in many restaurants.  We listened in on a conversation the owner had with another table and then spoke with him ourselves and learned of what a strong passion he has for introducing more people to great vegetarian eating.  The decor is lovely and our server seemed genuinely pleased with our enjoyment of the meal.

The flavor however was a little off for me.\n\nCrunchy spicy eggplant: Definitely a must order.  \n\nPineapple duck: This was probably my least favorite dish. The texture of the 'duck' was alright with me however the flavor tasted a little burnt to me. Can't really describe it but it didn't taste good to me. \n\nWalnut shrimp: One of my favorites from dinner too. Texture was good and flavor was good."

The curry sauce creates the perfect gravy for the chicken and potatoes. An ideal comfort food! \n-Geese: Amazing layers of veggies with a crispy outer crust. I don't know how the Chef makes this one, but it's divine. Pair your leftovers with a salad and you'll have a great lunch the next day. \n-General Tzo Chicken: This is my non-vegetarian boyfriend's most favorite dish. He says it reminds him of Orange Chicken and he literally orders it every single time.\n-Crispy Spicy Eggplant: A lot of reviewers hailed this as the most delicious dish on the menu, but this is where I'm going to have to disagree. I found it to be too sweet and the sauce to be too thick to properly enjoy.\n-Crab Meat Shark Fin Soup: We decided to try something different when we ordered this one with egg drops. It was interesting, but not a hit. I think it would have been better without the egg, so consider that before ordering. \n-Walnut Shrimp: I found the faux-seafood to be too convincing. Ordinarily, that's a compliment to the chef. However, when things taste a little too much like the \"real deal,\" I start to freak out and panic and can't enjoy the meal because I worry I accidentally ate meat. I'm a crazy vegetarian, what can I say.\n-Drinks: No fountain drinks, but a decent selection of canned or bottled sodas and juices. \n\nWorth noting, I have taken both my younger brother (who would live off Carl's Jr. if he could) and boyfriend (who usually threatens to break up with me any time I recommend a vegetarian restaurant for dinner) here and they both loved it just as much as I did. So, rest-assured vegetarians and meat-eaters alike will enjoy this place! You can even bring your pet T-Rex!"

The biggest issue was that there were only 2 waitresses who were both taking orders and serving food, which made the service very slow. The waitress took about 10 minutes to come around to our table and forgot to ask for what drinks we wanted until I mentioned it. In addition, it took a while to get either waitress' attention when we need ed napkins or extra utensils. Lastly, we had ordered the the Fried Ice Cream with Mango Ice Cream, however, our waitress failed to mention that they only had one flavor of ice cream. When we told her about the mistake, she just curtly explained that they only had one flavor in stock. It was just a frustrating experience.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but the service lacking. I would come back to eat the Crispy Eggplant because it was SO GOOD."

I am all for fake meat (because I can only eat so much tofu). Veggie House is among a cluster of Asian restaurants in Chinatown on the second floor.    \n\nI walked in and heard what I thought was a bird chipping. Wait, isn't that a health code violation? Just kidding, it's just for sound effects! It was a Saturday night, but we were immediately seated. The waitress took the time to explain that the Veggie House menu is 100% vegan (unless you specifically request that you want eggs or something in your fried rice). \n\nI went with the Sesame chicken ($10.95) and my husband ordered Curry Chicken ($10.95). Less than 5 minutes later, our food was coming to the table! I think Veggie House broke the record for quickest cooking times. \n\nCURRY CHICKEN: The curry chicken came out in a Pyrex looking pie platter. Kind of weird. The curry chicken came with potatoes, cauliflower, and LOADS of bell pepper strips. The best parts were the potatoes and cauliflower. The \"chicken\" was too soggy/stringy for me.  \n\nSESAME CHICKEN: I wish it was spicier. The hot chile pepper indicating heat on the menu is a farce! At least for the sesame chicken. Other than that gripe, I really liked my entree. The chicken was super crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It tasted like it was deep fried and reminded me of a dessert, but in a good way. On a side note, the sesame chicken made for decent leftovers! Oh yeah.\n\nATMOSPHERE: It seemed kind of dated in here. Could use a little pick me up.\n\nAfter a Groupon, the total came to $10.97 (deal was $11 for $20). Not bad!\n\nReturn visit? Is a tin man's dick made of sheet metal? Yes!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #18"

We looked for a health department rating  and didn't see one. We decided to head over to Veggie House, and  immediately decided we would dine there instead. (\"A\" rating, tablecloths, and sign that read, \"Please do not bring in seafood or meat.\") I have eaten at Vegan Chinese restaurants in Philly and New York, but this one in VEGAS is the best by far.  Chef Kenny prepares the meals in a gourmet fashion. In a swanky setting, these meals could easily go for 3X the price. The portions are very generous, and each entree is bursting with a multitude of flavors. We had the fried wonton appetizers, which had a wonderful crispy texture and flavor.  I had the walnut scallops, which were out of this world. The flavor was so unique and amazing. My husband ordered the General Tzo's chicken which was equally tasty. Did I mention the pumpkin cheesecake? WOW. The food was served to us very quickly and the service was top-notch and incredibly friendly! A+++++ We will definitely dine here again and spread the word!"

I don't think you could really tell it apart from meat. \n\nThe Pad Thai came with shrimp and chicken, and although they were imitation meat, my husband couldn't bring himself to eat it.

Sosososososososososo good y'all!!!"

            "review": "This place is my favorite go-to restaurant! Chinese food has always been my guilty pleasure, and Americanized Chinese food holds a place very, very close to my heart.\n\nSince going back to vegetarianism a few months ago, Veggie House has been there for me and I'm always excited to treat myself here! You are seated very quickly, orders are accurate, servers are polite, food is delicious, and I've never once left feeling dissatisfied. What does that tell ya?!\n\nSo far, I've ordered all of the stereotypical 'Chinese' dishes and have yet to be disappointed. I can't wait to come back, branch out, and order something I won't see at a Panda Express. Lol. My favorites have been the house fried rice (Asian food necessity), pan fried fish (crispy and flavorful) and the orange chicken (of course, of course). If you order beef or shrimp, you'll find that the texture is closer to tofu but it's delicious nonetheless. Oh! Unless it's the crispy beef... That stuff is so spot on that I'm afraid it's real!\n\nI've also brought my meat-loving family members here and they were impressed! It's always nice to look at a menu and not have to feel like your options are limited. I'm very glad this establishment exists, and I will always be coming back!"

We ordered the orange chicken, hot and sour soup, beef sizzling plate and egg rolls. The soup and egg rolls were my favorite. \n\nTheir sister location VegeWay is by far my favorite vegan restaurant in the SW area! Who am I kidding it's really good but Wynn has better options. For the price, looking for fast, cheap, vegan food. It's the best!!!"

I loved the Kung Pao.  It is presently located Upstairs in the southeast corner in the Pacific Asian Plaza Suite 203, at 5115 Spring Mt. Road.  I found the place clean with a nice atmosphere of Asian decor.  Peggy was our server and was one of the best servers I've had in any restaurant.  Peggy explained what ingredients were in all of the dishes we inquired about and was very professional and patient while we decided what we wanted.  Hot tea and was served and we ordered Hot/Sour soup, Kung Pao Chicken and Crispy Eggplant.  I think it was bean curd they used instead of meat, ( I could not tell the difference from real meat) and a choice of Rice or other options were available.  It was one of the most delicious dishes I have ever eaten.  Both dishes seemed to have a braised flavor and could not have been better.  We ate \"ice creme\" (No dairy products used) with fried banana and it was excellent.  The restaurant uses no meat in any dishes, or onion or garlic and I was blown away with how good the food was.  I can't wait to return and try the crispy \"beef\" and several dishes I viewed other customers eating.    The prices were more than reasonable with lunch specials and appetizers available.  I recommend this restaurants to all ages and to those that have not tried Vegan dishes.  I am not well versed in Vegan dishes, but I do know what I like and I liked the dinning experience I had at the Veggie House."

So deceivingly good I forget its all Vegan! Also, the Green Tea they provide is great!\n\nMake sure to check-in as well and you'll get 10% off your bill."

She said if I didn't like it she would take it back and bring me something else.\n\nThe lotus cakes were delicious.  I'm not sure exactly what they were made of, but it included round slivers of lotus root with a coating of some kind of protein on one side (TVP?), fried with a tasty brown sauce.  As stated in other reviews, the service is excellent here.  The waitress asked me how I liked the food, which is actually pretty unusual at a Chinese restaurant.  Then the cook came out and asked everybody how they liked the food.  They really care about what they're doing at the Veggie House.\n\nThis would be a good restaurant to visit with a group so that you can try many different dishes family style.  Next time I will bring some friends with me."

            "review": "Time to rave about one of my favorite Vegetarian restaurants! \n\nHeck, Veggie House is one of my favorite restaurants in general. Chef Kenny's creations are seriously some of the best of both Chinese and Vegan cuisine! I've tried several different dishes here, and they have all been nothing short of amazing. On my first visit, I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp. I was a little skeptical at first, especially once my meal came out. \"Looks like shrimp... Tastes like shrimp... But it's not shrimp!\" How he is able to replicate the exact taste and appearance of real shrimp is the beyond me. What I am able to tell you is how much I loved my meal! The shrimp's sauce was so creamy and had a hint of sweetness. His vegetarian twist definitely did this popular Chinese dish justice.\n\nSince we practically live in Chinatown, this is a usual spot for me and Hubby to dine. He always orders the Kung Pao Chicken, which is another excellent choice. I would also recommend the Hong Shao Tofu and General Tso's Chicken- Two of my favorite Chinese dishes. The texture of the chicken (tofu?) is so spot on, it's crazy! You will definitely have to try this place out for yourself to see what I'm talking about. And don't worry my fellow meat lovers, I guarantee these vegan dishes will keep you coming back for more."

            "review": "So let's start this by saying that I am NOT a vegetarian let alone a vegan.  I have much respect for people that can live that lifestyle. . .but I love me some BEEF!  =)\n\nNow that being said. . .when I first went to Veggie House. . .I was wondering how I was going to like the fake meat.  Trust me. . .I had serious doubts. . .but my friends wanted to go and try it, so I went along with them. . .\n\nMaybe it was because my expectations were so low. . .that first time. . .but everything that we had was DELICIOUS and so on point.  I think I asked the wait staff about 5 times in that meal. . .you sure this is not real meat???  =)  The textures of the differnet meats that we had were really to close to what you would think the real stuff would be like.  We had crispy beef, crispy eggplant, General Tzo's chicken and some other items that I can not remember the name of. . .they were all surpisingly on point!\n\nOne of my friends actually had an issue with the texture of his pork dish. . .and you know what?  I tried it and honestly. . .the texture of the fake pork was the texture of the real pork in the same dish in other chinese restaurants I had before.  The texture tended to be a little on the chewy side and Veggie House was true to form. . .they made the fake pork like it was supposed to be!  crazy. . .crazy delicious!!  =)\n\nOn my second trip. . .i had their crispy beef again. . .and it did not disappoint. . .it was so good!!  Loved it!\n\nI also had their Cilantro salad. . .and OMG. . .if you are a cilatnro fan like me. . .you will love this salad.  They chopped cilantro tossed it in a soy sauced vinegrette with a slgiht kick and mixed it with slices of pressed tofu and some fried eggroll skins for texture. . .it was freaking delicious!  I could eat it everyday and I probably would not get tired of it.  =)\n\nI also had their Roti with curry which the serve told me was one of their more popular apps. . .this was one of the dishes that I did not like as much.  The roti was awesome!  BUT the curry was a little on the too sweet side for me.  As I progressed and ate more of the curry. . .the flavors did deepen and I was able to taste more of the nuances of the dish. . .but the sweetness lasted througout and it kind of made it weird for me.  This was the only dish that I had that was NOT a 5 star dish.  \n\nAmbiance. . .(4/5)  It's a little weird inside as it reminds me of huts with straw roofs. . .but for the most part I can ignore it and just focus on the great food.  =)\n\nService. . .very prompt and very cordial (5/5).\n\nNow if all vegan places tasted as good as Veggie House. . .I could be a vegan but until that time I will enjoy my vegan meals here. . .and enjoy the real stuff elsewhere.  =)  I will definitely be back!"

We ordered the crispy eggplant that was recommended by many yelpers, the crispy veggie scallops, and the steamed ginger chicken with brown rice.\n\nThe crispy eggplant was really delicious. As stated by some yelpers, they are like french fries, but with a twist!! It was topped off with garlic, which I love!!! The steamed ginger chicken was to die for!!! It amazes me that its not chicken, but it tastes like chicken!!! It was mind boggling. hahaha. As for the crispy veggie scallops, it was good, but not great. I think it is because I am a huge scallop lover and I love the real thing. As for the price, they give you A LOT of food for what you pay for. =) Since I am a piggy, more the food... the more the merrier!! ::CHOMP CHOMP::\n\nThe staff was incredibly nice. At one point, the waitress introduced us to Chef Kenny. He was so nice and humble. Although we aren't vegetarian (except for my friend) we loved the food and definitely will be back.  I can't wait to try more things and maybe one day I will convert into becoming vegetarian!!"
