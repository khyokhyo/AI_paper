            "review": "I visited Mint indian bistro twice during my second trip to vegas. It was great as usual. We booked the table in advance. Food was really superb. The starter gobi chilli and the dessert ras malai was extra ordinary. Staffs and Their customer service is very welcoming. The quality of the food remains high during both my visits. Their south indian delicacies masala dosa was really great. Since i am from south india i was very particular about sambar( dal soup). Their sambar was really delicious. I loved the masala dosa totally. I will surely come to Mint whenever i visit Vegas."

            "review": "I am soo in love with this place!!! If I lived in the area, I know I'd come back all the time! Although their menu is quite large, they offer a useful & effective ordering system - Aside every menu item comes a list of options for how you would like your order prepared (i.e. with or without butter, onions, garlic), what you would like in it (cheese, veggies, chicken, lamb, fish), & the size/ cost (half or full order on some things), etc. with a really cute/ funny description of each dish. Some key symbols you will see throughout the menu are \"V\" for Vegetarian, \"Vn\" for Vegan, \"G\" for Gluten-free, \"J\" for Jain (w/out onions & garlic), & \"N\" for nut-related products, as well as \"H\" for choices that are considered healthy. Although this may not be of concern to some people, I found it to be very helpful & this made it much easier for me to order my food exactly how I wanted it. \nFor my dinner, I tried the Vertical Vindaloo w/ Fresh Veggies & Veggie Tikka Masala Curries w/ Paratha. I enjoyed both dishes & was really glad I went with the Paratha instead of the usual Naan since I love Whole Wheat products & wanted to try something different. Also, I love that they carry brown basmati rice & even give you a side of regular white basmati rice when you order curry, as most places I've been to have not done this. But, keep in mind that half orders of curry are probably smaller than you might think, so it's probably best to place full orders since their dishes are so good anyway! In addition to the rice & noodle dishes, soups & salads, & curries, they also have some good-looking dosas & condiments like tomato, mango, or coconut chutney for only 1$ :) \nOur service was very nice & attentive too; We had multiple people check on us throughout our meal & each brought us everything we asked for w/out any problems. I had a really good experience here & can't wait to come back!"

We have been here on date nights and brought friends here for dinner only.\n\nThe only con I have is the service can be slow, well most of the time the service here is slow. They always seem disorganized and usually forget an item or two that we order. I understand duh this is not fast food...the guys just always seem flustered. We always overlook it and never are in a hurry to inhale food anyway.\n\nBeing vegan we have TONS of options to choose from and we usually just tell the server to pick a potato curry dish, a veggie dish, an app and a chef special creation.\nWe always get two orders of garlic bread we order extra garlic and it's amazing!!!!\n\nEvery meal is different and every experience has been very flavorful and fresh! When you let them order it really does make for a more unique and special dinner.\n\nOrganic tea selection is top notch and my fav is a rooibos called African Sunset. Warm and yummmmy.\n\nThe lassi choices are amazing. Between the lassi bar and the hot teas...it's tempting to go here all the time just for beverages.\n\nOH!!! I loooooove their vegan and gluten free options for beer and adult drinks. Very nice! The large selection is amazing!"

The price is $9.99 and they usually have a good variety of indian dishes.  If they have Tikka Masala, it is usually watered down... but everthing else is good, especially the Chicken Pakora.   I like the salad area, where they have some nice chutneys.   The nan is good, but they don't always ask if you want more.....and sometimes they get busy and don't refill your water... and if you have a burn going..... that could be dangerous.  Of all the indian restaurants near the strip, this is probably the best.  This place can get full very fast, because it is small.   Parking is not so good, as it is in a busy little strip of stores.  They open at 11:30.   Enjoy!"

Their close proximity to the strip leaves them hopeful that others will come. But in the meantime, alienate the customers who are already here and ready to pay....very stupid practice! The place is all pretty on the inside. Cute decor and the sexiest buddha sitting in the midst. But the service was horrible. We decided to sit at the counter and watch the shenanigans. Parties of two constantly being wait listed or sent to the bar then looking around and leaving. Larger parties being sat (without a reservation mind you). Our food was brought out over spice, cold and tasteless. They made the list of worst Indian food I've ever had, and I eat plenty. All pomp and circumstance. Not the place to go if you really want to eat great Indian in Vegas. Tourist trap...."

            "review": "I wonder how these people are making money, probably because their customer base is not Indian. Thus no one knows how real Indian food tastes. The papri chat was insipid, one could only taste yogurt, no seasoning. In fact the papri smelled \"old\". The entree, malai kofta was overwhelmingly sweet. The koftas barely had any paneer or what is known as cottage cheese, which it is supposed to have. The \"rotis\" or flatbread were burnt, we could barely bite into it. Rather we had to pull it apart.\n These people don't seem to care their customers either. We kept waiting for someone to come and take our order. \nWe were very disappointed with their food and service. The only thing that was good was the papad served at the very beginning. These people seriously need to taste their own food and then change their cook. Doesn't seem like the owners know the taste of the food that comes out of their restaurant's kitchen. \n  I am going for 1/5 only because I need to rate them."

The tika masala was rich, creamy, very spicy and white chicken breast was abundant and big. The palak paneer was incredible and spicy. But the best of all were the desserts, the mango custard was too good and the Gulab was firm, yet soft soaked but not soggy. The syrup was buttery sweetness !  This place rocks. We had to wait 20min for Saturday buffet at 2pm but it was worth any kind of wait times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

It's in a small area, so walking just a couple min in fire bc you parked so far is a pain\n- Clean. To my surprise, the restaurant is pretty elegant. nice plates and fancy cup glasses.\n- comparing my experiences with indian restaurants near UC Davis, the food is not spicy at all. I was expecting it to be packed with flavor, but curries were nothing close. For my tastes, overall somewhat bland and dry.\n- Garlic naan was great! fresh! But comes with a caveat. it takes forever for you to get some. \n- Although it is AYCE, Don't expect to be coming back for more and more. Not much of a selection to choose from so I would say at most 3 plates. After a while, the food gets redundant."

They usually have a lunch buffet which is a great price and if you are a UNLV student you'll get like a 10% discount as well. The food is delicious and their is a large variety of items in their buffet. They of course serve naan as well, my personal favorite is the garlic naan because who doesn't love garlic?!\n\nEach time I have came they have always been super attentive and great with customer service as well. Love their bone in goat curry, paneer (actually any paneer dish!) tiki masala, and you gotta get  a lassi drink, especially if it's your first time at an indian place. Definitely a good choice if you're in the neighborhood!"

The food was reasonably priced and tasted great!  A little spicier than most of the Indian restaurants I've been to, but that doesn't bother me.  The buffet was pretty big - I really like the chicken korma and tika masala, and the galob jamon for dessert was everything I hoped it would be!  We had a mango lassi, and a cherry lassi for the first time ever - both were really good.  Can't wait to go back and order off the regular menu!"

Sure the waiver seems a bit ridiculous (and full of grammatical errors), but after attempting the inferno curry, I don't blame them for the warning. It's just so. damn. hot. I'm a 10 at every Indian and Thai place in town, so I figured this would be a fun challenge. I had my naan, large Kingfisher, and dove into the curry pot. At the 3rd bite, I could no longer feel my mouth. It was awesome (no, really, I'm a crazy person). There were so many ghost chilis in that pot that my insides actually radiated heat for 2 days. This place is cool - but next time I'll stick with the vindaloo!"

I thought this was a bit rude but he explained that they have an app to place orders. Pretty cool. We started off with a salty mango lassi which was delicious.\n\nFor our main course we ordered the Indian Sampler ($30.99) that featured garlic naan, veg pakodas, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, tandoori chicken, mixed veg curry, lentils, yogurt, rice, and a milky rice pudding (khir). We liked the idea of having a little taste of everything and boy did we! The food was outstanding, but the servings were kind of small. I was satisfied, but my boyfriend could have eaten more. They did bring out more rice when they saw we were getting low.  \n\nTip: They also serve Halal meats and they will call a cab for you when your meal is over."

I've known this to happen before to some of my friends at indian restaurants when the server makes a size-you-up decision that you can't handle it, but really, this time they should have concluded that we can, given a) we were indian. b) we kept repeating about how much we loved spicy food. oh well.\n\nMinor nitpick aside, the food is pretty great, especially some of the nepalese dishes, which are pretty rare (i've only been able to find one restaurant in chicago!)\n\nIf i ever decide that going down on vegas junkets to behave outrageously and pretend you're exempt from all rules becomes a regular habit, mint will be a regular lunch spot too."

Copious laundry yet to be folded and lazy me coerced my husband to thinking that we need to partake in Mint's buffet this last Saturday. I remembered a message one of the owners of Mint had sent me letting me know that they had taken my previous review into consideration and created a better buffet. It's a rare occasion that small business owners give you positive reactions on a negative review so I was impressed enough to give Mint another chance. \n\nWow...the 2 of us were truly surprised (in a really good way) and absolutely enjoyed this buffet. There was a thin tomato soup that was tangy and a prolific salad/chutney assortment. Also their Dal Tadka was to die for. I filled multiple bowls of this delicacy. The pakoras (Indian vegetable tempura) were excellent. Special shout out to the thinly slivered potatoes coated with the garbanzo flour mixture. Yumminess. Soft and airy idlis with a thick and tasty sambar (the best in Vegas thus far) spoke to the South Indian in me. There was lemon rice that was full of flavor and their spicy chau chau noodles that were oh-so-perfect and what I am currently salivating about. There were 3 vegetable dishes (one paneer) and at least 5 meat based dishes on the buffet. Garlic Naans/Plain Naans/Rotis were brought to the table with the blink of an eye. \n\nNow for the grand finale. Dessert...my eyes popped when I saw they served Gulab Jamun (balls of dough and milk, deep fried and served in sugar syrup). The Gulab Jamuns were warm, melt in the mouth and probably the best I've had out here. Dessert Nirvana. \n\nMint pulled out all the stops at their new buffet and I for one, will be a repeat customer as long as I get my belly filled like this. For 9.99, this was a stellar deal and of course, the service was just as impeccable as before with the nice waiters."

Mint Indian Bistro fills the gap that my recent relocation created.\n\nTheir masalas and curries are great and genuinely spicy.  They also have just as many vegetarian options as they do options for carnivores, which is a plus.  It also helps that these vegetarian options are tasty.\n\nAvoid any of their sauced dishes described as \"bone-in\" or \"with bone\".  Bone shards can be found throughout these dishes, and while tasty, a bone can be a real turn off texture wise if you don't break a tooth on it.  That said, this is a minor downside.\n\nNotes:  Baskets of naan like baskets of chips at a Mexican restaurant?  Oh hell yes.  Also, paneer varies from restaurant to restaurant.  The paneer at Mint Indian Bistro is like a firm tofu, which is my favorite style of paneer.  Those of you preferring a creamier paneer are officially on notice.\n\nFor $11 you'd have a hard time finding a better buffet to embarrass yourself at in Vegas."

The food here is NOT Indian, it's Indian made for American taste buds. Yaddaddaimean? But let's get down to the *critiQUE.*\n\nService:\nThere hasn't been a single time that I have come here, in which I have felt comfortable walking through the door. It's always a depressed / emotionally challenged man who takes us to our seat. Water, at first, is there quickly. Refills are scarce to none. We wait 5-10 minutes for the check every time. Never half-a-smile cracked by the server(s)...and everyone who works here looks, plain, miserable. \n\nFood:\nI'm a huge curry fan, and a huge goat fan. Both of these are garbage, here, and this is why: all curry tastes the same, jus different levels of spicyness. The goat is terribly undercooked, chewy, and has NO FLAVOR (as everything else, here, is flavor-less). Today was the last straw. There was hair in my food. Done. I don't pay money for hair.\n\nAfter the fact:\nIve been feeling like crap all day. Stomach is not right. I am unbelievably, and strangely fatigued. I regret this.\n\nThere's nothing here for me. I don't trust this place's discipline in cleanliness at all! I don't trust that it \"matters \" to them until they get caught and shut down! (which they already have, as far as I've heard, for sanitation) they're here for the quick buck. It seems that There's no \"moral standard\" in this business."

It's got some light char to it. It's warm and it's plentiful. The selection is great. So much flavor. Be careful with the spice (not as in heat spicy but spices spicy); it's yummy but it hurts ones belly. The tandoori chicken was super good. The goat dish was very yummy. \n\nThis place is great.

Chicken literally melted in my mouth. The flavor was perfect. By far my favorite item. The chicken chili was also pretty good. Pieces of chicken made with chopped up chunks of red and green bell peppers. Reminded me of chicken Jalfrezi.\nChicken Tikka Masala was a different color than I've normally seen. It was ok but I think I had a hard time getting past the way it looked. I just couldn't' eat it. I prefer mine to be more consistently creamy and a little darker in color. This one was almost the color of salmon.\n\nThe Chicken Ttandoori was as good as I've ever had before, definitely worth it. \nI didn't see Raita on the buffet line. I probably could have asked for it, but they were really busy and I didn't want to be a bother. \n\nI guess I was really thirsty because I finished my first glass of water quickly, instead of refilling it the server set a carafe of water on my table. Now that I think of it, he never asked me what I wanted to drink. Good thing I wanted water because that's what he brought me. \n\nThe Naan could have been better. It seemed to be a little dry or hard. I don't think it was fresh. They were a lot of veggie/vegan options and the ones I tried were pretty good (Potato, Sag Aloo and a few others)\n\nBathrooms are small, only one stall per sex."

I ordered the mango chicken - \"how spicy on a scale of 1 to 10...\", asked our waiter, \"...10 being a volcano and 1 being a babbling brook!\" I ummm and then ordered 7. That was a modestly spicy curry with a sweet tang to it just as promised. The  stuffed paratha has some potato and peas, but not enough for my Indian colleague's liking ;).\n\nThis place is also a hidden gem for beer. The beer menu is extensive, but there were also an additional 15 beers recently added! \"Take a look before you choose\", said our waiter as he pointed to the table with 20 beer bottles on. So I did. And came back with a pint bottle of Belgian lager. Very nice with my mango chicken.\n\nTry this place. I didn't try the buffet. All in all, the portions are good - my colleague and I shared the curry and rice and we had paratha each. I had a beer too and the bill was $38 incl tip. The decor isn't as nice as the Nepalese place in Pasadena, CA, but it's pleasant enough. \n\nOur taxi driver didn't know the name of this place but he'd seen it. But, considering Vegas isn't necessarily a place of culture it's no bad thing if Himalayan is a little obscure and off the beaten track."

Right across the street from UNLV on Flamingo, Mint Bistro is one of the best Indian restaurants in town.  The University/ Paradise section of town already has around 5-6 great Indian restaurants, but Mint Bistro is the best.  \n\nThe outside of the restaurant makes you think that it is a take-out restaurant, but once you walk in you will feel welcomed by the comfortable Indian decor.  I have been to Mint Bistro about 5 times, and have always had great food.  My favorite dish is the Saag Paneer, which is house-made Cheese sauteed with spinach.  They make a very good version of one of my favorite Indian dishes.  I also really like the Mango Masala with Chicken.  This dish combines the classic flavors of a Chicken Masala with the sweet Mango flavor.  The other dish I usually try to get is the Rebel Curry.  Very flavorful, but spicy, curry, served with your choice of meat.  If you are a vegetarian, Mint Bistro has many options for you, but if you eat meat you have many options, too.  \n\nMint Bistro also has a great selection of Belgian Beers.  My favorite that I had was the Duchesse de Bourgogne, but they have many more.  Although it sounds random for a Indian restaurant to have a great selection of Belgian beers, they have some of the best I have seen.  Definitely try the great pairing of the beer with the Indian food.  \n\nIf you are looking for Indian and Nepalese food with a twist, definitely try Mint!"

The lively Bollywood style background music adds a nice touch. Also, the creative art on the walls contributes to an air of whimsy.\n\nNow, onto the food. The buffet starts out with a small but nice selection of simple lettuce salad, various chutneys (mint and mango are my favs) and plain yogurt to tamp down the heat of the curries which aren't really that hot anyways.\n\nWhile I didn't try all the the entrees, a few of my favorites included: Paneer Tikka, Veggie Korma, and Chicken Tikka.  The basmati rice is always a nice addition and works well under the entrees.\n\nI always look forward to the garlic naan bread and it did not disappoint. Just a nice pillowy, but crispy bit of deliciousness. Yum!! I'll take another order please! And another...so addictive.\n\nFound the servers to be attentive and courteous. They are always sure to bring another carafe of ice water.  All restaurants need to have carafes of water as it's a major time saver for the servers and keeps customers happy. \n\nCan't wait to return, but could do without the three children who kept screaming during my lunch."

The mother's day special included a mango lassi (yum!) and  a dolsa (a rolled up pancake with lentil in the middle).  \n\nThe cold bar had varius kinds of churney, a salad, some fruit, and other sauces.  There were also 3 different kinds of soup.  A tomato soup that tasted a bit sour, a lentil based soup, and a spicy soup.\n\nIts got a lot of the standard Indian fare.  What stood out to me was the goat curry.  The goat meat was fall off the bone tender and the curry had an excellent flavor.  Also, the tandoori chicken was nice and juicy.... not dry like a lot of other joints.  The paneer sagg (a spinach and cheese dish) was also pretty good.\n\nThere were some vegetarian dishes but being the carnivore that I am, I did not partake.  I got a taste of India without blowing out my palate on ridiculously spicy food.  That makes this a decent restaurant in my book."

You can't beat $10.99+tax for a delicious lunch buffet with 10% off if you're a UNLV student.  It just doesn't happen.\n\nTheir butter naan is so yummy; I have to remember not to fill up on that so I can fit more delicious food in me.  My OCDness likes that they organize their buffet trays from starters to sides to entrees.  They used to have a dessert warmer at the very end, but I think they nixed this because not enough people were utilizing it during the lunch hours.\n\nMy favorites are (and I will definitely butcher the correct names of these items): the yellow Indian fried rice with vegetables, fried vegetables, the noodles with vegetables, chicken tikka masala (I know that one!), goat curry, and spicy chili chicken.  I'm pretty sure I've tried everything there, but these are my go to dishes.\n\nThe 5 stars comes from food and price alone.  They really do have delicious high quality food.  The service is consistently mediocre if not subpar, but if I'm at Mint it's for the food.  Also, it takes awhile for drinks to come out, especially if you order coffee.  I don't know if it's a cultural thing, but I've almost always received my coffee at the end of my meal. I would prefer it as an accompaniment to my meal.  And getting your bill can take awhile too sometimes.  If I have to leave, I just go up to the counter and pay.\n\nAnd fair warning, you will leave the restaurant full and with a lingering fragrance on your clothing and hair for the rest of the day. You were warned!"

The employees are friendly and attentive. The food is pleasing to the palate. The best part, the lunch buffet is only $9.99. At this price, I can afford to buy lunch for myself and a few friends.\n\nUnlike my last experience at a different restaurant, Mint is great at keeping the hot foods hot and the cold foods cold. The salad and fruit selections were limited, but they were crisp and refreshing. I am a sucker for Indian sauces. My favorite being mango and mint chutney. I can eat it with everything. \n\nThe vast selection of gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan friendly foods makes it a no brain option for when I'm with friends who steer away from meat. The kadhai paneer was one of my favorites, a firm cheese with a mild taste in a curry sauce. Yet meat lovers will not go hungry. The tandoori chicken was cooked to perfection. Nice juicy pieces that were seasoned exceptionally well.  Chicken chilli was probably the best meat dish offered though. The spice is not over powering but strong. Try the rice pudding. \n\nThe only criticisms I have are that certain dishes were either too sweet or too salty. The masala rice needed to be mixed with some basmati. The galub jamun gave me an instant toothache and numbness of the tongue from the sugar overload.   Other than that, I would happily come here again."

We had a friend in from China, and since she likes to eat, we decided on a place where we can try something new, while socializing. We also know that Indian food meets many different dietary wants and needs, and this place has decent reviews and reasonable prices, so we came to Mint. \n\nWe arrived at 7pm to a very clean and modern dining room. The dining area was a little over half full. The clientele seemed very diverse with a mix of cultures and varying levels of dress. \n\nMint easily accommodated our party of 12, which was nice. We had a nice big table and were not cramped, nor did we cramp the other tables around us. The staff seemed friendly enough. However, we were waiting for 2 members of our party to arrive for about 30 minutes, but our waiters never asked for drink or app orders. That wasn't a huge issue, but once we ordered apps and drinks our waiter didn't ask us for our dinner orders for about another 30-45 minutes. We were all engaged in conversation, which I guess could have encouraged the waiter not to ask us. Overall, we were there for 3 hours, and the service was only so so.\n\nThe food was good. The wife and I shared the vegetarian sampler platter. Everything we had was distinctive, flavorful, and delicious. I don't know Indian/Nepalese food too well, so I can't say how authentic it was or was not, but it was pleasing to my palate. We asked for a level 7 spice, but I am pretty sure the waiter did not accommodate that as our food was not too spicy. We like heat, and only one of our dishes had a bit of heat. \n\nI was very impressed with 2 things: 1) The wide selection and friendliness towards vegans and vegetarians. We had more selections than we knew what to do with. I am really excited to go back to Mint just to try some more.\n2) Beer selection: There is a great selection of Indian and European beers here. They range in price from $5-$19 a bottle, but they have selections here I've not seen anywhere else in Vegas. Additionally, they do have a \"beer of the month\" which they sell cheaper than the others. This month the beer is a very good Belgian White (the brand escapes me).\n\nOverall, it was a good experience (other than the service), but I think I will be back."

Mint seats about 60-70, though it feels like a smaller place and even though it's been busy I've only had to wait for a table once.  \n\nThe buffet doesn't seem to change and has a lot of the standard Indian fare.  It's usually kept well stocked and usually things aren't dried out from having sit out too long.  The chicken tikka masala seems a tad watery, but the chicken quality is top notch.  Chicken chili and tandoori chicken are also favorites, along with the masala rice.  \n\nThe service is generally good, mainly because of the smallish size of the place and the fact they seem to have 5 servers running around almost constantly.  That said, there have been a few times I've needed to flag someone down to get more water or the check, though it's not much of a hassle and considering it's a buffet I can't really expect them to fully know when to bring the check.  \n\nThe one real hitch in the buffet service is the delivery of naan.  As soon as you come in the servers generally ask you what type of naan you want (plain, buttered, garlic, maybe some other types?).  A couple of times I have not been asked and had to bring it up myself.  Regardless, I've usually sat down, gone to the buffet, gotten a plate of food, eaten that entire plate of food, and gone up for a second plate before the naan is delivered.  Sometimes I've had the wrong naan delivered as well, though in that case they gave me some plain naan and then later brought the correct garlic naan later with no extra charge.  \n\nThe buffet is $10.99 pre-tax, or $11.88 after tax which is a good value considering the quality and how much everyone likes this place.  They have a normal menu if you aren't there for the lunch buffet and I imagine the food is even better.  They have an \"Inferno\" menu of super spicy items if you're so inclined.  There is also a lassi bar of some sort, though I haven't had it.\n\nI'm on the fence about whether Mint deserves 4 or 5 stars, but considering if I drive by the place and I'm hungry I automatically go there, I'll give it a 5."

The atmosphere is always relaxing to me even though the place has gotten much busier lately and theres a lot of hustle and bustle. The waiters are definitely not on ceremony and I've had the pleasure of the owner sitting down with me when it was nearing closing hours and offering up a cool new beer or wine on the house. The menu has changed twice since I started coming here and it seems to get better and better. I've never seen the ripped booths that was mentioned by a previous reviewer, but perhaps that was fixed up already. I especially like the Swordfish Vindaloo, the Mighty Momos, and my favorite of them all... the Lamb Sekuwa! I've always hated lamb but this is the exception. As a rebuttal to the previous post stating that the owner was doing business on the premises - on two separate occassions I've witnessed the owner Rajan doing business with a wine representative who had brought samples, and in both occassions he ended up doling out wine to his customers and I felt it created a very friendly and congenial atmosphere. True, it may not be professional, but I've never liked the waiters that stand on ceremony and I like this intimate and friendly atmosphere better. In anycase, the food is superb, and I find the wait staff very friendly and knowledgeable. The beers are without compare in Las Vegas - some very hard to find microbrews and foreign brews."

            "review": "Ever since the Mint Yelp event, I've been DYING to come back here but hadn't because of lack of somebody to come here with. My friends are unadventurous eaters and unfortunately, this is a place my family would never eat at because well... for example, my mom's favorite food is saltine crackers and milk.  Anything remotely spiced is shunned and I get a lecture about how I need to be normal and eat stuff the family will eat (read: bland and processed.) Zzzzz.\n\nI've had the mind to walk down and just eat here by myself when I'm at school, but I'm afraid I'd gorge myself on the much talked about goat stew, the delicious gulab jamun and the KILLER tamarind sauce. Seriously, you know how there's that nasty tasting cake called \"better than sex cake?\" Well, if there's a food on this planet that should have the title of \"almost as good as sex,\" this tamarind sauce is the only one that could possibly be a contender - it's crazy delicious.\n\nAfter volunteering at the Las Vegas Rescue Mission on 7/16/11, I needed to grab some food before work because I felt faint, thanks to some vegetable and fruit only fast that I was on. Being a non-vegan, looking for vegan food, I had only one place in mind to go - Mint. \n\nMy sister waited outside while I walked in. After a few minutes of perusing the menu, I noticed that it was laid out differently than it was when I came for the Yelp event - it was much easier to find the vegetarian and vegan options. \n\nI'm supposed to eat only vegetables and fruit on this thing- no dairy, no meat, no nuts, no grains, but, dang it, I was in a hurry and after 5 days of eating dressing-free salads and drinking juiced cucumbers and carrots, I was dying for something filling and flavorful. The meat options all looked killer and I wouldn't mind eating... well anything on the menu. It all sounded great. I settled on potato and pea samosa and a half order of malai kofta with 10 spiciness, hold the rice and the naan. (Less than $10 total.) \n\nThe service was good. I chatted with Smeet about school and work while I waited. He told me the kofta wasn't vegan. At that point, I didn't care. I'd settle for vegetarian for this meal. Friendly service anywhere is always good and in about 15-20 minutes, my food was in my hands and I was out the door. I basically ripped open the container and devoured half of the innards of one of the samosas while simultaneously changing for work in the car. I took the rest with me in to work and chowed down. \n\nUmmmm... the malai kofta was SO good. Maybe I was deliriously hungry or maybe it was just that good. I've been craving more of that kofta like crazy. It was spicy, but not overly so, and had the creamiest texture. It was delicious. How wonderful it is to have something spicy! The remainder of the samosa had the mint and  the ZOMG! tamarind sauce that Smeet included in little containers, poured over them. It was the best thing I'd eaten in almost a week. I wish I had ordered double the amount of food. \n\nWould I go back? YES. As of this writing, I have 8 more days to go on this Vegan thing and I have a feeling I'll hit up Mint at least two more times to grab some more delicious food before I'm done."

There must be over 1,000 different combinations of how you could experience their food so that's one of the main reasons I keep coming back. \n\nWell, that...and the beer selection. You'd be hard pressed to find a more eclectic selection anywhere else. Norse, Belgian, Indian and much more adorn the beer list. But prepare to be occasionally disappointed since they will run out of their more esotheric brews.\n\nBut I digress...getting back to the food. Huge portions (with the option of half portions...score!), multiple vegetarian/vegan options (had the kofta tonight), and delicious naan & roti make this a must stop for me whenever I'm in Vegas.  Try the tikka, biryani or any of the curries and you won't be sorry."

It was pretty pack considering it was late Sunday evening. However, we were able to get a table right away and the food came out fast. They have a huge menu that is also vegan & gluten-free friendly (I guess all Indian food). The menu is well organized and laid out with symbols next to each dish to help the diners that have diet restrictions. Almost every dish can be made into vegan or vegetarian. They also have chicken, tofu, and cheese options. We ordered the onion/cilantra paratha, organic veggie samosas, mighty momos with veggie, chicken tikka masala (Hot level 5-it was not spicy), mixed chef's killer kabob, organic alo gobi masala, monterey jack cheese naan and lastly mango and pistachio kulfi for deserts. Not 1 bad dish. Everything was very good including their chutneys. I do wish they gave more rice since they only gave us 2 small bowls to share between 3 people. They seemed to be reasonbly priced.  Our server, Ronald was great and very helpful. The ambience of the place was nice, too.  It was relaxing and calming. You know it's a good Indian restraunt when it is packed with Indian diners! Overall, we are very happy and can't wait to go back."

We were visiting the museum across the street, got hungry, and thought we would just walk to the strip mall across the way and grab some lunch there. We couldn't even see this place at first, but once we hit the parking lot, we noticed the sign and decided to go in.\n\nWe were there for lunch, which, as others have noted, is a buffet. And, as someone who eats and cooks a LOT of Indian food, I have to say the buffet was super-generous in terms of options and quality. They even had a bin of full-sized idli, which you never / seldom get on the buffet line.\n\nFood was MUCH better than average. The naan was excellent. And, the selections were original and refreshing.\n\nThe service seems meek -- almost like the waitstaff is afraid to talk to you. And, the table service needed to complement the buffet is a bit slow. (Of the two things we needed from the waitstaff, the staff got both items wrong. No biggee, but still noteworthy.)\n\nWe did have a table of some foul-mouthed young men near us who were talking disrespectfully of women. I might have liked it if management had taken care of that for us, but, eventually they did leave."

Um, I may have been back here 20 (or 30) times since then. \n\nThey always start you off with free (and yummy) papadum with mint and tamarind sauces. Their mango lassis are soooo good and the lychee lassi that my husband randomly tried one day was pretty tasty as well. \n\nI'm boring and always order the same thing: saag paneer. Theirs never disappoints, however. And you get lots of paneer which makes me extra happy. We've also had the korma and saffron cauliflower and they are both great as well. I have dreams of the garlic naan. \n\nI would say that the samosas are not so great, and if I was rating this by the buffet only (and the vegetarian food only), I would probably give it 3-stars. Maybe non-veg have a better experience at the buffet, but I'm not sure. \n\nWe wanted to try a new Indian place one Sunday afternoon, but got fed up because they are all closed between the hours of 2-5. So we finally decided to go to our old staple, Mint, for the buffet. We had to laugh because the place was jam packed with Indian customers... we said that all the other restaurants must close to come eat at Mint for a late lunch. \n\nMost days the food is amazing and occasionally it's just good. Some days the \"medium\" spiciness is too mild and sometimes its too hot. But we've never had a bad experience here and the staff are wonderful and very friendly. Definitely give it a try, and seriously... order a mango lassi. \n\nNote: their menu specifically states what items are vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free. They even have vegan lassis! And they also have a great beer selection."

A sign that it was either melted and re-frozen (that has to violate some health codes) or that they did not cook the milk down long enough (lazy cooking).  Also, the Nepali dishes I had were not very good and I know this because I've lived in Nepal.  The momos tasted like they were made with ready made wonton wrappers from the grocery store.  The momo dough isn't quite the same as a wonton wrapper.  The kwati soup did not appear to be made from NINE types of beans/lentils.  It also did not look like the beans/lentils had been sprouted.

Our party of three enjoyed the Garlic Naan, Vegatable Samosas, and the crispy flatbread that was brought to the table was toasted perfectly.  For our mains, we enjoyed chicken tikka masala, lamb biryani, Rogan Josh (with lamb), and I loved loved loved the buttered masala dosa I ordered.  (I had been craving a proper dosa for months!).  Various chutneys were brought to the table as well.  \n\nAll of the items were delivered with good timing, and were all equally delicious with tender chicken and lamb.  At the time of your order you can designate how spicy you'd prefer your meat/curry dishes (on a scale of 1-10).  Our server was hilariously talking us into spicier levels and we were glad we agreed with his recommendations in the end.    We ended with the small dessert offerings of which I can't remember the name but all were lovely and petite, served in tall shotglasses it seemed.  Total bill for three adults with one alcoholic drink and one soda $100 with tax. \n\nMint is definitely a jewel hidden in the Vegas rough, we will be back indefinitely.

Our naan took a rather long time but at least they gave us unlimited garlic naan. \n\nThere's another Indian restaurant a few miles away from here that also has a lunch buffet but that place turned me off when they kept giving me excuses as to why they can't give me garlic naan (i.e. \"We ran out of garlic\" when there's a supermarket right behind them). This place is in a better location and looks nicer and cleaner. The service is better too. For less than $15 for a buffet, you can't go wrong.\n\nI liked that there's a good variety of dishes for their lunch buffet: tikka masala, palak paneer, tofu, veggies, spicy chicken, curry and other savory dishes. Their gulab jamun was just right - hot, sweet and cheesy balls. Yum! The food was excellent. Hooray for huge chunks of chicken! The sauces were spot on. There was this mystery dish that we all tried without reading the label - was it cheese or was it tofu? It was the texture of cubed mozzarella without the stomach ache-inducing property of cheese on somebody who's lactose intolerant. So, it probably was tofu.\n\nI'll definitely come back again and again."

When we arrived, every table was full and the manager expressed that he thought the reservation was for 8:30. I pulled up the email and he apologized profusely. They seated us to the side with menus while they figured out where to put us. The manager continuously apologized and we were seated within 20 minutes of our reservation, with drinks (which we ordered while we were waiting) and papadum arriving quickly. \n\nMy husband is still coming to terms with Indian food (he was convinced he hated it when what he really dislikes is curry, so he's been slowly discovering things that aren't curry), so we ordered the Indian sampler to give him the widest range of options. At least one other reviewer suggested that this wasn't enough food for two, but we found it to be more than worthwhile. True, there were no leftovers, but that isn't what we were expecting. The tray is artfully presented. Each item comes in its own small, circular metal container with naan in the center and extra rice on the side. The containers are easy to pick up, which is really useful when sharing. There isn't really enough naan for two, but our second order came out fast and warm.\n\nEverything expect the vegetable curry was a little mild for my taste, but that was the price I paid for sharing with someone who asked for medium.\n\nI had the lychee rum lassi. I really like the idea of alcoholic lassis, but the lychee flavor was a little mild. I think I'll start with a stronger base flavor next time. Lychee was too delicate.\n\nI had the lunch buffet a while ago and came back based on that. It was definitely worth it.\n\nThey did rush us out without be drink menu I asked for after we finished our khir, but when I saw the grandmas in saris sitting outside in a line about five tables deep, I decided that my darjeeling would be just as good brewed at home. They were apparently the place to be on Christmas Eve."

The dhal was absolutely loaded with flavor and spice. I love that Indian food (when done right) doesn't even need meat. Next time I will order veg masala because the flavor was such that meat was totally not needed. The service was fast, friendly, and attentive.

We asked our waiter if he had any suggestions and he said yes I recommend any of the samplers.He told us it was more then enough food for two people. So we ordered one of the samplers and an order of samosas for our appetizer. It took over 30 mins to get our food and once we did it was barley enough food for one. The food was dry and very bland. We asked our waiter about the samosas and he said he had already given them to us, Turns out he gave them to the table behind us. He had to re-order them for us. The manager ended up giving us the samosas for free. We left this place hungry and ended up going to Mcdonalds on the way home. I will never go to this place again and do not recommend it to anyone.

The place was decorated in black and grays that gave it a chic feel.  The service was awesome and our water glasses were never empty.

The location is kinda weird, in a small strip mall with a close proximity to Jack in the Box's dump. Once you get inside, though it's tr\u00e8s chic. Clean and modern, with funky art hung up on the walls. \n\nFor appetizers we had the garlic naan with makhani sauce and the organic samosas, along with some lassis to drink. I had the mango rum and my friend had the lychee rum. The mango was thick from the puree and yoghurt, and a little too strong from the rum, but good overall. The lychee one was perfect! Both the  naan and samosas were delicious, but the garlic naan was my favorite, and the spicy makhani sauce : )\n\nThe entrees we went with were the veggie tikka masala (8/10 spicy) and lamb vindaloo (10/10 spicy) with basmati rice. The veggies were perfectly cooked, the lamb was tender and flavorful. Sauce was well seasoned, and the spice definitely matched the level. 10/10 had my nose running, but it's all good, the pain let's me know I'm alive hahaha. I'm gonna need to train if I'm gonna try the inferno curry challenge (which according to the server is at a 110/10. Basmati was ok, but next time I'm getting extra garlic naan to have with my meal. \n\nDESSERT! We were fat kids and ordered 6 of the mini desserts, because they were sold out of the 7th one. So! We got the Khir (rice pudding), Gulab Jamun (milk based pastry steeped in syrup), Pistachio and Mango Kulfi (ice cream), Mango Custard, and Gajar Halwa (carrot pudding [like, steamed pudding, not jello]). All so good, even after stuffing our faces with food prior. The gajar halwa and gulab jamun were too sweet for me, though. \n\nGreat first experience for me, I'll be back!"

Even though the restaurant says that dinner starts at 3 pm, they made us wait for a good 25 min outside in the hot torrid Vegas weather because the servers were cleaning..However,  the non-vegetarian dinner for two that we ordered was extremely filling. The rice kheer offered as dessert was simply yummy."

I will say the food is much better this time around. I brought my family and we tried several dishes and everything was great. \nI ate there again yesterday and still consistently great.\n\nOH almost forgot. they offer a good amount of vegan options and organic ingredients.

(Though to be fair, being understated is easy to do in a city full of flashing lights and incessant beeping)  \nSure, we waited a bit, but it was Saturday night.  The food more than made up for it.  \nWe had a sampler platter, which came with garlic Nan, delicious tandoori chicken, daal, biryani, and yogurt.  Everything was prepared with delicacy and care, and as a regular consumer of Indian food, I was more than pleased with the quality.  \nNext time I go back, I will have to try out some of the Nepalese selections available.

It was good and all but I needed my rice, so I got rice haha The last thing we had gotten was tandoori chicken. I had asked around and I was told that this is the thing to get! It was a litte dry for me so I ended up dipping and rolling the chicken around in the korma curry. The portions were big! OH! all this food was for six people haha I plan on coming again. And the big plus is that I did not smell like Indian food when I left which is a really really big plus!

They are signature entrees. \n\nThe mango masala has fresh vegetables with mango chunks that are cooked in an onion/fennel-seed base. I get it with the chicken ($16.99), but you can also get it with the lamb ($18.99). It is served with long grain white rice.\n\nThe Andhra Curry is a spicy curry mixed with coconut milk. It is very favorable with it's combination of spices. I think this dish is best with lamb ($15.99) but have also had it with chicken ($15.99).

So many mixtures of spices floating in the air! \n\nWe were served our water one at room temp and the other with ice. We ordered, and had our food maybe 15-20 mins later. \n\nRecommending their Chicken Tikka Masala (Roasted Chunks of Chicken in a creamy, spiced, orange colored sauce), Chicken Tindoori (Yogurt Marinated and seasoned with spice mixture), Garlic-Butter Naan (somewhat like pita bread), Biryani Rice. It was enough to feed my family of four though we had to order another two orders of the Butter-Garlic Naan. It was just that good! \n\nWe also ordered the Raita sauce which is yogurt based to cool the spiciness of the chicken tindoori for my mom who doesn't like spicy food. It definitely did what it's supposed to but the taste was nothing to go crazy over. I've tasted better from other places. \n\nOne star deducted for how non attentive the servers where when we were there. They only came to our table when one of us flagged them down and never did they just check up on us throughout our meal. \n\nAs for the place, clean looking, very spacious, dimmed lights to make the place more intimate and music to portray the the desired ambiance of the place. \n\nWill be back!"

Since I didn't want to have Indian food that I could eat anywhere else, I opted to try something from Tibet or Nepal. Since their lunch specials were mostly Indian, I ordered from the menu. \n\nThe Tibetan/Nepalese section was rather sparse in comparison to the Indian section and chose one of two vegan options. I ordered the Chau Chau which was a flavorful blend of noodles and vegetables with chili paste. The dish was pretty good though I wish there was more variety than just noodles and was happy that I chose the half order which was sufficient enough to fill my stomach and left me craving for dessert. The half order was similarly priced as the lunch special. They offered one vegan dessert option which was absolutely amazing. I tried the Gajar Haluwa which is a carrot \"pudding\" that consisted of carrots chopped up very small and sweetened by its own juices mixed with raisins. Apparently nuts were also in the \"pudding\" though I didn't see any. Their red tea peach iced tea was also delicately sweetened and refreshing for the hot weather. \n\nThe atmosphere is alright. It is a lot more casual than it looks on their website. Their right wall is under construction pending a Lassi bar and they use paper napkins instead of fancy napkins. I can only hope that the Lassi bar will include some non-dairy options!"

Also I have been here before so I know the portions and have been served by this same waiter. \n\nOn this visit, I ordered the mango lassi; garlic naan; chicken tikka masala; andhra curry. Mango lassi is still my favorite in town. I still don't understand why the garlic naan is not cut so when it comes out piping hot I have to wait a bit to actually tear it apart. The chicken in the tikka masala was dry even though it is buried in a cream sauce. The Indian spices in the andhra curry are overpowering to where you cannot taste the coconut milk or the fresh veggies. \n\nThe lack of attention to detail paired with the uncomfortable environment gives MINT two stars."

Lunch buffet, I was told they will charge 1/2 price for my 5 year old. When the bill came it was a full price $12.99. I told them so they fixed it to  $8.99..... What's is half price of $12.99?! Not $8.99 for sure... Do not order Mango Lassi unless you are looking for full of color n sugar!"

They have Indian and Nepalese food. Their imported drink menu was very extensive. The decor is above average for an Asian restaurant. Their booths are cozy and would be great for a date.

I knew it's not and still couldn't shake it off... \n\nBut I have to say the food was great! We ordered a variety of things - garlic naan, tomato soup, potato samosas, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken and chicken biryani. Everything was very flavorful, unique and tasty. Personally I didn't like the biryani that much, reminded me of kids rice with tomato sauce. But my friends loved it so I guess it's just me.\n\nWe ordered a lot and left with leftovers that we took home. Don't order so much it may look small but it's a lot! Also the chicken dishes came with rice. \n\nService was good, the manager came to ask how's everything and my friend told him that the naan didn't have enough Garlic and salt, so he brought us more on the house. It was very nice of him.  \n\nI would recommend if you want Indian food."

They were not quite as crispy and bursting with flavor as the ones I remember from my early years In South Africa, but would definitely have them again.\nOrdered the lamb Karma Korma for the entree. I asked for the mild spice, since i don't normally like the really hot dishes, but I probably could have gone with the medium spice. Flavors were well blended with a hint of sweetness. Accompanied it with a side of garlic naan, perfect for mopping up the left over sauce.\nI'll definitely come back again when I'm in town."

            "review": "I yelped and I googled and I yelped when I was in the process of purchasing a voucher from Restaurant.com . The foods was great but not for the money.\n\nThis is my first time I tried Rest voucher. I took a friend with me. It was definitely a lot less valuable as Groupon (from what I've gathered, there was Groupon offered at this restaurant recently). Groupon imposed no conditions on money spent (I assume you ordered $40 foods or more with your $20 purchase, then you paid the tax and tips on top, for a minimal of $23.24). Rest voucher dictated you ordered twice as much and paid 18% tip, plus tax. For $25 voucher (you may pay $15 for it), you have to order $45 min of food. So the final total was about $49. What's my saving? If I've got the voucher for free, I still paid about $33. How much is my saving then? If I order the foods without the voucher, I would have paid about $49 too. What's wrong with this picture.\n\nWith this irritation aside, the foods were good. Not excellent, but tasty. I was surprised with a one-page Nepalese section. I have never tried Nepalese foods before. And I don't consume east Indian foods often. So we ordered Nepalese sampler $29.99 and a Tandouri chicken $14.99. There was also a Indian sampler for $30.99 available.\n\nThe portion on the sampler was so small (2 oz per metal cup) that I could easily finish by myself and still feel hungry. It came with 4 pieces of turkey dumpling, 2 oz red curry chicken (4 cubes), 2 oz vegetarian, 4 small pieces of skewed lamb (in 2 oz cup), 2 oz broth, 2 oz cucumber salad, 2 servings of 2 oz steamed rice, 3 small pieces of brown desserts, and one cut up Naan. Luckily we had Tandouri chicken to contribute a small space in our stomach; it came with 5 small pieces of thighs and drumstick with plenty of onions. I have to be honest, I don't have a fine palate for Indian cuisine. The Nepalese foods tasted like Indian foods.\n\nEven though it tasted good, but I had similar or better at various cities. A meat sampler costs $12.99 and Tandouri chicken $8.99 during a visit to Flagstaff (I thought it was a bit pricey at the time comparing to the restaurant in SoCal excluding San Diego).\n\nThe service was plain ordinary. I can hardly understand our server's thick accent. I wound never have paid 18% tips on this kind of service.\n\nThe location was off the strip but in the midst of Asian commercial district. There were many Indian and some Filipino restaurants in the neighborhood.\n\nSo diners, beware what you are getting from Restaurant.com voucher. It feels like a scam to benefit the restaurants. Groupon is a better deal here. I feel the price is at least 50% more than other places, regardless Vegas charm or not. I won't be back for there is no knowledge gain but a bad overall experience and the worse value I have ever had for a long time."

The place was clean and ambiance was fitting. We had a coupon that we bought on restaurant.com and that is what our deciding factor for this establishment.  \n\nThe service was polite and friendly.  No complaints in that department.  \n\nThe menu was substantial, but as I get older I find that places with such a large menu yet tiny place, often miss the mark when it comes to execution of full flavor of their items. (Due to waste control, they need to be able to mix quickly.) We had the equivalent of the chicken masala and it was way sweeter than anything I have ever had.  The sauce reminded me of the Indian tomato soups that I have had, in both texture and flavor.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I had expected based on my past experiences at other Indian restaurants.  Also, despite ordering it spicy and requesting it be an 8, it was very mild. We ordered the garlic naan and could hardly taste any garlic. \n\nI ordered a Mango Lassi to go and it was okay.  A bit heavy on the yogurt.  I prefer my Lassi drinks lighter/less thick. \n\nAll in all, not so bad but I just wasn't wowed at all."

The crowd was extremely young and the place was lively. The decor was okay with muted sounds of Indian cinema music in the background. The menu was very innovative -- almost every appetizer and entree had a twist. We are vegetarian and so this review won't help if you are looking to hear about the chicken tikka masala (which I am told is good...). \n\nSo, we ordered the Organic Samosa and vegetable pakoras. We also ordered the mahakali mango masala (yes that is the real name), Dal Maharani Balti, and the Hariyali Kabab. After a long day of gallivanting, we were hungry and would have eaten anything cooked :-)\n\nFor the food then... While the names were innovative, the food not so much. The Hariyali Kabab was green (as expected), but was bland. The chutneys were basted on a bit too much and there was literally no spice. The Mahakali Mango Masala was similarly taste free and bland. We had ordered this with paneer and it was undercooked. The Dal wasn't bad and probably the only item that was tasty enough. The breads, on the other hand, were fresh and nice.\n\nAlso there were a lot of innovative lassi types. These were very nice as well. \n\nPerhaps the items with meat were better and the crowd was generally having a lot of fun! So, we might have been the unlucky group. This place is definitely worth a visit just to see the creativity in the menu."

This is one of the few Indian places that nails it down on quality, taste, service, ambiance and price!\n\nWent here for a weekend lunch buffet. Priced at $12.99/person, it is unbeatable good quality Indian food (you could tell by the sheer number of Indian folks eating here and the long queue of those waiting to get a table). The buffet had a varied collection of items including appetizers, salads, four veg, four non veg curries, rice and dessert. Some top show stoppers were Vegetable Korma, Paneer, Idli Sambar, Veg Pakoras, Bhelpuri and Naan. Food was flavourful, hot and fresh (unlike many places where dishes just keep sitting for long on buffet racks). Each curry tasted authentic, distinct from another and cooked to perfection. Also tried their Masala Tea (not included in the buffet) and it was good.\n\nService was fast, attentive and friendly and this is despite the rush on a busy Saturday afternoon.  Decor is simple yet pleasing to the eyes.\n\nFor those of you, who might be tempted to try many other low priced Indian buffets in town (mostly at $9 or $10), trust me this one might be a little pricey but it is top value for your dollar. This place serves delicious food and has great ambiance & service!\n\nTip: Lunch hour gets real crowded on Sat & Sun, so ditch the long waiting time (sometimes upto 30-35 mins for a table inside and 20 mins for an outside seating) by making it for an early lunch. Also, if you are not used to having Indian food, this could prove to be a little on the spicy side for you.  \n\nSo what could improve? This is for the restaurant owner/ management/ staff:\n\n1. Do away with those paper cup glasses. They look cheap and take away the charm from the entire food experience.\n2. Including a drink in the buffet like Tea or Mango Lassi can help you beat the competition that comes at a similar price."

I had stopped down the street at India Masala for Dosa Tuesday, only to find out their chef quit and they're no longer serving South Indian food. So I left and came here.\n\nFirst thing that caught my eye was one their first page of the menu, inferno naan. YESSSS please. We were asked to sign a consent prior to ordering. What the? Made with ghost peppers and habanero chills, it came out looking so plain, but when you open up the naan, it was loaded with peppers.  I took one bite, it was horrid. I love spicy food, but I like a good taste with the spice. This was pure nastiness. I had to spit it out. My nose, lips and tongue immediately started burning, thankfully I had a full lassi in front of me that cooled down the heat. \n\nOnto the next one. I was excited to see that they served Northern and Southern Indian food. I ordered my favorite, Mysore Masala Dosa, red chili chutney and potatoes, and onions. This was by far the best dosa I have ever had. The chutney served with it was really good as well. \n\nWe also ordered the lamb kabobs, these were nice and tender, great flavor too. Of course we had to order cheese naan, every americans favorite. I love naan. I could eat it for days.\n\nThe most exciting thing tho, they have a lassi bar! I tried the mango and rose lassi (two, don't judge). I love a good mango lassi. I've never seen a place have a lassi bar, there were so many different flavors to choose from. I will most likely be trying all of them. \n\nI like this place, a lot. Good Indian food. I like that they serve both cuisines. Kinda like when you go to a Thai place and you can get Northern and Southern style. I like options."

The place is pretty small and the buffet area seems small, but the selection is decent. If you know me at all, you'll know that the first thing I look for is Butter Chicken. A quick scan of the lineup reveals a disappointing no. So right off the bat, this puts them at a disadvantage against Namaste.\n\nThen I found the Goat Curry. At an Indian buffet, I really only need one go-to item and luckily, the Goat Curry was off the hook! It's not quite the Naan heaven that is Butter Chicken, but paired with rice, I enjoyed every morsel.\n\nAs for the Naan, I like how they bring it out to order. This can lead to moments of Naan-less agony, but at least you know it's always warm and fresh when it comes to your table.  The Garlic Naan has an overpowering aroma and is the only way to fly.\n\nI haven't tried any of their Lassis, but that will definitely change today at the CMYE. I love me some Mango Lassi, but the other flavors are intriguing.\n\nOverall, I'm definitely a fan of this place. Quite honestly, I'd pick Namaste over Mint for one simple reason (which should be easy to deduce by now). Still, Mint is a solid lunch buffet choice.\n\nEDIT: I've since been back and I'm not sure why I thought the buffet area is small. There are quite a few dishes from which to choose. I guess it's because I only found a couple of items that interested me."

We had the chicken tikka masala which was amazing, the salad with tandoori chicken, na'an bread and the chicken tandoori. Every single dish was absolutely amazing, the whole family agreed on 5 stars. There were multiple people coming around to refill drinks and get you anything else you may need, the owner came by multiple times to make sure everything was great, just as he promised it would be. This is a must try for people just visting from out of town or the locals, just east of the strip (Las Vegas Blvd)."

The menu is extensive: Northern, Southern Indian with Himalayan foods offered, as well. I asked for his help in navigating the menu and he guided us brilliantly.

            "review": "A year ago we visited and I thought, \"It's okay, but there are too many places I like better.\" This summer, finally taking heed of the restaurant's \"You Yelped. We Listened.\" comment, we came back.\n\nAnd back. And back.\n\nThis review only covers the lunch buffet as I've yet to make it out for dinner, but don't think I don't have my eye on that Paneer Makhani.\n\nSpeaking of paneer, it's my thing. I like pakoda/pakora, dal, aloo anything, and malai kofta, but what gets me on my feet and the car keys in my hand is the promise of paneer in a creamy sauce.\n\nOh, but it can't be sag or palak paneer. I've got a spinach issue. (It's what keeps me off the Galactic Council of Vegetarians.) And muttar paneer (peas and cheese) is nice, but everyone does that. My bar is set above that and getting higher all the time.\n\nAnd Mint has met the challenge. Every visit this summer has been met with a different creamy-sauced paneer dish. Sometimes a tikka masala, sometimes something I've never heard of. And when there is a spinach-y paneer, there's still a non-spinach option as well.\n\nI'm going to buy a choir robe just so it looks less weird when I walk the Mint buffet line shouting \"Hallelujah!\" \n\nIn addition to the paneer is the fresh salad offerings (fruit, chutney, raita, the usual), vegetable pakoda, lentils, and then a few surprises. I try everything because nothing has let me down yet. Oh, except for the meat, but my husband has that covered. You can probably hear him \"Mmmm!\"ing across the restaurant. (And maybe across the street at the Atomic Museum on the days they serve chicken pakoda.)\n\nFlavour was an issue with me a year ago. Mint's taste was strong and samey to me, not clearly made with a careful hand. Good, but not as great as other places. But now? It's easy to savour every bite, and I find myself so, so, SO sad when I'm full. \"But the party is still going on!\" my mouth says, but my tummy draws a velvet rope and suggests that next time maybe I eat less naan.\n\n(But the naan is so soft and garlicky! You can have plain naan as well, but this is one of the few places where I really enjoy the garlic naan and don't find it a little acrid/burnt.)\n\nFor dessert, there's always (at least when we've visited) gulab jamun. If I were a mad scientist with preteen fashion sense, I'd freeze-dry a ball of gulab jamun and wear it around my neck to show my love for this fragrant, rosy dessert. The syrup at Mint is airy but strong, and the spheres are porous and squishy, just how I like it.\n\nService is always hospitable and swift. I especially dig the carafes of ice water on each table, the condensation a pretty sight on a hot Las Vegas day.\n\nIt has taken me two months to write this review because I can't start thinking about Mint without finding myself driving across town for a reasonably priced lunch. This time, armed with a full stomach, I have made it to the end of the review.... but I think I know where we're going for dinner."

This trip was different.\nWe all were excited to see so many options of different types of indian food, and tried the following:\n\nchau chau noodles with veggies-This was yummy despite the taste of tomato ketchup in it. really yummy actually. \nSchezwan fried rice-good\ndal makhani-yumm\nsaag with paneer-flavorful \ncheese naan, naan and tandoori roti were fresh and crisp\n\nThe only downside was the fact that the portion sizes are quite small for the price.

They had a good variety of both vegetarian and meat dishes, including chicken korma.  They make some of the best around, great flavor, creamy sauce.\n\nMy fellow diners also loved the lunch buffet, one even exclaimed \"if all vegetarian food tasted this good\" he'd be a vegetarian!\n\nBuffet includes tandoori chicken and a lamb dish and they bring warm Naan bread to your table.\n\nThey also have an extensive drink menu- large selection of Indian and Belgian beers as well as specialty cocktails.\n\nThis is a definite \"WILL RETURN\" spot!"

We both love Indian food, so Mint seemed like the right choice. \n\nI was first pleased to see that we were the only folks there that didn't appear to be of Indian ancestry, my personal good sign indicator for ethnic fooderies. I was also pleased to see that it was pretty packed, but there was no wait to be seated. The decor was simple and elegant, with lots of blond wood and high backed booths. \n\nService was spectacular, we had at least 5 very attentive and polite servers. They kept us up to date on the progress of each course, made sure our water was cold and plentiful, and inquired about our enjoyment. \n\nThe menu was extensive, with both Himyl and Indian dishes. There was a lot of creativity involved, but the old standbys were also delish. I also liked that the menu let diners know what was veggie/vegan friendly.** Say yes to the samosas my friends. They are the best I have had.** All dishes were at a fair price, and I really liked that you could order half-dishes at a reduced cost. This was especially important when you have no microwave in your hotel, and you were taught not to waste food. Me and the BF were really pleased with our dishes, and two half plate entrees were more than enough food to share and be stuffed--but not too stuffed due to the half portions. I may also have to mention that they serve Frambois, and I would cut someone to have that delicious fizzy nectar. \n\n\nThis is the place that inspired me to Yelp. I knew after seeing a Yelp approved sticker in the window, that these reviews actually make an impact. Yelpers, you got gooooood taste. \nSo, thank you fellow Yelpers on leading us here, and thanks Mint for being so rad."

I'm fond of smorgasbord buffets too, but there's something about just Indian food or just Chinese food or just Mexican food, and endless amounts of it, that make my heart go pitter patter (in an excitement way and a high blood pressure and cholesterol way). So when in a panic of needing Indian food and needing it now, I met my girl Jaime W for some AYCE yums. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were given menus. \"WTF FOR?!?\" I thought. It turns out that in addition to their delicious lunch buffet, they have a hefty selection of drinks, alcoholic and non. Next time. \n\nI started off wrong by getting a small plate instead of the bigass one necessary for all Indian food pursuits. It didn't take me long to fill it up. I did not care for the green salad--too peppery--but hey, that's the beauty of the buffet. Chutneys all were so winning, especially combined with any of the other various items on the buffet. You can't go wrong with mango chutney and paneer tikka masala, amirite? \n\nThe menu is SuperMenu, so clearly marked for anybody with dietary restrictions. My only dietary restriction is having only one stomach so I'm not concerned about vegetarian/vegan/gluten free but if that's your bag, here's your place. I also like how there are menu suggestions and they let you know that some things are desserts (except those little donuts. Those are marked wrong, they are for every course). \n\nDefinitely will come back for the dinner menu and for the buffet again. Can't complain about a thing."

They do offer a few unique dishes I don't see at any other Indian buffet like their version of lo mein, chaat and 3 kinds of naan and soup.  I just prefer the overall selection a little more at other places."

            "review": "I've always wanted to check this place out but never knew where it was until I passed it while we were on our way to Mob Month at the library. I definitely wanted to try it so I kept a mental note for after the lecture. \n\nWe started off with drinks I had the Rose Lassi. The rose flavor was really delicate ..it  didn't taste like I was consuming a rose garden. My husband had the Pomegranate Martini. He thought it was a little strong and so did I but I don't think that taste can be avoided when you are mixing juice with Vodka. I've had a Martini made with Baileys before ....I think that's more my speed. I don't think it was a true Martini but the taste is much smoother. \n\nI ordered the half order of Lamb Biryani $9.99. It was good but while I was eating it I came across some very strong spices. You know the feeling when you accidentally bite into a peppercorn..it felt like that but I'm not sure what type of spice it was. It looked like a miniature piece of a tree branch but the tender lamb made up for it. \n\nMy husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad $5.99. The seasonal veggies that came with salad were super fresh. Good size cucumbers tomatoes, and chicken ...beautiful colors. It tasted good too! It's perfect for a late night snack that will not weigh you down. It tasted even better when you put some of the salad on the Naan and roll it up. My husband agreed that I know what I'm talking about it because he liked it . That's no easy feat. \n\nWe wanted to try some dessert so I ordered the Mango Kulfi. It's basically a milky mango ice cream. It's not sour like a sorbet... it was pretty tasty. My husband went out of his vanilla box of his basic dessert choices .... he also had no choice because there is no ice cream sundaes here! He ordered the Lal Mohan which looked kind of like like juicy brown eggs. I thought the he might be scared off by it but he tried it and like it. I tried some too . If you are the type that doesn't like too much syrup on your french toast then this may not be for you. I'm one of those people. These are milk based pastries drowning in syrup. It was cool trying something new though. \n\nThe service was awesome ! Our waiter helped us decide on the desserts . He genuinely cared what we thought of the food...which was refreshing.  The waiter had a nice warm personality where when he said \"Hope you come back soon\" ...you have to believe him!"

Came here another 3x, and the lunch buffet is not only an amazing value but likely the best Indian food I've ever had and definitely the best Indian lunch buffet! \n\nFor me, that statement is saying a lot considering I was first exposed to the wonderful world of Indian cuisine at restaurants located along Lexington Ave in Murray Hill, NYC aka \"curry hill\" and via the Indian ethnic enclave of Jackson Heights near the 74th Street stop in Queens. \n\nThe diversity of NYC and its eclectic cuisine is undoubtedly one of things I miss most about it but that is a whole other story...glad we have Mint in Vegas!"

When we first arrived there was only one other party within an hour the place was packed. Lucky restaurant apparently bad for us.\n\nThings we dined on\n\nGarlic Naan 4/5\nA little too crispy for dipping in my entree broth but still good.\n\nVeggie Kofta 3/5\nLacking flavor although the kofta had the right texture.\n\nPlain Dosa 4/5\nMassive in size check out my photos. Dosa tasted great but the coconut chutney was probably the worst i've tasted. \n\nSaag paneer 1/5\nLacking more flavor then the kofta, do they not season the food at all?...\n\nLime Soda 1/5\nSuppose to be fresh squeezed limes, you could clearly taste that it was not.\n\nRose Lassi 2/5\nNever tried a rose lassi before although I love mango and mint lassi's and I love rose ice cream and yogurt. Not what I was expecting.\n\nService was terrible took 45 minutes to get us our drinks alone then our order was taken add another 40 mins. No I am not kidding, I remember this like yesterday although it was almost 3 weeks ago. This was a very stressful dining experience for my friend and I. A not so pleasant way for us to spend our last few hours in Vegas.  I will not be returning when back in Vegas."

            "review": "I was excited to eat at this restaurant. But, honestly the food was just okay. I opted for the Pre-Fixed menu because according to Mint Indian Bistro, these dishes are supposedly their most 'popular' dishes. I was disappointed by the soup starter. I had two scoops of it and was done with it. The fried veggie appetizer was decent,  but nothing great. \n\nThen the entrees came. The two meat dishes were good. I believe one was a chicken dish, the other was the lamb. The other vegetable entrees were forgettable and bland. The rice was plain and nothing to brag about. And I chose the garlic naan, which was dry. They don't brush it with any ghee to add an extra layer of flavor. Just chopped garlic on a dry naan. \n\nThe dessert was almost inedible. I chose the round 'doughnut' hole thing that was swimming in a pool of butter and something sweet, maybe it was honey, which in theory sounds pretty good, but it's like eating a soggy sock soaked in sweet butter. After spending $65 with tip (had a $5 indian beer), I felt like I was massively ripped off. Also, if you are hungry, the portions for the pre-fixed for two is quite small, in my opinion.\n\nI've honestly had much better indian food in Hawaii. If anyone ever visits Oahu island. There is a small hole in the wall called Cafe Maharani. The food is amazing, but just keep in mind the wait can be horrendous, so call in your name (to put you on the list as you make your way there) or order take out to avoid the (often) 2 hour wait. My favorite dishes are the Chicken Marsala, Shrimp Do Piazza, Cheesy Garlic Naan, well any Naan. The saffron rice. Well, any of their flavored rice. And, any of their creamy lamb dishes. \n\nI was also super bummed that our server was inattentive. Our water glasses went empty for a significant amount of time in between the meal and each set of food app/entrees/desserts were delivered by the bus boys. Our server only took our order and then brought our check. \n\nThey were slightly busy, but no where near a 2 hour wait. There was only one party waiting to be seated when we were leaving, so I just felt like more effort could have been made to providing better service."

This review is for the lunch buffet.\n\nThere were many items in the buffet line, ranging from vegetarian to meat courses. \n\nThe quality and taste of the dishes exceed my expectations even more now.  I love goat karahi.  I have been to many Indian restaurants where the goat karahi isn't consistent.  I know I can count on Mint to make sure that each piece is tender and flavorful.  I mixed my tender chunks of goat meat with slices of onions and cucumbers, then squeezed lemon on them and tossed it around some more. It was delicious, and the naan was great as well.  \n\nHowever, goat karahi wasn't the only star on today's menu (according to me, of course).  I have tried tandoori chicken at many places, but I find it lacks flavor.  When Debbie said that the tandoori chicken is her favorite, I decided to grab a piece to give it a try.  Boy was I glad Debbie raved about it.  It was SOOOOO GOOOOD!  I tore off a piece of this delicious chicken that bursted with flavor and put it on top of freshly baked garlic naan. I then dipped it into the tamarind chutney and wala, yummy-in-my-tummy.  \n\nI was full at this point, but still had to eat my favorite dessert, khir.  I was super excited to see this in the  buffet line.  I love the basmati rice, slow cooked in milk with a dash of cardamom.  I got two servings, one for Roland, and one for myself.  Somehow, they both ended up being consumed by me...Oops...Khir...I can't help myself.\n\nI also had the Lal Mohan.  Again, tried this at other places, never liked it.  Luckily, Debbie also raved about this so I gave it a shot...thank goodness I tried it because it is DELICIOUS.\n\nAnd the staff, attentive and friendly, as always."

I actually stopped coming here because I felt there was a lack of selection and no variety (always the same buffet items). The last time I came here was in the Summer of 2013. We were driving by and hungry and a what-the-hell moment ensued. We went to Mint for the first time in almost a year.\n\nClearly lots has improved, and I am a huge fan. The Mt.

My co-workers wanted to squeeze it into our lunch hour, so we hurried over for the $12.99 lunch buffet, offered 11am-4pm daily.\n\nMy first impression was that the buffet line isn't the biggest, but it still had plenty to offer. Clean plates and bowls are in the back corner near the salad, sauces, and soups. Vegetarian options are next if you follow the line down, and meat dishes (mostly chicken) are nearest to the seating area.\n\nThe food was quite impressive overall. Carbs from the Vegetable Fried Rice and the Vegetable Chau Chau, a soft noodle dish that their web site states to be from Tibet. The veggie Pakoda were a nice fried treat that didn't seem too greasy. Goat curry was tender enough and tasty, if a bit annoying to eat with all the bones. Pretty much everything chicken was yummy, but the tandoori chicken is most likely the best, moistest version of it that I've had - and it's at a lunch buffet. Don't forgot to grab the veggies served on that tray either. Finally, don't forget the decadent gulab jamun for dessert. They're kinda like wet/soft, sugary, soaked donuts, and they're served very hot here.\n\nThe negatives weren't that much of an issue for me, but I have to mention that the service was very spotty. We were through eating our first plates by the time that they brought out the water, and considering that a couple of dishes are mildly spicy, it would've been nice to have relief earlier. The garlic naan took even longer - even considering that they tasted freshly cooked, you'd think that they'd just keep pumping them out during lunch rush. Even the check took a couple of minutes to arrive after we finally flagged someone down, and we ended up walking to the register to pay.\n\nAlso, the naan were the one food that I had a quibble with. Although they were crispy, flaky, and served hot, they were undersalted if eaten alone.\n\nI wish I hadn't had my first meal at Mint Indian Bistro during a rushed lunch hour, but it was still delicious. I'd say it's fine if you have at least 45 minutes, not accounting for drive time. If I catch the Indian food bug, Mint would definitely be on my rotation."

It has since been removed to the side of counter but no biggie. At least it is still there :) The food, of course, is great! We always get the organic somosa, veggie pokoda, and a masala dosa. Always hot, fresh, and good. Make this a spot on your list if you are going to Las Vegas."

Mint has a lovely environment where every time we go in they remember us and greet us like we're family. They ask us about our kids and really make the experience feel special. The chicken tiki and the Dosa are the best, strongly recommend it. \nOh and they have the ac on during the summer! (We have been to a few Indian restaurants that do not turn their ac on!)"

We had the Lamb Kurma, Tandori Chicken, and several folks in my party had the \"all-you-can-eat\".

It was a Himalayan restaurant, and now it's Indian restaurant. The decor inside is very basic. Moss green walls, some black iron pieces on the walls but was largely devoid of cultural ambiance that I particularly like in ethnic restaurants. I feel like decor really adds to an experience, it makes it feel authentic. This place didn't really have that. It was new, so maybe that's why it was so sparsely decorated. I took someone here because they never tried Indian before, so we just ordered the Indian Sampler. The Indian Sampler had about pint sized versions of coconut curry vegetables, lamb vindaloo, chicken masala, lentils, tandoori chicken, yoghurt, kheer, and one other that I can't remember. It was accompanied by 2 pieces of sliced garlic naan and basmati rice. The coconut curry veggies were fantastic, the flavors were excellent. The lamb vindaloo was good, not great. Not as spicy as i'm used to, but not bad. The tandoori chicken was kind of a joke,  it looked like two cornish game hen legs. So micro chicken legs, I thought that looked horrible.  We ordered lychee lassi and mango lassi, and for whatever reason I was served lukewarm mango lassi. I've never received lassi that wasn't cold, so it was a little different for me since the lychee lassi was served over ice. The service was good, no complaints on that. The owner chatted with us a little and was friendly. All in all, it was okay. It wasn't great, the price points are lower than Origin India, so i'd go back if I wanted to pay something a little more moderate. The experience was fun, nothing mind blowing. Origin India just blows it out of the water as far as the quality of the food and ambiance though, so i'd much rather go there if I had a choice."

NOTE:  They have many new items on the menu and they continue to have their original items.\n\nThe first page of the new menu is the Inferno menu.  All dishes on this page are made with ghost peppers.  You have to sign a waiver before eating from this menu our server RS told us.  There's one challenge that if you finish, you get your photo on their Wall of Fame and you get a $50 Mint gift card for future use.  I don't think it's accepted by any hospitals.  (Michael K, this might be something you'd want to try!)\n\nIn addition, the new menu has soups and salads and appetizers of various kinds.  There are so many things to try it seems like a good UYE with 5 or 6 people to share the items.\n\nFor tonight, I chose the Vertical Vindaloo with lamb.  The menu change also allows you to order vindaloo and choose the protein you want--cheese, lamb, veggies, goat (bone in), swordfish, shrimp--and you choose your spiciness from 1 to 10.  I chose \n7 and I could have had more spice.  8 or 9 next time.  My wife ordered the Maharaja Tikka Masala with chicken breast (again choice of protein similar to the vindaloo).  She chose a spiciness of 3.  We also got an order of buttered garlic naan.\n\nEverything was excellent!  The vindaloo had good spicy flavor and the sauce was very flavorful.  There were cut potatoes in the sauce, too.  My wife enjoyed her dinner and she also expressed that it could be spicier.  Wow, are we going to 4 or 5 next time?  What happened to my gabacha?  The naan was the tastiest we've had here.  It wasn't quartered like other times but served in one large round that we tore apart.\n\nAfter dinner, she got khir and I pistachio kulfi.  I've had the khir before and while good, I wanted to try something different.  The pistachio ice cream was really, really good.  \nI asked RS if it was made in house or could I go to the Indian store and get it out of the freezer.  Sure enough, it's made in house.  There goes that idea for a repeat.\n\nRS was quite a pleasant server!  He refilled my iced tea when I was getting low and he gave us chance to look over the menu with no hurry and then was ready to answer any questions.\n\nI have a couple of other Indian restaurants to try, but for me, either for lunch buffet or dinner, Mint tops all the others.  It is very good!"

HOWEVER, they honored the discount themselves and told us to get a refund for our certificate and will probably do the same for others. He looked upset a bit explaining it so it's probably something ugly... I thought it was cool that they will honor it themselves to help out the customers. \n\n*********\nFor years I ate Indian food on a weekly basis and for a while I stayed away since I burned out and the BF never had Indian food before so away we went. \n\n The drink selection is one main reason that made me really want to try them. We are beer nerds so it makes for a lovely surprise that a unassuming Bistro would have such an impressive drink menu. The BF wasn't sure of what, and our server (I think possibly the owner) asked what kinds of flavors he likes and gave a few recommendations. I always appreciate a place that knows what they sell since it seems most people don't care about beer the way they do of wine. The BF took his suggestion of a Augustjn Abbey Ale ($7) and I had a Troubadour Obscura ($7) which the guy poured into TULIPS with care to produce a proper head! I had a nerd moment that they had the proper kind of glasses and someone cared about our drinks as much as we do. He treated it like a sommelier would a fine wine. \n\nWhile we waited for food we were served papadam with a tamarind chutney and a cilrantro mint chutney. All really finely made. \n\nFor food we really couldn't decide to we went with a Indian Sampler ($30). It doesn't look like a lot of food, but we were both comfortably full.\n\nIt includes:\n\n*chicken tikka masala- this was a lovely tikka. I've had a lot and this was one of the better ones I've had. Very robust, but balanced. The BF loved this and raves it's the best curry he's had and he had a foodie moment (aww, I think us Yelpers are getting to him...maybe he'll change his mind about doing reviews one day). \n\n*lamb vindaloo- the lamb was very tender and the sauce complimented it very well with a bit earthiness, tangyness and a tad spicy. \n\n*tandoori chicken- crisp and nicely spiced outside, juicy inside\n\n*mixed veggie curry- had a good mix of cauliflower, zucchini, beans, peppers. The curry had a very light and fragrant flavor to it...I can't quite place the spices, but I liked this. \n\n*chef choice of lentils- today it was daal. I like daal since it's earthy and comforting. \n\n*we got yoghurt, basmati rice, and garlic naan as well. The naan was pretty noms here. \n\n*Khir came with it for dessert. It's a rice and milk porridge with raisins, nuts and cardamom according to the menu. When I was eating it, to me it tasted more flowery than just cardamom, like possible orange blossom water was added. It's the kind of light dessert that would be amazing for a hot summer day since it's served cold and has such bright flavors.\n\nWe also ordered another dessert that I thought I had and loved at another restaurant and at friends house but haven't come across it in a while. Turns out it was what I was looking for! \n\nLal Mohan ($2.99) the description says it's served cold, but it's served piping hot! It's these round pastries that are fried so the outside is crisp and the inside has a creamy kind of dough. They throw it into syrup and it absorbs it so it flavors it throughout.They come 3 to a serving in a shot glass, balls are about gumball sized so you don't get much of it, but it's quality. It's a comforting kind of dessert that would be a good for people who like fried mochi with honey, warm donuts, zeppolis, beignets. \n\nThe service was friendly and helpful. I like the little details that show they care like having proper beer glasses or giving us warm plates. Utensils were impeccably polished- no water marks at all. It felt very comfortable with the warm decor and the good staff making you feel good about being there. I just got a strong feeling that they are proud of this place in the pride they take for the little details. \n\nI haven't been this surprisingly satisfied in a long time. The BF was super happy with discovering Indian food and having a food epiphany of sorts about it....days later he's still telling me about the tikka and how he wants to go next weekend. \n\n Definitely we will be coming back for a la carte and also the buffet sounds like a deal. If our next experience is as good as this one, it can quickly grow to be a favorite."

We were between this place and another highly rated one on Yelp, but ultimately decided to eat here because of the modern decor and fun atmosphere. We decided to get the Meal for Two that included the Tikka Masala and vegetable curry. The Tikka masala was to die for and some of the best we ever had. The meal for two was perfect! It came with two apps, and assortment of entrees and dessert. We will definitely eat here again!!! It didn't disappoint. You know you've found a great one when you are surrounded by locals."

            "review": "Good restaurant with mediocre at best service and decor. \n\nThe food was good, a mixure of Indian and Nepalese food. The curries were quite tasty and Naan was great. However, I was expecting more Nepalese and Himalayan food and less more traditional Indian food fare. However, all in all cuisine aspect of the place is definitely above average.\n\nService was poor. We came in for an early dinner (around 5PM), and the place was empty. A few Nepalese gentleman (friends of the owner, I presume) were sitting together talking business and writing stuff on notepad right in front of the customers--not professional. That would have been okay, but to top it off, one of the managers, or possibly the owner was also serving the tables and was quite slow with water/drink refills and was very rude in questions about different, unfamiliar menu items. He even had a smirk on his face a couple of times. The tables were unimpressive and some of the booths were ripped in places and patched together with tape.\n\nOverall, for me to return to this place, I would have to make sure that the server/manager was not there that day and that it was busier so I do not have to see creepy business conversations. But, I may come back and recommend this place for unique and tasty food."

Was greeted by a cheerful fellow and seated in a booth while waiting for my date. Prompt water, and after a little confusion trying to order top shelf vodka/soda/lime. \n\nI had looked forward to trying either the Vegan or Vegetarian Chef's Dinners (crazy amounts of food, a bit a of everything for $44 $38, respectively) he was reluctant so we went a la carte, which ended up with far less food. They also offer Gluten Free Chef's Menu & have one of the most clearly marked menus I've ever seen describing each item and what categories they fall into, awesome. \n\nThe waiter takes your order on an iPhone, which took us a few seconds to register that he wasn't just Yelping :) When I was taking pictures of menu & food, I was asked if I was Yelping and copped to it. He proudly pointed out Yelp sticker on door. \n\nNow, down to food:\n\nI ordered a cup of yellow dal : light, herbaceous and delicious enough to keep around to mop up the last bits with nan. Date had never tried it before and loved it, too. \n\nTwo orders of Nan: yummy (too much bread for me, but guess he likes carbs) \n\nBrown Basmati rice: yes, please! They happily informed us it would be refilled on request and it was. \n\nMy main course was vegan tikka masala which I ordered at level 8. Some heat, but I'd go 10 next time. Complex, full of veggies and spices and I took half home. \n\nDate had Mango Lassi, which he enjoyed and a usual lamb korma guy tried the vegetarian version level 8, too and ate every bite, most of the nan, and surprisingly, his first brown rice?! \n\nIn all, service was attentive, water glasses were filled and we thoroughly enjoyed everything. In my pictures is a cute \"Happy Face Rating\" which came with bill I thought was adorable. Thought it a bit pricy at $65 + change but that would have been easily remedied ordering the Chef's Menu for 2. Another funny thing: we were trying to figure out what \"1 Russian $10\" was on check = it was my cocktail ( guessing Stoli)\n\nMy date went back today for the $10.99 lunch buffet, which he really dug. Guess he enjoyed Mint as much as I did. Once I try more items, I will update review and am pretty sure it will hold up or bump to 5*. Another plus: half orders! Keeps making me crush on you harder, Mint, you charmer. How flirty is it that they thanked me on the Facebook (c'mon y'all want to say THE Facebook so let's do it...) \n\nDirectly across the street from the Atomic Testing Museum: perfect place to hit for lunch before or after. Yummy."

That lets me know that the flavors are authentic and it was.  Even my cousin who spent some time in India was impressed with the quality, flavors, and selection.  The buffet consists of a mixture of North and South Indian dishes, and every dish tastes so distinct with it's robust spices and flavors. The vegetarian dishes are so flavorful they have the power to convert any carnivore. \n\nAfter devouring 2 full plates, another cousin even made the comment \"I am willing to become obese for this\". That, in itself, is a testament to the deliciousness of Mint Bistro.  We actually had to practice some restraint from consuming the entire buffet ourselves.  We will definitely be back."

            "review": "Every time I visit Las Vegas I must without fail eat at Mint Indian Bistro, because I believe it's one of the best Indian restaurants in the country.  I say this after having sampled the vegetarian food selection at over a hundred Indian restaurants in about a dozen major cities over the past two decades.  The diversity, freshness, and flavor of the Nepali/Indian vegetarian food at Mint is unmatched.\n\nI usually order the Lumbini Platter, which is vegan.  This is not cheap at $28 and others may simply wish to try the lunch buffet instead.  But for those willing to try the vegan platter, let me say that it's health food that tastes like gourmet food.  The meal comes with rice, whole wheat roti, a mixed lentil daal with a tantalizing smoky flavor, a few different vegetable combinations each with their own unique flavor, and a carrot pudding for dessert.  On my last visit Chris, the owner, who has become a friend of mine, recommended I try the soy mango lassi afterward, and being in an adventurous mood I tried it and was very happy with the result.\n\nWhat makes the food at Mint so different is that the flavors of all the ingredients come out in a delightful blend and dance on your palate, because unlike most Indian restaurants, the chef here is sparing with the chili powder, uses oil in carefully controlled amounts, and uses different spice combinations in each dish.  As a result you eat to your heart's content, enjoy every bite, remember the delicious curries Mom cooked at home (if you're from India), and end up feeling like you've done your body a favor with all that nutrition."

I don't like desserts so I can't comment on them; the vegetarian dishes, kadhai paneer, Saag, mushroom potatoes, dal, sambar, idli, rasam, pulao were all great. In the non veg section there was chicken tikka masala, chilli chicken, tandoori chicken, goat curry and another chicken dish. They all were great; I ate a bit of each coz it was that good. Also they bring your choice of bread fresh at your table unlike other Indian restaurants who leave theirs at the buffet table.\n\nOh yeah, if you're Indian and drink iced/cold water, you need to tell them that.

Regretfully, it took us a year to come back. A year in which we undoubtedly missed many more memorable meals. We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and were seated in what I would call the 'choicest table' (actually a corner booth). Our waiter was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu which was to be expected. We each asked for suggestions, stating preferences and dietary restrictions, and we felt our waiter nailed it as we were all thrilled with our order. I, especially, appreciated the vegetarian and vegan selections. The food was nothing short of heavenly and the naan  could not have been more perfect. The somosas? To die for! Service was expeditious and expertly executed. I would also like to point out that rice comes FREE with the entrees unlike many other Indian restaurants in Las Vegas (which I refuse to patronize for that very reason). The ladies room was immaculate (always a good sign). I cannot wait to go back and try the lunch buffet at Mint. I am an extremely picky diner who expects both top-notch cuisine AND a 'dining experience'...Mint Indian Bistro delivered both handsomely. Five HUGE stars!"

The staff are very attentive, and soon we had our drinks. We ordered an onion potato dosa, an order of malai kabob chicken, and onion cilantro naan.\nThe dosa is delicately positioned on a silver tray with delicious sauces, and the filling was very tasty. It left me craving more filling... The dosa was perfect. The onion combination with the malai kabob was heavenly, because the lemon pieces were generous, making the basmati rice and chicken sparkle with flavor and tenderness. The four pieces of naan were scrumptious. We had tried onion cilantro flavor and were not disappointed. Mint is a good place to know, and we look forward very much to checking out the second location west of the Strip. I recommend parking around the end of the stores because the front driveway is busy and full of taxis, so backing out is a trip. We had no problem parking on the east end, further away from the front parking spots."

While I enjoyed my vegan naan he thought it was just 'ok' and ordered an additional basket of the original version. They had three different soups and I think all of them at least vegetarian. The surprise of our meal was how delicious their Wittekerke Belgian wheat beer ($4) was! It was yummy and we ordered a second round. They also have awesome mango chutney.

We were having a tough time coming up with a new place to visit so I went to Yelp. I started looking up various ethnic cuisines and I did a search for Nepalese food. Much to my surprise a place called Mint Indian Bistro showed up. After reading the reviews it seemed like the place had a mix of Himalayan and Northern Indian cuisine. So we made a resolution, we'll try some appetizers and if we didn't like it we would go to a different restaurant for our main meal.\n\nAll that plan B contingency stuff went out the window when I looked at the menu. They actually had menu items marked as vegan and vegetarian such that for once I would not have to ask about the ingredients they use in each of the dishes. So we made the plunge. We decided to share the Vegan Sampler and it was good. I want to say it was great, but there were a couple of items in the sampler that I did not enjoy as much as the rest.\n\nAdditionally the decor and feel of the restaurant was very nice. They even turned the lights up for us temporarily while we were perusing the menu so my mother could see the menus as she squinted without her reading glasses again.\n\nWith full disclosure and all that jazz I would say the food was in the four star range, but the addition of the vegan friendly menu really pushes the rating up for me into the five star range. I gotta help promote any vegan friendly place here in Vegas because they are not as prevalent as they are in other towns."

Everyone is knowledgeable in the food and readily answers questions though, which is great for me because I barely know anything about Indian food.\n\nThe food is bomb and I'm seriously craving it right now.

Very helpful for those who have limited diets.\n\nMy favorite was probably this lamb dish during the lunch buffet which I cannot remember but I assure you, it was awesome.

Everything was so delicious, staff was courteous and helpful. We started with vegetables pakodas (pakora). Then we had Mango Masala, Palak Paneer, and Baingain Bharta; which were all amazing. The Naan was light and fluffy and the rice perfectly cooked. This is a DON'T MISS restaurant if you are visiting the area."

Luckily, Mint Indian Bistro crossed our path! I ordered the naan stuffed with paneer cheese (an Indian cottage cheese) with the samosa chaat, and my husband ordered the chicken tikka masala - a creamy, tomato, spicy curry that can be ordered mild, medium or hot.  Even though I only ordered an appetizer, it was so filling!  The samosa was topped with a tamarind sauce, a mint sauce, and garbanzo beans.  It paired perfectly with the paneer naan.  For dessert, we shared a perfectly petite portion of mango kulfi - a mango custard, which was very deeeelicious.\n\nAlso, tons of vegan and vegetarian options.. including gluten free and organic beers and wines! Amazing.\n\nThe price is right for the amazing customer service and quality of food here. Definitely going back!"

There was a lot of variety here, almost too much, as it was hard to tell the differences by a non-seasoned Indian food expert like me  But everything was fresh and good, except the tandoori being a little overcooked.  Here is a pic of my plate :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mint-indian-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#6hnFlW45fvu6-AVVij-66A\n\nThere were some really good dishes, but I really enjoyed the chicken and mild curry goodies. Also, the garlic naan bread was super yummy! I also liked the more spicy chicken dish, which had peppers and other tidbits. They have plenty of orange slices for my little one, which makes him a very happy boy!  \n\nCome check it for a great and inexpensive Indian food buffet!"

We are vegan but anyone would have loved what we ordered! \n  Started with vegetable stuffed dosa that comes with 4 different dipping sauces.  Also ordered a cocktail recommended by our server Jay.  Five spice passionfruit mojito- I think- lol.  Had fresh ginger, star anise, mint, lemon,cherries.  \n  After taking a look their menu we decided on the vegan prix fixe menu which was $42.99 for 2 people.  Each person got a bowl of tomato soup, shared an appetizer and then a a huge sampler entree of the veg korma, curry, dal, rice, pickled veg, roti and more.., and a dessert.  Everything was prefect.  The dessert that they normally serve with the vegan set menu they were out of though so they gave us some sort of mango sorbet.  It was so frozen that it was hard to eat with a spoon but I was so full it didn't matter.  One other downer is that we did have to ask a total of three times (two different employees) in order to get our bottle of sparkling water.  No big deal though, other than that we had atleast 4 different employees serve us, check in, help out.  Honestly if the service had been perfect I would say 5 stars.\n  Great staff and genuine.  We will be back.  Can't wait to try lunch buffet."

Began with the fried veggies which were both cold & unchewable. Then so happy to see Chicken Korma until I realize it's thigh not breast. Chili Chicken very good as was the Garlic Naan but the rest was totally \"off\" for me today. Will now search for another #1. Forgot to mention this was straight up Noon & last visit a couple weeks ago was not good either. Is it just me or do others think Tandoori Chicken should be a bit crispy on the outside?"

I've had the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Korma and they were both tasty.  The Garlic Naan bread is also good because they slather butter on it to make it extra oily and heart stopping.  The ambience of the restaurant is somewhat modern instead of looking like a New Delhi cafeteria as many Indian restaurants here do.  While not as good as my beloved Maharani in Honolulu, I can say with confidence that I wouldn't be surprised to see Richard Parker or Orange Juice eating here."

So, when we looked up for Indian food in the Vegas area, I wasn't having high expectations. I was surprised by what I had there. It was freaking amazing! And the cherry on the cake, it was zabihah halal. We had the following:\n\nChicken fried rice: absolutely awesome. The rice had a slight crunchy texture and though by concept may sound like raw, but was actually superb.\n\nYellow dal: the best dal I have had in the US. Period. Low in spices and full of flavor. In love with dal now.\n\nMalai kofta: didn't care much for the kofta, but the gravy was awesome.\n\nChicken kadhai: wasn't bad but we had far superior food on our table.\n\nChicken momos: the momos were amazing but the sauce with it wasn't. I have had a lot of momos in India (my fav roadfood snack after chaat). I used to love the chilli sauce served with the momos in India. Here the momos were pretty close to the original though.\n\nPaneer pakoda: good. Liked the sprinkling of chaat powder over it. \n\nChilli chicken: was nice. Not like India, but am not complaining.\n\nThe portion sizes could be upped a notch. The half portions are way too small and the full aren't that large themselves.\n\nThe decor is nice. Not date night but better than Indian restaurant standards. The service was really good."

I'm not too sure on the value as my husband and I shared the Indian sampler plate which was all pretty tasty, but wasn't exactly a ton of food for two people (even though the menu indicated it would be plenty). But maybe I'm just used to having tasty leftovers to take home when I go out for Indian... hmm.\n\nI'm gonna have to update my review after I try the buffet, because I've heard good things. For now, Mint remains a solid option for Indian food in Vegas, but nothing really mind-blowing."

What we have now is a well-rounded, extremely consistent buffet and a comprehensive menu ready to cater to every food preference.\n\nAt 10.99 for buffet it's no wonder that this place can have a queue out the door around lunchtimes. \n\nPlenty of delicious fare to choose from and some vegetarian options for my wife. Oh, and garlic naan that's among the finest in the valley.\n\nDon't miss out!"

I don't know who does the cooking but they need to stop immediately!!!\n\nWe ordered the Chicken Kadhai, Vertical Vindaloo (with chicken) and Boneless Lamb Kabobs. The chicken dishes were both excessively oily and god only knows what part of the chicken they used. I specifically asked for breast meat and that I would even pay a few extra $$ for it. The guy said no problem. I came home and opened the containers and saw this dark, muscle-ridden meat sitting in front of me. Both chicken dishes looked exactly the same even though they're supposedly 2 different styles. The kabobs were HORRIBLE. Huge pieces of lamb that were nowhere near tender. \n\nTo top it all off, it was $60 for 3 dishes, some naan and rice. I will never visit this place again! I can make better Indian dishes at home!"

The menu is cleverly written and the food has never disappointed me.\n\nTry the makhani!\n\nService can be a little uneven. Sometimes they will bring dishes without serving spoons, or present a shared appetizer without plates so you have to ask for them. At times I've had to flag them down to get the check. \n\nSometimes the kitchen is a little odd. The menu says the tomato soup has paneer, but I recently ordered it and it came without it. So I had them redo it. I was there again last week and as I was ordering the soup I asked about this, and had to point to the menu where it says the soup has paneer. No really, it says paneer, I like paneer, bring it to me with the paneer!\n\nI am a little worried about them, however . . . they used to have the biggest beer list in Las Vegas, but now if you want to order beer, they are out of stock of almost everything on the list. They point you to a table where you can look at what is available, and I'd guess there are less than ten selections. Not a good sign that they are not sticking to the brand promise of an amazing beer list. Times are tough I guess, and no one wants to order expensive inventory that is going to sit."

Then it took them a while to bring waters and even longer to take our order. When we finally got our food, it was very dissatisfying. $21 for overcooked dried lamb on a bed of arugula and Dijon mustard, and they didn't even offer rice. I could barely chew the lamb. My husband did the inferno challenge. Couldn't stomach it. They offered him a tiny sauce dish filled with plain yogurt to settle his stomach. They charged us $3 extra for it. I can buy a whole tub of plain organic yogurt at the grocery store for that much. Still, it was thought to be a courtesy yogurt. Lastly, one of the waiters approached our table and offered us to-go boxes. He never came back. Just ignored us completely along with our initial waiter. My husband had to walk to the counter to get the check. And I walked up later to get a box and a bag. Perhaps it was just a bad night and the wrong dish to order, but still, not going to be returning to this place again."

First a note on the atmosphere, the restaurant had been booked for some event that sounded like a presentation on maintaining your visa. The event ran over and they were not taking walk ins so it's difficult to give a proper evaluation of the noise and the typical crowd. However we had a reservation and the staff quickly adjusted. The fact that an all Indian event would choose this place says something about the authenticity.\n\nWe ordered samosa and garlic naan to start. The pastry was light and crispy and the filling was perfect. The naan was light and fluffy. For main courses we got a chicken vindaloo which was tasty and well spiced and a shrimp mikhani. I had never heard of this dish and from the description was expecting something like a tikka massala. It wasn't. It had sweeter creamier taste. It was delicious and I highly recommend it. The staff also brought us extra naan with dinner.\n\nThis place is a gem and if you like Indian food worth a trip off the strip."

Drink orders, clear plates, extra napkins. I agree with other posts that service here is not stellar. \n\nThe seating here is very tight. If coming with a party larger than 4, recommend a reservation. We came today with 4 adults and 2 small kids and were crammed into a small corner booth.

Great service and a great line of food.  \n\nThe salads were great, but do not be tricked with the spiciness of some of the peppers.  I was tricked by thinking it was a bell pepper, but after five minutes of crying, I have learned my lesson to chew more no matter how hungry you are.  \n\nThe curries were delectable.  The goat was especially wonderful.  The soups were good.  My favorite was the tomato.  The others made me feel like it was lacking something.  The naan was great.  The misses liked the garlic one while I liked the original.  \n\nAlthough we came early, before they opened, they let us come inside away from the cold and sit while they finished preparing the buffet for us.  The service was wonderful.  I love how their menus have descriptions of everything.  From the ingredients to the drinks to the little anecdotes about how particular drinks were not really Indian.

            "review": "-Lunch Buffet Review -\n(TL;DR - I prefer my Indian cuisine to have lots of flavor, spices, and heat. Yet, sadly Mint didn't meet my requirements. The flavors here were too boring. Plus I had stomach pain soon after eating here. I won't be returning.) \n\nWe prefer Mt. Everest's lunch buffet - they have a better selection of flavorful curries and an overall better tasting selection of food. Also, their naan (even if they don't offer garlic naan for buffet anymore) was fluffy like pillows and had more charred stone oven flavor. \n\nMaybe I'm the odd woman out and call me crazy, but I prefer my food to be exploding with flavor and rocking my taste buds off, you know, the type of flavor that punches you in the face. Especially when I'm in the mood for Indian cuisine, I expect bold spices and ingredients to jump out. Unfortunately, Mint didn't meet my requirements for a satisfying Indian buffet.\n\nThere was a scarcely detectable amount (if any) of spice used here, no layering of flavor, and specifically, no wow-factor. The selection here was poor and didn't offer up the typical items I was hankering for - Malai Kofta, Saag Paneer, or even Samosa, to name a few. The list goes on with my rants about this place.\n\nMint is also super sticky, right as I was seated, my silverware placed on the table was stuck like glue! I had to use some elbow grease to pick them up. Plus, I despise their buffet set up - you constantly have to touch the sticky germ-y handles to lift the lids up off of the trays on every single item, then use the spoon to scoop up your food. It was really gross touching the handles. Good thing I brought my wet-ones. The plates that they use gets hot instantly when you place hot food on it, so I had a hard time holding my plate without burning my hands. Also a pet peeve - they have Pepsi here and it's not fizzy at all, it was flat. \n\nI only found 1 item from the buffet that was delicious enough for me to get seconds of, that 1 item was the chicken korma (cashew chicken curry.) Everything else was super bland, dried out, or boring. \n\nHere's the breakdown of what I tried: \n\n- Mint and tamarind chutney were both were refreshing and flavorful. They really helped to bring life to the boring curries and food. \n- Coconut chutney was alright, but not something that I kept eating. \n- Chicken korma - rich and sweet, also had tiny hints of spice which is why this was my favorite dish out of everything I tried. \n- Saag mushroom wasn't my favorite. I really missed the cheese curds. There was no bold flavor, richness, or natural sweetness from the spinach. It was seriously bland and sad. \n- Chicken tikka masala's flavor was muted. It tasted like bland tomato cream soup and lacked all of the rich luscious flavor that I've grown fond about tikka masala. I did not finish finish it.\n- Tandoori chicken was dried out and tough. \n- Chile chicken had decent flavor, but they were super dry.\n- Veggie tikka masala flavor was very boring, just creamy, and no lively spices going on in there.\n- They offered yogurt, which is fine, but I was upset that they didn't offer refreshing cucumber raita.\n- Cranberry rice had colorful specs of carrot and peas, but it wasn't amazing or memorable.\n- Both the garlic and butter naan were dry, plus the garlic flavor was faint and the butter naan was boring."

The service is great and they're very friendly and easy to communicate with, even with English speaking customers.  They even gave out two complimentary dishes since I've been here as a trial run to open up new items for the menu.  They are foodies as well, and know what to suggest and to whom.  The food we've ordered all came out very prompt.  The dishes here I found more delectable than the other Indian restauraunts.\n\nVegan, vegetarian, and meat lovers all alike with feel welcome here.  The music has a mixed playlist of Indian music along as well as techno and other genres.  Come try it out cuz this place is awesome.  Mint even has a ghost pepper inferno curry dish where you appear on the wall if you dare to try and succeed!  Kudos Mint. Good eats."

Soups are so good served steaming hot tried both the dal & the bean & lentil. Love the $10 AYCE lunch buffet, items change daily, so I need to keep going back to catch the chana masala. Just wish tney offered dosas as part of buffet but they do have an AYCE dosa nite. But there are always vegan options available on buffet & those soups, salad & fresh papadams. definitely a return to place."

My husband who goes to Las Vegas regularly on business trips, introduced me to the restaurant and I was hooked. This is his go to place he says, for a meal that is closest to a home cooked meal plus the variety they offer. He is on first name basis with the servers here and I found them very friendly and efficient. They also adjust the level of spice and you can opt for a healthier version of an item devoid of the butter. When I visit Las Vegas again, I will definitely go back to this wonderful restaurant for it is indeed a refreshing and a healthy change from all those heavy food indulgences that one can be subjected to on the Vegas strip!"

For the Husband and I, we ordered:\n\n* Karma Korma \"A creamy sauce sprinkled with nuts and assorted Himalayan spices.\" (with fresh veggies $12.99) - \n\n* Rebel Curry \"This is the Nepalese Gurkha version of the famous curry with a rebelliously inspired exotic blend of curry spices.\" (with lamb $13.99)\n\n* Garlic Naan ($2.99)\n\nOne thing I absolutely love are papadums and was so pleasantly surprised when they offered these to us complimentary!  (Other Indian restaurants don't offer it complimentary anymore!)  Both entrees were so flavorful and just delicious that we couldn't resist checking out their ever so popular lunch buffet option.  \n\nThe daily lunch buffet is $9.99 with kids 3 and under being free.  (Ages 4 to 7 years are $5.99.)  It's offered from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm.\n\nOne thing I appreciated was that they noted what food items were vegetarian and vegan.  As someone who recently stopped eating dairy, I found this very useful.\n\nWhen ordering naan, I was able to get this sans butter, which was quite appreciative in my situation.  And with my  new dietary restrictions, I was still able to enjoy quite a lot of food items and left feeling full and satisfied! \n\nTheir buffet menu can be found on their website, but it does change. \n\nOverall, we were both quite content with their food, a la carte or buffet.  Definitely one of the better Indian buffets in town, especially if you're looking for a vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free menu!"

Perhaps I was spoiled by having the delights of Devon so close by, but I really came to take quality Indian restaurants for granted.\n\nWe've been coming here since we were tourists and this place was known simply as \"Himalayan Cuisine,\" with Nepalse plates and much more rustic decor. Nowadays, the redone and renamed Mint is more of an Indo-Chinese fusion sort of place, but they have that one hallmark that every self-respecting Indian restaurant needs - a lunch buffet! It has a good selection compared to some of the other Indian lunch buffets in town and is a really good deal at $10. The ala carte dinner menu is very comprehensive and has lots of options and tweaks available to the courses, but we pretty much exclusively come for lunch when the value is best.\n\nThe service has traditionally been awful and inattentive but has gotten much better lately. With that marked improvement this is clearly our top choice for Indian food in the valley."

I thought $15 for a lamb vindaloo and $3.50 naans was a bit pricey but apparently thats what the Indian restaurants around UNLV charges so this was my first test.\n\nPros\n-Lamb Vindaloo, although not spicy (medium), was tasty that came with A LOT OF LAMB. Good cuts of lamb as the pieces were neither tough or fatty. \n-For $15, the portion of vindaloo was well sized and the rice it came with was more than enough\n-Very well packaged for takeout to ensure none of it spills on its journey to the stomach\n\nCons\n-Weak naan, was not big and fluffy. It is possible that it became soggy on the ride home but they did not have crispy edges that the good naan have.\n-Butter naan was not buttery and although garlic naan had garlic, the flavors did not transfer to the palate. (Surcharge for garlic was understandable, but for 'unbuttery' butter?)\n-Pricey naan considering it it was about $3.50 each.\n\nWill definitely come back to try the buffet soon, but will try the other Indian restaurants nearby before I order takeout from here again."

I would not recommend ordering any of the more elaborate drinks on the menu because the wait time would probably be even longer.\n\nWe ordered naan, an appetizer, and two entrees.  They brought out the naan first, then 10-15 minutes later, only one entree.  Then we waited about ten minutes for the second entree.  Thankfully, we were sharing both things, or this would've been way awkward.  At this point, we still hadn't received our appetizer, so we asked the waiter to please cancel it.\n\nThe food was actually quite great.  We ordered the Chef's special lamb kabob and the Vertical Vindaloo with chicken thigh, and they were both excellent.  The vindaloo was not saucy enough for my liking, and the \"Full\" size was rather small for the price.  Other than that, we weren't disappointed by the actual food, despite its strange delivery times."

            "review": "Mint Indian Bistro easily earns 4.5 stars but I'm rounding up to 5 stars because A. Yelp doesn't offer a half star review option and B. Mint's huge menu offers so much potential, I can easily see it going to 5 stars depending on what you order from here. and C. I'm easy to please.\n\nThis was our first dining out experience in Vegas. Despite what the directions may say to walk here if you're coming from the north on Paradise, don't venture off of Paradise until you reach E. Flamingo. The neighborhood gets real rough, real quick. Was it worth the short walk through the hood? You best believe!\n\nThis is everything Udupi Palace http://www.yelp.com/biz/udupi-palace-berkeley in The Bay Area should be and more. Service is quite good. The menu, in addition to being massive, is well labeled with what's Vegan and what's not. On top of being easy to distinguish between what's Vegan, the majority of dishes are offered in a Vegan and non-vegetarian version as well. While I appreciate that the menu is expansive, I was a little confused since it's laid out according to region. I'm not the biggest Indian food expert so I needed to comb through it to find what I was looking for. It seems to me it would be easier to navigate if it were separated by meat, veg, and so on. \n\nThe Popular Pakoda are delicious little fried buggers full of shredded veggies. Their mint and tamarind chutneys are both very tasty. As a certified condiment whore I can say they're as good as you'll find at most places around.\n\nI love Malai Kofta, but haven't had it in years since I've never seen it made Vegan at any of the Indian restaurants I've been to. Once I saw they offered that, I was a happy boy. It wasn't quite as spicy as I was hoping, but it had a good creamy flavor with soft dumplings as a centerpiece. I'm sure if I asked them to bump up the spice level, it would be excellent. It also comes with a complimentary side of rice, which is a rarity nowadays.\n\nSpeaking of spice level. They offer to spice most things on a 1-10 scale. I'll have to come back to get my photo on the Inferno Wall of Fame by downing the Inferno Curry. I'll just be sure to pick up some throat numbing spray as was recommended to me by an expert in the subject matter. If I have to sign a waiver to eat something, I'm bringing my \"A\" game!\n\nThe Curry Pineapple Rice was alright. It wasn't mind blowing or anything. I would order something else in it's place. Especially since they already include plain rice with some of the entrees.\n\nWe ordered the Pistachio Kulfi as a dessert thanks to it's description. I was thinking it was a Vegan ice cream but it was much more icey. Not in a terrible way though. A little different but still good.\n\nThe Paratha was really good filled with potatoes and peas. It had a nice smoky taste on the verge of being burnt, but not all the way there yet.\n\nFor some reason in all my visits to Indian restuarants I've never once ordered a Lassi that I can remember. Even during my dark Vegetarian years when I was eating everything BUT meat. My dining partner encouraged me to order one since we've never seen a Vegan version. I went with peach, which I think was a great choice. I thought I was getting the alcoholic version from the \"Lassi Bar\" but it wasn't according to the receipt. It was still really good, like a more refreshing, less heavy milkshake. Very recommended! \n\nIt's not cheap, but you get all this food in nice looking digs for not too much coin http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mint-indian-bistro-las-vegas?select=MPGTXF3oXowuVnbHZcwE0A#GpkSqhM7xSy7PExgzZwQbg\n\nI would easily go out of my way to dine at Mint during my next visit to Vegas. Although you can find \"decent to good\" Indian food on The Strip, Mint is worth the short drive/walk/bus ride, or whatever means of transportation you use to get here."

It's a little pricier than most other Indian lunch buffets I've had ($12.99 here), but I will admit that the quality is quite good.\n\nThe interior is very sleek and clean, and the buffet area is kept very tidy. The restaurant has a good number of tables but isn't huge. I was the first diner to enter shortly after the opened at 11AM, but by the time I was finishing my meal around noon, the restaurant was almost completely full.\n\nSince it's buffet style, there isn't a ton of waiter service, but servers would come by to collect my used plates. They give you water carafes so you can refill your water by yourself. You also get a choice of naan when you are seated, and the naan is made-to-order than brought to your table in a basket.\n\nWhile there were no samosas or kheer during my visit today, I was surprised to see idli and bhel puri, two items that I rarely see at buffets. I especially enjoy bhel puri with all of its crunchy bits. =)\n\nAll the other dishes were good too, and there was a decent variety. They even snuck in one Indo-Chinese dish, chilli chicken. Surprisingly, the sweet chicken tikka masala was not that good (the sauce was a little overcooked and some of the yogurt had coagulated, plus the chicken was a bit tough), though the paneer tikka masala which has the same sauce base was much smoother. I was also surprised by the spice level of things that didn't look very spicy and that aren't that spicy when I've had them elsewhere (saag mushroom, daal). On the flip-side, the chicken vindaloo was just moderately spicy; go figure. Nothing was too spicy for me to handle, but some dishes were just packing unexpected heat.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back to try ordering off the menu. All in all, a solid and very clean Indian restaurant.\n\nP.S. I was a bit alarmed when I saw all the recent one-star reviews on Yelp, but most of them seem to be centered around poor dinner service or takeout orders, and I came for buffet lunch. Food weighs most heavily in my ratings anyway, but make of that what you will. My experience today was not bad at all."

My experiences are based on dinner and not the lunch buffet. Their staff is very accommodating here and are experienced in dealing with large families and groups with small children. On busy evenings, you can flag down any of their waitstaff for assistance. I've never made a reservation here and have not waited more than 15 minutes during my last few visits. \n\nI love the extensive and almost daunting menu filled with northern and southern Indian dishes. We usually start off with some samosas and the Bhel Puri, which is an Indian snack food made of puffed rice. I always have to get garlic naan with my meals. The naan is an Indian flat bread that's served hot out of the oven and has a wonderful texture. The bread is great for sopping up the sweet curry sauce of their Tikka Masala. Another dish to try is the smoky and aromatic lamb dish called Rogan Josh. If you're adventurous, they have plenty of other delicious dishes to choose from and also serve vegetarian fare."

            "review": "Mint Indian Bistro is an interesting spot. It's not like most Indian places I'm used to. A little more upscale, a little more gourmet, a little more... well... different. My paradigm for Indian food is, in general, that the best food comes from the dingiest places - so a proportionally inverse relationship between the fanciness of the decor and the quality of the food (from the standpoint of taste). When I walked in to Mint I immediately formed an impression about what I was going to eat, and I was not too surprised in the end. Just glad to have some decent Indian food since I come from a place that has none. \n\nThe food at Mint falls into the higher-end category - better meats, obviously more hand-made sauces, etc. Not as dirty, earthy, pungent, and 'street' as the style that really rocks my socks. But it's good nonetheless, and sticks fairly well to form as being actual Indian and not fusion, which is what I tend to see at higher-end Indian places. \n\nI sampled the chicken Vindaloo, which at a half order contained a surprising amount of tender, succulent chicken but not the same amount of potatoes that I'm used to. It has a decent heat to it but not quite the \"fiery descent\" that's comically described on the menu. The Saag Paneer is quite nice, with a less 'spinach-y' flavor than I'm used to. A much more subtle and balanced version of the heady green beast. The name of our third curry escapes me - a blond affair with veggies. Nice and creamy and delicious - probably my favorite of the three. Paired up with a bowl of basmati rice and a basket of Roti, 3 half-sized (8oz) dishes makes for a beyond-filling meal for two. Props for offering half-size portions... if only the price were half too!\n\nThe drinks list is mighty impressive, with a very extensive beer selection, some fun cocktails including a whole spate of flavored lassi offerings, and of course wine. My rose vodka lassi was interesting (tasted like rose!) and the mango rum is exactly what you'd expect. \n\nThree half-plates, Roti and two lassi cocktails came to a sum total of $54, kind of a lot for the amount of food, but definitely a higher quality of ingredients than I'm used to seeing in the street Indian I usually seek out. The experience, including the impeccable service, also adds in to the value. Papadam to start, clean plates to transition from papadam to meal, and constantly full waters. This is probably the largest departure from the dirty hole in the wall spots I hit in SF for my sub-continent fix. \n\nI'd definitely come back after spending some more time exploring Indian options in LV."

The buffet is only $12 and it comes with such a variety of foods, it's such a steal!  Considering I came here for dinner and ordered chicken tikka masala (buttered chicken) and naan; the bill came out to about $18.  The buffet includes chicken/vegetable tikka masala, tandoori chicken, basmati rice, bone-in lamb curry and more dishes i can't pronounce.\nIt includes normal and garlic naan! \nThe curry is packed with so much flavor, the naan comes out freshly made (HOT), the meat of the tandoori and chicken tikka masala is slightly dry but other than that I really can't complain. Food is an A- for me.\n\nThe only complaint I have is for dinner; their portions are a bit small for what you pay for but nonetheless still very tasty.\n\nService is spot on and punctual whenever you're out of drink, naan or if you have empty plates; oh yeah their naan is refillable!  Our server was extremely friendly, wasn't overbearing and took care of us throughout the whole dinner.\n\nAmbiance was very warm, lights dim but not dungeness and with trending indian songs to add culture to a very modern looking restaurant.  \n\nDespite having a few indian restaurants surrounding this area, i'll always return to Mint for their money worthy buffet, vegan options,affable and attentive service and their delicious food."

Service is very good and friendly. Compared to most buffets (for lunch) of its kind I thought theirs is among the better ones I've come across."

Being vegetarians, we had a VERY limited choice of food while on the vacation! Coming here was definitely a vegetarian's paradise! \n\nWe started with the sev puri which was awesome and followed it with their vegetarian Momos. The momos were steamed to perfection and the accompanying sauce with it was amazing. They did warn us that it would take 20 minutes for the momos to steam and we were absolutely ok with that. I definitely appreciated the heads up (they mention the 20 minute wait time on the menu too, which I thought was really considerate). We then ordered the fried rice and masala idli and they were really good too. I do have to warn you - their portion sizes are not very big - but definitely enough for 2 people of you order couple of appetizers and entr\u00e9es!\n\nWe also ordered the mango kulfi which was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend this place for anyone craving some good tasty Indian food!"

The cons: in every chicken dish that I've tried, the chicken is overcooked. I routinely expect that in chicken tandoori, but not in tikka masala, or even the chicken chili at Mint Bistro. Additionally, the food is definitely toned down for American tastes. I have to load up on the chili paste at the salad bar.\n\nI do the recommend the chutneys here, all of them but especially the mint and coconut chutneys.\n\nThe service and smiles on the staff merit five stars. I like to see happy people in a restaurant. That makes me believe the management cares enough to consistently produce a good product.\n\nFinally, the beer selection is very good, though for some odd reason, Mint Bistro carries no American beers, not even some of the premium micro-brews.\n\nI definitely recommend Mint Bistro and my criticisms are only offered in the hope that the management will strive to improve the minor deficiencies I have listed."

The first page of the menu explains what every symbol beside each entree means. So if you don't eat meat, dairy, gluten, nuts, and etc ... Mint has you covered. \n(see photo below)\n\nOur orders were taken on an iPad mini where every possible alteration to any dish is already programmed into the app that they use. I believe that they also have an app that you can download on your smart phones to order before coming into the restaurant. Sweet!! \nNice to see a restaurant seeking out new ways to better service their guests. Not something you see everyday in most restaurants. \n\nFood was excellent. The vegan tikka masala was great.  \nI also tried my friend's potato curry which was good but I am a carnivore so I probably would've enjoyed one of their meat curries a bit more. \n\nHeard great things about their lunch buffet so I will definitely have to come back for that.

Luckily, I tried the lunch buffet this time around, and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. One thing that I did like on my first visit and still like about this place is the decor. It's definitely a good place to go for a romantic date. I also am fond of the service here. \n\nAnyways, back to the food. At the table, the server brought us our choice of either plain, butter or garlic naan (we chose garlic) and also roti (a thinner bread made with whole wheat). The garlic naan was yummy- soft, warm and studded with garlic bits, it was perfect for dipping into the soups and curries. The roti was good too, but I definitely prefer the naan. I can't remember all I ate, but I will list off my favorites. There were three soup varieties; I enjoyed the Sambhar soup (a hearty lentil soup) the most. I also enjoyed the seasoned rice dish, as well as the Chicken Tandoori and a vegetarian dish called Paneer Tikka Masala (blocks of soft cheese simmered in a spicy tomato-based stew). I also thought the Chicken Curry dish to be flavorful and good. For dessert, I had a few cubes of watermelon and one piece of Gulab jamun (fried balls of dough soaked in a sweet syrup flavored with cardamom and rosewater). I wish I went back for seconds on dessert though. The best part about the lunch buffet is that it is healthy or at least tastes healthy. \n\nAll in all, I had a nice time here. I would probably go back again- for lunch, that is.\n\nP.S. Parking here during busy times can be dangerous. Small parking lot, too many cars, etc....Be careful!"

My friend had informed the owner what it was we were doing, and he was more than accommodating. He sat down with us and we were able to talk to him about the restaurant which is really nice. \n\nThe food, however, was so disappointing. Two of us split the Indian sampler, as it was advertised that it was \"Perfect for two to share or one to feast on.\" Naturally, I was expecting a bunch of food. To my disappoint, when the platter came out - it was nothing more than barely a half cup of each item. It was not enough to satisfy one persons' hunger, let alone enough for two to share. We had even ordered an extra side of naan. It was sad to say, we had more naan than food to eat it with. It's a sad, sad day when that happens. \n\nI will say, their mango lassi was good.\n\nA majority of my group was disappointed, just as I was, in the food to price proportions. Although, many of them left full, unlike myself - the price they paid for the food wasn't sitting too well with them. But who can blame em? My friend and I spent about 40 dollars between the two of us, to leave the place completely dissatisfied and hungry. \n\nNeedless to say, when we left the restaurant, the first place I headed to was the Jack in the Box in the same parking lot."

Unless you have super high tolerance for extremely hot food, I suggest you go easy on the chili peppers but the rest of the salad was awesome. \n\nFor the main course I had Aloo Gobi Masala (potatoes and cauliflower in a curry sauce), brown rice and an order of buttered paratha (multiple thin layers of whole wheat bread) with fire roasted garlic. Aloo Gobi tends to be a standard dish at Indian restaurants, though the flavor, consistency and oily-ness of the curry sauce often differs from one restaurant to the next. I have to say it is out of this world here! It's like you died and went to Indian food heaven! The paratha was also outstanding . . . a little heavy on the garlic but I happen to love it this way. And it's such a pleasure to be able to get brown rice at an Indian restaurant. Very few offer it though I'm not sure - in this day and age - why this remains the case. The meal was absolutely perfect. The dim lighting, plush decor and warm ambiance of the dining room was a wonderful compliment to the wonderful food. No complaints about the service either. \n\nI had such a great experience that I came back a few days later and tried their Karma Korma with veggies, along with the garlic paratha again. The veggies were perfectly cooked and the seasoning was heavenly. The sauce was nice and creamy . . . coconut milk-based I think. Regardless, it was one of the best vegan Indian dishes I've ever had.\n\nIf you like Indian food, you HAVE to check this place out if you come to Las Vegas. Absolutely outstanding food!"

Once it did, all the dishes we ordered were satisfactory but I've definitely had better Indian food in the Bay Area. \n\nOne random thing I noticed was that the waiters all were obsessed with making sure our water glasses were full.

The Mango Lassi was flavorful but not too sweet.

Even for those who are uninitiated in Indian quisine, the buffet is the perfect introduction as you get to pick and choose from the best entrees in the region. We just tried the dinner, and I got the spicy potato dosa and let me tell you- it was awesome! We come back here again and again and, I promise, one day I'll work up the nerve to take the ghost pepper curry challenge :) \n\nAlso, we tried the food at the brand new location on the West side. They have some Indo-Asian dishes that are mind-blowingly tasty, including little fried lentil flour bread that makes naan seem passe, as well as fried baby corn (Amazing!) and the best chicken wings I've had in Vegas - with a twist of a chili sauce and minced chives. Also, as with the original location, the decor is relaxing, and modern. However the new location is a lot larger. I can't wait to go again!"

Perhaps even better than any place in the bay area. We were in Vegas for 3 days, and ended up going to the same place on each of the 3 nights for dinner! I tried the Handi Biryani. They ask for spice level (from 0 to 10!), and I actually noticed a difference in spiciness corresponding to what you order. I ordered 10 and the food was pretty spicy. (spicy = good :)). They also have an \"Inferno biryani\" which is supposedly so spicy that you have to sign a waiver to order it. The waiter discouraged us from having that and I obliged.  You don't want to risk losing a night in Vegas , right? :) The place is quiet on the one weekday we went, and was pretty packed on both the weekends."

They were quite busy when we arrived after 8pm on a Saturday night, but the wait wasn't too long, though there wasn't a place to sit down inside (it was a cold night in Vegas). You'll see that I frequent Indian restaurants fairly regularly wherever I travel, so I know what I like and how it compares to other establishments. \n\nMy family and I decided to go with the Chef's Northern India tasting menu and were given a plethora of different dishes, though with smaller than normal portions. We all enjoyed the pakora (they called them pakodas) and again thought we were in for the best Indian meal in a long time. That being said, the lamb vindaloo was rather skimpy on the lamb (and it was tougher than it should have been), the chicken tikka masala had great flavor; but was more masala than chicken, and the daal was good, but just a tad undercooked. I was also disappointed when I asked for a \"6-7 spicy\" I received something more like a 2 or 3. They do have something they call Inferno chili sauce, but I thought my dishes came from a very universal pot that's geared to less spice (and flavor). As other reviewers have noted, their naan bread is excellent. Service was satisfactory, but I never felt like I was being \"served\" meaning it was more obligatory than driven. \n\nAll in all, a good Indian meal, though I have had better for less money."

Called in my order for takeout and headed on over. Upon entering, saw that the restaurant itself was a bit nicer and more upscale than I expected. Service was a bit lackluster- waited for a bit at the door before being acknowledged, my boxed food was waiting at a table with a manager-looking guy who brought over my receipt and took my card with a series of gestures, then ran my card and disappeared without a thank you or asking if I needed anything else. \nThat probably explains why I didn't get any utensils or napkins, nor did I add on another side or additional naan as I'd originally planned. And there were only two tables seated at 5:30PM so it's not because they were busy.\n\nI found this place to be a bit pricey. \nI like that half-size entrees are available for a slightly-lesser fee, but found that the decrease in pricing (usually around $3) isn't worth the decrease in product. Lesson learned. For three half-size entrees, one container of rice was provided. Also ordered one garlic naan. Total was around $40, which is a bit steep. I always have difficulty paying so high for a la carte indian food when the buffet prices are so cheap for so much. I feel like there's a discrepancy there that should result in lower prices rather than higher, but whatever.\n\nQuality made my entree choices worthwhile: saag paneer, baingan bharta, and lamb korma. The saag was decent but I prefer mine a little saucier, this one was a lot of spinach and good-sized cubes of paneer but the dish seemed as if it hadnt been cooked down long enough. Best eaten with the garlic naan, which was fragrant and delicious.\nBaingan bharta was ordered exclusively based on recommendations here on Yelp, and I was not disappointed. It was flavorful and I appreciated that the sauce was on the thicker side, which allowed for it to go well with the rice. \nThe lamb korma is the only dish that had any spice to it whatsoever, and it was quite mild despite ordering a 5/10- at Thai restaurants, that'll get you a spicy dish, but I guess Indian is a little more laid back with the scale. I know now for next time. Dish didn't have quite as much lamb as expected for a $10 portion.\n\nSpeaking of portions, I was a little confused by the portions and packing of my takeout.\nI appreciated that the half-size entree portions were packed in plastic lidded containers and wrapped in plastic to ensure that nothing spilled. But the size of the portions themselves were on the small side- think the smallest hummus containers at the grocery. That size. \n\nGoing to put this on the list to try again for the lunch buffet, thinking that will be a better value and possibly a better overall experience. Good quality, vast menu of options including several vegetarian dishes."

Hmmmm now that I ponder on that I'm making Mint sound like the food sucks! Lol okay okay the food here is great too! Maybe I should make it a full 5 stars!?! \n\nLunch buffet is $12/person which includes the naan. I'm a naan lover so I went \"all out\" and ordered the garlic one. LOVE! They have the basic Indian cuisine: tandoori, masala, salad, chick pea green stuff, pinkish mashed stuff, yellow curry-ish stuff (wowwwwww I'm excellent at naming Indian cuisine)! *sigh \n\nAlright alright yes they do have all the basics. And I ate a bit of everything to maximize my buffet option and everything was real yummy. Selection is maybe about 10 different trays of hot food and the salad bar. They have a consistent flow of eaters so that's more confirmation that this place rocks. \n\nBut what rocked the most was the staff who was very accommodating, friendly and quoting my girlfriend whom I dined with \"cute\". ;)"

Probably some of the best I've had!\n\nThe problem is with how they run/manage their buffet.  This is what will keep me away, unfortunately :(  So it's $13 per person for their buffet, which isn't bad, however, I have a FIVE YEAR OLD son that they want to charge us 8.99 for (which, for some reason, they explain as being \"half price\" even though the math doesn't add up there..).\n\nHere's the problem, I tried telling the people working, my son will NOT eat ANYTHING besides a plate of rice.  Literally.  That's it.  Even though *I* love their food, my son is such a picky eater (moms, I know you feel me!) and all he will eat is rice.  \n\nI see no reason why I should pay $9 for my child to eat a plate of rice.  It's really ridiculous that they won't take the time to listen or understand.  Why can't they just charge me what they'd normally charge for a side of rice?  That would be so simple.  I get it, they don't know me, and they don't know that's really all my son will eat - so WATCH US!  LOL!  \n\nAnyway, I wish I could eat here, but call me stubborn, an $9 plate of plain rice isn't worth it to me :/"

Ever since I was about 9 years old and ate a horrific piece of cold fried chicken at the Circus Circus buffet, I pretty much avoid them unless they're being paid for or someone I know really wants to go with them.  For a while this even extended it to restaurants I liked or cuisines I enjoyed that offered buffets.   I would skip those and order a la carte.   \n\nWith my recent love for Mt Everest's lunch buffet and my complete obsession over Indian food in general, I figured it was time to venture out and try another.   I'm ridiculously smart for this decision, because Mint blew me away at lunch today.\n\nWe were seated and offered a choice of naan and I ordered an iced tea before going up to grab a plate.  Naturally I skipped over the fruits and veggies on the first cart and went right to the rice, pakoras, and varieties of dals, curries, and chicken dishes.  First thing I noticed that I appreciated wholly was that each item had notations on whether they were vegan, vegetarian, had glucose, or had jain.  One of the friendly servers heard my friend and I seemingly confused over what that even was and she explained it (people who dont/cant eat garlic or onions?  Perish the thought!)  I annoyed her with my lactose intolerance issue as I do everyone that I encounter in a food establishment, but still took my chances with just about anything that didn't say \"paneer\" on it.  My goal at Indian buffets now is to never return for a 2nd plate.  Of course this just means that I have a mountain of food on my one and only plate, and Mint was no exception.   If I went back for seconds they probably would have closed down for the day.  Pretty sure I was triple stacking items and just letting them all ooze together.  It's like an fountain drink suicide indian style.  The only negative I can think of on selection this day was no samosas.  Seemed like a greek joint without falafels.\n\nGot back to the table with my iced tea waiting and a basket of fresh, hot naan followed shortly after.   EVERY single bite was delicious.  I wish I could go into greater detail on each component, but it wouldnt be adequate.  I probably had 12 different items on my plate, and I repeat:  EVERY bite was delicious. \n\nPrice was standard and worth every penny.   One final exemplary service note which might have just been circumstantial, but on the receipt it noted that the naan was with (no butter).   I think the woman that was working at the front of the line may have informed our waiter to hold the butter on the naan as she overheard the two lactose intolerant weirdos in line discussing it.   Way to make us feel welcomed!\n\nGotta go 5 on this one.   Though I'm starting to wonder if there are any Indian restaurants here in town I DONT like...."

            "review": "My friends and I were looking for a place to have dinner on Saturday night in Las Vegas. One of the girls looked up this place on her iphone and we decided to give it a try after we saw the raving reviews on Yelp. \n\nFood: I ordered a chicken saag paneer (aka chicken with spinach) and it came with an order of rice. I also ordered some garlic naan (Indian bread). The total for both including a 22% tip was $20 bucks. I had water with my meal. Food was great and the ingredients tasted fresh. I wouldn't say it's the best I've had since I've had comparable and better in the Bay Area (California) excluding price or portion. 3.5-4 stars for the food.\n\nService: Service could be improved. We asked if we could get out of the restaurant within an hour when we ordered. Waiter was eager and enthusiastic about getting us out on time to our 10pm show. 1 hour later (9pm), food barely started arriving. We ate quickly and was able to get out around 9:30pm. Considering that there weren't mainly people besides us (granted there was 1 large party and a couple small tables), they could have and should have been much faster at getting our orders out. Slow and not that responsive. 2 stars.\n\nLocation: It's off strip and cost our party about $10 dollars from the Flamingo to the restaurant. Considering the cost of strip food, the taxi ride breaks it even. Keep in mind that you must call for a cab or else it's rather difficult to catch a cab back onto the strip. Try to get the cab company # beforehand and call 15 minutes before you plan to leave the restaurant so that one will show up 15 minutes later (maybe make that 20 minutes considering ours was \"late\"-- even though we called 30 minutes in advance. 10 minutes passed its prime, we decided to flag another cab.\n\nAmbiance: Average. Nothing out of the ordinary. A bit dark in some areas as well, but without justification for mood.\n\nPayment: Takes credit card."

We stayed til closing (11:30 pm). \n\nWhen you get into the restaurant and you don't have a reservation, you'll have to add your name to a wait list. When they're ready for you they'll give you a call. That part was kinda cool. We didn't have to wait long, but I was surprised there were a good number of people already on the wait list. They were pretty busy on a random Wednesday night.\n\nThe complimentary papadum was nice. It was a good way to begin our meal. \n\nIf you love spice, try the paneer tikka masala at a 7. You'll get some good heat and some tasty curry. There was no need to add extra cayenne to this dish.\n\nThey've also got some flavorful lamb rogan josh here if you're into lamb.\n\nTip: If you enjoy spice, but don't like it too hot, don't order \"medium\" because it'll be a little on the bland side. I should have given a number like a \"5\" or a \"6\" because the chicken tikka masala I got at medium could have used a lot more kick. \n\nOverall, 5 stars for the paneer tikka masala at a 7. Minus 1 star because it took a little long to get our food."

I was craving for chicken tikka masala, & according to yelp, this is the highest rated Indian restaurant in the area (thanks, Yelpers). I easily found the place; it was right off the strip, & there was ample parking. As soon as I walked in, I was immediately greeted by one of the waiters & shown to a table even though it was slightly busy. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated & has such a warm, exotic feel to it. There were about four or five groups of people seated throughout, but there were many available tables.\n\nThe waiter brought me a menu, & I told him that I would be ordering my meal to go. He was very friendly & was smiling along with the other employees. I quickly felt at home & opened up the menu. My mouth dropped open. The menu is huge. They have all kinds of dishes from different parts of India & other southeastern Asian countries. Each item had a tempting, mouthwatering description of the dish's contents. I knew what I had come for, but I couldn't help but look over the delicious selection of foods that they had to offer. A couple minutes later, the nice waiter man returned to take my order. He was so friendly it felt like I was actually getting the full service that a customer who dines in would get. I pointed out the dishes I wanted, which were the Maharaja Tikka Masala with chicken breast & garlic naan stuffed with cheese. I also asked for rice on the side. The waiter was quick to show me a variety of fried rice options on his iPad, all of which had mouthwatering (my mouth was really watering) pictures. I wasn't sure which one to pick--I wanted them all, so he recommended the Schezwan Fried Rice.\n\nAbout ten to fifteen minutes later, the waiter returned with my package of food & the tab. After paying (& leaving a tip because they were so kind!), I rushed home to taste the food I had been dreaming about for days.\n\nI got to my kitchen & opened the bag. First thing I noticed is that they had triple wrapped my naan in foil & wax paper to preserve the texture & heat of the naan! Then I saw that my tikka masala was in a plastic container that they had also double sealed in seran wrap! How awesome is that?! I've ordered to-go from many restaurants, but I've never seen anyone so carefully wrap the food as well as they do!! Next, I saw two round foil containers & wondered, hey, I thought I had ordered only one more thing. I opened one & saw my Schezwan Fried Rice, which was still steaming (I drove home in rush hour traffic--hence my amazement). I opened the other & saw steaming hot Basmati rice!! WOW!! I thought to myself, they've already impressed me immensely with their awesome customer service & food wrapping abilities, the food must be even greater!\n\nAnd man, I'm telling you, I was not at all disappointed. In fact, I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!! I started with the garlic naan stuffed with cheese--that naan was better than sex!! The texture was warm, crisp, buttery & garlicky on the outside, & hot & super cheesy on the inside!! I don't know how to describe it. It was so goddamn GOOD!!!!!! I couldnt put it down for the life of me, but I knew I had to start on the tikka masala.\n\nThe Maharaja Tikka Masala.\n\nGoodness gracious.\n\nAs soon as I dipped the delicious naan in that tikka masala & shoved the two in my mouth, I knew I had found a new religion. That tikka masala is the best thing that's been in my mouth in YEARS. Trust me, I've eaten all kinds of food from all over, & this, my friends, is where it's at!!! I think my neighbors heard me moaning as I ate. It was just that damn good!! The chicken breast was cooked perfectly, so so so perfectly. It was juicy, tasty & delicious. There are no words to describe my mouth's experience with that chicken. It was as if that chicken had led a good life, died happily, & went to heaven, which is where my mouth was at that moment!\n\nLast, but definitely not least, is the Schezwan Fried Rice. That waiter guy who recommended this to me deserves a raise. In fact, he deserves an award of some sort, cuz my goodness, that rice. That rice, people. It was beyond amazing. I had ordered it with shrimp, & you know, normally when you order shrimp fried rice from a restaurant, you expect baby shrimp, even from the high-end restaurants. But no. Mint Indian Bistro did not conform in this case--they rebelled!!! The shrimp in the Schezwan fried rice was gigantic!!! It was not only huge--it was tasty, juicy, crisp, fat-- cooked to perfection!!! I was not expecting that at all because normally fried rice is made of leftover ingredients, but no way is that fried rice made of leftovers!!! Goddamn. It was so good, I wanted to go back & give that nice waiter guy a hug!!!\n\nThis is the only Indian restaurant that I'll be eating at while I live here :)"

The dal was delicious enough to warrant two helpings. The selection was great with three soups, a salad selection, approximately 4 vegan and an additional vegetarian paneer dish, plus 4 or 5 meats and a selection of deserts.

The floor was dirty and I could notice food particles lying down the floor at several places.\n- Taste? Not so good. I can get better food elsewhere in below average restaurants.\n\nThere are several better places in Vegas if you want to try out Indian food. Just avoid this one."

            "review": "There used to be a couple of wonderful Nepalese restaurants in the Detroit Metro area, and I've missed them sorely since they closed.  Mint's Nepalese offerings made this a must-stop place during business & pleasure trips to Vegas, and I've been here several times.  This latest visit in May of 2012 found Mint as more fusion-oriented than I remembered it; they appear to have dropped some of the Nepalese dishes, which made me sad.  However, we found a great deal at Mint to be happy about.\n\n1) Lassi bar.  Both my husband's mint lassi (not sweet) and my blackcurrant lassi (sweet) were sublime.  The color, the flavor, and the texture were all just perfect.  We did not have liquor in either lassi.\n\n2) Drinks list is extensive, with many beers I remember fondly from my visits, including a wonderful lambic, a beer named \"Troubadour Obscura,\" and a bock that is probably one of the best beers I've ever tasted.\n\n3) Diverse menu-- mostly Indian with some Chinese, Tibetan, and Nepalese-influenced dishes-- with many can't-fail choices.\n\nI've enjoyed the \"Rebel Curry\" on a previous visit, but this time we had the momos-- delicate meat-filled dumplings similar to a potsticker, served with a spicy tomato-based sauce.  I had the tamarind rice, a vegetarian offering that worked well as an entree after the course of momos.  My husband had the chicken Chau Chau-- one of the Tibetan noodle dishes-- and a bowl of the delicious noodle soup.  I had the warm sweet carrot Halwa for dessert and my husband had kulfi; our two fellow guests, both newcomers to Tibetan and Nepalese food, both enjoyed the Chau Chau with shrimp and the lamb momos.  \n\nService was spotty-- the server had to be asked three times to provide lemon wedges for our water, and frequently missed at least one person at our four-person table when providing refills or removing dishes.  And during almost every course-- beer, entree, dessert-- we encountered the news that something we'd ordered wasn't available at that moment (no Ras Malai or Hakka noodles), so each of were eating and drinking our \"second best\" picks for at least one course out of the menu.  The dessert I ordered wasn't available and the server took it upon himself to bring me out mango kulfi instead, which was a nice gesture but a terrible idea, as I am allergic to mangoes and had previously indicated I did not want mangoes in my iassi.  Dishes are presented attractively on four-cornered white plates but presentation isn't really exceptional.\n\nIn spite of these hiccups, we had a very good time, which goes to show how excellent the food and drink here are.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be heading to Flamingo Rd for another lassi and a plate of momos."

I guess it makes sense if you're taking your dad out for lunch... but my boyfriend isn't a father, and the majority or our party was female.

I'm more critical now and an establishment has to go way above and beyond expectations or be the best I've had in its category. Unfortunately, Mint Indian Bistro is THE best Indian food I have EVER had, period!\n\nI know, my life sucks! All I want to do is give a critical review, but I keep having outstanding experiences.\n\nWhen I opened the menu and saw dosas in the appetizers, I knew I was about the experience something special. Dosas!!! My use of redundant punctuation should indicate the percentage exceeding one-hundred that represents how much I love a good dosa!!! Mint has giant flaky dosas filled with many different types of awesomeness.\n\nBoth Southern and Northern Indian recipes are included on the menu, as well as Tibetan and Nepalese entree selections. I know of nothing like this back home in Seattle. If someone else does, please tell me! This place was great from beginning to end. \n\nI don't do dessert at Indian restaurants so I can't speak to that, but I did have a delicious Blackberry Lassi which I can say served a dual purpose as dessert/beginning of the evening cocktail.\n\nThey have a lunch buffet, but I didn't get to do that since my friend is a bit of a germophobe about buffets. \n\nSo, in conclusion, best, awesome, great, and delicious! I'll have to wait another day at different restaurant to be comfortably critical. I can always go back to Chutney's back home, I guess."

Unfortunately, few of these were related to the food itself.\n\nThe good - they bring you a carafe of water and leave it on the table so you can refill your own glass.  This is really nice when eating spicy Indian food (of which there was none here.)  The restaurant is very clean and attractive, the service is very friendly.  They bring naan fresh to your table and the naan was good.\n\nThe bad - Most of the buffet was bland, bland, bland.  And I don't mean just 'not spicy' bland, but 'no flavor' bland.  The tikka masala was gloppy, like the cream in it had curdled, but it had little flavor.  I was SOOO excited to see goat curry (my favorite dish ever!) on the buffet... but it was bland, bland, bland.  The meat was good but the curry...nonexistant.  The saag was downright horrible - the worst I've ever had.  Everything tasted like they'd forgotten salt (and I don't like overly salted food).  The creamy tofu curry had no flavor.  The kheer was also pretty dreadful.  They use rice angel hair instead of rice, so it had a slimy wormy consistency and the runny 'sauce' did not taste good.  I usually love kheer but I took one bite and that's it.\n\nThe indifferent - the gulab jamun was about average though I couldn't taste any cardamom in the simple syrup, which is a letdown.  The dal was subtly flavored but not too bad.  The best dishes on the buffet were the 'chili chicken' (tasted like mexican-indian fusion but actually had some flavor) and the 'veggie chow chow' which is some sort of noodle dish that didn't really remind me of any Indian food, but didn't taste bad.\n\nThe buffet was about $11 per person.  There were a surprising number of indo-pak folks in here, surprising because of how bad the food was.  Normally at the places I frequent in other cities that have a lot of indo-pak clientele, the food is very spicy and flavorful (sometimes too spicy for my pansy white arse even).  But here, it was like the baby-food bland version of everything.  Why were they here?  Is this really the best Indian food available in Vegas?  I shudder to think that is the case.  I hope they were just having a bad day but honestly the food wasn't good enough for me to want to find out, despite the nice touches of fresh naan and abundant water."

My aunt and uncles also own a couple of Indian restaurants and I've had Indian food when I've visited India so I know how the food should taste. I went to there lunch buffet which is ten dollars ( not a bad price for a buffet in Vegas). Now even though the price is low, that doesn't mean the quality of food should be low. When I went i noticed that the food was cold and that the containers in which they house re food were all open. This is very bad because that food is exposed to air and bacteria the entire time that the buffet is being served. The food also didn't have any flavor(the somasa were round and only had potatos, they were more like thick potato chips and the chicken tikka masala was very plain and didn't have any sweetness or spice). Indian food should be either spicy or somewhat sweet, it should never be flavorless. When it came time to pay, I had to wait ten minutes because the two guys at the register were on there cell phones and very slow to process my bill. I left them a 4 dollar tip and as I was leaving one of the workers says bye to me all while still on his cell phone, this in unacceptable customer service. If you want to try Indian food, I recommend you try some other place because there are many other Indian restaurants in Las Vegas"

            "review": "Came here with the wife last night, because we were in the mood for some Indian food. I've also heard rave reviews about this place (they've won numerous accolades for best Indian food of Las Vegas). \n\nThe place was packed when we walked in. The atmosphere is very dim, has somewhat of a bar/lounge feel to it. They do have a bar section specifically labeled the Lassie Bar. There were about 3 parties ahead of us, and after waiting for about 20 minutes, we decided to take a seat at the bar. We asked the server/bartender if we could order food here and then move to a table once a spot opens up. He said that once you order food, it will be difficult for us to do that. Seriously? It would take less than a minute to exchange that. Very poor customer service right there. We just ordered a glass of pinot noir and a mango lassie and waited another 20-25 minutes for our table to open up. \n\nThe whole night basically consisted of us waiting, waiting, and waiting some more. I don't mind waiting, but the servers never said a word about the food coming out late or apologizing for the food being really slow. They seemed to be lacking employees either out on the restaurant or in the kitchen. The parties next to kept looking around as well, because they weren't getting their food either. We ended up waiting about 40 minutes for our food after we placed our order. \n\nThe food was above average. The butter garlic naan was a miss. It wasn't soft, and it was lacking the garlic flavor. The Maharaja chicken tikka masala (spicy level 4) was really flavorful, and the chicken was tender. It had the right amount of spiciness too. The lamb vindaloo (spicy level 6) was ok; the lamb was really soft and juicy, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce. The tomato flavor was too strong in this dish. \n\nWe should have come here for their lunch buffet before trying their dinner menu. It's probably a better bang for your buck. I'll consider giving their lunch buffet a shot before ever coming back for dinner."

This is a great way to sample different dishes without having to order the entire restaurant. But, Indian food is not for those with a low tolerance for spicy (hot) food. The fresh naan is wonderful and great for dipping in these flavorful dishes because most entrees do contain a good amount of heat (probably 3-4 On a Thai 1-5 scale). Worth checking out and they open at 11AM which reservations aren't really recommended till after 12PM."

The same servers have been here since I've started coming here and the manager is really nice, great staff.\n\nThe food is bomb and always has been. Best Tandoori chicken I've ever had, period.

Is it worth the hour long wait one time, when the line was out the door and had to wait a super long time for a lunch at 2pm on a thursday... ehh??? The buzz must have gotten out cause this place was packed for lunch.  The garlic naan is super fresh and keeps coming out when asked for.  The selections at the buffet are all tasty and good.  My go to indian food is always chicken tikka, tandori, rice and goat curry which are all good here. The tandori is not too dry (which happens often for indian buffets I noticed) and the goat curry has lots of actual goat meat.  Spicy factor is definitely there so be warned!! I also ordered a mango lassi but that was ok, I think it was a pre-made from a carton though, boo :( which is a little disappointing.  The only issue is when it's packed, the service gets a little slower and the wait is pretty long since people do not want to leave without getting more than their money's worth.  You know a place is super good when it's native people are taking over the place, not trying to be racist but this place was FULL of indians and their huge families... so it must be good right?!  Don't miss out on this place and lunch is very good cheap eats for great food!!"

Going to vegas, people always rave about the food, but I've never really found anything food wise that I cant live without.\n\nI am a vegetarian for almost 9 years now and most buffets are meat/seafood heavy and I just don't see the value in paying for salad.  That makes indian food a really attractive option for me. I was with 7 other people and we settled on indian after a little bit of back and forth negotiations.\n\nI am really glad we did!  First, its a little off the strip so parking was easy to find.  Coming with 8 people isn't always easy to accommodate without reservations but Mint was more than accommodating.  \n\nWe had excellent service.  We had a free appetizer and our glasses were always filled before we had to ask. \n\nThe menu was fairly extensive.  There were a lot of options, including many of the traditional indian favorites: naan, kormas, masalas, etc.\n\nThe portions were generous, served quickly and hot.  My veggie korma was really good.  All around everyone was very happy with the dishes they ordered. \n\nSome of the items we ordered included: \n\nVeggie Korma\nLamb Korma\nNaan- Garlic and Plain\nRice\nDinner special menu set 1\nMango Lassis\nAnd Chicken Masala. \n\nThe korma was smooth and not gritty.  Gritty korma is a pet peeve of mine.  The dinner set came in traditional metal serving trays with many little sides.  They didn't make a fuss in my request to substitute 2 of the meat options for vegetarian options.  The vegetables were cooked correctly and not mushy/overcooked.  \n\nThe spice level was low for me but I also have a very high spice tolerance.  Everyone else seemed to think it was around medium spicy. \n\nWe split the check in 2, which they didn't give us any heartache about.\n\nI'd recommend it as a nice, calm place to get a solid, tasty, dinner while in Vegas- especially if you have a larger group and don't want to fight with the long lines at buffets.  Also Mint is really vegetarian friendly.  All in all, a great experience. =)"

My mother's usual Indian buffet place, IHO, is just not very good. But she would always go there because it's \"what she knows,\" and she was comfortable with it. This day, I suggested we try someplace else, and she was open to it. As soon as we got there, she kept stating how everything was so good, even better than \"her\" Indiana buffet place!!\n\nI ordered a Mango Lassi, and it was very good. Not as sweet as some I have had in the past, which is a plus. They have a small veggie/chutney/soup area. The food was hot and fresh. The tandoori chicken is delish. It is not the best I have had, but for buffet, it is really close. Throw a little mint chutney on it, a squeeze of lemon..... Mmmm. Yum.\n\nThey bring out hot, just-made Nan for you as well, which is very nice. I rip off pieces of the nan, and use my hands to scoop up my food. I am used to eating with my hands, since Africans also use a food (fufu) to scoop up other food with. I saw one other person eating with their hands there, so I felt a bit less weird doing it, but most used utensils.\n\nIt is usually a little warm inside, so wear layers you can take off.

Sadly that was not the case. :(\n\nFirst minus 1 star - for the annoying fly buzzing around the table... Yes that is a natural thing that they can't really control but it started my dinner there on a wrong note.... So let me add one more thing onto this one to make it more even for anyone that is keeping count....:). After they dropped off the entrees they didn't check back on us even tho there were only 3 other tables... And we had to actually yell across the restaurant to get some water as all the hand waving and polite excuse me fell on deaf ears. :( Service (1/5)\n\nMinus 1 star - I ordered roti and it came out like a thick tortilla... What happened to the layers?? All the roti that I have ever gotten were light and flaky. This one was thick like really thick tortilla that was very under seasoned. This was just a chewy piece of under seasoned tortilla. It was better after I started dipping it into the sauces that came with my papadum. Still was not very appetizing. :( Food (1/5)\n\nMinus 1 star - I ordered my Rebel curry at level 10... When I got it... It was a level 1 not spicy at all. Disappointment since the server even warned me that it was spicy... My friend that I was eating dinner with even agreed that it was not spicy either. Food (1/5)\n\nMinus 1 star - they left huge pieces of a spice.... I'm guessing star anise in my curry that was inedible. Either fish it all out as I understand that the curry needs the spice or ground it up so that I'm not biting into it as I'm trying to \"enjoy\" my dinner. Food (1/5)\n\nMinus 1 star - for not having the inferno menu. They couldn't tell me when I placed the order. They took my order and then 10 minutes later told me that they were out of the chilis.... but there was no communication about that at anytime at all until 10 minutes after I ordered it. I'd figure that if it was something that u are known for that u wouldn't run out. That's what I think maybe I'm wrong... But this is my review... So minus 1 star\n\nAmbiance was ok. It wasn't spectacular... It wasn't dirty... It was just ok...(2.5/5)\n\nSo overall with my first impression mixed with my second \"not impressed at all\" impression....I will never be going back. I will not waste one more penny at this place. It just was not worth it... And by my count they should be at a 0 star from me. Way too many other BETTER Indian restaurants in town to waste my time at this place."

Also said they own a software company and are going to start using their own app in some time.\n\nComing to the main part! FOOD! It was really good. \nWe ordered Mint Lassi and Masala Chhas. Both were very Indian and really tasty. \nTheir Menu is very well organized. Great for Vegetarians and Vegans since each item says if its good for vegetarians or vegans. Very happy to see how they describe each item in the menu really well. One of the best organized Menu's among all restaurants (Comparing to all Indian, American etc. restaurants).\n\nFor the main course we ordered Paneer Makhani, Daal Makhani and Chole With Naans. Everything was really good. Daal Was very tasty, although the color might make you think its not the best, but trust me the taste is nothing short of what you find back home. Naan's were also very good. \n\nThey also have Nepalese  food but did not try it, but would love to try that too. \nOverall great place if you are looking for true Indian Food. Would definitely go back again."

Fortunately, we found Mint Indian Bistro, a mile south of the LVCC.  We shared the Indian Sampler (around $30), which was incredibly flavorful and delicious.  Our friendly servers, Rajeev and Biru (who are from Nepal), gave us a lesson on the similarities and differences between Nepalese and Indian cuisines...something we found intriguing!  When we're traveling, we typically like to try different restaurants during our stay.  However, we made an exception and came back to try Mint Indian Bistro's all-you-can-eat buffet the next day...Rajeev's and Biru's hospitality coupled with the food we enjoyed made that an easy choice.\n\nWhen I return to Vegas, I'll definitely come back to Mint Indian Bistro! :-)"

We've only tried the lunch buffet thus far but the flavors are consistent with their original location. \n\nThe way things are set up here are different as there is much more space (able to accommodate larger parties and functions perhaps?) and there is a self serve beer and wine bar where you can try the 2 wines and 6 beers they have on tap using a card to pay for 2 oz servings.\n\nThere is nothing like their chili chicken and their paneer korma and tikka masala! They actually even make fresh naan right in front of you in the buffet area!  I'm also a fan of their goat curry and I'm so happy to have a location closer to my house, not to mention, closer to my office!\n\nYou have to come here and give it a try!

            "review": "Have I ever told you that Indian food is my absolute favorite?  Okay, so I'll tell you again.  I've been eating Indian food since before many of you Yelpersnappers were ever born.  When I moved from Brooklyn to Queens, I was fortunate to be living a stone's throw from Jackson Heights, which was then cradle of Indian restaurants on the East Coast. It still may be.\n\nBut I moved from there to Central NJ, and all those restaurants must have heeded me and Horace Greeley, and moved west.  They all went to Edison, which became known as Little Bombay (or Mumbai, if you're a purist).  But there were - and are - also a plethora of Gujurati vegetarian joints, as well as tons of places from almost every Indian state. They've been moving west again, and now we have a growing Indian food scene here in Vegas.\n\nMint Indian Bistro on Durango is one of the newest, and it's a cavernous room, half of which is filled with tables and booths, the other dedicated to a bar and lounge, with a unique Lassi Self-Serve wine and beer station in the center.\n\nWe chose a table far from the door, but we were freezing.  Our obliging waiter, Jay, raised the thermostat, but that only seemed to be blowing cold air.  Turns out that our table was next to the somewhat separated buffet station area, and that must have had its own thermostat turned way down, because we got even colder.  We moved to a raised booth, and I was finally able to settle in and take my jacket off.  Even better, the booth was the right height and very comfortable.  I usually can't sit in them, since I'm too short for most and would have to eat like a dog, straight outta the bowl, and the tables are most often too far away from the seat.  This one was perfect.\n\nNo other reviews seem to be complaining, but I found the wine and beer prices over the top.  I won't pay $10 for a glass of Riesling, even if it's from Germany, unless I'm on the Strip and dying of thirst.  I've had too many good German ones at other places for a lot less.  So I had a small bottle of bubbly, and I was happy.\n\nWe like it when there's a Thali, especially when it's a new restaurant for us, because we get to sample more than a few items.  Here it's called a Prix-Fixe menu (for two), under the heading of Chef's Tasting Menu which, I guess, gives license to let them charge more!  But it is definitely a Thali, and we chose the non-Vegetarian option.  To be fair, it was somewhat different from the usual, in that we were served individual bowls of soup and individual desserts.\n\nWe started with the tomato soup, very flavorful with lots of cumin seeds to crunch on.  It seemed insanely oversalted, but I'm hoping that instead of salt it was from lemon.  It's easy to confuse the two in certain dishes.  The soup was served along with the appetizer, which we were able to change from pakoda to samosa.  The potato and pea filling was delicious, but I found the outside to be not as crisp as at other places, with a kind of different, softer texture.\n\nThe main course was accompanied by a separate small bowl of rice.  Rice was also one of the bowls on the tray.  The individual dishes were very good (lamb, vegetable curry, dal,) to excellent - tandoori chicken that had an unusually great smoky taste, and chicken tikka masala.  We didn't like the mixed pickles, but that doesn't mean they weren't good, they're just not our thing.  Yogurt instead of raita was a disappointment, but not as disappointing as the garlic naan.  It wasn't piping hot, which it should be, didn't have enough garlic, and desperately need some butter - it had none.\n\nMuch as we like gulab jamun, we chose kheer for dessert, since it's not as cloyingly sweet.  It was terrific.\n\nService was generally good.  While Jay seemed to be the primary waiter, everyone else pitched in.  But the problem was that when we, or any other table, weren't being served, the staff seemed to hang out in the kitchen.  So when we needed, e.g., spoons for the dal or yogurt, since none were provided, we had to wait, and wait some more, until someone decided to come into the dining room.\n\nThis venue has been open a month.  They will have wi-fi, but don't yet.  The food is mostly very good, and I hope the owner will check out all the previous comments, as well as my own, and work out the kinks.  We liked it and will come back, but it's not my favorite.  That could easily change."

Should probably get the brain checked out\n\nTheir ambitious, new west side location is HUGE.  The open space is well designed and would make for a rockin party full of people and lassi showers.  But on a random Tuesday night with a total of 6 customers in the place, we looked like detainees in an empty nightclub being served delicious food to pass the time.\n\nAnd delicious was definitely my key word for their dosa!  Hard to find for dinner around these parts, consider me all-in when this fantastic South Indian delicacy is available.  Their \"Butter Masala Dosa\" works great as either an entr\u00e9e or an appetizer for 4.  Stuffed with spiced potatoes, cheese and onions, this 2.5 foot \"prince of carbs\" will undoubtedly get appetites revved up for what else is to come.  The paper thin crispiness and rich buttery flavor in every bite of this huge crepe is simply delightful.  The curries we sampled were all solid as well with the \"Maharaja Tikka Masala\" being my favorite on this most recent visit.  I also love their korma and vindaloo.\n\nEven though I favor dinner over the lunch buffet at their original location, this new area looks absolutely stellar and offers a more expansive selection that I eagerly await digging into soon!"

The chana masala is a great vegan/vegetarian option. Even if you are not vegan/vegetarian, you will definitely enjoy it. It is full of flavor and has the right amount of kick to it (I ordered spicy level 4). The vindaloo was also very tasty. It has a slight vinegary flavor, in my opinion, but it is delicious nonetheless. \n\nOut of all the Indian restaurants in town, I would recommend Mint because their service was exceptional and the establishment is very clean. Other places might have decent food, but their restaurant is not always in tip top condition, which can kind of bring your appetite down. Overall, Mint has all of the aspects I look for in a great restaurant. Must try!"

The service was off which resulted in me removing a star from my earlier review.\n\nThe food was excellent!  The Andhra curry with chicken was beautifully spiced.  I got it at a spice level of 7 on a 1-10 scale.  I could have done eight or nine.  There was some kick but I like it spicier, not inferno, but reasonably spicy for normal people.  The samosas were good with good ground lamb and the basmati rice was well prepared.  The garlic naan rounded out a nice meal along with the gulab jamun for dessert.\n\nNow to the service.  When I arrived, there were two tables besides me occupied.  There were perhaps four people covering the floor.  One man took by order for the samosas while I looked at the menu trying to decide on the main course.  He also asked for my drink order.  I asked for iced tea and he responded with sweet or unsweetened.  Unsweetened it was and he brought me a small dish with some regular sugar and several artificial sweetener packs.  Shortly into eating the samosas, when my tea wasn't even down a third, a server asked if I wanted a tea refill.  I responded with a not right now.\n\nI finished the samosas, the curry, and my gulab jamun before someone picked up the empty glass--it had been for much of my meal by then--and brought it back full.  I added a packet of sweetener and then tasted this awful flavor because they had brought the sweetened tea which now had artificial sweetener also in it.  It tasted like raspberry tea but I only took a swallow or two and then left the rest.\n\nThere was a woman going around with a tablet taking orders from tables which are then instantly sent to the kitchen.  She seemed to be the key employee tonight.  When I was brought my bill, I saw that there was a large error.  The gulab jamun was charged at $80.  (I did not post the photo of that bill but I have it).  The person who brought the check went after the tablet carrier who then was occupied with a party of 4 at the \"self serve\" by the ounce wine and beer area.  I can see why it can't be completely self serve.  I have friends who would drink them dry unless monitored.  This, however, held up the redoing of the bill.\n\nThe service seemed like there was no coordination nor clear cut responsibilities.  No dirty dishes were removed from the table except for the samosa one.  All my dishes from the main course were on the table when the gulab jamun was brought.  I lifted my dinner plate to make room and placed it to the left and away from the eating area.  The person who brought the gulab then picked up that plate and took it but nothing else was ever cleared from the table while I was there.   It's been a month so they have had time to train the staff and the staff has had time to do their jobs.  This won't keep me from coming back because the food is so good but service people, you need to get your acts together."
