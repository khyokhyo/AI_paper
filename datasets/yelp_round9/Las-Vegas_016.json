Either way, GET IT IN YOUR STOMACH.\n\nThey have several different combo options available, with a wide variety of delicious side dishes to choose from. I always choose from their smaller combo options (usually their pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese or beans) because, well, to be quite honest, even then, there is SO MUCH FOOD."

            "review": "Sad to say that this place has gone \"corporate\" and this is no longer a must go destination when in Vegas.  I get it, as this is a business and we all need to make your money but...\n\nGone is the mom and pop feel and the prices have increased accordingly and no longer a screaming bargain.  Some examples: they charge $3 for drinks, I could barely finish my meal before but now can so quite comfortably (but still is filling), I was never asked how my food was and when ordering, I was not given any suggestions or descriptions on their menu choices.\n\nOrdered the meat trio $17.99:\n\nBaby back ribs are not no longer fall off the bone and a bit dry.  The BBQ chicken is soft and tender but the smoky flavor and seasoning didn't sink into the meat.  The beef brisket is still pretty good but was chopped too much.\n\nIf you don't mind driving and for really good BBQ for dirt cheap prices, I suggest John Mull's in North Las Vegas."

            "review": "Working in kitchens most of my life, ive been exposed to bbq from memphis, texas, north carolina, ect. This place is okay. The service was fast, food came out quick, but it just fell flat. Brisket was dry and along with pulled pork, you gotta coat it in sauce just to get it down. Ribs and chicken were good, great smoke flavor on both but 30 minutes later you still have a smokey taste in your mouth (usually indicates usage of liquid smoke). Hot link was mediocre. Mac and cheese lacked seasoning and needed more cheese in the sauce, slaw was good and the beans were also nice. Overall it was a disappointment. Save yourself some money and go to roadkill grill, better bbq, well seasoned food and lower prices."

The prices here are pretty good too! \n\nWe ordered a few things to try, but my favorites were the burnt ends and St. Louis ribs. The St. Louis ribs are dry rubbed and the sweet and spicy sauce was perfect for dipping. My bf liked the vinegar sauce but it wasn't really my thing. We got the brisket three ways but ended up ordering more of the burnt ends because they were really good! \n\nFor our sides, we got the waffle fries, corn nuggets, corn bread, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. I loved all the sides but the corn nuggets were really good! I've never had something like it before, but it's basically creamed corned that's deep fried into nuggets."

That lets you know that this place is jammin.  Apparently you can call in the order and they'll have it ready when you come get it, (total plus in my book).  It's a little confusing to get to, but that shouldn't stop you at all.  \n\nI got the Spudtastic with brisket and a side of Bacon Potato Salad.  Everything was fresh and tasted amazing! This will definitely become a lunch/dinner regular for me.  The line never went down while we were there.\n\nPicnic style seating.  We sat at a table with some other people while waiting for their food and everybody was so nice.  Staff and regulars.\n\nAnybody who says this place is okay, and that  it isn't like \"back home\" is obviously prejudiced to wherever \"back home\" is.\n\nThis place is awesome and definitely worth coming to!!"

            "review": "Finding a authentic homemade bbq place can be tough if you don't live in a southern state. Luckily this is my second find of great bbq. We arrived during the lunch rush. They had a line but it moved pretty quickly and we were able to snag some seats to enjoy our selections. The Woman that took our order was friendly and patient while we decided what to get. Before we got our food my husband made the comment well we found our bbq place closer to home. I told him how does he know we have not tried the food yet. He laughed at me and said the line is out the door you don't get a line like that with just okay food. A waiter brought out our food he was friendly. Our food was fresh and hot, the hotlinks has this snap when you bite them that your looking for when you bite into one of them. The ribs were perfectly seasoned and fell off the bone, the only complaint were they were a tad bit greasy. The chicken was cooked just right and had a nice smoked taste when you bit into it. The okra was hot and fresh and the chipolte dip was great! The brisket was great I always do a roll test where if i can roll it and it does not break apart it's cooked to my liking, they have hands down one of the best briskets i've had. The mac-n-cheese was the disappointment, it was thick and just didn't taste like mac-n-cheese that you would expect with bbq food. I will be back I see why they have the line they have."

More so ones that fellow yelpers rave about. Not sure the last time had some good old fashion ribs. So excited too get down and dirty. Talk about epitome of Hole in the Wall. Industrial Rd not exactly the prettiest road in Vegas but great for gentlemen clubs. Anyway so for second thinking going too one only too pass it and then once did get too Rollin Smoke Barbeque look down the street shocker another one. Once you do get here the smell from the pits literally parked right outside in the parking lot (I have no idea when they start but assume in the morning) and them ribs block out everything. I think Hole in Wall places have so much personality and character ALL its own. \n\nOnce get inside the menu is fairly small but they do have chalkboard with their daily specials. You go up too the cashier too order then they bring the food out too you. You sit wherever you like or have room. They have two room adjacent too one another and other room talk about personality on the walls with the art. How can you not love the boars head or pig head looking over the restaurant from one corner? They do still T-shirts that like the logo but next time go get one of kind T-shirt. \n\nI decided too get The Trio plate. What better way too try little of everything or get my meat in. They out of the hot link so got double order of the pork. My sides went with the mac and cheese. I also ordered side of The Kickin Baked Bean. The pork was excellent! I could easily see myself tearing up pull pork sandwich. Guess is one of there more popular items. The ribs were solid little bit different style then the ones more use too but still solid. Wish could tell you about the hot links but save that for another review. The sides the mac and cheese was really good. It not cheesy cheesy but not runny also so had nice balance. The Kickin Baked Beans now that am FAN. I enjoyed the pieces of pork or beef that in it. I really did have nice little kick spice level too them. Even though it small menu fell like lot more thing for me too try.\n\nThe prices talk about reasonable priced! Compare too some of the other franchise places this place is a steal. You get so much more personality and one of kind experience. Under $20 you can fill yourself up with any combination and still have enough for desserts. The service is awesome! Small business owners that sense the personnel touch all around. It small place so just make sure you beat the crowd cause the place can fill out quick. If never been Rollin Smoke Barbeque someplace check out or fill like mixing up one night. \n\nThanks my partners Mel C and Terri R!!! You guys rock!!"

            "review": "Started off trying out Rollin Smoke Barbecue around two years ago with my wife and a friend. Our experience left a lot to be desired as our ribs were tough, pork was fatty with no taste and chicken was very dry. We decided then to not come back.\n\nFast forward two years and WOW, what a difference, This food is dynamite!!!\n\nLet me start with my favorite menu item, the beef ribs. These things are insane tender with a ton of flavor yet simple, literally fall of the bone, fall apart in your mouth and moist with a great pink smoke ring. The server that brought my food told me it was like \"prime rib on a stick\" and boy was he right! Bring your appetite if you order these, they are huge.\n\nBrisket is darn good as well. Great flavor, nice deep smoke ring and thinly sliced. I have been back three times in the last two weeks (Hi my name is Paul and I'm addicted to good Q) and I have yet to get any point, only flat. I one day will ask them if they are smoking full packers or just the flats. If you ever get the opportunity to get smoked brisket point don't pass it up, it's heaven! (Point brisket is where the \"burnt ends\" come from) \n\nPulled pork is good, but this is where they lost that coveted fifth star from me. I know it's tough to please everyone ( I have been doing BBQ catering for years) but I believe it's a big part of pulled pork to have a finishing sauce added when you pull the shoulder to add that extra level of flavor. I use a home made clear eastern Carolina style finisher on mine and everyone loves it. \n\nIn all this is the best Q restaurant in the valley bar none and I am so happy to see a fellow pit master doing well on his own. While my co workers and I ate lunch today ( 5-1-14 ) the line of people went out the door and never let up the hour we were here. Rock on Rollin Smoke, keep doing it right, you have a loyal customer in me, but only when I'm not doin my own stuff!"

            "review": "Hmph. So I had quite a disappointing experience here, so I'm giving a lower star. \n\nHere's what I had:\n  \nOut law burger- 5 star.  Meat is juicy and flavor is so rich and yummy. Share one with someone. \n \nThe pit Special (4 meats and 3 sides for $20) - brisket, pulled pork, 2 spare ribs, and since the hot links were out i subbed it with baby back ribs for extra cost. \n  Brisket was SOOOOOOOOO good. It was shredded up and looks just like the pulled pork to the point that my bf and I were trying to figure out which was which from our photo.  I didn't like the pulled pork (lacked flavor and was dry) and the spare ribs were okay. \n  \n Sides:  Hush puppies (meh), Corn nuggests (THE DEALIO IS HERE), and kickin beans (yes!) \n\n My bf thought this place was so legit, we went back 2 days later. I asked at the front where you order SHOWING the photo of my original Pit Special plate and asked him which meat was brisket and which one was pulled pork. We wanted to get it right, because one was substantially better tasting than the other. And, it was confusing, since they looked exactly the same shredded up together. He told me that the one that I had liked was brisket. \n\n SO, I order the brisket.  What do I get?  Sliced meat. It didn't look like anything from the photo i had shown or what I had eaten 2 days prior.  Not only did it look different, but It wasn't as juicy and didn't have the same texture. \n  I found out from the server that the brisket comes in two styles (shredded or sliced). It would have been nice for the guy that took the order to specify it for me if that's the case.  AND, I don't know how he can get it wrong after seeing a photo. \n\n  Not to mention, I ordered corn nuggets (cuz that's why i came back 2 days later) and when the server arrived at our table with our food, that was when I found out that they were out of corn nuggets. I had paid additional money for this side. So, I ask this guy how long it'll take to make them (because I was willing to wait for it) and the waiter told me \"several days.\"   \n  My friend went there 2 hours later, and told me there were plenty corn nuggets. WTH dude. I woulda seriously waited 2 hours for my corn nuggets. Or come back in 2 hours for it. But I was told several days, and I was leaving the next day. \n\n  When you're a vegas native and can access a restaurant any day, probably these things don't matter. But, when you're a visitor, a foodie, and you pick a restaurant out of all the choices available, it's disappointing when you don't get what you ordered. \n\n  Next time I go, I shall ask for SHREDDED BRISKET. It's SHREDDED BRISKET versus a BRISKET, y'all!"

You'll see plenty of awards and accolades on their walls inside the (decidedly small) dining area, and you'll soon realize why they've earned them. It may be hard to find, but this place is worth the journey.\n\nThe most important thing I'd recommend is to go there on an odd day, like a tuesday or wednesday night, because on their busier peak periods the food isn't as fresh, I think they may just make huge batches of the common items and put them under heat lamps. If you go there for lunch you're guaranteed the freshest meats. And wow, are they worth it.\n\nThe meats are tender and flavorful, from the ribs that are soft and juicy, to the crisp snap of their spicy sausage. Their sides are to die for, particularly the loaded mashed potatoes and the baked beans. And you absolutely have to save room for dessert, their homemade banana pudding is a gift from the cosmos. It's simply unbelieveable. I'd recommend getting one of their multiple meat platters and sharing it, to get the full spectrum of what's on offer here."

I had the 2-meat platter with an extra side: I picked pulled brisket, spare ribs, mac n' cheese, and loaded mashed potatoes.  Everything was AMAZING.  The brisket was rich, tasty and melt-in-my-mouth, with some interesting hints of sweetness in there: I did add some Arkansauce, which added punch to the flavor.  The ribs (there were supposed to be 2, but there were 3; maybe because I was a first-timer; recommended by the countergirl) needed nothing.  Best ribs I've had, anywhere.  Charred a bit on the outside (with the smoky-salty rub cooked right into the surface of the meat), tender on the inside, came off the bones with little effort.  Loaded mashed potatoes had good flavor to start with; bacon and green onions just added to the richness.  Mac n' cheese was richly cheesy.\n\nBetter than the food was the attention (I came in between lunch and dinner rushes, so 3 other diners and me had the place to ourselves).  I got visited during my meal by the countergirl, the dining room attendant, the manager, and the chef/smokemaster-in-chief.  I didn't have much to say to them, except that I was beyond words at how GOOD everything was.  The boss man was so happy to hear that, that he had a small dessert sent out for me - so I can also tell you that the blueberry cobbler a la mode (he asked what I'd like, and I asked the dining room attendant to surprise me; great choice, dude!) is also fantastic - sweet and just enough tart and tangy.  This was my belated birthday treat to myself, so that was a perfect ending!\n\nThe dining room is simple - benches and trestle tables - cheerful and fastidiously clean.  A great oasis from a rare rainy Vegas day.\n\nDo note: Vegas locals get 10% off our bills when we show locals' ID.\n\nThis is real, local, down-home barbeque at its best.  The friendliness, flavor and authenticity can't be beat by any of the chains.  If you haven't had Rollin Smoke yet, you haven't experienced the rich, off-Strip local foodie scene in Las Vegas."

We were feeling a yen for BBQ after seeing Lyle Lovett & His Big Band over at the Smith Center, so I Yelp-ed Barbecue and the rave reviews for Rollin Smoke made our choice easy.  We arrived a little after 10pm and were told that they were out of meatloaf, yams, cornish hen, burnt ends, and beef ribs.  Since they advertise that they're open until midnight, I thought this was rather extensive a list of food to be out of.  We ordered a combo plate of brisket, chicken, hot links, pulled pork and pork ribs, along with sides of cole slaw, corn bread and corn fritters.  Hubby had the brisket and chicken, neither of which filled him up... kinda small portions of both.  My ribs were tough - not fall off of the bone tender at all.  The pulled pork and links were both OK, not anything special.  The highlight, in my opinion, was the corn bread.  I'd go back for more of that... it almost tasted like it had a coating of honey butter, which was delish.  Hence, the 2 stars."

I'm always down for some good BBQ as she is too so we gave it a go!! As I also looked at the pictures and the comments on Yelp my expectations of this place grew. We pulled Into the parking lot and could smell the aroma of the wood and meat cooking, very promising. We ordered the three way brisket, BBQ nacho fries with pulled pork, and the rack of St Louis spare ribs. The St Louis spare ribs we such a disappointment. They were over smoked and tasted as if the meat had went bad. The brisket was good not great but good and the BBQ nachos were ok as well. But I'm writing this only because I was highly disappointed in the St Louis spare ribs, also I did not find any of their BBQ sauce to my liking!!! Since I did not like the ribs and we had left overs; we brought them home for our kids to try, the 14 year old said, \" Your ribs are better!\" The 9 year old spit hers out!!!!! \n\n\nI would say try it out and make your own opinion!!!"

We were too late for our 15 seconds of fame, but the film crew was still there and it was neat watching them work. It was also not as crowded as I had expected, so it was quick to order and many tables available. The food took a bit longer to come out, but I believe that's standard.\n\nI ordered the \"Duo Choice of Two Meats\" Smokin Plate with Hot Link and 2 Spare Ribs (other meat choices are brisket, pork, or 1/4 chicken), Waffle Fries (there are 16 choices of Smokin Sides), and a drink for $10.99. The sausage or hot link was really tasty and they're not messing around with the heat! If you can't handle spicy food, watch out. I enjoyed the ribs as well, especially with their BBQ sauce. I definitely could've eaten more! I liked their offerings of sweetened and unsweetened iced tea as I mixed the two and had a nice balance.\n\nWe tried a couple cobblers, banana pudding, and the special Reese's PB bread pudding. The cobblers were all right and the banana pudding was decent. The bread pudding was off the hook though! Really good!\n\nI think one of the best parts of their menu is the AYCE option for $24.99. It's offered all day, every day and has no restrictions (except no sharing or to-go, obviously). It's a ridiculous deal for meat! If I can get a few people together, I think that it would be a cool option to order all the types of meat and sides for everyone."

Very tasty and moist. \n\nThey were also out of the baked potato the night we ordered \n\nBrisket.  I ordered 2 lbs to make up for the lack of beef ribs. The brisket was dry and had a very bad after taste that made it taste like old meat that had been. I tried to mask it with the delicious sauce but I couldn't. It wasn't the smoke flavor. It just tasted like old meat that should have been thrown out. \nThe brisket has a very light smoke ring. Little to no bark. It was definitely not winning any awards. \n\nThe sides were all ok. Nothing is ever crave but decent. \n\nI asked them for a variety of sauces but they only included one type. \n\nI'd go back but only because I'm still want to try the ribs.   The brisket was one of the worst I've ever had.  (Two pounds ended up in the trash). The chicken was good but over priced in my opinion."

The next day he was sick and we are guessing it might have been the food.  The seating leaves something to be desired.  I can handle not so fancy seating for some good barbeque.  We sat at picnic tables and unfortunately my back was to where people line up to order.  Several times I got hit in the back by people's arms, purses etc.  People breathing down your back and gawking at what you are eating.  Go to Dave's Barbeque for a better meal.

So once I heard about this place being featured on Travel Channel and highly rated on Yelp I decided this is it. I got about everything on the menu from meatloaf to brisket and dirty rice to baked beans.\n\nThe brisket was wonderful but it definitely needs the sauce which they provide. The chicken is the best I've had. Forget about Peruvian chicken.... Even the best Peruvian chicken in DC can't hold its own. The beef rib was a dry rub which was also moist and had a nice kick. The meatloaf was wow, all meat. The dirty rice was spicy and the Mac and cheese was epic. The corn bread was fantastic too.

I would go to this place just to smell the beautiful, and oh so addictive smells and then head off on my merry way.  Mmmmhmmm.\n\nI have to mention the cornbread right away.  No BBQ joint would be official without some fresh cornbread.  They've got it right and tight!  So right, that I ordered a ton of extra to-go for a party I was attending later in the night.  Even more right, that I asked for a sample while ordering..  Sad, but very true.\n\nWith all the smells, I was a little overwhelmed on what to order.  I had my sides figured out, but my main plate was hard to pinpoint.  I was experiencing one of those \"eyes are bigger than your stomach\" moments..  Oh wells.  After jostling the idea of ribs around for a few, I kept it real and went with the Beef Brisket.  Ribs are tricky and I'm incredibly picky, so I needed to start slow.  :)  No regrets there.  Flavorful and plenty to eat for leftovers.  They offer a few selections on the amount of grub you order, which was neat in my book.  Now, back to the ribs...  They have a variety to choose from cooked according to whatever region in the states.  Loved that!   Next trip:  RIBS!\n\nAs far as sides go, I was also a little overwhelmed in this department as well.   Never overwhelmed in a bad way.  I went all out with the fattiest of the bunch and had the Mac 'n' Cheese, Loaded Mash Potatoes and the Bacon Potato Salad.  Yes, BACON.  POTATO.  SALAD.  #WINNING!\n\nThe service was friendly and they even complimented me on being so small but yet ordering so much.  \"Is this all for you?\"  \"Hell yeah it is.. C'mon now!\"  \n\nCoolest part about this joint (other than the food, of course):  They deliver AND offer party packages where they'll actually wheel their smoker to your party and hook....you....up!   Whaaaaa?! \n\nRollin Smoke has my foodie heart forevs!  \n\n**This is a popular joint, which means.. lines, lines, lines.  Try to skip the food rush and go during a slower time of the day!  Don't get me wrong though, the long lines are worth it in the end."

So, if that's all you care about, read no further.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday I ordered a five meat platter for my wife & I for our thanksgiving, along with a half chicken. The total was around $45.\n\nI was asked if I wanted some sauce with my order...\n\nWell, yeah, of course I do: 'I'll take a little of each,\" I said. \n\nNot only did RS charge me extra for the three sauces, they were half full. I was able to use them on my pulled pork & chopped brisket. However, my chicken, hot links & ribs went without -- essentially wasted.\n\nNow, not only did RS charge me for sauce without telling me, NONE of the three small containers were complimentary. They gave me zero sauce on a $45 order. An order I intended to use for my Thanksgiving meal. That's a 1/4 chicken, a 1/2 chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and hot links with zero sauce included. \n\nUnfortunately, with no sauce, I scrapped those plans and went to Bachanal at Caesars.\n\nI have one issue and one issue only with RS: they do not care about their customers. They do great business, they are always busy and they clearly take that for granted. Their prices are already astronomically high, but to not include sauce (and when you do, you charge without telling, and still come up short) is just bad business. It goes beyond just being 'cheap'; it's a slap in the face.\n\nI support people who appreciate their customers, and I hope you all do as well. If we continue to reward poor service/standards, then what incentives do poorly run establishments have to improve?\n\nI'm very happy to see the influx of quality BBQ popping up around Henderson. Now, I won't have to make the drive to RS for my favorite meal. Even if the quality is a little less, I'll sleep easy knowing I didn't perpetuate poor business. It's a shame because I've brought many folks to RS over the years, and we've generally had good experiences, but when you so blatantly ruin an important meal of mine, I can never forget that. \n\nRollin Smoke is clearly making money. They've raised their prices by at least 25% in two years . Yet, they're too cheap, or they care too little, to complete their meals. \n\nVisit at your own risk."

It's been on my list for a long time and I finally made it down here to see what the hype is all about and I can honestly say the hype is real. I mean you can smell the smoke all throughout the restaurant and all the way outside. We came on a Friday night and it wasn't packed but there were people coming and going the entire time. Me and the boyfriend decided to share a 4 meat combo with three sides which is a really good deal for 19.99. You can sample almost all the meats the have to offer. Almost not all. We chose hot links, pulled pork, spare ribs and brisket. Choosing sides I couldn't decide so quick and they were more than happy to let me sample both the fried okra and the corn nuggets. Easy winner there the corn nuggets are so fricking delicious! Sweet cream corn inside fried crispy with almost a beer batter exterior. The BOMB! We seated ourselves and the food came out not too much longer after. My favorite has to be the ribs. Fall apart tender and just the right amount of smoke. The brisket could have been more tender and the pulled pork was lacking in smoky flavor but still very good. I'm not a fan of hot links but these were pretty good. The greens were delicious and tender and the mac and cheese was very creamy. I prefer a less creamy mac and cheese but it was still good. My favorite were those corn nuggets. I could eat those all day but I don't think that would be a good idea. I asked for some chipotle dipping sauce and it was the perfect condiment. Sweet corn nuggets with a spicy smoky dipping sauce. I guess we were still hungry because. My boyfriend ordered more pulled pork and ribs with greens of course since I had the Mac and cheese. Service was great they called us by name the entire time and were super nice. The food is legit I just wish they had a better location."

I got a small order of ribs and they were good, but not out of this world, and I thought expensive. I believe I paid $16 for 3-4 ribs and a drink. The place is very crowded and you wait in line to order. I went there with friends who wanted to try it. Everyone was satisfied with their meals, but no one was, like, over the moon. If you are a rib fanatic, this might be the place for you, but otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way."

We had the pulled pork, brisket and double spare ribs. Sides were hush puppies, mac & cheese and mashed potatoes.the brisket was good but I enjoyed the pork and ribs mostly. Great smoke taste and I add a bit of the BBQ sauce for extra flavor. All the sides where great. Mac and cheese and hush puppies are where it's at! A bit small in here but great food!"

I was worried that the place would be crowded since I was dinner time but we just beat the rush. \nThe plan was to order the \"pit special\" 4 meats and 3 sides. We got burnt ends, pulled pork, quarter chicken, spare ribs, one beef rib, corn nuggets, loaded smashed potato and bacon potato salad.\nEverything came out in about 3 minutes which was great since I was starving. The burnt ends were delicious the pulled pork a little dry, the chicken breast was moist since most times chicken breast is dry. I tried the spare ribs and my was I surprised they were the best tasting spare rib I ever had. Great smoke and tender. Not hanging off the bone but still on and but so tender and flavorful and it came off the bone with a bite. The beef rib for me was no disappointment either. Big moist and the same as the pork ribs. They were a little fat but that's the way I like them. Probably too fat for some but that is where the flavor is.\nCorn nuggets were good and the other sides were average.\nI would definitely be back next time in town."

This is all you really need if you're a beef rib connoisseur. They give you two Gangster Sized Ribs, a side (mine was the bacon potato salad), a slider bun, and a tasty cool beverage to wash it all down with on tap. The best DAMN BEEF RIBS I've ever had! They were freaken GIANORMOUS!!! Fall off the bone tender. I easily cut them off the bone and it looked like I had two big steaks. I cut off one nice slice and made a rib slider with the bun.

I have to say, I wasn't that thrilled and it may be because of what we order, which was 2 sandwiches - 1 beef brisket and 1 smoked chicken. The beef brisket was very greasy and lacked seasoning this came with waffle fries which were okay- nothing special. The chicken was nice, well seasoned but they were a bit skimpy on the portion and I got a side salad with mine that came with a vinaigrette that was very spicy and certainly not a traditional salad vinaigrette. Overall, good service and decent food but nothing wild."

We tried a bit of everything - beef ribs, St. Louis ribs, babybacks, chopped and sliced brisket, burnt ends, pulled pork and chicken.  All moist, tender and delicious.  The corn nuggets and bacon potato salad were excellent.  I'm a bit on the fence over the different BBQ sauces.  They were tasty, not bad...just different.  Inside and outside seating.  We got there very early and had no wait, but the lines quickly fill up.  I'll be back when we're in Vegas."

To the extent it may add a little sizzle to the bbq fire, I've judged a lot of KCBS sanctioned bbq contests over the years, and I can state without hesitation that this is terrific bbq.  5 star all the way.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Chef Will while I was there, and told him I thought he was definitely an expert bbq chef, and that his work rivaled the best of the best bbq places in the country.  Interestingly, one of my favorite dishes from Chef Will was the beef ribs, something that is never part of a genuine bbq competition.  The beef ribs were amazingly tender, with just the right amount of beefy, smokey flavor, and exactly the appropriate texture for easy biting and enjoying.  My son and I chose to take advantage of RS's amazing bargain - $35 for any amount of any items on the menu.  What a great way to sample everything.\n\nWe arrived at RS before its 10 am opening, and we were not the first in line.  This place has definitely been discovered, yet it deserves all of the new reviews it receives.  The ribs are perfectly cooked, the brisket is tender, juicy, and has just the right amount of smoke and meat flavor, the sides and desserts are absolutely terrific.  And yes, the corn nuggets are in a class by themselves.  Wow, are they special and addictive.  If that recipe ever gets out, it could be the beginning of world peace.\n\nEven Brenda, behind the counter, was as helpful and nice as could be.  She made us feel right at home, helped us with our choices, explained the system for ordering and receiving the delicious dishes, and generally conveyed an honest, feel-good vibe.  I highly recommend Rollin Smoke for BBQ that should be on anyone's list of the top BBQ restaurants in the country."

I was starving so I decided to order the \"outlaw\" burger while my companion went for a pulled pork \"sandwich\". The sandwich turned out to be a burger with lots of pork, home made sauce and coleslaw. My burger was a gigantic tower with a heavy meat patty, lettuce, tomatoe, pickles and onion rings. It was impossible to eat it without taking it apart. The meat was fantastic and all the ingredients were wisely chosen and harmonized well. It is the best and farmost the cheapest burger I got so far."

Note that this place is in a strip of office buildings in an industrial part of town off the strip. Lots if different BBQ options on the menu - I had the half chicken and green beans and it was really good. I saw some other patrons eating ribs that looked really good. This is not a restaurant but instead you order at the counter and the food is brought out to you at self seating picnic tables. The prices aren't super cheap so you are paying for quality. Overall, was enjoyable although not sure it's a must visit if you visit Vegas."

Alas, Rollin Smoke did not deliver.  \n\nI ordered the 5 meat combo so that I could taste a good sampling.  Food arrived fast but it was clear that most if not all of it had set there in a steam plate for many hours.  Without sauce, all tasted bland and stale.  The sausage link was both dry and others while not try, clearly had that watery taste.  Ribs were decent but just like pulled pork was not edible without the sauce.\n\nI could tell this food could be better if it were fresh but I have to rate what I ate and that was very disappointing.\n\nI had three sides:\n1. ColeSlaw.  I love coleslaw to cool my mouth between bites.  This one seemed fresh and nice but had a strong mexican flavor which ruined the experience.  This is a personal judgement of course.  The beans were both a little too spicy and sweet.  Again, I can see others liking it.  Last was waffle fries.  I liked these very much even though they too were not very fresh.\n\nI also had a couple of rolls and these were excellent.  Nice, soft and fresh!\n\nBack to the sauce, it had a magical ability to make the stale meats tasted decent.  Without it I would have walked out with one bite.  It is rather thin, medium spicy and sweet (this was the \"American Sauce\").\n\nOn the atmosphere, the place had a rather unpleasant smell to it.  While visually clean, it made you think it was not.\n\nAnyway, disappointed after spending $36 for dinner for one."

Quick switch to a sandwich and shared some sides with my friends: hush puppies, corn nuggets, beans & corn bread.  \nThe beans were a strong disappointment, perhaps because that is one of my favorite parts of good old fashioned Kansas City barbecue.  Here the beans were a little too firm for my taste and the sauce was thin and not quite as flavorful as I would have liked.  The hush puppies were decent, the corn bread was moist but more in the style of a cake batter with a very small amount of cornmeal added.  The fried corn nuggets were ok.\nMy sandwich was good and the meat was tender, though as others have commented I added quite a bit of BBQ sauce to it.\nOne aspect I didn't care for was the \"messiness\" in the dining area.  I certainly understand that operating a high volume dining establishment is hard work, especially when the food is messy to eat, but it can be done.  After placing my order and looking for available seating, several of the spots still had used napkins or debris at the tables.  The open spot we chose had plastic utensils on the floor under the seats and the condiment bottles were messy.  I was facing the back station where customers could grab napkins or tea and the white front was covered with scuff marks and such."

For sure. \n\nWe wanted to branch out for a new lunch spot--something that wasn't on the strip or in our hotel. I Yelped \"lunch\" and Rollin Smoke was one of the first places to pop up. So me, my girlfriend and my sister piled into an Uber and set out for some bbq. \n\nThe menu can be a bit overwhelming with all of the different meats and combinations. I wanted to sample a little bit of it all, so I opted for the 5 meat platter: pulled pork; brisket; hot link; chicken; spare ribs. Everything was really good and unlike some other Yelpers, my chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender. I love seeing that tasty smoke ring on the ribs and the meat melted in my mouth. The sauce selection was great and I really like that they allow you to sauce the meat yourself. Nothing worse than bad bbq being covered up by an abundance of sauce. \n\nWith the 5 meat platter you are given a choice of 3 sides...I opted for the baked beans; collards and mac and cheese. All were very good and the bits of pork found in the collards added flavor and were a nice touch. The mac and cheese was gooey and had that homemade feel. \n\nAlso, the service was great. The employees at the counter were helpful and it seemed like every few minutes a staff member would come into the room we were dining in to make sure everybody was enjoying their food. We were fortunate to not have a line when we came here but while dining, the place quickly filled up."

For what has been stated as one of the best BBQ places in the country I honestly have enjoyed certain items at places here in UT even better. \nThat out of the way we were very please with the food and clearly their technique is flawless. The smoke rings were perfect and they did have hands down the best ribs in every way that I have ever had. One thing I did not notice on the board is that if you don't ask for it specifically they default to chopping up their brisket, and though it was quite tasty I would have preferred my brisket to be sliced, and I am surprised (since I've never seen it that way before) that chopped rather than sliced is their default. \nThey also had the best mustard based BBQ sauce I've ever had which they call \"Sweet Country Girl\", and their other sauces are quite tasty too but I typically prefer a thicker Texas style sauce (didn't effect my review, just a note) to their Louisiana/ Alabama style thin vinegar sauces. \nI Ordered a 3 meat plate: Ribs, Pork, Brisket and a side of their potato salad. The portions were good but not generous, and as mentioned above the ribs were awesome, brisket was tasty but would have liked to have tasted it sliced, and the pork was good but not exceptional. Everything did have a very nice smoky flavor and a perfect crust, and I ate almost everything mostly dry, but added dashes here and there on my fork. \nMy wife ordered their big baked potato (cant remember what they call it) which was just huge and loaded with all sorts of goodness and brisket on top. It was very delicious and I think that they smoke rather than bake the potato but I could be wrong. \nThey take your order at the counter then bring it out to you when its ready. The service was okay but nothing great and they weren't particularly friendly at the counter, but they guy who brought out our food was pretty nice. \nI will certainly eat here again, but at this point cant say that it is my overall favorite BBQ place. Their prices are actually pretty good for Vegas, and I think they give a discount to locals (which is a bit annoying)."

            "review": "Here's the rundown regarding Rollin Smoke BBQ;\n\n1.  Huge, I mean gigantic portions.  See pictures for yourself\n2.  No one can compete with their prices when it comes to BBQ.\n3.  Hole in the wall type restaurant, my favorite type \n4.  Great service\n5.  Conveniently located near my favorite type of clubs.  Joking...I think. \n\nWhen I first met Heather H, the first thing that came out of her mouth wasn't \"Hi, nice to meet you\".  It was \"have you been to Rollin Smoke?, You have to go there ASAP\".  Actually, she did say \"hi\", but Rollin Smoke stuck in my head.  If you don't know Heather H, she's a well respected Yelper in the Las Vegas community.  And if Heather and her boyfriend love the food here, then it must be pretty damn good.  Read the reviews, rarely any complaints from anyone about Rollin Smoke. \n\nWhen I found out that we were having dinner at Rollin Smoke one Friday evening, guess who I reached out to?  Heather H of course.  I thought it was funny that while she responded to my questions, she was also on her way to Rollin Smoke for lunch.   She's a die hard for sure.  As for her suggestions, she suggested something she never had and the rest of the menu. I guess this means a Win Win situation for me. \n\nMy Meal:\nChicken and Ribs Combo:  Read this closely.  Don't look at prices because it's deceiving. The portions are huge!!! Portions are so big, that I only was able to finish half my chicken and one rib.  I loved the chicken BBQ. It's cooked perfectly, chicken still tender (not dry), and the flavors poured out of it with every bite. As for the ribs, I only had one and thought it was just okay. I hate to admit that I've had better ribs elsewhere. But for the price, it was a great deal. \n\nTheir mac and cheese is a must eat as well as their corn bread on steroids.  I finished the mac n cheese, but could only muster half my corn bread.  Both had a little kick to it.  Yes, even the corn bread had a kick to it. \n\nService was pretty good too.  You need to order at the counter and the food is served to you.  Like most BBQ places, the food does take a little time to cook so be patient and enjoy your company. \n\nI ate a lot, Terri R ate a lot, and Chad S ate a lot. I guess that equals to all of us eating a lot.  $40 for 3 people to eat on a Friday night is not bad at all.  It's such a bargain here that you'll even be left with a few bills to hit the nearby clubs and make it rain.  \n\nChicken and Ribs Combo (Rib Portion):  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=GGZosl72mVr20EopFH0CCQ#JzVJa44kXIqmrTwzsB0Vog\n\nChicken and Ribs Combo (Chicken Portion w/their Mac N Cheese):  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=GGZosl72mVr20EopFH0CCQ#eBYim1tMqbyjwCSu_KomSA\n\nCorn Bread:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=GGZosl72mVr20EopFH0CCQ#KCz1AngCp_JfBfBADzCf_A"

I thought to myself 6 bucks for a rib? I don't think so.  When my order came the beef rib was definitely the largest item on the plate.  When I tasted the rib I was speechless, this meat was more tender than any pork rib I have ever had.  The flavor was unbelievable.  I devoured the rib and was almost full when I finished it.  I forced myself to sample the other ribs, the dirty rice (which was wonderful by itself) and the corn fritters. Although it was a little strange ordering at the counter the wait staff was available most of the time. The food was great, the beef rib is second to none and I will definitely be coming back."

I'm pretty sure I left 3 lbs heavier than when I walked in. We ordered and loved the pulled pork, brisket, and hot links. The loaded mash potatoes and green beans were great as sides but the yams were too sweet for my taste. I was impressed by the service too. While we were eating a gentleman sitting nearby complained about his bread. The manager (maybe owner?) personally came out to apologize and make things right.

The wall sized menu is easy to follow and offers a whole lot to choose from. This being my first visit, I had to take a while before deciding but everyone does that it seems. The line gets long and for good reason. If you get there after 11:15, expect to standing outside those doors leading in. There's ample seating on a sunny day or dry evening. The weather is perfect for both for now. All tables have unlimited napkins, ketchup and BBQ sauce. The people are very friendly and check in on you every 30 minutes or so to make sure you're enjoying your food. Indoors is splint into two eating areas. One is the room you come into to order with picnic benches set up and various displays all around the room including the giant sized menu. The other has a couple of flat screens going with a game or two on broadcast.\n\nThe food was savory and very tasty! We had a hot dog, the Duo which is a two meat order and a Trio a three meat order consisting of brisket, pork ribs and hot links. Other choices we could have had were a \u00bc chicken and pork. Our sides were waffle fries and mashed potatoes. The hot dog was meaty with good chew and snap when you bit in. The fries rounded out the intake quite nicely, not too oily and plentiful. The hot links are sneaky spicy as they invade your palette bite after bite. So good! The brisket was tender and cut right. I needed extra sauce because that's what I like. The ribs were killer! Lots of meat on those bones, tender but held good form after the bite. Those were sucked dry. The mashed potatoes garnished with fresh bacon bits and melted cheese were thick, rich and flavorful. I could eat that all day! Unlimited drinks and BBQ sauce are always a plus. \n\nWhat's my bottom line? I have a saying about restaurants: You get one shot at the title; if you succeed, you'll get more shots at the championship! So yeah, I'm coming back! There's so much still to try and this initial visit definitely left a strong, positive impression. Great prices, championship quality BBQ. My actual rating is a 4.7 stars..."

We ordered rib tips, the loaded mash potatoes, Mac& cheese along with two half rack ribs. It really hit the spot! But beware, they top everything with chives.

            "review": "Frequently thrown into conversations about the best BBQ in Vegas Rollin Smoke is certainly better than most, but is it actually good BBQ? I tried to write this view avoiding all hints of BBQ snobbery but that is just impossible for me- the snob is too strong. So you may want to take my comments with a grain of salt- for the average American RSB is probably perfectly acceptable BBQ. Having lived in the south and spent a lot of time in Texas and KC it wasn't all that I hoped it would be, but it was still probably the best in Vegas (probably need to due a more detailed head to head vs Road Kill) \n\nIf you are from the south or KC you will prob find RSB to be pretty mediocre. If, however, you are a Las Vegas local who doesn't get to travel to BBQ hotspots frequently then it is a lifeline. Its all a matter of perspective really. There is nothing wrong with RSB, the food is pretty good. It would not, however, stay in business in large scale BBQ cities.\n\nI got the buffet so I could try everything. My favorite BBQ, or really any, food is beef rib so I ordered one of those right off the bat. The beef rib was a little dry, something several people had warned me about in advance, but smothered with sauce it was pretty decent. Not life changing, but definitely good and considering how few places in LV even serve beef rib its probably the go to for that. \n\nPulled Pork- this was better than the beef rib. Not dry, pretty flavorful, went well with the sauce. They showed the pig the respect it deserves\n\nPork rib- def better than the beef rib here. Seemed like it had been smoked for a good amount of time and wasn't way over done to the point where the bones fall apart or anything\n\nBrisket- meh. The brisket I got had very little fat and so very little flavor and was somewhat dry. I like big thick slices of brisket, these were very thin and not very tall, so I'm guessing they weren't cut off a complete brisket. \n\nChicken- this was actually pretty good. I don't normally order chicken at BBQ places because its chicken and pig is usually available but since it was all you can eat I gave it a whirl. Would eat again\n\nMac and Cheese- this seemed like it had some potential but was served pretty cold.  It was in fact Cheezy\n\nBaked Beans- these were great, would eat again and in large quantity. \n\nCorn nuggets- fried corn, hard to go wrong, could eat about 3 lbs of these in one sitting."

It's as much to eat here as it is at a nice sit down restaurant. For a small shack that serves BBQ at picnic tables, it's a bit pricey. It certainly isn't the best BBQ I've ever had.  That being said, good BBQ in Vegas is virtually non-existent, and Rollin Smoke's existence is appreciated.  It's definitely worth a visit to see if it's your style of BBQ."

Location is in a run down shopping center and not a frequently used street for the local but aren't all the good places like that?\nIt was a place you order and grab your seat. They offer an ample amount of picnic bench seating so don't worry about a rush and not having a place to sit. Just think you can make friends with someone new. I got here around noon on a Friday. I just beat the rush. But as I said don't let that steer you away; quick and efficient service. \nI ordered the duo plate; chopped brisket, hot links, mac & cheese and an order of hush puppies. My mouth is watering thinking about this meal again. There was so much flavor in every bit. My favorite was the brisket though. The hot links definitely had some kick to it so be sure to stock up on your sweet tea beverage. Hush puppies are like no others I ever had. They have jalape\u00f1os in them! Oh and I forgot the corn bread. This was like dessert, no butter or honey needed. It was almost like the consistency of a pound cake and never once crumbled. \nThe part that always gets me & deserves that extra star is seeing the chefs come out asking how everything was.  Always puts a smile on my face seeing how much pride they have in their cooking. A must try off the strip restaurant!"

We ordered the BBQ sandwich pack, as illustrated on the website we were suppose to receive 1 pound of brisket, 1 pound of pork, and 1 pound of hot links. As a concierge service at one of the hotels on the strip we have access to a scale. So when we opened the box and it did not look like enough to feed 10-12 people we weighed the box. 1 pound in total for the weight of meat. When we tried to contact them no one answered and when we returned to store front we were greeted by Big Mike who did not care at all. We have frequently recommended customers to this business during NFR or when a guest is craving bbq. These recommendations will stop."

Meat was perfect, beautiful smoke rings, meat was tender and juicy and just had great flavor that appreciated the flavor of the ribs itself (like, didn't overpower-ing-ly just taste like seasoning). The half rack was more than enough for me to eat. The side of green beans I had was simple, but flavorful. My date had the smoked meat loaf over mashed potatoes with Mac n cheese. I tried it and it was delicious! Nice smokey flavor, AWESOME SAUCE, meat was moist and perfectly seasoned, mashed potatoes were creamy and a great compliment to the smokiness, the Mac n cheese was very creamy, thick and super cheesy. He wanted to order the same meal again!\n\nThe ambiance of this place has a small town, hole in the wall kind of feel. It's kind of in an odd location, a true gem not too far off the strip.

The sandwiches and sliders aren't dressed up, those sweet buns capture every drop of moisture (and believe me, you won't want to waste it). They also come dressed with simplicity; signature sauce and pickles, of course, the star attraction is the meat, and it is epic. Id also recommend trying those cross crossed fries - absolutely loaded with flavour, and the perfect thing to scoop up any escaped meat!"

I had company in from out of town and we are a bunch of gluttons, so all you can eat bbq sounded great. We checked the website to make sure they still had it. They did, and the website said $24.95 per person. We walked in, and there was a piece of paper over the price on the menu board that said $34.95. I told the girl that was ringing us up that her website said $24.95, and I didn't think it was right to do the bait and switch, we had driven two cars 20 miles to get there. She said \"you could access the website?\"! I pulled it up on my phone and showed her. She went to talk to someone in the back, then returned and said, sorry, that's the price. I said, \"so you're not going to honor your advertised price?\". She said, \"do you want to talk to somebody else?\". I said only if it might make a difference. She went and got the owner. He told me \"sorry, I had to raise the price or I'd be out of business, that's been our price for three months\". I of course said, \"you've had three months to update your website and you're not willing to honor your advertised price?\". He said sorry. I really wanted to eat there, it smelled great. I can not however patronize a place that will not honor their advertised price, especially if it's been wrong for three months on their website. I can't imagine how that can't be intentional. I will not ever walk back into that place."

We pretty much had a little of everything and can't say anything bad at all!! Great service too.  The venue is a little bit small but the food is worth it!"

As you may already know about me, I am a first-rate barbecue snob ...the kind of guy who is first to correct anybody who confuses grilling with barbecuing.  That is not a concern here.  We're talking about brisket and pork that is smoked for 18 hours -- baby back, pork *and* beef ribs -- wickedly good sides (like jalapeno coleslaw and corn nuggets) -- even some unique sandwiches.  It's in an odd part of town, off of Highland and under the Desert Inn overpass (yes, surrounded by strip clubs & warehouses) but somehow the location just seems to work.  \nMake no mistake:  this is the absolute best barbecue that you will find in Las Vegas.  Period.  \nIf you like legit barbecue then you need to judge this place for yourself.   \nYou're welcome."

Meat was tasty, flavorful and juicy (not overly greasy, just juicy).\n\nThe Chicken was cooked perfectly and unusually soft (in a good way), same with the beef. \n\nThe cornbread is excellent...tastes like it has a lot of butter, which is pretty damn good IMHO~\n\nThe seating sucks though; I had to have ma boy buy my grub while I went and sat in an open booth. There was a huge crowd of folks waiting to order (you order first, pay then go sit.  They bring you your food).  I kinda got some disappointed looks from the crowd as I apparently was the only one smart/clever enough to go grab seats while your buddies are ordering for you?! haha\n\nSide Note 1 - Don't ask the staff if they have any to-go containers...they will look at you like a total dumbass as containers are plainly visible at the counter, next to the soda and utensils hahaha (the dude just rolled his eyes and pointed, I in turn looked a damn fool~ hahahaha)\n\nSide Note 2 - This is on a side street that has about 4-5 strip clubs. The street itself is dark and looks like the kind of area you could get mugged, raped, etc.  So go with a nice sized group of people if you're gonna go at night, and bring tazers or mace~\n\n---Overall---\n\nService: A.  We got our food pretty quick~\n\nFood: A. Great food if you're looking for a heavy meat fix!!!\n\nAtmosphere: C.  If I wasn't worried about getting ass-raped, I would probably visit more often."

The smoke ring on the brisket looks like perfection and tastes like a gift from above. Sampled sides were a delicious mac & cheese (with two home made pickles hiding under the styrofoam bowl) and these fried creamed corn poppers that cannot be properly described in text - they are a delightful experience. The home-made house sauce is bold and flavorful and more than enough for most meals, but there are two more home-made sauces as well - a sweet sauce that compliments the pork very well, and a \"damn hot\" sauce that is very tasty and has a sneaky heat that gets you after the second mouthful. Great meats, excellent sides, great sauces and a friendly staff make this place a must-visit on your next trip to Sin City."

We did, but apparently filming started at 11 instead of the posted time of noon (oh well). We met up with Roger, as well as invited one other friend. \n\nLocation, actually not as hard to find as i had thought. Though i had \"scouted\" the place a few days prior, still wasn't hard as some may have said. Coming from Fashion Show or Mel Tourne, taking a right onto industrial, then left at the light, then right again, and you are pretty much there ! \n\nRestaurant is a little small but lots of seating. Parking wise, decent amount. Unless there was some specific thing going, should be parking avail. \n\nUpon entry, first thing you see is their huge menu on the wall. Since Doriee was on break and didn't want to eat too much, we decided to share. And being \"marketed\" the beef rib so much by Roger (steak on a stick is what he calls it), we opted to get the Rib Platter Special. Comes with one side and a drink. For the side, we got the corn nuggets ! Or rather Doriee \"excitedly\" shouted corn nuggets XD ! Since she was on her lunch break (1 hour time, but work was close by), we hoped it wouldn't take long. Upon ordering, we were told about 25 minutes. \n\nRib Platter Special - $17.99 - 3 Baby Back Ribs, 2 Spare Ribs, and 1 Beef Rib - Ordered with a side of Corn Nuggets. \n\nTo our surprise, it came in about 20 minutes or less. Good on timing !! :D\n\nPretty big platter. Was definitely a good sharing size between the two of us. Corn nuggets were piled on the side. To our surprise (again), the corn nuggets were pretty good. Corn gave it a nice sweetness and it was nice and crispy ! The sauce it comes with is like a mix between thousand island and like the sauce from Raising Canes. Sweet, little tangy. \n\nNow the main entree. Ribs. The so-called \"steak on a stick\" was a beef rib that had a lot of meat on it, as well as a pretty thick layer of fat. The meat was not how i imagined it to be. Yes, as the restaurant name suggests, smokey, definitely a lot of smokey flavor (lasted the rest of the day lol!) but the meat broke off like it was stewed meat? I'm not sure if its because beef ribs weren't one of my favorite type of rib or its been too long since i had a beef rib but it was quite disappointing. Flavor was decent but meat texture wise, a little different. Both the baby back ribs and spare ribs were, yet again, smokey, but to our disappointment again, it was quite dry. Would have preferred it to be a little more seasoned/marinated to give it a nice flavor instead the meat but the dryness of the meat kind of made it saddening. Tried to help it with the bbq sauce on the table, but didn't really help. \n\nThe BBQ sauce was a very thin sauce, so if you were to put in on anything, it almost rolls right off. Flavor wise, sweet, tangy, spicy. Not bad but not my favorite either. \n\nThe following two items were ordered by Roger and another friend but im just putting what i SEE :P \n\nThe Outlaw Burger - $8.99 - Brisket, Onion, Bell Pepper, Onion Strings, Red Cabbage Slaw, Lettuce, Tomato, Cheddar Cheese, and Chipotle Aioli\n\nHUGE burger. The burger is, i believed a confirmed 1lb patty with tons of stuff stacked on top. Roger tried to press it down to make it smaller to eat, but to no avail. That burger was DENSE ! Not too much of a burger person but looked pretty good ! Maybe could try, if it was split with someone half n half.. \n\nBrisket Dog - $8.99 - 1/4 Lb Beef Hot Dog, Brisket, Smothered in Cheese and Onion Strings\n\nI didn't even notice the hot dog in it until after my friend bit into it. Similar to the burger, ingredient filled/stacked. I was actually surprised my friend ate it fairly cleanly without everything falling out and onto the plate. \n\nDesserts !!!\n\nSouthern Peach Cobbler & Country Black Berry Cobber - sweet and flavorful. sauce was very thin and runny. kind of hard to eat (especially if you were sharing. would prefer the sauce to be a little thicker. still pretty good ! \n\nMama's Banana Pudding - imagine a bread pudding but instead of bread, its vanilla wafers... with slices of banana and pudding. Yummy dessert :P \n\nReese's PB Cup Bread Pudding - soaking in a RUM sauce, the dense but flavorful bread pudding is like hell on a plate. bread pudding usually is already pretty flavorful from it absorbing the heavy cream but in this case, it is a PEANUT BUTTER CUP bread pudding... rich peanut butter taste with a nice rum sauce glaze on top. Prob my fav on the 4 desserts listed. \n\nOverall. good place. though the ribs were a bit disappointing. Everything else was pretty good. Would like to try other things, like their brisket and such"

Not a far drive from the strip, we were impressed by the many 4+ star reviews. Like many small bbq restaurants in the South and Midwest, they offered all the regular meats: brisket, sausage or hot links, BBQ Chicken, ribs, and pulled pork.  They offered a good selection of sides as well, and I ordered the 3 meat combo (brisket with 2 orders of pork ribs) with loaded mash as my sides.  \n\nThe food was decent, but not great unfortunately. The pork was definitely fall of the bone tender, and the brisket was very dry and didn't have a great taste to it. They did offer a good selection of sauces to go along with the meat, but it didn't really help and I was really looking forward to some good bbq.  The problem may have been that it was 11:30pm and the food was being kept warm from earlier in the evening, but I'm still judging it based on what it was served. Maybe I'll come back during the day when the food was freshly cooked and it will be better."

I just know that I will be coming around more often. If I could, I would have eaten more. My eyes were hoping for dessert, but my stomach said no way.\n\nI got the rib plater and it was amazing. It comes with a monster of a beef rib, three baby backs, and two spareribs. For $17.99, you get a side and a drink with it. I got the kickin' beans and added the jalapeno coleslaw for $2 more. BBQ beans are often too sweet for me. Here, too. The coleslaw though is delicious. The perfect balance of creamy and spicy. The baby backs were my least favorite of the bunch. Mine were somewhat dry. I needed to smother them in their housemade BBQ sauce. Usually beef ribs can be tough, but I pulled the whole thing off the bone and inhaled. It was huge and contained so much meat. \n\nThey have a $34.99 AYCE option for anything on the menu, but I felt like I was about to die after half of my plate."

The pulled pork is on point but last night it was served cold. I guess maybe that's just the way they have it, I don't know, but still very delicious. Now the only reason I deducted a star is because I absolutely LOVE ribs, last time I came I got the St. Louis spare ribs which were dry and disappointing, and this time I got the \"world famous\" beef ribs which were also dry but very fatty and just not good. Not only that it was $18.99 for a half slab which is only 2 pieces, kinda pricey IMO. But they do give locals discounts which makes up for it. Next time I go I'm going to try to baby backs, but if those don't impress then I'm going to be really sad because everyone says amazing things about the ribs!"

I even feel badly about the low rating that I am leaving, because so many others were so good.  But this is our truth...\n\nWe walked into the place and the smell of smoke was potent and we were really eager to try a little of everything.  We ordered a sampler and because we \"checked in\" there we got a free dessert.  The meal was a HUGE disappointment!  What a shame.  We have strong roots in the south and this did not do it any justice.  \n\nThe chicken was flavorless.  The ribs had smokey flavor, but was borderline jerky!  The pulled pork was sub-par.  The sides were also a disaster.  The beans were hard and way too spicy, just underdeveloped flavor.  The mac and cheese was a mushy blob of fake-tasting cheese, just not good!  The bread they served was hard and cold.  I would have paid them extra NOT to bring the so called dessert to the table.  That was the poorest excuse for peach cobbler.  Marie Calender's from the local grocery store would have been way better.  The banana pudding was baby food grade, and gritty, just not right!  \n\nMaybe we went at the wrong time of day (dinner time on a Tuesday night)?  Perhaps it would have been better at lunch time or on a Friday/Saturday night?  Maybe, if we're desperate, we might try again on a more popular night?  \n\nI think the guys are trying hard, because the service was pretty good and hospitable (hence the 1 star).  For us, the service was the only bright spot.  We left a lot of the food picked over and with our pockets $30 lighter.  The waiter came over to the table with a big smile and said \"Ain't it good?\"  We just didn't have the heart to break it down for him.  It is terrible when you pay for food and it doesn't meet your expectations and you leave hungry...what a waste of time and money :-("

You can sit at the picnic tables by the counter, or cross over into the dining room that houses additional tables and a couple TVs.  Tables are equipped with a roll of paper towels and their signature BBQ sauce, which is a little sweeter than traditional Texas sauce, but good.\n\nThis trip we got combo plates of Sliced Brisket with Fried Okra and Pulled Pork with Kicken Beans and Jalapeno Coleslaw.

A few simple booths and a small dining room, walk up ordering, not fancy in the least but great BBQ. We had the sample platter for 4 plus a rack of St. Louis Ribs, sides of hushpuppies fried okra and greens. The okra was our favorite. The ribs were great, as was the pulled pork. The chicken was good but not outstanding. Give it a try for a totally off the strip authentic experience."

They accidentally brought us an extra plate of brisket instead of the fries. As soon as we said something the fries were next on the line. The kitchen manager came right out apologized , gave us the brisket and brought out the fries within seconds, he was very friendly.   I thought that was great service. Being born and raised in Las Vegas I have a much higher expectation of service than most others. Anyway the kitchen manager came back out one more time. Offered us free desert , he said \" even if you say no I'm bringing it out.\"  So we asked for the berry cobbler. He returned with his home made banana pudding along with an order of cobbler. The banana pudding was absolutely amazing ! The cobbler was a wine based and was excellent ! Overall the service and the food was wonderful. My father is still raving about his meatloaf and my mother says her chicken was great. I would recommend this place to anyone !"

Due to the popularity with the locals, the establishment is under strain to keep up.\n\nFood: 10/10 - This is where this establishment shines.  True barbeque.  The brisket and ribs have smoke rings in the meat and the building smells great when you walk in.   Great value!   You get a lot of food for not a lot of money.    Served on white bread just like BBQ should be!  \n\nService: 7/10 - The kitchen really cares about what they are serving.  However the ordering process is under strain to keep up with the largely local patrons who visit.  The line frequently stretches out the door and with one person taking orders the wait can be longer than it takes to eat the food.    The person taking the  orders is friendly and trying hard to keep up but the management needs to improve the infrastructure.  The podium itself is very simplistic and the whole setup is not build to handle a crowd.\n\nDecor: 5/10 - They have a fish tank featured on the tv show \"Tanked\" but it is in sad shape.  The restaurant is worn out and a bit unorganized comprising of 3 disjointed eating areas.   The eating areas look like they were expanded to meet demand but in an adhoc manner.\n\nCleanliness: 7/10 -  The area to get your sodas is sub par.  Poor lighting and hidden for first time visitors.   There were no major areas of uncleanliness but the restaurant was not beaming with cleanliness either.   Some improvement is needed.\n\nParking: 6/10 - Parking can be tight.  Small shared lot.   Note: You are in strip club central in this area.\n\nRestrooms: N/A - Didn't visit.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10 - Don't bother with BBQ on the strip.  This is a local gem if you can go at off peak times or don't mind waiting for your food.  \n\nThe food is what brings the locals here and for good reason.   The problems that this establishment faces are good problems to have.  Namely, they are growing fast and are in a phase where they should be planning their next phase of development.  They are in need of a re-haul on the building itself to bring the eating area into one cohesive place with a modern order taking setup.\n\nIf they can overcome these obstacles there's no end in sight to the good things that lie ahead at Rollin' Smoke BBQ."

I was in Vegas on a business trip and tried it on a lark... Where have you been all my life, Rollin Smoke Barbeque?!\n\nAs soon as I walked in, I could smell it... That authentic smoke that portents rich, savory flavor in meat (if it is done correctly, and Dusty - the proprietor of this gem - does it correctly).\n\nTheir prices were definitely solid for definitely solid for the portion size, which is a pretty remarkable thing in Vegas.  There is even a 10% off coupon on their website!  I got the all-you-can-eat deal (which is all you can eat of anything on their menu... anything!) because I wanted to try a bit of many different things, and it was $21.50 after coupon.  But their other meals and combos were very reasonably priced as well.\n\nNow for the feast... I tried sausage, brisket, hot wings, spare ribs, and beef ribs, but they also had shrimp, catfish, baby back ribs, chicken, hush puppies, beans, and on and on and on.  The sausage was solid with a nice little kick.  The brisket was a little lean, but very tender and tasty.  I got the \"Damn Hot\" hot wings (I have won several wing challenges in my day), and I don't know if they were trying harder to hurt me than normal, but they were HOT, with a building heat that walked that line between pleasure and pain.  All of that was great, but the ribs really shined.  The spare ribs were large and meaty, with a deep-down smoke flavor that spoke volumes about the slow care that went into their creation.  And the beef ribs, which Dusty insisted I try, were the coup de gras... Meaty, mild, flavorful, and tender... The best beef ribs I have ever had, no contest!  And how did I finish this homage to gluttony?  With a homemade bread pudding (covered in whiskey sauce) that was heavenly!!\n\nDusty himself chatted with me and my friends for a bit - telling us about his cooking process, the pride he (as Pit Master) takes in his food, and the labor of love his restaurant has become - and we even got to meet the special chef whose grandmother's bread pudding recipe would now forever haunt my dreams.\n\nThis is THE hidden gem of Las Vegas...  I have lived all throughout the South (Texas, Georgia, Virginia, and everywhere in between), and this is the BEST BARBEQUE I HAVE EVER HAD!!  If you like barbeque, and you are coming to Las Vegas, I highly recommend you give this place a shot.\n\nNote to Guy Fieri: this place needs to be on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, immediately!"

The smoke does 98% of the flavoring and the BBQ sauce is the final enhancement.   The mac n' cheese is creamy and rich.  The guys that work there are really friendly and helpfull.

We were a little skeptical at first but since the reviews were great, we decided to go inside and try it out.\n\nThe place is not that big but it is full of people.  It smells great inside... something you would expect in a bbq joint.  You pick a table then go to the guy where you can place your order and pay.  They will then bring you your food.  Drinks and utensils are self served.  \n\nThe menu is filled with great selection of yummy food. We ordered the following (our eyes were bigger than our stomach for sure):\n\n1) The Pit Special (4 choices of meat + 3 sides) -  We picked the brisket, pulled pork, double on the spare ribs, corn nuggets, bacon potato salad & mac & cheese.  The brisket was disappointing coz it was dry. The pulled pork has great flavor. The ribs is perfect! I love love the ribs... glad we doubled up on this.  The corn nuggets and bacon potato salad are amazing!  The mac & cheese is ok, had better.\n\n2) Meatloaf + corn bread for his side - my son loved this one. The meat taste great but the onion rings are overpowering for me (not a big fan of onions). Now the corn bread is to die for!  It's moist and totally delish... one of the best that I've had. \n\n3) Chicken Wings (Buffalo) + Waffle Fries - my husband loved the hot sauce but he said the wings was alright (he had the hot sauce on the side). The waffle fries was not bad but it wasn't great either.\n\n4) Banana Pudding - this was disappointing for me. It taste like it came out of a package. \n\nOverall, this place is definitely a keeper for us.  We are all looking forward on coming back to try the other food on their menu.  The price is not bad, food is great, ambiance is casual & food servings are good size."

Not as good as Texan bbq, but this is just as close to the Lone Star state it'll get! WAYYYYYYYYY better than Famous Dave's. Oh boy, do I hate Famous Daves -- such an insult to BBQ.\n\nAtmosphere -- super laid back, picnic table, and family style. Very casual dining. \n\nBoyfriend and I shared a 4 meat platter, we had: RIBS, BRISKET, CHICKEN, and PULLED PORK. We went a bit crazy with the sides because we wanted to try everything -- loaded mashed potatoes, hush puppies, mac and cheese, cole slaw, onion rings, and waffle fries.\n\nEverything was so good! My favorite was the pulled pork, it was seasoned really well and so tender. Close second -- the bbq chicken. SUPER JUICY! The brisket was melt in your mouth, a bit over seasoned for me. Ribs were okay, not the best I've had ever, but were good. \n\nAll sides taste home made. My favorite were the hush puppies, mac and cheese (SO CREAMY), and loaded mashed potatoes. \n\nI kept seeing people order the Outlaw burger. ONLY SMOKES! It's humungus! Definitely trying that next time I come back! \n\nAll in all -- bf and I are super excited to have a bbq joint we love and can bring family/friends to! We will definitely be coming around whenever we are near the strip. Definitely a must try if you are in the area!"

I ordered the combo plate (ribs and brisket) with a side of coleslaw and mac n cheese. \n\nThe ribs were perfectly seasoned, and the meat just fell off the bones. It was barky, tasty, and smoky. I loved that the ribs were garnished with spring onions on top. \n\nThe brisket was just as amazing as the ribs. It was moist and had lots of flavor to it . Their seasoning had some secret spices in it, it was not your typical Texas seasoning. I liked the fact that they only put a tiny bit of sauce on their brisket. They didn't drown their meat with sauce. The meat was flavorful to a point that I decided to scratch the sauce off the meat. The brisket also had a great bark. You know what: it was barky, tasty and smoky.\n\nSadly, the sides were not on par with the meats. The coleslaw was bland, and the mac n cheese was too runny. It didn't taste fresh to me. I usually don't care about the sides as much as I care about the meat. I will be back next time that I am in Vegas."

Just so you can understand the level that Rollin Smoke is on they were awarded for top 20 best bbq restaurants in america from localeats AND best burger in vegas seven. Yeah...they're pretty epic.\n\nIt's pretty easy to miss this place, they're near the cross streets highland and desert inn, inside a signless plaza. Just look for a grill outside and you'll be fine. The vibe of the place is very relaxed mixed with decorations of tshirts, a pig, awards, and a mural. A big plus in my book is the amount of seating they have, from the times I went I never had to fight for a table. \n\nCustomer service? Always on point. They strive for it. Anything wrong with what you're eating? They'll fix it. They always have a guy walking around asking people if they're doing fine. \n\nIf you're coming here for the first time you should definitely try the rib tips, and outlaw burger. It takes a while for the outlaw burger to cook, nonetheless it's worth the wait. Let me start off with the rib tips. You can order 1/2 pound or a pound, if you're eating with a group of people, just share a pound it'll be more than enough. Their rib tips are mouthwatering!!! Cooked to perfection. And when you get those fatty pieces in your mouth you can taste the definition of a good bbq. The outlaw burger is just as satisfying. Let me just list the ingredients in the burger it has; brisket, onions, bell pepper, onion strings, red cabbage, slaw, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese, and chipotle ailoi. Yeah, all that in a burger. You know that one question? What do you want to eat before you die? This might be the answer.\n\nTip: There's no shame in getting your hands dirty and pigging out. Dam son just eat that bbq! And you can order to-go over the phone!"

The parking lot and surrounding area may look a bit sketchy, but the restaurant itself isn't!  The staff was friendly and we got our food about 10 mins in, not bad! \n\nI got the duo choice of meat with sliced briskets and two spare ribs. The meat was tender, full of flavor, and cooked perfectly. I like sauce on my barbecue and their Arkansas sauce did not disappoint. The sweet bbq sauce was  also great although their spicy sauce was a bit underwhelming. Portions are great and filling, you get your money's worth here. \n\nThe sides were just as outstanding. I got a side of mac and cheese and corn nuggets. Best mac and cheese I've had! Not many restaurants meet my expectations for good mac and cheese, but theirs were all the right amounts of cheesy flavor and taste. The corn nuggets were also amazing and rightfully hyped. They were a great combination of crispy on the outside and sweet inside with bits of corn.\n\nIf you're a fan of barbecue, you must make a stop here on your next Vegas trip, I certainly will!"

The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars because the set up is a bit confusing. 2 entrance doors one to the dinning area and the other to the main entrance with a few tables, does not have any signage IE seat your self, order here...  So at first we sat down and waited 10 minutes and we realized that we had to order up front.  The menu is massive with all these delectable choices and sides and the smell inside makes you even hungrier.  The writing on the board on the wall is a bit small and intimidating since there are so many things to choose from.  When you get to the counter they only have one menu for you to look at so it holds up the line when you are trying to order.  I chose the mixed platter and the girl at the counter choose my meats and I had potato salad and mac n cheese as my sides, friend ordered all you can eat.  Food took a little bit longer than I would have wanted to but it was 4th of July weekend so it is totally understandable.  When our food arrived it was hot, and it looked amazing.  The food tasted even better than it looked if that is even possible.  I had baby, short and beef ribs and my friend had one of everything on the all you can eAt.  The ribs were perfectly cooked nice bite to it but still fell off the bone.  The bbq sauce on the table was refilled while we were still eating and it was warm and complimented the ribs perfectly.  These guys definitely know what they are doing and they have the recipe for success.  \n\nJust a suggestion for first timers (I will be coming back and I will have your system down) \nPlace a hostess podium with menus, make signage saying pick up menu, wait in line, place order and find a seat.  By having menus available people will stand in line less time and it will be easier for the order takers to expedite service.  Other than that I have absolutely nothing negative to say.\n\nThank you for all the delicious food you are serving us."

This place is the real deal! The inside is not that fancy, but who cares right as long as the food is legit. I would pride myslef as a BBQ snob and this joint hit all the marks. I walked up ordered the 3 meat combo with pulled pork, tri tip and ribs. Couldn't decide on the sides so just ordered some extras like okra, cole slaw, waffle fries and potato salad and boy was that a mistake afterwards. I needed to be wheeled out! This has to be one of the best BBQ joints I have been to outside the rib cook off in Reno and this place has every right to stand off to any National Rib Champion. What sealed the deal for me was the owner and his customer service. This guy was hustling all over the restaurant checking on tables making sure everyone had what they needed. They missed a side off our order and I offered to pay for it and he refused. At another table someone asked how good something was on the menu he brought them out a sample! This doesn't happen in most places today or the level of customer service. \nThen to top it off we meet this nice family while we are eating and they talk us into sampling their banana pudding desert. At first I was like no way I to full then my daughters almost refused to leave before trying so I gave in. This thing put me over the edge but wow was it good! similar to ice cream pudding only fills the cracks when your full...well worth trying or taking some home. This is a must when your in Vegas!"

I had to try a bit of everything so I got the basket with chicken, ribs, hot links and brisket with sides of onion strings, Mac n cheese and bacon potato salad. And for dessert, carmel cake! Hands down delicious! Haven't tried anything in comparison within Vegas."

You will definitely need your GPS to find this place but it is well worth the search. I sense most folks get their orders to go here although they have a decent sized dining area. pretty spartan no frills establishment. my wife enjoyed her catfish po boy...with hush puppies and cole slaw. my son and I each had the meat sampler.....spare ribs,brisket and chicken got our highest grades. Help aren't really friendly but they get your food out without much of a wait. prices are extremely reasonable and as I said..,.the food is very good. close your eyes and you'll swear you are in KC or Memphis."

Our Las Vegas crew raved about it though.  Finally, when I made it out to Vegas for the millionth time we decided to swing by for some finger lickin' BBQ.  It's located quite a ways off the strip, just down the street from Spearmint Rhino, in an industrial looking area.  It's a pretty small place, but it's got some BIG flavors.   I got the 3 meat plate, since I felt like I had to stuff my face the first time to make sure I tried all the good stuff.  I picked the brisket (which is chopped unless you ask otherwise), chicken, and ribs.  For my side, I had the macaroni and cheese.  The boyfriend had the Big Hawg (pulled pork sandwich).  We didn't realize that they'd put an entire pig's worth of pulled pork in that sandwich, but we're not complaining.  The pulled pork was very tender and juicy, and the sandwich was stuffed with a whole pig, coleslaw and some delicious bbq sauce.  My 3 meats were pretty good as well, the chopped brisket had nice crispy pieces and nice juicy/tender pieces.  It was a good balance.  The chicken wasn't anything stellar, but it was good.  I really enjoyed the ribs though.  I'm not a huge rib eater because I don't really like to get my hands dirty, but these ribs fell right off the bone.  I'm totally down with that.  I'd skip the mac and cheese and go for the dirty rice (if you're brave enough) next time.  I had a few bites of my friends' rice, and I fell in love and then became insanely jealous.  \n\nThe staff here is super friendly and attentive.  They'd come out and check on you every now and then to make sure that you have everything you need.  The place is clean, but seating is limited.  We got there at just about 11AM, and it was empty, but moments later it filled up quick.  They also have several different BBQ sauces out for you to try as well.  I liked the spicy one, it went well with the brisket.  I may have to add Rollin' Smoke to my list of places that I must visit when I come to Vegas.  That list is getting long, and it's getting difficult to get through the list each time.  Damn you Vegas for having such good food!"

I've visited rolling smoke a total of three times, and every time I try something different that was just as good, if not better than the last item.\n\nFirst a warning, as soon as you walk into this place, you will experience an instant uncontrollable flow of saliva. The smell is just AMAZING! Now that you've been warned, lets begin with the menu. My absolute favorite is the rib plate and the brisket. The ribs are tender, full of flavor and just come off the bone with ease. The brisket is equally as delicious, with a good variety of BBQ sauces to complement the already great smoked flavor. \n\nA few tips:\nThe place to me seems a little hidden, so GPS it for easy directions. You WILL come out smelling like smoke. The staff is helpful, so if you are unsure of what to get, just ask for their recommendations. \n\nBon appetit!"

I was told about Rollin' Smoke Barbeque about a week ago and I have been wanting to try it since.  I can check that off the list now.  I went with a co-worker, the very same man who told me about it in the first place.  Immediately upon my exit of the car in the tiny parking lot I noticed the smell of BBQ smoke.  It was only enhanced as I entered the establishment.  Aside from the delicious smell of BBQ, which has permeated every fiber of my clothing and still lingers, I was greeted by a huge version of their menu posted to the wall.  I opted for the smaller hand held version though.  It was easier to read.  After looking at said menu for a few minutes I decided on the brisket dog.  I also ordered a side of corn nuggets based on reccomendations from my dining acquaitance of the day.  The hot dog was immense to the point where I gave up eating it with my hands and went with the fork and knife method.  It was a heavy gauge dog with a fantastic red color and the nice snap of a natural casing.  But it was difficult to actually see that beneath the truck load of fried onions, chopped brisket and nacho cheese.  What a gut buster this behemoth is.  Then there are the corn nuggets.  Little bite sized fried pieces of corny goodness.  It is best described as fried creamed corn.  It is crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside with the sweetness I have grown to love.  Frying it just adds to the alure.  After eating the dog and these corn nuggets along with drinking a cup of lemonade, I am stuffed."

Upon reaching the premises my nose was hit with the mouth watering smell of bbq.\nOur party of 18 or so people were given a spot at an empty room and were greeted with great enthusiasm and hospitality. My gf and I were probably the 4th to put in the order of the Outlaw burger and the Rib Plater special. After waiting in the room slowly everyone started to get their food and were enjoying the dinner while we waited. After coming in to check on us (forgot the gentlemen's name) he explained the food was forgotten or being remade, which I can't remember, but long story short they got us the food and also gave us a free A LA MODE Black berry cobbler.\n\nRating of the burger and ribs\n\n-Jaw dropping sized burger filled with such tasty bbq flavor that's complimented with the onion strings (DROOOL)\n-Very flavorful sauce (More on the tangy side) on the ribs and the meat slides right off\n-The cobbler is something that needs to be ordered either by you or someone in your party. I was so full after the burger and a few ribs but was able to have a bite off the cobbler and it was amazing. Full of flavor and just takes over all that meat/bbq flavor in your mouth."

The cashier told us about something (I can't remember the name but it's 5 meats and 3 sides) which sounded perfect for two people! We got the meats and it was like 3 ribs, pulled pork, chopped up brisket, chicken, and sausage. The sausage was perfect. It was spicy, but not too much to where you can't taste it. The flavor in that was amazing! The pulled pork was so damn tender and fell apart perfectly. Brisket is normally dry when I go to other places and it's always chopped into big awkward pieces but I love how small these were cut because it savored alllll the juices. Now what's better than juicy brisket?! And finally the chicken was the least dry chicken I've ever had! \n\n\n\n\nNow for the sides....\n\nThe Mac n cheese, my only complaint was that I wish the cheese on top was melted but other than that it was delicious. It was so creamy and amazing. We also got the mashed potatoes. It had bacon so it was automatically amazing so there's that. And the corn nuggets were so good for something so simple. \n\n\nTo top it off, as we were leaving the owners mom was talking to me and she's so sweet and amazing. She's so proud of her son and does anything to help him. I felt the love through the food as well. I can't wait to be back. I found my favorite bbq place in Vegas!"

I have heard nothing but great things about this place. After checking Yelp, I noticed their 4.5 star overall rating with about 500 reviews. OH-EM-GEE, how have NOT been to this place yet?!?!\n\nIt's not surprise, this place is in the middle of an industrial area, right under the freeway and next to all the strip clubs. Sketchy as heck, but holy smoker in their parking lot! The aroma of smoked meats filled the air. I didn't care what the outside looked like, I was more interested in what they had to offer! The inside of the joint is a down home BBQ joint! Different reds and yellows adorn the wall, different rooms to accommodate different types of parties. They have a few rooms and even outside space. There were metal table tops, wooden benches, TVs in each room and a mirage on the back wall of the room we chose to dine in.On every table there was a bottle of their homemade BBQ sauce. It was more of a vinegar base, a little too tangy but that's just my own taste. The staff was super efficient. The guy who took my order, I think was one of the owners. He was super personable and really seemed to care about how things were going, how I liked my food and really thanked me for coming in. For my meal, I wanted to try a few things. Here's what I got:\n\nHalf slab of beef ribs, 2 bones, for $15.99. This Smokin Plate came with a side, I chose collard greens, corned bread or roll and a drink. The beef ribs were the best beef ribs I've ever had! It literally just fell off the bone, no joke. The rub they used brought so much flavor to the rib! Every bite was juicy, flavorful and packed with smokey goodness. The collard greens were cooked with brisket, had a little spice and vinegar and so good!\n\nPulled piggy sandwich for $7.99. **There's a Yelp special when you check in** Every sandwich purchase comes with a free dessert. I chose the peach cobbler (usually for $3.99). The pulled pork sandwich was made with chopped pork, not finely shredded. I loved that because the meat had some depth to it. It was served on a hot dog bun which was different but seemed to work! The corn bread side was buttery and moist, probably the best corn bread I've ever had! I made a comment that my grandma's corn bread was unbelievable but this one gave my grandma's bread a run for it's money (Sorry grandma!).  As my free dessert, the peach cobbler was gooey and filled with chunks of peaches. \n\nI must say, this is THE BEST BBQ joint in Las Vegas, hands down. I've had a few BBQ joints here before but nothing compares to Rollin Smoke. This place really does a great job at serving great food. When I'm here, it's just good ole country fun. Looking around the dining area, every party seemed to have a huge smile on their face. I've been to lots of places down south, from Nashville, to Louisville, to Charlotte. BBQ joints different where every go but when you're in Las Vegas, you REALLY need to get your butts down here. You will NOT be disappointed!"

I got the double meat plate with 2 orders of ribs (4 ribs total) and bacon potato salad for the side. So delicious! The meat was so tender and full of flavor. It had a beautiful smoke ring on it and the house sauce was a perfect compliment to the rich, smokey meat. \n\nThe reason I gave 3 stars is because of the cashier. He could not crack a smile if his life depended on it. After the person in front of me was done ordering, I gave him a second to finish up until he called us and was ready to take our order. When he did, he acted like we were the stupid ones for not immediately coming up and bombarding him with our order. It was pure attitude from there. He has zero people skills or manners. No, \"thank you,\" \"you're welcome,\" or \"enjoy,\" from him during the transaction. I don't need someone bursting with energy but at least have basic manners."

Right away, Dusty suggests the Smoked Meatloaf which has become one of their regular items on their updated and expanded menu of deliciousness. We also got the Seafood Platter with Fried Catfish, Fried Shrimp, Hush Puppies and Fried Okra which they were out of, so one of the cooks suggested the Corn Fritters, and those did not disappoint! Seasoned well and the sweet creaminess of the corn was very tasty!\n\nThis huge slab of meaty goodness arrives on top a bed of loaded mashed potatoes, and sweet crispy onions with a sweet BBQ sauce and is one of  the tastiest renditions of an American classic that I've come across! The seafood platter is served with lemon, hot sauce, and tartar sauce was equally delicious. The Shrimp had a crisp outside while still keeping that plump, juicy interior, The Catfish was nice, crisp and flaky, and I'm no hush puppy expert but I thought those were just okay.\n\nIf you're still in search of some killer barbecue, you may want to bookmark Rollin' Smoke, it may just become one of your  favorite spots!

Yes, the area & location can be a little sketchy to those unfamiliar especially at night...but don't let that stop you from coming in.  Featured on TV...the marketing campaign and Yelp reviews can speak for it self. With more than that....The wifey and I thought we would pay homage and taste what all the hype was about...considering it too was recommended by friends and co-workers. We went on a Thursday night, about an hour before closing and service was pretty quick with a good amount of customers dining in and carry out. Fairly a small southern hospitality type of place, it caters to a back yard southern type of feeling.  We chose to try the 5 meat platter to taste the different flavors. Ribs, pulled pork, sausage, brisket, & chicken. Came also with 3 sides of your choice as we opted for loaded mash potatoes, mac & cheese and corn bread. \n\nTo our disappointment, the ribs were a little salty & the flavor wasn't all that. The ribs were a little dry and not fall off the bone tender juicy. They also only had 3 types of sauces on the counter to choose from...one of which tasted like a mixture of mustard and ketchup. Still it was decent sauce. Not really sure what it was, maybe I got caught off guard because it was almost closing time, or maybe the meat wasn't as fresh or maybe I was just expecting too much from all the hype.\n\nMaybe I should have said something or ask for recommendations and favorites...but I didn't want to make a big deal. Food was still good and plenty and did fill us up & even had left overs to take home.\n\nStill, I only knocked off 2 stars because of my expectations. Service was excellent, atmosphere and staff were very friendly. I do want to give them a second chance and maybe even try their famous outlaw burger. I definitely want to give them a higher rating. I mean I could be wrong, because everyone else seems to love their BBQ.\n\nPlease Rollin' Smoke ... Make me a believer and want to come back...because whether it was hype or not...the place is legit & deserves a second chance!"

It may have been that I was trying to read in the car, but actual street address or \"turn on this street to get here \" , I just couldn't find it.

I got the AYCE for a reason, since I'm in Riverside County it wasn't everyday I could visit even though I wish I could.\n\nThe one issue I had was the timeline with the AYCE. The place was a bit loud which was ok with me. When I purchased the AYCE the gentleman at the register said something about the time, since there was a very long line I didn't want to hold it up. In any case, I asked another employee about the time and for some reason he had no idea what I was talking about.  Well the thing is you only have a 1 hour window from the time you purchase it so remember that when you get the AYCE. Since the line gets pretty long you might wait up to 10-15 mins each time which limits you tasting their deliciousness. So keep that in mind.\n\nAnd last, they had no corn nuggets which was horrible. Thankfully I survived...."

(You know, so I could stuff more delicious meats into my expanding belly).\nThis was an impromptu visit- I had very little time to prepare, so little that I, (yes me) arrived wearing a pretty teal dress and high heeled boots. Clearly, I wasn't prepared for the feast of sauces and meats that was about to grace both my lips, and outfit. \nIt's tucked in a gritty strip mall in Vegas, off the strip, near a strip club, and paired, ironically, with a Christian radio station. (WTF?) \nWe pulled in after a convention, at 6pm, and headed into the small storefront, as the 5-0 pulled someone over in the lot. The interior is coated in a mural, some yellow paint and stocked full of picnic tables in the color of barbecue sauce. (Appropriately) If you make your way towards the giant pig-head mounted chest high on the wall, you'll find the menus. Or read it from the ordering stand in the back right, where you can see a glimpse of the kitchen through a swinging door as you await blurting out your overly excited order.\n\"Meaty sampler for two, for me, but add a half pound of burnt tips, just the tips, that's what she said, sorry, I can't help myself, I meant burnt ends.\" the guy behind the counter chuckled, and asked what sides, sizing me up in my frilly girly attire. \"Corn nuggets\" that was the moment. The defining moment of the night. (I also got the Mac & cheese and greenbeens- a girl's gotta be sensible) \nI gladly exchanged my cash for the idea that I'd soon have my hands (among other things) on this highly renowned meat.\nWe found an empty picnic table in the side room, and I filled it with napkins and little cups of barbecue sauces in preparation. As I anxiously awaited my trays of food, I was entertained by the 5-0 who were busy just outside the window arresting two hoodlums and launching them into a paddy-wagon. Dinner-and a show? #Winning.\nI heard my name. \"Meg-Ann\" (close enough) and jumped up to claim my anticipated treasure. Before me was a tray coated with shredded chicken, smoked sausage, ribs, BBQ chicken and brisket. \nI'm fairly certain my eyes grew to a third the size of my face, and I began drooling as I inhaled the scent of southern deliciousness. A second tray graced my presence- I got so giddy I *almost* peed. There they were, Corn-freaking-nuggets. \nI squealed. The entire room responded to my outburst.\nBurnt ends. Ooey, gooey, meaty, melty tips of immense flavor and fat and fabulous that trumped everything else..., everything, that is, but the corn nuggets. Those little fuckers could easily be responsible for my crossing over from the fit-side, to the obese, type 2, side. And all without question. They're sweet, crunchy, and tender, and easily justified by the fact that they contain a vegetable (not that corn is an exemplary veggie). I allowed a few before it began. I rolled my shoulders back, tossed my hair behind them, and wiggled my fingers before diving into the trough of meat before me.\nI really can't explain what happened in those first few minutes. I remember the blue and red lights flashing across my face, lighting my blond hair in a blaze of color, as I mauled through flavors of carnal deliciousness. There was sauce everywhere... My face, my cheek, my forehead.... My hands, my arms, the table, my dress? And even some on the napkins I laid in preparation.\nI don't think I had a fork. Maybe I had one, but in the whirl of BBQ sauce and meat stuffs, and smokey flavor and blue and red lights and burnt ends, I can't see where it fit in, how, or if.\nI annihilated the burnt ends. They were truly the best and most succulent bits of yum that graced my lips (hair/face/clothing....) they didn't need the sauces, so I saved them for the chicken. All the meat was tender, busting with smoky flavor, and cooked with love. (Or lard. I get those two confused) \nI wasn't able to eat it all. Those sit-ups only allowed for a slight expansion of my diaphragm, and I wasn't capable of shoveling any more deliciousness in. I tried. I tried so hard. And it was worth the carnage. The other patrons stared at me like I was a mystical unicorn vomiting rainbows. The girl they saw walk in morphed into a ravenous monster hell bent on BBQ domination.\nThis was, by far, my favorite BBQ experience of my existence. I'm still questioning whether they laced the meat with LSD or some other psychotropic drug that could explain the transformation that took place that night. But I'll chalk it up to all that \"love\" they used in making my meaty meal.\nYelp- this place knows BBQ, just don't be afraid to lose yourself in the magic and mayhem that is Rollin Smoke. \nSide note- if you do come here on any type of psychotropic drug- be weary the wall mural- lots of faces- staring, judging, watching, waiting to steal what you don't swallow....."

Since it was our first time here, I wasn't sure which sides to decide on so I did what any newbie would do, ask the cashier for her suggestions.  To my surprise, Jessica's rude reply in a rude tone was \"everything is popular, just pick something!\"\n\nI was kind of taken aback, even if I was trying to be understanding that it is dinner time & there were five other people behind me.\n\nThe food was a 3.5, maybe 4-star, but I am deducting the 1-star for Jessica's rudeness.  Out of the five meats, I liked the pork ribs and pulled pork the most.  The hot links were pretty good as well.  Although, the chopped up beef briskets were dry & flavorless, but the BBQ sauce definitely helped.  The chicken was ok.\n\nThe three sides we chose included dried up mac 'n cheese which was very plain & dry.  The infamous corn nuggets were pretty interesting, but not as delicious as they looked in the photos.  They ran out so we had to wait about 10 minutes after our food arrived for the corn nuggets.  However, the baked beans were the saving grace of those three choices...I pretty much ate the whole thing to myself."

Having been eating at Rollin Smoke for several years now, they've experienced massive growth. The restaurant was featured on a television show named Tanked recently. Tanked is a show about building custom aquariums for people and businesses, and the one they did for Rollin Smoke is full of exotic fish and is in their newly expanded room.\n\nThe outlaw burger is a must try if you're just visiting from another city. It's basically a meatloaf type burger with onion rings on top, and tastes just amazing. \n\nFor those of you that have already had the outlaw burger, I suggest getting the multiple meat platter with some sides. I like to get ribs, brisket, and chicken.\n\nI would have given this place five stars last year, but this year it's four stars because they are always busy now, the lions are getting longer, and the portions seem to be getting smaller. They also changed their sweet potato side recipe, and I like the first version of this not the new one.\n\nRegardless, I'm still going to continue to come back because there is no barbecue place like it anywhere near this part of town."

They have a large menu behind the register but they also have individual ones hanging on the wall for you to look at while waiting in line. \n\nI was really tempted to get AYCE (all you can eat) for $34.99. You start off with three meats and then keep going til your heart's content. What was enticing about it was that beef ribs are included and the AYCE is equivalent to a full rack in price. I told myself to be rational. \"You JUST got to Vegas. There's so many places you want to eat at today. Don't jeopardize that by tapping out at the first restaurant.\"\n\nUsing my head, I ordered a 1/2 rack of beef ribs but then self-control went out the window when I also ordered the brisket 3 ways. I figured my daughter and I can share; don't judge. = p My husband went with the duo of choice of meats; he chose chicken and spareribs. \n\nI sorely underestimated the size of the beef ribs. See, I'm from the SF Bay Area and in my experience, it's been difficult to find places that serve decent beef ribs, or beef ribs at all for that matter. There are 2 places I found and well, they weren't very meaty at all. I ain't trying to pay for for mostly all bones. \n\nAnyways, I was full from one rib and a couple pieces of burnt ends. My daughter couldn't even finish one rib. By the way, they fell right off the bone and were fork-tender. Dip some in a bit of sweet country sauce, and oh my. So gooood! Side note, the sweet country sauce wasn't even sweet. It was thin and more on the mustardy/vinegary side, which I prefer over sweet bbq sauces. \n\nMy husband took a bite of chicken and murmured \"oh my god.\" He then took a bite of his spareribs and made a noise of appreciation. He was pretty much non-communicative for the rest of his mea, which didn't last very long because he devoured that ish. \n\nWe got a chance to meet Chef Will. He was super nice!

The first order was cancelled b/c Rollin Smoke said that they were too busy. I called the store and the manager said put the order through again and it wouldn't be a problem. That they were busy but the order would be ready in 60-90 mins. Slow, but I didn't mind much. I thoroughly discussed the order w/ him as the phone call took about 20 minutes. \n\nWhen the order arrived it is completely wrong! I made a $125 dollar order and couldn't even get the order correct. I called the next day to relay my complaint to the manager, but they were closed. I called back a few days later and an associate told me that there was not a manager who could help me nor was there anyone else at the business who could help me that was in the store. I wasted my time and money, I would not purchase again."

The place itself looks pretty dumpy but don't let that distract you because the food is wonderful. I've ordered the pound of pulled pork to go a few times to make sandwiches at home (didn't want the whole meal deal). Always good but they give you a small amount of bbq so if you like a lot you need to order more. Also, there is always a piece of bread on the bottom which I decline because if you plan on not eating right away it ends up stuck to the meat. It is still my favorite bbq spot in Vegas. Other places just don't seem to have that wonderful smokiness to the meat that Rollin Smoke does so well."

The flavor was different.  It has a tang to it. The Kicken beans also had a unique taste which was heavy on the bell pepper. \n\nThe mac n' cheese had an extremely liquid cheese sauce. My cousin enjoyed it. Me, well, it was acceptable. I prefer more of a casserole consistency in mac n' cheese.\n\nRibs and brisket were tender.

There is enough food there for 3 adults, or eat some and take some home. Such a deal!  And there is no charge for extra plates. \n\nThe owners run the place, and are always present. They are very friendly, and love to meet new patrons. We loved the meal and the staff so much, we came here a second time during our week in Las Vegas just to try more foods. We loved everything we tried. If they take a liking to you, they just might tell you about some items in the kitchen that are not on the menu. Ask about the bread pudding and sweet potato pie!\n\nWhat would give it 5 stars?  Esoteric things only. This business has not been in its current location for long. Hopefully they will continue to improve the seating and decor as they go along. \n\nDusty, if you are reading this, Hello from California. We'll be back!"

Was hungry and ready to eat after a long day of work, Rollin Smoke is now up at the top of my list for BBQ. I had the trio combo with chopped brisket, pulled pork, and 2 spare ribs with a Mac and cheese side. The brisket was a bit too much pepper for me, but the house sauces were a great compliment to balance it out. The ribs were good too, nice smoky taste and not overpowering. I ended up throwing some of the brisket in the Mac and cheese to offset the amount of cheese and tang up the straight forward Mac and cheese side I had. \n\nOverall the meats are enough to attract any BBQ lover a few blocks away from the strip. Will be back and be trying some of the other sides, but the meatloaf platter was calling my name and plan on that the next time."

I lived in NC for several years and really missed having great barbeque. This has filled the void.\n\nFirst the meat, I had pulled pork sandwich and my husband had two meat option, pulled pork and brisket. They were both awesome! Cooked nicely on the smokers outside, just enough sauce, not too much, perfect smokey flavor.  Next time I will try the links.\n\nThe sides were terrific too. So many places seem to haves sides as an after thought but not here. I had jalapeno coleslaw. It had a nice kick, not too much mayo, super flavorful. Husband had the beans. So good with extra chunks of meat and a smokey flavor. We were both stuffed at the end. All very affordable too! Two meat special, two sides, sandwich combo including drinks for both just $22.\n\nWith the great weather I wish they had more tables outside. I could lounge out there and smell the smokers all afternoon. I also wish they could sell beer since that pairs so nicely with barbeque. But that great meat trumps those issues. \n\nI've been to the other places in town and this one blows them away. We will be back soon!"

Also, food comes out no later than 10 minutes. I have a bbq place in Vegas that I ADORE, and I have to say Rollin Smoke gave them a little competition. Great experience. The only reason why I didn't give it another star and made it 4 stars- there's no room to eat peacefully. Its so small and cramped with a ton of people that it gets claustrophobic in there and I hate eating messy when someone 3 feet away can see me pigging out haha!

And while I like Lucille's here, that's more Cajun than the stuff I grew up with.\n\nOn a whim, we found this place.  It's in the middle of nowhere, in an area you probably wouldn't venture to, in a tiny shopping center that you wouldn't notice.  But you'll notice that smell when you step out of the car.  And I mean BAM!\n\nOnce that scent hit my nose, I had to know more.  Also, not Texas based, I will graciously concede that Arkansas knows their stuff, and this place knows their stuff.\n\nThe staff is nice, and one look at them told me these people weren't anything but legit.  I liked the cook immediately.  We ordered a rib combo plate, and let the dining begin.\n\nIt was so good.  Nice and spicy, meat falling off the bone, a big squirt bottle of sauce on the table, I ate and ate and ate, and then I got kind of woozy, and asked for a \"to go\".  I moaned all the way home.  Partly because I was full, yes, but partly because this place hit the sweet spot of barbecue goodness.  I went for my leftovers, and shredded bones like a barbarian.\n\nI regret nothing.\n\nWill I go back?  Absolutely.

However, I had to break out of the rut and order the BBQ meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  Best ever!!  My hubby and I split it, we ate at 3:00 and didn't eat another thing until breakfast the next morning!!   Would do it again...oh in 2 years or so.  I think I will be working off those calories until then:). But SO worth it!"

            "review": "My brother brought my mother and me here a while ago after reading the splendid reviews about it. We arrived sometime at night when it was pitch dark, and the place looked like it was straight out of a horror movie: It was dead quiet, and there were no lights around; the only thing to illuminate the dark night was the ominous flicker of the defective red \"Open\" sign. My mother and I were ready to bolt and drive straight back home to enjoy a dinner in safety, but my brother urged us on, so we reluctantly pushed open the door to Rollin Smoke Barbeque, and boy, did the atmosphere change!\n\nBehind the dingy exterior waits a warm, casual, and welcoming locale that can only be described as a home away from home. The types of customers who eat here range anywhere from families with small children to single men with their buddies. The walls are painted with cheerful people, flowers, and green, and there are TVs for people to enjoy a little bit of entertainment while eating. \n\nOur orders came out quickly and were delectable. The meat was tender, soft, and buttery smooth at the same time, and the flavor was just perfect. At the end of our dinner, the owner even came out to talk to us, asking us if it was our first time, explaining to us how he prepares the meat, and giving us some insight on the Arkansas way of barbeque-ing. \nThis must have been one of my most memorable restaurant visits, and I love how it ended. Definitely do not be scared off by the awkward storefront. This place is worth it."

Beautifull color and all around good flavor. Chopped brisket and pulled pork alot of places can do pork. \n\nI would say they would need to work on. I like a variety of sauces, they didnt have much. Spicey , sweet or vinigar. Bathrooms...place to wash after eating good bbq. 1 small single room. Also it gets busy and tables are hard to come by. \n\nI would definitly get it again.

I was looking for a place to have a relaxed team dinner and wanted to get away from the glitz for a bit.  Also, the team loves BBQ, so that was the criteria.\n\nWe went to RollinSmokeBBQ and this restaurant is just great.  Excellent tasting BBQ - the baby back ribs, brisket, hot links - just awesome.  Easy, casual ambiance.  Family owned business.  The owners were very accommodating to us.  The pictures on their website don't really show it but they have two small dining areas - the main area where you order your food, and then another separate eating area off in another room to the side.  That room can easily hold 30 people.  My group of twenty arrived, we sat down, ordered, grabbed drinks and the evening just got rolling.  It was easy as that.\n\nWe ordered 20 'all you can eat' packages but had the restaurant just bring it all out family style and place it on the tables.  The team dug in like piranhas - it was excellent.  It didn't take long for everyone to be bursting full.\n\nAll the food was great.  Excellent, friendly service.  The owners were very appreciative of our business.  After the meal, it was a nice walk back to the strip.  \n\nI highly recommend the RollinSmokeBBQ for your next Vegas team gathering."

In addition, our table also had the short ribs and meatloaf of all things and to say say they were delicious would not be enough.  Eat here for great prices great tasting BBQ, it's as simple as that.\n\nCON:\nThe only downside I could find and the reason for the 4 stars vice 5 is the wait time.

So I ordered, a la carte, a beef rib (gigantic!), a piece of white chicken and a piece of catfish. I dare you to find that \"combination\" at any other BBQ place in town. \nIt was sensational!\n\nOh and I almost forgot, one of the best burgers in town (next to Fat Choy) aptly named the \"Outlaw Burger\". \nYou eat The Outlaw Burger, and when you go outside, your car has magically morphed into a tricked-out Harley!!\n\nIf you're a local, you're crazy to go anywhere else.\nIf you're a visitor, it's half a mile from the strip, just down the road from the Trump Tower.\n\n\nSide note: \nThey should do a reality show at Rollin' Smoke. \nIf Pawn Stars, and Duck Dynasty, can be successful cable shows, a show set at this place can be blindingly, staggeringly successful! \nKind of a combination between the Diner shows and the Down-Home shows.\nMore pleasure; more heart."

These guys know how to smoke meat, the bark is awesome and the smoke ring is perfect! The Outlaw burger is EPIC, it's made with their smoked brisket and is about 6\" tall when served, good luck getting this in your mouth. The wife's ribs were cooked perfectly to competition standards and man what a flavor. \n\nWe had to go back for round 2 and hit the place up on Saturday April 19th. This time I got the smoked meat loaf and a hot link, the wife got 3 types of ribs, the pork, the baby back and the beef rib. The meat loaf was the best I have ever had, smoked meat loaf is the the only way to make meat loaf, I can't wait to try it in my smoker! The wife's pork ribs were perfect again, but wait the beef rib is the bell ringer! This thing is actually prime rib on a stick (rib) it's about 3\" thick and done perfectly, the smoke ring, bark and flavor are the radical, this is smoked prime rib at its finest. My only dig would be the hot link wasn't cooked enough (luke warm), but the flavor was great. We will be back, every time we are in Vegas, I can't wait!!\n\nOn another note you'll be safe at this place, every cop in town eats there. 3 squad cars were in the parking lot when we pulled up and then 3 more showed up when we were eating. I don't know who was covering the streets of Vegas, but they were all eating well! I had to have the tee shirt, way to go Rollin smoke!"

It is located on a shady looking street near an overpass.  Get your GPS ready or you will miss it.  The parking is pretty small so you may not be able to find parking but there is also street parking.  There are tables outside in the patio but there are a number of tables inside as well.  You order by lining up on the right and then grabbing a table where the servers will bring you the platters of food.\n\nFor the five of us, we got the The Pit Special and the Ribs Platter.  It was more than enough food for us.  The best items in the meals were the sides.  The meats themselves were a bit dry (mainly the ribs) so I focused my eyes on the sides.  Of all the sides, I enjoyed the mac and cheese and the corn nuggets.  A must get when you are there.  Of the meats, even though most were dry, I liked the brisket and the baby-back ribs.  There were a couple types of sauces near the drink counter (honey mustard and a vinegar sauce).  Also on the table was a barbeque-like sauce.  But even with the sauces, the meats were still dry...  Such a bummer but I would still give this place another try.  I noticed the table next to us ordering a huge burger that was stacked like 6 inches high.  Crazy fatty goodness I bet and I wish because that is what I'm going to be grabbing when I come again."

We also ordered the meal that said 2 to 4 people for $35.00 and was 2 small sides and 4 small biscuits and all the meat was in one styrofoam tray and didn't even come close to feeding 4 people. So $64.00 dollars was a good meal for 2."

I'm not comparing NC BBQ to Vegas BBQ, but some of the side items tasted a bit off and the prices were high.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese. I should have noticed the word \"pulled\" pork as it has a different mouth feel than chopped pork. The pork itself was smoky and tender. Long strips of pork inside a hoagie roll. I added coleslaw to the top which was a mistake. The coleslaw (ugh) had chucky bits of cabbage stalk, jalapenos, carrots, corn and I swear I saw bacon in the mix. It wasn't sweet and it wasn't salty; It added nothing to the meal. The mac and cheese on the other hand was delicious. Oddly enough, it tasted like potatoes au gratin I just bought from the store. \n\nAside from that awful coleslaw experience I would go back but not to order the pulled pork sandwich. The prices are a bit high and I wish tried something that was just amazing! I will have to go back when they aren't charging full prices such as after 5pm. Perhaps, the ribs and brisket are better."

I got the stock flavor and did not ask for options so partially my fault. My wife loved it so much she ate the trio burger without missing a step. I had the meatloaf with an extra side of Mac and cheese. The portions are a good size and get a free dessert with a check in.

I ordered the two meat plate with pulled chicken and pulled pork and for my side I chose the baked beans. 10 minutes later my food was ready. First, I tried the pulled pork and the pulled chicken and both were less then impressive. I used some BBQ sauce that I had at home to spruce up the meat. Next, I tried the baked beans. The beans were good, I liked the chunks of brisket and I think their house BBQ sauce tastes better when it is cooked into something. Lastly, the peach cobbler was inedible.

            "review": "As a foodie who grew up in Kansas City, my great frustration with the Las Vegas food scene for many years was the absence of authentic wood-smoked barbecue.  The dirty little secret of the BBQ business is that a lot of it isn't smoked, but just baked in a regular oven.  Oven-baking is a zillion times easier - no fire to tend, no smoke burning your eyes - but it lacks the delicious smokeyness that BBQ fanatics live for.  You will never see a wisp of smoke coming out of Famous Dave's, Lucille's, or Memphis Championship.  But if you drive up to Rollin' Smoke, you'll see the smokers billowing away right in their parking lot.  Rollin' Smoke, Top Notch (both relatively new) and Annie's Kitchen (open for a while now, but not in the best neighborhood) are the only three BBQ joints in Las Vegas where they actually smoke the meat.  And believe me, once you've tasted the difference, you'll never go to the oven-baked frauds again.\n\nFor BBQ lovers who must know:  hickory is the wood of choice at Rollin' Smoke, the dry rub is fairly mild, and their sauce is closest to the sweet Memphis variety.  If you're not that concerned with the fine-print details, suffice it to say that Rollin' Smoke is exactly what barbecue should be:  smokey, meaty, and falling-off-the-bone tender.  If you're looking for a LOT of meat for a terrific price, go with the St. Louis ribs, the $12 half rack feeds two normal adults or one BBQ glutton.  The $20 full rack should easily feed a family of four; the size of the rack is straight out of The Flintstones.  While most people prefer babybacks because of their tenderness, my problem with babybacks is that there just isn't enough meat on them.  My eyes popped when I saw the babybacks at Rollin' Smoke because I've never seen babybacks anywhere (well OK, not in Kansas City, Memphis or Texas - 3 of the 4 \"capitals\" of BBQ) with so much meat on the bones - all the tenderness of babybacks but twice as much meat.\n\nThere are plenty of other great items on the menu.  The pulled pork and beef brisket are both winners.  For lovers of Texas-style, they even offer beef ribs, done to perfection (beef ribs are a lot trickier than the pork kind).  My favorite side dish is the bacon potato salad.  The mac & cheese is great too.  One side to avoid is the yams, which I thought were blechy.  True to the owner's roots, two Southern classics are available for dessert:  banana pudding and peach cobbler.  They also serve up a blackberry cobbler which is pretty good (even though I don't like blackberries).  Two caveats before you eat here: 1) be very specific about what you're ordering, because mixups can happen; and 2) order less than you think you can eat, because the portions are huge.  If you're looking for food late on a Fri or Sat night, Rollin' Smoke is open until 1:30 a.m. - a far better option than the overpriced mediocrity of casino coffeeshops.\n\nThe typical BBQ joint is formica tables and white plaster walls, bare except for a few pictures of the owner posing with whatever celebrities have eaten there.  Rollin' Smoke is a bit nicer than most because it took over its space from a failed restauranteur whose background was interior design, not food.  But forget the interior, all you need for ambience is a view of those beautiful billowing smokers in the parking lot."

Like a typical Yelper I checked out the reviews immediately after seeing his post. I was impressed that they have so many reviews and 4 1/2 stars average rating, you really can't beat that. To be quite honest and I hate to put it this way but Rollin' Smoke is meritocracy at it's finest. My friend and I shared the pit special with brisket, pulled pork, chicken and ribs with sides of fried onions, mac n cheese and corn bread. We also ordered banana pudding for desert. I hate to say it, but my favorite part of the meal was the fried onions.. Yah, sad I know? The ribs were pretty tasty, but everything else was kind of blah. I can't really go into detail, maybe because it wasn't that good to me or memorable. Maybe it was a bit too authentic for my liking or the possibility they BBQ theirs Arkansas style. I'm only guessing the owners of this BBQ joint are from Arkansas considering they have University of Arkansas memorabilia around the place.  I tried a BBQ place out last week and I would definitely choose them over Rollin' Smoke. I was not a fan of the sauce either, to the point I scraped it off ribs. The prices here are pretty reasonable, so I can't complain about that. The inside of the restaurant is really rough around the edges, but maybe that's the vibe they are going for? To add to that, the restaurant is the oddest place one could think of. Pretty sketchy in some ways, but that doesn't turn customers away considering there was a good amount of people eating there on a Tuesday night. I was really expecting a lot from this place, but I should of ordered the cat fish like I originally planned?"

Well hell, I ain't ashamed to say it - I love me some barbeque!    Yeehaw!\n\nI spent a good bit a time in Texas, so it ain't no surprise Texas barbeque ranks up there on my list of the some of the best eats this here world's got to offer - brisket, ribs, sausage and of course, smoke. There's this little barbeque shack in Austin that smokes its brisket for 16 hours, can you believe that - 16 hours? It comes out crispy and as black as coal on the outside but just as juicy as all get out on the in, with the prettiest pink smoke ring, it just about makes you wanna cry. Why, I spect it's about as close to heaven as one could ask for. The fella who runs this place is a real arteest - leavin' just the perfect amount a fat to make that brisket as moist as a Guadalupe mud pie. Anyway, when I thinks of barbeque, well, that's what comes to mind.\n\nSo it ain't no surprise to the folks that knows me that Rolling Smoke Barbeque just doesn't cut the brisket - or rather, it cuts too much of the brisket. Where's my crispy, burnt, smoky edge, where's my juicy, tender beef, and where's my smoke ring - what the hell did you do with my smoke ring? Boy, angels is weeping in Amarillo.\n\nNow don't get me started on them there sausages - they's got so much flavor, why did you have to go and overcook it like that? I mean this stuff was drier than a West Texas desert. It's a good thing them corn fritters was damn tasty (course, I'd had better) or I'da went to bed hungry that night.\n\nOkay, I'll admit it, for Vegas this shit ain't bad - hell it just might be the best barbeque joint in town, but that's no damn excuse. \n\nFor pete's sake stop cutting off the good stuff  for dem sissy-pant  intellectual types from Henderson. They's so terrified of this part of town anyway, they drive in and out of here so fast you'd think their asses was on fire. \n\nThis is barbeque dammit! People's food. We knows its got fat, we knows its got calories, we knows it ain't healty, but that's the way we likes it - if we's wanted healthy we'd go to Henderson. Besides, it'a give us a chance to put a scare in dem locals up there.\n\nShit gets a 3 cause this is Vegas, but don't go thinkin I'm all happy or anythin'. Ya'll make me miss Texas."

But Brisket is always a good idea, even if served by the jesters.  \n\nThe meats are fine and the BBQ sauce is tasty, but they are stingy with their sauces and that's just pathetic at any rodeo. I will judge a BBQ joint by their sauce flavor and amount. Duh. \n\nI wanted real southern food and went for the catfish prematurely. It honestly reminded me of why some folks are afraid of catfish. Maybe I say this because I've had the pleasure of enjoying truly authentic southern catfish with collards greens and black eyed peas on the side. Speaking of which, I wanted all the fixings and sides with my ribs and meatloaf and I didn't get everything I wanted but I did get mac and cheese. And chicken wings. Fair enough. Could step it up though. And that's the real gist of this place: It's good but could always improve. \n\nThe menu is larger than a lot of holey BBQ stops that I'm used to, but we are in Vegas. I'll have to keep that in mind, come again and try more. The 3 stars are because I don't believe the hype, taste and prices all align."

Peach cobbler was sweet with chunks of bread. Banana pudding was no good. It was just pudding with hard cookies and no bananas. \n\nThe only knock is CONSISTENCY.

They have picnic tables in the area you order, a dining room connected, and then a completely separate room with some more picnic tables. Oh a few tables outside too. So I found a table in the dining room, which I shared with some people I didn't know, but none of us minded. \nWe ordered brisket, pork, and chicken. For our sides we got waffle fries and loaded mash. Everything was delicious. Pork was so tender and juicy. Brisket was tender and was cooked perfectly. I didn't eat the chicken but my husband said it was really good. Everything had wonderful flavor. I like that they didn't drench it in BBQ sauce. There is sauce on all the tables so you can drench it if you want. The brisket came on a really soft piece of white bread. The sides were hot and delicious.  We also ordered the peach cobbler a la mode and it was ok. I would say it was my least favorite thing. It just didn't stand out to me, but it wasn't bad. I just didn't love.  We Really enjoyed eating here and are definitely coming back!  The staff was very nice. They all had smiles on their faces even though they were slammed"

Some have great meat, some have great sauce, but none had both.. until now.\n\nHubby and I went with a friend to try this place out and left with full tummies and happy faces.\n\nFirst, ambiance.. it's a tiny place inside an industrial strip mall next to an overpass.. the word \"dive\" was invented for this place, I believe.  Trust me, you won't care.  The new tables inside are nice, though.\n\nService.. great!\n\nNow for the best part.. the food.  The sides were average to good, but we didn't try a lot of them.  Cole slaw was \"interesting\", mac n cheese was \"okay\", baked beans were \"good!\" .. but we forgot those as soon as we bit into our meats.\n\nI had the pulled pork sandwich, the \"Piggy\", which came with a side and a drink.  The sandwich was enormous.. first thing I did was cut it in half for taking home half of it.  Then I bit into it and all my taste buds jumped up and did a cheer.  It was the most incredible pulled pork I've ever had.  Superlatives abound.. juicy, tender, meaty, saucy, omg nom nom nom.  I'll be honest.. that other half never stood a chance of going home, I ate it all.\n\nHubby couldn't decide so he got a half rack each of the baby back pork ribs and the beef ribs.  He was exclaiming about how incredible the pork ribs were and then he tried the beef, completely forgot the pork was there.  He's definitely a beef ribs guy, always prefers those, and found a level of beef rib heaven he hadn't known existed.  And the size of those beef ribs?  Definitely brontosaurus sized, massive amount of meat on each rib.  \n\nOur friend got \"The Biggin\" sandwich and the brisket sandwich.  He devoured the Biggin and was making lots of strange noises, occasionally coming up for air to proclaim the food amazing.  The brisket arrived a bit later, and brought out a new level of attention - he said it was as tender as a pulled pork sandwich and we all were amazed that there was moist and tender brisket, because every other bbq joint manages to dry the meat out.  Since he has two hollow legs, he ate every bite of both of those monster sandwiches.\n\nThe prices are cheap, the food is amazing, and it's probably good that they're not located closer to home ;D.  I'm willing to bet that the Pitmaster there gets marriage proposals on a daily basis, because of his great food.  Hubby was ready to ask for a divorce so he could marry him, and I would have understood... ;)"

I am not a BBQ connoisseur or really even a BBQ fan, but I had family in town and we wanted to try some place new. \n\nIt was a little difficult to find, but I had driven by Rollin Smoke while I was in the area on a previous occasion so knew generally where it was located. We had initially attempted to go to Peppermill, but the wait was longer than we were willing to eat, so I made the executive decision to try Rollin Smoke. It's in a pretty inconspicuous location, so keep your eyes peeled. \n\nThe restaurant was much larger and nicer looking than I had expected. Roomy, with plenty of seating, even booths which I always prefer, and very clean. You order at the podium and they bring your food out to you. Since there was a free dessert with Yelp check-in offer, I took advantage of this and ordered the pulled piggy sandwich with jalapeno coleslaw and peach cobbler. Our food came out quickly and everything smelled and tasted great! The meat was pretty good. I'm no expert, but I enjoyed my pulled pork quite a bit. The coleslaw was spicy and tasted pretty good. The cobbler was great too, but I would ask for no whipped cream next time. My family all love their meals as well. Some of the sides were hit or miss, but some of our favorites were the corn nuggets and coleslaw. The mac n cheese was ok, but I'd have to order it again to see if I like it better next time. \n\nTheir menu is quite extensive and they have so many great options that I look forward to exploring on our next visit. Overall, the experience was great and if they were in a more convenient location I could see myself coming here much more often. They have an all you can eat option for $25. I don't think I could handle it, but it seems like a pretty good deal. They also have family packs available for large parties, which is great."

But thanks to Rollin' Smoke Barbeque, this same area will also be known for down to earth, simply delicious BBQ. \n\nOn a recent weekday evening, a handful of coworkers decided to meet here post work to try some BBQ that Nelson Q has proudly put his 5 Yelp stars stamp of approval on. In typical fashion, I was the first to arrive.  The parking lot was empty except for 2 cars, all the other businesses were closed, and there was a guy in suits finishing his early dinner.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very low key. It housed nothing flashy in terms of decorations, except for a big boar's head mounted on one of the walls. The lobby/ordering counter is in a small room, but the main dining area is in the adjacent room. The seats are comfortable, and there is a TV for you to watch sports or highlights, while you wait for your order.\n\nMost of us opted to try the Outlaw Burger. For $6.99 + tax, this burger is the size of two of my fists stacked on top of each other.  It is packed with a 1 lb patty (60% brisket and 40% ground beef) and cooks down to about 12 oz, served with Rollin' Smoke's homemade tangy BBQ sauce, the usual vegetable fixings and some (lettuce, tomato, fried onions, scallions, and cheese) which not only made it physically big but the flavors complimented each other and resulted in a mean serving of burger that I can easily recommend to anyone not opposed to eating pork and beef.  For $2, you get a drink and choice of one side (bacon potato salad would be a good pick), and make your order a combo.  Currently there is also a Yelp Check-In promotion, where you get a complimentary dessert with your order.\n\nRollin' Smoke BBQ, now my personal #1 one pound burger in LV.\n\nDecor:  3/5  No frills hole in the wall restaurant. You are here because you want good BBQ, not design ideas for your Texas ranch.\n\nFood:  4/5  Good BBQ made with passion and love.  They serve Blue Belle ice cream too (coworkers said it reminded them of the ice cream in the Philippines. I will take their words for it.)\n\nValue:  4/5  Good for the wallet. I estimate that 65%+ of you will not be able to finish the Outlaw Burger, side + drink.\n\nLocation:  5/5  Not far at all if you are visiting the Strip.  The cabbies will probably know it too, if not, it is just down the street from Sapphire. \n\nParking:  5/5  It is practically all for Rollin' Smoke BBQ customers.\n\nEasily 4 stars!\n\nP.S.  If you stop by during lunch, I heard this is where some of them sirens get their lunch/breakfast before/after work. So I've heard."

Everything I've ever had here was great, but my go-to is the pulled port sandwich with hush puppies and sweet tea. If you like spicy food, be sure to ask for a side of their Hot Damn (or is it Damn Hot -- I can never remember) sauce, which is a very spicy version of their house made BBQ sauce. It's awesome. My mouth is watering just thinking about Rollin Smoke. \n\nThey are soon to be opening a second location in the Pawn Star's new container park, just a few blocks above the north end of The Strip."

I ate godanm near the whole fucking thing in one sitting, and I know my 150 lb twenty three year old son could have wiped the whole thing out. Maybe from Bakersfield our appetite for Que is a bit too much? Anyhow very good food, very nice people and the food was very fast too, literally within five minutes I had my food. I will come back if I am in the area. Highly recommended!"

I was SHOCKED at all the great reviews.  Is someone buying the Yelp reviews here?  Its seems insane they have so many 5 stars from people who claim to have traveled to good BBQ?\n\n- BBQ was a little dry, seasoning ok.  2 out of 5 if you've had great BBQ and traveled the world.\n- WAAAAYYYYYYY over priced for portions and quality.  Did I mention WAY over priced.  $33 for a lousy small helping of ribs.  \n- Outlaw Burger?  Should be outlawed.  Horribly tiny and meat is awful.  Tastes like they put filler all in it of some time.  So gross meat I spit out one bite.  I dont know where that big burger they have on the Yelp photos is but thats not.  Bait and switch you ask me.\n- Only one BBQ sauce on the table - and liquidy weak.\n- We had 3 ketchup bottles completely empty.  Very old employee came round and just shrugged when we complained like \"owell.\"\n- Fake pretentious BBQ poise with a couple lame pickles and bad white bread ends.\n- No air in main eatery, side eatery for parties has air.  Who wants to eat in a muggy bbq joint in Vegas.\n- Bathroom, borderline poor.  The toilet seat had been pulled off so I guess if you where a woman or someone you just had to squat.\n- Super loud inside so noisy you cant talk or hear yourself think.\n- To top it off in a real dumpy part of town with crappy parking. \n- Really comes off as some tourist trap judging by the price vs. quality.\n\nAlbeit the people where nice."

The complex/mini strip mall feels like someone's trying too hard to make their own little sandcastle come across as an empire. Tucked away on the side not visible to us immediately was Rollin' Smoke. \n\nThis was also part of my Vegas journey to find a good burger. Rollin' Smoke's got a burger called the Outlaw that they like to pile with brisket. People dig it, so I set out to try it out...only problem was, they were sold out.\n\nI settled for a Brisket Dog instead, because I enjoy a good potato chip sandwich every once in a while. \"Puttin' Things on Top of Other Things Cuisine\" is totally in my wheelhouse. If it was just the dog, the brisket and the Arkansauce that they serve up, I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more, but the cheese wiz on that sandwich really doesn't tie it together flavor-wise. I ended up scraping off the wiz after a couple bites, and it was much tastier that way.\n\nThe brisket...I dunno, man. I dunno what they do down in Texas that nobody else seems to be able to replicate, but this place didn't come close. It's just about Bludsoe's quality. Not quite salty and flavorful enough. Much as I hate being a locale champion, any BBQ that I've had outside of Texas just doesn't cut it anymore. I don't know what it is. The group I was with had the same impressions. It's perfectly fine, and it may very well be the best BBQ in Vegas, but it's pretty low on the totem pole in terms of overall rankings. The links are nothing special, and neither was the pulled pork. I'm not a ribs guy, but one of my group dug the ribs. So maybe order that if they're out of Outlaw Burgers. :)\n\nWe did all like their side dishes, though, so they've got that working, and the service was quite nice. People were pleasant and attentive. I probably wouldn't revisit the place, but it's not like it was an unpleasant dining experience."

The earthy, mild spice rub that has deeply penetrated the proteins; a moist, beefy rib with tender sinew and rendered fat;  fall off the bone baby backs; \"suckably\" delicious cartilage of toothsome spareribs, and glistening slices of brisket.  The acrid, bitterness of the smoke ring in strong contrast to the almost sweet meat.   Food porn!\n\nThe sauce has a good vinegar kick that helps to cut the one dimensional flavor and cloying, richness that becomes more difficult to take the more you eat and the colder it gets.  \n\nTheir signature, bigger than any human's mouth, stuff falling out, BBQ sauce on your face \"outlaw\" burger is good eats.  Brisket, sauteed onions, peppers, fried onion strips, slaw, veg, cheese and a chipolte aioli; what's not to love?\n\nRemaining menu items less successful.  The breaded catfish and shrimp are both overcooked and rubbery.  The smoked meatloaf, excessively smoky and bitter.  Deep fried sides often oily with one exception, the outstanding cream corn nuggets.  Crispy on the outside, rich creamy corn goodness on the inside.\n\nPrices are very reasonable for the quantity.

No hi or hello, it was like we were annoying her. She treated everyone like this so I didn't feel singled out. We got our food, brisket sandwich and pulled piggy sandwich. I felt like the meat could only be saved by drowning it in sauce. Mac and Cheese and Cornbread was good, but I wanted great BBQ and it came up short. The restaurant is a weird layout too. If it's a cold day sit in the inner portion of the restaurant. The area by the order counter is by the door which never closes. Even the employees won't shut it when they go in and out, so it can get cold while you are eating. There are better BBQ joints in town...I suggest trying another place."

When we compared it to the duo plates my other friends got (which were less than $20 each) the size of our plate wasn't that much bigger than theirs. When I went up to question the cashier about it, he told me that the uploaded Yelp photo was meant for Photoshoot and the quantity was exaggerated for photo purposes. And then he proceeded to tell me that the sampler plate we got is what they actually intended to serve. At that point I was extremely upset with the false advertisement and started giving the cashier attitude. In my head I was thinking \"you scams......we are definitely leaving you guys 5 one star reviews.\" However, instead of taking it in negatively, the cashier took it really well. He told us he can solve the problem and will just give us more food to make up for it. The amount of food they brought out afterwards definitely exceeded what was shown in the Yelp photo. Our whole party really appreciated the awesome customer service and yummy food. We are also very satisfied with how fast the foods were brought out.

            "review": "Some of the best low-and-slow smoked BBQ we've had anywhere. This is the real deal. Rollin Smoke is so good at smoking their meat that they slice their brisket on the thick side, but the slices are still perfectly tender. It takes some serious smoking talent to be able to pull that off. \n\nWe tried their smoked meatloaf (with brisket in the meatloaf mix), spare ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. All were fantastic. Sides we tried were greens and mac-and-cheese, and it was clear they take pride in their sides as well. \n\nThis is a small place in a small strip-mall off the Vegas strip just east of the I-15 freeway. If you blink while driving by you might miss it. You order at a podium then go find a seat and they bring your food out to you. We were there at 4:30 PM on a Tuesday and there was no wait and ample seating available, but it's easy to see how Rollin Smoke might get very crowded and seating might be hard to come by during peak times. Parking might be challenging during peak times as well. \n\nThe prices they charge for their food represent an exceptional value in a tourist town like Las Vegas. For the price of a fancy appetizer on the strip you can have a 3-meat platter with a side and a drink. What a find!"

The only down side is that it is somewhat expensive. Good size meal will be almost $20, but you get a lot of food so it is well worth it. Also, expect to wait a while during lunch time, this place is very busy."

It's definitely one of the best burgers that I've had. \n\nMy second visit was crappy. I ordered take out late at night. My fiance was craving sweet tea so I made sure to order that first. No problem the lady said. The sweet tea actually comes with the meals that we placed free of charge. I go to pick up my food and she hands me two cups. I go to pour myself the sweet tea to go but it's empty. I go up to the counter to let the employee know. She apologizes and tells me that she'll get a new one out. I'm waiting for a good 10 minutes, maybe not realizing that it's been 10 minutes because I was on my phone. A male employee walks out from the back and starts cleaning up. I politely ask him if he knows that status of my sweet tea and I inform him that the previous employee said that she would have it brought out. Well apparently, she is now off her shift and he knows nothing about it. He tells me that unfortunately, they're out of sugar and so there's no sweet tea at all until they get a shipment. \n\nUmmm. Seriously? I realize that I'm the last customer there but they were a good hour away from their posted closing time. He apologizes for the inconvenience when in reality, he should have apologized for making up a piss poor lie and telling it to my face.  It's hard to believe that a establishment with that type of food would be out of sugar for it's sweet tea. I actually called the next day and lo and behold they did have sweet tea available. Hmmmm.\n\nAgain, they should be grateful that they're food is good."

I didn't think the chicken was as good compared to the the other meat options but the chicken was moist and good nonetheless. And LET'S TALK SIDES.

BBQ sauce is a HUGE deal to me, and theirs was just right, not too spicy, sweet, or acidic. Sides were perfect, I couldn't decide so I had greens, mac n cheese, beans and hush puppies. Everything was excellent, I really did appreciate the atmosphere, the fact that they pretty much just give you your food reminded me of the southern bbq culture. BBQ is not a fancy upscale experience where your given limited napkins, its fun and loose, they definitely have that down. I'll definitely make this a go to spot."

I made the mistake of ordering a beef rib on the side because I thought the dual meat combo of beef brisket and pulled pork was not gonna be enough because I was really hungry. The beef rib itself  does not look like it came from a cow because if it did, the cow would have been as big as an elephant!\n\nAs you can tell, the beef rib stole the show. So lets break down my other choices.\n\nFirst of all, those two black smokers you see outside are legit and im not talkin about Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre. They use hickory wood to smoke all their meats and it aint no joke! Their smoke flavoring is just one of their key ingredients that makes their barbeque so good. \n\nThe dual meat combo of beef brisket and pulled pork smothered with their signature barbeque sauce will definitely get your salivary glands working overtime. The brisket has just the right amount of smoke flavoring and if the pulled pork was any more tender, Elvis himself wouldnt be any more proud singing \"Love Me Tender\".\n\nAs much as I would of loved to try all their barbeque being the carnivore that I am, that only warrants another trip or three to accomplish that. I would also like to mention their sides. I chose the bacon potato salad, but if you ask me, I think you cant go wrong with any of them. Just recently, they added fried okra and corn to their menu.\n\nAs for the desserts, assuming that the button on your pants has not busted off already, the peach cobbler is literally the icing on the cake not to mention the banana pudding.\n\nSome random info: Yes they take cards. Yes they have sweet and unsweetened tea. Yes they have a decent amount of room with enough tables and chairs. Lastly but most importantly, their service is very remarkable (no surprise because they have the southern hospitality demeanor).\n\nOh, and one last thing. The area they are in is kind of suspect. Im not trying to scare you guys or anything, but the street they are on is dominated by strip clubs. Dont worry though, these guys are not open late so I dont see any problems, unless you are into strippers. LOL."

Ribs have just the right amount of mesq/hick smoke. Rib portions are proper, can stand alone w/o sauce, and well priced (avg $2.00 per bone). Not a fan of the potato salad to much mayo, not enough sugar and mustard. Bacon added to the potato salad is alright.

These are the best ribs that I have had in town.  They also have a ground beef/brisket hamburger that I am dying to try.  This place has no thrills but incredible food.  Highly recommended for the food and adventure."

I normally don't have a huge craving for BBQ, but maybe that's just because this town isn't especially known for it's fantastic BBQ. Rollin Smoke definitely changed that part of me. Since I first went there (about 3 weeks ago) I've been back 2 more times with a bunch of different people based on craving for that sweet magical BBQ they serve up. I feel like the more I eat there, the more wizard-like powers I will gain via BBQ sauce. Maybe I'm confusing that with my constant yearning for naps.\n\nIt is insanely delicious BBQ. Everything I've had there has been phenomenal. The pork, the chicken, and the burger...which I was unaware was insanely massive. I would recommend having the rest of your day planned for napping if you choose to eat the Outlaw Burger. It is tasty, but it is freaking enormous. It's got to weight a pound in your hands...It's a challenge to eat, but it's so good.\n\nThe sides are really great too. I keep trying new ones every time I go because they have a pretty significant list of options, so it's nice to switch it up and not be disappointed ever.\n\nI really loved this place, and I really like the location. I know it's not the most convenient place on the planet, but getting there is easy, and it's kind of buried. Like a little local treasure. Places like these keep me exploring this city for more delicious dishes.\n\nIf I had any complaints about this place the only one would be that it can leave you smelling very smokey after you leave for quite some time. Not the worst problem if you're trying to get eaten by bears who like tasty things, but if you're going to a meeting with a new client or something immediately after, I might consider going in with a 'BBQ outfit' if that's even a thing.\n\nIt's tasty. Go eat it."

I thought it was just good a place that i dont mind going to...On that occasion i ordered a half rack of ribs, mac and cheese, mashed and 2 beef ribs..  I thought it was good..\n\nI went here recently with a friend of mine.. This time I ordered the meatloaf.. It was absolutely the best meatloaf i have ever had EVER... Cheesecake factory has a version of this but it does not even compare to this... It sat on top of a bed of mashed potatoes with this bbq gravy,, topped with onion straws..  I believe they smoke the meatloaf... Whatever they do,, I am a big fan... It was one of those meals that you will remember..  My friend got the outlaw burger,, He really liked it and it was impressive when it was brought out...  It looked like a mess to eat,, but looked good..  The desserts are decent but this meatloaf was slap your mother good...  Hope this Yelps\n\n\n11/232014\nIt was about 11pm,,, i was really craving bbq,,  I remembered that Roling Smoke was open late... I ordered the rib combo... Lets just say dont come here for a late night meal,, at least this night...  All 3 meats were bone dry,, i asked for extra sauce,, but it wasnt  in my order,,, the sides were good,, but the berry cobbler,, seemed old... I have to admit it was after 11 but wow what a disappointment... I had to remove a star,,   I will try them when i think the meats would be freshest... Remember based on my experience,, I will not eat here again after 7 pm on a weekend..."

Ohh yes BBQ!\n    \n     ohh my goodness. The carnivore bug.. bit my neck; visions of falling off the bone goodness, sauces, and messy fingers! I just had to try out Rollin Smoke Barbecue!\n\n   Located behind fashion show mall, near all the \"adult\" stores.. a little shack... other people drive up ; 3 guys and a girl in another vehicle pull up and order before us in line.. Too bad these male law students can't pay for the girl.. she ordered last.. I was like \" Why are they not pitching in for a lady to eat at a BBQ!?\"  i guess they are all on \"friend status\" only.....\n\n   Special of the Day: Beef tips, with two sides and a drink for $13.00.. I got the LAST order. the gentleman i ordered from, w/ braids/dreads(dirty blond) was so nice and had the best hospitality.. it was so refreshing. \n\n    I want to try some chicken and pig.. so the Half Chicken and Half Spare Ribs was in order...\nMention a Check-in on Yelp and they will gladly honor a free dessert.. I asked\" What's the best to get?\"  the Braided gentleman in his accent.. \"the Banana one\".. i said \"let's go for it!\"\n\n   At last the food arrived and it easily feeds for 6. but my bf and I could finish these trays of food in two sitting!  wow, THe food here is just so different.. Smoky and not too sweet but the beef tip and ribs had a special zing... not too spicy. i just say .. ZING\" is the word and i liked it!\n\nWe chowed down.. even the loaded potato salad and chipotle Cole slaw was a nice accompaniment to the hearty meat. \n\nDessert! ohh my goodness real ripe banana and the pudding with the vanilla wafers and spray of whipped cream! i want one right now ! soo indulgent that i almost had a big \"O\" ..no i didn't but it made me think .. How much time did they really make this banana goodness in a cup?. was it just jello instant banana pudding and i'm just having a taste bud trip? \n\nSo... is it worth going to the Rollin? Yes! Go.and make sure to utilize the roll of paper towels on the table and don't get upset that your clothes smell like a Smoky BBQ plate!"

My sides were the dirty rice and the chipotle coleslaw. Let's get into the meat of it. The brisket was fantastic nice char not dry flavorful and delicious. The pulled pork is tender moist and succulent. The ribs were delicious flavorful and not even close to being dry. Lets get going to the sides.  the chipotle coleslaw was flavorful but not overly creamy. Just the way I like it! The dirty rice was fantastic combination of rice ground beef red onion and something else I couldn't tell what it was. I had all this for the paltry price of $24 it was a great deal for the amount of food that I got.\n\nThe Bad. It was a little bit of a drive from the strip, but that's not a problem because to find places like this you have to get away from the strip. Places like this that are affordable with great food are not always on the strip.\n\nThe Ugly. When I was done I wanted more and more and more. This could've gotten ugly."

The meat we had as our dinner were- ribs (fall off the bone when you pick them up) brisket (tender and it's got that gorgeous pink smoke ring and amazing flavor) and smoked sausage (has just the right amount of spice too it!) sides- okra and mac n cheese.  We are from Oklahoma and miss the craft and care that goes into smoking and creating amazing BBQ but we don't have to miss it anymore!

The brisket and chicken are also above average. The sides are extremely good at least most of them.

The owners regularly come out to check on tables. All of the staff is attentive, kind, and welcoming.

We ordered the D's Delicious Sampler ($50) with Bacon Potato Salad and Loaded Mash for the sides. \n\nThe service was pretty good. The food came very quickly and we didn't wait long at all (maybe ~10 minutes, give or take a few). We ordered that party pack because it looked like it'd give us a good taste of what Rollin Smoke BBQ had to offer, and it didn't disappoint. \n\nI can't say I'm a expert at eating BBQ (with only Lucille's and Phil's for comparison), but my family and I were very pleased with the St. Louis spare ribs. The meat was very tender and came right off the bone. The sauce, which we got on the sides, were pretty decent. Out of the possible 4, one of the best ones were the Sweet Country Girl and Mama's Sweet D-Licious; they weren't like your run-of-the-mill BBQ sauce. The Spicy sauce and the vinegar were mediocre, so we didn't get too much of those. The sides were very good too, though we never had the chance to finish them.\n\nFor a family of 4 (parents and two 18+ men), I was surprised that the $50 party pack filled all of us up, even to where we couldn't finish the sides. And I daresay we had quite an appetite already. \n\nIf you're visiting Vegas and you haven't come here, I recommend coming at least once to see what it has to offer!"

The sauce was good (on the thin side as you'd expect for this style) with just a hint of sweet. \n\nI had the duo plate with brisket, hot link and jalape\u00f1o coleslaw.  The brisket was good, flavor and smoke wise.  The hot link was the worst I've ever had, it had so much connective tissue that I couldn't chew it and ended up looking like the clown with the never ending scarf being pulled out of my mouth (eeewwww, and not attractive, right???),  The coleslaw was fairly flavorless; as I would eat it the heat would gradually build but nothing other than that.\n\nHusband had the pit special; brisket, pulled pork, spare ribs, hot link, hush puppies, mac & cheese, and collard greens.  He agreed with my assessment on the brisket and the hot link.  He liked the hush puppies but felt the mac & cheese and the collard greens were WAY over cooked and lacking flavor.\n\nSister had the pulled piggy with hush puppies.

I'd suggest people doing this so you can try a little of everything.\n       - Authentic BBQ - Walking in, you can smell this place knows how to BBQ. They have smokers in the back. That's how you know they're the real deal.\n       - Hole in the Wall - The location is located on Highland Drive. Yep, it's the same seedy highland drive with all the strip joints.\n**Ordered**\n       - Pulled Pork - I've had a lot of pulled pork in my day, but nothing as tender and mouth watering as this. It's a must order.\n       - Brisket - Not like the dry briskets you'll get elsewhere. Their brisket is tender and flavorful.\n       - Beef Rib, Baby Back - Very meaty. Like I mean, TONS of meat on this bone. However, it's not really fall off the bone.\n       - Baby Back and Spare Ribs - The flavor of their rub and BBQ sauce is delicious, but the meat wasn't too tender.\n       - Catfish - Deep fried to perfection, but lacking in spices I'd say.\n       - Bacon Potato Salad - If you like potato salad, adding sweet sweet bacon to it is a no brainer.\n       - Corn Bread - Moist and hot out of the oven. You can't go wrong with corn bread.\n\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you like BBQ. The brisket and pulled pork were my favorites."

Bland potato salad with bacon, still bland potato salad.  The rib tips had to be a day or two old. The beef ribs were way over cooked. And the sauce exploding on my husband's shirt was the icing on the cake.\n\nThe 5 stars are for the chef offering to fix the situation and giving us fresh food.

It's a small little shack that serves great barbecue.\n\nI haven't had much barbecue out here and was skeptical of how good barbecue could be, but yes, there is good barbecue in Las Vegas.\n\nI've only been twice and both times I got their duo plate.\n\nWith these plates you get the option to choose from: Brisket, hot links, spare ribs, 1/4 chicken, and pork.\n\nI got the brisket and hot link.\n\nThe brisket is very juicy and you can see the beautiful smoke ring around the edge of the meat. \n\nThe hot link has a nice snap to it and is definitely one of my favourite parts of the meal. \n\nAlong with the meat you get an option of a side and I've gotten the mac n cheese and the potato salad.\n\nThe mac n cheese was alright, nothing too special, but I do love their potato salad. It's creamy and the potatoes are still firm. It's a nice refreshing taste when eaten with the rest of the meal.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick lunch or just in the mood for some barbecue!"

            "review": "Went there on January 20, 2015.  Been to Vegas many, many times.  We stay on the strip and pretty much always eat in the many restaurants/hotels on it. A few months before this trip saw Rollin Smoke on TV on one of the many food shows. I \"adore\", appreciate, and seek out authentic BBQ joints. The real stuff is not easy to find. Well this is it! The place is a dive and small. There were 3 of us and finding a table, even though they were busy with diners and take out orders, was easy. The various sides we had were good. The proof though is in the meats and it did not disappoint. The pulled pork, chicken, spare ribs, brisket and beef ribs were outstanding. They do not overload their rub with salt like way too many other places do. That potentially does not only tend to dry out the meat, but it overwhelms the flavor of it. Here it's perfect balance. Most BBQ places do not offer beef ribs. If you've never had one it's a must. These are not the beef ribs you might see in your grocery store's meat case. Those hardly have any meat on them before cooking, let alone after. These are short ribs. Yes, these you find in your grocery, but they are cut into short pieces for slow cooking and braising. I have never seen them in the case in full rack. I have a home smoker and I get them from my grocer and ask for the pack that they then get out of the cooler for me. These contain the full four rib rack.  \"Short\" has to do with where it comes from on the cow, not the length. But because we always see them cut up, its easy to make that connection.  Matter of fact, while not quite Fred Flinstone's bronto ribs that tips his car over, they're the closest thing to it.  They are 8\" - 10\" long and loaded with meat. While a slab of spare ribs stay in a smoker for about 4 hours, beef ribs have so much meat they are in there for 8+ hours. So next time in Vegas, take a cab or your rental car and go here.  We try to get to Vegas once or twice a year and now this will be added as one of our \"must\" eating places on every trip.  From Rollin Smoke to Caesar's Bacchanal buffet!"

Yet I guarantee once you've discovered this place off the map that the tourists have you'll never forget where it is.\n\nPeople have meals they remember.  People have meal they never forget.  But very rarely do people have meals they have to ask themselves if it really happened.  No food should be allowed to taste this good.  They really shouldn't.  Because all it does is make all the other bbq feel bad, feel ashamed for their inferiority and their audacity to put themselves into the same class of eats as Rollin Smoke.  \n\nEverything here is excellent--from their ribs to their sides, from the service to their decor.  It's like walking into everybody's idea of the perfect bbq joint and finding out you never have to leave... and that maybe you never should lest it vanish like the magical culinary paradise it really is."

I was kinda bored waiting in line for ten minutes, but after seeing others eating the food as I waited, I knew the wait would be worth it. One thing in particular caught my eye. I spotted it from across the room and knew we were meant for each other.\n\nI ordered the outlaw burger, which was both inexpensive and amazing. This was easily one of the biggest burgers I have ever eaten. It has beef and brisket, onion straws, slaw and more on it. It towers over lesser burgers with a majestic stature that ensures you will be in mind blowing pain after eating this thing all in one sitting, which I of course did. The burger came with tasty waffle fries for around $9.\n\nI so wish this place opened by me in NC, although if it did, I'd be 500lbs. I will return when I hit up Vegas again."

            "review": "Here's the deal. For a while, I've been searching for authentic BBQ here in the city. Chains restaurants like Dave's and Lucille's are great but missing more of that southern down home feel. Enter Rollin Smoke, located in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip, this small eatery is does everything right.\n\nWe got here around the lunch rush, and had to wait in a small line to order. The host/cashier was Dusty I believe, friendly guy, and he was quick and attentive. Because the staff is well prepared, the food was out within 10 minutes, very quick for a BBQ establishment, and it shows great preparation.\n\nI ordered the Pit Special, and for 20 bucks you get a pick of 4 meats, 3 sides and a drink. That's enough food for 2 meals or to share. I ordered a piece of the catfish on the side, which was very good as well. Catfish is hard to perfect because you have to cook it through but not over cook it. I'm willing to attest that the catfish is about as legit as it gets.\n\nThe meat itself was fantastic, the ribs were tender but not greasy. It was nice and smoky with a good texture. Someone on here said the ribs weren't \"fall off the bone\", which  is correct. That's not to say it's tough, because it's not. Being smoked they way they are, they aren't greasy, they pull off the bone with very little effort. That's better than greasy, mushy \"fall off the bone\" people talk about when they use that phrase.\n\n\nThe sides were fantastic. The loaded mash was pretty good, not as good as some of the garlic mash I've had, BUT, excellent in it's own right. The mac and cheese was great. I'm kind of a mac and cheese snob, and nothing is as good as my moms homemade, but this was better than most BBQ/Southern restaurants. My one and only complaint was that the food could have been a bit warmer. That's it. \n\nFor not much money you can eat like a king. Fast friendly staff, and great food makes this hidden gem a winner in my eyes."

Location - WTF, I felt like I was driving to one of those back alley strip joints or toward that Erotic Museum.  However, I must say, driving there from the 15 Freeway was very easy!  Just in a very dingy area is all.\n\nb.  Size - They must have increased size,  as I was expecting a really small place with like three tables and they seemed to have expanded next door with some bench like tables to sit good size parties.  I would say though, that the max they can have in this place is like 9-10 parties of various size.\n\nc.  Menu - Pretty darn awesome if you ask me.  Simple to order and if you like meats you can make your own combo from the duo, trio or the Pit Special with a bunch of different meats. They even have large party size orders on the menu.  The brisket was great, the beef ribs darn good. I always order baby back pork ribs so these beef ribs were the right size and very tasty.  I loved the hot links and I did not care so much for the pulled pork, a bit dry if you ask me.  \n\nd.  Hot Sauce - On the table were two types of sauces, and neither was too hot.  I did use quite a bit on the pulled pork. I generally like a hot sauce. I did not ask them, and I wonder if they have it.\n\ne.  Friendly - The owners and workers here are all very friendly, ask about their food and they want you to enjoy your experience.  That is such a cool added touch!\n\nf.  Ordering, drinking and etc - You order at the front and pay, but they bring the food to you.  The soda fountain and the ice tea area are in a small and tight area, so if it is busy, it will be tough to get to. \n\ng. Leftovers - They plenty of serve yourself plastics for any leftovers you have.\n\nh.  The sides - Plenty of sides.  The potato salad was awesome. The beans were great, the corn nuggets were totally cool.  These were the only sides we had.\n\nResults - Awesome finger licking food, great pricing and great service.  Loved it better than Famous Dave's and Lucille's. GK says check it out."

The location is a bit of a hike from my home in Henderson, but not too far from work (lucky me!). \n\nWe've now ordered twice since it was such a hit the first time. We ordered the Super Sampler which was definitely the right amount of meat for 8-10 people. It looks like a lot of food, but nobody will be able to resist seconds. Six pints of sides will not go far if choosing six different sides. I would suggest choosing three different items instead of six to make sure there is enough to go around.\n\nThe MEAT. You come here for the meat because it is the best BBQ meat you'll have the pleasure of putting in your mouth. All of the meats are obviously smoked and they do it to perfection. The flavor is really sealed into the meats. The ribs fall off the bone, chicken and pork are tender, and the sausage packs a nice heat.\n\nI have enjoyed almost all of the sides as well. My favorites have been the Collard Greens (with brisket of course), Macaroni and Cheese, and Baked Beans. The only side that wasn't awesome was the Loaded Mash. Maybe my taste buds were off this day, but it tasted instant. \n\nIf you haven't been here then you are missing out on great BBQ."

Either they're great at ribs, or great at pork, or great at brisket. But for whatever reason it's really hard for any barbecue place to be great across the board.\n\nWell, stop the press. Because Rollin Smoke just raised the bar.\n\nEvery meat that comes out of the smoker is perfectly done. The ribs are served dry - the melted fat of the meat captures the hickory smoke and the dry rub is as good as they get. The pulled pork is great. The brisket is worth going out of your way for - and I'm somebody who generally isn't a huge brisket fan. The hot link has a nice slow burn to it.\n\nThe sauces served alongside the meat complement it well - but they aren't necessary. The Carolina vinegar sauce pairs best with the pulled pork - especially with a little slaw on top.\n\nTheir sides are impeccable too. Just really flawless.\n\nPortions are huge too. I'll order a 3-meat combo here at lunch and gnaw on it for another full meal and a half.\n\nI just can't say enough good things about this place. It makes me happy even just Yelping about it."

Rollinsmoke, was the best BBQ ribs my gang and I have had outside of Hawaii.  From the generous portions to the fall off the bone, meaty beef ribs...It was ONO(Hawaiian for DELICIOUS).  Anyplace with an AYCE option always attracts Hawaii Folk...But, lemme tell you that with the generous portions;I could hardly get past the first plate.  However, there's always room for dessert!  The cobbler with ice cream did not disappoint!  YUMMY!  Looking for Rollinsmoke was a lil challenge from the highway...blink and you may miss it.  Small on outside;big on inside...With seating inside and out;there was plenty of room to accommodate my group of twelve and then some.  Our group also included 4 kids(they have a kid's menu)this place is very family friendly.  In or going to Vegas? Check this place out!  I know my friends and I will!  Until next time, Aloha and Mahalo"

Plastic forks and knives, Styrofoam and paper plates.\n\nThe smell of smoke was pretty amazing. I was floating in like this place was the pied piper.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple like it should be. \n\nThe owner was taking the food order. Its kind of different. You pay first and wait for a runner to bring out your food. The owners are very nice people and really care about their food.\n\nI ordered The Biggin, its a sandwich with pork, brisket, and hot links and it was friggin delicious. There's no easy way to eat this monster. You have to dig in and understand things are gonna get messy.\n\nOne boy ordered the catfish po boy. Yes its not BBQ but he loved it and they did make it perfect.\n\nAnother ordered the Brisket Dog. I didn't know it was on a sesame seed bun which he was allergic to. They made it over at no charge and put it on a hamburger bun. The sandwich was as big as his head! I was entertained just watching him trying to eat this behemoth! Its a good thing they have rolls of paper towels on the tables because this kid needed a whole roll. He loved it too.\n \nI will definitely be back again!\n\noh and guys, if you sneak there without your wife or GF, you will be caught because you walk out of this place smelling like smoke!"

From the main meats down to the sides.  I mean, I wish I could in some sense describe my experience here so that it even comes close to the actual event.... \n\nI ordered a rib basket, and for $14.99 I got a beef rib, pork ribs, and a half rack baby back rib.  Now that may not sound like much, but the ribs are HUGE.  The beef rib was the largest I've ever seen.  The meat was tender, juicy, and just shaved off the bone with my plastic fork.  The pork ribs were good, more dense as it should be but still juicy, flavorful meat.  And I can tell you I've never had a baby back rib that even came close to this baby back rib.  \n\nOnto the sides.  I've never had a jalapeno slaw that came close to this one, a fantastic blend of spice and sweet, not soppy wet and not dry either.  Mash potatoes with melted cheddar and chives!  Holy crap.  The potato salad was fantastic.  Now I have one rule about BBQ is that I ALWAYS have room for the banana pudding.  I'm sorry to say I broke my rule, so I am not going to be able to inform on the banana pudding.\n\nOn my next trip to Vegas, you better believe this will be on my list to return to.  Maybe twice :)  And this says something, because the BBQ place is not a walk from the strip, it's a definite taxi ride, but if you are a fan of the show, Counts Kustoms is a little less than a mile walking distance from this place, up the same road so you may kill two birds with one stone."

Had I have known it would have been that long of a wait time, I would have left. The order taker was not very friendly and did not make a good first impression. She seemed rushed and annoyed that she was taking orders, even though I already knew what I wanted and only asked one question about the pies. \n\nAfter waiting an hour in a half for our food, I was really hoping for amazing barbecue. In fact, I was so hungry at that point, I didn't think I could tell the difference. Anything seemed like it would have been yummy. But, I was wrong. I could definitely tell that the food was just okay. Definitely NOT worth an hour in a half wait. \n\nRibs were good, hot links were good, but the chicken, pulled pork, and chopped brisket were bland. I had to drown it in sauce to make it worth eating. And even drowning it in the sauces (I tried all the sauces), it still did not help the flavor get any better. The baked beans were average, the corn nuggets - I did like and would say is above average. The coleslaw was mehhhh. Not impressed. \n\nOne of the order takers was 'smart mouthing' customers who complained about the wait on their food. i was appalled. I kept my mouth shut. But, customer after customer steamed with frustration after their wait time pushed way pass 45 minutes, then an hour, then an hour in a  half. What was more frustrating is the order takers were still quoted a 25 minute wait on food, when they knew full well the kitchen was backed up to over an hour. I have no idea how this place got such stellar reviews and no one mentioned the crazy wait.  \n\nI love BBQ and for the past few days I had been going to Famous Dave's. After this ridiculous wait at Rollin Smoke Barbeque, I'd rather go to Famous Daves. The food at Famous Dave's is just as good. In fact, what I ordered there was quite possibly a tad bit better. The atmosphere, service, sauces, and speed of food trumps Rollin Smoke Barbeque any day! \n\nAt Famous Dave's, the wait was only 15 minutes for our feast for 6 people. In my opinion, a 15 minute wait for a feast of 6 is totally worth it. Plus, there was so much food we had left overs. The feast for 6 comes out to be $11 a person (if you have 6 people) and was so well worth every penny and every bite."

Service was also attentive. Both Lizelle and Karina were making rounds, cleaning up spills on floors, and checking that everyone was doing well. \n\nSeating was on picnic tables which I thought was pretty cool.  Different sauces to try and generous if you're taking some to go too. The sweet sauce is like honey mustard, but even their default BBQ sauce is a safe bet for extra flavor. To go boxes and plates are on the counter next to cutlery. It's pretty  easy to get what you need.\n\nI noticed their prices increased since last time I was here which was pretty disappointing though (minus a star) . BBQ is always gonna be a bit pricey, but is it worth it? I say, \"try it.\" Trio plate is a safe bet, and for me, it was good for two people. Ribs, sliced brisket, and pork, a side, and a slice of white bread for $17.99.

I found this brisket to be pretty good, tender & flavorful, I just prefer mine from \"The Point\"\nThe Spareribs had a great flavor, the right 'bite', you do not want fall off the bone, many may think that, but the best have a bit of bite, but are also tender.  These were so.\nThe service was great, the guy that took my order was patient, he may be the owner, not sure, but worked with me on my order to make sure I got want I wanted.

They are located in an almost industrial center part of town, and there's not a whole lot of parking, especially when they are busy.  They are right down the street from our go to Tattoo shop, so they are really convenient for us to grab a to go order when someone's tattoo is going to take all day.  They also have two dining areas and seating outside too if you'd rather eat in. \n\nThe portions are huge; my boyfriend and I can share one of their two or three meat platters easily.  On this most recent visit we ordered two of the three meat platters.  One for us to share, and one for the two teenage boys to share.  For under $40, all four of us were completely stuffed and we still had leftovers.   For our platter we had ribs, pork and brisket with the bacon potato salad and banana pudding.  The ribs were falling off the bone, the pork was flavorful and juicy and the brisket was really tender.  I grabbed a few extra containers of their sauce, but we didn't need it because the meats were great on their own.  The service is excellent even when they are busy.  I'll be honest, we're heading back to Vegas at the end of the month, and I think Rollin Smoke might be one of the things I'm looking forward to the most!"

The inside setup of the restaurant is a little bit awkward. The fountain drinks are in a closet. The person taking your order in behind a huge podium - you can barely see them.  The bathroom is well....... sad. The bathroom is nearly like a gas station's - useful but don't touch anything.  The paper towel dispenser fell off the wall, but nobody put a roll of towels on the counter so you can dry your hands off. They have rolls of towels on every table - just not in the bathroom.  Looks like the owner spent way more money on the mural in the 2nd dining area than in the rest of the place."

My husband and I are foodies and love a good meal, weather it's fine dining or a hole in the wall. I hate paying for a meal that I could've made myself so it was hard to find a restaurant that was worth trying. The food here blew my mind. I ordered the duo plate where I could pick two meats and a side. I picked ribs and pork with a side of fried corn balls. My husband ordered the brisket meatloaf which came with onion rings on top and mashed potatoes. Every single food item, down to the pickles, was absolutely amazing. We didn't leave a single crumb on our plate. We also had the banana pudding that one of the chefs so nicely gave us on the house, just to be nice. He told us that there are several chefs, each one specializing in their own meat. How cool is that? No wonder it was all good. My husband hasn't stopped talking about our meal so we're going back tonight for more, I want to try the peach cobbler! Shout out to Matt at the register for helping us decide what to order. All the employees were so nice and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun. When we pulled up, our Uber driver wished us luck. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere and looks sketchy but it's really not. If you pull up and think of leaving, give it a shot. It's the best BBQ you'll ever have."

I shouldn't have done that because the portions are BIG! and you are not allowed to order more unless you finish your plate! The food was delicious but there was a lot! \n\nI started with the ribs that were easy to come off the bone and had a nice sauce to it. I loved the breaded catfish because the tarter sauce had a nice lemony taste to it. Bacon potato salad which also had a bit of chives sprinkled on the top. I like my potato salad chunky and not too creamy so it was perfect! \n\nThe dessert was a hit and miss the black berry cobbler looked murky but I tried it and I wasn't too impressed. It tasted a little sour for me.  I liked that banana pudding better.  \n\nSome advice is to buy a la carte if you know that you can't eat a lot. I felt uncomfortable after the meal because I over ate. If I was to do it all over again I would get the catfish especially , potato salad and the banana pudding. Those were my standouts out of everything I ate. \n\nI liked that there wasn't really a wait and we were served right away! The service was wonderful ! They kept  checking on us to see if we needed anything which was awesome!"

When you walk in, there's a large menu on the wall and after you place your order, you can go sit down and they'll bring the food to you. The menu is somewhat large and features classics like pulled pork sandwiches and meat combo plates. They've also got some not-so-usual options like the gigantic Outlaw Burger, Chicken 'n Waffles and even an all you can eat option. \n\nI usually order a two meat combo with brisket and hot link. Most places seem to serve a packaged hot link and just toss it in sauce. While I have no idea whether there's is or not, it's one of the better ones I've had. The sausage is flavorful with a great snap and they don't douse it in sauce. Since I'm a fan of spicy food, I like that there's has a little kick to it as well. And there's a reason I can't stay away from the brisket either. It's extremely tender, flavor is great and it's not overly smoky. Again, even though I really like their sauce, they don't douse the meat in it which is a huge plus. You have to try the sauce though, it's slightly sweet but has a mild heat...really tasty.\n\nIf you're into dessert, they have a few options there too. We've used the Yelp check-in for a free mini dessert a few times and always get the peach cobbler. My wife is a peach cobbler fanatic and this is her favorite in town. I've heard good things about the banana pudding though and I'll be getting that next time.\n\nThis a solid 4.5 stars for me and only because I've had inconsistent plate sizes. One time I got a combo plate that had so much meat I couldn't finish it, but then the two other times we've went, I finished mine and starting picking off the wifeys. Not a huge deal but it's a bit irritating. Either way, Rollin Smoke serves some of the best BBQ in town and at much better prices then most of them too. Top it off with friendly service and you got a must try spot!"

They had that great balance of salty and sweet that you want.\n\nNow this place is on the small side. I was certainly grateful that we happened to come at a time that wasn't very busy.

They stated that the ice cream was Blue Bell and in fact it wasn't. I'm from Texas and know the ice cream very well, and what BBQ should taste like. I've had better ribs at chain restaurants where the meat falls off of the bone. Unfortunately this meat felt like it was fighting for its life to maintain a part of the bone. I was very disappointed to say the least. McDonald's McRib sandwich is a better BBQ choice than this restaurant and I haven't eaten at McDonald's in over 20 years."

The dining area(s) are small, but from what I could tell, most people were carrying their food to go anyway. Oh, and don't expect to find it on the strip... do some exploring and you'll find this place a little out-of-the-way.\n\nFor a barbecue place, Rollin Smoke has a decent sized menu w/ some more odd options like the baked potato, or giant burgers not usually associated. Their sauce is really good with a nice kick, and spice that adds flavor to anything from ribs to their awesome fries.\n\nTry the sides. I love how they add spice by-way-of jalapenos to macaroni, and beans. \n\nIs it the best I've had? No, but its close."

Not convenient to a lot of different traffic, but good for the workers all along Highland Dr. The restaurant is extremely casual with picnic tables inside and outside. There was an additional room with seating off to the side, but I did not peek in. \n\nService:  the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Chef Will was awesome! He noticed I was staring at the menu for a very long time, so he asked if it was my first time here. Then he proceeded to go through the menu with me, and even let me taste a few things before ordering. What great customer service!!!!!!\n\nFood: I really wish I could give the food a higher rating, but it was just not as good as I hoped. The corn nuggets were delicious!  The pulled pork and beef ribs were pretty good too. But the jalape\u00f1o cole slaw tasted more like black pepper cole slaw. The bacon potato salad was good, but too many onions for me. The biggest problem was I got my food to go and there wasn't any BBQ sauce in my bag. Not sure if that's standard and you have to ask for some or they just forgot it. Either way, it just wasn't BBQ without the sauce. \n\nOverall:  amazing customer service, and good food, by not great. I'd come back with friends, but I'd try something different next time."

There are also plenty of places to sit, including tables outside.  But, since I came during the Las Vegas summer, there was no way I was sitting outside.\n\nI was having trouble deciding between the Outlaw Burger and the 2 meat duo with pork and brisket.  The guy that was helping me suggested the meatloaf, which is made up of both brisket and pork and smoked.  It comes with potatoes on the bottom and BBQ sauce and fried onions on the top with pickle slices and a roll on the side.  I added fried okra, because if a place has fried okra I have to try it.\n\nI was glad I took this guy's suggestion.  The slab is ENORMOUS, it easily fed me for dinner as well, and I'm a big eater.  The smoke in the meatloaf was incredible, very impressive.  I could have used more fried onions, but what dish couldn't?  I'll order more next time I eat here.  When you had a bite with the sauce and the onions, it was the perfect blend of crunch, meat and a bit of spice.\n\nThe okra was very good, but not the best I've had.  Service was fantastic, it took a bit to get my food, but they are super popular and making your food when you order.  So, it's worth waiting a few minutes.  Highly recommended, and the leftovers did great that evening with a second heating..."

We headed down stairs to the steak house and decided last minute how YUMMY BBQ would be! \nSo I YELP'd BBQ and a few places came up, one being Rollin Smoke and most others smack in the middle of the busy Saturday night strip time (no thanks)... \nWe drove about the mile yelp said, and yes it was a super dark street not a lot of cars around... and I started getting that \"I think I've seen this Law and Order episode\" about the couple that goes to the dimly light bbq place and is never seen again. \nSo we drive past and I say to my BF \"you know it is normally these off the beat path ones that are AWESOME!!! And you can't ignore the 3 GIANT smokers in the parking lot!! \nSo I say let's go!\"\n\nWhen we got in the place was quite nicely decorated and very clean, you can smell the food which made my tummy start screaming \"FEED ME\"\nThe 2 gentlemen running the BBQ place were as kind as can be! \nWe each to get the ribs and chicken combo with side of coleslaw & BBQ beans.\nThe prices were great over there and they have a bunch of things to choose from which was great!!\nSInce the place was not packed we got to sit in the room with the TV and they even let us watch what we wanted. \nOur food came out and we were shocked to see they there was enough to feed a small village in just one order! \nI don't even know the best way to describe this smoked deliciousness of ribs and chicken that hit my belly! Oh it was heaven, the chicken fell off the bone when I picked it up and the ribs were so tender! And I got the flashback of a few minutes earlier of the chef saying \"he was from the (arkansas or Alabama) and he took much pride in his smoked bbq.\" NOW if ALL bbq places would care that much!!!\n \nThey must start cooking their meats early early to get them with that much flavor. \nIn my life I only profess & save my undying love for very special things, so far only my doctor and a sushi place from LA have made it on this list, but I know I am adding \"Rollin Smoke\" to it now!!!\n\nI had my leftovers for breakfast and my grandmother had some of my chicken left, she commented it was the best she had ever had!! (and that was cold leftovers)!!!   \n\nI know it might seem sketchy when you drive up but DON'T be a fool and pass it by just for that!!!\nThis BBQ is some serious HEAVEN!!!!"

Ignore that, look over at the mobile smokers, and then step inside to a recently renovated space. The bench tables may turn some people off but they are there to encourage people to sit together. But there are smaller tables, and even a second room (it's where the BBQ Grill fish tank is) if you want a little less of a crowd. \n\nBut it's all about the food and Rollin Smoke delivers with excellent Brisket, chicken, and ribs that will make you think you're not in Vegas but in KC or Memphis. I could run long here but let's just say I spent 30 years in KC. I love BBQ. When I crave BBQ this is where I go, period. \n\nService...if they're busy it can be hit or miss. It's not upscale. It's kind of a hole in the wall. But the BBQ keeps me coming back time and time again. \n\n5 Stars - Earned over 2 years of repeatedly great experiences. Worth the cab ride from the Strip if you're visiting."

Rollin Smoke serves up a plethora of great ribs, pulled pork, brisket, chicken, hot links, burgers and much more. The Outlaw Burger is an award winner and the links are amazing. I'm a rib fanatic and love the St. Louis spareribs. They go light on the sauce and let the ribs speak for themselves. Beef ribs are huge, tender and delicious. They are also very proud of their smoked meatloaf. My girlfriend's 94 year old little Texas mama loved her catfish which was cooked perfectly. Many delicious sides. I recommend the corn nuggets. Loved them! Our host who also owns the place, Dusty, could not have been more accommodating or hospitable. I don't live in Las Vegas but whenever I am anywhere near the area I make sure to stop at Rollin Smoke. I've never been disappointed. Great BBQ right off the Las Vegas Strip! Who woulda' thunk it?"

I asked for the trio meal, with brisket, pork and baby back ribs, but they refused me.  They said they could add the baby backs to the duo meal for an extra $6.  Not wanting to get off the \"high\" of quitting my job, I relented.\n\nThis time I asked for no greens and they obliged.  When the meal came, the food was cold. (It was about 7:30pm; they close at 8:30.)  I tried not to let it get me down.  The $6 baby backs amounted to exactly two (2) bones.  And I'm not even quite sure I got the baby backs, because they were meaty and chewy (and cold), resembling St. Louis ribs (which I could have gotten at a discount).  Anyway, that's not my biggest complaint.  This time, for some reason, I found the BBQ sauce to be very spicy.  I don't recall it being spicy the first time around (otherwise, I would have marked it down).  So for those of you keeping count -- I recommend the brisket and the pork but NOT the \"baby back ribs\" -- and also, come here during lunch, when the food is presumably fresher and hotter.  Aside from that, I think I'm done here.  Not that I can afford to eat anymore, now that I'm an unemployed bum.\n\nMerry Christmas.  I'm going to kill myself."

            "review": "OK so I went to the electronics store in the same small strip mall with a friend. We decided to try out Rollin smoke. The small Asian gal that took our order did not smile, did not seem friendly, and it was only 11am so not sure why she would be so grumpy so early in the day. I had the catfish po' boy for $12.99. It comes with no sides, with nothing. The sandwich has two pieces of fried catfish, not big and not small, also lettuce, tomato and a yellow mustardy 'tartar sauce'. The fish was mushy, not sure how else to explain it. The lettuce wilty, the tomato over ripe. It also came with sliced onion. The menu does not mention the onion, had it mentioned them, I would have had them removed as I am allergic to onion. Not worth the $13. My friend had the two meat plate for $13.99. He chose the pulled pork and the chopped brisket. His also came with a side so he chose the cheesy mac n cheese. His was all good. Not a lot of meat, not sure it was worth the $13.99 but much closer to being worth the cost than the catfish sandwich was. \nSo to recap, do NOT get the fried catfish sandwich. Not worth it, and not that good. The onion taste on the wilty lettuce with mustard instead of real tartar sauce on mushy catfish.... the duo meat plate was not bad. And just deal with the grumpy order taker. As you can see from my reviews, I rarely give a 1 star rating... so listen to it. Better to go to the Big B's in Henderson or the John Mull's Road Kill Grill on Thom blvd in northwest Las Vegas."

You know it's going to be good. \n\nI must say, to my disappointment that I did not get to try as much as I should have. I had the Pull \"Piggy\" as it's called, which is pulled pork on a hoagie roll. I read some other reviews that it was pretty large and since I was coming for lunch I didn't want to over do it. My mistake. It wasn't that big at all. Simple six-inch hoagie roll stuffed with smoked pulled pork with a drizzle of their bbq sauce and some green onions. It was very stuffed, but I still wasn't full afterwards. My fiance got a sandwich as well, the beef brisket. Both were absolutely amazing. The meat is tender and packed with flavor. The bbq sauce isn't overwhelming and heavy - enough to add flavor and more moistness. \n\nAll-in-all, I cannot wait to come back to this place. They have AYCE for $25, anytime any item. Challenge accepted, soon."

Very authentic, not too smokey but just right.  The beans were nothing short of incredible.  Next time I will be trying the jalapeno cole slaw.  I certainly hope business is good for them because it is downright impossible to find reasonably priced, authentic bbq in Vegas.  Good advertising having the smokers in the parking lot or else I would never have known it was there.   Only suggestion I would make would be to add more sides such as collards, etc."

They had mentioned that they had been here before and who had helped them the last time they had come here which to our surprise happend to be one of their chefs, chef Tim. Even more surprising was the fact that he took the time to come out and acknowledge us he even said he remembered my girlfriend and her mother last time. I can say that this place has some of the best customer service that I have ever experienced. Everything was smiles and great food from beginning to end. The food was absolutely superb and I can honestly say this is my new favorite place to get BBQ. I would even go as far as saying this is the best BBQ place in las Vegas everything was amazing and definitely will be back. 5/5"

For a single person eating lunch, with a sandwich, side and a drink and you're close to $20. If you get a meat combo or such, that'll push it up even more. That being said, the stuff is good. The signs all say Alabama BBQ, not sure what that means but it's good! One caveat...when you leave this place all of your clothing will smell like smoke for the rest of the day. Sauces are good too, they have several to choose from, the house and the Carolina vinegar are my faves. They have a hot one too, that is pretty spicy.

We also had sides of mac and cheese, yams and corn nuggets.  First off, hubby loved his burger.  I had one bite and it was good, but too much like meatloaf for me both in taste and texture.  I like that they smoked the burger. We do that at home as well and there is nothing better.  Next visit hubby is getting the meatloaf he said. Something about loaded mashed potatoes.......yum.\n\nI really enjoyed the brisket, it was moist and had just the right amount of smoke infused into it.  Some of it was cut too thick for my liking and as such, didn't have that tug and pull apart you expect, but thankfully, it wasn't served drenched in sauce, that is a no-no in my book.  \n\nThe pulled pork was good, but not great. It lacked that smoky flavor but it was very moist.  I have the same problem making this at home. It is difficult to get that smoke all the way into the deepest part of the meat.  Their BBQ sauce was very nice, not too sweet or just tasting like spiced-up ketchup. The two together were nice and next time on a sandwich it is.\n\nThe chicken was also good, but my favorite for flavor was the homemade sausage. It was nice and smokey and had a great kick at the end.  I would like the grind a bit finer though.  The sides were all tasty.  You could taste the cheese in the mac and cheese and it was not greasy at all. The yams were nice and chunky and sweet but not too sweet. The corn nuggets were perfect, nice and crunchy on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside. H&J on Eastern, take some lessons from this place on how to cook these. \n\nWe shared a banana pudding for dessert and it was creamy good, but I would have liked to see some banana slices in it. The vanilla wafers were nice and soaked with pudding goodness.  I am not sure how we had room to eat it all, but we did.  We took plenty of meat home for leftovers.  \n\nWill we be back? Yes, of course.  This is by far the best BBQ we have had in Las Vegas so far.  Just wish they were closer to home."

He texted back,  \"Neither. ..\"  At the same time, William of LA messaged that he hadn't had a chance to go to Rolling Smoke Barbeque...ah...how to decide?   Shall I explore for William?  Why not? \n\nMy GPS took me down some road that I have never heard of or been on. It seemed like I was in an industrial area.  I saw a sign with the name of the restaurant clumped up with other businesses. I pulled in the driveway. There were two police cars already parked there.  I messaged William about the location. He said there are strip clubs in the area.  \"Thanks!\", I messaged back.  A little worried, I walked in anyway. \n\nThe place was about half full and I stood in line to order. The cashier, Dave, was very friendly and helpful. I decided to get the Platter which had 3 baby back ribs, 2 St. Louis spare ribs, and one beef rib.  Then I had to select a side dish. I figured that I knew what Mac and cheese was about, so I got the Corn Nuggets.  Yes, I didn't know what that was either. ..  Dave said that it's Sweet Corn,  breaded, and deep fried. Intriguing!  Let's try it!  Then, Dave give me a cup. I asked if this meal came with a free drink because I noticed that the drinks are $3 with refills.  No... I got a complimentary beverage!  Yay! Thanks Dave!  The soda dispenser is self service! !\n\nI guess I was supposed to sit down and have the meal brought to me.  The other room had a table occupied by police officers. I sat in the corner, under the television. Another option was outside seating, but it was dark and cold. I left my jacket in the car, prepared to battle some ribs. ..\n\nThe Beef Rib was on the top. I couldn't stop eating it. The moist meat fell off the bone. It was like smokey, soft, stew meat. The charred \"koge\" fat layer on the top was scrumptious! I wanted to give equal attention to the baby back ribs and the St. Louis spare ribs, but I couldn't let go of that Beef Rib. It was that good!  Later, I realized that I ate everything without sauce. There were containers on the counter, but I was so mesmerized that I stayed in my seat. I got up for a soda refill and a take out container & package which are self service along with utensils.\n\nI wasn't able to finish everything in one sitting,  so I brought it to my hotel room and had a perfect midnight snack! The only thing that might turn some customers off would be a cockroach. I saw one crawling across the wall at the entrance of the restaurant. However, I'm not going to let this get in my way of a BBQ meal.  I would go back again!"

You're wondering if a town like Las Vegas has local places that most tourists don't know exist.  If you're like me, you go to the source, Yelp, for good information, and Yelp came through in a great way.\n\nOn this date we found Rollin Smoke Barbeque, and it was a good, make that great, find.  It is a hole in the wall joint tucked into a strip mall off the beaten path, and, as of this review, it was averaging 4.5 stars after 455 Yelp reviews.  This is a very good thing, as Yelpers can be unkind and unforgiving on occasion.  Typically I look for consensus when using Yelp, and that is usually achieved after 100 or so reviews.\n\nOn our trip there were three of us arriving, my wife, my sister in law, and me.  Of the three, I was the most committed to the experience, and the other two were good sports.  After the food arrived, they were also sold.\n\nWe ordered so that we could try almost everything, as we got enough to share with each other.  We had beef ribs, pork ribs, chicken, jalapeno cole slaw, beans, potato salad, and, as its two days since we were there, I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  We also 'checked in' on Yelp, and when we did this they offered us a free desert.  We chose the blueberry cobbler.\n\nIf you are 'high maintenance' this is not a place for you.  You order like you're at Carl's Junior; stand in line, place the order, give them your name, find a seat, and they bring it out to you.  The room does not feature fancy table clothes or fine silver.  It does include a plethora of paper towels (on a roll for your immediate use), and a TV tuned to a sports channel.  In the room with us was a crew of air conditioning repair men, about ten guys, and the fact that they were there, locals, helped me know that this not a tourist spot, but a local's place.\n\nThe $40 worth of food that we ordered literally arrived in about four minutes.  It is important to note that we had attempted to avoid any kind of lunch rush, arriving before the lunch hour.  There were probably 10 other people already there, and I suspect that the lunch hour features a lengthy line.\n\nRegrets?  Yes, just one.  I wanted to taste one of their links, but I didn't get the chance, but next time, and there will be a next time, I'll get one.  Las Vegas is many things, and there are a lot of really great places to eat, and, as in all big towns, there are some great locations off The Strip that you've got to find, and Rollin Smoke Barbeque is on that list."

So, when I moved to Las Vegas, I just about gave up on finding anything near what we in the South call \"BBQ.\" Other places claim to have BBQ (ahem, Famous Dave's) but they DO NOT. Rollin Smoke is heaven on a spit. They know what they are doing and they do it well. If you are super hungry and want something that will hit the spot, go to Rollin Smoke. These guys are from the Carolinas (sorry, can't remember if it's North or South, apologies), and they do BBQ well. I won't go into whether this is dry rubbed or not because if you are from Las Vegas, you won't even know what I'm talking about anyway. Just go there if you want great BBQ here. You'll love it. \n\nAlso, for those folks who complain about Rollin Smoke running out BBQ, I have to remind folks who don't know that real BBQ takes time. Lots of time. Smoking is a dedicated process, and if this restaurant runs out of meat, they run out of meat. They can't magically smoke more in 30 minutes or less. So, get there early so you can get what you want. My kids had the pork sandwich and it was huge and they ate it all. The bacon potato salad is heaven. My husband had the 3 meat Brisket Dog, and loved it. I had the Smoked Meatloaf, and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I had plenty of leftovers for my husband and I to share. We saw (and were frightened of) the Outlaw Burger, as it was easily a foot tall. So, again, please note: Bring Your Appetite. \n\nThis is a \"get in line and order\" place, with seating in three different rooms. We loved sitting in the room with the \"Tanked\" fish tank that used to be their original smoker."

We missed it the first time around, it's by a Diamonds Cabaret Strip club and when we pulled in the store front is dark so it looks even closed. You'll see large BBQ smokers in the parkinglot so you know you're in the right place. It's open late-ish during the week, and 1:30 am during Fridays and Saturdays! \n\nBobby, Misti, and Mamie said something about grabbing some food to eat here after a UYE and somehow it struck a cord with everyone that BBQ sounds amazing and talk was rumbling about hunger that the rest of us decided to sort've crash on their idea. \n\nThe BF and I shared two dishes, made both a combo (drink and 1 side) -\n\nSmoked meatloaf  was awesome. The BF says one of the best he's had. It's definitely great flavor and is a different style of meatloaf being smoked, then basted in some of the sauce and topped with crispy onion rings. It was on a bed of pretty good red skin mashed potatoes. If you love meatloaf, this is something to try. \n\nBeef ribs are normally something we skip over, but seeing as they looked good and people were actually saying they were quality I decided we should give it a go. It was meaty, juicy and tender which is rarely achieved. I have to compare it to my holy grail of Phils in SD, and while it doesn't have that cracktastic crisp outside to moist (haha CHRISTIE O. ) inside, the quality is definitely there and satisfies that want for a good beef rib. So many places don't even serve it, just because of how hard it is to cook right. These were solid. \n\nOur sides were also solid. The baked BBQ beans had pulled pork pieces in it and was very good and hearty. Potato salad is the red skin potato style mayo (no mustard) style and had crispy bacon bits and green onions on top. I like all kinds of potato salad and this was good.There was a little bread piece on the basket which was kinda stale and dry which was the only hiccup.  They have one kind of BBQ sauce and it's on the zesty and a tad spicy side which I enjoyed it a lot. \n\nI really wanted to try a dessert, but we already had the major meat \"itis\". Maybe one day I will come back and eat something \"lighter\", you know, like a sandwich chaulk full of meat. \n\nIt's a order up type of place at the counter and serve yourself drinks out of the beverage closet (it'll make sense once you're there). The staff was friendly and made sure to check on us. \n\n Apparently the owners are Arkansas folks and while that is a \"fringe\" state that normally people don't think about slanggin' the 'que, it takes on influence from the best ideas of the rivalry states, really.\n\n I definitely think even from this first visit, this place raises the bar on BBQ offerings in this town. We will be back, probably really soon."

The potato salad had bacon sprinkled on top, would have preferred that the bacon be mixed in. The beans were delish. The peach cobbler was inedible. I think I found 1/2 of a peach slice and the rest was a mixture of soggy dough. I spent $34 for my meal, which is outrageous given that I threw the cobbler away. At Dinosaur, the ribs are excellent and a 1/2 slab, cornbread and two sides is less than $20 and believe me, you'll leave with a smile on your face."

I have to say, we were impressed!\n\nWith the help of the perky and oh so passionate cashier, we ordered the Pit Special 5 Meat 3 Sides for 27.99.

It was her first time, so she spent a few minutes to look at the wall-sized menu. I also found myself staring and trying to decide what to get. I wasn't feeling up to tackling a big portion today, so I didn't get the outstanding Outlaw Burger again. Instead, I went with the Catfish Po Boy ($8.99) and a dessert of Country Berry Cobbler (free with purchase of sandwich and Yelp check-in).\n\nI spent some time nibbling on my friend's Dad's Favorite, which is actually a sandwich (and thus qualifies for the dessert, although we didn't know it at the time). The brisket, pork, and hot links were all pretty tasty, although my friend could have done without the hot links because she is even more heat-averse than I am. She definitely went for a soda refill at least once.\n\nMy po boy took upwards of 10 minutes longer to come out, which I felt was a good sign. It was worth it for that catfish. It was quite moist and flaky, properly seasoned, and lightly crunchy on the outside. The catfish was definitely the star. No complaints about the spicy and tartar sauces, which I ended up spreading all over the sandwich. Lettuce was fine, lemon was helpful, and tomato brought a nice lightness. Only thing I would have liked is if the bread was buttered or something. The bread was merely toasted, and it actually looked a bit burnt, but thankfully had none of that off-putting flavor.\n\nThe country berry cobbler actually came out at the same time as the po boy. Unfortunately, by the time I was ready for dessert, the whipped cream had died. I actually had the peach cobbler last time, and while I would probably take the peach if forced to choose one, the berry cobbler is also very good and has enough of a tartness to offset the sweetness. It was also still warm, since it was served in a foam bowl, but I'm thinking that it contributed to the downfall of the whipped cream. I'll have to remember to try to ask for a delayed dessert presentation if I do this again.\n\nI noticed that at least 3 tables had people doing the AYCE, and that made me wish that I hadn't had lunch today. I definitely want to try the all you can eat option some time. I enjoy that sort of thing, and I would finally be able to get my hands on all of their meats at once. Maybe I'll be ready to bump it up to 5 stars on that day, but until then, I still highly recommend Rollin Smoke Barbeque to all lovers of meat - and catfish."

This is TRUE bbq, you can tell they don't just slather bbq sauce on the meat and call it barbecued. You can taste the smokiness in the meat and it's unbelievably tender. There were 3 of us and we got the all you can eat so we were able to try a bunch of items on the menu:  chicken, brisket, pulled pork, hot links, spare ribs, baby back ribs, beef ribs, mac n cheese, coleslaw, fried okra, banana pudding, berry cobbler, and a root beer float.\n\nThe highlights were definitely the ribs. The spare ribs and baby backs were my FAVORITE things we tried. Spare ribs had a bit more kick and spice, and the baby backs were juicier and fattier (in a delicious, perfect way). The beef rib was also delicious - not to mention the biggest rib I've ever seen - but very rich and filling. The coleslaw was excellent to cut the richness, sweetness, and smokiness of the meal, and the fried okra was simple and perfect. Mac n cheese was also great (I totally judge a bbq place on hthe quality of their mac n cheese... ie Big Ern's at Container Park sucks). Brisket wasn't thrilling, but I admit I like my brisket with a little fat on it and this was quite lean.\n\nThe prices are insanely good, cheaper than Famous Daves or Lucilles, and the food is better! We got AYCE but would've been fine sharing the Pit Special, Rib Platter, & adding a couple beef ribs - which is basically exactly what we ordered, except we paid more because we chose AYCE and they added extra to the platter, which we didn't need and had quite a bit leftover. Also the service is awesome, they genuinely care if you're enjoying the food. The entire experience was great!  I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu, I have my eye on the collard greens, loaded mash potatoes, and \"bbq parfait!\""

While the flavors are good it was barely lukewarm. And why would you chop up the brisket? More like scraps to me. All jokes aside.  The menu did indicate it is served chopped unless otherwise requested. Again, who notices that? Shouldn't it just be mentioned when you order upfront? I personally think they just want to get rid of their scraps as obviously captured in my photo.\n\nThe sides are pretty sorry. The waffle fries is nothing more than criss cross fries. Cheesy mac and cheese was not only cold but the worst I had. The yams is more of a dessert.\n\nTip: Ask for their special spicy sauce. It is so damn good! Skip the regular bbq sauce and vinegar out in the open."

The meat was moist and yet had a nice crust. I loved the vinegar based sauce that went well with the wonderfully cooked meats. \n\nMy husband had. The three rib combo, and the meat was tender. Not exactly falling off the bone, but came off the bone cleanly, which I prefer. \n\nThe portions were ample and I would definitely return."

The chopped variety has way too much in the way of questionable ingredients like grizzle and fat, even some bones.\n\nTheir barbecue is so good that it's hard to understand why they have opted not to serve sliced brisket sandwich. This would be a huge improvement and worth at least one more star.\n\nUPDATE: Decided to head back to Rollin Smoke for some BBQ on a weeknight.  Got there around 8:10 pm on a Thursday night and they were CLOSED! \n\nCLOSED? at 8 pm?  WTH?  This is VEGAS, not Arkansas.  Dang hillbillies. \n\nOne star demotion for lack of awareness of their market."

We ordered the brisket pulled, ribs, and baked beans with a side of corn bread. Often times with BBQ the meat can be cold or be tough because it has been sitting for a while; this was not the case. It was absolutely finger lickin' delicious.  The ribs are incredible don't  waste your time beating around the bush go for the gold and this ribs are it. I recommend the Sweet Carolina BBQ Sauce, it was my favorite. The corn bread is light like and angel cake texture almost, its surprisingly scrumptious it really soaks ups the other foods well.

The sides we got were the waffle fries, loaded mash, and bbq beans. The waffle fries were tasty and seasoned well with a nice, crisp exterior. The loaded mash isn't worth it, they tasted like instant mash potatoes which it probably was. Also the baked beans weren't that great either. Lastly, usually if the meat isn't great the sauce makes up for it but not this time. I did like that there were a variety of sauces to choose from but they weren't that great and some of them kind of tasted similar."

But then again, I rarely find myself driving on Highland Drive, which mainly seems to be a business district with strip clubs. Anyway, I'll try to keep it short and sweet. \n\nThis place is all about the sides, I absolutely love them! I secretly think they are even better than the meat, LOL! My favorites so far are:\n\nCheesy Mac N Cheese - very creamy cheese sauce, and they top it off with even more (shredded) cheese!\nCorn Bread - always hot and fresh! I love how they put a good amount of butter on them and are not dry! \nCorn Nuggets - one of the employees suggested that we try this, and I'm glad we did. Creamy corn on the inside. Crispy goodness on the  outside. Great with ketchup, A MUST TRY!\nKicken Beans - I don't eat beans (unless they are soybeans), but my husband and friends have said that this was delicious. \n\nThe one side I was not crazy about were the waffle fries. They were soggy and cold the one time I had ordered them. \n\nOK, OK, the meats are pretty good too. My husband and I shared The Pit Special and I did like the brisket and pulled pork. Both were juicy, tasty, and cooked perfectly. Their barbecue sauce is good, but a bit tangy. I still say it's all about the sides! :P The employees are very friendly. They walk about asking if you enjoy the food and if you are happy. Drinks, utensils, condiments and to go containers are all self-serve. \n\nSometimes they can get crazy busy, where the line is out the door. You know what they say, the hole in the wall places are the best! I'm glad we found this spot, I think they have the best barbecue in town!"

This has been bookmarked for a long time so I was glad we were going here.\n\nWe ordered on the right side where you enter and then waited at a table on the more dining room side.  I ordered the meat trio with pork, ribs, and hot link.  I also showed them my Yelp check in offer for a free pudding with a sandwich which they honored even though I didn't order a sandwich.  Since the trio is more expensive, I guess it doesn't matter.\n\nI could tell from the time we walked in that they did their own smoking.  The place is heavy with the smell of smoke.  In fact, the first thing I did when I got home was to change my shirt.\n\nThe trio of meats was OK.  The pork was lukewarm at best and was dry.  It needed their BBQ sauce.   Two of us had gotten that and both were the same so there was something not right with the heating in the kitchen.  The meat fell off the ribs and was very good.  I'm surprised I liked them as much as I did.  The hot link was also good.  As a side I got the kicken beans but there was nothing these beans were going to kick.  They were just normal baked beans with some spice.\n\nThe banana pudding was OK.  It was nothing special and I'm sure it comes from some kind of bulk make your own package.  The serve yourself soda was great.  I was really thirsty after the hike and I went back and refilled several times.\n\nI guess I sealed the deal yesterday and realized I'm really not a BBQ person.  Lunch was OK but it's nothing that I would crave nor go out of my way to get again."

We got there just before the lunch hour rush, so we were the only ones in line (I was told that is a rare occurrence). Since I hadn't been before, the super helpful cashier gave us the run down, before we decided on a platter. On the platter there was ribs, pork, chicken, brisket, and hot links, and we got sides of mashed potatoes and slaw. Everything was awesome! We left so full. I was so satisfied that I stopped for lunch again on my way out of town. Will for sure be eating here every time I'm in town."

Even as a sometime vegetarian/full time pescetarian, the smell from the car park smokers was intoxicating. \n\nOne could say the air was moist with flavors...Huh?!?! Ya had to be there. They do have moist towelettes which I grabbed (forgetting the crew I was with) for post feast clean up. \n\nThey were out of greens and the fish and okra were deep fried (will try another day) so I opted for the yams, jalape\u00f1o slaw and baked beans: the latter has some type of meat in it, tried my best to pick it out, but veggies be aware. They also had Smoked Tabasco on the table = went right into my moist jalape\u00f1o slaw! Love hot sauce :)) \n\nService was very friendly and checked on us frequently - even one of the owners! The unsweetened fresh brewed tea was delicious. Nibbled a piece of corn bread and all of the carnivores loved their bones, pulled pork, smoked meatloaf etc...Misti gave the Southern gal stamp of approval to the okra. \n\nStill offering dessert with Yelp check in and the banana pudding looked old school divine, and moist!  Can't wait to come back and try more options and bring carnivore friends. I'm sure they will appreciate the moist delicious meat! There may not be \"Sex in the Champagne Room\" next door, but there's terrific down-home eats till 1:30AM on weekends, guaranteed!!!\n\nYelp 100 Challenge\n\nEd. Note: the word \"moist\" was used in this review many times because one should never share phobias/words that creep you out etc with Yelpers and expect to remain unscathed (in a good natured way :)))"

            "review": "Like a pimp, Rollin Smoke BBQ is whoring out their entire menu for $24.99.  That's right....You ever walk into a BBQ joint and want to try everything on the menu?  Well here you can.  I wish I would have noticed that before I ordered.  Just the $28 rack of baby backs would have made it worth my while to do the all you can eat.  Smoked Meatloaf sounds awesome, and the burgers looked great too.  You can bet I will be back to try them on my next Vegas trip.  \n\nTruth be told, I should most likely give this place 4 stars, just based on what I ate.  The pulled pork was kind of a let down for me.  Not much sauce mixed in with it, I found it kind of flavorless, and not smokey at all.  However the sauce on the table added a much needed zing and saved it - 3 stars.  The brisket was better and had a nice smoke ring to it as well as a dry rub.  It was sliced in thick slices how I prefer it - 4 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#0Lk8zyIUqCEMxyYmpGMTyg\n\nThe baby back ribs were the best of the three meats that I tried.  They had a nice bark to it, but still fell off the bone.  There were plenty of meat on these ribs and it was clear they were slowly smoked and had a great hickory flavor to them.  Ribs are always the main test of BBQ for me and these baby backs clearly passed the test and are darn good - 4.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#fSy8vbKrCQuI8Sgv8I5qmA\n\nFor the sides we tried the bacon potato salad, the kicken beans, the mac 'n cheese, and some sliced pickles.  The pickles were very good and had a nice vinegary flavor to them.  It's clear they will stand out well on any of their sandwiches.  Tasted exactly like the large dill pickles you get at Disney, in case you need that for a reference.  The kicken' beans, lived up to their name and had some spice to them along with a good peppery flavor.  There were some shards of brisket added in for some smokey flavor.  I personally prefer sweeter southern baked beans, but for some reason those are hard to get outside of the south.  Bacon potato salad, could have had more bacon in it as I couldn't really find any in there.  I still enjoyed it and it had a texture of a smashed potato salad.  The clear star of the show was the mac 'n cheese.  Some of the best I've had, it's very cheesy and creamy.  I don't see myself ever coming here without getting a bowl of it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#ph5LXQhF8FkZ-8nd6jVSfw\n\nAlthough we were plenty stuffed, I noticed a free dessert with check in.  All the desserts sounded great, but we went with the banana pudding.  No matter how full you get, for some reason, you can always manage a little banana pudding.  It just kind of slides down.  Rather than vanilla wafers it was more of a swirl of vanilla crust in the pudding.  It was ok, but I think I would try another dessert next time - 3.5 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#B-ruv_7a2ibeC_2NaLAEWw\n\nI love the vibe of this place, it's clear these are men living their dream.  The toys they have to play with in the parking lot are impressive, all kinds of mobile smokers and dressed up cars and trucks with their logo painted all over it.  It's like the bat cave of BBQ.  Holy Smoke Batman....To the Rollin' Smokemobile Robin!  And just like that they are on the move to provide smokey BBQ goodness wherever hungry folk most need them.  Also make sure you visit their party room and you will find a fun pig shaped fish tank that looks like a BBQ smoker.  Look inside and rather than coral you have all kinds of smoked meats for the fish to swim with.  Hit the button and smoke even comes out of the top of the tank.  Apparently this tank was featured on Animal Planet's show - Tanked. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#QMwyRQhoijuHeKKEaQLoeA\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#VrpJ5wb8xPouU_LyfaecEw"

This restaurant is located in the dark seedy underbelly of Desert Inn & the 15, surrounded by strip clubs and industrial yards.  We actually came here one time before but it was dark and we were scared of the area so we went somewhere else.  We're fraidy cats! I'm glad we gave it a second chance.  \n\n$18.91 got us a two meat combo and an additional side of corn nuggets.  For my two meat combo I chose chicken and pork, and chose mac & cheese for my side.  The combo comes with a drink in a cute re-usable cup.  \n\nThey do have one high chair for the kiddos.  The ambiance is casual, staff is friendly, and there's more seating than you'd think from looking at the outside.  It was a little cleaner than I was expecting but not much.  \n\nThe chicken was juicy, tender, smoky, and wonderful.  The pork....oh deer sweet 8 lb. 10 oz. baby jesus that pork is somethin' else.  It will melt in your mouth.  And their house bbq sauce is perfectly sweet and tangy.  The mac & cheese is made with perfectly cooked cavatappi and swimming in runny cheesy goodness.  The corn nuggets were served hot and fresh.  \n\nNext time I wanna try the catfish, collard greens, and banana pudding!!!"

It was very quaint and felt like a 1940's family BBQ place.  Our order was taken by a charming young man of maybe 10-12 years old.  I ordered the BBQ meatloaf because that was the dish highlighted on The Travel Channel.  It was a very large portion and OK but I wouldn't order it again.  My wife ordered \"burnt tips\" the ends of BBQ brisket) which the owner said was very popular.  It was also OK but nothing to rave about.  My son (a sous chef at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas) ordered ribs which he liked.  \n\nA lady at the next table ordered a hamburger which came with an 8 inch stack of fried onions wedged into the bun by a long stick.  It was clever and looked pretty good and I overheard her say she really liked it.    \n\nThe bill was over $75 which I felt was very high for what we ordered and for a counter-service BBQ restaurant.  \n\nWe lived in the BBQ belt in NC for 30 years so we are very picky when it comes to BBQ.  Unfortunately, this place doesn't measure up.\n\nI doubt we will be back."

The chopped brisket was lean and tender with a little bit of a peppery flavor. I was happy to see they have fried okra and it was just right. The beans were tasty as well and have a peppery flavor that's kinda unique and i haven't seen that before. The tea is the real thing and goes perfectly with a BBQ meal.

I do think I have told at least 15 people about this place since our visit last Saturday.  If that doesnt say how I feel about this place, how about the leftovers that I ate for breakfast the next day.  Yes, I must say this is simply (but not simply stated) the best BBQ I have ever EVER had.\n\nDont let the location fool you...its part of its finger lickin good charm and you cant beat the smell of pure goodness when you pull into the parking lot.  When we first arrived a couple was leaving voicing that they will be back next year - as they come here every year when they visit Vegas.  I think that says alot too.\n...a must have for tourists too?!\n\nWe both ordered the sliders-both coming with 3 and you can pick what meat you want.  I had the chicken and the brisket while my man had the chicken, brisket and the hot link sliders.  He said the hot links were his favorite-IF there could even be a favorite.  All of it was totally fab.  For sides we had the waffle fries and the mac and cheese.  The waffle fries were sprinkled with a sweet and salty flavoring that I loved and I'm still craving and wont be satisfied until I have more.  The mac and cheese was super creamy.  I thought it was very good.  Alot of the times mac comes out all dry and coagulated.  Not the case here.  I could literally eat a big bowl of it and call it a day.  ***ehem But I wouldnt recommend it only because there is SO much more important things to savor.  Lets talk about the meat - yes their slogan is that they \"rub their meat\" and however you take it consider that some good lovin (hehe).  The meat is smokey and savory....meat with FLAVOR!  The sauce was perfect (not too sweet, not too thick)-and Im very picky about sauce.   The portions were so huge.  I'm sure the guy thought I was not sure what I was getting into when I ordered the 3 sliders.  I brought home 1 1/2 that was leftover and like I said I think I must have been dreaming about it all night because I did have to dig into that first thing the next morning.  As I opened the box all I could smell was the smokey heavenly goodness and I knew right then it was going to be a good day.\n\nSo yeah on Wednesday I was sat down and asked to not be mad.....hmmm yes my man went there for lunch without me.  And YES damn right I was mad.  LOL  Yes, peeps....it is JUST THAT GOOD.  I cannot wait to go back.  Well heck Ive already checked into the catering menu so I can order for my next party.  If you are looking for a winner.....this is IT.   \n\n*side note...they are closed on Sundays.  :("

Then I stumbled on Rollin Smoke on Yelp and thought, this could be it.  Now the name Rollin Smoke has a completely different connotation if you're not thinking about smoked meat, but let's not go there.\n\nLet's go to the 'cue.  What to get?  I read about smoked meatloaf, and the pictures look good, but hey, it's meatloaf.  You don't judge a barbecue place by the meatloaf.  You want brisket and you want ribs.  I was particularly interested in beef ribs, and they have them on the smoker here every day.  How about some pork ribs?  They have a rib platter with baby backs, spare ribs and a beef rib.  Add another beef rib for $6.  Sounds good, but too much for today.\n\nThe beef rib was just what I was looking for.  Thick and meaty, dark with smoke on the outside, and juicy and fork tender inside.  Just pull gently and it releases from the bone with a puff of steam and meat juices rolling down to the plate.  The meat is seasoned, but not overdone.  There's some rub and some smoke flavor, but it's not dominant.  You can really taste the meat.  Barbecue sauce is offered, but with meat this good, who needs it?\n\nSpareribs were also terrific, again partly because they are nice and thick.  They have good texture and are juicy and moist, with good smoke flavor and seasoning.  Baby backs were a little disappointing, still tender, but a little drier, and at least on this day, didn't stack up to the flavor of the spareribs and beef.  \n\nThere are two dining rooms inside and a few tables outside.  The store is just a few blocks off the strip, just on the other side of I-15.  Parking can be tough, but come between the lunch hour and the dinner hour and there's no trouble.  Who doesn't like linner?  Staff was friendly and helpful, joking and laughing, and made a point to come around to all the tables to check on everyone to see how they liked their barbecue. \n\nThere are plenty of sides, and I had the corn fritters.  Folks rave about them.  They're good.   They're fried nuggets of batter encapsulating some sweet corn kernels, but I was here for the ribs, and was not disappointed.  I'll be back again for the brisket and some burnt ends."

            "review": "After hearing the hype for the past couple years and seeing this place featured on TV, I was really excited to come sample some delicious Q, especially since the line to eat at Caesar's buffet was 7 hours long. The Q here isn't sauced and tends to run a little on the drier side, relying primarily on dry rub and smoke for flavor, but they have a variety of sauces to moisturize your meat. We ordered a little of everything, here's the breakdown:\n\nSpareribs: probably one of the better meats here, it's a little dry but with solid rub seasoning, decently flavorful.\nPulled pork: my favorite meat option, probably because it was the right balance of smoke and natural pork flavor, appropriately tender.\nBaby back ribs: too dry, more than a bit of a letdown.\nSmoked chicken: we got white meat, so the dry theme continues. My lady friend said it basically had no flavor, I didn't think it was actually fairly decent.\nBrisket: could be more tender, and not nearly as seasoned as the other meats.\nHot links: essentially smoky and spicy kielbasa, not bad but nothing earth shattering\nBurger: this may have been the highlight between me and my lady friend, they use a combo of smoked brisket with ground beef to make the patty so the burger has a depth of flavor that you wouldn't otherwise typically expect. It's practically impossible to eat without a knife and fork given the mountain of onion strings on top, but that's not really a serious complaint.\nMac and cheese: nothing special, a little on the watery side, needs some seasoning.\nCorn nuggets: these things are like crack, I could eat these all day. Not nearly as creamy in the center as ones I've had in the past, but the sweetness and textured crispiness are on point.\nCorn bread: I want to say the bottom is soaked in a light honey syrup, fairly moist, I'd consider it a win.\n\nWe walked out with nearly 2/3rds of our food as leftovers, which is probably better for my health but a bit of a disappointment since it means I didn't try to gorge myself to exploding. I don't know if this is the best that Vegas has to offer for Q, but I'll probably hold off on coming back here unless my friends really feel the need to satisfy their smoked meat cravings the next time we're in town."

It sits on a bed of mashed potatoes and topped with fried onions. \n\nIts was a perfect combination of flavors on every bite. You had chunks of different type of meats with the creaminess of the mash and the saltiness of the onions. I also got the mac and cheese(YUM!)\n\nAs for the BBQ, it being two boys from ARKANSA that opened up the place the bbq isn't your typical thick sauce type. It's more of a  RUNNY consistency FULL of flavor. \n\nThe drinks are self serve and so are the sauces TRY THEM ALL!. \n\nCustomer service. GREAT. I don't rate on CS but do provide it in order for you to know what you're getting yourself into.\n\nCAN'T WAIT TO VISIT MY SISTER TO GO BACK AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE IN THE MENU."

I tried a little bit of my daughter's ribs and they were good, even with Arkansas style sauce, but I doubt I'll ever order anything other than burnt ends for myself. I haven't tried any of their side dishes, because the burnt ends are too good to eat anything else when I'm there. The sides on the menu sound good though."

We needed to hit it with a lot of sauce, otherwise they were too dry.  Speaking of the sauce, it was pretty decent, but it's a little spicy for my taste.  I think they should offer a regular in addition to the spicy sauce.  The pulled pork was average at best and was more like chunky pork.  The texture and flavor profile wasn't quite right.  The brisket was fairly bland as well.  Either they had an off night, or their meat supplier let them down.  The service and staff really delivered, however.  They were friendly and helpful.  I had much higher hopes for their BBQ based on the reviews.  Their pie and ice cream rocked.  Overall, a bit of a bummer.  I had hoped for 5 star grub."

They have an all u can't eat option that is worth the money and way better than a buffet ... The beef rib had a great flavor and was way meatier than I've ever seen b4...the meatloaf was my other favorite it is triple smoked and u can definitely taste it... It came on mashed potatoes with home made French onions on top ... Besides the food the customer service was fantastic ... Our waiters name was Mitch he made our expierience fun and made sure we tried all the best items... He also told us how some of it was done but made sure not to give up the secret recipes of spices used to do it ... I will defiantly return again!!!!!"

There is a big pit on the side of the building but I got close to it and it wasn't hot, not even warm so it was obvious that it had not been used that day.  I have also noticed that \"BBQ\" places that serve things like nachos, seafood and meatloaf usually have bad BBQ.  I saw excellent reviews here so I decided to give this place a shot.\n\nI ordered the two meat duo with spare ribs and links.  Took forever, about 25 minutes, they should be able to get food out faster, especially if the food is not cooked to order.  The ribs were OK, very little flavor, rather bland, the links tasted like spicy hot dogs.  I also don't understand the green onions.  I've never, ever seen that on BBQ but as I looked around they were on everything.\n\nI'm still on my quest to find decent BBQ west of Texas, doesn't look like it's gonna happen.  I've had BBQ at a gas station in Texas that is better than anything I've found in Cali or Nevada."

            "review": "The restaurant is in a very odd industrial area near auto shops, strip clubs and warehouses, and is probably the only one in the area. You walk in to a haphazard restaurant with not much of a front counter, but instead a confusing podium to order at with no one standing there most of the time. The menu is on a wall kind of near this podium, so you better know what you want before you walk over to order. There are a handful of two, four and large top tables between the two awkwardly cramped rooms of this place, sparsely decorated with a few down lights and some reclaimed wood on the walls. You can tell it was thrown together cheaply, but it seems to fit with the homegrown feel of backyard BBQ. The great smell of smoke fills the space the whole time you sit there, and never really fades away while you're there or from your clothes when you leave.\n\nThe menu features pretty much all the standards you would expect from a BBQ joint, but as I said I was suckered into ordering their Outlaw Burger: brisket, onion, bell pepper, onion strings, red cabbage slaw, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese and chipotle aioli. I'm skeptical of any BBQ place that can't get sweet tea right, so I was nervous about this thing given the somewhat flavorless tea I sat with while waiting for my burger to arrive. And what came out was just too big to enjoy; the patty alone is a thick mass of meat that's possibly a bit overcooked just because of its size and how long it has to cook. The bun was far too small and thin to hold up to this mess, even with a decent helping of lettuce at the bottom to create a buffer from any sauce. Probably the best flavor in this whole thing were the onion rings, which tasted far better on their own than in the burger where they got lost in the myriad of flavors. The huge glob of cheese had good flavor, but like most other things in this burger there was just a bit too much of it. As for the aioli, slaw and other items, I couldn't really tell you much because I didn't notice them enough. I think if this were your typical 1/4 or 1/3 pound burger it would probably be pretty good, still a far cry from the best burger in Vegas as they've claimed, but maybe in the upper half. But like my recent complaints about a huge burger in San Diego, this is just too much to properly enjoy.\n\nSomething extremely puzzling and disappointing for me was the complete lack of fries with my burger. Looking at their menu online now, apparently the $8.99 \"smoking deal\" for the Outlaw Burger is a deal for just the burger, you have to read the small print at the bottom where it says to add $3 for a side and drink. I wish the guy that took my order would have said something as I spent $2 for just my iced tea expecting the fries that were in the picture with my burger. What burger doesn't get ordered with fries?! I guess maybe one of this size, as I surely wouldn't have been able to finish it if I ate anything else, but fries are almost always a necessity. For $11.88 I certainly got a lot of food, but I don't know if it was worth the cost or stomach bomb. I have a feeling that you should stick to the true BBQ that this place is known for, and not their \"best burger\". I know I'll be back to test this theory."

I didn't think I'd be hitting up a BBQ place in Vegas on my last trip out, but we saw the reviews and were nearby (I had to at least go see the cat show at the Riviera), so we squeezed in. The layout of the restaurant was a little disorienting upon entry, given the vast light/dark difference from outside to inside. They have a huge menu on the wall, or printed menus you can take and look at. Order at the counter/cash register/stand thing. They have lots of specials/combos where you get a fountain drink (self serve, with refills), a side, and a main (sandwich, wrap, salad, or just meat by the 'slab'). I was feeling obese that day, so I got a salad with pulled chicken, the cole slaw, and a cornbread. All three things were amazing. My companions had half a smoked chicken which was just ridiculously juicy and smokey. The rest of the crew got brisket sandwiches (pile of brisket on a hotdog/small hoagie bun), mac n' cheese, and beans. The mac n' cheese wasn't met with much enthusiasm given the runniness of the cheese sauce and the firmness or thickness of the type of noodle used. The beans were described as 'kickin' by both the owner and the one at my table eating them, so I imagine that was a good thing. Overall, I will definitely be back here for more BBQ when I'm in Vegas. The food was just too good to not go back."

The highlight, as mentioned before is the Outlaw Burger, that thing hits the bull's-eye! I am especially fond of their jalape\u00f1o slaw, a wonderful kick to that stuff. The potato salad is not one of my faves, a little too bland for me, but that said, it still has this delightful subtle flavor that I can see lots of folks digging, and honestly I would order it again. Great bark on the meats. The sauce at the tables...should you feel the need...offers a complex mix of flavors with a welcomed spicy kick. Most of the sides are prepared in house. One employee told me the fried okra is frozen, but I (and one of my friends) seriously thought it tasted fresh. They must have found a great supplier. This interior is not divey at all, though for some, the location is. Fresh brewed regular and sweet tea. Two separate dining areas with 2 different vibes. Holy smoke, Rollin' Smoke ain't no joke, I felt high driving home and didn't even toke."

I have never had bad service, EVER. \nA couple tips, get the beef ribs if you want ribs, they are huge and great. \nEven though the AYCE price is not $35, if you can handle all that meat, GO FOR IT!

It's comparable to famous daves and memphis bbq but a little on the mom and pop's restaurant kind of service and ambience. Though they could use a little upgrade -- the place was tight, bbq were served on plastic basket with a wrap over the basket, sides were served in styro containers, you have to ask for plates or get it yourself if they have some out, the plastic utensils didnt look clean, sprite tasted funky or maybe it was the ice.\n\nWe ordered the platter (good for two) with four meats -- brisket, pulled pork, chicken, ribs. Pulled pork was the best out of all of them but again average compared to other bbq places. They only have one sauce on the table and it was watery -- the kind that will squirt on your shirt. The tip of the sauce container was not as clean as my (sort of ocd when it comes to food and food handling) self hoped it would be.\n\nThere were a few regulars but mostly tourists it seemed...\n\nDespite of all that ive mentioned about the place being average, it's worth a try."

And that where things got crazy..........\n\nIt's been 5 days and I am still struggling to figure out where to go with this review. Some of what happened was 5 stars and more. Some of what happened was 1 star and less. So I will keep it simple; my son's Biggin' was incredible! My 4 rib combo was okay. I would have liked more flavor, both smoke flavor and seasoning flavor. The service was a mix of being both incredibly entertaining and incredibly bad.\n\nBottom line; although our visit didn't go as well as i would have hoped, when all was said and done they did their best to make things right. It's a great little \"mom and pop\" Q joint that is feeling the blessing/curse of yelp and LV weekly notoriety. I have no doubt they will pull through and I have no doubt I will be back."

I can't believe I never heard about this place until my friend showed me where it is. Don't be fooled by the location, on the outside it may look like you're not even from Vegas at all and you'll contemplate why you're there, but the moment you step inside, it felt like I was actually in Arkansas and the overall vibe was awesome! All I ever saw when I walked in was all the awards that this place got. Not to mention the service was excellent! David (the guy who took our order) is literally the most helpful guy who can explain the best options to get for the menu. We got the \"Rib Special Platter\" (27.99 after taxes) but everything on it was enough to feed at least 2 people and we were a party of 5 so we all shared and pitched in for the food. I can tell you right now, the food was so appealing and mouth watering that when you see it being served, I felt like an animal ready to attack it's prey. LMAO. I was just that hungry to be honest and I've never been so happy and impressed with the service. David complemented me and Daniela (my friend) and just gave us super funny compliments about our names saying I had a cool name and she had a beautiful name. We just bursted out laughing and I swear I couldn't forget that moment. Working in the food industry also for Las Vegas ( I work for Fuku Burger) it reminded me a lot about how much we work so hard in the industry to make sure our customers have the best experience. I have to say this place has really lived up to the standard and as a fellow worker in the food and beverage industry, I salute the men and women who work hard in this. They really give you a one of kind hospitality and make you laugh haha. Maybe it's just the southern hospitality, but you have to experience it to really have a great time. Not to mention this place is perfect for sharing and the food is instagram worthy!!!! I swear I'm coming back to this place now to take girls out on dates and stuff just because it's so unique and fun. Anyways I've had enough to say. I really liked this place and you won't be disappointed."

I had no hope of eating all this food, but it gave me a good cross section of the menu.  For the meats - 1.  Brisquit - nice smoke flavor, good texture, but too dry for my taste.  2. Spareribs - nice smoke flavor, good texture, needs no sauce to be enjoyed - my favorite of the 4.  3.  Beef rib - beautiful bark, good texture, flavor was good, but needed sauce to be enjoyed.  4.  Last and certainly least was the chicken.  It was all dark, so I had high hopes, but I found it over cooked, dry (for a thigh) and pretty flavorless.  I can't recommend the chicken at all.  3 Sides - 1.  Kicken beans - not bad, but I am spoiled by Jack Stack beans in Kansas City - none other has so far come close.  2.  Bacon potato salad - just ok, a bit bland for me.  3.  Side salad with Chipotle dressing - my favorite side.  I would give this place 3.5 stars when compared to the other bbq I have had."

Not spicy, but it has that flavor depth that is needed for an interesting (but not overpowering) BBQ sauce.  It is easily the best pulled pork sandwich I have had, but it is actually one of my most favorite ways I have consumed the pork beast himself.\n\nFor the side, I asked what was most recommended.  I was told to try the mac and cheese :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=GGZosl72mVr20EopFH0CCQ#uGQtCaucN0VVUbvSjXBlkQ\n\nIt was good!  Lots of spices in here...not spicy, but with more depth and distinguishing tastes put into the food here than a normal mac and cheese at most other places.  I can feel the love :P\n\nYelp check-in merited a free dessert...I was recommended the Peach Cobbler (pictured with the sandwich).  It came out piping hot, gooey and tasty....just wish I had some crust in there like the one I love so much at Wing King.  But besides being crustless, this was an excellent rendition.\n\nI will say that there was a miscommunication at order though, and my side also never came out with my food until I reminded them it was missing.  I was strongly considering dropping my 5 to a 4 star, but the food and prices are so good, that I feel guilty holding it against them.  If the order was taken correctly the first time, I doubt I would have had anything to complain about...again, just a miscommunication.\n\nI'll be back!"

The parking lot was packed, the outside picnic tables were packed, and there was a line out the door. The line moved quickly & we ordered within 5 or so minutes.\n\nThe menu is huge, so it might be worth checking it out ahead of time. I ordered the Outlaw Burger with waffle fries, and my husband got the Duo plate with chicken & brisket. We, also, got a side of corn nuggets & a peach cobbler. With 2 drinks, everything came to $25.\n\nYou order at the counter, and seat yourself. Drinks & silverware are self serve. And, when your order is ready, they bring it to your table. While we were waiting, I observed a few people who were obvious regulars. Another good sign.\n\nEvery single item we ordered was excellent. The chicken was super moist and flavorful. The brisket had those delicious crispy pieces on the edges. Waffle fries were crispy and well seasoned. The peach cobbler was warm and gooey!! But, the rock star of our meal was definitely the Outlaw Burger. It. Was. Huge. Like 10\" high huge!\n\nWhen we were wrapping up our leftovers, they didn't have a lid for our cobbler...so they gave us a whole 2nd one to go. It was a little thing, but their service really impressed me.\n\nWe left super full, and already planning what we were going to order next time.

I added a little of their spicy BBQ sauce because I like my BBQ to have a bit of a kick. The spareribs were perfect and the beef ribs were very impressive. Smokey but not overpowering. Dusty came to my table and asked how everything was, and I couldn't compliment him enough. He shared his technique on how he preps the beef ribs. I guess I'll be back, because I certainly don't have that kind of patience!!\n\nIf you're in Vegas craving BBQ, this is the place to go.

The meat has an excellent smoked flavor and the sauce complements it perfectly. The dishes here are unique and do an excellent job highlighting masterful barbequing skills.  I had the Barbeque sundae and highly recommend it.  With layers of mashed potatoes, beans, pulled pork and slaw, it combines all the perfect sides with the 'que in one handy cup.

This burger has lettuce, tomato, cheese,onion straws, a burger patty and brisket.  To take a bite I had to open my jaw as wide as possible and smash the burger down in the process!\n\nThere is no doubt I can say this is the best BBQ burger I've had in my life and for $8 it left me very full (that and the free dessert I received for checking in on Yelp!).  I'm really looking forward to trying other BBQ items on the menu, there was so many good looking things to choose from that it was overwhelming.\n\n6/10/13\n\nJust had the brisket sandwich over the weekend and it was awesome!  Very tender, melt in your mouth good.  I brought a group of friends and everyone thought it was amazing.  I'm so glad they have a large menu because I will want to come back here and try everything!"

My roommate and I came here to satisfy our BBQ fix, and were actually really impressed. \n\nWhen we first arrived, it was busy and no one was at the counter for a while. However, the wait was well worth it because Rollin Smoke Barbeque beats out all the chain BBQ places in Vegas.\n\nInside, there are two dining rooms with one of the rooms being where you order. The rooms fill up quickly when it's busy so if you want to dine-in, try finding a seat first. There are also a few wooden picnic tables outside for outdoor seating.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the trio choice plate with a side of fried okra and an a la carte order of cornbread.\n\nThe trio choice plate was your pick of 3 meats (out of: brisket, pork, 1/4 chicken, 2 spare ribs, or a hot link). Everything about my order was on point. The pork was soft and succulent, with a tenderness that made it practically melt in your mouth. The brisket was probably the highlight of the trio platter. Whenever I go to BBQ places, they usually end up burning some of the brisket, but it was perfect here. Savor these tender cuts of meat because it's THAT good. As for the chicken, it was a little on the pink side, but the parts I did eat had a smokey BBQ flavor. (Don't be afraid to literally drench your food in the BBQ sauce they have on the table!)\nThe fried okra were little bite-sized pieces of heaven. The cornbread wasn't dry like most places; it had a good texture with the classic, sweet cornbread taste.\n\nThe parking lot to this place is on the small side and it can get awkward getting into if you're not alert, but who would've thought that this little treasure would be in the midst of all the plumbing and electrical buildings nearby. \n\nRollin Smoke is a meatlover's dream. If you want BBQ done right, you should definitely go here."

So gave it a try and got the Biggin' sandwich which is a combo of their brisket, pulled pork and hot link all on the same bun.  The bun, is great. Soft and soppy.  The meat, 2 out of 3 were outstanding.  The hot links are great and made in house.  The pulled pork was as good as I've had in Vegas. Didn't care as much for the brisket.  I didn't hate it and it was tender, but it just didn't hold up flavor wise to the other meats.\n   Their Mac n cheese side was solid as was their peach cobbler.

Rolling Smoke is good bbq for Las Vegas but don't expect it to match Texas or Missouri greats in the taste department.

The brisket was fine, but I did not like the pork at all.  It was spiced rather than an authentic bbq-esque dish.  I also had the chipotle coleslaw which was just average.  The house bbq sauce was actually quite good, though.\n\nI'm gong to need to try other bbq places in Vegas to compare, because Rolling Smoke could still be the best in the city, just don't expect the meat to compete with the well known bbq throughout the U.S.."

I ordered the brisket sandwich. The brisket is very soft- almost as soft as the bread itself. The sandwich consisted of the brisket, BBQ sauce, and some chopped green onion. I appreciate the simplicity, but everything was the same texture and it could have used a crunch. I liked it though, and I would order it again. My boyfriend got the rib sampler which consisted of spare ribs, baby backs, and one beef rib. Baby back are excellent, spare ribs are everything you would expect, beef rib is very good as well but he doesn't normally like beef ribs. The sauce itself is good and I liked that they only gave one option, because that's the only one you need. We also had the sides Mac n cheese and jalape\u00f1o coleslaw. In my opinion, these two sides can be skipped. Mac n cheese tasted a little too artificially cheesy, and the coleslaw had an overwhelming jalape\u00f1o flavor. Cornbread was everything you want, sweet, soft, warm, delicious. What really made my experience though, was the amazing staff! They are so helpful and so nice throughout the entire experience.

I'm a true lover of good BBQ and have even taken pilgrimages to places like Memphis, TN and Lockhart, TX in search of the country's best. I feel I have a good frame of reference for evaluating what good BBQ tastes like, and, let me assure you, Rollin' Smoke is damned good BBQ!\n\nEverything I've tried on the menu has been excellent, but the dishes I dream about are the smoked meatloaf--which I have to say may be the single best meatloaf dish I've ever eaten--and the burnt ends, waffle fries and corn fritters. The ribs, chicken and everything else is excellent, but the above dishes were my favorites.\n\nLas Vegas is frankly very lucky to have BBQ of this caliber, as very few cities in America do. The manager is super friendly, and the whole staff is very friendly and accommodating. They also give a discount to locals, showing that they appreciate those of us who live here and support these businesses on a regular basis.\n\nI know I'm going to leave with a smile on my face every time I eat here, and I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Unlike many on Yelp, I don't give out five-star ratings easily, but Rollin' Smoke has earned it! Please support this great Las Vegas restaurant! My only complaint is that they close at 8pm Mon-Fri, but the most important thing is that their food is truly outstanding!"

This is a must visit. It is easy to spend the entire time eating on the strip but this is only 10 minutes away.  It is definitely worth the trip.\n\nThe beef ribs were cooked perfectly.  The burnt ends were moist and tasty. The baked beans and yams were also great side dishes.  Did not try any of the pork products but I am sure they were the same or better. \n\nThe place is very informal.  You order and pay on a line then site at one of the picnic tables either inside or outside.  They will bring the food to you.  The staff is great, friendly, and as I was ordering for 5 strong willed people they were patient too."

I was super happy when the stars aligned and we got Jessie and her hubby Bill, Dyanna and her man Brent and Joel and I all in one place for dinner. This was also Jessie's and Bill's first time as well as ours. \n\nIt was a Saturday night so it was busy. It's the kinda spot you order first and then you find seating. Joel ordered the famous Outlaw burger and I got the Triple meat with brisket, ribs, and hot links my side was potato salad and Joel's side was Mac & cheese. We totally lucked out and scored a large table big enough for all of us. It seemed like we just sat down and our names were called and out came the order. Wow! Joel's burger was huge! Like so big he didn't know how to start on it. He enjoyed it a lot. The Mac & cheese was ok nothing special. I really liked my brisket and hot links. The meat was tasty and tender. I was disappointed that the ribs were tough. Because I expected fall off the bone tender. Not a big fan of Rollin' Smokes sauce either. I prefer a thicker sauce. I did enjoy the potato salad and it reminded me a lot of what I make at home. Joel also used the Yelp check in offer for a free dessert. He choose the banana pudding which he loved. \n\nThe atmosphere was bare, but had picnic tables and TVs. The dining area is split into two rooms. Because the turn over is so quick the tables tend to get dirty which is the downside. The staff was friendly, but since they were super busy they might have needed more people. \n\nThe food didn't blow me away, but it was good. I want to go back again to try some other things on the menu. Plus, they did have excellent pickles!!! What a fun night! Glad to be able to check Rollin Smoke off my Yelp bookmarks list!"

There are a couple tables outside and a handful of tables inside...but, be warned, open seats and tables are at a premium at times as this place gets packed because they are just THAT good! I ate there for dinner yesterday and woke up craving their food...agh! The beef bones were out of this world flavorful and tender...the meat just fell off the bones. I wanted to try the bacon potato salad and they were out of it so I tried macaroni and cheese and yams...these are now my favorite sides. They brought us an order of potato salad after they made a new batch, but I liked the yams and macaroni and cheese the best. The owners and staff are very welcoming and friendly and stop by the tables to get feedback from their diners...when they spoke to us, they informed us that they are opening a second location that will include a bar. Of all the many places I've had the pleasure of eating BBQ this makes my list of my top three favorites...the other two are in (1) San Diego and (2) Winnipeg, Manitoba. Give this place a shot...I'm so glad I did!"

Being someone who barbecues and smokes a great deal, I was a bit skeptical since other \"bbq\" joints we've tried just never measured up. I am happy to say this one did. We both had a three meat combo, with both of us having the pulled pork and brisket. My wife went with the spare ribs and I had the hot link for our third meat. We both found the brisket to be moist and tender with a great flavor and just the right amount of smoke. The pulled pork was moist and tender as well, though it could have used a bit more smoke and maybe some bite to it, more of a personal preference though. Fpr the sides my wife had the waffle fries which were good, but it's hard to screw up fires. I went with the bacon potato salad which was excellent, I also got an order of the corn nuggets which were nothing short of Oh my God good. Though it is a bit of a drive from where we live, we will be back.  To Dusty and the rest of the folks at Rollin Smoke, thanks for giving Vegas good bbq."

Those at the table also got the bacon potato salad, the waffle fries and the corn nuggets.

I would definitely suggest sharing.  \n\nMy other favorite is their meatloaf.  You're probably thinking 'C'mon... Meatloaf?' Oh yeah.  It's combination of smoky meats baked, placed on loaded mash and topped with sauce and onion straws.  It's mouth watering fantastic.  \n\nI have yet to find something here I didn't like.

I was in Vegas for about a week and this place stood out to me above most of the places I ate at here. I came here after walking around Fremont Street so it was on my way back to the Hotel.  At night this side street is dark and in an industrial part of town so if you're not used dark back roads come here in the day. The place seems small from outside but once inside it is pretty decent sized with outdoor seating. I got to the counter and the lady was nice enough to recommend the Rib platter special since I wanted to try so many different items. I also ordered the peach cobbler a la mode and a side of baked potato salad with two sauces their signature and their damn hot sauce. I took everything to go and once I drove 15 minutes to my room we tried all the food and it was amazing. It had a good hint of smoke and all the meat was soft and falling off the bone in the best possible way. The signature sauce was like liquid crack and I was about to drink it and the Damn hot was exactly what it says. I love spicy but the hot sauce burns all over your mouth so I am good with that but it had flavor so if you can handle it go for it. AS for the peach cobbler it was good and I like it but my wife likes crust and would have liked a bit more but flavor was on point. So I know I am coming back when I am in town and that happens at least once a year"

Warrior Football game.......what better way to end the evening then to eat some Ba Ba Barbeque!!!!\n\nMy friend suggested this place called - \"Rollin Smoke Barbeque\" so we flipped on our GPS and headed to the back roads to a seedy part of town (where there were a lot of strip clubs, bars, & adult book stores).........but then when we finally found this place and walked in............ I was in Ba Ba Barbeque heaven!!!!\n\nThe restaurant was really packed, and as we walked to the counter, the friendly clerk took our orders. After you order your food, you find an open table (good luck), and when your food is ready, they will bring your order out to you.\n\nThere is a Sauce station within the restaurant where you can get additional BBQ sauce. I want to point out.........try the \"Mama Sweet\" BBQ sauce! It was bomb @ss good! My friend liked this BBQ sauce so much, I actually saw him put it in a little cup & drink the sauce! That's how much he loved the BBQ sauce!\n\nBefore you sit down at your table, you will also have to get your own plastic eating utensils, napkins, as well as your own drinks, as the soda fountain within the restaurant was self serve.\n\nFor my meal that night, I ordered the \"Trio Choice of Meats\" - where I picked the following - Brisket, 1/4 Chicken, & 2 Spare Ribs. ($17.99)\n\nOne of my friends also ordered the \"Trio Choice of Meats\"  - where he picked the Brisket, 2 Spare Ribs, & Hot Links. ($17.99)\n\nAnd my other friend ordered the \"Duo Choice Of 2 Meats\" - where he picked the Brisket, & Pulled Pork. ($13.99)\n\nWith our meals came with a side, and I ended up taking the corn bread. All of our meals came with collard greens, and the collard greens had some kind of smoked meat mixed inside.\n\nWhat can I say about the grub?\n\nI totally loved the BBQ Chicken! The chicken meat was all so soft, and the meal literally fell off the bone.......nice smokey flavor too! \nThe spare ribs was also delicious, and I just loved how the meat came off of the bone so easily! I really loved how soft the BBQ ribs were....... \nAs for the brisket.........it was just okay for me. Loved the smokey flavor, but I gotta tell you the brisket wasn't very soft. I've had better tasting brisket on Oahu.......from \"Verde\" in Kaimuki.\n\nOverall a pretty good barbeque joint! No frills..........kinda of place, and they definitely churn out some pretty great barbeque meats! \n\nBe careful of your surroundings when coming here........if I was with my girlfriend, I'd probably pass on this place.........my friend also mentioned to me that if he was here with his wife & kids, he'd probably do the same."

Ordering happens at the cashier up front and the wait wasn't bad but considering that we went on a Saturday around 11:30am it probably gets incredibly busy later in the afternoon. \n\nThe lady taking our order was super friendly and she recommended trying the burnt edges brisket. They do have an up charge and I am not sure how much but it was totally worth it. I ordered the combo two meat plate: burnt edges brisket & chicken and for my side I choose the corn nuggets. \n\nMy husband got sliced brisket & chicken and his sides were Mac & cheese and collards. \n\nThe burnt edges were so delicious and I can confidently say way better then the sliced version. I would pass on the collards and the chicken. The collards were too salty for my taste and the chicken was dry. However, the Mac and cheese and the corn nuggets were excellent. \n\nWe will be back from some more burnt edges brisket and Mac&Cheese!"

I ended up ordering the beef hot link sandwich combo. It came with a drink and one side. When my order came out I looked at it and knew it was not going to be enough to fill me up. The price you pay for the amount of food you get was not justifiable to me. You get a small side that's as big as a KFC side and a plain hot link on bread.

The hot link was okay as well, it tasted like the ones you buy at the grocery store. \n\nService was fast and cashier was friendly.

First, one has to learn about the place, then one has to hunt it down, then one has to resist the urge to leave... because NO barbecue restaurant worth it's prices boasts the most upscale  atmosphere or structural amenities. \n\nBut then the food comes; and one is suddenly more happy to be sitting at that grubby, sweaty little picnic table than they could have ever anticipated. \n\nSo, that being said, Rolling Smoke Barbecue is the finest quintessential barbecue experience I've had in fifteen years in Las Vegas. \n\nI learned about Rolling Smoke from one of their newest team-members, \"Chef\" Nick. He's been a close friend of mine for years, and he has been doing an amazing job promoting the business. He greeted me when I came in, too, which was classy. \n\nThe service otherwise was gracious and friendly, the Atmosphere was as modest as barbecue gold mines can get, and the food...\n\nWow... The food.\n\nThe ribs, brisket, and pork I purchased practically melted in my mouth, leaving behind only the subtle texture of the meats' not-so-subtle spice rub; a rub that thankfully doesn't overpower the undeniably robust flavors of the proteins themselves. \n\n...A flavor that makes it completely understandable that the restaurant is perpetually inundated with a line of hungry patrons. Don't worry - though - the kitchen has it down and they churn out an order every fifty seconds or so.\n\nOh, and at just over $15 (prior to well-earned gratuity), this barbecue meal is certainly worth the price. \n\nPlease, go check this place out. It will leave you entirely satisfied and grateful that you stuck around."

The sauce was terrific, but the meat was so good, it didn't need sauce, so I ate 1/2 with & 1/2 without.  My son was excited to have good ol' sweet tea since we now live in Utah & it's hard to find.  The banana pudding was the best I've ever had at a restaurant & truly tasted like grandma made it.

He got the AYCE special for $34.99, and I got a 2 meat combo plate and added a drink. The total was around $60 for both of us. This is an order at the counter, seat yourself place which I dont mind at all. \n\nThe AYCE special is anything on the menu any day and anytime. The menu consists of a plethora of meats, burgers, sandwiches, sides, and desserts. My bf loaded up on the meats, I think he tried pretty much every meat in the place. Ribs, meatloaf, chicken, pulled pork and wings, just to name a few. His consensus is the meatloaf is bomb and the baby backs are delicious. He enjoyed the other meats as well, but those were his favorite. He had 3 plates each consisting of 3 meats AND sides, so he definitely got his moneys worth. If you have a hearty appetite, AYCE is the way to go.\n\nFor my meal, I got a 2 meat combo with chopped brisket and spare ribs, and for my side I chose mac & cheese. The food was delicious. I really loved the ribs. They were so tender and meaty and fall off the bone. A good rib needs no sauce, and these did not need any. Speaking of sauce, they have like 5 different bbq sauces, ranging from sweet to spicy. I personally love a good vinegar based sauce, so I enjoyed their Carolina sauce the best. But they have something for everyone. The chopped brisket was yummy too, although I would probably get the brisket sliced next time. The only thing I did not like was the mac and cheese. It was realllly runny and pretty bland, but they have like 10 other sides to choose from. I can't wait to come back for some more yummy BBQ."

Until that time, I try to keep my visits here to a couple a month.  Given how good the food is, that has proven difficult.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I took some co-workers here and one of them ordered the fried shrimp.  I know!  Stupid, right?  WRONG!  Because she eats like a bird, she gave each of us a piece and dang!  That was some amazing fried shrimp.  The batter has a lot of spices and is similar to the cornmeal batter used for catfish.  So good.  The regulars in our group agreed that the fried shrimp is our next order.  \n\nLately, I've noticed that business is really picking up.  Glad to see it, but I considered keeping my mouth shut about this place from now on.  My duties as a Yelper won out in the end.  I go to lunch pretty early, so my current mission is to make it here when the greens are ready (these take a hot minute to cook right), because there's really not much I love more than good greens.  If my meaningful physical relationship with another human being does not work out, I may marry The Pulled Piggy with a side of kickin beans."

HOWEVER, they're putting out some of the best BBQ you've ever tasted. \n\nI went with the burnt ends brisket, hot links, and waffle fries. For dessert I got peach cobbler a la mode. \n\nThe guy at the checkout counter (Dave) was unbelievably nice. Even though the line was long he took the time to give me suggestions specific to what I like and what id ordered. So matched the best sides with my meats. The wife went with brisket chopped and yams. Everything was GREAT. \n\nThe sweet tea is housed in Nestea containers so I thought it was going to be the syrup mixed with water. But I watched them pouring brewed sweet tea into the top. Impressed! \n\nThe dessert was good but I would say that in the future I won't get the ice cream inside on top. I think it may have taken away from the deliciousness of the cobbler. \n\nRegardless, I highly recommend this place."

I had the BBQ meatloaf last time,  which was amazing,  I would call it one of their signature dishes for sure.  The ribs are great,  the chicken was a little undercooked today but great flavor my friend said.  I got the catfish as the guy there told me it was the best in town,  and that it was,  big claim but he came through and delivered.

I was impressed with the overfull parking lot and the line out the door, thinking this must be some good stuff. \n\nThe place seemed kind of run down, and the Aquarium was really disappointing. I guess it lets you know how much they care about their place. After all, who pays thousands, or tens of thousands for a custom aquarium, then replaces the amazing fish with feeder goldfish, the tank was dirty and the special features didn't function. \n\nBack to the restaurant though, so I order, and while ordering my wife wanted some sauce to go, and the menu has prices for cup, pint, quart, gallon or whatever. I ordered a pint of house and a pint of Carolina. We ordered to eat there and paid the $50 for the 2 of us. We went and sat down, about 20 minutes later I went looking for our food, that never came, and found a girl, food runner, whatever, with our food boxed up to-go in a bag wandering around looking for us... Confusing since I ordered for dine in...\n\nTook the bag to my wife and we opened it to start eating, and there were in addition to the 2 Styrofoam clamshells with our food, like 16 little tiny 2oz sauce ramekins. Not the glass Mason jars in the case. \n\nI thought the meatloaf was borderline just ok, It pretty much just crumbled apart, had to use the mashed potatoes as a binder to keep the bits of meat on the fork. I make better meatloaf myself, in fact I smoke better food in general than they do. My wife had the Pulled Pork, she \"enjoyed\" it, but didn't finish it\n\nAs a BBQ connoisseur, having enjoyed BBQ in Texas and several other states, I would have to say this does not even come close to ranking as good BBQ. \n\nLife is short, so I would not likely return."

The 4 is actually a 4.5 (unfortunately Yelp doesn't offer that option) because I rate my dining experience on food, atmosphere and service. My few niggles to follow later.\n\nIf anyone is hesitant about the area,  don't be.  You can smell the smoky goodness down the block and it will draw you in like the crack den of BBQ that it is.\n\nThis is a family run hole in the wall and the plastic cutlery atmosphere suits it.  We sat in the mural covered back room, our first hint that the owners hailed from Arkansas.  We didn't even know that Arkansas \"did\" BBQ, my who knew concerning that state began and ended with the now Vegan Bill Clinton; little did I suspect that I would be in for a presidential Q.\n\nWe arrived around 3:00, as they close at 8:30 PM Monday-Thursday and made our way to the back room before we placed our order at the podium in the front room.  And here comes a niggle-most of the tables were not wiped down and nor would they be for some time after we arrived.  I don't mind lolling around in my own juicy, fat and Q juice runoff, but I'm not a fan of cleaning up someone else's.  Niggle two was a less than pristine bathroom.  I'm hoping that all this was due to the time of day, more than a recurrent daylong drawback.\n\nWe both ordered the $24.95 all you can eat, so we could sample a greater number of things and graze off of each other's plates.  We placed our order with John (one of the owners) I was trying to gauge the amount of food that we would be getting and he thought my beef rib order would be a bit too much, but I let him know I was a good little eater.  I may be short, but I do have some amazing chow down capacity.\n\nWe then prepared ourselves for a leisurely wait, eagerly sniffing in the smoke fumes.  There were only two diners in our room, and one of them decided to share his phone Gangsta Rap at mega-volume, I stopped sniffing at the air and unleashed a very annoyed and loud \"REALLY!?!?!\" but it wasn't until his food arrived (fortunately quickly) that this rude dipshit lowered his personal jukebox.\n\nThen our meal arrived and the gluttonous food orgy began.  For sides we had the corn bread, fried onion straws, greens, corn nuggets-all contenders for a pure outstanding deliciousness award, some tasty curly fries and a ok roll.  For meats we had pulled pork, hot links, beef ribs, pork ribs, rib tips-all perfectly smoked and overwhelmingly delectable.  The chicken and brisket were good and the sauce was nicely spiced not too sweet. We ate till it hurt; leaving the final stretch of mass stomach expansion for dessert, a tasty berry cobbler and banana pudding.\n\nHalfway through my cobbler I hit my max and gave up.  If we could have lolled around and napped we might have been able to finish, or explode.  I stopped short of saving a well picked bone to save and use as a Pebbles Flintstone hair clip just so I could savor that smoky goodness for the rest of the day.\n\nBig kudos to John and his family for taking the chance on this business.  We loved their attentive service, hospitality.  We will be back once we recover from the meat sweats and BBQ hangover!"

Everything was amazing! The chopped brisket was cooked perfectly, it was very tender and it didn't contain any fatty pieces. Rolling Smokes barbecue is a bit expensive but it's worth every penny. Their barbecue is excellent!"

Stop reading this and go there now, you won't be sorry. \n\nLas Vegas did not have Barbeque until Rolling Smoke opened, thank God they are here.\n\nEverything about this place is GREAT!  I could go on for paragraphs about the food.  We ordered some of everything,  even the catfish. \n\nBrisket - AMAZING (not fatty,  cooked perfect),  Pulled Pork - OUT OF THIS WORLD, Spare Ribs - MOUTH WATERING, Chicken- VERY GOOD (it may have been touch dry but I couldn't tell because I covered it in their delicious sauce), Catfish - one of the best I have had,  light crispy and flavored perfect a  definite surprise for a BBQ joint.  There is basically no dish on the menu that you can go wrong with, even the sides were great.\n\nNow about the service:\n\nI was worried when we pulled up;  the place is small and there was literally a line out the door (Saturday night dinner).  Remarkably,  the line was so quick we barely waited - I don't know how they did it but it was perfect.  We got amazing personal service and it was quick (figure that one out).  If the food is amazing,  then the service is AMAZING x10!\n\nAfter we placed out order our waiter,  a younger guy with blonde dread lock type hair, delivered it to our table.  The place was packed,  I had been watching the waiter and he never stood still  or stopped moving,  it was BUSY but he took the time to tell us about each dish and came back 3 times to see if we liked everything. Not only did he come by the but the Chef came over to each table to welcome the customers,  tell them about the dishes and make sure they liked everything.  We even had one more guy from the kitchen come over and check on us.  It was amazing service,  you just don't get service like that in Vegas anymore.  You can see everyone obviously loves their job and loves that restaurant - the attitude a made the place fun and enjoyable to a whole different level.  I can't say enough good things about our waiter,  he was 5 star service and just a nice guy- we would probably go back for him alone but the food is the shining star of this place.\n\nThe only regret I have is that I forgot to buy Barbeque sauce to take home,  good excuse to go back this week :)"

Feeling the hunger pangs that had been growing all day we decided to go against the Vegas standard of hitting up a buffet and stopped in. It's a small place, rather unimpressive from the outside and your standard BBQ joint in the inside but you won't regret the food! We ordered the rib tips, the burnt ends and the hot links, all by the pound and shared between the all of us as a snack. Everyone was in agreement that it was some of the best bbq they've ever tasted and I'd have to agree. Spicy, smokey and not the overly sweet stuff other places serve. The favorite had to be the burnt ends, I could've eaten just that with some of the sides that I was eyeing. Next Vegas trip, I'm forgoing a buffet and spending a few good hours and eating the all you can eat special they've got there. Here's to next time!"

Located on South Highland where outdoor smokers and burning hickory alert the senses to something more than industrial surroundings Rollin Smoke is as small and homey as many a' Texas or Kansas City 'cue spots and staffed by Razorback pitmaster Trey Holland plus a dedicated team of enthusiasts the service is every bit on par with that down south - a true love of the art noted in lengthy answers to questions about woods, temperatures, and process while simultaneously making sure every guest is content.  Featuring a diverse menu with spices and rubs harkening the style of BBQ found across the south but a bit more aggressively sweet than that in Texas it was with a trio of smoked meats, two must-order sides, and buttery cornbread that I began and although brisket was a bit drier than I'd prefer the smoke was prominent and flavor was on point - a trend extending to fatty ribs and supple pulled pork that lacked not for juices, the latter falling just short of KC's Oklahoma Joe's reference standard.  Still nibbling at the creamy corn nuggets as plate two arrived it was here that I sampled Holland's two most raved items and with a blackened caramelized crust overlying tender flesh and melted collagen the beef rib wowed just as much as the signature meatloaf, absolutely rife with hickory notes and light heat amidst a delicately packed beef.  Ignoring decent but mundane chicken and mac n' cheese I found inedibly bland compared to the rich potatoes and previous fried sides it was with a duo of desserts that I rounded out the tasting and suffice it to say that while banana pudding tastes straight from a box the focus should instead be directed to the cobbler, a bubbling bowl of soft peaches with buttery pie crust crowned with Texas' own Blue Bell vanilla - a perfect end to a pretty damned good meal by any standard."

Fast forward a bit to after everyone else has their food, I decide to go in and see what's up with my order.\n\nThe lady checks my ticket and goes to see where it is. She comes back and tells me \"it'll be right out\". I wait another 10 minutes and see many other orders come out, but not my order. I ask again and she checks again, then tells me \"just a couple more minutes\". 10 minutes later I ask her \"am I going to get a burger today?\", so she checks again. 5-10 minutes after that she comes out and says \"they have it on now\".\n\nA full hour after I ordered, after all my coworkers have finished their lunch, and after every other table in the place received their order, they finally bring my burger out. I had to take it to go, since I spent my whole lunch break waiting for it.\n\nThe guy who brought it out was nice and threw in some fries, but I was upset at that point. I paid $13 for a burger, even left a good tip when I signed the receipt thinking I'll be the nice guy who tips at these places, and the lady who caused all of this didn't even attempt to apologize.\n\nNeedless to say, even though the food was decent, they just lost business from 7 locals, out of which I was overly excited to try the food here.\n\nWe most likely will never be back.\n\nThanks for the fries, mr. server."

Maybe it was high expectations due to the many 4-5 star reviews, maybe I just don't know good barbeque when I eat it. By no means am i a BBQ connoisseur but here's my take on this place. I can only comment on the brisket and the sides I ordered. I got a to go order of 1lb. of brisket, a side of loaded mash, yams, & mac n' cheese. When I opened up the container with the brisket I was really irritated because it was chopped. Maybe that's my fault because I assumed it would be sliced. I know some places ask if you want it sliced or chopped like Dickey's but the cashier never asked so I guess I assumed. Ok fine it's chopped no crying over that. However it wasn't really even chopped it was really in small, tiny pieces, like the kind of little pieces that are left from sliced meat. I feel like it was all the scraps leftover from slicing. All of the pieces were dark, like the outer crust of the meat. I couldn't find any pieces in there that were grayish like it is in the center. This probably explains why it was overly salty since it was all the outer pieces. Thank goodness there was a slice of bread underneath because it would have been really hard to eat alone. I didn't even want to put any sauce on it since it was too salty. Oh and I got a little small container of sauce for 1lb of brisket but I guess in my situation it didn't matter. It just wasn't enjoyable at all. As far as the sides go, they were ok. Nothing spectacular. Yams were good, mac n cheese decent, loaded mash was similar to Dickey's mash which is decent. Maybe I need to try their brisket sliced, maybe I need to try something else on their menu. I don't know. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon which is too bad because I really wanted to love this place."

I personally thought the food was below average like a lot worse than The franchise DICKIES that we have in California. \n\nI HAD the lemon pepper chicken wings and had the dirty rice. I also tried the brisket and beans... Which all were not quite good. The wings had waaaaay too much lemon pepper seasoning and the dirty rice was not anything special. \n\nI gave zero stars to the food but service was on point so I gave a two star for that."

Proximity search brought this place to the top of the list and I headed over.\n\nFrom the outside, the place looks like a real hole in the wall, which it is...this place has soul.  Before you even walk through the doors, the aroma of smoked meats sets forth the salivary glands into full production.\n\nI ordered the Trio plate with pulled pork, spare ribs and brisket with a side of hush puppies.  For the money, the volume of food is a very good value.  I managed to eat about 3/4 of the plate and the leftovers easily comprised a separate meal.   The flavor of the meat was delicious and the sauce complemented the meal perfectly.  Even the hush puppies had a nice underlying spice to them that was quite addicting.  Something as simple as properly seasoning hush puppies tells me there is attention to detail here. \n\nGood food can get you four stars but its the staff that pushed it to five for me.  They were incredibly friendly and upbeat.  You can tell when a place is well-run by just listening to how they interact with each other.  It was clear that this staff really cares about what they do and have a passion for their craft.\n\nThanks for a great meal!"

Alright so maybe the chef will encourage you to shout it when you leave, but it takes little convincing, trust me!\n\nMy knowledge of barbeque is limited, but I mean I own a Traeger Grill, does that count for anything? No? I didn't think so either... but while my Traeger makes deliciously smoked clean meats it doesn't compare to the smokey glistening glory of RSB. Their ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ is what makes Vegas or America in general really freaking awesome. I mean sure we're in the top 10 for most obese countries, but hey at least we do it right, RIGHT? \n\nThe special is $25 and includes EVERYTHING on the menu, except drinks ($2), you gotta buy that, BUT... its pretty much all you can drink too. Don't pass on the Outlaw Burger,  the beef ribs, or the nachos, but do pass on the pulled pork. Don't wear a belt, its useless, no belt will make look skinny after the massacre.

My rental guided me down the strip and turned left at TRUMP Hotel and crossed under freeway till I land in the industrial dump of parking lot. But when you want the best BBQ who cares about its surroundings. \n\nNow I had this place on my radar for sometime and finally manned up and went. BBQ so damn good make you wanna slap your own face. I'd say the best BBQ on the West Coast and defiantly in Vegas. I've had BBQ all over the country however the  BBQ meatloaf is flipping sensational. In all my barbecue eating sessions I had never encountered BBQ meatloaf and it didn't fail my tastebuds. Meatloaf set on mash potatoes and sauce plus a stack of shredded deep fried onions for crunch and scallions for extra flavor.\n\nI've been back and had the ribs which are nice and meaty with perfect smoke rings. No sauce needed on them cause there amazing and very tasty. Also the hot links hold there own with a nice kick to them and condiments of Mac Cheese made your meal. It's a perfect side dish here cause it's not creamy or watery but cooked just like mom makes. \n\nI've got a wish list of items to order so I'll be making pit stop soon. FRANK gives a double thumbs up for Rollin Smoke BBQ, so put this on your list of culinary needs to consume."

We ordered 3 lbs of brisket, 1.5 slabs of spare ribs, a slab of beef ribs, and some sides of potato salad, mac n cheese, onion strings, and corn balls.  \n\nWe ordered all the meats dry and with sauce on the side and also asked for their spicy bbq sauce.  The test for good bbq is how their meat tastes without sauce.  This place definitely passed the test  I'm not usually a fan of bbq sauce anyway, but this place definitely does not need sauce.  The rub they use on their meats were delicious.  The beef rib was so nice and fatty and it basically melts in your mouth.  The flavor of the spare ribs were good too.  However, the meat on spare ribs should easily fall of the bone, and these did not.  \n\nThe sides were ok.  I liked the bacon potato salad.  I wasn't a fan of the other stuff. Although my friends really liked the corn ball things. \n\nDefinitely worth a shot, but it can be busy.  Some of the other reviews said it was hard to get a seat.

I've never written a Yelp review before this, but I feel it is my obligation to tell the worlds how delicious this food is.\n\nI came to Las Vegas to play poker and eat good food.  After eating dinner at this place late Saturday night, I am heartbroken that it's closed on Sunday because I was ready to head back the next day for lunch to have the $25 all-you-can eat (ANYTHING ON THE MENU!!!) feast.\n\nThe ribs literally fell off the bone.  I cut the brisket with a plastic fork.  The bbq sauce was incredible.  Do yourself a favor and get the smoked meatloaf, which is served on a bed of some of the best mashed potatoes and is smothered in tasty onion strings.\n\nThe staff was super friendly.  They were happy to tell me all about the food.  They all seemed to have a great deal of pride and respect for the food they served.\n\nEat here."

Parking lot is decent sized. \n\nCall ahead if you want your order ready when you arrive. They charge if you want sauce to go, pretty stupid, who doesn't want sauce on the side. The spicy sauce is good.\n\nThey have a 10% off coupon on their website, just show them the coupon online and save some money.\n\nRib Platter - $24.99 - Comes with 1 beef rib, 2 spare ribs, and 3 baby back ribs. I love when bbq places have combos like this because I love to try everything they offer. Beef rib was huge and had tender flakey meat. Spare rib fell off the bone and was moist. Baby backs were a little dry. Seasoning was peppery with a little hint of sweet. My side was the Corn Nuggets which were like cream corn poppers, so good.\n\nBrisket, fatty, 1lb - $18.99 - Meat melted in your mouth. You can pull it apart with your fingers. \n\nHalf Smoked Chicken - $9.99 - Good smoke. Had some good juicy meat but some pieces were dry.\n\nBurnt Ends, 1/2lb - $12.99 -  Disappointing. Not moist or fatty. Very little bark. They do not allow quarter pound orders either."

No need to request medium rare as the burgers smoked to perfection. The biggin dads favorite had a mix of 3 meats that taste like they were bred in the same farm. I cant say how happy we are with the food and service. The hot sauce made my buddy tear up, tasty stuff. I feel like I can make a mess of myself,  wear a bib made of paper napkins and feel proud doing it. Free refills on the drinks and quality friendly staff make this place a obvious no 1 choice for bbq. Gordon ramsey abd his 20dollar burger can rot compared to a gem like this. one of the best burgers I ever tasted. The staff is so wholesome and authentically country with the way they carry themselves and the food, by mere presence they made me think they are co owners with the pride they have for their food. I didnt detect any of the fake kindness you often see at regular food joints. The owners should be proud of themselves and their staff."

Shout out to the Chef (think Chef Tim) who is absolutely wonderful, personable, and friendly.\n\n\"Heads up\" If you like beer with your BBQ, you'll be disappointed to find that one of the locations (bigger one) does not have a bar or sell alcohol.\n\nYou MUST check this place out when in Vegas!  Hands down, some of the best BBQ I've had in my life including that from Kansas City."

While Rollin Smoke's location may be subtle and discrete, its food is definitely not. All their smoked meats and sauces are gluten-free. The meat here is simply phenomenal. If you you're a big boy or girl that can eat, go for the AYCE for $35 - anything on the menu is fair game. \n\nThe times I've been here, I've stuck to the combos. The pit special is more than enough for two people if you like variety. I love the brisket, pulled pork, and spare ribs, but less of a fan of the chicken and hot links. Today's visit, my friend and I shared the rib platter special and were not disappointed. The baby back ribs and St. Louis spare ribs were some of the best I've had. One beef rib would've been enough to share, but we added on an extra for $6. To top it off, we added a 1/2 pound of burnt ends with a side of waffle fries and corn nuggets. I've had burnt ends before, but they were nothing like these. These burnt ends were juicy, tender, and so flavorful that they required no sauce. The corn nuggets are now my favorite side! I've also liked the mac & cheese and cornbread in the past. \n\nDespite having over a thousand rave reviews, I like to think that this joint is still one of Vegas' best kept secrets. It reminds me of Freddy's BBQ from House of Cards - amazing ribs and food, but only if you're in the know. I still have yet to try the infamous outlaw burger, but I saw it pass by today and it had me mesmerized. Until next time my hungry friends."

Rollin' Smoke offers what I consider the most authentic BBQ in Las Vegas by a long shot. There aren't any competitors even worth mentioning to compare.\n1) Atmosphere: it's a rather small property that's divided into a few section, one where you place your orders/grab your drinks, utensils etc/some seating available, and two other sections offering seating as well. Regardless of how you're eating (take-out, dining in, a la carte, all-you-can-eat), there is one line for all. You can sit wherever you'd like while you wait for your food to be delivered including outdoors. \n2) Service: Everyone on staff is super friendly and very helpful. It was our first time there and we didn't feel rushed while we took a minute in line getting an explanation of how the menu works. Food was delivered timely and correctly. \n3) Food: I'll start with saying my ribs literally fell off the bone when I picked up my first bite. Now...\nAll-you-can-eat is $24.95 and includes anything on the menu. Pace yourself! You can always come back for more. We grabbed a bit of each meat and were very pleased with every type- ribs, brisket, chicken, catfish (very fresh, lightly crunchy and not fishy-tasting). Everything was exceptional, including our sides of Mac and cheese, cole slaw and hush puppies. Oh the hush puppies! So yummy! Dessert was awesome. Next time we'll have to try our berry cobbler a la mode. \n\nLooking forward to coming back next time. Thanks guys!"

I get beef every time (beef ribs, brisket all ways), however I try their other meats when my friends get them and they are solid as well. Its one of those places that always makes you leave satisfied and feigning for a nap. The staff are warm and welcoming, and the decor is barbecue-y (a lot of Arkansas Razorbacks stuff). \n\nA definite highlight of this place is their sauces. Their sauces have a ton of depth in flavor, and for the spicy lovers, their hot bbq sauce has a kick to it as well. \n\nPrices are decent as I would definitely not consider this cheap eats, but this place is definitely worth the money. Visitors of Vegas should definitely try to visit this place. Oh yes, if you're going to strip clubs at night, pick one that is near this place because they open LATE. \n\nOnly downsides of this place is the location of the place (industrial, empty during the daytime, and I haven't been at night) and that parking is hard to come by because their lot is small. If you are not driving, consider using a rideshare program like Uber/Lyft to get there."

Greens the same. Mashed potatoes where a little better. If i were to go back i would definitely probably just get ribs or a brisket or chicken sandwich. Sides taste like something on the strip.

The decor felt completely original. It enhanced the experience and wasn't distracting. There were a few picnic tables out front which I have come to love about authentic barbecue joints.\n\nBrisket (upgraded to burnt ends), ribs, and coleslaw with a drink and a piece of bread for $22 felt steep for the amount of food we got, yet by the end I was thoroughly stuffed and for that reason, I actually feel like this is a good deal. I believe the quality of the meat and technique were excellent, which deserves a higher price point. Did I mention that it was delicious? It was delicious. The brisket was crispy on the outside with the soft, delicate, juicy interior that I have come to love. The ribs fell right off the bone. They had authentic Carolina vinegar which cut through the fatty brisket. Their mustard base sauce had excellent tang and was good, but I bet it would go better on smoked chicken. Their sweet sauce really shined though. It is tomato based (instead of molasses) and it was just sweet enough. Really complemented the smokiness of the meat."

But I understand it's a small place with high demand so I already account for that prior to my arrival. Heard there's a second location downtown -- will be checking it out someday soon!"

The pulled pork was not at all pulled, it was chopped. Not a single piece had any fat, bark or irregular shredded shapes. it was boring dry sliced/chopped meat. The brisket was sliced very thin, cold, tough and had minimal smoke ring, bark etc. The sauce on both was too sweet for my taste. The sides were mediocre. The mac n cheese a bit too watery, tasting more of black pepper than cheese and the potato salad dry and bland. It all came with a dry toasted little dinner roll. Service was minimal, the guy at the podium seemed annoyed to take my order. Order and pay in advance at the podium and the food brought to your table. No one asked me how anything was after the food was brought. They have annoying tiny flimsy horrible plastic cutlery. I would avoid returning just to never have to use those awful plastic forks again. I may try the ribs  someday but am in no rush and certainly wont go out of my way for it."

I was heading toward Spring Mountain through the south off ramp from the I-15 flyway to get my pho sesh when I realized that Rollin' Smoke was right off Highland Drive.  I don't know about y'all, but there is only one thing I do in this industrial area at involves poles and minimal clothing, so yeah....great place to put a BBQ establishment!\n\nI decided to go with something not too heavy, not knowing that a light meal here is equivalent to a light meal in Hawaii...no such things as smeediums here.  The sandwiches offer a check in discount to include some dessert as well.  I ended up saving mine after being more than satisfied following my meal.\n\nI opted for the Outlaw, for those that know, you know.  It comes with a brisket burger, deep fried onion crisps, there very own BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese on a lightly toasted bun and topped with some pickles and peppers.  Additionally, I made it a meal and added fried okra on the side.  \n\nThe meal came out rather quickly, considering that there were other patrons that were there before me, but have not yet gotten their dishes...and when their dishes did come out, it wasn't anything huge or extravagant.  So note to self, burgers and sandwiches come with the quickness.\n\nHowever, there is something about burgers that in now way humanly possible can fit into anyone's mouth, no matter how much you smash it down by hand.  I had to cut the bad boy into 4's in order to get it down without getting cited for indecency.  Kinda like getting a salad from a place that serves it on the smallest petrie dish ever constructed...I never seemed to ever get the logic in that.  But seriously, I'd rather complain about my meal being way over sized versus being a meal for an action figure.  \n\nOne thing I noticed though, they do not ask how you would like your burger, meaning that it comes standard as what looked to be medium rare plus, but not quite well.  It was moist and flavorful, but started to toughen up towards the end when it cooled off.  The Okra was on point and the BBQ is a nice compliment.  \n\nThe decor is like most BBQ joints that is accustomed to getting thrashed following a nice serving, evidenced by the whole paper towel rolls at each table.  There is no sense getting all done up if you are there to get dirty.  Yet, there was three flat screens playing three different ESPN channels, always a good sign.  The place appears to stick to it's Arkansas roots and has the Razorback Fight Song posted on the wall in the extended dining room.\n\nWhat rubbed me the wrong way was that I dropped a few bucks in the tip bucket right in front of the waiter, and he did not even acknowledge it.  That was disturbing since I actually clean up after myself pretty well.  I almost felt like sticking my hand back in the bucket like I was fishing for catfish, but oh well, I may be making too big a deal about it. \n\nI definitely want to come back to try the ribs and other offerings, so if its BBQ you want, this is the place to be."

In this case, I just HAVE to rave about this place even if it has more than enough reviews. The stars it dawns are definitely earned. If you love meat or Southern food, you can't go wrong here. I've had my fair share of meat experience and Rollin Smoke BBQ is high on that list. \n\nThe Food: \"Pit Special\" - $20 + tax\nYou receive 4 meats of your choice and 4 sides plus a drink. Portions are pretty big although I'm on the smaller side (4'10, 90lb) so an average build will definitely not leave hungry. I got the brisket, spare ribs, hot link, pork, potato salad, corn nuggets, Mac n cheese, and lastly corn bread. The meat was delicious, some bits were dry but nothing too bad, mostly moist and falling off the bone. Cooked well with a little pink in the brisket and ribs, subtle smoky flavor, and had a slice of bread to cushion the goodies. The corn nuggets remind of corn muffins I've had growing up in the Philippines (corns bits, crunchy bread) so I loved them but it might be a hit or miss for others. The corn bread is TO DIE FOR. Soft, moist, amazing flavor. Boyfriend had to promise me that we'd take some home when we leave Vegas back to LA - it's just that good. Can't vouch for the other two sides since I was too full to try them and I don't want to review it non-fresh. 5/5\n\nAtmosphere: Spacious considering the location. Has outdoor seating and a private party room to the side. Couple flatscreens to entertain you. Steel tables - easy to clean and sanitize. No napkins, just a huge roll of paper towel since you're bound to get down and dirty. Interesting mural of people on the wall and mascot merch scattered around. All in all, eating there was good. 3/5\n\nCustomer Service: You order and pay at the front then seat yourself. Cashier was nice enough, not super welcoming but helped me out with recommendations and they were all hits :) Although she did accidentally charge me extra on the 4th side (put as separate from the Pit Special) coming out to $25 instead, no biggie if it's not a repeat mistake. I only saw 3 staff on the floor: main cashier and the other two switching off delivering food and checking up on customers. The one guy was very nice and welcoming! 4/5 \n\nDefinitely recommend this place."

We got the brisket, pork, and 2 spare ribs for $13.99. Oh it was divine! The meat on the spare ribs just slips right off of the bone, and the pulled pork was just juicy and full of that smokey flavor.\n\nThe owner conversed with us for a bit, and based on his choice of decor in the place, you can tell hes an Arkansas fan. He was super humble and couldn't stop being grateful for all the Yelpers who had Yelped about this place. He also helped us with making choices. With a party of two he suggested the trio plate and the pulled pork sandwich if we wanted to have variety since the plates were more than enough to share. We chose beans and mac and cheese as our sides, and I tell you it was also just as good and homemade tasting as the meats! He also told us a little bit about the process in which they smoke the meats in their smoker right behind the restaurant, and smokes it for 16 hours (no wonder it's so good!). He wanted give Las Vegas a taste of good old Arkansas bbq, and he sure did!\n\nWhen you check in you get a free pie with your meal! I got the sweet potato, ala mode of course! Super delish, and a must try. I will see you soon. Hands down one of my favorite places to eat."

Right outside are two or three picnic tables (the kinds you'd see in the park), and on the door there is a menu for you to look at. In the room where you order there are a few more picnic tables, menu is along the back wall and the cash register is in front. The lines can get very long, but thats because a lot of people have a billion questions like WHAT DO I GET?!? WHAT'S GOOD!??!\n\nYes, lines are long but they get the food out pretty quickly. \n\nHot link is super spicy IMO. So if you like spicy, then go for it! Best bang for your buck would be any of the platters. My bf and I got the rib platter or something like that, it came with spare ribs, pork ribs and beefy ribs along with a side of your choice and a piece of bread. It was about $30, and the tray of food gets brought out to wherever you're sitting. Make sure you listen for your name. When I saw the platter I thought... meh, nothing special, presentation isn't great, just seems like a bunch of burnt meat piled on top of each other. BOY, was I wrong! Don't eat the beefy ribs FIRST because they are SOOOOO good. Everything just falls right off the bone. Save that for last! The spare ribs and pork ribs aren't bad either but, seriously if you had to pick just ONE thing off the menu, go for the beefy ribs. \n\nAdd some Alabama (?) sauce to that and it'll be like a party in your mouth. Also, I'm not a huge fan of banana pudding but the one here is delicious."

I like how affordable the menu is for the quality of food that you get. For $7.99 I got a \"Smoked Brisket Sandwich\" and for a few bucks more I made it a combo which included a side and a drink. I also added an additional side of \"Cheezy Mac & Cheese\" to my order. The brisket is smoked for 18 hours and is the best brisket I have had in town. The meat has such great flavor! When it comes to flavor the beans have it and like the brisket, the beans here are the best I've had in town. The macaroni and cheese was very good too. I'm not the type to eat meat off of the bone, but I did try a rib and I enjoyed every bite! So tender and flavorful! For dessert I had \"Banana Pudding\" priced at $3.99 and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. \n\nInside is clean and smells like heaven. So does the parking lot where you can on most days see the man himself outside smoking up some of the tasty meats they offer here. If you want to eat at home they offer a variety of party packs. They will even come to your home and bring their own grills and smokers to cater your event. Call them to find out about the packages they have and pricing. I am going to definitely keep the catering in mind for the future!"

We decided to give this place a try given the great reviews.  Location, we are talking about a dark street next to a gentleman's club akin to uber hole in the wall.  Only in Vegas!\n\nSo we were greeted at the door by a taxidermed hog and in front of us in line were three police officers... My thoughts-heck yah we were in for something good!\n\nCustomer service was top notched.  I ordered the 1/2 rack baby backs ($17.99) and a pound of the brisket ($10.99).  Floored that sides were not included as with typical BBQ spots, which makes the pricing on the expensive side.  \n\nBaby backs came out and the color was a rich coffee grind black and just brilliant.  I was expecting some excellent bark.  But, oh Romeo, alas it was not meant to be!   There was no texture to the bark although the meat did fall off the bones.  The dry rub was mehhhh.   The three sauces had a more watery consistency than traditional BBQ sauces, which is absolutely fine.  There were three varieties - mama sweet, house, and BBQ.  The house had a nice balance between sweet and vinegar and was our favorite.  The brisket had what amounted to a peppercorn rub.  They love the peppercorn at this place. Perhaps it was the end of the night, but it came out very dry.   We ended up not eating most of it it, which was a shame.   \n\nWhile dining, we eavesdropped on a conversation.  Apparently this is Rick's (of Pawn Star fame) favorite spot and he and Rollin teamed up to open another spot in Rick's strip center by his pawn shop.   Well, sounds like Rick is rollin in the dough with his Rollin location, which we will check out next time we are in town.\n\nOverall 3.5 stars. Not good enough to round to 4 though considering we've had so much better nationwide."

My husband isn't big on Carolina sauce, but he must've used half of the bottle while we ate. It was that good! I could've eaten a gallon of the Mac 'n' cheese all by myself. Which is a good sign because I'm very picky about Mac 'n' cheese.  I also could've eaten a gallon of greens, they were perfect!  There was so much food, I gave my leftovers to my brother. I think he may have finished them in the middle of the night.  Another thing I liked about this place was how friendly the staff was. Good food AND good customer service? Yes, please! Dusty was such a gracious person, I wanted to hang out with him and talk BBQ for the rest of the night.  \n\nWe were a little nervous when we saw a line out the door, but once we finished eating, we understood why.

You can tell the meat is done right, rubbed with spices and cooked low and slow for many hours in a hardwood smoker, not just brushed with liquid smoke and baked in an oven. Chef Tim promised a special sample of the pulled pork next time.  Very friendly staff loves to talk about the food."

Big mistake,not because it was not delicious, but because it was way too much food.  I started with beef rib, pork ribs, hotlink, mac n cheese,greens, and somehow they threw a piece of fried catfish on my plate too.  Everything was awesome, especially the beef rib, very meaty and smokey.\nThe only problem was that the link was not very hot both in heat and spice. I also had the fried shrimp and hushpuppies (I asked them to half the normal order for me cuz I was so full,  they said no problem)\nI finished with sweet potato pie and carmel cake. ohhh and i even asked them for a glass of milk to wash it down.  Not bad, not bad all!"

It isn't quite fall off the bone but nonetheless it is very tasty. The prices aren't too bad either and the quality of the food puts it above Famous Dave's.\nThe baked bean sides is about average but the macaroni and cheese is quite creamy and smooth.

The macaroni and cheese isn't bad, it is simply different.\n\nThe portions unfortunately aren't large for a two meat combo.\n\nThe service here is excellent with a friendly staff that is attentive and kind.\nThe decor here also is neat as it represents the hole-in-the-wall kind of grimy joint.\n\nI would eat here again."

The intoxicating smell of authentic bbq smokiness gave my sense of smell a run for its money and my hope was that my taste buds would follow along in happiness. I was so pleasantly surprised as the ribs, pulled pork, brisket and chicken arrived at our table. We ordered the four meat, three side combo to be able to try a little bit of everything. The sides we picked included the jalapeno cole slaw, bbq beans, mac and cheese and an extra side of dirty Vegas rice and cornbread. You know you've come to the right spot when everything you try is finished with an mmmm sound, a smile and a look of agreeable satisfaction to the person you are dining with. Just to describe a few, the brisket had an intense flavorful smoke on it you could see and was tender and delicious. The ribs were perfectly large and full of rich meat with a sweet intense spice rub. The jalapeno cole slaw was crunchy, a little spicy and had just enough dressing without drowning it. The mac and cheese was the perfect cheese sauce to noodle ratio with noodles cooked just right without drying out the dish. The cornbread was cooked perfectly,  sweet and salty with a warm layer of melted butter on the bottom that made it a little more guilty of being just so good. We look forward to going back and letting our friends know this is where they can find the best bbq in town. Thanks for bringing great bbq to Vegas!"

Pretty small dining area so tables can be difficult to et; by its ok to share with others; and there's also an outside seating area.  We tried the spare ribs, baby back ribs, chopped brisket, 1/4 chicken, mac and cheese and yams. All were fantastic. Although the next time I will definitely try the pork and hot links to confirm everything on the menu is great. One side note is that the baby back ribs were better and had more meat than the spare ribs. I will definitely be back."

They even give locals a 10% discount which is a plus in my book. There is an overflow area to provide additional seating which is almost always being utilized due to how busy they usually are. We try to order something new every time we come, but we always order the Burnt Ends, and the creamed corn nuggets. The reason for only giving them 4 stars is because they don't offer fresh brewed Iced Tea. They have the fountain type that tastes terrible. Just my opinion, but I just feel like a barbecue restaurant should take the additional steps to brew the iced tea in house."

Excellent dry rub and smoked to perfection. The brisket and baby backs are my favorite. The baby backs are melty tender in the middle and nice and jerky like on the ends.  The brisket is comparable to Rudy's and Blacks BBQ in TX - some of the best I've had. SUPER nice folks and a family run business. Location kinda sucks but it just adds to the true BBQ ambiance.

Round 1: ribs, 2 orders of hot links, pulled pork, 2 orders of brisket with the jalape\u00f1o cole slaw, kicken beans, mashed potato casserole and potato salad.\n\nREVIEW: meat was all tasty except for pulled pork was incredibly dry. Took a lot of extra bbq sauce to enjoy. The hot links are sure tasty with just the right amount of spice. We LOVED the kicken beans that were slightly sweet and savory -- Mmmm! The jalape\u00f1o cole slaw is unique and one to at least give a try. \n\nRound 2: chicken, 2 rib ends, ribs (again) and sides of fried okra, corn nuggets and onion straws. The chicken was juicy but came smothered in sauce which I don't care for. Rib ends were crunchy and had true smoke flavor. The corn nuggets are AMAZING with a sweet inside and perfectly crisp outside. The fries okra came with a side of sauce that complemented it well (sort of a Raising Cane's creamier sauce). The onion straws were average but tasted good.\n\nLuckily for them the 2nd round is smaller (less wastage). We left smelling like smoke and were super stuffed. We are not sure if we will give it another shot or not but we can say that we have been there."

This place is great, but I did take off a star for no table service, they just bring out your order. Now back to the important part--THE BBQ. Outstanding  covers it quite well. I got the Trio, the brisket, the thinner slices were juicy and smoky, the one thick slice was a little tough and dryer, not sure why. Ribs were meaty and good with the bbq sauce applied, which was a little thin for my taste, but flavorful. The sauce brought out more flavor, but flavor dropped off alot with no sauce, but still good though. And finally the hot link, I think WOW covers it. A lot of flavor, right amount of heat and perfect snap. As for the sides, beans were great, potato salad just OK, could have cooked potatoes a few minutes longer, were just under crunchy, but flavor was good. Overall absolutely will go back, but Famous Daves ribs are still better, not sure why, will have to try both again and report back."

There are large smokers in the parking lot which is originally what drew our attention to the place.  Usually we find our gems from Yelp, but this time it was a drive-by (or I should say that I find places on Yelp as the bf is in the food industry and like many industry people has a baseless grudge against Yelp).  \n\nSince i am not a huge meat eater what I really care about are the sides.  The sides were amazing.  Which is great because a lot of times at BBQ places the focus is on the meat only and the sides are kind of an after thought.  The peach cobbler was insanely good.  And I have been dreaming about the loaded mashed potatoes since I had them.  I also had the mac n cheese.  The waiter (who I assume is also one of the owners since he thanked us about 20 times for coming in) recommended the mac n cheese.  Listen if you can't execute a delicious mac n cheese you should throw yourself off a bridge.  It's macaroni, cheese, cream and bake.  It was really good but I was more impressed with the other sides that are nonstandard and were amazing.  On my next visit I plan on trying the banana pudding.    \n\nIt does have its advantages and disadvantages, depending on who you are.  It is right down the street from the Rhino - a disadvantage to me, but an advantage to any dirt-bags.  The parking lot is kind of sketchy, again a disadvantage to me, but like home to dirt-bags.  The BBQ sauce is really peppery.  I personally like milder sauces and I am not a big meat eater, but I could still appreciate the execution of the sauce and that it was made in house.  I am not used to eating smoked meat so was a little concerned that the chicken looked pink, but the bf explained to me that that is how smoked meat should look that has actually been smoked in a smoker and not just marinated in smoke \"flavor\".  All the meat was very tender, but the sauce was a little too intense for me.  That being said I was more than happy to stick with the sides."

Plain and simple, the brisket and pulled pork were delicious.  They come pretty sauce-less.  Don't fuck it up by throwing 2 gallons of BBQ sauce on them, kids.  I mean, the sauce is legit, but the flavor of the smoke in the meat is amazing.  The jalapeno slaw wasn't super jalapeno-y, which is good.  You could tell there was a kick, but it didn't overpower it.  The greens would have made Popeye's eyeballs explode.  Mine were boss-level.  I do dig greens, though, so I might be biased...\n\nAll in all, 6 meals for my coworkers for $77, plus tip, was definitely worth it."

The pork was tender with no hard ends. It had plenty of moisture but not heavy rendered fat. The smoke flavor was good but not overwhelming. The brisket had good smoke penetration and the pink ring didn't overpower the flavor. Just the right smoke. Finally the hot link was hot enough without canceling out the flavors. \n\nOverall well played. Worth the wait. The sauce on the table had flavor with just a little heat. The location has zero parking and the dinning area is challenging. \n\nI still love this and would rate it up with the like if the Salt Lick in Driftwood TX. A must visit."

            "review": "Rollin smoke is as close to southern smoke as you will get west of the Colorado River.\n\nLet's get to the good stuff\n\nMeats\n\nSpare Ribs: The highlight of the meal. If you're evenly in love with spare ribs as much as you are with baby back ribs, then I suggest to just go with these. Teeeender *TJ Detweiler voice* added with the taste of the meat will make you laugh at your visits to Bludso's or Phil's. 4.5/5\n\nBaby Ribs: I want my baby back baby back baby back..these were less impressionable, maybe because I had them second? But don't get me wrong they were still very good! Fall off the bone and tasty but your stomach will tell you it was only a fair investment and you should of \"spared\" it some space. 4/5\n\nHot Links: The perfect meat side for my rib meal, yes I get meats as a side to my meat. The taste wasn't as \"hot\" as you would think, then again my mom raised me with a molcajete. Tasty to dip in your favorite sauce. 4/5\n\nSauces..Ask them for a sample tasting of them before you make a decision of such high importance\n\nSides \n\nCorn Bread: My relationship with corn bread has always been 50/50. I approve of this one. Soft at the bite, taste home made, the style of it was made to be had with this meal. 4/5\n\nBBQ Beans: These are my babies when it comes to BBQ meals, there was a hint of flavor that elevated it past average but nothing that I'd recommend in bold if you're not such a fan of beans to begin with. 3.7/5\n\nWaffle Fries: The side I dipped in the least. Missing a good seasoning, lacked a crisp taste. 2/5\n\nPotato Salad: In a league of it's own. Someone was a side hog with this one but the 2 spoons of it were very good. Hard to break down the flavor but Javier approved. 4.25/5\n\nDessert:\n\nBanana Pudding: I'm so sad I was too full to indulge in this the way my inner child would have liked. But this swirled me back to my cubbie days when I thought snack packs were the bomb. The nilla cookies added to this only makes it sound that much better, right? And that's because it is. 4.5/5\n\nWoah, looks like I guinea pigged it for you.\n\nThis all was not a bad price either, considering Vegas is Vegas. It was $40 something, The only downward arrow is that the sides are uber small, meaning it's a portion for one. Order 2 of the ones you think you may like the most if you're meal sharing.     \n\nService:\n\nThis was a to go order. It was ready in the said time, they sent me off with sample tastings of their sauces, their customer service enthusiasm was meh. I'd say they're their BBQ beans equivalent in this department. 3.7/5\n\nMy Final Say\n\nWe all know somewhere in Kansas City or Austin there lays an establishment that is probably better than Rollin Smoke, but regionally speaking, I have not met a close competitor to this place in the West. Let that serve as my 5 star justification. \n\nI recommend coming here, unless you're a part of Hank Hill's blood line, I am sure you will be satisfied with your meal here.\n\nTo Whom It May Concern\n\nI apologize for lack of pictures, I turned into Joey Chestnut one bite in and forgot to take more."

There wasn't a lot of people there so I guess the grill was not kicking out hot food. I guess they just gave us what was leftover hanging around in the kitchen. I ordered the beef ribs because most reviews said to get them and they were really fatty. Rolling Smoke needs to understand the average customer had good bar b que in their lives and know what to look for when eating it. I say that to say, I have a strong feeling the meet I was eating was not made that day. I think the meat was leftover from the prior day because it had a very older texture to it. The links were good but it is not hard to cook a link. The chicken was ok and probably would have been better if it was served hot. The best thing we had was the kick ass beans and cornbread. \n\nLastly, I been in Vegas long enough to know that most of these restaurants have good days and bad days. Most places, you are not going to get good food unless the establishment is crowded and they are forced to keep making hot food. I went to Rolling Smoke when it was not that crowded so I believe they just gave me the meat that was cooked a day prior. No way that meat was cooked that day. I think they didn't want to waste money by throwing it away. In my opinion, restaurants should never risk a customer by serving old food that should be thrown out instead. We are coming there for an experience and we are paying top bucks for it. \n\nI have been to restaurants and had a fantastic meal, just to go back to the same restaurant and have a horrible meal. Therefore, I will try Rolling Smoke one more time. I will chalk it up as one bad experience hoping to get the experience most people on this board received."

We live in Las Vegas and have gone to many BBQ places in town and of course I grew up in the Carolinas and lived in Texas too , so I know my BBQ ! Well , it is good but I didn't think it was great as others do . The meat is definately smokey which alot of places here don't seem to do . I got the 3 meat plate and my son got the big burger . The burger was cooked perfectly and was good , but I have to say the Famous Daves Ultimate Brisket Burger is better . Now , the ribs here are more moist and flavorful . I like the pulled pork a little better here too and I like the Southern Girl sauce better than any of the others . The BBQ beans tasted a little old and not good and I love BBQ beans ! The sausage was ok , but again Dave's beats theirs . The corn nuggets were good and I don't know anyone else around here that serves them . It would have been nice to have corn bread in my platter than the one piece of bun underneath that was oily . All in all , I think this is a good place and will probably try again and they also offer a locals discount . The lady at the counter was really friendly which I appreciate since I am also in the service industry it is nice to talk with people who aren't just doing their job and go next in line .

I looked on Yelp and voila, there it was, Rollin Smoke Barbeque.\n\n We came last night around 9 PM and it wasn't busy but there were people there enjoying their dinners. You order and pay at the counter/booth and they bring the food out to you. I got the beef brisket sandwich with a side of okra and my boyfriend got the trio with ribs, brisket, and pork with a side of mac and cheese. My sandwich was delicious! I ate it with a fork because it was so stuffed with meat that I knew it would spill out of the bun once I had it in my hands. The okra was good too. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about his trio of meat! He loved every bit of it. \n\nIt's a small, simple restaurant located down the street from Spearmint Rhino. The person who took our order was sooo friendly! My boyfriend was having a hard time deciding on what he wanted and the guy offered several suggestions, even stating which ones were his mother or grandmother's recipes. He even told us how he and his brother got started in the barbeque business. \n\nI wonder if they've ever been featured on one of those travel or food network shows? Because if not then they really should be!"

We are from Texas, so we know BBQ.  I had the outlaw burger which was HUGE!  We should have just split it.  It had almost a meatloaf texture, but it tasted smoked and I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  My husband had a full rack of baby back ribs and they were as big as the beef ribs we are used to.  They were fall off the bone tender and we couldn't finish them.  We are big eaters but after this lunch, we skipped dinner.  The owners friend was the cook and he came out and talked with us.  He was super helpful on giving us pointers on what to order and what else to do while we were in town.  Everyone was nice and the food was great.  (it's three weeks later and I'm wishing we could go back for more)."

Outside was super crispy, and inside was sweet and moist with little bits of corn kernels.  This item definitely sets this place apart from other BBQ places.  The house made habanero paste sauce was also excellent.  \n\nMy wife and I ordered the trio meat combo with pulled brisket, 1/4 lb chicken, and hot links.  The brisket was juicy with a nice smoked flavor; chicken was tender and flavorful; and hot links were spicy with a nice snap to them.  I put some Carolina vinegar on the brisket which helped cut down some fat and added a refreshing flavor to the meat.  The house BBQ sauce was tasty although a bit watery so I mixed some of the habanero paste to thicken it up.  They tasted pretty good together.  The sweet BBQ sauce, which tasted like honey mustard, was also pretty good, and went well with the hot links.\n\nService was friendly.  Chef and some of the staff members walked around greeting people and making sure everyone was doing ok.  \n\nSeating is set up in a family style with picnic benches and tables.  \n\nThis will definitely be one of the stops we make whenever we are in Vegas.  We actually walked over here from The Trump Hotel despite it being in a sketchy area.  It was fine in the day but I probably would be too scared to walk here at night."

There are not many dedicated bbq places in town, so there's not much competition for RS BBQ, hence \"Best BBQ in Vegas\"  and the anointed darling amongst the Yelp community. \n\nThe bbq does have a nice smoke ring I give it that, thin pink line, crisp crust, easily pulls off the bone. The bbq hickory smoke aroma in the air is intoxicating and draws  you into this place!  Taste wise it's good, not great. I've had better bbq with better spice rub mix and sauces.  \n\nFirst impression was a hit for the ribs, a miss for the brisket. It was not as moist like our favorite place. Our recent returns here have been good. Although sometimes the ribs are a tad dry. It could be because we got the ones left in the warming trays longer. \n\nThey did a nice job expanding the dining area. As far as picnic bench seating; it's great if you are with a large party and you take up the majority of the table. But when you have to share a table with strangers that have no table manners or have poor hygiene, it puts a damper on my dining experience. \n\nThe price they charge for what you get is great! That is always the highlight of conversations I've had with other diners and why another reason this place rates high on here. It's cheap! For two meat two side combo meal under $10,  For the amount they charge for decent bbq there's no reason to leave here disappointed. That's why I don't mind coming here."

I was confused for many years thinking that these three were the best of Las Vegas in terms of BBQ, guys listen closely.  ROLLIN SMOKE, BEST BBQ IN VEGAS!!!\n\nLocation: Its funny when i tell people where this place is located since its in that desolate strip on highland near the Spearmint Rhino. Initially people are turned off, \"you're taking me where?\"  \"Han take me back\"  but once they have the food they go, \"omg... Han pleaseeee take me back here\"\n\nService: Service here is great.  They try their best to get the customers orders as fast as they can despite being busy during the peak hours of the day.  Another big plus about this place is that the chef will come out when he has time to ask his customers how the food is and a brief history of the restaurant.  Nothing like the person who makes the food to really care about what the customers think, bravo!\n\nFood:  You really can't find anything bad to choose from but i'd avoid the brisket (a bit dry when i had it last time i was here)  Their famous outlaw burger is literally the size of your head.... like a mondo burger (good burger reference).  So juicy and literally will leave you so full, you won't be able to eat till tomorrow.\n\nBBQ: BEEF RIBS!!! that is all.  Literally picked it up and the whole piece fell off.  St louis ribs are also very delicious and juicy.  Meat is so succulent and the juices that exude out of the meat is parallel to wringing a wet sponge.  I might just pass out from describing how good the ribs are.\n\nOverall. Just go here!"

It's got a \"dive bar\" feel thanks to it's location and the old, weathered building it's in. But, that just seems to solidify their reputation as the town's best barbecue. No legitimate barbecue place could occupy a clean,modern building, right? For my first visit I had to try the rib platter ($22.99). With fall-off-the-bone tender baby back ribs with a good crust/bark and smokey flavor, thick and meaty spare ribs, and a massive, charred and fatty beef rib, this was a great option to try multiple proteins. For a side, I went with the mac 'n cheese. Made from elbow pasta and sitting in a thick, creamy cheese sauce topped with cheddar, it only served as a speed bump in my road to devouring the barbecue. I'll agree with many others in saying this is the city's best 'cue, at least from what I've tried so far. Locals get a 10% discount."

I usually prefer a moloasses based bbq sauce with little to no vinegar flavor. There sauce was a great combo of both and add it to the rub on the meat its like a match made in hell at high heat cooked to perfection. \n\nI was in vegas with my father so we split a half rack of ribs and the meatloaf which is a looks like meatloaf but thats about it because they fill it with pork and different bbq favorites that take it to the next level. \n\nGreat spot off the strip, went on a weeknight no lines, parked in front, great food and experience.

It's not fancy and you may have a decent wait in line to order but the food is delicious. The burnt ends, baby back ribs, pulled pork, rib tips and brisket were our favorites. The chicken, hot links and fried shrimp also received high marks. As far as the side orders, we all loved the corn nuggets and Mac and cheese, however everything was awesome! The desserts included banana pudding, blueberry cobbler and root beer floats! Our sincere compliments to the entire crew of Chef Damon, Chef Christian, Moises, Brenda, Lizelle and James Monticello who went above and beyond to make our experience so awesome! Keep up the great work Rolling Smoke BBQ! We will be back and wholeheartedly recommend this hidden gem!"

I order the outlaw burger with my sister and my mom gets some pulled pork. The owner comes out and sits at our table and apologizes to me saying they just ran out of an ingredient of the outlaw but asks if it's okay if he \"hooks me up.\" Knowing there's nothing on the menu that could let me down I'm completely okay with it. He comes back with extra sides and twice the food I was originally receiving. Everything was amazing.\nFrom the food to the customer service. I'd go in depth of how good everything he brought out was was but it would make this review too long to get through. Long story short; This remains my favorite local BBQ joint and it'll be yours too."

My wife and I split a combo plate (I forget what it was called) so we could try everything. So, from best to less best:\n\nBrisket: Top-notch. Moist, flavorful, well-smoked. A delight.\nRibs: Split verdict. I thought they were great, wife finds beef ribs a bit too chewy but admitted the flavor was great.\nHot Links: Excellent. Spicy and flavorful.\nPulled Pork: A bit dry and not up to the standard set by the other meats. That said, there sure weren't any leftovers.\n\nSauce: Pretty ordinary, really. Not bad, though, and the meats don't need its help, so it actually works pretty well in a supporting role.\n\nBeans: Fantastic. Almost like a bowl of chili. You could make a meal out of these alone.\nPotato Salad: Maybe the best ever. Bacon really does make everything better.\nCole Slaw: Unique and original, but didn't really work for us. The only real misfire in an otherwise exceptional meal.\n\nThis is a really good barbecue joint, bordering on greatness. When you factor in its unexpected location, it probably deserves five stars. Barbecue snobs that we are, we just can't quite grant that ranking when comparing it to Kansas City's best. Guaranteed, next time we're in Vegas, we'll be back. Friendly folks and good food bring us back every time."

Owner made an exception and gave us 1/2 brisket and 1/2 pulled pork. Homemeade BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy, the brisket was moist and very tender. Tasted great with some coleslaw on a pun. Pulled pork was a little dry but tasted fine. The ribs melted off the bone and were extremely flavorful. Perfect place to get some local food at a very good price.

The burger (which is HUGE)  is made of brisket and is topped with cabbage slaw, fried onion strings, chipotle aioli, lettuce and tomato and was perfectly cooked. The beef ribs come with two bones and are Flintstone size. They have the perfect amount of char and completely fall off the bone. The greens are cooked with brisket instead of bacon or ham and are well worth adding on as a side if not included with your meal choice. The cornbread was a little sweet for our taste but certainly good. Prices are very reasonable. As new residents of Las Vegas, we will definitely be back."

The Beef Ribs were like freakin' brontosaurus bones. Huge ribs, tons of meat, perfect bark, excellent charred rub, and juicy as all get out. Perfect combo of meat and fat, and a sure gut buster considering the slab consists of only four ribs. One order of chicken wings was similar to that of about two full chickens. Served as five pieces, but each is dished up as a whole wing and drum. Judging by the size, the chickens are prehistoric, much like those rearing the beef ribs (freaking monsters). The Rib Tips were fine...great sauce, rub, perfectly smoked and charred. Served as 8 pieces, it was a filler-upper like everything else. GO THERE HUNGRY!

Maybe I just played unlucky and ordered them at the wrong time. I like their sauce quite a lot, it's tart, not too thick and spicy enough that one is not tempted to overdo it.\n\nI called at 8:40 PM last night, although they were closed Chef Tim was gracious enough to let me pick up 2 lbs, of sliced brisket after hours. The brisket was excellent, juicy with a very dark crust and just enough fat. Had just received a selection of sauces from Franklin BBQ in Austin,TX; favorite of Texas cult BBQ and uber hip Austinites, wanted to do a taste test immediately.\n\nI cannot believe that I drove by this place for 6 months before I stopped, such is the sad state of BBQ (and Mexican Food) in Las Vegas.

The wait was an hour to get our food. People who ordered after us got served before us, which was maddening. The staff brings your food, but that is all. \n\nFood: Big portions! Had that good BBQ flavor and they had 2 different sauces you could use. \n\nOverall: Staff could be a little friendlier and more helpful with ordering, maybe implement a seating system, and invest in some signage for the street that is lit for when its dark."

There were so many choices on the menu, my head was spinning. So my husband and I decided to go with the pit special so we could try as many meats and sides as possible. I'm just going to say you can't go wrong with any of the BBQ fare. The ribs, brisket, pulled pork, hot links- all amazing! The hot links were nice and spicy and all the other meat was super tender and delectable. \nThe beans were a great side- thick and chunky with big pieces of pork mixed throughout. Yum yum. The potato salad had crispy pieces of bacon on top which launched it into a new level of awesome-ness. The fried okra was perfectly breaded and fried. No extra salt required. The mac and cheese just seemed like a dud next to all the other sides, so I'd skip that one if possible.\nAs for the dessert- the peach cobbler was too much peach and not enough cobbler. You could tell that they used a canned peach to make it and it was just not doing it for me. The peach cobbler wasn't the best, but maybe i'll try the banana pudding next time."

On my first visit I had the brisket sandwich and the rib combo which comes with their spareribs, baby back ribs, and beef ribs.\n\nI'm a Texas BBQ snob and although I cant get my Texan BBQ fix, Rollin Smoke is about the best you'll get in Vegas and they do their beef ribs perfect.....falls off the bone, tender, juicy, and so delicious you'll be in a meat coma.  \n\nSpeaking of meat coma, I was talked into getting their AYCE the last 2 times for $25. This is the best value because you can literally get EVERYTHING on the menu but their portions for regular items are huge.   For AYCE, i typically get alot of beef ribs, get some brisket, and catfish.  Their catfish is perfectly fried with a nice crust and I squeeze a little lemon on it and pour a little hot sauce and i devour every bite of it.\n\nTheir desserts, cobblers are great too.  AND this place is open till 1:30 on fri/sats.  Also good for groups - came with a group of 10-12 people and they sat us all easy.  This place is a locals gem and i often see tourists finding their way here.  Def one of Vegas's best!"

Wait BBQ?\n\nFriend: They even have this amazing short person stripper.\n\nMe: What? Wait BBQ?\n\nI had to make this my first stop straight from the airport...and I am glad I did. I was lucky I hit them at an off hour as right after we ordered...the line went out the door!\n\nThe food: Lean baby back ribs that are thick, meaty, smokey, and flavorful. Brisket to die for....incredibly tender, smoke ring ladden...OMG....get a combo of the sliced and chopped. \n\nI would also recommend the burnt ends ( this is something not a lot of places offer). Tons of crunch, tons of flavor, and little fat.\n\nGreat sausage and great smoked chicken...but I would not waist stomach capacity on those two.\n\nThey offer four great sauces: I had the momma sweet delicious...get it, it is delicious and complex. I also had the sweet country girl....both complemented the meats...and are great to drip the rolls and bread in.\n\nSides that were outstanding were the bacon potato salad, the jalapeno coleslaw and mac and cheese. I would pass on the cornbread (tasted very pedestrian), corn poppers ( hard as rocks if they are to go), and Yams ( too sweet and syrupy).\n\nI was lucky enough to meet one of the owners and she was sweet as pecan pie and just  a nice person to talk to.......they care about what they serve and how they treat their customers and employees.....nice.\n\nIf you like bbq and your in veags this is the place...easy to get to from McCarran airport....and if your bored after the bbq...you can always watch a short person pole dance!!!!"

The decore is very, very simple.  When you enter i was greeted with a large menu on the wall, and a gentle men standing at a tall podium, I felt as if I was ordering from Bbq god, later found out that I was!! The food here was awesome I ordered a Trio: brisket perfect smoke and great seasoning. Pulled pork flavor was spot on yet a little dry, nothing a little sauce didn't fix.  Ribs were the best I have had in LV. A friend of mine had the outlaw burger and I tried a small bite.  Perfect balance of flavor, my only suggestion is to not over mix the ground meat, also mix the meat when it is really cold. The texture of the burger was off for a med/mid rare burger, really dense as if the meat was over worked, it was like meatloaf. Other then that, its worth the wait. This will now be the only place I will go for Bbq for a while.  GREAT JOB, R&S!"

I'm in the military, so I moved out here from NC almost 3 years ago, and in that amount of time I've never found any place that was up to par with what I considered good BBQ. Memphis isn't very good. Famous Dave's is okay. Lucille's is pretty decent, but for the drive to Henderson (and fairly high price), it's just not worth a regular trip. Then I got tip from a new friend (who was also a fellow North Carolinian) about a place that was a little off the beaten path but well worth it... Rollin Smoke Barbecue. So we decided to give it a try. That leads me to this moment, as I sit here with a full belly typing this review. My wife and I both had the pulled pork sandwich. Her sides were Mac & cheese and potato salad, mine were Mac & cheese and hush puppies. All of which were delicious. The meat was tender, the bbq sauce was delicious and had just a little bit of spice to it. All the sides were awesome. And we washed it all down with the only kind of tea that should exist... SWEET. Then to get our sweet tooth fix we shared some banana pudding that was amazing. Even as I stuffed my face I was studying the menu so I could plan my next visit. Rollin Smoke is the real deal. Great barbecue and extremely friendly staff. If you're a local or just passing through and you're looking for an authentic barbecue experience, Rollin Smoke is where it's at!"

So, if you like Arkansas BBQ, Louisiana, or Texas BBQ you will be in heaven.\n\nThey have beef ribs that are juicy and delicious.  Smoked 19 hours.  They have a rub on them and then you add BBQ sauce. The Pork ribs, chicken are very good too.  Haven't been able to find any food to complain about.  I get a little quiet when I am there enjoying the food so much.\n\nPeople have complained about cost to portion, but the portions are big enough for my husband to be stuffed and full most of the day.  Cost wise, it seemed reasonable for good quality BBQ to me and I will be back frequently.\n\nI tried the catfish and it has a crunchy cornmeal coating with and no weird after flavor you sometimes get with catfish.   I have had it twice now since it is so good.  Once in a basket and once as a poor boy sandwich.   Love it.  I can't decide which is my favorite the beef ribs or the catfish.\n\nThe sides I have tried are:  mac and cheese -flavor is good, but I prefer a baked thick cheese sauce over this one.\nHush puppies: pretty tasty\nCorn fritters:  tasty, the corn is inside a breading.   Being from Virginia I have some expectations that probably aren't normal or liked by many others.  I felt these were good, but a little blander than I like.   I enjoy the corn tucked into a spicy hush puppy myself\n\nHaven't had space for any desserts yet, but I will have to get some to go next time.  I am usually going somewhere else after.\n\nThey also will cook up a whole pig for parties.  Price varies depending on market price so call them.  Very cool.\n\nCan't wait to eat there again.   Also if you go early enough in the day they have a cool electrical store called Kiesub next door.   If you are tech oriented you will enjoy it."

They handled my huge order with ease.  We had brisket, beef ribs, baby backs, spare ribs, sausage, burnt ends, and chicken!! Everything was excellent. The brisket and burnt ends were devine!! The beef ribs were huge and tender as everyone loved the selection of meats that were put out. And then there were the sides. We had a pan of the bacon potato salad, a pan of the jalepeno cole slaw, a pan of the kickin beans, a pan of greens, a house salad as well as some candied yams. Just let me say that there was nothing left after the party as people went back for seconds and thirds! They will even do speacial orders on items not on the menu! I highly reccomend Rollin Smoke as the best BBQ In Vegas!!"

Usually a high rating place on Yelp can be suggestive, but the reviews truly do not lie.   Southern true cooked Mesquite BBQ is what this place is all about and when we got there they had a line a mike long going outside.  That can only suggest one thing: the food is excellent.  I was fortunate enough to be able to try the ribs, brisket, and corn taters.  All were very delicious and food came out very fast.\n\nMy only little quirk was the menu was too far away from the register to place your order and there was only one register for the long line.  Seating was very limited and the location is an off the wall spot, but that's kind of it's hidden gem.\n\nI loved the fact I left the joint smelling like Mesquite BBQ and that smell is very delightful.  When I got back to my office, everyone asked me where I went, because they could smell the BBQ smell.  Go see for yourself and you won't be disappointed."

I mean if this place was going to be as good as everyone said, then why isn't this place packed?\n\nBut we sat down and the guy was friendly and down home. I love a southern gentleman, they win me over every time. He told me that they were out of the beef ribs but if I wanted to wait 45 minutes that they would be ready. So I didn't want to wait 45 minutes and went with a meat platter. I got the brisket and st Louis ribs and hot links. Already told you about the brisket, the ribs I enjoyed too. They were tender and smokey and very flavorful. If I am being honest, then I would probably pass on the hot link. I think they were just bbq'ed too long for me. \n\nSo we got dessert with our yelp check in and I wasn't too sure that they would taste so good based on their appearance. We ordered banana pudding and peach cobbler. I would alone come for the peach cobbler but again, if I am being honest I would pass on the banana pudding.\n\nI love BBQ. It is just always so hard to find a good decent eats for BBQ in this town. But the quest for me has ended here. I rave about this place to everyone. \n\nThe BBQ sauce here is amazing too.

I thought he was taking a take out order.  Came to realize that he was the owner, now that is just not good customer service. That was the first reason it didn't deserve a five, then the next reason was that I came to look at the photos to see if we for what was in the photo since the owner was telling everyone including myself to yelp for him 4 and 5 only please.  He even said you can do it from your cell phone.  I told him then i saw you got 4.5 stars. i don't know if you get as much as some of the photos featured, for sure the burger was Hugh but the trio and such I am not sure.  The strike two was on one of the photos it said free dessert if you yelp, well when I ordered my blueberry a la mode he didn't give it to me for free or even mentioned it.  He has been there for a year and at this point as a business owner wouldn't you do this to get people to come back? Or suggest this place? Or even yelp for you?  What is 6.00 dessert? Strike three:  they didn't bring out all the right sides well I mean he said this it I had to tell him we still have a side of rings and an order of waffle fries.  This is the reason they got a three from me.  The food was delicious to everyone that went, the baby backs didn't seem to fall off Like the spare ribs.  The brisket fries were Huge and yummy.  The Brisket dog look great and I heard it was delicious.  I couldn't try it because I am not a fan of smoke burnt BBQ, there is Noy one kind of BBQ sauce and it was not my fav with the tangy taste.  I like the sweetness of BBQ sauce. I am also big on service even if the food is awesome for them to get a five.  In some cases no service is okay but it want because they were super busy and for god sake it was the owner not an employee.  Oh and the bathroom is weak, one single one and it doesn't flush well after you have been waiting, luckily it was not a number two for me.  The toilet paper just would flush...yikes. It is the worst feeling standing there trying and trying.   I am sure the owner will read this and make it a better experience for you future yelpers. Btw, the honey fried chicken was not that good, so stick to the BBQ, dud that is why you came right? I am a bread lover and the little buns were weak."

My group ordered the rib combo plate, so we got ribs, chicken and brisket. All of the meats were so well-cooked. You can also ask for the meats \"naked,\" which meant they only had a BBQ rub but no sauce, and then you can add your own sauce from the selection of BBQ sauces at the table. We did this because I was not sure which sauces would be spicy. The sides were pretty good as well, but the portions on those were somewhat small. We were also really impressed with their selection of beer on tap! They had a list beers, all from Colorado microbreweries, and we got to try some beers we hadn't heard of. Also, we were all super impressed with the friendly and helpful service we received. It was so fun!! This is definitely the place I recommend if you are looking for great BBQ in the Springs."

            "review": "Excellent BBQ, tucked away in an industrial-ish neighborhood.\n\nI wanted BBQ. Yelp led me to Rollin Smoke. We drove there. Upon arrival, I was somewhat skeptical, because this place is in a somewhat sketchy area. Surrounded by strip clubs, warehouses, and a few rundown places, it doesn't really look like the place you'd take your family. But when I got past that initial impression and walked inside, I knew I was in a good place.\n\nThe location is pretty small. There is seating out in front and two rooms of seating inside. Most of it is communal in style--just picnic-style tables with attached benches. The place is permeated with the smell of smoking meat. What a great smell! There are a number of good options on the menu.\n\nAs I do pretty much without fail at a BBQ joint that is new to me, I got a sample plate with some brisket and chicken. The combo comes with a few pieces of brisket, 1/4 of a chicken (a leg and a thigh), a piece of Texas toast, a couple of pickles, and a side. I got the green beans side (despite normally going for the BBQ beans) and ate that first. I was pretty impressed with just the green beans. They were fresh and crisp and were seasoned to perfection. Then I worked my way into the chicken. It was seasoned perfectly as well and cooked just right. It was nice and tender and delicious. I often skip the skin on chicken, but this was great stuff, and I ate it all. Finally, the star, the brisket. Brisket is the standard by which I measure any BBQ joint. This is excellent brisket. It's sliced to the right thickness. It's nice and tender and falls apart with just a little work with the fork. And it's delicious. With or without any added sauce, this stuff rocks!\n\nSpeaking of sauces, there are a few options. I went with the Arkansas version, which turned out to be pretty darn good. When I first squeezed some out of the bottle, I feared that it was too liquidy, but the consistency was great when put straight onto the brisket itself.\n\nMy friend got a brisket salad, and I ended up finishing it for her. It too was delicious. I'm not really a fan of romaine-based salads, but the greens and tomatoes were all fresh, the peppers were spicy, and the brisket was delicious on the salad as well.\n\nThere are a few options that are intriguing to me for when I visit in the future with a healthy appetite. The $35 all-you-can eat option is a rarity among BBQ joints. And the picture of the burger on the wall made the burger look like quite the challenge.\n\nThis is great BBQ, not just for Vegas, but in general."

You get a free dessert if you use yelp too so that's a plus. I also ordered the outlaw burger and was warned it takes about 15 minutes to make. I was okay with that until 35 minutes later it still had not come. The burger was amazing and I had only ordered a 1/2 pound of pulled pork and received well over a pound (I assume it was for the wait)  I ordered for two people and my name was the same as another patron so I'm assuming there was some confusion there. Which brings me to the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5. The ordering and service wasn't great, but It wasn't bad either and the food more than made up for it."

Looking at the good reviews for this place, my group and I decided to come to this place.  The place itself is small so try not to come during the rush for lunch because you won't find a place to sit.  What really did like right off the bat here is that they have a large smoker you can see by the side of the building as you walk in, and you can smell the smoke already! My group ordered a combination platter called The Pit and it came with spare ribs, brisket, sausage and pulled pork.  We also shared the outlaw burger, which eventually stole the show. The sausage had a mild smokey flavor but it was a little dry. Everything else was very moist and tender and had a good smokey flavor.  The pulled pork and brisket were very tender and flavorful and didn't need any sauce.  The ribs were a little tough to eat off the bone I   I thought, and I didn't get any extra spiciness from the rub. And when I tried to kick it up a noth by adding their bbq sauce, It didnt work.  Their bbq sauce is very bland.  It has no spiciness or tang or zing.  Just mildy dressed up tomatoe sauce. The best thing I tasted there was the OUTLAW BURGER.  The baddass big flavor patty, the onion strings, and the tangy mayo were awesome together.  My advice is to come for the Outlaw burge, pulled pork, and the brisket!"

The atmosphere feels like an outside picnic without being outside. They have outside tables if you do like being outside! I definitely recommend this place if you just want some fresh tasting BBQ in your mouth. The reason I give it a four star is only because they never refilled the ice machine.

We had the 5 meat sampler and famed Outlaw burger and both were incredible. \n\nI have experienced some joints that do a couple of meats well but fall short on others, this place is knocking it out of the park. Brisket was juicy, pork was tender, sausage had great flavor, and chicken was smoked just right. The ribs tasted fantastic but we're not as juicy as I like, again this was the sampler so I think a slab will be juicier.\n\nSides of Mac n cheese, hush puppies & bacon mashed potatoes were also delicious. With drinks total came to $45 for a family of 5. They do have 10% coupon on the website. Do not leave Vegas before trying Rollin Smoke!"

As soon as you pull into the parking lot, you can smell the meat and it makes you drool. We decided to share a pulled pork sandwich and the rib platter special that includes baby back ribs, spare ribs and beef rib. We thought the pulled pork sandwich was ok, but honestly it's an unusual pick for us, we both think they need veggies to lighten the sandwich up. But the rib platter was f'ing amazing. HOLY CRAP. This is some quality meat here folks. The meat isn't dripping in sauce so the flavors of the meat shine through. And holy cow, the beef rib is incredible. I had never tried it before but it is literally fall off the bone delicious. \n\nYou must check this place out!"

I haven't tried many here in Vegas, so I can't definitively say that they are the best, but I enjoyed my meal.\n\nFirst, don't come expecting anything fancy or close to it. While not a hole in the wall, it's pretty basic, picnic benches, wait in line to order your food (luckily, when we arrived, there was no wait, but there was a long one about midway through the meal), and a server will bring your food to you. You get your own drink (fountain drinks), plastic ware and plates. It's very close quarters, so people will be all around you while you eat. \n\nThe cashier was very sweet and a real jokester! She told us that they were out of everything but hot links and got a good laugh out of seeing my face drop! She reassured me that she was just kidding and we proceeded from there. \n\nMy friend and I decided to split the 5 meat, 3 sides platter ($27) and get an order of cornbread on the side. The platter comes with: chopped brisket, pulled pork, hot links, 1/4 chicken, and 2 ribs. Of everything, I liked the ribs best- they were tender and seasoned well. The hot links were spicy but good. The chicken was fine, but nothing to write home about. I was slightly disappointed in the brisket- it was SUPER fatty. Like almost all fat. It tasted great, but greasy and just not enough meat. The pork was pretty dry, sadly.\n\nThe sides, however, were all awesome. I could have eaten a tub of corn nuggets, they were that good! The Mac and cheese was delicious, and I really enjoyed the baked beans as well. The cornbread was yummy- sweet, dense, moist.\n\nWe had enough food to take some home, so that's always a plus. Someone did check on us during our meal, which also was appreciated.\n\nNext time I crave some bbq, and I'm in the area, I may stop by!"

It's in the same neighborhood as a number of strip clubs so be prepared to explain if the kids have questions. There were a lot of choices but I went with the brisket dog. It's a giant all beef hot dog topped with brisket, onion straws, and nacho cheese. This thing didn't mess around. It was big, messy, and delicious! It was a little bit spicy but not overpowering. My wife had the baked potato and she loved it. My son had the sliders and they were bigger than expected and he loved them too. My wife recommends the corn nuggets. I had one and they were great! The decor was fitting for a barbecue joint with benches and picnic tables. The wait wasn't long and I enjoyed myself. I highly recommend it."

I'm originally from Oklahoma and haven't been able to find BBQ that is even is the same wheel house as Oklahoman BBQ. You guys have completely nailed the BBQ.

I understand about the beef shortage in TX so I understand why rolling smoke raised their prices. \nI always get the AYCE option, and one of their employees remembers me because I always order it.  What I don't understand is why rolling smoke is sending out a quarter of the portions that they used to with each order of food. Before, I would order a meatloaf and get a FULL order( 2 nice slices) of meatloaf. Not a little crumpled portion from the end. Before I would order a of beef ribs and get 2 in an order, not one. This last visit, not only did the order taker miss a few of the items initially ordered, but they NEVER(even in previous visits) ask if you want to order more. You have to compete with the people in line and it creates and awkward situation. All portions sent out were not even close to what I used to get and sadly, I was bringing in people for thier first visit. How are you going to justify an order of wings and only give 2 wings in an order? \nThe 4 meat platter came with 2 tiny strips of brisket and the wrong sides. \n\nYou guys gotta find a better system for the AYCE. Maybe a flag on the table so your staff knows who is spending  twice the amount of money than the average guest and could show them a little more attention. Also accuracy in order taking is important too. I didn't mind the mistakes and poor service before, because there was value in what you were serving. \nNow Higher price/way smaller portions/no server/difficulty in ordering at $35 a person plus 20% tip? \nOuch. That's disappointing. You can't raise prices and give your guests way less. That's a no no. \nPlease fix this."

Listen, I ate at 36 real southern BBQ joints last summer and this brisket would rank last. Website says he is from Arkansas, but I would like proof because the brisket doesn't qualify as southern. You can tell by the way he chops it, real BBQ brisket is more shredded. He also should know nobody serves brisket on a hoagie roll in the south, it comes on a bun. Rollin Smoke has two sauces, one claims to be hot, but both taste exactly the same, nothing stands out in that respect. Moving onto the side dish, which is in a tiny cup and not worth the $2. It was jalapeno coleslaw and wasn't too bad, but I honestly didn't see any jalapeno's in the cup. It also appears he has changed the prices - up of course - after being open a week. The online menu says a combo includes drink, chips and side for $2, now the chips are excluded. The price of 1/2 rack of ribs is $10 online and $12 on another menu that is off to the side inside the place, but on the official menu it is now $16. The big smoker on the outside and good smell makes this place appealing to the eyes and nose, but it doesn't pass the taste test. If you do go, show the website coupon on your phone to save 10 percent and that way when you get home and eat your nasty brisket at least you will have saved some money and won't feel as bad."

Home fries was tasty but on bit on the greasy side and the mac& cheese seemed a bit tasteless and stale. We ordered brisket pulled pork, and short rib. The short rib was the best of the three. The brisket is a bit on the dry side. My suggestion is double up on the short rib when you order and get the pulled pork or the chicken for $20. 3 choice of meat for $20 enough to feed 2 hungry people from NYC. Not a bad deal at all.

Found in a strip mall behind all the casinos and strip joints, you would never guess this place is serving up delicious BBQ! One of the best BBQ experience I've had.\nWalked in and I was immediately engulfed by the sweet smell of BBQ smoke. I bellied up to the counter and looked over the menu. They have all your typical BBQ meats - brisket, chicken, pork, ribs, and hot links - however the taste is definitely not typical! They have sandwiches, plates, and even an AYCE option! I ordered the 3 meat plate (brisket, pork, and hot links) with 2 sides (jalape\u00f1o cole slaw, hush puppies) and corn bread. Everything was delicious! There are bottles of BBQ sauce on the tables if you wish to add.The sauce was excellent\n\nYou have to try #RSBBQ next time you're in #Vegas!"

The place is not far from the strip but does look a bit sketchy from the outside. The inside of the restaurant is very clean and the sports tv's are a bonus.\n\nI tried the pulled pork sliders and the rib platter, everything was tasty. The BBQ sauce is delicious, our ribs were cooked perfectly. \n\nAnd the corn bread is too die for!!!!"

Imagine the expectations that build up in 6 months; I already knew what I was going to have.\n\nPulled Pork Sandwich combo: I was pressured to get hush puppies, which were good for hush puppies (they have a little zing/spice to them from the jalape\u00f1o they mix in which made them better than average). As far as the pulled pork, it was some of the best I've had (although fattier than what I've had recently) however the bun it was served on left much to be desired. It was a hoagie type roll with sesame seeds, so the pork was trying to soak through the seem. Thankfully the sandwich didn't last long enough for me to make a huge mess of it. \n\nMeat Duo: brisket and pulled pork. Jason said he's had better brisket, and prefers Memphis (cause he's a square!) but the pulled pork was good. \n\nCheck in dessert: Butterfinger Bread Pudding: it was tasty, good texture for a bread pudding- I would probably order a regular bread pudding if they were on special when we come back.\n\nWe both really liked the sauces they offer on the table (we tried the spicy and sweet sauces) and the service was friendly. They were definitely happy to have gained our business and made sure we really enjoyed our food. \n\nWe'll be back."

There is usually a line to wait in to order your food from a guy sitting at a podium like a judge in court.  The prices are very high.  I ordered a half rack of St. Louis ribs, a half rack of Baby back ribs, Half pound of burnt ends, and a soda.  This came with two sides so i chose mac n cheese and coleslaw.  I paid $50.  WTF...?  \n\nThe ribs were awesome but the burnt ends were almost all fat and not burnt.  The mac  n cheese was something like what u get at a bad diner.  Coleslaw...meh.  Soda was great.  lol\n\nI assume a probably wont be back as its a pain to get there and costly.  I can eat at other rib places and get more bang for my buck IMO."

Ribs were even better... and the Pulled Pork was KILLER! \n\nPortions were generous... flavors were fantastic!  The potato salad had some spice to it and so did the pickles. \n\nMy wife had two meats, pulled pork and brisket... she raved about both.  She is a huge brisket fan, and she said it reminded her of being in Texas.  She loved it! \n\nI think the guys there have a handle on the BBQ side of things... it's great! Where I think, they could use some help is in the dessert's area... they were just alright.  I wasn't there to have dessert... so not a big deal... but... it's the only weak link about the place which stood out to me.

And prepare to fight for parking during the lunch rush. I went to Rollin Smoke days after returning from Lockhart, TX. I went not expecting to be impressed, but the pulled pork wowed me. It's usually something I prefer to make at home because it's not often I like it out. But this is tender, succulent and well smoked. The brisket was less impressive, I found it dry. I'd try it again when the sweet taste of central Texas wasn't so fresh. I might like it better. The combo I ordered also came with a dry burnt bun and I selected the mac & cheese for a side. It was pretty good, but I do prefer a creamier version.\n\nMy brother joined me for lunch, he had the baked potato topped with cheese and brisket. His order came out with pulled pork instead. No worries since it was a winner.\n\nThis was my first run in with Arkansas BBQ, they definitely make a great pulled pork. The jury is still out on the rest of menu. Must eat more to decide. The staff is super friendly and they're open late on the weekend."

The first place we planned to go to was not getting too many rave reviews.\nStephanie S. had the wonderful idea to come here instead for dinner. This place was pretty close to where we were staying on the strip, which made it easy drive for us. Located on the other side of the strip (yes on the seedy side of town) pass a couple of popular strip joints, made a turn thinking did my GPS give me the wrong directions because it's really dark on this street and it looks like it's the industrial area of Vegas. Well you are in the industrial area but it is also a mix of other business as well. Rollin Smoke is in a small shopping center look for a sign that says \"Kiesub Center\" and you have found it! Did I mention that they are open until 1:30 am every day too?\n\nAs we were pulling into the parking lot, I notice two huge bbq smokers outside. Knowing that anything that is put into a smoker is going to be mighty tasty I was ready to order right there in the parking lot!\n\nWalking into this eatery the BBQ smell hits you like a mack truck on the 15. Their menu is large and in charge! \n\nEverything from an all you can eat BBQ for $24.99 (you get anything on their menu, anytime, any day of the week)\n\n$7.99 sandwich's (like the pulled piggy, smoked brisket ECT)\n$8.99 meals (BBQ nacho fries, various wraps, outlaw burger and many options that are more wonderful to choose from)\n\nThen there are the various plates that they have. Minh and I decided on ordering and splitting The Pit Special: \n\nFour meats (of your choice) and three sides (of your choice) - Brisket, Chicken, two orders of spare ribs. Bacon Potato Salad, Yams, and Corn Nuggets all for $19.99!\n\nThey took Minh's name down and we seated our self's in an over sized booth. The owner was there making sure everything was running smoothly. This is a family owned business, which makes it have that charming-family-cozy kind of feeling.\nAs we were waiting for our food and other friends to arrive, I was chatting with Stephanie and watching the small eatery fill up with hungry families, club-goers and other various walks of life wanting some stick to your ribs goodness. \n\nA friendly server brought our food to our table. All I can say is the Pit Special offers a lot of food for your money! There is more than enough to share with another person. \n\nThe corn nuggets were the best ever! Fried on the outside (no grease on any of the balls) and yet soft and fluffy in middle. I was popping these in two at a time (sorry babe if you only got a couple). There are addicting! \n\nThe bacon potato salad was another favorite, chucks of potatoes various seasonings, mayo and probably mustard piled with bits of delicious bacon.  Swoon!\n\nAll the meats were tender (they \"rub\" their own meats daily) you can taste the quality of the meats they have. Not one piece was dry; we did try their homemade BBQ sauce, which was delightful on the brisket. The chicken and ribs had so much meat on it I got overwhelmed for a second. \n\nThis place is a gem in hiding, BBQ in sin city at its best! To the Holland family thank you for making this delicious food for every kind of budget!"

It wasn't until my food came out and I had a bite without the sauce that I understood exactly why I should do the same as the business suit guy. Their barbecue sauce is really good. I wish I could bathe in that sauce. Not really that would be gross but you understand the sentiment. 5 stars for that sauce.\n\nThey have $7.99 or $8.99 deals and even offer all you can eat barbecue. I ordered the $7.99 trio sliders and got chicken, brisket, and pork. It was so tasty. Presentation is aesthetically pleasing meaning the food is good looking. I do mind that the meat was colder than usual at room temperature or even a little colder. Food should come out piping hot so that once the customer decides to dig in, the food will still be extremely warm and fresh. 3 stars for the food.\n\nThe people working there are super cool. We were asked how our food was tasting too many times by 3 different workers. 5 stars for the service.\n\nSetup of the restaurant is weird. The ordering counter is inside one of the dining rooms so the line wraps around the dining tables so if you sit on those dining tables it'd be awkward. There's a connecting room with dining tables and me and my 2 friends avoided sitting on those dining tables by the line so that we sat at a table meant for 2. 2 on the bench and 1 on the chair, 2 shared one end of the table. There are outdoor dining in the front but no one wants to sit in the 100 degree Las Vegas summer weather. It wasn't until we were about to leave that I saw a separate dining table accessible from the outdoor dining on the left side of the restaurant. There could be signs inside the main dining area pointing out that there's that other separate dining room.. Or maybe I'm just oblivious? 2 stars for the restaurant setup."

Therefore, I must admit that when it comes to recognizing a good BBQ joint, it's hard to pull a wool over my eyes.\n\nSo this place, great service. The guy who took our order was nice; our food didn't take ridiculously long to come out. My wife and I split a trio with chicken, hot links and spare ribs. For $17 & some change, I was disappointed with the portion sizes. 1 hot link (not sure why they said linkS), 2 medium size spare ribs, 1 chicken drumstick & 1 thigh. Sorry, I may be spoiled by Chicago's fine eating rep but $17 at a BBQ joint in Chi-town typically gets you A LOT MORE. I also decided to try a blackberry cobbler (the menu says blueberry but they have blackberry)\n\nFood wise, it was ok. The rub on the ribs were \"OK\" (I've definitely had better). They weren't super tough but they weren't slide off the bone tender, they were somewhere in the middle. The hot link was actually good but it wasn't a smoked hot link that's standard for a BBQ joint but a pork hot link. The chicken was ok. My wife didn't like the seasoning on it so she peeled back the skin & put BBQ sauce on it. The blackberry cobbler was descent but considering the stark tartness of blackberry, it could've been sweeter to offset the tartness. Likely won't be back here next time in Vegas."

But once you walk in, you are greeting with a delicous smell of BBQ and walls of true Razorback fans! The inside is completely different the outside. This place is true BBQ. Everything was fantastic and the owner is really, really nice. We all got something different and there wasn't one back thing. I got the beef ribs which were literally fall off the bone. We also got the smoked meatloaf and pulled piggy sandwich. The piggy sandwich was very tender and moist but the star of the meals really was the meatloaf. I don't like meatloaf but I liked this one. It isn't your traditional meatloaf, it is smoked and BBQ. So very good. The portions are huge as well! You really don't need too many sides if any but if you do get some, the greens are good, yams and mac n cheese are good! I bet the rest are as well. I highly recommend going here! Yum!"

This BBQ is BEYOND AMAZING!!!!! You literally can taste the smoke off this meat.....& boy do I like that. So we tried the beef brisket sandwich with the spiced mac & cheese as the side. My sister and bro-in-law got the wings and the trio. Everything was so darn yummy!!! SAVORY! \n\nThe service rocks and I can't help but talk with a Southern drawl with these Alabaman owners.

Yup, I can deal with this. No ghetto-ness here! There is a large board with the menu and there is also menus provided by the staff.\n\nYou walk up and place your order. We ordered a smoking plate of the pork bbq ribs, bread and the mac n cheese combo and the fiancee ordered a smoked brisket sandwich. We also ordered the blueberry cobbler a la mode.\n\nThe ribs were really good. I like my ribs with a lot of sauce so luckily there was a bottle of sauce on each table. There are 2 dining areas with TVs, as well as outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is pretty much used for smokers. \n\nThe staff is really courteous, friendly and informative. If you're new to the restaurant, they are very helpful in making your decision. We did notice a lot of first timers.\n\nThe only issue we had, was that our food came out lukewarm. Not sure if the food was sitting out for a few minutes before serving to us, but it would have been tastier if the food was hot upon arrival.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place for those looking for a quick good meal off the strip. We had no wait, but after we placed our order, there was a line out the door. A lot of people ended up taking their food to-go, so that's a good thing if you plan to eat inside the restaurant."

We also added cornbread which tastes like cake, Yum. The people in Vegas are spoiled to have such an incredible Bar-B-Q place. If you're visiting Las Vegas and don't stop by to eat you missed the best food place in Vegas. We cheated and tried another Bar-B-Q place yesterday called John Mull's Road Kill Grill after seeing it on TV, but after eating their food we realized we wasted our gas, time & money as Rollin Smoke is closer and has way better Bar-B-Q. John Mull's Road Kill Grill not only was not close in quality it wasn't even in the same ballpark. Keep up making such great food and we will never stray again, as Rollin Smoke is \"DAM  GOOD\"!!!!"

We ordered rib tips, links, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, potato salad, coleslaw, peach cobbler and caramel cake all to go.  It took over 45 min for our order to be ready.  I would think the sides and desserts are already prepared and just need to scooped in a container.  So the wait was for links and rib tips?  The smokers were not on when we were there so we weren't waiting for meat.  \n\nCustomer service could have been friendlier.  They customer in front of me asked what sides they had and the guy taking orders just hit the menu where the sides were listed.  I wanted a link and sides but was told I had to get the hotlink sandwich.  I asked \"So I can't just get a link?\"  He said no not really.  When I pressed the issue he said I can get a 2 item combo and just get all hotlink.  I ordered that but why not just sell a link for $3 or $4 bucks?  After 40 min of waiting and seeing people order after me get their food I asked how long it would be and was told very gruffly that they are \"very busy\".  They were busy but I ordered before the lunch rush started.  I was also sitting in the booth next to the register so I could hear the orders and knew who was picking up phone orders, etc.  Also during the 45 min I waited at least 5 people told him the coke was out.  It was still out when I left.  \n\nOk.  On to the most important part the food.  Cause really, I will wait for hours and put up with bad service for some awesome BBQ.  \n\nSweet Tea- Not good.  I actually switched to soda and I rarely drink soda.  \n\nRib tips- Hubby thought they were ok.  I'm not a big beef rib person but thought they were ok also.  `\n\nLinks- No way that was 2 portions of links from my 2 meat combo.  It wasn't even 1 small link total.  But that is ok since they were so dried out it looked like they were days old.  I have never seen meat that dry in my entire life.  I'm being generous to say they looked like they were sliced the day before and left in the warmer overnight.  \n\nMac n cheese- very bland, noodles overcooked, could have used salt or real cheese.  \n\nMashed Potatoes-  Instant.  Yes they use instant potatoes.  All the other stuff there is good.  If they would use real potatoes it would probably be amazing.  \n\nPotato Salad- This was the best out of all the sides.  It was ok but wouldn't order it again.  \n\nColeslaw- Ok.  \n\nPeach cobbler- Cold.  Who serves cold peach cobbler?  Again ok.  Not great.  \n\nCaramel Cake- Yellow cake topped with caramel syrup, like the kind you buy for sundaes.  This was actually not bad.  I might even try it at home.  \n\nAll the sides seemed just a little spice away from being good.  Maybe I went on an off day.  I don't know.  After reading everyone's reviews I was so excited to come here and had high hopes for what I thought was going be my new favorite BBQ place.  I was heartbroken at how bad it was.  At some point I will try again cause these 5 stars reviews have to mean something.  But I'm gonna need my yelpers to go with me cause hubby isn't having it."

I didn't expect to find a place that would be on par with good 'ol Texas, but Rollin Smoke definitely takes the award for best barbeque in Las Vegas. \n\nOne of the best things about this place is the staff. Everyone that works there is super friendly, and loves having a conversation with you while they're taking your order. It creates an ambience that really makes you feel at home, which a lot of Vegas restaurants are lacking in. \n\nYou have many different options to choose from including AYCE but honestly, you'd have to come extremely hungry to manage that one. My go to is the three meat combo, which gives you any three meats of your choice, bread, and a side. It's good for those who like a little variety, but also want a little extra to take home. I usually stick with burnt ends a.k.a the only way to eat brisket, ribs, and whatever else I'm feeling that day. They put a little bit of sauce on it for you, but there's also bottles of barbeque sauce at the table so you can go as crazy as you'd like. \n\nIf you're in town and looking for some great barbeque, definitely give Rollin Smoke a try.

I've been here a few times with large groups of people and I love the pit room in the back, it even has a really cool grill fish tank. \n\nRollin Smoke really excels at their BBQ and sauces. We always get the pit special, 4 meats and 3 sides, and it feeds my little family of three. Their ribs and brisket are especially good. They do lack consistency though, the first time I had the brisket I could cut it with a fork and another time it was a bit tough. Either way, you want to slather it in the sauce on the table, it's the perfect tangy sweet spicy BBQ sauce. \n\nRollin Smoke is a bit of a let down when it comes to sides. I've tried many of them and the only ones worth mentioning in my opinion are the waffle fries, the green beans, and the hush puppies. You do definitely want a side of corn bread though, it's so good and sitting in a little butter bath. YES! You also want dessert, the banana pudding is pretty darn good and the peach cobbler is good but a little on the sweet side. \n\nDefinitely the best BBQ in Vegas, not the best I've ever had, but the best we've got!"

We chose the brisket, pork, and pork ribs. It came smothered in their BBQ sauce, which is slightly tangy and spicy. The pork ribs is the best out of the three...moist and tender; the meat literally falls off the bone. The brisket was a bit dry and the pulled pork was ok, just cover them in BBQ sauce and it'll be fine. \n\nAs for the sides, the mac and cheese was super cheesy, and the coleslaw has a spicy kick to it. The coleslaw helps give a taste variety to the richness of the meats. Definitely worth coming back the next time I'm in Vegas."

Don't worry though, the line moves fairly quickly.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n1/2 slab baby back rib plate (4/5) - Very meaty ribs, not fall off the bone but still juicy. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 because they didn't remove the casing from the outside of the rib and it made it a little hard to eat. Overall, I liked it and would order again.\n\nOutlaw burger (5/5) - My boyfriend who is a total burger aficionado tells me that this is the best burger he's ever had! Keep in mind that he loves bbq and bbq sauce so this burger did not cramp his style. There are tender pieces of brisket paired with ground beef, fried onion strings, barbeque sauce. Don't be shy because this WILL get messy!\n\nService is good here and people are really friendly. Unlike other casual dining places, the staff actually comes to check up on you after they've delivered your food. \n\nOh yeah and we checked in on yelp and they gave us a free ice cream sundae due to our burger order.

I did the two meat meal for $10.99. I got two short ribs and two strips of brisket on top of a soggy piece of white bread and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought the short ribs were very good and would recommend those. The brisket was good and the macaroni and cheese was forgettable. My wife got the $7.99 brisket sandwich and thought it was pretty good.\n\nBecause we checked in via Yelp, we got a \"free dessert.\" We ordered the Blue Bell Ice Cream Sundae. What they brought us was a shot glass sized plastic cup filled 2/3 with ice cream and 1/3 with whipped cream. If that dessert really costs 3.99, it is a complete rip off. It's more likely that they only gave us a sample size dessert as the \"free dessert\" that was advertised. Don't they know better than to cut corners with people who use Yelp? Whatever the case, I was less than impressed by that. \n\nOverall, I might stop back by here to give it another shot if I was in town for a bit and looking for a meal under $15 a plate (although they have many options that would put you over that limit, including an all you can eat thing for $25). But with so many other places to eat in Vegas, it's more likely I'll try somewhere else."

The burger is little excessive on the onion strings but I'll take it anyway.  It's definitely bursting with flavor.\n\nSo this place has been on my radar ever since I saw the pictures of the Outlaw Burger.  Since I love burgers, I had to make it here when I was in the area.  Luckily, I finally had that chance.  So with no hesitation, I walked in, stepped up to the counter and proudly, enthusiastically and anxiously as hell, ordered the Outlaw Burger...with a side of loaded mashed potatoes and cornbread.\n\nAfter only a few minutes (maybe 10 at the most but probably considerably less) the server delivered my order.  The Outlaw Burger is a monster!  The thing is probably about a foot tall, mostly onion strings but the actual meat and cheese portion of the burger is delicious.  The only downside is that halfway through the thing was falling apart and I pretty much had to eat it like a salad.  I'm not going to complain though because the thing was delicious.\n\nThe loaded mashed potatoes were a worthy addition to the meal and really hit the spot.  The sweet cornbread wasn't too bad but I probably would have ordered the corn nuggets or whatever they were called next time given the amount and since I've had sweeter, tastier cornbread before from my local grocer (in Rollin' Smoke's defense, I've yet to find better cornbread outside this particular grocer).\n\nService was good, the food arrived quickly and it hit the spot for sure.  For an off the beaten path little BBQ joint, this place has it going on.  I'm already thinking about eating here again, the only thing keeping me is a few hundred miles...at least for now.  \n\nI'll be back."

I've been spending all of my life dreaming of this Southern paradise. Well, at least the part of my life during which I have lived in Las Vegas because prior to that I was in the Southern paradise of Hotlanta. \n\nDriving here you will have your doubts that you are actually going to end up at an establishment that serves edible items. You may even believe you are being drawn into a cleverly disguised strip club or an automotive shop, but if you have your windows down about half a mile away you will start to smell the que, and you'll know you're headed in the right direction.\n\nI must say that I think their sides are even more delicious than their meat. I sampled their killer fried okra and baked beans, and I would go go back for those alone. But of course, their meat is delicious as well. I went with the two meat sampler and chose pulled pork and brisket. It is a generous heaping of meat. It was hard to tell where the brisket ended and the pork began, but they were both flavorful thanks to a sauce that is more spicy than sweet. The pork was a tad dry, but I didn't let any of it go to waste. \n\nThe environment is definitely casual, and in one room, they are using table cloths because there is apparently a couple of not so attractive tables hiding. However, the table cloths do lead to a lot of stains, so I hope they can wrangle some more attractive tables soon. \n\nAs for service, it is spectacular. The nicest bunch of Arkansas boys you could hope to meet. This should definitely be at the top of your short list of must-try BBQ in Vegas."

Some of the best bbq I've had in a while that wasn't from a chain (Famous Dave's - which I 'm not knocking as I've had great food there as well). I would go out of my way for TC Rib Crib so I'm glad I found a place closer to home. \n\nThis place is a little hard to get to but so glad we found it. I got the three meat platter with spare two spare ribs, pulled pork, and the FATTY part of the brisket with sides of cheesy mac and yams. The ribs were meaty and tender. Nice char on the meat, great smoky flavor! The pulled pork was tender as well. Great pork flavor. The fatty part of the brisket was killer! Nice burnt fat pieces with succulent strips of beefy goodness. They also threw in regular pieces of brisket which I didn't care for but took it home anyway. I don't care who makes it, I've never cared for brisket as I've always thought  it's a dry piece of meat. It was great cold the next day. The mac n cheese was creamy  enough, but even the extra cheese on top didn't make it \"cheesy\" enough. The yams were excellent. Lots of brown sugar cinammony goodness! The portions are large and come with a piece of Texas toast under the meats so it soaked up all the pork juices and was an extra added treat! My friend enjoyed his chicken and spare rib plate with jalapeno cole slaw and fried okra. There BBQ sauce is very good! Not too sweet, peppery and flavorul!    \n\nI take away a star because of the brisket and mac n cheese. I would have to try other things before upgrading to a 5. Great, friendly service and good food! I will be back!"

It also had the highest ratings of any Vegas barbecue joint I researched, which was just icing on the cake. \n\nIn true Las Vegas fashion, Rollin' Smoke offers an all-you-can-eat meal option which encompasses their entire menu! Tempted as I was, my stomach didn't feel quite up to the challenge (partially due to the prior night's \"festivities\"). I set my sights a little lower and ordered their Pit Special: brisket, pulled pork, burnt ends (instead of the advertised quarter-chicken), spare ribs, and hot links with bacon potato salad, cheesy mac n cheese, and kick'n bbq beans on the side.\n\nThe potato salad was, in a word, magnificent. Bacon and green onions give this side a great crunchy texture that brilliantly compliments the creamy mayo base. The beans were nice and sweet, with a great spicy kick on the black end. They certainly weren't lacking for black pepper, that's for sure. Large-size pasta noodles allowed the gooey cheese to get embedded in each nook and cranny of the macaroni. The extra layer of cheddar on top was just what it needed, too, adding another degree of cheesiness.\n\nRollin' Smoke's brisket comes chopped unless otherwise requested. Chopped or not, there was a ton of bark to go around. I also found a great smoke level in each bite of the incredibly tender brisket. There was just a hint of sauce drizzled on top, which allowed me to taste both it and the delicious meat at the same time.\n\nThe rosy smoke-kissed pulled pork looked exceptionally inviting. Upon closer inspection, it came with a smokiness that mirrored its appearance. The meat was also really juicy, with very flavorful chunks of bark throughout. As a Texan it pains me to say this, but I think that I enjoyed their pork more than the brisket.\n\nThe hotlinks were damn good. They had a great snap to the casing, with a char that added to the crispness as well. The heat of these links catches you a little off guard. It also masks any potential smokiness, but that's to be expected.\n\nBurnt ends aren't something that I get to enjoy all too often, so I was happy to find them on Rollin' Smoke's menu today. These were worth every bit of the $3.00 upcharge, and then some. Melt-in-your-mouth tender doesn't quite do them justice as a descriptor, but it's the best that I can muster. There was a great smoky flavor, coupled with a somewhat spicy glaze.\n\nThe ribs were cooked perfectly, with only a slight tug needed on each bite. Rollin' Smoke managed to produce tender and juicy ribs without cooking them into \"falling off the bone\" oblivion. The crust had a great blend of spices that combined both heat and sweet. Each bite of rib meat also contained a good smoke level that kept bringing me back for more.\n\nIn a town known for celebrity chefs and Michelin-star restaurants, Rollin' Smoke offers a blue-collar alternative so indulgent that you'll forget all about the glitz and glamour of the Strip."

The corn nuggets and bacon potato salad are to die for. The yams and kickin beans are also great. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Yelp said they closed at 8:00 but they were still accepting guests at 8:30 despite the open sign being turned off. They do not turn away their guests which I thought was interesting. I can't wait to go back!!"

Located under an overpass on the backside (i.e. More seedy section) of the strip in an industrial area, only the locals know where to find it. You can smell the hickory smoke before you even park the car.\n\nThe place is small, and consists of some wooden picnic tables for dining, and a front counter with register. There is only one menu, on the wall behind the counter, so make sure to know what you want before you get to the front. \n\nI personally suggest the brisket three ways and the chicken sliders (served on sweet Hawaiian rolls to boot). You will not be disappointed in the quality of meat, customer service, or level of smoke infused into your meal. The Arkansauce is pretty darn good too, although the meat doesn't necessarily need it. This place is awesome!\n\nThe only down side is you come out smelling like you work in a smoked meat factory, which makes for interesting conversation (including stares and people asking to smell your clothing) when you get back to the office after lunch!"

I had lots of questions about portion sizes and sides. I was advised to try the potato salad, Because their mama made it. (Heard in the background say yup) haha. \nMain course : I ordered the baby back and beef ribs, both were off the chart. Meat fell off the bone, and it was cooked with just the right amount of seasonings. Potato salad was indeed really good. \n\nI did not eat inside but the atmosphere was lively and super chill and diverse. Everybody's head was down looking at their plate. \n\nOverall, I knew I was in the mood for bbq but with the great customer service on the phone, friendly environment inside, & kick ass food, I'm definitely coming back for more. \n\nPs the house sauce and vinaigrette was my favorite."

Real BBQ, not the garbage you get from chain restaurants.\n\nWhen my wife asked co workers who have been long time Vegas residents where to get the good BBQ, this was the place frequently mentioned.\n\nRecently we tried this place out, and my brother and nephew went as well.  Everyone was very full and very satisfied when we left.\n\nTo find this place is by word of mouth, or you'll have to google it, because it sits a bit behind the Vegas strip in a more industrial area and chances are you would not happen upon it by mistake.\n\nAs soon as you drive up, you get that smell. That smoked BBQ smell that makes your mouth instantly water.  \n\nThe prices are a little up, but worth it for the food that you get. I personally ordered the three meat plate, which I chose to be the ribs, the pulled pork and the sausage.  My wife got the burnt ends for her meat.  All of it was crazy good.  Large portions, juicy meat and just totally full of flavor.  Be warned that while their food is not crazy spicy hot, there is a little kick to it.  The only thing I didn't find worth it was the side orders, I paid like four bucks for a side of coleslaw that was not life changing. \n\nMy nephew for the Outlaw Burger, which I'll load a picture off. This thing is every bit as big as it looks in the picture, and the hardest time he had was trying to figure out how to eat it.  He said he loved every bite of it, and has talked about coming back to Vegas from Cali to have another one.  \n\nOverall this is some of the best BBQ I've ever had and I liked the squeeze bottles of lots of different flavors of sauces they have all over. If you're in town, you gotta check this place out."

For $18 this meal is a great value if you want to try them all. Small price to pay for a GLORIOUS meal with big size and taste where the meat falls off the bones (beef). \n\nThe sides I ordered were Mac N Cheese with an extra helping of Corn nuggets for another $2.50. The sides are glorious too. By far the best corn nuggets I had to date. I also received the banana pudding just by checking in thru Yelp, a $4 dessert for free. Just GLORIOUS.\n\nThanks Yelp and Yelpers for making this place possible to find.\n\nLastly, this place was featured on an episode of Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Enjoy!"

Let's say it's not a place I would wait an hour in line for, and we know we've all done that for some really good BBQ.  Anyway, decided on the rib special for $24.99 which came with 2 St. Louis ribs, 3 babybacks and I beef rib plus one side which we got waffle fries. We also added another beef rib for $6.  And for all those who really like BBQ, they also have AYCE anyday, anytime for $34.99.  \n\nThe highlight of the dish was the beef rib.  The meat was fall off the bone super tender.  It tasted like what I expected from a beef rib, but it was lacking a rub or a bbq sauce that would have blown me away.  It was still good though just not great. The St. Louis ribs and babybacks were mediocre and but still tasty.  But based on just what we ordered I would have to say, I have definitely tried better BBQ but the place is worth giving a try.  The menu is huge, so even if your not craving BBQ, you can order other stuff like meatloaf or fried chicken."

It may seem pricey, it may seem like the quantity of beef ribs seem nominal, but these beasts are  HUGE, and you taste the love put into making them, I guarantee you!\n  Another complaint I have with most BBQ places is that they've just defaulted to doing a BBQ sauce so ridiculously sweet, you might as well just drown your ribs in maple syrup like it's a pancake.  But Rollin' Smoke specializes in my favorite--the vinegar-based savory sauce, which just launches this most tender of beef ribs into orbit on your tastebuds!"

            "review": "As with anyone who has been to Vegas a few times, you grow sick of the options on the strip, so one of my goals was to find a few places off the beaten path for us to try this next time around. \n\nBBQ is really the reason I started yelping and everywhere I go, I usually seek out a BBQ place to try, so when I saw all the positive reviews of Rollin' Smoke, naturally I was a bit excited. \n\nAfter our first long night in Vegas, we decided to skip breakfast and hit up Rollin' Smoke for an early lunch. Our cabby didn't know where it was, but it was a fairly quick ride from the strip.\n\nWalking in, you are greeted with a glorious, thick, smoky smell that always accompanies good BBQ. As with all my BBQ reviews, I usually seek out a way to try out most of the meats, so we ordered the three Pit Specials (3 meats, 2 sides) and one order of the Beef Ribs. We quickly realized we ordered too much food for the four of us, but it was no matter, it was all delicious. The meats:\n\nThe Pulled Pork - The pulled pork was flavorful and moist, with a moderate smoky flavor. If you like pulled pork, you won't be disappointed by this. \n\nThe Hot Link Sausage - Despite how good the other meats were, the Hot Link made a good run to be one of my favorites. This isn't like most hot links you see which are red in color, both on the sausage meat and on the casing, with that annoying spicy flavor that seems to linger forever. These had a reddish-brown casing and a very delicious and unique flavor too them, with a nice spiciness as well. Definitely recommend. \n\nThe Ribs - The baby backs were delicious. Moist, tender, fall off-the-bone good. They seasoning added some nice flavor as did the moderate-to-strong smokiness. Another awesome dish.\n\nThe Brisket - The brisket we were served was from the lean side and had a nice smoke ring to it and despite being from the lean side, was not dry at all. Very solid brisket and only due to the greatness of the other dishes was this our least favorite. \n\nThe Beef Rib - Holy crap, the other reviewers were not wrong. This thing is amazing. It should be called The Flinstone or Brontosaurus Rib. It is massive. It has an amazing bark, strong smokiness, and tons of meat. It wasn't too gristly either, like many beef ribs tend to be. You get two ribs for 15 bucks and you think that is steep until you receive them. That will be more than enough to fill you up. A must order here. \n\nThe Sauce - I think good BBQ can be graded as to whether it needs sauce, and the BBQ here stands on its own. However, the sauce was pretty good if you like sauce. The rust-colored sauce starts out sweet and ends tangy and is fairly runny too. It is great for dipping and doesn't overpower the  meat. \n\nSo the 4.5 star rating for Rollin' Smoke is spot on and consider this to be a 4.5 star review to match as well. This Arkansas-style BBQ just made it on my mandatory to-do list in Vegas for each trip. If you like BBQ, don't pass this place up."

When we have guests from out of town come to visit, we always bring them here for the brisket burger (which is always massive and freakin yummy), combo plate (they have to sample the other things too!), and the banana pudding! They've won me over. I have not one single complaint about this place. Hopefully they keep up all the good food and service. : )"

            "review": "This is a new out of the way bbq restaurant that recently opened on Highland Dr.  I know that Highland is an industrial and seedy area west of the strip, but these guys are turning out some good bbq and making the most of what they have.  I recently tried the Biggin sandwich (brisket, pulled pork and sausage) and it was very tasty.  The sandwich was loaded with meat, literally falling off the bun, all of the meats were tender and had a good smoke flavor.  Along with my sandwich was a side of bacon potatoe salad, which was good.  The potatoe salad had good flavor and bacon in just about every bite.  Total for my sandwich, salad and drink ran me $11, which I think is a good value for quality food.\nThis is a spicier bbq than most people are used to, but it works.  It reminds me more of a kicked up Kansas City style bbq.  I stuck with the original sauce, which was plenty hot and did not try the spicy or the extra spicy.\n\nAll in all this place is making some pretty good bbq, which is much needed in Las Vegas.  The biggest draw back is that they are located on Highland next to Diamond Cabaret and they are only open until 6pm.  I would like to see this place do well, hence my review, but their limited hours and location create much doubt.\nGood Luck!"

It was even better in person.  I got a two meat plate with two ribs and sausage.  The ribs were smokey and flavorful.  The sauce complimented them well.  The meat was nice and tender too.  The sausage was smokey and delicious as well.  My friend got a pulled pork sandwich and loved it.  We each got the mac and cheese side.  The mac and cheese is a good enough side to have as a main course.  I also got the corn poppers, which are a must try.  They're delicious and addictive.  The staff was really friendly to me and everyone else I saw in there.  We ate inside, but the outdoor tables looked like a good spot to hang out as well.  The place isn't super fancy, but who wants a super fancy BBQ spot anyway?  When I think of BBQ, I want real good food in a good environment.  This place delivers both.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town."

The brisket was not what I expected it was chopped very fine which is good I guess for sandwiches. ( I hope it is not that way in a meal). Pulled pork was excellent and the sauce was good with just right amount of spice. The Beans were a bit too peppery for my tastes but some may enjoy it. Mac-n-Cheese was marginal but not crazy good also heavy use of pepper. Great filling meal, great taste overall. Will go back to try more menu items."

The spare ribs and baby back ribs were good, but unfortunately after eating the beef rib first, it just didn't compare.  The BBQ sauce here is the perfect mix of sweet, tangy, and spicy.  And the list of sides makes it hard to decide...unfortunately they were out of fried okra so instead I had a side of corn nuggets, and these things are magical, imagine deep fried cream of corn.  The customer service is great as well, they come around and check on you a few times to make sure you are enjoying the experience.

Neither the bellhop at the hotel nor the taxi driver had  heard of this place and we had to pull out our smart phones to map the way there. Located in a semi-industrial area that's just 10 minutes away from the strip, it took a bit of convoluted driving to actually get there. It's not a fancy place, simple benches, plastic utensils, noisy, with an order counter and serve your own drinks, but oh man... the food... the food! (They also have sweetened tea - have to have that in a Southern BBQ place, right? Right??)\n\nThis place was suggested by a couple of local friends when I was visiting and we met up for dinner. We got what I think was the \"Pit special\" which was the variety platter, 5 meats and 3 sides - Pulled pork,1/4  chicken, hot links, ribs and brisket - an extra order of the corn nuggets - think of tater tots made with kernels of corn and corn meal, green beans and coleslaw. The slaw was good but we had to dole out the corn nuggets to be fair or any one of us would have hogged them all.\n\nBest Southern BBQ I've had in a long, long while - so good I did not try any of the other sauces - they make several - on the meat. They did not drown everything in sauce either, but encouraged you to try the various sauces. Crisp, well seasoned chicken skin, saucy (but not too saucy) pulled pork, ribs with just the right amount of char, tender brisket, spicy links... it was all good.\n\nThen it was time for dessert and the chef was walking around talking to customers and we asked about dessert, with a friend asking if \"Mama's Banana Puddin\" was made of real custard. Hoo boy, you'd think we just insulted his Momma. \"You think I would use box vanilla pudding? Man, you gotta stand there and stir that custard by hand or it ain't good! That's the only way you can make Banana puddin!\"\n\nWe settled on the banana pudding and the blackberry cobbler and shared - because we were so full from dinner (and we had left overs to take home) - we scraped those bowls clean! Talk about greed... I was tempted to get another! The Banana custard was smooth and tasty, the consistency of the custard just perfect - none of that grainy fake pudding mix in that!. The cobbler topping was not overly sweetened which let the blackberry taste shine through.\n\nAltogether, a wonderful gustatory experience - and the cost for this wonderful experience? Oh... about $12 each."

Now, some people might say there is better bbq in KC or Texas, etc.  Well, I am rating it based on the fact that it is objectively very good, and definitely the best I have had in Las Vegas.  I got the \"biggun'\" sandwich, which had pulled pork, brisket and hot link.  The hot link was delicious and did not have the overly greasy and oily nature of a standard hotlink, which are often like kielbasas.  The meat was very good as was the sauce.  I had a couple pieces of brisket that were a little overcooked, but overall it was excellent.  I also had some of their st Louis ribs, which were tasty.  Flavorful, tender and fall off the bone, although a little fatty...but that is what you generally get with st Louis ribs.  Fried okra and greens were very good as well, and they had a ton of other sides.  Unfortunately they were out of the cobbler and pudding, so I did not get to try those despite all the claims of excellence. Now, they location and d\u00e9cor are not exactly phenomenal, but I suppose it is what they could afford starting out.  It is close to the strip also which is good if you are in that area.  Overall, super friendly and very delicious, but definitely expensive for BBQ.  Best bbq I have had in vegas though."

The wait isn't bad at all. It's a order, sit and then they will call your name and bring it to you kinda place. \n\nI'd say try the Mac and cheese, greens and yams bc that's what I had for sides. Cornbread is also yummy, not too sweet. Pull prom and chicken are my favorite meats. \n\nI'll be coming back here next year when I'm in town next year."

Sadly, I was not blown away.\n\nAllison S., Dyanna L. and I met up at Rollin Smoke with our men for dinner on a recent Saturday evening. From the parking lot the place smelled amazing, so we quickly got in line to order. Rollin Smoke is a order-first-then-seat-yourself kind of establishment which I have no problem with. I do wish the tables were wiped down more regularly though, as the one we were at was rather dirty. \n\nOur food was ready very quickly. My husband and I both got the 2 meat plate; brisket and chicken for him, ribs and pork for me. Each came with a side (green salad for him, loaded mashed potatoes for me) as well as a 'roll' which is really just a slice of bread. \n\nFor me, good bbq means good ribs, and ribs will always be what I judge BBQ on.  This is where Rollin Smoke fell flat. The ribs were tough, not the fall-off-the-bone that I expected (and read about in other reviews). The flavor was ok, certainly not amazing. The pork was better, my husband's brisket was good, and Allison let me try some of her hot link which was excellent. \n\nPerhaps it was just an off evening for Rollin Smoke? I will certainly go back and try the ribs again, but for the time being I can not give Rollin Smoke more than an A-OK rating.\n\nNOTE: The price for All-You-Can-Eat has gone up to $34.99. Website is not updated as of 1/5/15."

The meat that is served is ALWAYS tender, and well seasoned. The portions are generally big, and the prices are great for what you're getting. \n\nWhen I'm there I always get the Trio Choice of 3 Meats. I pick the 1/4 chicken, brisket and 2 spare ribs which is more than enough for me. This is always shared with someone else for because it's so much meat that its filling. But then again, I'm a girl, and I've seen guys finish their whole entree effortlessly. Again, I love how everything is so tender at this place and just well seasoned. They come with their own bbq sauce which is just ah-mazing! How in the world did they come up with that secret sauce? I'll never know but it's that little condiment that really makes a difference in your overall Rollin Smoke experience. \n\nThis place is always packed with people whether you find yourself in a line to order or dining-in, but their service is swift so don't fret about the line. It's a small eatery but they do have an area where you can seat you and a large party. \n\nTry this place out! The ratings are high for a reason! :D"

It is by far the best barbecue in Vegas and some of the best I've had anywhere.\n\nWhen you pull up into the parking lot, you can see the smokers outside. When you walk in, the smell of barbecue is in the air. The place is inviting and the staff (and owners) are very nice and genuinely proud of their food.\n\nI got the trio platter for $13.99 which includes three meats, a side, and a fountain drink. I chose pork spare ribs (ribs+tips attached), beef brisket, and pulled pork, with mac&cheese as my side. You get two spare ribs as an item in the trio. Other choices were 1/4 chicken or links. It's quite a deal!\n\nThe pork spare ribs are amazing. Meaty, well-seasoned, great smoke ring, and the flavor was unbelievable. The brisket was quite good and the pulled pork was tender and flavorful. I wish I would have eaten the brisket and pulled pork before the spare ribs though, because the more delicate flavor of those meats was overtaken by the taste of the ribs.\n\nMidway through my meal, I heard someone order a beef rib. I LOVE beef ribs and it's very rare that a barbecue place serves them. So I had to get that too. $6.99 for a rib, but completely worth it. It is intensely beefy in flavor and gets more and more juicy as you eat it. Sort of tough on the outside, but near the bone it was beyond anything I could have hoped for.\n\nI was so impressed that I was texting my friends all through my meal. I ended up ordering almost $100 of barbecue to take back to my friends. It has been a week now, but my phone still smells like barbecue. One of my friends ordered some smoked hot links, so I got to try that as well and they are really good. I usually scoff at ordering links at a barbecue place, but these were special.\n\nAll told, I tried every meat on their menu except for the chicken and the smoked meat loaf. The pork spare ribs take home the ribbon, but everything else was not far behind. My friend's beef ribs did look much smaller than the one I got and he said it was dry all the way through, so ask for a big hefty one to make sure it's tender.\n\nFor side dishes, I would not recommend the mac&cheese. It wasn't that good. Other tables had jalapeno cole slaw, bacon potato salad, fried okra, and hush puppies. All those seemed to be well-liked.\n\nThe barbecue sauce is made in-house and is very good. It might be very slightly too sweet for my liking, but I order my barbecue with sauce on the side anyway, so I didn't mind much. They also make a spicy barbecue sauce which you can request.\n\nOh, they also have a buffet option. For $25, you get unlimited everything on their menu. If you like beef ribs, two beef ribs are $15. Eating four beef ribs and a side already puts you ahead."

I explained how good it all was and he gave us a high five. Nicest guy!\n\nSo not only is the food great, but the customer service was equally as good. You can tell they care about every aspect of their business, from the quality of the food to the people they serve.\n\nAs a fellow small business owner, and one in the food industry, it can get VERY hard to just run an establishment, let alone do it in a way that makes people obsessed with your food. Somehow, they make this place work pretty seamlessly and we will most CERTAINLY be back soon. My dad is going to lose his mind once we bring him here!"

Rolling smoke has been my favorite BBQ in town for over a year, love the brisket, giant beef ribs, and sides.  $24.99 all u can eat dine in special seems like good value. My issue is as it's gotten more popular the wait for ordering and food is tough, especially if I'm with my children. I don't see the owners in anymore and it's not as friendly. My last visit half my to go order was missing (after waiting over 30 min) and the employee made a joke that it was my fault because I initially didn't respond when my name was called (knew my order wasn't one bag).  I would have preferred apology for trying to send me on my way with half of a $40 order! Despite loving the food I'm hesitant to go unless during slow time"

Me and my friend shared a platter with five meats (brisket, pulled pork, sausage, chicken and ribs) that came with three sides. Sausage was a little spicy. We chose mac n cheese, corn nuggets and loaded mashed potatoes as our sides. I LOVED the mashed potatoes, they were the perfect guilty pleasure. My favorite of the five meats was the brisket. Oh and they have a bunch of sauces, from vinegar sauce to mustard sauce to hot sauce. There is indoor and outdoor seating. We chose to sit outside on one of the long picnic benches and it was perfect. Chef Willie brought us a delicious dessert...it was some sort of apple tart topped with vanilla ice cream. I will be back!"

Pulled pork didn't seem to have much sauce (I would prefer some sauce). The brisket was too dry maybe they smoked it too long and dried out the meat.

I guess I should have tried the beef ribs because the brisket I had was overcooked, dry and tough, the pulled pork wasn't tender enough, and you can't order baby back ribs with the combos, only St. Louis.  I had a couple of those and they were OK, just extra fatty.  Overall, I was disappointed because I'm a BBQ aficionado due to my multiple trips to Texas every year. \n\n I like BBQ so much I bought a Texas-style smoker with a side firebox and spent a few years perfecting my 'Q smoking skills.  I can do a brisket and pulled pork that are miles ahead of what we got here and my baby backs are killer.  I don't know, maybe it was too late in the day, we got there about 7 PM and despite what it says in the listing, they close at 8 on weekdays.  The pit master, who seems to be a very nice guy and is very friendly, brought a bunch of briskets in that had just come out of the smoker and maybe we got the tail end of the last batch.  Even if that was the case however; what we got shouldn't have been served in my opinion, it was that bad."

Disclaimer, I don't eat pork.  So, I cannot speak on the goodness of the ribs and pulled pork.  But, what I can tell you is that the brisket (3 ways) was delicious.  My favorite of the three was the burnt ends.  The right amount of flavor and char.  FYI, they have an all you can eat option for a very resoanable price.  That affords the curious grubber a variety of options.  With that, I also tried the smoked chicken, shrimp, mac & cheese, fried okra, and corn nuggets.  My favorite of the sides: corn nuggets.  All the rest were meh.  Admittedly, I'm  a mac & cheese snob...so, it barely stood a chance.  Lastly the desserts...both the banana pudding and peach cobbler left me underwhelned.  At this point you may be wondering why 4 STARS?  The BBQ was excellent.  The service was outstanding.

This place was smokin'! \n\nThe place had a large amount of people, but the wait wasn't long at all. This isn't a sit down and get served type restaurant. It's more of an order at the counter and pick where you want to sit joint; a style that is very appropriate for a BBQ place in my opinion. \n\nWe had a party of three so we got to see a decent amount of the menu. My boyfriend got the talked about Outlaw Burger and it was HUGE! Only 12 bucks for the combo, which includes a drink and a side. It comes with a ton of onion strings and an optional sauce if you want to kick up the heat. \n\nAs for myself, I got the Brisket Sandwich Combo($11).\nFor my side, I got the corn nuggets which were absolutely delicious! I tried a sample in line and it was love at first taste. As for the sandwich, it definitely was good but could have used more sauce. \n\nOur other party member got the sausage link combo($11) with mac and cheese. He wasnt digging the sausage sandwich but I think he wasn't in a sausage mood, unfortunately. The mac and cheese on the other hand...oh baby! So creamy and delicious. They use shells instead of elbow macoroni which definitely is a strong point for the dish. \n\nAs for the staff, very friendly and made us feel at home.\n\nOverall, everything was amazing! My faves include:\n- Corn nuggets\n- The Outlaw Burger\n- Mac and Cheese \n\nDefinitely going to come back to try other items.

Today was a down day and the 1st time was a better day.  I was at a 3.5 after the 1st time and gave it a 4, today it earned it's three.  \n\nHad the rib combo 3 baby back,  2 spare, 1 beef. The beef rib came out sauced,  I didn't expect that as it didn't last time.  I sent it back and asked for one without sauce. When I got the plate back it was the same rib with sauce rubbed off. This was highly irritating. Wonder what else was done to my food while it was sent back.  I don't dare to let my mind wonder that road.  I should have been served a new rib that had never been sauced.  Not one that was wiped off. Sigh, urg, I seem to be more upset about this the more I think about it. The beef rib was good this time not as good as the 1st time.  The baby backs were better than the spare but both were underdone as neither pulled away from the bone easy and were kinda tough, even though they had good flavor. Definitely not as good as the 1st time. \n\nThe 1st time I also had the brisket which was above average but not great.  Also had pulled pork that was pretty good.  \n\nAll the meats here do have varying degrees of a Smokey taste,  as well varying degrees of smoke rings.  So they are cooking these meats with the right methods. \n \nFor sides I have enjoyed the corn nuggets and fritters both times, but I am not sure if these are not just prepackaged items instead of homemade. \n\nLast but not least the desserts. I had the berry cobbler today.  I would definitely stay away from this item as it wasn't very good.  Ordering the peach cobbler and banana pudding seem like your safest and tastiest bets for dessert. \n\nIn summary if this was my 1st time it would be my last time. Still can't believe I didn't get a fresh rib instead they just wiped it off. If this would have been my 1st time they would have been 2 stars based just on that fact alone. Not sure if I will stop back in here or not.  On a good day they are the best in the area. (Really no good bbq in Vegas, so thats not saying much (though I have one that just popped on my radar that I need to try), ). On a bad day well it is just okay. \n\nYour milage may vary."

If you are a burger fanatic, you should at least try it. But, what I think about when I think of this place is the beef ribs. One rib is a whole meal, they are so big. The beef rib is tender, tasty and totally trimmed of excess fat and gristle. This is the must-try from this place. Beef ribs. Amazing and I want to know how they do that (I'm a cook)! The only issue is finding the place, so head south on Highland from Sahara for about a mile, then you will see it tucked into a little strip-mall.

We ordered the combo BBQ to sample their BBQ and also a pulled pork sandwich. It was a large burger. Underneath all that meat was a sausage. Everything was cooked just right. The meat was juicy and came right off the bone.\n\nThe place was packed for 2pm on a Saturday, clearly pass its lunch hour but there was a steady stream of customers. If you want hole in the wall, this is the place. Everything about the place tells you these people didn't come from LA or NYC. They came from what, Arkansas? There's a boar's head on the wall to greet you and keep you company when you wait in line.\n\nThe menu items are simple. We got mac and cheese, yams, and fried okra. You get a side if you order a soft drink. How can you eat BBQ without a Coke? You just can't, so the side was an added compliment.\n\nThere is only 1 restroom though so I suggest you do your business become you come or else it might be a wait. Out of the 3 different styles of BBQ, I'd say they hit it on the head for each one. There is bbq sauce on the table if you like but I found that the ribs were nicely done and I didn't need anymore sauce.\n\nSauce wise, I think Lucille's might just be a tad better but not by much. I like them to cook their meat as good as this place. Is it always pefect? Nope. The first time that I came here, the baby backs were a little dry but this time everything was cooked right.\n\nI could not finish my meal and took the rest home. If you have trouble locating this place it's across Shetakis distribution and below the Sahara bridge I believe."

I'm from the South (Georgia and Florida) and think this place is really close to my ideal restaurant. I got the pulled pork sandwich and a side of greens. Wasn't to keen on the hoagie roll (mainly because I'm used to pulled pork on hamburger buns), but that's inconsequential due to the fact that the pork was awesome. This is my main method of judging BBQ joints and they passed with flying colors. Added to that, the greens were perfect. If you've been missing collards, mustard, or turnip greens, this is a great combination of all three. Definitely check in first so you can get the dessert. I didn't but the server didn't mind adding the order, which was nice because of the consideration. I got the banana pudding which was good, but I would have liked to have had some bananas in it. Just preference, really, because the overall flavor was inline with what I wanted. Additionally, the service was very courteous and friendly. Overall, it would be really unfortunate to miss this place especially because there are so few good BBQ restaurants in this town. Check it out. This place is worth it."

I had the trio plate with chicken, brisket and hot links, my wife had brisket and ribs - everything was great with good smoke and rub flavour.  My wife didn't have sauce on hers and in her opinion it wasn't required. I found the sauce delicious but be forewarned, it has some heat to it. The onion rings and corn nuggets were awesome sides, I wish we could have tried some more of them. We most definitely will return on our next visit and will be recommending Rollin Smoke to our friends travelling to the area."

They actually smoke the meat and there is evidence of that, since when I walked in, my eyes started watering immidietely (I have sensitive eyes) from the smoke inside the restaurant. However, that did not hinder my expirience since the food is damn good. I will be taking my food to go until some sort of vents are installed. There are two rooms and some seating outside. It looks like a hole in a wall but those tend to have really good food. I only expirienced the first room (when you just walk in) so may be the second room does not get effected by the smoke or has vents, I would not know. \nItems tried: Spare ribs, wings, chicken, the outlaw burger, waffle fries, mac n cheese, hush puppies. Favorites: Spare ribs, waffle fries (so good!). The others mentioned were pretty good too. Don't belive me? On the fence? Go try it and write about it!"

Nonetheless, it was definitely worth the trip.\n\nI am giving my 300th review to Rollin' Smoke BBQ. Definitely a solid 4 star meal when it comes to BBQ beef brisket. I just tried the Brisket 3 Ways which consisted of sliced brisket, chopped brisket, and burnt ends. The meat was very good on its own, but I added some of their Arkansas BBQ sauce to it. I thought their bbq sauce was excellent. They also offered a sweet bbq sauce, but I preferred the tangy version. I also ordered a side of waffle cut fries, which were seasoned very well.\n\nI will definitely be back to try the beef ribs and some other menu items. I will probably add another star on my next visit if the beef ribs are as good as the brisket."

We chose the brisket (chopped per the hostess's recommendation), ribs (fall off the bone ofc), and pulled pork (so much juicy tenderness!). Got their bbq beans (so good ugh) and potato salad (HIGHLY recommend) as sides. Having trouble eating it all, portion is so big!\n\nThey also have all their bbq sauces available for you to squirt on your meat (huehuehue) and you should try all of them.

Ordered a Full slab of Baby backs to go $28.00 It said that every plate came with a dinner roll and a drink. They didn't put the roll on. I questioned the guys delivering  the food they said \"no\" it doesnt. I re read the board and ask the girl at the register she says \"yes\". When they deliver the rolls the explanation is that there is a menu change coming. OK I get that. Use a piece of tape and cover the roll if your not giving it out anymore.\nHere's my advice. You charge alot for the food don't be short sighted. The roll is pennies on each plate.\nI and many others ( long line behind and in front of me) do not mind paying prices if the food is good. Give something away on the plate (roll). One of the guys tried to sell me that the slice of bread that my food was on was the roll?\nLook down the road at longevity and you will see if you penny pick people no matter how good the food is we won't come back. \nI again will say some of the best BBQ I have had hands down but they have some kinks to work out."

Headed on over in a hurry! When I pulled up I thought the outside was interesting with the picnic tables and yeah just the whole location is weird but needless to say who cares the food is good! The menu is posted on a HUGE window outside so that you are able to get your ordered figured out prior to going inside however in this 1000 degrees of heat I opted to read my menu INSIDE ha! The 3 meat trio priced at about $17.99 was fair and the only thing I didn't like was they could've gave me a little bit more of the mac n cheese for my side :-/ In addition to that order we also got the BBQ Nacho Fries with the brisket!

The really got the smokey part down where the brisket leaves the deep red rim below the charred tip.\n\nFor sides we got:\ncorn nuggets -  which was yummy as I never had something like it\ncollard greens - i loved it as it wasn't too greasy or cooked with bacon. Instead they used pieces of the smoked brisket to cook it in. Delicious and less guilty to eat.\nfried okra - never thought this was good but it actually was. \nI wanted corn on a cob as one of the sides but they didn't have any which is the first I've heard at a bbq but since their other choices are good, i wont complain. \n\nCost: Very descent. For our 4 choice sampler, 3 small sides and a soda to share ALL for $19.99!! I'm happy with that! \n\nSeating: Majority are in a big benches. Which you may have to share if it gets crowded.

So IMHO and friendlier version RSB is just decent, OK is being nice. I've been here a few times and well I am NOT a fan. Each time I've been disappointed with one thing or another. Yes I've gone back but that's just cause everyone's been raving about RSB and I wanted to give them another shot and then another.\n\nOne of my first visits was with a group of 5-6 from work. I don't remember what everyone exactly ordered but remembered me having the chopped pork sandwich and another having the chopped chicken sandwich which neither I can find on the menu, must have been a special. Anyways from both of the sandwiches we created a community pile of what's this!? tiny pieces of chicken bones. There were a lot of chopped up chicken spine and rib bones all mixed in our meats. Even if I was mistakenly served chicken with my pork, bones, really RSB. I had more typed out but I leave it as that. The only good thing about it was I had a free dessert with Yelp check-in. STRIKE ONE.\n\nAfter writing off RSB for a couple months the group made it back out. This time ribs and Outlaw burgers were ordered. They certainly took their time bringing the ribs out.  Ribs were ordered first and was last to be served. What exactly were they doing!? Warming it up or cooking them as it was ordered. I actually asked for and ate my dessert first cause I was hungry. The ribs that came out was beyond disappointing tough, rubbery, had little taste, and sucked. I've had way better.  I noticed my ribs were different from the others. Oh there's a \"rib plate\" and a \"rib platter special\". STRIKE TWO.\n\nAfter working up an appetite playing basketball all morning I came here looking to finally clear things up and getting the rib platter special. It was a lot of ribs but it lost all its luster. The beef rib wasn't as tender as I was hoping but tender to some liking. The rest were decent nothing exciting just a lot of meat covered in sauce. I smelt all the smoke inside and outside of the RSB but I got only a hint of smoke taste. STRIKE THREE. Throat slash. \n\nThe best BBQ in Vegas!? I don't know about that. Maybe, than again Vegas aren't known for BBQ and the ones I've enjoyed no longer are open so maybe I don't know anything about BBQ plus I sometimes enjoy buffet BBQ ribs. You want more info there's AYCE BBQ for $24.99. It's located off a few side streets near the Strip. They have a small parking lot which is shared with the other businesses. They're from Arkansas. They're friendly but I wouldn't call the service great. There's large tables, small tables, and booths. Lines for ordering can form out the door. Just go if you like go."

I thought it was so unique this place offers \"all you can eat\" for anything and everything on the menu.  I was personally on a mission to devour some St. Louis style BBQ ribs, greens and some \"kickin beans\" and.........well I can say this: \"If these are not served in heaven, then I shall not go\"  absolutely remarkable and hands down the very best BBQ in Vegas.  Don't let the \"hole in the wall\" location fool you, it will be one of the best BBQ experiences of your life.  The owner is very pleasant and takes a great deal of pride in what they serve.  Service was great and food was even better.   THIS IS A MUST VISIT!"

Couldn't finish it all because that is a lot of meat and fat for 1 meal. The side I chose was the greens. Bad choice for me because they were too spicy for my pallet and I couldn't eat them. But they were probably perfect, it is just me. Corn bread was very good too."

I also had the potato salad with crumbled bacon,  mac n cheese and the bbq beans, my taste buds were in heaven!  If you've tried other bbq restaurants and thought they were missing something you really need to try Rollin Smoke.  The very BEST in Vegas!! Top notch customer service and very clean."

I just now realized they close at 8pm, which was the time we arrived at the spot. Not once did any of the workers mention this to us, they are so friendly and welcoming. I must've took forever to figure out what I wanted to order too - now I feel so bad for being a douchebag customer LOL. I even ordered it to go then we ended up eating there instead....and still, not one mention about their closing time. Thank you guys for allowing us to savor your wonderful product way past closing...kudos forrealz! On top of all this, hubby asked me to order another rib piece to go - and boy did we luck out. They happily took our order and sent us off with two pieces instead of one. WINNIN!\nBeef ribs = easy 10+\nCheesy mac n cheese = 10\nRib tips = 8\nPeach cobbler = 9\nCustomer Service = 10+\n\nLikelihood to return = you betcha!\n\nIf you're a first timer, don't let the location sway you...you will sorrily miss out!"
