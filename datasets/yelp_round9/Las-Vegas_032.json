            "review": "We had high hopes for this place. We saw an episode of Undercover Boss and thought after that episode that this place would be top drawer as a result. Sadly, not the case. We had two cheeseburgers and a side of fries and one soft drink. It was almost $25. The burgers were decent, but not spectacular. The real downfall was the building and overall general appearance. The ceiling was disgusting with dirt, grime and severe water stains. There was grease and grime all over the salt and pepper shakers, and the whole place was generally grimy. The place was pretty slow, and even taking into consideration that everything is cooked to order, it took 15 minutes to get our order. To top it all off, a message to corporate was totally ignored. Guess the show was simple \"entertainment\"."

Such a shame that Fatburger would allow Marisol to be a manager when she doesn't even care about the customers.\n\nNot even worth it. There's an In-N-Out right around the corner and if you really want Fatburger, go to the one inside the Santa Fe."

            "review": "I went to the Fat Burger location off of Rancho and Craig Road in Las Vegas, Nevada at about 8:05p.m. -8:22p.m. This is not the first time I've been to this location, and this is not the first time I have had horrible service here. This was by far the worst of all the instances, though. I went through the drive-thru and a lady, Marisol (name on receipt), on the speaker asked if she could take my order. I had but a second to think when she rudely and quickly said, \"Just let me know when you're ready to order.\" I said that I was ready to order & she did not respond. I said \"hello, can you hear me?\" Still no response. She finally came back on and said \"let me know when you're you ready to order\" I said yes, I have been  ready and started to place my order.  She cut-off me off and told me to hold numerous times while putting in my order. I get up to the window and ask if there was something wrong with the head set because it seemed like any time I started to talk I would get cut off. This lady immediately started to get aggressive with me and tell me, \"Well I told you to let me know when you're ready. I'm too busy here for you to decide what you want.\" (Now mind you, as I drive up to the establishment I noticed that there was hardly anyone inside as I pulled up to the drive thru & only 2 cars ahead of me -One car was at the window& the other was waiting behind him to get his food. There was no one behind me). I asked her if there something was wrong with the headset because I tried numerous tine to get her attention at the intercom. She became very unpleasant,  hostile, & very unprofessional. She  said she was too busy. After arguing with her and telling her she was cutting me off even when I tried to order and her denying this I finally just paid and waited for my food. When I asked for a manager she claimed she was a manager. This surprised me because I cannot believe anybody in their right mind would allow this awful woman to be a manager of anything. She is absolutely horrible with people (again, this isn't my first time dealing with this lady). I asked for her name and her manager's number. She said her name was on the receipt. She would not provide me with a ph# to her manager.  This whole situation appalled me. I am baffled! Her behavior and customer service is unacceptable! Shame on the owner and shame on Fat Burger for keeping someone like that around!"

            "review": "I'm a former employee here, I quit to work at the District Attorney's office so there's no hurt feelings & my review is as honest as it gets. It's disgusting especially if Marisol makes your burger. She under cooks it the patty & never wears gloves. She touches everything with her bare hands & she never washes her hands. She will blow her nose & put the toppings on your burger directly after with her bare hands. Her customer service skills are non existent. She has A LOT of complaints with corporate, complaints with the owner (Peter), & to the main shift leader Ashley. Why does she still works there is beyond me. She has made many customers loose their appetite & walk out. She also take chunks of meat off of your burger & will eat it, & I mean shove the whole thing in her mouth & chew with her mouth open & stuff just falls out of it. She has worked there for 13-14 years & still is horrible at what she does. She is constantly touching her hair, boobs, face, nose & mouth. The burger might look & taste fine but trust me. It's gross. Jose & Raul are great. They will make your burger like they are making it for themselves. & their customer service skills are phenomenal. They clean as much as they possibly can between taking orders, cooking orders, & bringing customers their food. Ashley the shift manager is the best, she trained me & taught me everything I needed to know. She's great with customers, cleaning, & cooking. Everything is pretty sanitary except for the cockroaches that make it in because Peter is cheap & doesn't want to pay to get the premises sprayed. So basically, if Marisol isn't there you're in the clear. If she is?? I'd recommend coming at a different time."

They clearly over charge from what's on the menu and management gets an attitude when you question it and tells you to call corporate. \n\nI ordered a kids meal which clearly said \"choice of burger, chicken fingers, or hot dog $7.59\". I ordered the burger with cheese and the cashier said without tax it would be $9 something so I opted out on the cheese. I pull up to the window (I was in drive thru) and the receipt still said $9.57 for a kids meal! I asked her again to explain why it was that much so she went and got a manager. After talking in circles saying that the burger was higher priced then the fingers,  she finally said it was because \"they charge extra tax\". On the receipt I had already been charged for tax so I asked why are we charged twice for tax??? She tells me to call corporate! \n\nThen to top it off the food was horrible. The burger was smashed and just thrown together. I used to love Fatburger and this location will make me second guess going to any other location again!"

            "review": "Perhaps the people at the drive-thru window are not the most engaging at this Fatburger location. Who cares? All their energy and efforts go into making a flavorful, juicy, fat burger. The fat content in this burger is superb -although I don't know the actual percentage of fat. Just know that the burger juice will run down your arm. \n\nThe burgers are dressed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions (ask for grilled), pickles, relish, and mustard. For an additional cost, you can add-on eggs, cheese, bacon, onion rings, or chili. While most fast-food establishments only offer beef burgers, Fatburger has always had turkey burgers on the menu too. They've even included vegetarian patties and glutten-free buns.\n\nThe burger sizes range from small to XXXL. For some reason, the small fat is no longer on the drive-thru menu - but it's still available. \n\nThe sides range from onion rings to skinny fries to fat fries and even chili cheese fries. I personally think it's silly for anyone to come to FATburger and get SKINNY fries. My go-to are the fat fries or the onion rings. There's also hand-scooped shakes, but they are not my favorites. Plus, the burger and fries alone will keep you pretty satisfied.\n\nNote: If there is no one else ahead of you, then it will take them approximately 10 minutes to prepare your order."

            "review": "There are some strong points when it comes to Fatburger. The music, for one, stands out in my mind. They always have good music playing. I like that you can watch your burger being made. It is like the ultimate in quality assurance watching everything the cook does. I like that the burgers are made fresh. There is a certain quality that you can taste in the freshness.  They do make a good burger. I admit that. My main issue with Fatburger is the price. In what world does it make sense to charge $10.99 for a burger, fries and a Coke at a fast food chain restaurant. I can get more food for the same price at a place like Red Robbin. A crazy price like $10.99 steered me away from the combo so I ended up with just a burger for over $6.00.   I guess I shouldn't complain too much though. It forced me to stick with my diet a little bit."

One time I pulled up to the speaker and started ordering and I had alot to order for a lot of people and the girl must have thought her mic was off but we heard her say \"OH MY GOD...\" like we we're annoying her because she has to do her job? So I said \"You know what, f**ck you, you stupid ass b*tch!\" I drove around to see the b*tches face and I flipped her off and went to burger king.\n***UPDATE****\nAGAIN WITH THAT SALTY ASS ATTITUDE!!!\nF*ck this place! My boyfriend and his friend went here last week and right when they pulled up to the drive through speaker, and this lady says \"how can I help you\", with out even giving him half a f*cking milli-second to respond, this b*tch yells \"HELLOOO!!??\" So my bf literally repeated exactly what I did when it happened to us the first time.\nHere's a tip for the two stupid b*tch employees of this Fatburger: IF YOU DISLIKE YOUR JOB THIS MUCH, GO BE A DEGENERATE SOMEWHERE ELSE, PLEASE."

It's clean and not too expensive. They are the place if you want a big burger. I was hungry so I got the size large with skinny fries and a chocolate shake. The large has to be around 8oz so that's a decent size for a burger when your hungry. My friend got herself the medium. The burger was nice and juicy and they make to order so everything was hot. I like that I can choose whats on the burger. The shake is so good but after the burger and fries it was hard to finish ha ha. Nothing to special about the fries. They weren't bad or have an amazing twist on them so if you like potatoes you will like them.\n\nFatburger gets 3 stars not only for living up to their name for fat burgers but also because they have good food and good service!"

I mean a double double animal style is good, but sometimes I just want other options and I like the fries a lot more here. My favorite is the turkey burger  with all toppings or try it with some egg. A plus that burgers come in sizes, sometimes that late I just want a baby burger. \n\nI didn't know there was even one near me until I drove to Big Dog Draft House. Yay!

Here's why.\n\nFOOD - 4 Stars\nI was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.\n\nAfter a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.\n\nI attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.\n\nOverall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  \n\nSee the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.\n\nWill I return?

I hadn't been a customer in going on 5 years, when I chanced upon this Fatburger on Rancho,,,,\n\nI ordered the xxl cheeseburger, chili cheese fries,  and a coke. I think the tab came to around $15, give or take a few.  Yep, it's a tad spendy,  but in my opinion you do generally have to pay for quality,  and for fair wages for the grill staff. I don't  mind, my understanding is  (  and maybe I'm  wrong,  but I don't think so ) they pay the workers better than most Fast Food burger stands.\n\nAnyway,  the burger and chili fries were AMAZING. I'll  be honest,  the sheer size and majesty of that xxl cheeseburger scared me a little  ( that doesn't happen often ) I wondered if id be able to \"kill the beast \" !   Huge. Juicy. Flavorful. Unique. A classic monster built burger. Did I mention Flavor ?  Abundantly flavorful.\n\nThe chili cheese fries are also amazing - because they are prescisely  what chili cheese fries are supposed to be, in my opinion. Thick tasty fries, smothered in flavorful chili with cheese. No beans. No fake cheese. No greasy limp fries. They were wonderful.\n\nLike I mentioned at the top,  I hadn't  been a customer for years. The last Fatburger I ate at was in Redondo Beach,  So Cal.  Then moved to Idaho,  then here to beautiful Vegas !

But my friends' mom sure did, and demanded another patty be made. \nI didn't go back for many years, until after high school, when I decided to try their veggie burger. Which turned out to be nothing but a Boca burger. For basically the same price as a regular one. It is fine that they offer it at all, but do not kid yourself into thinking that makes it ok to act like it is takes just as much time and effort as the meat patties, and therefore should be priced like them.

Great place to have fun and try a food challenge."

I order a burger NO cheese please, no relish please no mustard just mayo.\nWOW I get home which is quite a distance from this fat burger and guess what?\nMy burger has CHEESE stuck to the bread couldn't get it off.  If I ate it I would end up in the hospital.  MUSTARD all over the thing dripping out , IHATE mustard.  And Relish on the burger that it was soggy by the time I got home.  I HATE relish.  \nThis is more then 1 occasion where I have had this horrible experience at this location.  Today was the last time . I will NEVER go back here.  The staff is rude and I don't know if there is a language barrier or they are just flat out stupid but even the management lacks what is needed in this place.  Now I understand why they are so slow.

This is las vegas in the summertime, however I expect a little air conditioning. I figure eh' maybe they just need to turn the air conditioning up. The lady at the register tells me the air conditioning is broken. This was after I ordered 2 burgers, 2 fries 1 drink and a kids meal. It came up to $30. Jesus!, with a dining room that feels like an oven, you would think they'd just give you a freaking cup for free to prevent you from passing out! I must've really wanted this burger because I stayed and paid $30. UNTIL. . Until the cook and register worker began to argue. The cook began to curse and yell at her as she did him. Remember, I'm with my 7 year old. Neither one of them stopped and went to the back with the issue. My daughter and I were the only customers there!  I immediately asked for my refund. I already had my medium drink and my daughter had her kids meal drink. I asked to pay just for the drinks and a refund for the other stuff!  Do you know that my medium drink was $2.99 & my daughters drink that wasn't over 8 Oz was $3.99! I walked out so upset. ..never again"

It was almost $5 for a small burger that was the size of a microwavable burger you would get at AMPM. I was soooo disappointed when my guy friends ordered and ate the entire thing in about 3 bites. I had ordered the medium sized meal for a little over $10 and that included a burger twice the size as the small (yet about the same size of a regular in and out burger), steak fries and a medium drink. This was by far the most expensive fast food that I have ever purchased and tasted like I could get it at my neighbor's BBQ next week. They did not have any special sauces so I was bewildered to see how this was considered a top place to go to late at night. Particularly because there is a McDonald's next door and dollar menu was looking mighty fine after this disheartening meal. If you wanna save some money as well as have a good meal, I'd suggest you walk 10 feet away to the Mcdonald's next door and have a feast."

That's why in the eternal war of In-n-Out vs. Fatburger, I would take In-n-Out.\n\nBut for whatever reason, I really do like this particular giganto-burger.  There is the kitsch of the classic hamburger stand, the chrome signs and lineage behind the thing.  Add to that a very simple menu with lots of choices for your made-to-order burger.  And the ingredients are generally very fresh.  Some combination of that makes a burger that is a great experience, instead of just a placeholder next to a mess of fries.\n\nThis particular Fatburger is very hit or miss as for service times.  You can go in at three or four in the afternoon, or very late at night, and get your food in no time and find many places to sit.  Or you can go right at noon and be monumentally screwed.  This place doesn't scale well, so you might have to give up and move on to something else if you hit a rush hour.\n\nOh, and Mr. Pibb!  I always love that stuff."

It's hard to find that in fast-food nowadays.\n\nThe topping are always good and fresh. I really like that they put both sweet relish AND dill pickles on their burgers. It's unique and it tastes good.\n\nThe steak fries are also good. Hard to find at a fast food place nowadays. \n\nI always make sure to get Fatburger in at least once while I'm in Vegas."

The raging debate goes on as to which is better. Well duh, they are different!! They both have fantastic things to offer. Fatburger is fantastic, because a. they cook your food when you order it, b. you can get a fried egg on top of your burger, and c. you can fax in your order. Fatburger tastes so great and you get your choice of skinny fries, fat fries, or onion rings. Also, you can get a turkey burger which is so good!! I crave Fatburger once in a while and I absolutely cannot satisfy the craving otherwise."

And their chilli cheese fries are pretty great too.\n\nThis location is on the Strip, near the Hawaiian Marketplace. You'll pretty need to park elsewhere and walk here. There's an inside area and an outside area. Since people-watching on the Strip is a fav pastime of my mine, we opted for outside.\n\nThe outside space is a circular bar with bar seating and then several high-tops. It's a seat yourself place. Unlike other Fatburger locations, this one has waitresses. So when you sit outside, a server will come and take your order, bring you your food, and bring you a check.\n\nAlso unlike other Fatburger locations, since this one has a bar, you can get beer and mixed drinks. There's also a slushie stand where you can purchase those crazy yard-long tourist concoctions.\n\nThe service isn't much, but that's kinda to be expected.\n\nThe food, though, is awesome. I thoroughly devoured my delicious burger and all the chilli cheese fries. If you're looking for a good, cheap-ish burger, and want to partake in some excellent people-watching, this is the spot for you."

The music here has me \"all shook up,\" but it has my, \"r-e-s-p-e-c-t.\" I love it.\n\nFatburger also takes the complicated Johnny Rocket's menu, eliminates 75 percent of it, and makes you focus on how you want your burger and what kind of fries you want. Ordering is like, \"A-B-C, easy as 1-2-3.\"\n\nYou first pick the size of your burger. By size, it means in terms of patty size (2.5, 5.3, 8, 16, and 24 ounces). I am not sure who can eat a 2 pound burger, but until I weigh 400 pounds or I am high on government grade grass, I'll stick to the 5.3 ounce patty. Plus, there's only so much meat I can fit in my mouth.\n\nYou then pick the toppings. The burgers come loaded with fresh lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles (unless you say otherwise), but you get to add to your \"Fatburger\" experience with four extra toppings: cheese, bacon, chili, and/or an egg. Personally, I always roll with cheese and bacon. But under the influence of Las Vegas, I have added chili and an egg and it while it was different, it was still delicious. Yum. Burp. Fart.\n\nIf you want fries, you get two options: skinny fries or fat fries. The former is thin and crispy, and the latter are more like steak fries. Honestly, they are both really good. This is like having to choose between Betty and Veronica. And just like Archie, I can't truly commit to either option. \n\nSo I pick one or the other on each visit, but never both at the same time. You have to keep your options open and never let them know you are savoring both. Now that's \"true playa\" status, right there. Ya feel me?\n\nAlso, the milk shakes shakes are wonderful. You have try one at least once. They have five different flavors: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, Maui-Banana, and Oreo Cookies & Cream. You can't go wrong with either, but I suggest the vanilla, strawberry, and cookies & cream options. They are just so thick and creamy. That's what she said.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the service is stellar. But since it's set up is not a sit down restaurant, you don't need to tip. I guess Fatburger eliminated the tipping from Johnny Rocket's too. So you are left with great burgers, at a good price, in a cool environment.\n\nNeedles to say, I'm a fan of the African-American Johnny Rockets: Fatburger."

The parking was a breeze even if you do have to shoo people out of the way from crossing the driveway, which is nonstop.  Sorry, move the F out of the way, I'm coming in because I'm hungry enough to jump out and start chewing on one of you people.\n\nWe got in and there was no crowd.  I have to warn you here, FB is pricey, but we knew that already.  I just ordered for the one daughter, but my other one decided she wanted McDonald's; me too.  Woo-hoo, McDeath's is just next door!!!!  Sweet!\n\nSo got one kid situated outside at the open air seating, complete with open bar and misters.  Please, if you're a slow eater, sit away from the misters because they spray every other second and it does get annoying after a bit.  We went to the McD's next door and luckily avoided a big gang of folks who herded in.  \n\nIt was very nice sitting there people-watching out on the strip.  A nice calm evening with my teenagers, watching guys hand out X-rated flyers to passers-by.  \n\nLeaving is the same hassle as coming in because I had to darn near run over folks to leave because they don't care if you've been sitting there a while waiting to LEAVE!  Fortunately, I'm from back East and have a A-card on guerrilla driving.  MOVE!  So just be prepared to be a little proactive in that department."

I heard from a friend that their used to be only 3 sizes. I think that kind of simplicity would have be nice since I was quite baffled about which size to order. The burgers are all cooked to order which is nice but may cause a little bit of a wait. Cheese, chili, bacon, and egg are all chargable upgrades for the burger while other condiments are available for no additional charge. \n\nI was talked into the medium size burger. I added cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. It was too big. I got to the awkward point in my meal where I was satisfied to be done eating but only had a little bit of burger to go. I decided to avoid feeling the gut bomb and just tossed it. Along with my burger I ordered the skinny fries which turned out were not really all that skinny. I mean, they were pretty much standard size fries. I think I would have been better off if I topped them with chili or ordered the fat fries or onion rings instead. Lesson learned.\n\nAll in all, it is a decent option for late night eats. Especially if you want to avoid the more notorious fast food burgers, and of course, you have at least $10 to burn on a quick bite."

This might be a good burger if you're drunk, but it was pretty bad while sober.  While my friends ordered their own combinations I went with the medium Fatburger deal omitting cheese and onions on my burger and choosing the fat fries over the skinny fries.\n\nAlthough this place looks and operates very much like a fast food place it is not.  The burgers are cooked to order so definitely expect a wait for your food order to be called.  If you order a soft drink it's self serve.  That part I liked about Fatburger because I can control how little ice and how much soft drink actually goes into the cup.\n\nHowever, back to the burger.  My number was called and a worker delivered the burger tray to me.  The first thing I noticed was how small the burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw?select=2v29rPxqQNAWVXQlLTyqPQ) was compared to how large the portion of steak fries were.  I love thick fries which is why I selected the Fat Fries over the skinny ones.  These were a huge disappointment even though they were nice and meaty and fried to a perfect golden yellow color.  The fault was in the oil which tasted old, and because of that the fries didn't taste fresh.  You'd be surprised how big a difference there is just by changing the oil in a fryer.\n\nThe burger was not good either.  The burger patty was so overcooked no moisture existed within the meat.  I might have been happy had there even been a glistening of grease within, but nope, chewing cardboard is probably the best comparison.  The shredded lettuce while crisp had the odd taste of being stored in a refrigeration unit badly in need of a box of baking soda.  I don't mind that they use pickle relish instead of pickle slices but even that tasted old.  It's kind of like when you go to Costco and stock up on too much of something and store it until the taste begins to waver.  The pickle relish did not have a fresh snappy taste to it.  The only ingredients which tasted fresh were the tomato slice, the bun and the mustard.\n\nAt the least the service was good and the workers are friendly.  I can honestly say I won't be back at a Fatburger restaurant anytime in the foreseeable future."

To promote the new FOX TV show's Bob's burger, we were a bit confused at first thinking Fatburger is now Bob's burger, but it's only temporary. This is a good place if you want to grab a burger something quick besides McDonald's. It's a bit pricier than other fast food chains, but it was just fattening good. The burgers can get larger and larger, but the average size of their burger would be a medium since a small would like a tiny burger."

I had found memories of it from 8-years ago so I had to go and re-live it again.\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nI have to say the Late night service kind blows. Took 15 mins to get my order. Food came out in about 5 though. I guess this is how I remembered it.  The cashier took a long time doodling with the register, guest who had already been helped were coming back and trying to add things on or make changes.  It was a cluster F.\n\nIt took me 20 mins to get 2-small burger meals with drinks.  That irritated me but I was hungry.\n\nOn Second Look:\n\nIn my humble opinion, a good burger isn't defined by its gimmick or cult following - but rather it's patty.  This burger's patty was delicious and it complimented the rest of the crap on there.  The mayo and juices were flowing and got me to forget about the sub-par service I got while waiting for it.  I think it's whack that you have to pay extra for cheese, but hey this is America.  \n\nThe burger is better than the service.  Go there if you're hungry and want to grub out, but don't plan a trip around it.  They also have an outside bar now which is kind of lame."

Well, even the security guard didn't care...he wanted to see it too! \n\nAt any rate, I don't think anything happened.

People just leave their trash everywhere, and workers don't clean the areas regularly. You would think that if this restaurant is in some sort of tourist area like the Strip, they would have better service and a more tourist-catered atmosphere.

Forgetting to add onions or removing pickles etc. It was just completely wrong! Not to mention when we took the food up to the front, they said it's not their fault. So whose is it then and what are we supposed to do? Eat the food we did not order for? Um no thanks. When we gave it back, it exchanged several hands and all they did was remove the toppings that were supposed to be there and added the ones we wanted instead of making a new order. I'm all for not letting things go to waste but removing mustard is a little difficult since the bread absorbs it. I was so disappointed and angry I didn't eat it. I ate the skinny fries which was good. We also got Oreo cookies and cream milkshake which was super delicious. Hence why I gave them two stars instead of zero! \nWe came here around midnight but it was still busy. Prices are so expensive for a burger the size of McDonald cheeseburger and a kids size fries! The chairs and tables did not look wiped down and the trash was full. They have a lot of people working there so I was quite surprised to find it unkept. I did notice a few employees talking to each other or hanging by the bathroom. They really should delate the work to everyone. Maybe whoever made our orders was busy and needed help. Alas, I will not be coming back."

Well, Fattburger has mastered this process...inversely. The picture on the menu did not even begin to do justice to the mammoth, gigantic, huge, swollen, bloated mass of beef served greasily to me between the two unfortunate slices of bun forced to bear the weight of this thing. To make matters worse (or better, depending on one's POV), I had an additional patty, avocado and bacon added to the behemoth. \n\nThe ride back to the hotel was arduous. The aroma of the fried beast filled the car, beckoning to my hunger to stagger at the next red light and take a large bite from this beefy buffet. Wisdom prevailed, however, as I knew that once the beast was unleashed, it would go neither quietly nor cleanly back into its now saturated paper encasing. Must hurry. \nBarely, but successfully, I transported the package to my room, bag intact, where it was stripped down to its full, naked, delicious elegance. At last, we are alone, you and I. Come. \n\nWith all my hunger, I was still not able to finish. \"Fatt\" does NOT accurately describe the girth of this burger. Try as I might, a happy plate (bag rather) was not to be. Stomach capacity exceeded. Digestion activated. Food coma eminent. Not to worry. With a refrigerator and microwave readily available, we shall meet again very soon. Abdominal pain setting in. Oh Lord, please let me make it thru the night. \n\nIf you find yourself in Vegas, be sure to treat yourself to a Fattburger. I warn you, though. Do not underestimate this sandwich, for it is Fatter than its Fatt namesake. Also, I don't recommend more than one within a six month period. Your heart and grandkids will thank you. \n\n\"S\""

They have a self seat system which would work great if they had a way of knowing who just sat down. Usually once you order the waitress puts a number on your table, well here.. You sit to numbers already assigned to the table. It's just weird. You have to seat in a dirty table to get seats since it's outside on the strip but it might confuse the waiters since it looks like you just ate. We had to stop one of them and ask if someone can clear the table. The waitress took a very long time to get our order, bring the food and the check and I actually didn't mind the wait since we had good seats watching bystanders at the strip but I did see 2 different groups of ppl leave because they were never acknowledged. I didn't mind the waiting game but don't expect to sit and get your food fast, for those that are hungry it's definitely not a good place. In total, we waited about 10-15 to get someone to clear the table we got, another 15 min to get the waitress to take our drinks & order, another 5-7min for her to bring the drinks, 40-45 min to get our food."

I never had any reason not to go to In N Out for a good and fast diner burger. But one drunken night we were in some casino (Red Rock?) where there was conveniently located, a Fat Burger. I can't deny a good old fashioned burger drunk or sober so it was on. \n\nI'm not dumb or close minded so I wasn't gonna compare them to In N Out or any other burger. Not every burger wants to be an In N Out burger, some burgers just wanna be themselves damnit. I really like this fat guy! He's more than doable for me and I was an instant fan for sure.  \n\nPlain hamburger all day every day. I'm old school. I'd eat it between sandwich bread. The patty is hand formed and made to order and while the flavor is not out of this world it is close to out of the ballpark for me. Not bad at all and I have returned many times, mainly to this location (by default). \n\nNow speaking of this location, you'd think it's my favorite since there's a full bar outside. Nope. It's actually my least favorite and specifically because of the bar. The service out there sucks big baseballs. Doesn't matter if it's winter or summer they're always cold as winter. Bitches. I've never seen so many man bitches. So so sooo rude and grumpy and not taking any pride in the place like the other workers inside and at their other locations. That's what confuses me. The workers inside at the counter where you order your food are really wonderful just like the guys at the casino. The manager here was spectacular and even the cooks were upbeat. I felt extremely welcomed inside and then entirely snubbed outside. \n\nBut unless I'm feeling sensitive, it's the food that I really care about. I'd eat a decent burger from a Yankee fan I would. \n\nI totally approve of this being a drunken burger option. You will see me again and again. \n\nI've done the garden burger which I liked fine, but I love frozen garden burgers. I tried the turkey burger and it was fine too so I stick to beef since they're all fine. I prefer In N Outs protein burger because I like the full lettuce wrap style as opposed to a salad set up they have here. I like to add bacon and even cheese to my burgers sometimes and my favorite (besides plain) is adding an onion ring to a plain or cheeseburger. \n\nThe onion rings are what does it and keep me comin, really and truly. Home run baby. My fave I've found in burger land. I could eat their rings and only that all day but they taste better with a burger and a soda. I'm a sucker for the whole rodeo. Oh yum."

There's ample indoor and outdoor seating. \n\nIt's a typical Fatburger which means juicy burgers, and the fat fries (nice steak cut fries) are a must. This location is a bit pricey; now this just could be that I haven't been to a Fatburger since I moved away from LA, or their prices are just higher since it's on the strip. I'd go with the latter.\n\nThe wait is kinda ridiculous here. There was no one in front of me, and all I ordered was a cheeseburger and fries, and I waited like 30 minutes for my to-go order. Also, my burger came to me way before my fries, even though I was taking it to go, so I was pretty concerned my food was going to get cold. It's weird because loads of others got their fries before me, and I had to ask about my fries after my burger came, so I think they just kinda forgot part of my order.\n\nUltimately, this was an ok meal. I was in town because my boyfriend was at a convention, so I just wanted to grab something quick and take it back to the room since I was solo at the time. I just really wanted some fat fries though.\n\nIn Vegas, there's so many places that are better than this, and probably quicker (and maybe cheaper) that I'd prefer to spend my money elsewhere. \n\nThis location is convenient enough to the Tropicana Hotel and MGM though if you need a snack."

Because it was technically breakfast.  \n\nThere is a bit of a wait, but it was bearable - large burgers grilled to order take a bit of time.\n\nWhat came out was two huge patties, with the cheese, bacon and egg layered on top, resting on some greens, onions and tomatoes on the side.  Although it looked dry, it was juicy and flavorful.  The egg was cooked to over-hard, which was fine.  The bacon was just okay.  I knife and forked it easily (much easier to eat than In-N-Out's Protein style order).  I finished it all, but it was a lot of food - a very fat burger indeed.\n\nThe outdoor seating is enjoyable, more so for the view of the tvs by the bar, and the comely staff.  The people watching is a bit muted, from our time there.  Service is attentive.\n\nIf I wanted a gut-bomb of a breakfast/lunch, this could be a place I'd go back too."

This account is from my first and final trip to Fat Burger on the LV strip.\n\nThe second night of the girls' 21st birthday trip to Vegas was supposed to be our night to party hardy. Fat Burger brought all that to an abrupt halt. We spent the day at the Mandalay Beach, sun bathing and sipping on Long Islands and planning our evening. We then ate at Raffles cafe, drank some more, went to the room and cleaned up, drank some more, then hit up the Vodka Vault at Red Square, Ghostbar, Moon and Playboy and drank at each of those along the way. What... we were thirsty?\n\nHungry and desperate, we decide to get a snack before heading to the next clubs we had planned on, Tryst and Drais. Fat Burger put a halt on those plans because Tryst was scratched altogether and only half of us even made it to Drais.\n\nMistake: two of the four BZs ordered burgers bigger than they could handle.\n\nResult: instant food coma, cranky and bitchyness. The two wanted to go home an sleep, thus foiling our big late night plans (now that our taxi rides would cost double and the fact I had to give some creepy promoter my cell phone number, for the greater good of the group, to get free guestlist at Tryst).\n\nThe service was S L O W, albeit, a lot of drunk people were there just around 12 midnight and the cooks were probably backed up a little. We had eaten probably 6 hours earlier so we needed to refuel. We must've waited at least 20 minutes for our orders.\n\nOK, not so bad right? Wrong. One of the girls had severe implications from the FAT burger for the remainder of the weekend into Tuesday.... savage diarrhea and constipation. Trust, though it wasn't ME, we all had to suffer because she was queasy and cranky and was blowing up our hotel room's toilet at all times we were in the room. And boy, that bathroom door was paper-thin because we could hear it all. But we wont go there.\n\nFat Burger, thanks for being there, but never again. I'll stick with what I know and go to In-n-Out."

At places like these, I like to order my burger with basic toppings like lettuce and tomato and no sauces or cheese so I can see how the burger itself tastes. Mine was overcooked, the edges fell off from being poorly made, and it was too salty. If you're here with a larger group, remember what you ordered. When the food comes out, the server will have all the burgers on one tray and all the sides on another, as opposed to serving each person what they ordered individually.

Either way it was amazing had this nice juicy burger and will fill you up especially the XXXL burger and the sweet potato fried are the real deal as well.\n\nOnly thing that bummed me out was that i finished the XXXl burger and in the back i noticed they have like a wall for people that finished that burger. I wished someone would of told me so i could of gotten on that wall and also a certificate on it. But oo well i guess =\\\n\nOver great place, now what are you wating for go give it a try yourself."

I just assumed that you would go up to the counter, get the key and do your thing. But nope, the guy walked back w/ me, unlocked the door and off he went. The thing that was also weird was that it was a multi person bathroom.\n\nWe walked in, we had never been here before, and it was a straight shot to the cash register. The way this place is set up is awkward and if there would have only been 3-4 people ahead it would have put almost back to the door. I could see how during busy times it would suck cause you would be stuck outside while standing in line.\n\nWe got up to the register and looked for a menu, there was none. All they had was a little laminated sheet that told you what the burger toppings were. They have a digital menu, but it is not helpful. In my opinion the screen moves waaaaaay too fast, you see something that looks good but then the screen changes. It a pain cause while you are trying to figure out what you want, you also dont want to hold up the line either.\n\nWe finally decided on our order and purchased 3 cheeseburgers, and order of fries, 1 soda and 1 strawberry shake and it cost around $45!!!\n\nThe burgers were VERY good though. The buns were butter grilled, the burger was very juicy and had a good flavor. I especially loved the crispy char on the ring of the burger. The fries were cooked to perfection. They give you the option of steak cut fries or thin...we opted for the thin ones. My strawberry shake was creamy and had chunks of strawberry in it. I am not sure what I was expecting in regards to the shakes. A lot of places I have ordered strawberry shakes from have just used the flavoring, so I was thinking it was going to be something along the lines of that. I am glad that I was wrong...these shakes were REAL ice cream and REAL strawberries. The shake took a little while to make, but it was totally worth it.\n\nI would consider coming back here. The service was great as was the food. The price was just a little much for no more than what we ordered. If this was a sit down type of place and included a side and/or drink it would have been different. They were also running a Groupon deal, but it wasnt valid for this location."

This place wasn't bad, however I prefer In-N-Out over Fatburger if I were to live in the western US. If only the In-N-Out in Las Vegas was actually on The Strip proper...but I did plan to explore more next time I'm in Vegas.\n\nI had two medium Fatburgers with onion rings for one of them. Believe it or not, the onion rings here are much better than the burgers. I love o-rings that are huge in size, and the fact the onions were also large in size (it's not just batter). This place has both aimed spot on! As for the burgers...I like the fact there are different sizes for the burgers, cause there's no way I'm eating a XL. I also like the fact the burgers are lean beef, so it's less unhealthy for you, although that might have contributed to why I find the burgers not as juicy as In-N-Out.\n\nAgain if I had to choose between Fatburger and In-N-Out, it's In-N-Out all the way. However Fatburger is also a great choice for those Vegas folks who don't wanna leave The Strip and want something that's not a buffet or splurge restaurant for a change."

Even this Texan isn't stupid enough to get that! I only got the large (8oz) fat burger with bacon, cheese, and fried egg on top along with fat fries and a diet coke. haha ok I kid on the diet coke. I enjoyed every artery clogging morsel and dare I say it was better than Whataburger?!?!"

Cheese does not automatically come on the burgers, you have to pay an extra dollar for it. There are other add ons you can get for an extra charge as well. It also comes a la carte so sides are separate. Two burgers (one large and one medium) and a side of fries came out to almost 30 dollars."

A gaggle of transvestites were carrying on and one noticed me, thinking I was trying to photograph them. I assured her/him I was really taking photos of the establishment.\n\nI shared a turkey burger ($5) with my friend which wasn't bad, to start. I took a bite, chewed thoughtfully, took a few notes, then proceeded to douse mine in Tabasco. It's no In-N-Out, but it'll feed you. (I heard that I should get one of their specials, and top it off with a fried egg... next time!)"

Fatburger is one of those places that just tastes great along with their fried. This year when we went, they added a FATBAR which has an outdoro bar, outdoor seating and table service instead of the inside, where you place your order after waiting in line and what not. the inside portion still exists but the outside is a very nice new add on. Love the burgers and love the 24 hours! try to eat there 2-3 times in my 5 day stays!"

Questa vuota \u00e8 costata 19.99 dollari... Piena costava 29.99... Confrontate con altro prezzi che piene le davano a 15 dollari...

Tutto sommato il sevizio \u00e8 veloce e le ragazze molto gentili e disponili riguardo le richieste! Se volete fare uno spuntino veloce questo \u00e8 il posto adatto!!!

Boyfriend had the XL burger on his first visit with egg - it was huge! He couldn't finish it and he's had a 1lb burger and a 1/3lb burger in one sitting once in fuddruckers with no problem. But fatburger defeated him!\nChips/fries are great and the oreo milkshake. Only thing is they asked me first time if I wanted whipped cream on top to which I said no, but did't get asked second time. Didn't think anything of it unitl it arrived with a load of cream on top. yikes, not a fan of cream! \n\nI'm just gutted we couldn't find it on our first night! I had read it was behind the MGM, which it really isn't! So went off in the direction of Hooters looking for it (obviously wrong way!). Being hungry in a new city, which was unbelievably hot is not a good combo when all you've read about for months before going away is fatburger and other similar  burger joints and you just don't want the usual mcdonalds.\n\nIf only we had one in the UK!"

It does take a few minutes to get your food since it is cooked to order.  The staff here are always friendly and the food is always good.  It is super unhealthy, but damn, it's a good burger.  They also have really tasty onion rings which the husband always gets with his burger.\n\nThe restaurant is not the cleanest, as it is right on the strip and I think does a fair amount of business, but if you can get over that it's fine.  I used to be a huge In N Out fan, but they have gone down hill in the last few years and are more like a cheap cardboard burger with fries that are lacking.  Fatburger blows In n Out away!  \n\nBetween the burger and fries it's usually too much food for me, but I don't care, it's worth it.

This is in front of the Fat Bar which is the patio portion of Fat Burger.  I'm not reviewing this as part of Fat Bar, because the sign says verbatim \"Welcome to Fatburger's Las Vegas Slushie Bar.\"  I always loved Fat Burger.  It's a big fat burger with fat fries.  Before they came to Reno, I always hit the Fat Burger here like a tradition.  Now, let's get back to what's important.  There are one or two hot women in bikini's in the front hawking over-sized margarita-flavored alcohol slushies.  The Las Vegas strip is super expensive as far as drinking.  I paid $20 for a drink to get into the Haze Night Club (it's free to get in so long as you buy a $20 drink coupon).  That got me a watered down vodka and Coke.  Yuck.  Then I paid $10 for a Sierra NV 12 oz beer.  After $30, I wasn't even close to feeling buzzed.  For $25 (using a $5 coupon) I got 55 oz of slushi strawberry margarita-flavored booze.  I expected it to be watered down a lot, but to my surprise, BANG!  It was LOADED with tequila!  I got drunk immediately.  So be careful.  I later blacked out.  I got the small guitar.  I know, it's totally touristy, but when in Vegas, be a lame tourist and live it up.  Trust me, the guitar gets you attention.  I had women taking photos of me with them and then they'd wear the guitar and get more photos.  Can you say chick magnet?  Too bad I was toasted by then and barely remember the whole ordeal.  None-the-less, the bikini beach bartenders were super friendly, and I'm telling you, there's nothing like drinking 55 oz of booze from a plastic guitar on a public street.  Unfortunately, it was the worst tasting margarita or dacquiri or whatever the hell they want to call it.  It was like pure corn syrup after the ice all melted.  It was hard to drink, but basically it was just a vehicle to help get the tequila down so don't expect craft, natural ingredient juice here.  Just swallow it down and get drunk.  I'm a craft cocktail snob, but this place isn't about craft cocktail numb nuts.  It's about the bikini bartenders, the guitar, and getting wasted on a public street in Vegas, and then blacking out."

I have a thing about hotel food (don't), so I yelped to see what was around.  And lo and behold....RIGHT across the street from the Aria shows a Fatburger!  Hadn't eaten at one of these since I moved from LA, so off I went.\n\nTypical setup - stand in line to order, get a #, go sit and wait.  But....the ordering....ahh.....first, a REAL burger, cooked to your specs.  Choice of size.  Choice of REAL cheese.  Choice of bacon.  Choice after choice after choice.  You know...like a REAL burger place (kinda knocks In-N-Out out of the category). \n\nOrdered the basic burger w/swiss and bacon (I know, I know...that's so unlike me...(cough)), along with a small fries and a diet coke.\n\nReceived my meal about ten minutes later...and it was JUST like I remembered them...divine.

It does have a somewhat fun atmosphere if you're into that workers being loud, but that's not my type of crowd. \n\nWe got a XXXL Burger, fat fries and a Chili Cup and brought it back to the hotel. The burger was huge, but it was over $9. It was difficult to pick up so we basically just took it apart. My friend ate most of it, but from what I had it was a decent burger -- better than the typical fast food restaurants available to new yorkers at least. I have yet to try In-N-Out, so I can only compare it to places like McDonald's or Burger King. The chili was really salty, but we ate it with the fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. \n\nThe food is better than your average fast food restaurant, i.e. Wendy's, McDonald's, etc but it's not as clean, so I'm not comfortable eating there and the clientele's too rowdy at night, but I'll gladly get it to go."

I used to think In-And-Out was the hidden fast food burger gem on the west coast...but Fatburger passed them up!  \nFast forward to last week.  I was back in Vegas with a few friends and one of my friends had a Triple King Burger (three 1/2 pound patties).  If you finish this monstrosity, they give you a free t-shirt and take your picture to put up on the wall.  He finished it and got his picture taken.  They were out of t-shirts though.  \nA few nights later, we went back.  I ordered a QUAD King Burger (trip-King + 1 extra patty) to one-up my friend.  After consuming TWO POUNDS of delicious hamburger, I instantly regretted my decision.  The burger was awesome (as usual), but I was disgustingly full.  They were still out of t-shirts, and their camera was broken too, but I didn't care.  Right after we left, one of the cooks came outside after me to shake my hand.  I LOVE FATBURGER!"

Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back!

Fatburger allows you to order a burger with plenty of different toppings, all which makes a burger tasty and unique.  Not a perfect burger joint, but definitely a good burger joint to patronize."

Anyway, inside, we were greeted by the same group of people. Drunk club goers, dude-bros and many other interesting characters. The girls in front of us were leaning all over the registers screaming \"I want salt on my burger!\"...by the time we were served, the guy was either deaf or just a little slow. It took us 5 minutes to order fries and a shake. He kept asking, \"you want vanilla shake??VANILLA??\"\n\nWe set up camp in the corner by the window, and people watched till our food came. One fellow was using his soda cup as a barf receptacle. The girls who wanted salt on their burgers were now shouting about who's boyfriend was who's. When our food came we gulped down the tasty shake, and munched on our fries and discussed where to go next at 5:30am. \n\nDefinitely one of my favorite Las Vegas experiences!"

Can't say that this place is an exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nFirst off, it's a Fatburger with a bar -- an outdoor bar. I would have never guessed you could get fat AND drunk here.\n\nSecondly, the burgers here are massive and come in four sizes: L, XL, XXL, and XXXL. I had the XXL, which was $11 without a drink and fries -- if you want a small combo, you'll have to pay an additional $6 for that. I guess rent here is that ridiculous. They even have a food challenge here. I can't remember the deets, but the XXL was large enough for me. I couldn't take on the XXXXL (or whatever it was) Challenge.\n\nThe meat was nice and juicy and flavorful, something we don't see much in Ohio with burger chains. As I suggested earlier, everything is MASSIVE. One burger and a cup for tap water should be enough, but if you insist on the fries keep in mind that your wallet is going to feel much lighter after you eat. With many burgers this size, I think to myself \"do I have to finish this?\", but not here.\n\nWhile I have a beef to pick with the prices here, I will be coming back my next trip to Vegas."

I would put them above most fast food spots, but I don't think they top in n out.  I love the fact that you can get steak fries (the best choice), but the regular fries are better than average as well.  Generally you have to decide how much meat you want and that will determine the cost and size of your burger (they also have some other meat choices as well).  They have other toppings too, which actually makes their burgers somewhat customizable.  I seem to remember even getting asked what type of cheese I wanted?!?!? Bring on the cheese choice revolution.\nI found the prices reasonable for LV strip, and the wait (at 1:00p on a weekday) was about 25 minutes.  Don't expect a seat though, as the dining area was pretty crowded the whole time I was there and it almost certainly is worse at night.\nI didn't find the staff to be *fun* like other reviewers did, but they were certainly doing their job and that is all I really ask of anybody.\nI imagine if you show up at night you need to be prepared for a totally different scene that is less focused on the food and more on finding something to soak up all that margarita by the yard or random neon colored alcohol beverage.  I may visit at night just to see what the spectacle looks (and also 24 hours, relatively quick is better than almost every other option out there)"

I think I only tasted one bite of onion though. If it weren't for In-N-Out, I'd say this place definitely outranks any franchised burger joint. But, a true fan stays loyal. In-N-Out forever. However, Ice Cube, I do know what you mean. I too, would want a fatburger 2 in the morning...only in Vegas."

I passed by this place a few times, with no intentions of going inside.  At around 3AM on a Wednesday, after a great time on the strip, was heading back to the hotel, and I was hungry.  It was practically empty inside.\n\nI'm so happy I went here!!  I had the Small (Baby Fat) Fatburger with cheese, bacon and an egg. DELICIOUS!!  I'm drooling right now...  The skinny fries were great too.\n\nI even made a trip to In-N-Out sometime the next day - my first time there actually.  Although it was good, I preferred Fatburger, and made more trips here instead!\n\nThe location was convenient, and the people that worked there were really nice, funny actually.  People have said that they have encountered shady customers.  However, I went there a few times between 1-4AM, and all I saw were tourists, like myself. Maybe I was just lucky.\n\nI miss you Fat Burger!"

I visited this location and the cashier was so nice, however I couldn't understand why she was the only person working the register when 10 - 12 other employee's were standing around and just talking and having a great time. I found that to be really rude because my group had a lot of people and the ordering process might have went faster if another employee cam to the register. \n\nI ordered the turkey burger and steak fries. I was really please with the way the burger turned out. The turkey was not dried out or flavorless. However the young lady that dropped the burger off to the table had a massive amount of weave in her head. I am not knocking her for that but if your going to serve food I personally think you should have all of that hair in a bun to avoid it from touching my food. Overall the food was really good and the cashier was great but the other areas discussed needs lots of improvement."

Would visit again.\n\nFood - 6/10\nService - 10/10\nAtmosphere - 8/10\nWait Time - 8/10\n\nStopped in because I heard this place was decent. Ordered a 1/3# breakfast burger (burger, egg, bacon, cheddar) and they had an advertisement for free fries with a purchase of a draft beer, so naturally, I jumped on this offer. We ended up getting charged for the fries, went back up, the cashier had recognized us and his mistake, apologized and admitted he got a bit flustered with the line that was forming behind us. The fact that he straight up admitted he made a mistake, without trying to dance around the issue, really made me appreciate the service here. So he called over the manager and they were going to refund us, which I know can be a pain, so I asked if we could get onion rings instead, and the manager (without hesitation) said yes. FANTASTIC SERVICE. The onion rings were brought right over.\n\nI'm pretty picky when it comes to breakfast burgers. I can say this wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was better than some of the worst. The meat could've used more flavor, but regardless, a good burger!\n\nIt was a tad bit expensive though. For 2 breakfast burgers, 1 beer, and fries was $40..."

The fries are some of the most delicious fries ever.  I just had some, and I kind of want some more already.  They're so perfectly cooked - crunchy on the outside without satisfying any of the soft interior (I'm referring to the skinny fries).\n\nHowever, minus 1 star because I have to say that it unfortunately reminds me greatly of another burger joint that I love much more (rhymes with mud suckers).  I know it's not fatburgers fault, but it is unfortunate that the burger reminds me too much of another (better) one I've already tried.  Please save the hate mail, loyal fatburger fans.. this is my personal and honest opinion.\n\nMinus another star because I asked for mayo on the side and I found my burger fully dressed with mayo in my burger.  I could have let it slide, but my friend also asked for a burger without some of the condiments, and unfortunately his burger also came as if he has asked for a burger with everything.\n\nI will recommend this place though - if you're in the area.  It isn't good enough for me to drive all the way to the strip and park in a club parking lot and have to walk around a bunch of drunk jackasses eager to prove how macho they are to some girl who is not even interested in them and deal with parking specifically for it though."

Open late, right on the strip, not too overpriced, great food, all the good stuff.\nSo its 3am and we've been walking the strip and most like several beers in. I'm in town for a convention and havent had a really good meal since i arrived. The co-worker i'm with says \"We gotta go to Fat Burger\". Being from the East Coast i had never heard of it, so I decided to give it a shot. Place looks nice enough, will have to go without beer for a half hour. I get in line, look at the menu, and decide the burger is where its at. I get up front and see a sign \"Free fries with purchase of beer\". What? They serve beer here too?  Hence the 4 up to 5 stars. So the burger was fantastic, and really hits the spot at that time in the evening/morning. The fat fries were just regular steak fries, but man those burgers hit the spot.\nLooking forward to going back my next time out west."

Okay, you do have a nice bar set up outside...this is cool also, even for a person that does not drink such as myself.  Yet, your prices are crack head crazy!\n\nI must admit, the burger is not already made, already pressed meat filler substance that most chain restaurants serves you.  You had real beef on your metal tray, and you can taste the difference.  The strawberry banana shake, and the chocolate banana shake was both awesome.  Fresh ingredients in those most definitely, which you verified by not having all the banana completely shaken in your shake.  Yet, you charge for everything.  You want both buns, another 50 cents. Cheese is $1, straw for your shake is $1, use the restroom is $1, and looking in the direction of the bathroom is 50 cents.  \n\nThey made sure to have some of the decorum in a retro style diner set up, which was nice for nostalgia sake.\n\nAll in all, I think you should try this place at least once just to form your own opinions, but I know that my wallet will rarely make my way to this place, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING that there are buffets that cost about the same price as a cheeseburger combo with the works!"

After all, we had a checklist for things to do while in Vegas, and our list was basically a list of the 7 sins. Gluttony, check.\n\nIt was all very wrong, but felt so right."

The shake is also pretty good.  It had a huge heaping of whipped cream on the top that I enjoyed.\n\nThe bad, the price is insane.  I got a turkey burger, chili cheese fries, and a milkshake.  Total was $20.  At In N Out, that same meal is $10.  I don't know if it is more expensive, since I'm in vegas, but holy cow.  Also, I was not impressed with the fries.  They were definitely not worth the calories.  I got the skinny fries and ended up throwing them out.  With In N Out I'm scrapping the bottom of everything to get the last remnants of cheese.

I haven't visited those locations. I'm really glad this location isn't too far from our apt. :) They have a frequent visitor card thing. You get a stamp for each fatburger you purchase, and it's double stamps on Tuesdays. Fill up a card and you get a free Fatburger!

If taste means that much and you cannot possibly go 1 extra  mile north up Nellis to get to an equally flavorful contender at In-N-Out, then knock yourself out spending that discretionary gas money on a Fatburger special. Otherwise, move on down the road in either direction (In-N-Out to the north, Original Tommy's to the south) and get a competitive burger with gas money in tact. The true rating for me on this is actually 2.4 stars for demerits re: location, price and not compensating for surrounding competition..."

When we got our food which was made unusually fast (when Fatburger makes everything fresh) we noticed the burgers were actually cold. So we parked, went inside and asked if everything could be made over since the fries would be cold by the time the new burgers were made. The shift leader then grabs their phone and walks in the back and has us waiting for about 10 minutes. We asked another employee what the hold up was and she tells us that they need to get approval from the owner. WHAT?? We hadn't touched the food at all. I've never seen or heard anything like this. But what happened next is really strange. He comes back and says they can remake the burgers, but not the fries. \n\nAt this point I say I want a refund. I give him my card which he has for about 15 minutes. Once he comes back, he has a receipt for me to sign so the refund can go back on my card. The amount he has for the refund WAS LESS than the amount they debited. THIS FATBURGER FRANCHISE ARE THIEVES. \n\nThis FATBURGER was dirty inside, they weren't even using Fatburger brown logo'd bags for the food and they seem to really lack franchisee health and quality standards. Also, to clarify they kept the money they owed me (A LITTLE OVER $8) with no concern or available recourse for me as a customer. \n\nI've contacted Fatburger corporate to inform them that this Fatburger rips-off customers and they're ruining the Fatburger name and should be terminated as a franchisee."

It was also very juicy and cooked just right. Each and every fry was golden brown and had a nice crunch to them. I just hate under cooked fries and these were not. These were wonderful.

I guess the extra egg part didn't get heard for his. Still, the chili cheese was he was mainly after. \n\nTwo very different burgers and was the only order on the pas....really, it wasn't hard to make them correct. I think it's a lack of attention to detail since the order wasn't made right (it was dry, overcooked) and then  the burger wasn't made even to what the ticket said. Sure we can have went back to get a refire, but to go back to the restaurant and then wait again for new burgers- we didn't have the time. Went for fast food since we needed fast food. \n\nThe BF was sick. When he's sick he can drive me nuts about food and when food isn't right and he is hungry and sick he gets so pissed and then makes him feel worse. \n\nWhat an awful dinner this was.\n\nI have been a loyal fatburger fan since I was a kid. It actually was my reward for a good spelling test in elementary since I loved it so much. As an adult, I prefer grabbing a turkey burger with egg over any other fast food burger. Most of the LV casino locations really don't care. This is not the first time I felt it was less than stellar (usually overcooked) but this was the worse service so far.\n\n After tonight, I think I am done being a fan. Goodbye Fatburger. Hello In-N-Out, thanks for being consistent."

I'll admit it is a bit pricey for a breakfast sandwich (they charge .99 extra for cheese). We usually get the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and a drink, for 3 of us and it costs right around $20. If I would get my lazy butt out of bed earlier I would definitely go through a much less expensive Burger King or McDonald's drive thru, but when you're stuck for 3 hours in the morning at Santa Fe this option isn't bad. The sandwiches are actually quite tasty. The ladies that work there are always very courteous and quickly get to work on my order. My reason for taking 2 stars is the price and lack of variety."

To get me back to the machines quickly I opted for a quick lunch at Fatburger, located in the casino's food court.\n\nA pleasant young woman with a screeching cartoonish voice took my order. She advised me to sit at one of the food court tables and wait eight minutes for a freshly cooked burger. Eight minutes later I heard her scream........my burger was ready. It was a tasty, fresh burger on a typical burger roll. I could not distinguish it from any other fast food burger, although I do give this franchise credit for making fresh burgers to order. The burger did the job and sated my hunger. I did think it was a little overpriced, however.\n\nThe most surprising aspect of my visit to Fatburger was the Vanilla Milk Shake I ordered with Whipped Cream. It was outstanding.  It was delicious, with a beautiful consistency. I look forward to enjoying it again!\n\nThus.....I've added a half star to my review to praise this remarkable shake."

I was hoping to take a picture of said employee because it was a hot day (102 degrees) and I was ready to unload some insults at someone.  Instead, we have a cool, nice, and efficient counter guy.  Did they have the nerve to fire above midget?  Or did he leave for a better paying gig? Aw dang, normal hard working people are so...boring.  So, anyway, I settle for a medium burger with the works but no egg or chili.  My brother had the same thing\n\nI wasn't there when the previous yelpers had a bad experience.  But we clearly enjoyed ourselves. Based on those previous yelp reviews, I also didn't want to get food poisoning so I watched them make it from start to finish.  To my surprise they were actually very clean on a Saturdahy night at 7 PM.  In 10 minutes, the guy brings out our tray.  Now I am a clean table freak at time.  So of course, I had to wipe down the table we were sitting in even though the table looked clean.  I do this all the time. \n\nSo I take a picture and take a first bite of the burger.  Very good...hot patty nicely grilled with a pile of letttuce, tomato, mayo, and mustard.  The bun was grilled, too which is important to me.  Who wants floppy buns?  \n\nThen I take a taste of the crispy, greasy, sweet onion rings.  Its was a 3.5 burger but 4.5 onion rings this time.  Both were just cooked and just fine.  While people in the casino said words like \"Da!! I lost my money\" we said, \"Yum, we're gaining calories with a Fatburger fat burger\" and it was good. With a soda, it's over 12 dollars, a lot more pricey than In N Out, a 5 star place for me most of the time.  This was a 4 star trek for some decent burger and 0-rings, and hope my luck doesn't run our either with the good burgers and casino if I ever gamble."

She told us that she gave us what was available and didn't want us to wait any longer.  She dropped the platter on the table and walked away.  I guess we did better than other people who ordered onion rings, they got the same skinny fries and were told that there was something wrong with the onion rings and that's all they had.  I guess the other people figured the same thing, the wait was so long why even bother fighting it.  The staff didn't even bother offering a refund for the extra dollar it costs for the onion rings!\n\nThe meal was ok, but not worth the 30 minutes it took to get part of the order.  The last straw was when my wife pointed out the water stained roof tiles above us.  They were painted black, but now some of the tiles had obvious water damage and one even looked like it had white mold growing on it.\n\nI don't ever expect to be coming back, there are just too many choices out there, especially at their prices!"

I think that is impressive since it's nothing worse than getting a burger and not liking what's on it and picking at it instead of eating it. The burger isn't just a regular patty. It's like they take a handfull of hamburger meat, season it and throw it on the grill. Got a shake with the meal and that was just as tasty! \n\nI am a new fan of this place!"

So earlier today I was craving for a burger and passed by this one and saw it as a good opportunity to try one. Horrible experience. \n\nFirst, the food here was ridiculously overpriced. Call me cheap, but I consider paying close to $15 for a burger, a drink, and onion rings grossly overpriced. Secondly, the girl that took my order got my order wrong and didn't even give me the fries I ordered. Third, the girl that gave me my food first asked me if I wanted ketchup, to which I replied \"yes please\", and then proceeded to hand me a bag of food that I later found out contained no ketchup whatsoever. Fourth, the food itself was quite mediocre, at best. The burger was dry, and the onion rings were drenched in oil and tasted more like oily onions than onion rings. The only decent thing was the sweet green tea.\n\nLastly, and this is the major one, this place gave me gastroenteritis. For those who don't know what this is, it's the stomach flu. How do I know it was Fatburger's fault? because it was the first and only thing I ate today, and I didn't even have dinner last night. It started with some major diarrhea, led to severe stomach cramps, and ended with me in the ER at 3 in the morning. I can almost guarantee you that Fatburger either didn't cook or wash the meat thoroughly or some part of the food was contaminated. \n\nIf you don't like expensive burgers, getting your orders wrong, dry burgers, oily onion rings, diarrhea, or stomach cramps via the stomach flu, then I HIGHLY suggest you stay away from this place like the plague."

Photos of everybody from Miles Davis to T-bone Walker on the walls, and you're playing this crap?  It got worse.  We ordered at the counter, and while we were waiting another couple came in, ordered, and then sat outside to wait for their food.  We watched the young woman who took the orders deliver food to them, and suspected that she had given them our order.  sure enough, a couple minutes later, counter girl came to our table and said \"I'm sorry, I accidentally gave them your order.\"  Really easy to see how confusing it could have been with a total of four people in the entire place!  When our food did arrive, I found a puddle of grease at the bottom of my order of half-cooked onion rings.\nSad.

The cook told her he needed to pay cause his food was ready and she instead of taking care of him proceeded to make a milk shake.

Should have just driven away, worst, liquid, overpriced shake ever. \n\nLesson learned, if you are going to have diet cheat treat, go to in n out and pay half for a MUCH better shake. \n\nThis will be the final time I ever give Fatburger my business. They have failed to impress me every time I have tried them with their service (or lack therof), prices or food. I'm sure they'll go out of business soon."

My family went to this location because after shopping at Smith's Food and Drug we received a coupon for a free medium fatburger with the purchase of a combo meal. The coupon has an expiration date of 12-31-2015 and is not the only coupon on the receipt tape. Upon ordering about $16 worth of food I mentioned the coupon. The woman working the drive thru asked if I had the whole receipt. I said no , I clipped your coupon. She said she won't take it because she needs to see the date on my receipt. I asked why since there is an expiration date for the Fatburger coupon and dots signifying to \"clip\" the coupon. The coupon doesn't mention that the whole receipt needs to be present for the offer. The coupon is also on a roll with other coupons for non affiliated businesses. Fatburger are you telling me that if I want to use your coupon I better use it before I use the other coupons? If I had eaten at Brooksy's the week before And their coupon was gone you wouldn't honor your coupon since the original receipt isn't intact? Your restaurant was dead and your drive thru empty. Are you really in a position to turn away coupons you personally put out? Hopefully this is the mistake of a poorly trained employee. I wouldn't doubt it considering when we ordered a number 1 combo (exact words) she asked if we wanted to make it a combo! I've never been a huge fan of Fatburger since this location seems to lack any sort of customer service."

I was hoping for something along the lines of a Sonic pineappple milkshake (BOMB, btw), but it wasn't.\n\nYou get your choice of skinny or steak fries.  I got the skinny, and noticed they have an extra coating of crustiness, like Burger King or McD's.  I like them better than In 'N Out fries, although I worry about what makes up that extra coating.\n\nI asked them if they could do a 'protein style' burger without the bun, and they were happy to do so.  They basically put the patty on top of all the fixin's, and put the whole thing in a cardboard container (like the fry containers at In 'N Out).  \n\nI like that they have different Tabasco sauces for you to choose from too, and saw a bottle of A-1 Steak Sauce on the counter too.\n\nThis place wasn't busy, maybe because of Five Guys.

However, when I walked in, there was a gentleman at the grill wiping it, lights were dimmed and chairs put up. I asked if they are already closed and he replied almost,I then asked if I could order something since it was only 15 after 9 and they are not due to close till 10pm.. instead of responding he turns and goes to the back....So I waited (mainly just to see if he was going to come back or wait, hoping I would leave) he then comes back out about 3 minutes later and I ask the same question...then I ask to speak to a manager he points to the a wall and says you can call.  I said what is the manager's and is there a number or card....he replies no...I again ask for the manager's name and he replied Eduardo.  I said, I saw another employee in the back when I walked in can I speak to him. The 2nd employee comes out and tells me he was cleaning the bathrooms and he was the acting manager.  He nonchalantly apologized for the other reps behavior and asked if he could help me...Sir, you have turned off the lights, picked up all the chairs, turned off all the grills and have bathroom hands...what exactly is it that you think you can do for me at this point?  I am in complete shock at the lack of anything that this place of business had to offer me, which was nothing.  I then ask him for the manager's name and info, he says I am the manager, I then said, the other gentleman just said it was Eduardo, he then said, \"Eduardo is the GM I am acting manager\".  I said, \"can I please have the GM's info please\", he again stated, in his nonchalant manner, \"he will be in tomorrow\".  I know it's the holiday season and everyone is trying to get home to their families but if your sign says open and your doors are not locked and I walk in, don't ignore me, just hoping I will go away, that is just horrible!!

I haven't ever asked for a full refund before but there was no way I was spending my money on this service. I asked for a refund and the fry cook and cashier got an attitude with me.

I'm a low carber so I'll get it served in a dish with no bun. I love the beef here and I love how it is cooked in all of its own delicious burger grease. Sit at the counter and talk to the cooks while they prepare your dinner, and order a soda that you can keep refilling yourself at the self-service soda bar (this location has Coke Zero and Gold Peak brewed tea, both make my tummy happy). \n\nI love Fatburger's handmade milkshakes too (and their skinny and fat fries) but I've had to give those up due to all the carbs. But if you can, try their skinny chili cheese fries, they are the best. They melt shredded cheddar on them which is the key to good cheese fries. There are also a long list of possible toppings you can get on your Fatburger from relish to fried eggs to bacon and grilled onions. They also make grilled chicken and veggie burgers too, and both are good. You can also get your burger on a whole wheat bun or wrapped in lettuce.\n\nEverything is cooked to order here so once you order you are given a number. They'll deliver the food to your table. Plan on spending about $25 for 2 people; it's not exactly cheap but it's convenient and the food is always fresh, hot, and served with a smile.

I quickly discovered, however, that Fatburger, this location in particular, is a very mixed bag.\n\nFirst and foremost, the biggest flaw: NO DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. In this day and age, I didn't think they were still making fast food restaurants that required you to get out of your car. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that this is a big mistake.\n\nSecondly, the service is very hit and miss. One time I asked for the thin/skinny fries, and they put the larger steak fries in my bag anyway (which if you ask me, aren't as good.) One time they tried taking my order when they weren't even standing at the register, and needless to say I wound up repeating it several times. \n\nAnother thing that is really weird about this location is their jukebox. It brags about free music, yet the LCD appears to be covered up. On top of that, it even has money/credit card slots. Seriously? Having access to free music would be a great way to kill time while waiting for my order, but it looks to me like this damn thing doesn't even work.\n\nAnd another big flaw.... the PRICES. For a medium burger and a small  order of fries, its TEN DOLLARS. And this is WITHOUT A DRINK! The food at Fatburger is excellent, and I believe they would be justified in asking slightly more for their items.... but this is ridiculous.\n\nIf you MUST eat at a Fatburger, go to one with a drive-through - and be prepared to pay more than you might want to. This is a place that has the potential to be great, but this one needs a drive-thru, improved service, and lowered prices before I give them anything above 2/5."

Went in around 8 pm on a weeknight and there was only one staff member behind the counter, trying to fix a broken milkshake machine. Took about five minutes for other staff members to show up and even then they hung around the kitchen area. We had to wait for the first staff member to finish making milkshakes to help us and then he was incredibly unfriendly. On top of that there's no drive-thru.\n\nIf you're looking for a good burger in Vegas go to SmashBurger, or at the least In-N-Out. Avoid Fatburger."

Food was served fairly quick seeing as how the food is made to order and fresh. Burger was big and juicy (I ordered the XXL 1lb burger) the veggies were fresh. The only thing I suggest they do is get heartier buns that can hold up when topped with 16oz of juicy beef (half way thru the bun wasnt sloppy soaked but it was pretty weak) the beef had a great seasoning to it and the fries, which are my favorite kind steak fries (fat fries) were cooked perfectly. It was pretty empty in the building I dont see why but the joint was clean. Overall the service, food, and the fact it took me back 9years since high school when I used to eat fat burger every other week this place scores a solid 5"

I walked in the store and the pos system was down so they had to write my order down, I got the honey garlic crispy chicken and a side of onion rings the chicken was rubbery and I don't think it was cooked fully through because of the texture, way too much honey garlic sauce it made the chicken breading soggy or maybe that was because the meat wasn't cooked all they way either was it was a disgusting mess. The onion rings must have been cooked at a low temp in dirty oil because it was like an old nasty crunch and oily at the same time. I heard no sizzling coming from the fryers. I threw it all away and ate left over from the fridge. Thanks for a horrible experience. I used to love fat burger now I don't think I can ever eat there again. I'd give a half of a star if I could.

I get a large with cheddar cheese and bacon. there sweet potato fries are great as well and who can complain about Haagen-Dazs ice cream milk shake? not me.\nI am just sad that the last few times i have come in I have had to eat outside because the whole inside smells like a bad sewer. Im not just talking about, oh someone made a big stinky a while ago i mean my burger might have some sort of a poop smell. It was so bad the other day that I had to leave before I even ordered. I really hope they can fix this problem being that I love this place and it is the closest to my house. maybe a suggestion would be to have someone put some soap and water down some of the drain hatches weekly. That works at my business building. just a thought.. until then I will have to go to another location."

            "review": "First, I feel like I should defend Fatburger from those who complain about the price or the length of wait for the food.  Yes, a fatburger costs more than a Quarter Pounder or a Whopper, and yes it takes longer to get.  That's because (A) it's a thicker (fatter) burger with fresher ingredients, and (B) it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp waiting for you to come in and order it.  A fatburger is cooked to order, so they are fresh.  Quality is a positive thing, even if you have to pay for it, or wait for it.\n\nIn my high school days, when I had a little extra to spend, I used to go to Fatburger with a group of friends and get some chili-cheese fries covered with diced onions and a chocolate milk shake made with real ice cream.  We would hang out in the lobby, listening to that great old time rock 'n' roll and classic soul that they always play.  Those were good times.\n\nNow that I try to eat healthier, it's been a couple of years since I've had their chili cheese fries or milk shake, but I still go to Fatburger once in awhile just for their veggie burger.  Kudos to Fatburger for offering a healthy alternative to standard fast food fare.  (If only In-N-Out Burger would introduce a burger with a veggie patty).  Fatburger uses a substantial Boca patty in their veggie burgers, and it makes for a tasty, satisfying meal.  It's probably the only thing I'll ever order from Fatburger anymore, so it's a really smart way to keep people like me coming back."

Plus, seeing that breakfast is served all-day, I can see a breakfast fanatic (me) frequenting this place on more than one occasion.\n\nDon't come here expecting extravagance. You get your typical breakfast sandwich: a bun packed with a sausage patty, cheese, and a fried egg on the bottom. The fried egg was a nice touch, which gave it more a homemade taste that you don't get in most major fast food joints. It's not a gigantic sandwich, but it's a good enough size to get my fill. Although it doesn't specify in the menu, the sandwich comes with a side of tater tots too.. score!\n\nI'd skip out on ordering the OJ. Turns out, it's the bottled concentrated Tropicana stuff. Does not taste fresh squeezed, nor does it taste fresh. Reminds me of the sour OJ sipping sessions during depressing hospital visits. Definitely gonna roll with a coffee on the next visit.\n\nPrices more than reasonable for the breakfast menu. I got my sandwich, tater tots, and OJ all for under $5. I end up spending almost twice that much getting something off the regular menu.\n\nP.S. - Free Wi-Fi is offered here!"

She only heard what she wanted to hear and didn't want to admit wrong. Again all I was calling for was to have them simply fix and remake my burger. She was just wasting my time and breathe. \nClearly nothing was going to get handled over the phone.\nShe lacks good work ethics and has no understanding of customer service skills. \n\nI'm so annoyed. 10 min drive, 15 min wait, had to drive back and wait for her to refund my card.

The cashier was very nice, however don't be fooled, a nice face does not mean a sense of urgency. My order was punched in at 5:59, and since I know the burgers are make to order, I expected the food to be out in about ten minutes.\n\nWrong. The female cashier and the male cook had absolutely no teamwork whatsoever. They were all over the place and were literally falling apart, with only 4-5 orders on the screen. There was food just sitting under the heat lamp for a good ten minutes before she decided to grab it and hand it off. At the 20 minute mark, I was getting impatient, because an elderly woman got her order (two burgers) before me, and she ordered after me. I politely asked where my food was, and the cook said it was coming right up, and that if I had a complaint, it wasn't their fault because they were short handed. \n\nThat's a load of BS in my opinion. I manage a high volume restaurant and any competent staff can handle multiple orders, ESPECIALLY when the whole menu is essentially burgers and fries. Even with two people, with proper teamwork, sense of urgency, and a sense of priority, they should be able to handle a work load, especially since it is what they are trained to do. \n\n6:34 comes around and I finally get my food, along with one other woman that was waiting for her orders to come out, which had a long ticket time as well. The cashier went up to me and said if I came in next time and said they botched my food, I would get a replacement. I don't want a replacement. I want to go into a food establishment, and get my order within a reasonable time period. 30 minutes is not acceptable ticket time for two burgers that weren't even made properly. \n\nOther locations are good, just this one needs some serious improvement."

I thought I would treat myself this past weekend to this 1 million calorie side item since I've been doing so good on eating healthy. This location was in the area I was in so I thought why not drive on thru...or wait there is no drive thru? Awkward. I hate getting out of my car sometimes but I thought why not create a calorie deficit and walk from the parking lot to the door.. Kidding. I walked in and a god awful smell of maybe like an old mop and dirty water/the sewer system failed smell. Yikes. At this point I questioned whether or not I should even proceed with my order. I looked around and everything appeared clean so whatever ordered them good ole chili cheese fries with the steak fries as the fry choice. Total wait time was approximately 10 minutes which was fine because after all I did request that everything be made fresh! At this time it appeared only 2 employees were working, 1 who was full time just in the kitchen on the grill and the other who took orders and helped also in the kitchen. Everything overall was okay and my fries were BOMB I just need that smell, whatever it was to not like ever happen again! Thanks :-)"

            "review": "When it comes to FF burgers, everyone has their preferences.  With me, it comes down to mood, location, convenience, price, and service.  Mood usually dominates my decision.  However, my most recent visit to Fatburger wasn't due to mood. It was due to convenience and location. It was late night at the Red Rock Casino.  My choices were very limited, especially since I needed something with no carbs, a high protein count, and quick.  Fatburger was my only choice.  \n\nNow it came to decision on what burger was I going to order.  The XXXL is way to big and the Large seemed too small.  I ended up with the XXL.  Since I wasn't eating the bun during this visit, I knew I could handle all of the 16 oz's that the XXL has to offer.  Their burgers are known for their seasoning and a healthy spread of their pickled mustard.  Sometimes their burgers are a bit dry.  That's where the condiments and bun come to play.  Without them, you will really notice how dry their burgers really are.  \n\nWhat sets Fatburger from the rest is what I call their \"Breakaway Meat\".  The burgers at Fatburger are not compressed/packed patties causing them to break apart in your mouth.  I like it since it's different, the seasoning gets inside the meat better, and you feel the texture of a good burger in your mouth.  What would be perfect is their burger meat on top of rice.  Almost like a Loco Moco minus the egg and gravy. Bottom line, good burger that hit the spot for what I was looking for last night. \n\nThe service was as good as it gets.  My only issue, which is not Fatburger's fault, was that the food court was dirty.  Tons of trash and tables needed to be wiped down.  I ended up eating at their counter because of this.  \n\nI didn't have their fries, shakes, and even their bun on last night's visit.  I will be back to eat here the traditional way and update my review. \n\nTIP:\n-You get big portions of meat in your burger and you decide what size you want. S, M, L (8 oz) , XXL (16oz), and XXXL (24 oz)."

She offered a refund but at that point I just felt sick and wanted to get out of there to clean up.

For an \"order at the counter, sit in the food court\" fast food place, this place is extremely overpriced!!  Some meal combos are over 12 bucks (approaching gourmet burger prices at sit down places with MUCH more ambiance!).  Anyway, our tab ran almost 36 bucks for 3 turkey burgers, 2 fries, 1 shake and two sundaes for the girls.  Good thing we had the groupon to keep it more reasonable.  Of course, with what we got, this place was STILL overpriced after adding in the savings!  Turkey burgers were dry, tasteless and small.  Fries were very unremarkable, our vanilla shake was basically tasteless as well.  I don't know how these places charge as much as they do and still have people frequent them...  What a rip off!!  I will admit that the regular burgers did look pretty good but we were trying to go with somewhat healthier alternatives.  Anyway, if you are after burgers that don't run 40 bucks for a family of four, I think you are MUCH better off at In n Out or Smashburger!"

Fries were bland and unseasoned. I got the thousand island burger and there was barely any thousand island on it. Both of our burgers were dry and to top it off, something was wrong with the soda machine. The syrup in the Coke was running out so we gave it back and got an iced tea instead.

Having said that, we have been going out of our way, to try every Burger joint on the west-side. I have to say after trying: Farmer Boys(very good), Smash Burger(over rated), 5 Guys Burgers(worst burger, but insanely good Fries), Montana Meat Packing Co.(very good), In-N-Out(best service & wife's favorite), Red Robin(great, but pricey), Chilli's(so-so for the price), as well as the Real National Fast Foods: Burger King(best of the Nationals), Wendy's(love the Red Head in the commercials, burgers lack flavor), Carl's Jr(not bad, but also not great), McDonald's(a familiar friend, but never the first choice), Jack In The Box(hate the burgers, love everything else), & Sonic(way over-priced). We have not tried: Any Asian Burger joint, Gordon Ramsey's Burgr, Applebee's, Heart Attack Grill & White Castle.\n\nAfter everything is said & done, Fatburger is still my favorite all-around Burger joint. Keep this in mind, I love a thick, juicy burger cooked Medium Rare to Medium, any more than that & I consider the burger to be burnt. I also love Fat/Steak fries or Potato Wedges. Fatburger has everything I look for in a Burger Joint.\n\nThe bad things people say about Fatburger: They take forever to make your food- yeah, this is true, but everything is made to order & I get the Fattest Burger, with Fat Fries & this gives me the perfect time to have a pre-meal smoke. Service is bad- Not True. I have been to almost all of the West-Side Fatburgers & have always had better service than a McDonald's or Burger King. Fatburger is pricey- yeah, this one is true, but if you eat as much as I do, I normally spend just as much at McDonald's or Burger King...... I just need 1 FatBurger, instead of ordering 4 normal fast food sandwiches/burgers.\n\nThe Skinny on Fatburger: If you love your burger, thick & juicy burgers & the option of  steak fries, Fatburger is the best California Chain Burger Joint."

Fatburger is more expensive but they have more variety in their menu (yes, I know about animal style and protein style).\n\nThe key trick for Fatburger is to get a discount card.  They punch it for every burger you get and when it is full, you get a freebie.  However, you have to ask for their card because they don't volunteer it and they don't ask if you have one.\n\nSkinny fries are better than their steak fries.  Chili is pretty good with chili cheese fries a favorite side.  Onion rings are very good too.  The milkshakes are real old-fashioned shakes (similar but larger serving size to In-N-Out.)\n\nIf you eat very late, they are your best choice since they are 24 hours.  Sometimes you have to make some noise if they are in the back instead of manning the register, however.\n\nThey are made to order so you can get extra whatever.  The one thing I don't like versus In-N-Out in addition to being more expensive is that they use chopped onions.  You can get a fresh slice at In-N-Out and slices are better than chopped onions because there is less cell wall damage and water leakage.\n\nThis location is not as good as some of the other Fatburgers but a mediocre Fatburger is still better than the best McDonald's."

Unless you want to get taken for a fool.\n\nIts been a couple days since we went there and I am STILL pissed.  \n\nFood is great, a carb overload but very satisfying! \n\nCustomer service... cashier... manager...  THEY DONT GAVE A DAM what you want... only what they can up sale you!  I went here and ordered a large combo with fries and a coke... for about 12 bucks... What I ended up paying was almost 18 bucks.\n\nNo I didn't notice how much until after I sat down and actually looked at my receipt ... yes dumb on my part but I was a little distracted with my drinking...  Any who I go up to the cashier and tell him that what I was charged was NOT what I ordered... This was before meal was prepared so I was sure it wouldn't be hard to correct... the cashier looked me right in the face and said I know that is not what you ordered but its better!\n\nSo the cashier  calls the manager over and HE tells me that he would not give me a refund that I was be happy with what I ordered. I argued that I didn't want double patty, too much food, just give me my money back ill go else where and he would not budge. He kept saying the burgers are so good that I would be grateful with the extra large meal, shake  ( it was good but I didn't need to mix shake with BEER gross plus I didn't order it). Needless to say I didn't want to start a scene since the MANAGER was the one telling the cashiers to pretty much rob us blind and I was drinking.. \n\nI just wanted to throw my pennies at that man and tell him he needed change more then I did... NEVER GOING BACK... \n\nFood however was great :("

Man that egg makes the sandwich.  Pair it with a side of fries and wash all that grease down with a thick, ice cold milkshake."

Compared to In N Out, this is the joint you should go to if you're really really craving meat.  In N Out is nice if you want a burger, but don't want to keel over after eating it.  I love one of their ads - \"Beware of psychic burger joints.  You know, the ones who make your burgers before you order them.\"  Hee.  The milkshakes were bomb too, all thick and made with real ice cream.  Order Fat Fries (the fries here sooo much better than In N Out), or get the Chili Cheese Fries which come highly recommended."

My relatives go to this Texas Station Casino now and then and try to beat the gambling odds and Gods. But after gambling if they have money left, they get something to eat and replenish all those calories expended cussing out the machines.  On this trip, they bought me a large Fatburger.  Yum, I hadn't had a fat juicy, delicious, warm Fatburger in awhile.  What a treat.\n\nThere was a little more mayo than I like, and the lettuce and tomato along with the onions and relish made for messy eating.  But the best part was the seared, fresh juicy hamburger patty. The bun was fresh and didn't fall apart. Overall this burger can hold its own against any burger joint in this town."

He came back to the table and we chit chatted for a bit and I looked at the receipt and it said a cheese burger with everything but mustard. I told my friend and he went back up to catch them before they made the burger and right away before he opened his mouth she said \"We are already cooking the burgers so you can't change your order\", he said ok I was just wanting to tell you that the burger is suppose to be a cheeseburger with mustard only and it's wrong on the ticket. This server had the nerve to tell him that he was lying and didn't tell her that. \n\nWow I couldn't believe it when he told me. If it were me she wouldn't have said it again that is for sure. What in the world has happened to customer care and satisfaction? It was such a simple thing that all she had to say was I'm sorry for the mix up and it will be no problem. I really don't think she should be waiting on customers.\n\nRudeness is not tolerated by this customer and they have lost 2 good customers.\n\nPS: I have her name but I don't think I need to mention that as I'm sure anyone that frequents there knows who I am talking about."

They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right."

I know that Fatbuger is a bit more pricey, but I'm a fan.\n\nFebruary 2, 2011\n\nIntended on playing Bingo.  I arrived late and ended up eating Fatburger and gambling.  \n\nOrdered:\nSkinny Fries (Well-Done)\nFat Burger (no onions and relish)\n\nPROS:\n* convenient location located inside casino near movie theaters\n* clean eating area\n* they got my order right!  \n* Unsweetened Green Tea and Black Tea!\n*Chili fries and you can add an egg to your burger!\n\nCONS:\n* Wouldn't accept my BOGO coupon. Cashier didn't know how to enter it.\n\nTIPS:\n* Skinny fries taste incredible Well Done and extra Crispy !\n\nThis place would have gotten a 4 star if my coupon was accepted.  The only reason he didn't accept it was because he didn't know how to enter into the system.  I figured call a manager and off I go, but I guess that didn't cross his mind.  It's all good.  I still have the coupon and will use it next time I go to a Fatburger.  This is your typical Fast Food burger joint.  Just a bit more pricey.  Super Good though. I recommend you try Fatburger if you haven't already done so."

Fat Burger is just as good in AZ and Cali as it is in Nevada. I order the veggie burger meal, my daughter a medium burger meal and my boyfriend the large burger meal. It came out to $31, and it was worth every bite. To save money next time we'll share soda's and save about $2 per drink since it's bottomless. :). Also if you wanted to save on time, call in the order. Remember Hidden Valley Ranch packet isn't free BUT sometime if you wait till the end and smile while asking nicely, you just might get it for free. :)"

We were walking down the main strip of Las Vegas Blvd. My friend Steve wanted to eat at Denny's, I said Hell no. Let go somewhere it's happening. Well we came up to Fat Burgers, right off the main drag. It was not to busy. I was not to hungry, but I ordered anyway. \n\nHere what I ordered, a large chocolate shake with whip cream on top, which it was really good. My sister ordered to Fry's, which it tasted like Burger King Fry's. It was not to bad. She also ordered the strawberry shake. She liked it. I drank the rest of it. My friend Steve ordered the chili, he said it was ok. \n\nNow to the service. We were #62, 63,64,65,66 and 67 were all waited on before we got our food. I sat and watch and stared at this guy making our shake. He took his sweet Ass time. I never in my life seen a human being take so long to make 2 simple shakes. Our waiter was horrid. I think litteredly  think he was stone. I had to ask him where is our food? He said\"ah i don't know\". We finally got our food 45 minutes later. Remember this is a popular burger joint, the burgers and food are prepped. They suppose to cook the burgers quickly. \n\nBAD BAD BAD SERVICE for a renowned burger joint, we should have gone to DENNY's, at least we would have got better service. Hope to God the CEO of FAT BURGERS reads this YELP!"
