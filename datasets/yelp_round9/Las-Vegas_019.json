            "review": "Okay. I'll start off with this. I have been going to the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge since it was Patsy's. Over 25 years. I absolutely was thrilled to see this place at Boca Park since my wife and I just moved from the Big Apple in July of 2011. This review is based on a visit in Sept of that year. \n\nThe only thing this place had in common with the original Grimaldi's is the name. Sad. I don't remember much, but there was nothing special about it. I have I guess two categories for pizza. There's NY pizza and everything else. So I can eat a pizza and say this is one of the best I've had, or one of the best I've had outside of NY. My standard in pizza comes from places like Grimaldi's, Patsy's in Harlem, L&B Spumoni Gardens, DiFaras, etc... This place was nothing more than a chain pizzeria licensing the name. \nThe pie was bland, toppings terrible, no taste really. I will never go back. The waiter was really nice though."

            "review": "I got an itch to try Grimaldi's this weekend after hearing everybody rave about it and, i have to say, it came up short of my expectations. \n\nThe service could have been better. While we were greeted by a very friendly, helpful hostess, our waiter left much to be desired. It took 15 minutes of being seated before getting any service and the place wasn't crowded. \n\nAs far as the food goes, that fell short of my expectations as well. We ordered a large artichoke, sun-dried tomato and grilled chicken white pizza. I might be biased because I'm not a total fan of thin crust but it's not offensive to me but, when we received our order, the whole pizza was burnt. Definitely not worth what we paid for it. \n\nOverall, I'd probably give this place another try because I believe that sometimes you get an \"off\" experience and I think Grimaldi's definitely has potential. The patio is very nice for people watching and I think it's a good place to come for lunch, especially now that warmer temperatures are upon us."

            "review": "Price of a pizza was 12$ for a cheese, added mushrooms and Roni for 2$ more  each. For a sit down place like this, not a bad price. started off with a salad, hade red onion, roasted red, olives, tomatoes. Dressing was so-so, but the salad mix was good. Pizza came out, and the crust was a little burnt. but the pizza was great. they had it laid out with cheese, toppings and then sauce. so if you are a person that likes a lot of sauce, then this might not be your pizza. but as for me i like a perfect balance, then this is your pizza. cheese was awesome, toppings tasted fresh. great crunch when i bit into the pizza. 3 slices filled me up for lunch. It was very slow, during lunch, so i expected the staff would be very attentive."

The waiter sat us down, and it seemed like he didn't really wanna be there. Two of our girlfriends showed up first and they got their drinks. Then my friend and I sat down at the table. We easily sat there for about 10 minutes and no one ever came by and asked if we wanted anything to drink. At that moment we knew whenever we saw someone just to order. Our waiter just had a very bad attitude. Like I said we love the food but our service was horrendous. Somewhat ruined our night out"

            "review": "Grimaldi's is GREAT pizza! This is by far my favorite pizza hands down!! I love to fold it in half and go for it! However my family does prefer thin crust pizza. If you are a Chicago style pizza lover, this may not be the pizza for you. \nWe always get our pizza with pepperoni, garlic and onions and then ask for it  well done. We usually order one to eat there and one to take home, because it's just as good, if not better leftover the next day! \nThe outside patio seating is great for the kids and so is the pizza dough that they bring out for them to play with. \nWe have done many family birthdays here with quite a few people, and every time, even though they don't always have a lot of floor space for all of the people that we bring in, they are always accommodating. (The Eastern and Serene location has a separate room for larger parties, which is easier. ) \n\nDespite another review below,  your pizza does include cheese in the base price. They only charge for cheese if you are ordering extra cheese. Also, ricotta cheese is not the standard cheese that your pizza comes with, that is an extra topping that you can order. They use fresh mozzarella on their pizzas. So I think it's kind of funny that this reviewer felt their intelligence was being insulted about having to pay for cheese, when in fact they had it all wrong to begin with!"

The pizza here was not only not good, but it was an expensive not good!\nThe crust. Supposedly made with water from NY....Ok... ??? It was charred and burnt. So who cares?\nSauce? I'm not sure if there was any on there but if there was, it had No flavor at all. Cheese? What was there was cooked to complete dry papery bubbles. All I can tell you is that it was white.\nThe pepperoni? Thick and Dime sized??? That is NOT Italian! One basil leaf dried out to a crisp in the middle of the pizza... Why?\n I could throw a Pillsbury biscuit topped with ketchup and Kraft cheese in a fire pit and have it taste better than this stuff! \nOh... and this restaurant doesn't serve ranch dressing. Wow.\nPeople, this is just another chain restaurant with a gimmick. Get over being suckered. Go get a real pizza, have you been to Montesanos?... Or Villa on Sahara and Valley View? How bout Metro?...\nThe noise level and the super bright lighting alone should be all the deterrent you need to turn heel and scram from this place. Not to mention the parking! OMG!!!"

I would tweak it with a little more olive oil and more sauce but that would be a 6 star rating.  Maybe they would tweak it for me if I ask?\nThe service was very good and my daughter loved the cannoli.  I ate to much for dessert but next time I will save some room to try the cheese cake to see how New York it is.\n\nNice pictures of Brooklyn and the Rat Pack.  The lights would be better off as Chianti bottles."

A large pizza can easily get to $30 if you like a bunch of toppings.

The salads are large enough to share, the pizza crust is thin crust and perfect to be able to enjoy the rest of the pizza no matter what toppings you decide on.  We don't particularly enjoy getting so full on pizza dough itself when it's so thick!  We usually get the pepperoni and italian sausage with half ricotta (Love the taste and texture here) and fresh basil after it comes out of the oven.  For 2 of us, a small is actually perfect size because there is room for dessert.  Haven't tried all of them, but the desserts we have had were also yummy.  Our regular go to place for pizza.  Wish they had a location near Aliante! We've done takeout, but best if you can eat it right when it comes out of the oven fresh. The staff is constantly re-filling our drinks and courteous."

The pizzas are New York style so the crust is thin and crispy. We ordered a small(16\") with sausage, bacon, mushrooms, and black olives. They inadvertantly added onions as well and were so apologetic that they offered to bake the pizza we'd ordered while we ate the one they'd brought to the table. We were okay with the onions so we told them not to bother baking another one. Our waitress apologized to us about the onions several times as we ate and was very attentive to our needs. The pizza was very tasty, but I have to admit that I would prefer a slightly thicker crust. You couldn't really pick up the slices--they drooped down so far that the toppings fell off. So we had to use a knife anf fork. But all in all, we enjoyed the pizza and were impressed with the service."

Not only is the pizza TO DIE for.. but the customer service speaks volumes! From the second we walked in this whole staff was ON FIRE! The manager Marla came around and greeted every table there.. and was genuine! She went WAY above and beyond and treated us to a slice of cheesecake because a big group of young soccer boys came in and she appreciated us putting up with them being a little loud! Seriously.. how nice was that! Our waiter Keith was also awesome, and knows how to give you 5 star service!!! Highly recommend GRIMALDI'S PIZZA for anyone looking for a New York style pie! We will be regulars!!! CHEERS!"

They keep the menu simple, with pizza and salad. And that is all you need. The salads are spot-on and the pizza is magisterial. The service can be hit or miss, and there is nothing special about the decor, but the pizza alone is enough for the five-star rating. As an added bonus, they have a solid wine list that is very reasonable! (The Coppola Rosso is one of the best wine deals in any restaurant.)"

Loved the decor. It paid homage to New York in a romantic, classy and  \"lower the lights, it's getting dim\" way. \n\nA small Caesar salad goes a long way!!! Just a simple salad, nothing extrodinary.\n\nTHE PIZZA WAS DELISH. It's not a pizza joint where they have different types of pizza to choose from. Rather there's three types of sauces\n1) Cheese and garlic\n2) Tomato sauce\n3) Pesto\nYou can go halfies on these sauces on your pizza. \nThen you choose the toppings. The price for this ranged from 2-4 dollars.\n\nMy pizza: Half cheese/garlic and pesto with RICOTTA cheese, sausage and mushrooms. Now the ricotta was a a nice touch but I think they could have had a lighter hand loading it on. It was a bit too much.... but the pizza was still delicious. The edges were nice and crispy but the middle wasn't so much, I think it was because of the ricctta. I could still taste the garlic after we left. \n\nOoOooo I heard the cheese cake was good but I didn't have a chance to try it! :o/"

The crust was thing and crispy and tasty, the sauce was fairly good and the topping selection was great.  I had no cheese with sun dried tomato, kalamata olives and artichokes.  The downside was each topping costs 2-4 $ extra, which is quite a lot I think.  However, they did give you a good amount of topping which is important since I don't have cheese.  I would order it again\n\nService:  The service was good, the waitress was chatty, which was slightly annoying, but she was nice and had good intentions.  \n\nDownside:  The iced tea was tasty but $$$, I think it was like 4 or 5$ for one drink my oh my that's crazy pricey.

They advertise coal brick oven pizza and that's exactly what you get: delicious, thin crust pizza with very fresh toppings.  There are a several pizzas (combinations of toppings) on the menu you can chose from, but you can also create your own from a reasonable list of toppings and sauce types.\n\nThe staff is fantastic every time I've gone.  You're greeted warmly at the door, seated and quickly have the attention of one of the waitstaff.  I've also ordered pizza to go and don't mind the wait while it cooks.  You're invited to sit at the bar, located close to the front of the restaurant, where the bartenders have also always been awesome.  There are TVs over the bar, and I've always been offered a courtesy soft drink while I wait.  They bring the pizza to you, check to see that it's what you want, pay the bill and  you're on your way.\n\nMy only word of advise for those who take out:  because the pizza is thin crust, it cools very fast.  I only live a few miles from the restaurant but my pizzas usually need a little love in the oven by the time I get home.  That said, it's never hurt the flavor and I definitely wouldn't avoid Grimaldi's for take-out because of this.  Fantastic restaurant with fantastic food.  Enjoy!"

It was not my choice to go to Grimaldi's because after going to their Fashion Show location, I found their pizza to not be memorable. I never went back until this day when my coworkers wanted to go. I feel the same way, the pizza is ok and I have had better in Vegas. \n\nThe pizza is good. It is not bad, but not great. For a chain, I think the taste is just okay but better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc. The waitress forget my iced tea I ordered then charged me for it. When I brought it to her attention she said she would take it off the receipt, but no apology for forgetting. \n\nWhat I don't like is their prices and their add toppings per topping and pay per topping. I got a personal white pizza (enough for 1 meal if you are really hungry or 2 meals if you are not that hungry). It has 6 small/medium sized slices. The base price is $10 for a personal sized white pizza. Add artichoke hearts $4, add mushrooms $2, add spinach $2, add mushrooms $2. My pizza is now $20 for a personal size pizza! Hmm did my pizza have truffles on it for that price? I did not even get my sun dried tomatoes or extra garlic because it would cost more $$! I think this is a rip off. You are better off getting large pizzas and splitting them if your party can agree to the pizza type. They really should come up with some pizzas that have the toppings already on there. If you think you are being customized by allowing toppings to be placed on for additional charges, it does not work when it becomes highly overpriced. Well this is a big company and I highly doubt they will ever change their method of pricing per topping, so in that case I highly doubt I would be back (not by my choice). \n\nWe did get a free cheesecake for teacher appreciation week and I got strawberry. I was not impressed with the consistency of the cheesecake, it was soft (way too soft and yes there is such a thing). I like a firmer more dense cheesecake personally. The strawberries were kind of odd baked into the cheesecake, so they got weird mushy. \n\nI spent $32 for my personal size pizza, half a small salad I shared, water, and tip and tax. That seems like a lot for what I got."

And it was so yummy!\n\nWe popped in for lunch and were seated right away.  Our server came by and gave us the scoop on the different types of pizza and the ordering process.  We decided on what we wanted, which was our go to of pepperoni and mushrooms on the regular pizza.  We then sat and waited for our pizza to come out while smelling all of the pizzas around us.  We were salivating like rabid dogs just from the wonderful aromas drifting this way and that!  Nothing really smells better than fresh baked pizza in my book! Yummmm.\n\nSo when our beautiful pepperoni and mushroom pizza arrived, we attacked the pie like no one's business.  The first bite I took resulting in me seeing fireworks going off.  I totally had a party in my mouth.  All I can say about the flavor is AMAZING!  I was in love from the first bite.  By the time I had finished my lovely first slice, my hubby was on his 3rd piece.  I don't think he was taking time between bites to breathe or even chew.  He was in pizza ecstasy!\n\nWe are now Grimaldi's lovers!  It has been added to our list of regular pieces to visit.  They have an email club and if you plan on going, I would sign up for it.  They send decent coupons pretty regularly and even a free pizza for your birthday!  I had actually signed up for the email club before we went.  I love a good coupon! \n\nIf you haven't checked this place out, I highly recommend it.  I think you will be please!"

I wouldn't change a thing about the pizza.  My only complaint might be that the people that work at the bar, never seem to notice me waiting to pick up my order, as they continue to talk and mess around with each other.  I have never eaten there, so the servers might be better.  But, at the bar they make it seem like I'm bothering them to do their job.  Other than that small gripe, I love the pizza! I wish they delivered!  \n\nAnd a note to the people that mention weird cheese in their reviews, that's what fresh mozzarella is like. Maybe you have become used to the plastic fake cheese out of a bag from dominos."

Didn't think so. \n\nStopped by this Grimaldi's right around lunch time after my friends and I had tuckered ourselves out shopping for Christmas goodies around Boca Park. We were very hungry with visions of pizzas dancing in our heads as wen entered the rustic-looking establishment. It is not huge, nor is it small. The wooden tables and wooden decor all around make a nice, cozy feeling. I caught a glimpse of the lighting above, which are wine bottle hung from the ceiling - loved it!\n\nAs for the menu, it's straight up simple here so don't come looking for anything other than pizza, salad, or a calzone. There were no appetizers on the menu, to which I was slightly disappointed. This may be different at dinner, but I can't be sure.\n\nEverything here is pretty much build your own pizza, which I think is pretty cool. We started with the white garlic pizza (large), added grilled chicken, fresh Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and for a nice spicy kick - jalapenos. Often times I think fresh tomatoes on pizzas make them soggy and gross, but luckily this one did not.\n\nThe pizza came out relatively fast; it is a nice, crispy, thin pizza, with a bubbly, brown, crunchy crust. I am not a pizza-connoisseur so I am not sure what \"style\" this may be, but I enjoyed it. I think we got just the right amount of toppings, anymore and the poor pizza would not have withheld them.\n\nMy suggestions: come if you want PIZZA, straight up, nothing else. Build your own and experiment with toppings. BUT - do not go crazy, I'd say, 3 *maybe* 4 toppings at the most and make sure you're putting stuff on there that makes sense.\n\nOverall I was pleased, between the three of us we got an amazing pizza, plenty of toppings, and splitting the bill we each owed UNDER $10. Yes. That's a damn good deal. Of course, remember, there were three of us splitting a large, so prices may vary! I will definitely come back here to try some more styles and toppings."

You just want to sit in a real, honest to goodness pizza joint that's not accompanied by an animatronic mouse singing outdated Barbra Streisand tunes from the 1980's.\n\nBut in seriousness, the pizzas are excellent, with a full range of toppings and sides, and it's easy to get enough for two people.  The service during my visit was excellent.  The server was very conscientious, making sure that my beer was poured properly without a foamy head.  It was just little touches that made the dining experience pleasurable. \n\nPricing was decent.  You pay for each topping separately, so a more ambitious pizza would become more costly.  But three toppings was a sweet spot.  Service was very fast for a weekend lunch, but nothing felt or tasted rushed.\n\nI liked this place a lot in Dallas, so I am happy to see one here in town.  It's good pizza.  Very good pizza, and you get what you pay for.\n\nI will definitely be coming back here for further 'za creations."

I would have hoped for fresh oregano and basil on top along with the fresh mozzarella.  For $12, I was hoping for a better selection of olives.  The pizza was a price right but the crust was a little lacking.  Almost too thin and crunchy.  It was like pizza on a cracker.  I like the crust to resemble really crusty bread with a little chew.  The sauce was the winner with great fresh tomato flavor and the toppings were top notch.  The beer prices were also not bad."

The pizza was good, but exhausting to get to. The local Grimaldi's has the great food with none of annoyances.\n\nIf you insist on thick crust/Chicago style pizza or don't really care what people throw on your pizza then, seriously, what are you doing?  Do some frickin research.  But if you like thin crust pizza, with high quality ingredients, this is the place for you.  \n\nI suggest asking for extra cheese.  The mozzarella has always been the bomb and worth every penny.  All the ingredients are high quality and you will end up paying more for your pizza, but, imho, it is worth it."

The menu boasts a wonderful list of fresh ingredients for pizza toppings, all topped with fresh mozzarella.  \n\nThe simple rundown:\n- crispy, delicious crust (5 star crust)\n- salty, tasty fresh mozzarella\n- soft tasting, smooth tomato sauce (not remarkable, but tasty enough)\n- wonderful list of ingredients (including roasted garlic)\n- everything blends together well and the pizza's not overly greasy\n\nJust writing out that list, I want to head back there and order another pizza, but then I remember that I just wasn't wowed.  Somehow all of that goodness fails to rise up to greatness and you're left eating a pizza that you enjoy, but . . . well, just enjoy.\n\nAll of which earns Grimaldi's 4 stars (I mean, I am a fan).  But put the price tag on the pizza and it loses half a star.  Bottom line: they're just not living up to what they're charging."

Grimaldi's is not brick oven pizza. It is COAL BRICK OVEN PIZZA that is DELICIOUS. \n\n   This Grimaldi's looks similar to the majority of their restaurants that I have had the pleasure to dine in. Before we walked in the door, the hostess welcomed us. She seated us in the middle. To the back was the open kitchen where they made the coal brick oven pizza. To the right was a hall with the restrooms.  To the left was a bar. Throughout the restaurant were pictures of New York. Above was soft lighting which made for a relaxing supper.\n\n  I ordered a personal pizza ($9). When you dine with other people, the personal pizza is the way to go. It is thin crusted with a portion that will fill you up, and your company will not be thinking badly of you for taking one slice too many. If I had been more hungry I would of paid more for a mushroom topping. The bottomless cola had zero flatness issues. The dinner was supposed to come with house bread. They forgot about it, which is not the end of the world.\n\n  With Grimaldi's major growth, it is easy to return to a Grimaldi's. To me this is a good thing."

First thing that caught my eyes were the wine bottle chandeliers, propped without their base, cap traded in for a light-bulb. They absolutely complimented the 'old town' feel of the restaurant. \n\nWe went on to order a large caesar's salad (dressing on the side), and a pizza (that came with mozarella), basil and italian sausage. Crust was thin and crispy and meat was juicy. Salad wasn't out of this world, but scrumptious nonetheless (especially after our hike!) What sparkled things (and eventually raised the rating to a 4 from what I believe should've been a 3.5) was the limited $5 Thin Mint Cookie Cheesecake made with girl scout cookies! Oh boy were they fine! Four of us shared it if I'm not mistaken, that cake slice was gone in less than minutes!\n\nIf you're up for a free pizza too, ask for an application card, fill it out and wait for their email offer a week before your birthday!"

I am always very please with the pizza and have almost no complaints in that department, but service just never seems to be very good there...  I, lol, drink a lot of Ice Tea when we go out to eat, so that being said, all I ask is that my Ice be filled up when it gets low...  I think I consider myself to be a good tipper, and my expectations are pretty simple, keep my tea filled and check on us once in awhile...sounds easy enough?  Anyways we like eating here and will continue to do so for sometime to come, once service is better this would def be a 5 star review!!"

We arrived relatively early for dinner and seating was not an issue, compared to the tougher task of finding a parking space not too far from the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered an antipasto course, which I though was good, but not exceptional.  We also ordered 2 medium pizza, with each half having different combination of toppings for more variety.  I like the thin and crispy pizza crust that is served here, which is not greasy like those served at some other pizzerias.\n\nOverall the dining experience was A-OK!  The price of the bill was reasonable, especially for being in the more upscale Boca Park area of town.\n\nHowever, it is also one of the more memorable dining experience for us, since one of the ladies in our party was apparently hit on while we were waiting for our drinks and appetizers to arrived by a totally random but well dress man.  And of all the topics to use to start the conversation, it was about carpal tunnel surgery (because her arm is still in a sling).  This carried on for about 5 minutes, before we realized that he is one of the FOH managers of the restaurant.  Anyway, he came back several times to check up on us, and also to correct a mistake in our bill (we ordered 2 medium pizzas, but one of them was accidentally written as a large). \n\nI would recommend this place for a casual get together, especially before or after shopping at Boca Park."

A friend of mine in Phoenix said that she ate at a Grimaldi's and it was the first real East Coast pizza she's had in the 2 years she has been there, so we decided to check this places out. We realized that this is an offshoot of the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and in Hoboken that we had eaten at many times so I was pumped.\n  \nGrimaldi's did not disappoint at all and totally lived up to my high expectations. The three of us split a delicious antipasto platter with mozzarella, salami, olives, bread, and peppers. I would totally get it again. Then we split a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza and it was amazing. The toppings were fresh and delicious, the crust was perfect, and the seasoning was just right. They do put parmesan on the pizza, and thankfully we asked them not to since my dad hates it, and they were very accommodating. \n\nThe service was friendly, at just the right pace, and the atmosphere was great. I loved the patio seating as well. Without a doubt I will be back again."

Good service though, It was our first time and our server explained the menu to us thoroughly. \n\nPizza was really good. If your into real pizza, not from pizza hut or domino's then this is the place to go. You basically order the base of your pizza and add toppings. We had basil leaves, ricotta cheese, mozarella cheese, and sun dried tomatoes on our pizza and it was yummy. I loved how the pizza was thin and crispy and wasnt drenched in oil, made my guilt go away for eating pizza late at night. \n\nThis place is definitely on my list for pizza.:]"

Needless to say, coal-fired pizza is now our new favorite.\n\nInitially we drove from the strip out to S. Rampart to get away from the congestion.  To our dismay, they said they had to clean the ovens (before the dinner rush hour) and we walked out totally disappointed.  Not 30 seconds later, waiter Moe, comes running out and says they can hold off with cleaning after our pizza.  Nowhere else would I have ever experienced someone who really understood and cared enough to do that.  Anyone else would have shrugged their shoulders and said \"oh well\". \n\nWe ordered the roma tomato, fresh mozarella, and basil pizza.  Any other Margherita type pizzas are scarce with all their ingredients, but not this one.  I couldn't believe how it was made with the eater in mind.  A bite of everything in every bite.  No skimping on their end.  We also ordered the caprese salad for an appetizer and it was outstanding, in flavor, presentation and portion size.  The moz they import from NY is so fresh and tender.  \n\nWe will definitely be back on our next visit to LV. \n\nNow we go back to VA where I have to drive 45 minutes for our second favorite pizza, wood-fired grilled. \n\nThanks Grimaldi's on S Rampart and thanks Yelp reviewers of all the Grimaldi locations for leading us to a great find!\n\nNQ"

            "review": "I know I'm hard on pizzerias. I'm gonna preface my review by saying this; Grimaldi's is... different. I don't mean it's a bad place; it's actually a really good pizzeria. It's just coal fire pizza. That's not something I'm particularly accustomed to. It is however not a bad approach. I'll always be a diehard brick oven proponent. To a pizza maker/connoisseur, it's more drastic than a Pepsi vs. Coke argument. It's more like Charcoal vs. Gas grills, American vs Foreign cars, Macs vs. PCs, or Revolvers vs. Semi-Auto pistols. It's just a fundamentally different approach. But I can actually appreciate it for what it is. \n\nThe decor is nice and classy for a pizzeria. Like a more upscale old school NY pizza joint. The quality of ingredients are high. I order different things now and then. I really like the meatball and ricotta toppings. Being coal oven pizza, you still get a pretty crispy pie. Sometimes, the crust is too crispy though, even for me. And since this is all the nature of the beast with coal ovens, the toppings aren't always piping hot. But it all has a really good flavor to it. And the service is outstanding. If you sit at the bar you might have Audrey serving you. She's a good friend, and she's pretty awesome. Tell her I sent you, if she's there when you go. The manager is pretty cool too! I would definitely recommend giving this place a try, if you have any interest in pizza whatsoever. If you are diehard like me, and from back east... you may be more critical. Just look at it as something a little different and appreciate it for what it is. You might actually love it. I've put it in my pizza rotation, and I think that says a lot. Oh and by the way, they unfortunately don't deliver."

Maybe it was actually a B, but the experience of eating there for the very first time was unpleasant, & left a bad taste in my mouth, in turn ruining the actual taste of the pizza.\n\nWe walk in & get the feeling that people probably end up here when the wait time at The Cheesecake Factory is 30 mins. or so.\n\nServer was not very friendly, never refilled our drinks & seemed to lack training. Checked on our food, looked unhappy & said \"alright\" (no \"enjoy your meal\" or anything along those lines) when we didn't need anything. Not sure they require servers to have a \"pleasing personality\" here.. When we were done, somebody literally just saw us out -- no 4 word, 4 syllable \"Thank you, good night\", or anything like that. As if we went in there & spat on their pizza?\n\nThe one nice person in there was this guy that took us to our table & gave my 19+ mo. old son a piece of dough to play with. The 2nd star in this review is for him.\n\nThe pizza is only something to write home about if you're writing your family to tell them not to bother with Grimaldi's.\n\nGrimaldi's, please invest some $ in training your staff."

My husband and I love their pizza and don't eat pizza elsewhere, unless we really have to. The flavors are phenomenal. I do think, however, that the Eastern Avenue branch makes better pizza on a consistent basis than this one. On a couple of occasions, the crust here was overdone: it was hard, like a cracker. Plus, the service isn't as great as the other branch. We've had waiters forget things here. The pizza here is still better than elsewhere, but I think the Eastern Ave. branch is better."

I would have preferred the kalamata bc the sausage wasn't overly salty like a lot of places, so the black olive actually wasn't salty enough. \n\nStill overall a very tasty pizza. Very thin and crisp crust, generous with the toppings, and the sauce while thin was very flavorful and a little sweet.\n\nEven though the large is a thin crust, we still had two pieces leftover to take home.

The menu looked pretty small at first, but it just has everything you could possibly need/want here. We went with a large house salad: Romaine lettuce, red onions, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms, olives, and Vinaigrette dressing ($8), a large white w/ garlic pizza with meatballs and mushrooms ($22), and two Cannolis ($4.50 ea.). \n\nThe salad came out in a bowl that was just big enough to fit the portion of salad in it, so it looked like there wasn't much salad at first, but there was actually more than enough for all four of us. I guess I'm just so used to places putting salad in oversized bowls that I don't realize what the \"right\" amount looks like. We each had at least 2 servings each and there was still some leftover. The salad was very fresh and I really enjoyed the mushrooms and Vinaigrette dressing. It's not too often that I have salad with mushrooms in it. The pizza blew all of us away. The crust was very thin, but not dry or overcooked. There were also a lot of garlic bits on top, but it surprisingly didn't bother any of us. It also had a pretty good amount of mushrooms on top, which I loved.\n\nOur waitress was always checking up on us and refilling our drinks throughout our time here and she would even give her recommendations, tell us a little bit about the different menu items, and even joke around a little. It really added to our experience here.\n\nTip\n*Sign up for their birthday promo. You get a free large pizza!"

            "review": "It's really 4.5 stars, but I'll bump up a half for a couple of outstanding things.  Get to that later.  In the end, Grimaldi's is a legit pizzeria that does everything right.  Great atmosphere for a pizza joint, great service all-around (although it can sometimes be a bit slow), and the best made pizza I've yet found.  \n\nSo let me explain the \"best made\" part a bit.  I can't quite say Grimaldi's pizzas are the best TASTING pizza I've had, although it is among them.  By \"best made\", I am talking about the parts that made the whole.\n\n- Fresh toppings, including things like real basil leaves, real chopped garlic, etc.\n- Sauce that's not too much, not too little\n- (Outstanding #1) Real, white, sliced (not cut into little pieces) mozzarella cheese that eliminates much of the grease that you find at the typical NY pizza place (even in NYC)\n- (Outstanding #2) Perfectly made crust that is slightly crispy outside, perfectly chewy without being overly firm inside, and not too bready\n\nFrom ingredients and execution standpoint this really is a 5-star pizza.  The sum of all it's parts, however, may fall a bit shy of that since I can't bring myself to truly give it a full 5-star taste.  No matter, it's still close to it.  Plus, their Caprese salad is the bomb!  Fresh tomatoes and thick mozzarella chunks, bedded by giant, whole leaves of basil.  Nyam, nyam, nyam!  Where do they get those giant basil leaves??  And then top it all off with a glass of Peroni.\n\nIn my 4 visits to Grimaldi's I've never been disappointed.  The only thing left to try is their calzone which, by the taste of their pizza crust, should be outstanding.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  I typically see most pizza joints as ideal solo dining spots.  Grimaldi's may not exactly fit that bill, but they do have bar area where you can sit and nosh on your own.  I don't see why not."

            "review": "I finally got a chance to try the coveted Grimaldi's pizza  (on my birthday, of all days) for lunch. It's conveniently located near my favorite coffee shop so why not I said?\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is how neat it looks inside. Wine bottle chandeliers, and various accouterments adorning the walls. They have a rather odd business model. The base pizza includes dough and sauce. Yes that's right...cheese is a topping. Rather silly way to justify charging more money to your customers. I would have preferred to pay the same amount with the cheese built into the base price of the pizza-- at least I wouldn't have felt my intelligence was being insulted. Although I suppose it's possible that there might be some lactose intolerant customers who take advantage of this opportunity not to have cheese on their pizza...\n\nAnyway you'll also find that the price starts to rack up rather quickly as you begin adding toppings to your creation, which you'll simply have to do at a place like this. We chose mushrooms, meatballs, and pepperoni. The quality of the ingredients is apparent. The meatballs were juicy and flavorful and definitely not frozen crap that came out of a factory. The tomatoes of the sauce are allegedly organic and I did find the sauce to be full flavored. The mushrooms are also a tasty, chewy delight. The cheese takes some getting used to. Ricotta as a pizza cheese is definitely an unusual choice but I did enjoy the meal over all. The lack of grease is a plus. I also really liked the way you can watch them put it all together. The pepperoni had a kick to it and seemed to be something you might find at a nice Italian deli rather than a Pizza hut.\n\nThe originality of this place, combined with the quality of ingredients, will certainly merit a return from me, but it falls short of a five star experience."

But for once he said this pizza was comparable to a NY pizza, he loved that you could taste the freshness in the sauce and the cheese was also great. \n\nI completely agree with his assessment but feel that the sauce although very fresh was lacking in spice/flavor. In addition, there was very little of it on the pizza to the point I had to request additional. \n\nBut that was my only disappointment and wouldn't make it a deal breaker as it was very tasty, ya just gotta make sure to order extra sauce. \n\nSo we will definitely be back, especially since I saw they had a meatball pizza that looks so good and I can't wait to try it."

            "review": "After 5 hours of walking and shopping at the LV Premium Outlets, we worked up a big appetite. On the drive home it was decided that tacos and guacamole from Chipotle could be a quick & easy dinner, but as we passed by the newly opened (1 month ago?) Grimaldi's in Boca Park, we made a last-minute decision to give their pizza a spin.\n\nWe order a small house salad ($5) and it is large enough to feed 3-4 people, so the two of us have plenty of green to eat. The house vinaigrette is not very vinegary, but the tomatoes and mushrooms are fresh and the whole green olives are good quality. We order a large, traditional Grimaldi's pizza with onions, garlic and jalape\u00f1os ($15 + $2 per topping = $21). As we wait for our pizza, a quick survey of the pizzas on other customers' tables make me a little nervous that the coal-brick-oven at Grimaldi's is over-baking their crust. Every pizza I see in the restaurant has dark-brown/black burnt crust edges. (Thinking that it will take a really resilient dough recipe to withstand that level of scorching, I will be very impressed if their crust is actually chewy/crispy!)\n\nOur pizza shows up. The cheese looks great - it has that stark white color of good Buffalo mozzarella. Bonus fresh basil in the middle of the pizza! No visible grease puddles on or under pizza! Overall the topping quantity isn't terribly generous, but compared to Settebello's 'authentic' (i.e. totally skimpy) pizza topping distribution, I find no reason to complain. With the first bite of any thin crust pizza, I pray to the pizza gods that the crust will be perfectly 50% crispy and 50% chewy. Unfortunately, Grimaldi's crust is 80% crispy and 20% chewy, and by the time the pizza is half eaten (4 slices left) it stales and becomes 100% crispy, much like the crust texture of a Tombstone frozen pizza. How did this happen?!\n\nThe edge of the crust is unacceptably crunchy and flavorless (and burnt!) and the second half of the pizza left me wondering what went wrong with this pizza - how does a pizza crust take a total turn for the worse after only 10 minutes into a meal? We could have easily left 2 pieces for a togo box for next-day's lunch, but found ourselves in a better-eat-it-now-because-it-will-get-stale situation as the crust was already surprisingly stiff. I actually heard the crust *snap* all way down the middle when folding the last slice! \n\nMy favorite pizza experiences in North America have included a few special pies at Lou Malnati's (Chicago), Pizzeria Bianco (Phoenix), John's Pizzeria (NYC), Frank Pepe's (New Haven) and Pizzeria Rustica (Miami). In Vegas I have had good luck at Metro Pizza and at Rocco's NY Pizzeria, and the pear/gorgonzola/arugula/proscuitto pizza at the Sammy's location on Sahara is a consistently tasty choice. With respect to Grimaldi's, I could say \"maybe we got a bad pie\" but judging from the dozen other over-baked pizzas I saw on customers' tables, I think a baking-time or yeast adjustment could really help - the flavor is all there - the crust just needs a little chewy tweaking! Service is friendly and very attentive. Apparently, the cheesecake at Grimaldi's is homemade and as good as NYC Stage Deli's..."

We also ordered the dessert trio with the cannoli, tiramisu and New York cheesecake. The cannoli was delicious. I've never had tiramisu before, so nothing to compare it to, but it was good. The cheesecake wasn't what I expected; it was a lot lighter and fluffier than what I've normally had. It also came with a raspberry sauce, I believe, which I didn't care for.

This place looks nice inside, brick walls and has a very tall ceiling. We ordered the Caesar Salad and a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni and red peppers. \n\nTip: The \"small\" salad size is big enough for two people to have one serving of salad. We got the \"large\" size salad and it was enough for 4 people. The way the pizza works is they have a set price for the sizes (small, medium, large) and then each of your toppings cost extra. But the toppings can get pretty expensive. So essentially for a large I think it was $16. And that is just the crust and sauce. We then added sausage, pepperoni and red peppers and I think our pizza alone came out to $24. So you can see that if you start adding lots of toppings the pizza will get quite expensive. \n\nThe pizza was delicious. Pepperoni was so good and so was the sausage. Had a nice little spice to it. My only complaint (and this isn't the restaurant's fault) is that I like the crust to be a tad bit thicker so I can hold the pizza slice by the crust and have the slice stick straight out. This crust is very thin so if you hold it by the crust the entire slice bends down to the ground. \n\nOur server, Daniel was very good. He was working the bar as well as our tables."

It had the average 20 minute wait for a Saturday night, tables were packed, yet service was on top of things. We ordered a pepperoni mushroom pizza and the manager brings it out to us. He says \"how does this pizza look?\" We're sitting there kind of confused because it was on the extra crispy side and had a bunch of holes in it. He followed up by saying \"it doesn't look good and it's not up to our standards. We're giving this one to you for free and we're making another one for you right now. I just wanted to bring this out because I didn't want you to be hungry.\" GIVE THIS MAN A RAISE! That was the best thing I've ever heard!\n\nOur second pizza came out and it was a tad soggy and seemingly undercooked.

When I first moved here I ate at a new pizza joint every week in hopes of finding a good slice.\n\nI finally found a great slice made in Vegas and Ive eaten at three of their locations now and the pizza has never disappointed.\n\nThat being said I did find a big hunk of metal in my salad. I want to give them negative stars for that alone but I love their pizza so much I cant. \n\nWhat I can say is that the manager came over and told me the salads were on the house and helped me fill out their incident report. I was physically fine and just lucky I hadn't swallowed it as I was thinking it was an olive pit. \n\nWe were happy with that but 10 minutes later the owner came over to make sure I was OK and said the entire meal was on him and that we should have desert as well.\n\nJust to show you how much I love this pizza we couldn't take him up on the offer as we were all stuffed.\n\nOk so outside of the Salad the Pizza was coal fired perfection and the owner/staff made the entire experience top notch and you shouldn't be afraid to try them out.\n\nI know the price can freak you out but its worth every penny.\n\nA break down of our experience here would be:\n\nSalad 1 out of 5 (explanation already given)\n\nPizza 4 out of 5 (half order of onions turned into light onions on entire pizza)\n\nManagement 8 out of 5 (after my last experience like this I have to say all crisis like this should be handled so professionally.\n\nWait staff 4 out of 5 (we had empty drinks on our table a lot and Im sure that was because she was to nervous to come back to the table. She did a great job besides the empty drinks and we did tip her a good amount even though we were eating for free.\n\nI have to say give them a chance just be careful chewing the salad."

We ordered a small pizza and waited a long time for it. The waitress came out to let us know it was made incorrectly and that she would bring us bread while we are waiting for it to be remade. We never got the bread...but eventually got the pizza.\n\nThe pizza itself was solid. The small is perfect for 2 people to share without having leftovers. Crust was crisp with a bit of a char, and the toppings were very flavorful. I agree that it doesn't have the elaborate pizzas as CPK, but the crust is much better than CPK and they stick to the classics here. We paid about $30 for a small pizza with 3 toppings and 2 beers. Not bad at all."

But it's up there so it does deserve 4 stars, service was good and the atmosphere fits the style of the restaurant. The crust of the pizza is perfectly thin, and crunchy, love that. The pies came out in a reasonable fashion. The pizzas are priced pretty well, although I think they should have some signature pies. Definitely will be coming back. Always love a good pie.

After browsing the menu we selected a 1/2 Quatro Fromaggio and 1/2  Garden large 18\" pizza. At first I thought would this be enough to feed the entire fam. Boy was I wrong.  \n\nPizza came out quickly to the table.  First the crust was thin and crispy from the coal heated brick oven.  It was crisy, delicious and flavorful from the way they cook their pizzas. I prefer a bit more cheese on my pizzas but the toppings were distributed evenly for a consistent flavor throughout.  The entire family was completely satisfied with this pie. This is one of the better pizzas I've had in Vegas so far and I'm looking to try another one of their specialty pizzas. The prices on the BYO pizzas could get pretty expensive with $2 to $4 each add on ingredient. Ouch!\n\nGrimaldi's has a decent craft beer selection like Lagunitas, Dale's, and Green Flash.  Prices are reasonable, however they do not offer any happy hour specials.  On Tuesday they do offer 1/2 off glass and bottles of wine."

I have been making pizza at home for 30 years so I know what type of crust and toppings that I prefer.\n\n Things looked good when we entered the restaurant and I noticed slightly blackened crusts on the pizzas as I enjoy a crisp crust with light toppings. Normally I order a pizza Margarita (tomato and basil) as it gives me a good idea of the quality of the ingredients and the crust structure and flavor. In this case, I also ordered some of the red peppers as an additional topping. The pizza that was delivered to the table was quite a disappointment. Smothered in sliced tomatoes, the moisture of the tomatoes and the peppers made a very soggy crust I expect a thin crust to be slightly crisp not wet and and soft. I don't mind paying $24 for a pizza (basic pizza $16+$4 for peppers+$2 for tomatoes+$2 for basil) but it really needs to be exceptional. This one was not. By the way, I have never before been charged extra for basil on my pizza!\n\nThe Mediterranean salad was OK (large, $10) and service was prompt although my half empty water glass was never re-filled.\n\nMaybe this is a good place to sit on the outside patio for a drink or two but I think that  their main and only dish, pizza, is really not up to par especially for the price. I would prefer Sammy's or Metro any day."

This was not a big deal for me sometimes the dough bubbles when you bake it and things happen.  What we didn't expect was for him to be apologizing profusely for the hole and informing us that he had ordered another of the same pizza personal size (which is 12 inches) to make up for the hole\n\nThis was so unexpected and they were so nice to do this that obviously a nice tip was left and the customer service over what for me was really a non issue definitely earned them  5 stars today."

They do get busy on a friday or saturday night but usually dies down around 830-9pm. The ceaser salad is done in a fresh made ceaser dressing the house salad is very good along with the caprese salad or antipasto. We normally get sausage or ham. Im not from new york or chicago who claim they have the best pizza but compared to amore of chicago and the newyork pizzas they have around here grimaldis is far better. I believe they have new york roots either way great pizza spot good for family and friends. Desert is very sweet and normally just stay away from it."

Thin, crispy, not greasy, unprocessed cheese, fresh ingredients.\n*The patio area is lovely.\n*The passion fruit iced tea is top notch.\n*The meatball topping is very nice.\n*The cheesecake is delicious.\n*Portions are generous.\n\nThe negatives:\n*The antipasto didn't come with lettuce, so we got a house salad instead.  The house salad was large, but almost 90% lettuce.  Lame.\n*They don't serve ranch (I take this personally).  Not only do they not serve ranch, but when I asked for it while ordering the salad, our server didn't say anything about not having it.  I was pretty disappointed when the salad came with a big dish of \"vinaigrette\" on the side.  Vinaigrette = a monkey dish full of oil, with half a teaspoon of some murky purple crap at the bottom.  I couldn't mix the oil into the murky purple crap, or get the murky purple crap out past the oil.  It was disgusting.  If I had been told they didn't have ranch, I probably would have gotten a different salad, or none at all.  The only other dressing they had was Caesar, and I'm not a fan.  There are like 8 salads on the menu, what's with the crappy dressing selection?  :(\n*Pizza toppings are all sold separately from the pizza, and they cost $2-$5 each.  Adds up fast.\n*The crust stops tasting good as soon as the pizza cools down.\n*The sauce is a bit too sweet.\n*The service is a little weird.  The pizza came while I was working on the salad, and I told the server that I would use the same plate.  She then unceremoniously plopped a giant slice of pizza onto my plate (still half full of salad) while I was actively eating from it.  Wtf?\n\nI think I'll stick to Metro."

It's basically a stones throw from my place, and I had heard good things, so off I went.\n\nA couple ladies greeted me when I entered and directed me to the to-go area which is at the end of the bar. I decided to try a small pizza which is 16in, and added pepperoni, tomatoes, mushrooms and garlic. The small pizza is $14 which is just crust and cheese, and any additional toppings are $2-4 depending on what you get . My total for the pizza was $25! A bit on the pricey side. The cashier told me it would be about 20 minutes so I sat at the bar and grabbed a beer. I was disappointed they didn't have any beer specials, but I ordered a small blue moon for $5. \n\nSo 20 minutes goes by and the pizza comes out and it looks pretty good. I get home and dig in and it is just okay. I think I would have preferred it to be a little bit more well done, as my pizza was very flimsy and the toppings were a tad under cooked. Also there was hardly any cheese. I did like the crust which was thin, but not cracker thin and it had some chewiness which I enjoyed. I don't really get the hype here. It was good but nothing spectacular."

The atmosphere is calm and quite, no one is overly loud or obnoxious either. But if you can always sit inside too if the weather is unbearable. There's a bar area for watching the game (and my boyfriend was glued to it, as always)\n\nI've been here twice so far, and each time the service was great! They were attentive and watching to make sure our drinks were filled and to give my boyfriend and I updates on our foods. The second I came here the pizza I ordered took a little longer than my boyfriend's. They brought his out and mine took another 5-10 minutes longer. Normally I would've have been kinda peeved, but our server came by and apologized and even offered to reheat my boyfriend's pizza because he waited for mine to come! That's what I call quality service!\n\nThe pizza has super thin crust and I was skeptical at first but it really complimented the pizza. I got a personal pizza with sun dried tomatoes and roasted red bell peppers. I love that they use fresh mozzarella cheese! \n\nI love it when service is great and knows how to \"entertain\" so to speak.

It's tucked between the Summerlin renowned Kona Grill & Gordon Biersch in the Boca Park Shopping Center.  This spot has failed numerous times over the past 5 years.....I hope these people make it.\n\nAnyway, I sat at the bar and ordered a Blue Moon.  They don't serve Pizza by the slice here....so I had to go for a 12\" Personal Pizza.  Since I already had 3 slices from the other joint, I knew I had my work cut out for me despite the small size.  I decided on a Pepperoni & Jalapeno Pizza.....the bartender Aubrey or was it Audrie?....anyway, she said the Jalapenos kick your ass, so was I sure I wanted it......of course I do!\n\nThe restaurant has a cool & comfortable feel to it.  I'll have to bring the family back sometime soon.\n\nAfter a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It was much larger than I expected.  The thin crust was cooked nice and cripsy....well done, just how I like it.  However, there is a lot of sauce on this Pizza.....more than I normally like, -2 in my book.  \n\nThe flavor of the sauce overwhelms the Pizza, so it's hard to taste the other ingredients.  The Pepperoni is the tiny almost Slim Jim type and had good flavor to it....too bad it was drowned in sauce.  Aubrey/Audrie was right, the Jalapenos do pack a serious Punch.....I was sweating pretty good after a couple of slices, and no it wasn't from the 100 degree DRY Vegas heat....it was from the Jalapenos.....good thing Aubrey/Audrie kept my Blue Moon full.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and the Pizza.\n\nWill I return?  Yes, I will bring the family with me next time and try a different pie."

I could taste each of the four components of my pizza. The sausage was moist and not greasy with good seasoning. The cheese wasn't just plain mozzarella, it had some extra herbs or seasonings, it had a interesting mellow flavor with a little \"extra\". The sauce was wasn't acidic but still had a good taste of tomatoe. The crust was thin with a good chew, it had the perfect thickness.\n\nOn the other hand, it wasn't that filling. For being a large pizza, it was less filling than the Naples style pizza that I have tried, which tend to be meant for one person. \n\nI also got a canoli. The pastry part was fried too hard. The cream was on point, it was creamy without being overly sweet.\n\nI'll come here again, even though the price point to \"getting full\" ratio is a little off here.

Told hostess we needed a table for 3 outside headed out and noticed another group closely following then some confusion as they said they were waiting before us so host gave to them. Waited for party to leave so we could get next one. Waiter never came back to get their check lol they ended up annoyed and came in to pay. Fronts horribly managed.  Sat us at a 2 person table...? Not enough room. Had to ask to be moved.\nEverything seemed to be fine... at first. They were literally falling all over themselves to help us with drinks etc. Had 3 different servers tell us about the pizzas there and ask us for drink order. Was kind of comical. Pizza came and was good... Our neighboring table that backed up to the wall seemed to be having some sort of issue and the man there jumped up abruptly and then the woman he was eating with did the same. Thought they were fighting... that was until I noticed some visitors on their table. Yes ON their table. That's when we also saw them. It seems Boca park has a rather severe roach problem. We immediately stopped eating when we saw they were scattering less than a foot away from our table and not one or two mind you... Dozens of them were crawling in the bushes and along the wall. I could have and at one point was leaning on that wall. Thankfully they didn't crawl onto our table, our neighbors were't as lucky as one dashed right in there while they were eating. \nTold the waitress as we abruptly moved away from the wall. She said they knew... and it was a problem they were having.  The manager came out who was extremely nice and admitted it was a problem and they had to spray several times a week and was going to start spraying everyday. gag! He gave us a discount. It actually read \"roaches\" under the reason for the discount. I wish I were kidding...\nIf it's that bad outside what does the kitchen look like?\nHere's a tip... when you have a roach infestation don't sit diners right next to it. We took our pizza home but now we are wondering why we even paid for the meal. None of us want to eat it. lol Nasty as hell. Won't ever be back.\nPart 2...\nLooks like I'm getting some hate mail from .. employees? or overly ardent Grimaldi lovers? lol They must really love that pizza! Pathetic. Now you are just riling me. I was willing to let this go and never go back... but not now. This is a review site! We had a bad experience. I'm going to write about it!\nThere are roaches there ... outside yes, but the problem is extreme. I grew up here. I know there are roaches outside. This is pretty damn bad or else it wouldn't have been mentioned. No \"Gecko's on a patio\" but then again, that might help them solve their roach problem. I'm not trying to \"ruin the reputation of a restaruarnt,\" (and yes they spelled it wrong, that's a direct quote.) I do have the receipt... would you like me to post it showing the reason, \"roaches\" on the there? It was so bad they have a discount called \"roaches\" in their system. lol It's time they do something about it. When a problem is that severe you don't sit people there! Period. And if its that bad outside I wonder what the kitchen looks like...\nI'd be MORE than happy to learn that they've taken steps to correct this little black crawly issue and I would LOVE to post that its been fixed on here for all to see... yet no one has contacted me other than really angry pizza lovers. Crazy.\nMaybe we can just solve this and have the health department come out and take a look. If they don't think its a problem then hey no worries!\nCheers!"

            "review": "Now like most college students, pizza is something I eat on the regular. Maybe a slice from Metro Pizza, or a cheap $5.00 from Little Ceasars, but it's not often I go to a place wanting more than just your average slice. Grimaldi's Pizzeria is that place to get that more than average slice!\n\nWe decided to visit Grimaldi's after a brief business meeting that didn't run quite as brief as we had planned. We considered going to Monta (refer to my past review that great experience) but based on the size of the group we decided somewhere a little more open would be more suitable. A member of the group had mentioned that Grimaldi's was a great place for some pizza, and so we took a vote and Grimaldi's came out on top.\n\nOnce we arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. This place really gave off a classy vibe while still being comfortable and fun. The chandeliers weren't diamond and gold, they were empty wine bottles, talk about inventive! There were older pictures framed on the wall that really made you feel like this place had something authentic going on, which I suppose it did. They only design flaw that came to mind for the group was that there was only one restroom for both genders. Not really too much of an issue when it's not that busy, but I'd imagine an unhappy line of people during the high business hours.\n\nNow whats the first thing you look at after you sit down in a restaurant? Many people might say the table, and in that case you're probably right. But one of the first things you take a good look at is the menu. The menu I had in my night was at first a little confusing. At Grimaldi's they don't have a list of pre-built pizza, every pizza is built to order. There were three types of base pizza. The traditional pizza, a white with garlic pizza, and the pesto. Following that was a list of toppings including items like fresh cut tomatoes, meatballs, and even anchovies. Knowing their menu can be a bit daunting, the waitress was very quick to inform everyone at the table of how the ordering process went. Not only was this very helpful, it was quite entertaining as well. The staff was excellent and very knowledgeable about their menu. The waitress also helped us decide on how we would split the check before we ordered, which is great because at most places we're left at the end with 5 people who need to pay on card and no pre-arranged plan what-so-ever.\n\nBeing new to the place our side of the table decided to try something we don't usually see on a menu. We opted for a Large (18 in.) white and garlic pizza with Meatballs, Italian sausage, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. The wait for the food was a little long, but understandable considering the table had so far ordered 3 large completely custom pizzas. The pizza that arrived was amazing. The toppings tasted quite fresh and the flavor was fantastic. The crust was enjoyable and the cheese was stringy and delicious, just how I like it. The standard condiments were at the table, parmesan and the crushed red pepper, but they were also joined by a few others like garlic powder. Each pizza was cut into 8 pieces and since we had 6 people on our check we decided it was a good idea to order a second.\n\nThe second pizza we ordered was a large Pesto with grilled chicken, roasted sweet red peppers, and freshly sliced tomatoes. If you haven't eaten a pesto pizza before, maybe Grimaldi's should be where you are having dinner tonight, this pizza was amazing. It was full of flavor, the fresh pieces chicken complimented the flavorful pesto while the sweet red pepper really brought balance to the whole ensemble. The waitress had told us that people order combinations similar to this and we can see why, it did not disappoint in the least.\n\nGrimaldi's Pizzeria is a bit on the pricey side, the average large pizza you will build comes out to around $30.00 each, but when you break it down to each person it's not that bad. Grimaldi's over all was a great experience and definitely a good place to go if you're looking for more than the average slice of pizza and want to be daring with your choices."

We scored the last outside table. (OK, not outside, 'cause you're in a mall, but outside the restaurant. Got it?)

Although I lack experience with true NY style pizza, I must say that if this represents a small percentage of it, I'm down for some NY love.  \n\nGrimaldi's is all about the oven, the crust, and the fresh ingredients.  When I saw the 3.5 star rating two weeks ago I realized that I had to eat the pizza to find out for myself.  Mind you, all of us have different tastes when it comes to pizza, each person wanting a certain stretch to the dough or sweetness to the sauce.  I personally love sweeter sauce, but at Grimaldi's it's more tangy.  I personally love shredded cheese but here it's sliced fresh mozzarella.  I needed to try something different, so I went for the personal with basil.\n\nIt took ten minutes to complete my pizza, not long at all.  When I received the box I sort of freaked out at the size.  I'm used to the pizza hut sizes, where personal means that small round personal pan pizza.  Their version of personal reminds me of a medium, or something very close to that.  The crust is super thin, slightly crispy especially on the edges, and the ingredients are layered nicely on top.  It was interesting to see the sauce exposed between the slices of cheese, and crispy basil on top.  I hopped into my car, turned on the a/c, and peeled a slice from the box.\n\nWow.  This pizza is yummy.  I'm not going to go so far as to say something fabulous, amazing, or even orgasmic, but I love this pizza.  At the point it's slightly soggy from the sauce, but still holds up while you eat it.  It's one of those pizzas I recommend folding the sides in a bit while holding it to eat it properly.  My husband hates crust and he ate the whole pizza--crust and all.  I love the tangy fresh tomato sauce, the mozzarella that stretches beautifully when bitten in to, and I go for basil in the oven rather than after because it gets sweeter and has that crispy texture to it.  Yum.\n\nAfter the first time there I went back two days later for the same order.  Then two days after that.  Oh and then three days from that day, and then four days ago and the day before yesterday.  Yeah.  I like it that much. I always order the same thing--personal with basil--because I don't want to ruin the flavors of the other ingredients and the crust.  I love the taste of the dough on this pizza--slightly sweet, almost a hint of sourdough-ness, and you can taste the char a bit.  \n\nRemember, we all have different tastes, and many aren't in to this type of pizza.  For me, it's the only pizza I'll eat till I find another great NY pizza joint in town.  The other downfall of this place are the prices.  Many wouldn't pay $9 for a personal size and then pay $2-$5 dollars per additional topping.  The small is $13, for example, so many get turned off by the price.  Still, it's a great pizza joint that I've yet to eat in at because I love the idea of getting a pizza in a box.  It's just this weird thing I have with pizza.\n\nYou should try Grimaldi's if you haven't yet.  It's not your typical pizza delivery crap, but something ten times better.  I like it, and I hope that your taste in pizza matches this place, too."

Me and the little sis had the usually sausage and mushroom and it was really good.\n\nSeriously if your looking for a good pizza place with a good patio this is the place.  Plus after your meal you have a few places within walking distance to have a good time."

A friend also said she had tried their Henderson location and liked it - so we ended up trying this location. \n\nI did enjoy the pizza. Crust was great, thin and crispy just the way I like it. Was it worth the price though? I wouldn't say so. We added the sausage($2), mushrooms($2), & roasted red peppers($4) to the pizza. Pretty expensive for toppings in my opinion... especially the red peppers. I was surprised they cost more than the sausage. \n\nNow, I'm not sure if it was because we were siting outside, where it was a bit chilly - or if it was the pizza - but after about 4 or 5 minutes, the pizza was cold. And, I'm not a big fan of cold pizza.\n\nService wise, it was decent service. Our server was friendly, but maybe a little too friendly. She took it upon herself to look at my friends iPhone, where she saw she had received a text message, and then proceeded to 'pretend' to unlock it.

We ordered a half and half.  One of my favorite toppings was not available (pineapple ).  Toppings ordered on one side wound up on the other half.  Every single slice.  If there was a food allergy, one of us would have been in trouble.   The crust was partially burnt on the edges.  We've had better pizza at a different restaurant,  and considering this was the specialty the pizza was overall  disappointing.   The manager was apologetic about the sloppiness and offered to make an individual pizza so ingredients wouldn't \"hop around\", but by then we were ready to leave.  Quite simply,  if you can't handle half and half on one without it being a sloppy mess then don't offer that option.  The indifferent attitude of the pizza server added to the annoyance.  Again, if the ingredients \"hop around\" it's because the pizza is being thrown together and not given adequate  care during the preparation!   The manager did discount the bill for the unwanted portion."

So, a big thank you to them for a very nice treat!  The free pizza came with one topping, and I chose the basic pepperoni topping.  \n\nThe restaurant is located in Boca Park which is an upscale shopping area with  various stores and restaurants.  The lot filled up fast on a weekend with nice weather, so it may not always be easy to find a parking spot. This area is quite popular!  \n\nThere's a very pretty fountain in the front with outdoor patio seating which is great during nice weather.  The interior is somewhat dimly lit, but that's actually relaxing on hot Vegas days.  The decor is well designed  and there's tables along with  a few booths tucked here and there.  \n\nThe pizza is thin crust,  I tend to be more of a thick crust person, however, their thin crust was nicely executed, with just enough crunch but not tough or chewy.  I expected it to have a bit more oven/smokey/coal baked flavor, so that was a little disappointing, although not a huge drawback. The sauce was okay - every now and then, the sauce tasted somewhat like meat sauce that you'd put  on spaghetti rather than typical  pizza sauce, but nevertheless was good.  As some people have pointed out, the cheese has a habit of coming off with the bite rather than sticking to the crust.  Again, not a huge drawback, just a tad annoying.  Let's put it this way:  I've had better pizza and I've also had a lot worse, so Grimaldi's certainly provides a pizza that's worth checking out.\n\nI also ordered one of their in-house cannolli.  As seems to be the case with cannolli, most of it isn't very memorable, with a filling that didn't stand out with any particular flavor.  It contains mini chocolate chips which are tasty, and that's mainly what you taste with this cannolli.  I won't hold that against them, though, because as I say, most cannolli for some reason seems to be run of the mill.  My recommendation  would be to  try a different dessert,  such as  one of their seasonal cheesecakes or their tiramisu. \n\nThey also serve wine and beer, although I didn't try any of those offerings.\n\nService was outstanding, professional, friendly and helpful.  FIVE STAR on that!  \n\nI was very  happy to have had the opportunity to try this Grimaldi's and if/when I make the trek  here for a second try, I would be more adventurous with the pizza toppings, as per some of the suggestions of other posters.  Bottom line:  if you're looking for a visually pleasing, nicely upscale area to have a pizza located in Boca Park  with friends and family, this spot would certainly be one to consider and check out!"

It had ricotta, mozzarella cheese, sausage and meatballs. They only have thin pizza here since it is NY style. The crust was thin but crisp and held the toppings well. I did enjoy the meatball and sausage but I'm not much of a meat eater so, I did end up picking a lot of the toppings off (people in my party wanted the meat and I wanted cheese ahhhh compromise) and next time I would probably go for a personal pizza with just the cheeses. The pizza is cooked using a coal brick oven. Our total was $37 for the antipasto, pizza and 3 sodas. I didn't think that was bad at all! \n\nThey have a dining area outside.

            "review": "It was a while since I went to Grimaldi's Pizzeria so forgive me if this review is a bit late.  The O.G. Grimaldi's Pizzeria is located in NYC, and is legendary in those parts as being one of the best places to get a slice.  In fact, the one time I was in NYC and had plans to eat there, the line was out the door.  Needless to say we missed the boat on that one.  \n\nBut luckily, even though it's not location #1 there's a Grimaldi's here in good old Las Vegas.  NY pizza?  Made in coal burning brick oven?  There's nothing like it.  Definitely a step above your chains like the Hut, Dom's, or Papa's.\n\nNo offense against Chicago, but I love a slice of NY pie.  No deep dish here at Grimaldi's, just yummy thin crust!  Crisp, a nice burnt edge, clean and tasty.  I could eat an entire pie by myself if given the opportunity.\n\nGrimaldi's has a great menu, somewhat typical of what you would find in a pizza joint.  But simplified.  No chicken fingers or intricate pasta dishes here.  Just pizza, calzones, and salads on the main menu.  And I like it!  Simple is good, as long as you do it right.\n\nThe wifey and I shared a date night out and had a great meal.  We started with the Grimaldi's House salad - romaine lettuce, red onion, cherry tomatoes, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, green olives, and mixed with the house vinaigrette.  Good starter - fresh, light, and flavorful with a good kick from the vinaigrette.  \n\nFor our pizza, we went for a large Grimaldi's seasonal special - The Buffalo Chicken.  It was a pie topped with grilled chicken breast, Buffalo sauce, mozzarella cheese, and bleu chesse crumbles.  Cooked till the crust and top was a golden bubby brown this pizza was pretty scrumptious.  Cheesy and melty, with a spicy punch, and a healthy crunch.  Not bad for a non-traditional pizza.  Next time though I think I might stick with something more Italian, maybe a straight up cheese, or a Margheria with cheese, fresh tomato, and basil.  \n\nPizzas range from $12 - $16 for an entire pie, with toppings coming in at an additional cost each.  Specialty pies will cost in the $20 - $22 range since they come with a range of toppings included.  Calzones come in around the $10 - $18 range depending on what size you get.  Salads are a good deal coming in small or large sizes at prices from $9 - $11.  You can get away with a decent meal for around $40 after tax and tip.  OK for a date night.\n\nGrimaldi's even does pizzas to go, and they come in a fancy box!  So in case you don't want to stay, feel free to call in an order, pick up, and go.  Pizza Pizza!  Wait...wrong chain."

Order them with just a couple of ingredients, like mushrooms and cheese, with a glass of wine, and pretend you are in Rome or Sorrento.  That is how pizza should be.  Had to make my own at home on the grill until I found Grimaldis.  Lot of work saved."

My friend brought her 1 year old daughter to this place.  By the time we got to our table, they already had a high chair set up.  When they took our orders, they also where considerate about the little ones well being with giving her her own sealable cup AND to keep her busy they gave her her own dough in a pan to play with.  Seriously!  You can't get this anywhere.\nWhen our pizza arrived, the server served us pure slices into our plates, with all the condiments we wanted.  The desert selection was very good and tasty.  You can tell the cooks put alot of heart into their food.\nOverall great food, great environment, definitely stop by."

Grimaldi's is my favorite pizza in Las Vegas!\n\nI've lived here for nearly five years, and I've tried all of what are purportedly the best pizza joints in town. I realize that pizza is a very personal taste, but for mine - it's Grimaldi's. I've never had a bad pizza there. \n\nI tend to change up what  pizza I order. Recently, I had their special white pizza. I don't remember the exact name of it, though I do recall that it had arugula and prosciutto. OMG - it was DELICIOUS. I think any pizza you order at Grimaldi's would be wonderful, but this is my favorite so far.\n\nIf you like Caesar salad, theirs is way above the normal pizza restaurant quality. The small size is more than enough for two!\n\nService has always been good, the wine list is decent for a pizza place, and the food has never missed. If you haven't tried Grimaldi's, do yourself a favor and check them out. I don't think you'll regret it!! Not the cheapest place in town, but if it's quality you seek, Grimaldi's has it!"

            "review": "My wife and I were very excited when Grimaldi's Pizzeria opened their location in Boca Park. We have gone there several times since they opened and to say our experience has been a mixed bag is an understatement. Over time we have become dyed in the wool pizza snobs. We look for the best pizza where ever we travel and have learned a lot about what goes into a great pie. We especially like wood and coal fired oven pizzas so we knew Grimaldi's would be right up our alley.  I've had a few very good pies at Grimaldi's and I've had a couple of questionable experiences.\n\n  On our first couple of trips to Grimaldi's we ordered pepperoni pizza and wine. The pies were well made with a nice char on the crust as one would expect from a coal fired pizza. The service was quick and very friendly. We were definitely satisfied with our visits early on. On a subsequent visit things got a little funny. We hadn't tried a margherita style pizza at Grimaldi's so we decided that that would be the order of the day. Now mind you the Vegas location doesn't have margherita as choice on their menu, but it's a pretty simple traditional pie. It's just sauce, mozzarella and basil. Pretty straight forward, right? So I thought. Upon asking for a margherita pizza I was given an explanation about east coast margherita vs. west coast margherita and how each is made. His whole east coast/ west coast thing made me forget we were discussing pizza and had me believing the conversation had turned to hip-hop music. East coast/ west coast? Really??!! It was obvious that instead of telling me he didn't know what a margherita pizza our server wanted to b.s. me. At this point he suggested that we try both pies. Against my better judgment I went along with him. Needless to say, both pies were wrong. The most interesting of the two pies was the east coast pie which did have basil on it: about $40 worth! Since that experience I have made a trip to Brooklyn and went to the original Grimaldi's where they knew exactly what a Margherita pizza is. Must be some sort of disconnect between the mothership and franchises.\n\n  With all of that being said Grimaldi's does serve a good pie and is worth the trip. The serve is always good and the wine list has some nice choices as well. Just remember, if you want a margherita pizza write down the instructions on how it's made! East coast or west coast!!"

Never have tried this place but always wanted to.\n\nService was fast and friendly, they brought some play dough, literally pizza dough (eggless) for y daughter to play with. \n\nOne thing that annoyed me but its what lots of restaurants do is, stuck is in the kid section. It's not a real section, labeled but I know they do it on purpose. It's no coincidence that four different groups, including use we're sat on the left back side of the restaurant. Parents won't get bugged by other kids, I guess is the mentality. It ended up working out though seeing as the kids make eye contact and talk keeping one another entertained.\n\nPizza was good, a little too thin for my liking but I know that's the authentic by style. The pesto was rich, an they really laid it on. Delicious, especially once you paired it with sausage on top. My daughters picky and she loved it. Folding the pizza in half worked for her and kept the mess to a minimum. The personal 12 inch fed her and I and left two slices leftover and came to 12 bucks. Pretty good!"

            "review": "I had pretty high expectations coming to this location, and they were mostly upheld, but I wanted better.\nThe pizza was pretty solid, but the service was lacking a little bit.\nI showed up earlier than the rest of my party on Thursday for lunch so I sat at the bar and drank an ice cold glass of water after a morning round of golf. I heard a manager talking, saying he was \"giving this table of first-timers a comped order of canolis\" \nWhen we were seated we went outside, and it was beautiful out so that was great. The hostess offered \"iced tea, water, or maybe a Peroni\" She didn't ask us if it was our first time, offer to describe the menu and their prices or try to upsell anything like an appetizer or garlic bread or salads. We decided to split a large and the ladies in the group were gonna split a small pizza, and the small is still plenty to share. The girls also decided to split a small caesar salad. We ordered and everything went normal. The pizza took a little longer than I anticipated being a very thin crust and the very beginning of lunch hour, but came out nicely proportioned with plenty of meatballs and onions on one, and plenty of ricotta cheese and pepperonis on the other. The pepperoni was nice and spicy, and the meatballs are full of flavor and nice and large too.\nWhen it came time to ask if everything was going well, clear the plates, get us our checks and get the hell out of there is where the service lacked. Our server disappeared for a good 10-12 minutes when we were done eating and it took a long time to get the check and clear the credit card back to us to sign.  One of the other things that bugs me about Grimaldis is that each topping is at least $2-4 and the personal cheese pizza starts at $10 and the large at $18. If you get a large with 2 toppings you're already looking at $24+ just for a pizza. Add two drinks and a salad and you're looking at $45 with a tip for a lunch.\n\nAlso, what kinda place doesn't serve ranch? We asked for a side of ranch to dip the crust in when the pizza came and she said they don't even serve it at this restaurant. With salad on the menu how do you not serve ranch? This is America right? We love our ranch dressing.\nDisappointing 3 stars, I'll probably try it again, but probably not too soon since it's about 25 mins away from my house"

It was large enough for three or four.\n\nThe pizza we tried was a small white with garlic ($16) with two toppings (pepperoni and mushrooms, $2 each). The crust was excellent, with a decent amount of it charred, as can be expected from a brick oven place. Even with all the cheese and pepperoni that was on the pizza, the bottom of the crust held up well and wasn't soggy, providing a crisp and crackling texture with every bite.\n\nThe small pizza is more like a medium and is large enough for two to share. Their \"personal pizza\" is what others would consider a small.\n\nThe most annoying thing about this place is that toppings are the same price no matter what size of pizza you get. Obviously, you're going to get more pepperoni, for example, if you get a large pizza. But, if you get a personal pizza you get less but have to pay the same price. These pies aren't cheap, so when you start adding toppings the price can get ridiculous.\n\nI'm not sure I'll be back to this location, just because finding parking at Boca Park is always a hassle. But I will stop by another Grimaldi's spot to get my pizza fix."

We never made it to the bridge let alone across so this was a treat to see when I saw the sign for it in vegas. \n\nI was waiting for the right time, one of those days where you're bored at home, want to do something but don't want to go out. A stop into here to place a to-go order, a small white garlic sauce pizza with Italian sausage and roasted red peppers came to a price tag of 23.xx \n\nWhen I got back four people had at it, and everyone enjoyed the pizza.  Little pricey, the staff I interacted with were nice and helpful explaining that everything on the menu is chose your own toppings, they dont have pre-set, pre-defined 'specials'. For half the world who can't order except by combos and numbers I know this will be hard, but use your imagination -- have fun with it :)"

First the Romaine in the Caesar Salad was bitter, according to my wife and kids.  The pizza we ordered came out wrong after waiting 45 minutes.  The manager came over and offered to remake the pizza and a free desert for our inconvenience.  The first pizza was on them, so to help with my starvation I dug into the first piece with a huge disappointment.  My wife was already upset with me as I complained about the pizza being wrong in the first place, so for a moment I held back giving her my thoughts of that first bite.  I couldn't take it after the second bite and told her my thoughts.  She agreed.  I thought maybe the second pizza would be better. It wasn't.   Not only this but it took forever to get the bill and pay.  I will not be returning anytime soon, if at all."

Waiter was extremely cool, though we could've done without his encouraging the loud group next to us to be even louder.  \n\nOrdered a large pie with garlic and mushrooms.  As another reviewer pointed out, the first slice was the best; Grimaldi's really needs to invest in some kind of serving plate that does a better job (or any job) of keeping the pie warm.  Pizza was just what you want from a thin-crust style, however incredibly, and I mean INCREDIBLY under-seasoned.  Even with the visible garlic on it, we still needed to douse ours with extra garlic powder, cheese, oregano, red pepper flakes and whatever other seasoning we could find.  Only then was the seasoning adequate.  \n\nMy wife and I did finish the whole pie, but the last slices were sadly cold, and my wife pointed out as well that there were bare patches on the pie where there was nothing: no cheese, sauce or toppings.  That is a cardinal sin in our opinion.  \n\nHad cannoli for dessert, they were quite good."

We all ordered different pizzas, the Don, plain cheese/mushroom, a meat lovers and a veggie.  The sauce was less than average and two of us commented that we could get a Trader Joe's frozen pizza that would taste better.  We all said the same thing...we can scratch this place off the list for the future.  We are originally from New York, New Jersey, Las Vegas and Chicago.  We all agreed it isn't worth a second trip.

Kinda torn on the whole experience. \n\nI stopped in for lunch with a friend on a Monday afternoon and waited a few minutes for a host or hostess. The young man who sat me was extremely nice and chatted while he brought me a wine glass. \nWhen my friend got here she said she had been here a few times before and really liked the pizza. My server also the bartender named Daniel was very nice and explained the menu to me. We ordered 2 salads and a small pizza. A server brought out my salad first and when I asked where the other salad was she said its coming, I said I would wait and she asked if she should take it back till the other  salad was ready. I said No and waited for the other salad not very long but could not figure out why she did not bring both out. I had the Caesar and did not enjoy it. First it came in a bowl that reminded me of a cereal bowl and not very flavorful.. I even asked for more dressing and still seem blah. \nThe pizza which I had heard is awesome was not. First you order the size and crust style then the toppings which cost 2 to 3 dollars apiece. The crust which was thin which I like was chewy. \nOverall with 1 glass of wine, a half carfare of wine, pizza and 2 salads the bill was $60.00. I will say the service was above average and the manager a nice lady came by to check on us, made the service experience good."

It's one of my favorite deals.\n\nMenu has a couple of salads (I prefer the Mediterranean) and apps, and you build your own pizza- pick a size and a sauce, then add on your toppings. So far, I've only had the red sauce but I like that they have a pesto available. The large pizza is enormous and their suggestion that it feeds 3-4 people is accurate. Something about the crust and sauce just didn't do it for me- it's good but not great, something was missing and we added a lot of the garlic. While I'm a fan and will come back, the pricing keeps me from returning regularly- it's pretty steep and considering the $3-5 per topping fee, they were pretty light. \n\nHeads up, their pizza oven is unavailable at certain times- they have a \"stoking hour\" (4-6PM?) to reset the oven and pies are delayed, but there are drink and app discounts."

They started off with the Caesar Salad (small) which looked pretty large to me.  I'm not a big fan of ordering salads since they don't do anything for me....just some greens tossed with sauce. They decided on ordering the Pesto Pizza with Onions, Sun Dried Tomatoes and Mushrooms. I'm not a big fan of onions, so I was picking them out. The pizza itself was a bit dry, but I think it was the Pesto. I didn't think there was anything spectacular or magical about the pizza, but I willing to go back and try the WHITE pizza which I think is more my style. Service was a bit slow, but overall its an ok pizza joint."

We were greeted by Elliot when we walked in and asked us if we prefer the booth or high stool chairs. Booth pleeease! And I'm glad we did. I never knew how nice it is in the back of the restaurant. I always came in for dinner and sat in the front area or patio seating. Summer time is great with those booths in the back. Melissa introduced herself and asked if we would like to order any drinks. For two of us, she recommended the large Pellegrino, which was way too much for us. At the end of our meal, I burped and it stung my nose so bad, I had a tear fall down my cheek. Order the small bottle instead. Your nose will thank me later! \n\nWe ordered a small Grimaldi's House Salad, which looked more like a large portion! It felt like I drank a tall glass of fresh kool-aid. So refreshing! We ordered their large pizza with green peppers, artichoke hearts, and Italian sausage. My mom creation.. don't ask. Elliot came by with our pizza and asked us.. who would like the first slice. Then asked if we would like any Oregano, Parmesan Cheese, Garlic Powder, or Chili Peppers. We added all those to our slice of pizza and the first bite had so much flavor. I did notice that once the piping hot pizza cooled off.. the pizza, itself became stale. The chewy crust was hard as old french bread. Eat it while it's hot and you're good. Once it cools off, good luck! \n\nNow to the dessert. I love their Tiramisu here. I absolutely have to order this every time I dine here. It's made in-house and so is their Cheesecake. The mascarpone custard is creamy, light, and soft. The coffee and rum were so balanced that nothing overpowered one another. If you're in the mood for sweets, this is definitely a place for great Tiramisu!!! \n\nAt the end, Melissa, Elliott, and even the happy go manager lady thanked us for dining here and wished us to have a great day. A nice start to the first day of the week. Happy Monday ;)"

I think it would be 5 star-worthy excellent as something you eat directly out of the oven at the restaurant. I guess this type of pizza doesn't hold its taste in a carry out box for a long time. Don't get me wrong, it's good; but I'm guessing it'll be a lot better if you eat it at the restaurant. Maybe it's because the crust is so thin, it doesn't maintain the heat (and presumably its taste) as long as some of the thicker type of pizzas."

My wife and I split an antipasto, which was excellent and a large pizza with 3 toppings and it was $35.  For the two of us, we ate every last piece and were not exactly full.  The pizza is very thin, so honestly, a 16\" large is not that much for two.  If you have an appetite, you will need more than 1 pie."

Just park in the strip mall and head towards the fountain and you will find one of the greatest pizzerias in Summerlin (the other one is Rocco's by Costco).  I'm born & raised NY and my taste buds have been in training all my life, I know Great Pizza.\n\nThis thin crust is cracker crisp and will stay perfectly horizontal even without folding.  Here is what separates the Grimaldi style from others: \n1. They place fresh HANDMADE mozzarella slices (not shredded) on the crust FIRST\n2. Sauce is drizzled on top after the toppings (white pizza does not even have sauce)\n3. Oven temperature is HOTTER than hell which can soar up to 1200 degrees.  This coal oven brick pizza gives the crust that distinct charred flavor and crispiness.  Look under the crust and you will see the color that's different.  \n4. Pepperoni are little tiny salty slices which crisp up a bit.  SOOO GOOOD\n5. When you have been in the pizza business this long, you know that there are key factors that people connotate with excellent pizza: New York style, NY water, sauce, cheese, oven temperature, etc.  Grimaldi re-creates the NY style of water by re-creating the exact mineral content of Brooklyn water to make sure the dough is just like NY.\n\nThe coal brick oven is a goldmine and permit nightmare in NYC.  It wasn't possible to install a coal brick oven in Manhattan where Grimaldi originally wanted to open his pizzeria, so he opened up in Brooklyn (coal ovens had to be grandfathered in from the building).  Under the bridge on Old Fulton Street is famous, but now with the latest lease controversy, there is the new location around the corner from the original.  Back in 1904 Lombardi opened a brick oven pizza in SOHO and you can also wait in line to compare.  In March 2012, Juliana's will be opening up in NY as another Grimaldi spin off."

And the pizza came out really quickly.  I think we ordered, I went to wash my hands, sat back down, and BAM!  The pizza was there.  Or, at least, that's how I remember it.\n\nThe pizza hit the spot.  The crust was crisp and also soft.  The mozzarella came from balls as evidenced by the circular spots of cheese on the pizza.  And the sprigs of basil on the pizza added a pleasant note to the overall taste.\n\nGreat stop on my weekend trip to Vegas."

Really. The pizza was not as flavourful as what we expected. We had the marinara (tinned, pureed tomatoes) sauce with sausage, basil and onions. The lack of spice of the sauce and the sausage was  a total downer. The small amount of basil they did put on the pizza did nothing to detract from the overall blandness of the poor pie. Which was rather sad because the crust is one of the best we've tried.\n\nWe did go back to try Grimaldi's a second time - this time opting for a \"white\" sauce with meatball and onions. Still, the food was rather bland. Our server this time did bring us some dried oregano and garlic powder which we doused the poor slices with to give it some flavour.\n\nReally, for the food alone, it does probably deserve maybe a three star rating.

If I had taken one, hot bite and jumped on here to write a review, I would probably have given the pie a solid 4 stars, but that is not what happened. The pizza slowly became a hot, or rather cold, mess. \n\nThe place is cute with old wine bottle chandeliers. The bottoms are cut out, and the bulbs are contained within the bottle. They are clustered around the ceiling and are quite fascinating. It took a minute for our server to show up and greet us, and for some reason, on Saturday evening I was being a stickler for service, so that bothered me a bit. It is quite possible that the brightness of the wine bottle chandeliers made me hypersensitive. The bar area might be more comfortable.\n\nWe ordered a small salad and a large pizza with onion, garlic and jalapeno. Based on that scent profile, it is pretty obvious that I already have a man. The small salad was a huge and a good value at $5. The dressing wasn't a standout; it lacked that vinegary punch! Then the pie arrived. As I have been at other local pie joints, I was underwhelmed by the volume of toppings. I might start showing up with my own. Just start pulling baggies of onions and mushrooms at of my purse. Anyways, the first slice of the pizza was great. The sauce is a little sweet, and the crust was a tad crispy, but still with a good chew. No burnt edges, which meant I ate all of the crust. However, as the pizza started to get cold, the crust became stale. \n\nPerhaps it is yeast or oil deprivation. The pizza was the least greasy pizza I have had in quite some time, but I would trade in a stale pizza for a big ol' greasy pizza any day of the week. Maybe we went on a weak dough day, so I am up for a revisit, but for now it is a 3.44 star deal, which sadly requires rounding down."

It seemed like kind of a cheap free appetizer, but whatever it goes with pizza, its Italian.\n\nWe ordered Small white pizza with sausage and tomato (pretty damn good), inversion IPA ( which was bottled) and a house pinot grigio, which was ok.\n\nMy hubby was blown away by the pizza, I thought it was good, but not the best i ever had. Between the two of us, we finished it off with no leftovers. I definitely want to go again and try a more plain pizza, like red pizza with pepperoni. If my decision is the same after that, I will not return as this place is, in my opinion, too pricey for just two people to eat at."

            "review": "My favorite pizza in Vegas, if not, the whole entire world. I know that's a dangerous statement to make for a chain restaurant, but I don't care! My order is typically a large white pizza with garlic (already comes with pizza), pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage. Then we get oregano, garlic powder, and Parmesan cheese on the side... and then a side of Caesar salad dressing - great for crust dipping, but I end up throwing some on my pizza as well. I'll go back and forth between the Caprese and the Caesar salad, but I think the Caprese has really good mozzarella and the tomatoes they use are really hearty. I started to get embarrassed here when the hostess kept on remembering us and always said \"welcome back\", but it's really more of a nod to their great customer service here. As of late, we've just been heading straight to the bar to be served by Erin, who is one of the friendliest and thoughtful servers/bartenders you can ask for. She even remembers our order now too, right down to the drinks, but always checks with us first just in case we want to spice things up. Reliable and delicious pizza definitely keep me coming back and hasn't left me disappointed, so I'm really afraid to venture off to the other Grimaldi's locations. We always end up bringing 4-6 slices home with us, but they are great for leftovers the next day. To reheat, we put the pizza on a non-stick pan over medium heat, cover with foil, heat for a couple of minutes or until cheese is soft, and then we once again have hot and crispy pizza ready to go. There's a special going on right now, buy a $50 gift card, get $10 gift card for yourself, buy $100, get $20. Of course, I opted for the $100 and bought it basically for myself. I just went hear a few days ago and already can't wait to go back :D"

I would compare it to pizza like you would get at Sammy's.\n\nThe salads were were plain and bland, just like most pizza places serve their salads.\n\nAgain.

If I wasn't so full from Salad and wine, I could have attempted another slice put happy to know I have cold pizza the next day waiting for me.

The cheese is a little bit rubbery on the pizza, too; not to mention, this is probably one of the most expensive pizzerias out here. The staff also never really listened. I understand that it may be busy, but when you're shouting over your customers and can't even hear a simple drink order, that's when it kind of gets a little uncomfortable.

Only cheese comes.m every additional topping is an added fee. Most of the time I'm here with a few gal pals so the bill is so cheap for the three of us because we divide the bill three or four ways. The last visit the pizza was so dry. Needed more sauce and cheese. Had we added more it would have been a $30 pie. Which is too pricey in my opinion for some almost burnt pizza. All the other visits have been pretty decent so I will give the benefit of the doubt. The salads here are always fresh and tasty. My favorites are the Mediterranean and the Caesar. With plenty of pizza options in Vegas if we continue to get dry burnt pizza, Grimaldis will no longer be an option."

We ordered a large (18\") pizza with sausage, meatballs and roasted garlic. I though the pizza was excellent and had plenty of flavor and very filling. My cousin thought it could be crisper but just ask your waiter to cook it a little longer for that extra crunch or if you have to many toppings can make it soggy. Maybe the coal oven need to be seasoned more. The decor seems to be standard New York with black and white pictures of famous locals like the Brooklyn bridge Empire State bldg. etc...

It was a Tuesday night and the place was pretty crowded. We sat at a small table just off the bar and it was a little chilly since there is an open air area that services an outside patio. We ordered a lg pizza with meatballs. The pizza was excellent but i'm not sure I would order the meatballs again. Tiramisu was for dessert. It was also very good. Our server was outstanding. Pretty upbeat and talkative (in a good way) he was there to check on us quite often."

Bf wanted to try the spinach salad (I have a hard time not ordering the Caesar because it is my favorite), but the spinach was quite good. I appreciate that they never scrimp on the toppings. \n\nNow to the good stuff... Pizza. This pizza is my absolute favorite. I have to hold myself from eating the whole pie! This time we ordered spicy chicken, sun dried tomatoes & spinach and I don't know if I'll ever ordered another variation. It was perfection! \n\nI also love the Layer Cake Malbec and we couldn't leave without an order of cheesecake for takeout. So yummy! The service was great. Kimberly was very attentive & friendly. She got a little busy towards the end of our meal, but she communicated and made sure we had everything we needed. I'm so glad this place has been able to stay consistently delicious. Thanks Grimaldis, I can't wait for my next slice!"

The first pie was too saucy but still really good. So we ordered another pie which was too cheesy. \nBut what I liked about their pizzas was that the crust was thin and crunchy and the cheese was not shredded mozzarella cheese, it was buffalo mozzarella which made the pizza soooooo much better!!!!\n\nYummy Grimaldis...."

            "review": "NY style pizza that is absolutely delicious!! Usually I get a lot of toppings but here I just get pepperoni and it's amazing! The sauce is light and the cheese is the best I've ever had on a pizza. It's not super cheesy and it appears to be clumps of cheese before they bake it instead of covering the pizza with shredded cheese. I could be wrong but that's how it looks.\n\nThe only thing I wish they would change is adding a few more items to the menu like garlic bread or something. Sometimes when you're super hungry you want an appetizer other than a salad. I'm used to it now and I'm prepared to wait, so I guess that's a good thing since I'm extra hungry when the pizza comes.\n\nIf you sign up for their email newsletter you get coupons for dine in visits. My favorite email from them, is a free pizza during your birthday month! Happy Birthday to me lol!"

In this case, I think you do get what you pay for, so it's on our list when we want to go out and have pizza.\n\nI probably wouldn't take my kids here, though. It's not a restaurant that caters towards kids, the pizzas take a while to cook (as expected) and there isn't a lot of entertainment or ambience that is kid friendly. I'd rather save this for adults, I know having obnoxious kids around would certainly ruin the relaxing atmosphere for me."

            "review": "This is my absolute favourite pizza in Las Vegas, hands-down, despite the fact that it is a bit more expensive than I'd usually prefer for a pizza place.  \n\nCrispy thin crust, the sauce is flavourful but there's not too much of it -- no soggy pizza for me!  They have a wide array of toppings -- I usually go for ricotta which is to die for, fresh garlic, fresh sliced tomato and basil (the tomato and basil's best when it goes on after it's cooked).  Yes, their italian sausage, pepperoni, roasted peppers and sundried tomatoes are awesome but I like to keep it simple.  They've got a nice wine list -- whether you want something pricey or just the house red you'll be happy.  Also, if you're a fan of caesar salad, make sure you try theirs.  It's not dripping with dressing like you'll find at a lot of places!\n\nThe downsides... It's a small restaurant and can get very cramped so if you're coming with a big group, anyone with mobility issues or small children I would highly recommend not coming at peak dinner time.  Also, there is one waitress there who is just unpleasant.  All the rest of the staff are wonderful from the bartenders to the hostesses up to management... I don't know what her problem is but every single time I've been there she's made it clear that she does NOT want to be there.  But overall, all of the pluses make up for one bad apple in the bunch."

Grimaldi's is absolutely delicious!!\n\nFirst off - the crust.  It's that thin NY style, with a great char flavor - it combines crispy and chewy in just the right way.\n\nSecondly - the cheese/sauce - thin slices of buffalo mozzarella, with a delicious tangy/sweet red sauce makes for a combo that provides enough flavor that you really don't need any additional toppings - that being said...the toppings are delicious too!\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone in town!  One thing I would suggest is keep the additional toppings to a minimum - I never get more than two - because they start to take away from the amazing flavor the pizza already has.  My personal combos are Pepperoni/Mushroom and Kalamata Olive/Mushroom - yummmmm :)\n\nService has always been great - even during the busy times.\n\nEnjoy!  Seriously...go. Now.  Do it."

My full review will soon to follow!!!\n----That was just the tip^^---\n\nI was going to wait to review this place, but I can't. I'm so infuriated I could scream. We walked into Grimaldi's (Mind you, this was my very first time here) and while we were approaching the hostess, I saw her roll her eyes at my kids. LISTEN-- If you can't handle the service industry... BEAT IT! I worked every role in the restaurant business for years, including upper management. That's not how your greet guests. (Especially ones that Yelp!!)\nThe night was NOT starting off well at all. \n\nShe asks us \"how many?\" and said that there was a 25 minute wait. That was fine for us. We told her that we didn't mind eating outside if that helped. She QUICKLY replies \"There's NO room to sit outside\".... Really? I see two open tables and a large table of 6-8 people with to-go boxes on their laps. She obviously didn't want to take another table. \n\nNow I'm irritated. I hate liars. I hate mean people, and I hate LAZY employees!  \n\nWe got sat about 10 minutes later. Our waiter, \"AJ\" was nice, he took our app and drink orders. Not to my surprise he screws that up. We ordered red sangria, he brought white. It wasn't a big deal, but I was already annoyed from all the prior attitude. We really should have left, but the kids were hungry and it's a school night.\n\nWe quickly order two pizzas and crossed our fingers that our night was about to get better. \n\n... Little did we know that it would get worse...\n\nAJ, our waiter, came back a few minutes later with a red sangria in hand, apologizing for the confusion. (Ok, good work there)\n\n\nAfter that we sat there for another hour, watching all of the tables (that arrived after us) get served their pizza! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? An hour for pizza? The waiter kept saying  that it was coming. Our kids were hungry, getting antsy and I was really annoyed. \n\nThe manager came over and said our pizza was just about up. My husband told him what happened and how we have been sitting for an hour. What did the manager reply? He said we've only been there for 25 minutes!!! HOW DARE YOU?? I said \"Really? here's my Yelp and FB check-ins showing the timestamps\"...... He knew he was caught out there and said our pizzs was next and he'd try to help work out the bill. ----GEE Thanks. You basically call my husband and I liars, make your business look horrible, then just \"try' to make up for it? I told my husband I wanted to leave. We only stayed because we were curious what was going to happen next. \n\nAnother 5-7 minutes go by, and our pizza arrives. Just ONE of them lol. I explained to the waiter that I am a Brooklyn born Italian and NO freaking pizza is worth an hour wait. He didn't really have much of a reaction.\n\nOur second Pizza came another 2 minutes later. I take a bite... and to complete the WORST pizza story EVER.... IT WAS BURNT! Not crispy, not well done, outright pitch black burnt. It tasted like charcoal. We told the waiter we were done and over it and wanted to leave. \n\nHe brings over the bill, the manager took $33.50 off of the $95.00 bill. \n\nWe paid and left.\n\nNEVER EVER AGAIN! First and last time. \n\n(Burnt pizza picture was posted in my profile. YUCK)"

But the crust was chewy and overall this was a great dining experience. The wait staff was terrific and I have not one single complaint! YAY! Oh wait...I'm Italian, Sicilian actually and was raised by my Sicilian grandma who served every meal with BREAD! Where is the bread? Every table should be served with bread! I know it's high is carbs but it's also high in taste! \nMy previous, less fabulous review was for the location in Henderson, this one is for the newly opened south west location.\nBTW, they still can't touch Metro!\n\nOne more thing, this pizza is best when eaten at the restaurant. I ordered take out once and I do not reccomend it. You lose the crispiness of the crust and it turns a bit soggy. Also, its not good reheated. It is at it's all time best straight from the coal oven."

She remembered my name up until the moment we walked out (impressive). Typically, service is decent. However, after tonight, I feel compelled to write this review. Our waitress was Stephanie. She started out good, chatted with us about opening the bottle of wine, then when she was done, I asked her to bring us some silverware. She never did remember to bring the silverware. I had to get up and go to the hostess stand, after the salad arrived, to get my own. Then when the pizza came, she took my dirty plate but took a while to come back with the new plate. After finishing my first piece without a plate, we had to flag her down to get the plate (she forgot that too). At one point, she asked, \"did they ever offer you oregano or garlic\"? We were thinking, 'who are THEY, isn't she our server'? When we answered, \"no,\" she never did ask if we'd like some, then turned and walked away. She also never refilled the water.\n\nWe completed a comment card and took it to the hostess stand and asked that it be delivered to the manager. We saw our waitress run over to read it, along with the rest of the girls at the hostess stand.\n\nWill I go back again: Yes! I do love the food. I'm hoping; however, that service gets better.

We ordered the large pesto pizza with itallian sausage on one half of the pie. My friend had a water to drink and I tried the passion fruit iced tea. \n  Now the atmosphere is nice with the lighting a little on the darker side for a nice reaxing feel to it. Now I wasn't to keen on the drink I ordered so I just asked if I could switch it out with a Pepsi or Coke instead. That wasnt a problem. But while my friend and I were waiting for our pizza we were talking and trying to conversate. Unfortunately we were sat right next to the kitchen where they were making all the food, and as my friend was talking, I could barely hear her or make out was she was saying because of the banging noises and cooking that was going on right next to us. I'm sure any other table would have been fine, but because we were sitting adjacent to where the noise is, I was just annoyed a little bit about that. \n  When we did get our pizza though, it was definitely delectably delicious (LOL try saying that three times fast). It was a nice NY style thin crust pizza that me and my friend enjoyed very much. Is it the best pizza ever? Naw, not to me. The secret pizza place in the Cosmo is a better NY style pizza joint in vegas to me. But, I did enjoy Grimaldi's Pizza and I will definitely come back again. I had the Pesto so I'll try the White with garlic next time i come here. \n  The only other real minor complaint I had was that I never got a refill on my beverage. I left my glass at the end of the table so they could see that it was empty, and our waitress never noticed it until we were already done eating. And by that time, I didnt even want a refill anymore because that would be a waste of soda. I guess that's my biggest pet peeve when it comes to restaurants. You don't need to come by every 5 mins, but you should come by and check on the guests every so often to see if they need anything. Customer service is just as important, if not more important than the food the restaurant is serving."

Although, Grimaldi's isn't exactly in Vegas but it is worth the drive when visiting.\n\nThe biggest advantage to visiting the Vegas location versus Brooklyn is space.  This restaurant is much larger and therefore, no wait time.  The downside is slow service once seated.  You also do not have that 'authentic' down-home feel like the Grimaldi's in BK.  The ambiance is like any other pizza joint, nothing special and nothing unique.\n\nThere's nothing like the original but the white pie here was still pretty damn good.  Don't forget to add sun-dried tomatoes.  And if you have room left, try the cannoli. \n\nSome people like fast food for the 'cheap' deals so if you prefer to stick to the dollar menus or have Domino's just to save a few bucks then keep it moving.  Grimaldi's isn't your cheap or even average-priced pizza.  It is worth the extra $ so treat yourself sometime!\n\n4 STARS for this location\n5 STARS for the original location - must try but beware of the long line!"

But the service here is unparalleled, especially for a pizza joint. This time we had the immense pleasure of being helped by Joelle. She is definitely on it like Blue Bonnet. Patient in explaining the menu and pizza sauce variations etc. Also very efficient and fun loving too. I brought several family members here for my off to the airport meal, and we all had a blast with Joelle as our enabler. And this was on a random Monday lunch when you expect most restaurants to have their B team. I have a feeling they don't have a B team here. \n\nThanks again Grimaldis for another 5 star service experience."

The base pizzas are reasonable, but can be exorbitantly expensive with the addition of a few toppings. If you enjoy a basic pizza then Grimaldi's is fantastic choice. It is just difficult when they offer some amazing additional ingredients. The White Pizza with Garlic packs on the taste of garlic and that is always appreciated. Maybe not for the people I am with, but I am never too worried about them.\n\nWorking in the industry, I know that no server wants someone to come in and share a small pizza, but I was not hungry. I just came to keep my friend company and ended up snacking. Our waiter didn't seem too happy about this and focused more on other tables. It was fine, because he did refill my water once and that was enough to get me through the meal. Other than that, he was pleasant and prompt with getting what we needed.\n\nThe parking is always a mess in this complex. A Tuesday night and it was packed to capacity. There isn't any other parking options, so it will have to do."

I just moved to Las Vegas and asked where we should go to get some good pizza  He said he has heard of a place called Grimaldi's and that it has some very good reviews so we decided to go.\n\nWe go there around lunchtime and was greeted by a very pleasant staff. Since it was our first time there the manager of the place came out to greet us and recommended a few items on the menu.  We started off with a  Chicken Caesar  Salad which was amazing.  I don't like my Caesar to be too fishy, this one was perfect.  It was a nice fresh start to our meal.  Then we ordered a small calzone with meatballs and pepperoni which by the way is far from small.  It came with this marinara sauce that was so delightful that I wanted to take some home with me so I could dip everything in it.  It was cooked to perfection as was the pizza we ordered.  The pizza was a large with red sauce, pepperoni, sausage and basil.  Let me tell you, after eating there I can easily say Las Vegas' best pizza by a long shot.  The pizza was hand tossed with the freshest ingredients, topped perfectly and was also cooked to perfection.  I don't always judge a pizza by whats on it but by the way the dough is cooked as well.  I usually don't eat the crust but I couldn't help myself here, it was just so good.\n\nSo after all that food I had to try the desert.  I figured since everything else was so good the deserts must be the bomb, and they were.  I had the tiramisu and he had the canoli.  I didn't think I had anymore room left but when I tasted that tiramisu I couldn't stop until it was gone.  \n\nBetween the awesome staff, the great food and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant, I have to say it is the best pizza place I have ever been so far.  If another place wants to take the top spot in my book they are going to have to be something spectacular because this is an amazing place to eat.  I definitely will be bringing out of town guest, family and friends here whenever I get a chance."

We at first wanted to sit outside in the patio but there weren't any available tables at the moment. Rather than waiting, we just sat inside, a two-top table across from the bar.\n\nWe split a small pizza and both ordered some peach iced tea. Half the pizza was pepperoni with jalepenos, the other half with sliced meatballs, ricotta and mushrooms. It arrived nice and hot. I loved the thin crust, it was perfectly foldable. The ricotta cheese was very flavorful and complemented the meatballs quite well. I would say that the pepperoni side was just average though. The server came by once in awhile to check on us and filled up our drinks.\n\nWhat I liked best about this place was the noise level. Too often I go to a pizza place and I can hardly hear what anyone is saying. Here, we're sitting next to the bar (who had the TV on) and there were a steady stream of customers in the restaurant. Yet, we could still hear each other talk.\n\nMy dining companion wanted to get some dessert, their cheesecakes, after the pizza, however upon finishing the pizza the server came over and just plopped down the check. Did not even ask if we wanted dessert.\n\nOverall, I would say that this is a nice place for a lunch meeting or date. Don't expect anything too fancy."

The pizza had that great coal oven smokiness and just the right amount of char on it add that rustic pizza history piquant to it. The right amount of crispiness and chew to it that make eating a slice satisfying for texture foodies. The sauce was mild, not salty and a little flat in comparison to other artisan pizza places. The cheese was ooey, gooey and not greasy. Overall the pizza was real good and was made a tad bit better with some sprinkles of dried oregano and grated Parmesan cheese.

Unless the place offers personal pizzas, you have to negotiate toppings with whoever you are sharing with. And I am sure we all have that friend who thinks anchovies is a must have. On top of that, pizza restaurants are comparably overpriced compared to their take-out/delivery siblings.\n\nWith that in mind Grimaldi's serves up some pretty good pizza, but to me fails to impress. Their ingredients are for the most part better than their chain counter parts. The pizzas aren't greasy or heavy, in fact, they only seem to have thin crust pizzas (no deep dish for chi-town peeps). They are a bit overpriced for what you get, and considering that they don't offer any custom or specialties pizzas, I'm left wondering I just overpaid for a simple pepperoni pizza.\n\nI wish they had some more stand out ingredients or maybe a signature combo. I've been to this spot a few times and the service is pretty average. The patio is a nice touch but the restaurant itself is pretty small. Call ahead on the weekends as most pizza joints have a slower turn-over time and get packed on busier days."

Apparently 7:00 PM isn't really that late and the restaurant was packed. It only aboutb5 minutes before we got a seat though. They were quick on that. Unfortunately we were put into a small side room crammed around two small tables. Lucky for us we are a close family and didn't mind the close quarters. Ut got a little stuffy in there onve we all had a few drinks in us and hot pizzas in front of us.\n\nSpeaking of pizza and drinks, the food was the easy part. A Grimaldi house salad, a Mediterranean salad, a large The Don Pizza (pepperoni, sausage and meatballs) and a large with sausage and mushrooms. The drinks were a little more challenging. What beers do we want? Which wine do we want? Too many options you know.\n\nThe salads were fine. A nice variety of ingredients and a nice vinaigrette. We could have used a bit more of the dressing and my aunt actually did order some more on the side. Salad is just filler any how. It was the pizza we were there for. \n\nHalf of us ate the one with mushrooms and sausage and we all shared the Don. Both were really good but I think we all preferred the Don. The meatballs on it were great. A good size with a fresh flavor. Both pizzas were a little soggy in the middle. Being such a thin crust it cannot hold up to the sauce too well. The edges, however, were superb. Crispy and slighlty charred. Most all of us ate the crust and there were a few in the group who don't normally do so. What does that tell you?\n\nIn the end, everyone was pleased with the choice which made me happy because this family has a tendency to be hypercritical of restaurants. We all enjoyed ourselves, pigged out on some quality pie and teased the waiter a bit. He was cool with it. He was even laughing when trying to take the order of the group next to us. His quality customer service was noteable as was the service of the lady who brought our food. She cleared the table for the salad bowls and served up a couple slices of pizza to get us started. Good job all around."

It tastes close.  Water is shipped in from NYC to give the thin crust that New York flavor. The server was great. Ask for Bryna.\nThe restaurant is very clean.  We just ordered the pizza and salad.  Both were delicious.  I don't like cheesecake but my wife got some.  She said it was so good she wanted to visit Vegas again just to get this cheesecake. \n I would definitely come here again. It you're visiting Vegas it's nice because it's not right on the strip.  You get to experience a little bit of what the city is really like"

Also, they do share their parking space with Caf\u00e9 Rio and a dessert place. \n\nAmbiance (5/5):\nThis restaurant has the perfect ambiance of a NYC pizzeria. It's always busy and customers are always chatty. It's loud and during some game nights patrons at the bar area can get bit loud. But as I said before, it reminds me a lot best pizzerias in NYC. \n\nService (5/5)\nService is excellent at this Grimaldi's; from waiters to bartender, you are treated with a smile. They would also make proper suggestions on if you trying to venture into exotic toppings area. They keep their pizza in the oven if you running late to pick it up, which keeps the pizza hot and fresh until you get home. This is the best way to do a takeout.   \n\nFood (5/5)\nThis is the best pizzeria I've been to in Henderson or LV. I believe that this might be the best Grimaldi's location in NV. Every time I'm craving a pizza I come here to get my favorite custom pizza. I get their large pizza with marinara, pesto sauce (w/ olive oil), meatballs, and extra cheese. It usually lasts me for 2 days and tastes exactly same when you re-heat it the next day in an oven. Other item that I love to eat at this place is their caprese salad; it's fresh, flavourfull and light. Their cheese is not to chewy and it literally dissolved in your mouth. My mouth is watering just writing about it. \nTheir desserts are excellent as well, I would highly recommend blueberry cheesecake. \n\nOverall (5/5), I think that this is the best pizzeria for me until I've been to other famous places in LV for proper comparison. If you can look over minor parking issues then you will love this place."

Next door you'll find a frozen custard place imported from Utah.  You could also find some of the most popular burger places from NYC and Cali.  But what got me excited was the fact that at Grimaldi's, I could have New York's best pizza on the west coast!\n\nIn Vegas they actually have three locations.  I chose this location because of its proximity to my hotel and because of it's late hours (it closed at midnight on Saturday night).\n\nWhat I loved about Grimaldi's in New York was its amazing crust, is fresh tomato sauce, and its fresh ingredients.  It was just perfect.\n\nFor my visit to this Vegas location, I ordered a Margherita pizza with garlic and  a pesto pizza with chicken and tomato.  Both pizzas were winners.  I love the pizza dough - it's chewy and it has a nice sweet flavor.  The margherita is a personal favorite of mine - I just love the simple flavor and the perfect balance of the tomato sauce, cheese, and basil.\n\nMy only gripe is that the pizza was that I felt that the crust could have been cooked a little more.   I can't really tell you with certainty how this compares to NYC, but I can tell you with certainty that I was so glad to have some legit NY pizza on the west coast.  Definitely give Grimaldi's a shot if you're not able to go to Brooklyn.  There are two locations west of the strip and there's a 3rd location at the mall that's across the strip from the Wynn Hotel."

Near the end of the meal I was surprised by a manager (or possibly the owner?) coming over and asking how our meal was and really conversing with us. I said how great it was and how my girl raved about it to bring me here the first time - he said thats great and offered a free slice of cheesecake to each of us on the house!

About a year ago, we made the walk across the Bridge from Manhattan over to Brooklyn and found ourselves waiting in line at Grimaldi's. When we finally started eating, the pizza was properly seasoned, and the crust actually had that charred and burnt flavor that made the place so famous.\n\nWhen I heard that there were Grimaldi \"chains\" all over the place, I was immediately intrigued. The closest one was in Las Vegas. So on the next trip, we decided to check it out for lunch. It was about a 10 minute drive from the Strip, closer to Henderson. We found ourselves at some strip mall, which reminded me of Irvine.\n\nWhen we settled in and stopped looking at all the black & white \"faux\" Brooklyn framed photos all over the walls, we decided on sharing a large pizza, half with sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms, and the other half with pepperoni. We also shared an antipasto salad, which was pretty good. Fresh slices of mozzarella, salami, salted olives, along with some toasted bread. It was nice way to start off the meal.\n\nUnfortunately, the pizza was a bit of disappointment. Naturally, I had high expectations, having been to the Brooklyn location. The pizza overall tasted a bit bland, like it needed more seasoning in the crust. The crust didn't have that burnt-coal flavor either. But if you think about it, how could it? I was comparing it to the Brooklyn location, which the ovens have been burning since 1905. It makes a huge difference.\n\nI even asked our waitress if it was true that they ship in water from NY. She flat out said no, but they do have a water filtration system using \"osmosis\" which replicates the NY water. Interesting, to say the least. I wouldn't say it made much of a difference anyway. Overall, it's still good pizza that I would rather have than something from Costco or Dominos or Pizza Hut. Prices are pretty high, however, but good for the occasional splurge. 3.5 stars."

We got a tip from the local to get extra sauce, extra cheese, and fresh garlic. I'll tell you right now each of those items are 2$ a piece. Me and 3 other friends got a large which I think is an 18\" pizza, we all picked a topping and added the 3 mentioned above, one already being my friend's aloof choice, one added mushroom, another added pepporoni, and I added ricotta cheese (which I think helped make the pizza that good hehe). The pizza itself was 16$ I think, but add 12$ in added-ons, and there ya go 28$ but it was pretty damn good. I have to honestly say it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I've had my share of the mom and pop joints, hell I love em' but this place is just great.

I have issues at Settebello because the only size they serve is just a tad too big for me.... then I overeat because I can't leave the last piece on my plate etc...or then I waste some... I prefer to order a slighly larger pie at Grimaldi's and split it! Much more cost effective and no wasted pizza and overeating.\n*better drink menu\n*They spread the cheese out! No huge globs of cheese.. the yummy cheese is spread out perfectly.\n\nCons:\n*Crust is slightly better at Settebello's\n*Ummm salame... can't find that here! In general I think toppings are a little better over at Settebello, but not by much. \n\nHonestly we alternate between the two places depending on our mood. They are both awesome."

Caprese salad was good.  Very annoying that smokers are on the other side of the bar outside and their cigarette smoke is funneling into the dining area.  The bar keep sent them packing though, so thank you!"

The restaurant itself isn't so large, so you might have to wait to get seated depending on the time/day.\n\nI had several different types of pizza there, and the pizzas were always fresh and decently but I would definitely have expected something better, particularly given the price of the pizza/toppings.\n\nOne good thing about this place is the atmosphere which is pretty nice, with the restaurant's decor participating quite greatly to it.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that this place is average but you could still check it out if you're in the area and are craving pizza! Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"

Luckily there were a couple of open tables for us, since we didn't have a reservation, which I would recommend if you don't get there early because the line of people waiting for tables got longer and longer while we were there enjoying our meal. In fact when we left around 8pm, there was still a line.\n\nWe started with your standard pepperoni and sausage pizza, and then we ordered a specialty white pizza (I can't remember the name), which is supposed to taste like a cheese steak. I liked the pepperoni and sausage pizza better than the specialty one. Although it did taste pretty good, I think that there was way too much cheese on top and it made the pizza taste a little dry and marshmallow-y.\n\nAfter finishing two large pizzas, it still was not enough. So we ordered a pesto pizza with chicken and garlic. This pizza tasted really good and had tons of chicken on it and maybe just a little too much pesto. The pizzas here are thin crust, and it's a lot easier to fold each slice to eat it. I really liked that there was a bit of a crunch to the crust.\n\nSo our waitress was a little too anxious to clear our plates. I think this might be because they were so busy and probably wanted to try to clear the tables quicker so they could seat the people waiting for a table. She did check up on us often to make sure we had enough food and that everything was ok. \n\nNow here is where the 5 stars comes in. One of the guys in our group couldn't finish his slice of pizza, so he asked her to box it up for him. As we were about to leave, he asked her if she had the pizza. When she went back to the kitchen to get it, apparently someone had thrown it out instead of boxing it up for our friend. She informed the manager about what happened and the manager offered to either make a personal size pizza for our friend, or give us a complimentary slice of cheesecake.\n\nOf course we took the cheesecake and got the plain cheesecake with raspberry sauce and it was heavenly!"

Only problem he was the bartender and taking other orders while we waited , clearly they don't care about takeout if they have no one dedicated to handling it. They had plenty of people there to help but no one did.\n\nSo when I got home I got a cold pizza with very sparse toppings, not much mozzarella, sauce that was way to sweet and crust was lame and too much of it, not a good representation of a Northeast pizza.  Also I guess they figure people in Vegas wont notice it if they serve stale cannolis. What where they 4-5 days old? I will go back to Carmines from now on."

I feel a strong need to share the outstanding service we received from Stanley.\n\nI was seated before my friends arrived and didn't see a server for over five minutes. I had flashbacks to a few weeks ago and briefly considered sending a text to change our meeting place. A few minutes later, one of my friends arrived and I explained what I was thinking. As I was sharing my thoughts, Stanley arrived and introduced himself as our server.\n\nI explained to him my experience for two reasons: (1) I never did hear about my inquiry after the last visit, I wanted someone in the place to acknowledge it; and (2) I didn't want a repeat and ruined meal. He made a point of not just nodding and smiling, but listening, asking questions, and assuring us that we would not have to worry tonight.\n\nStanley was fantastic! Special orders were accomodated, wine service was excellent, and his care for us (and, in fact, the other tables around us) was perfect. There was some slow going with the food from the kitchen, but we weren't about to shoot the messenger; he was communicative and helpful and jovial, taking the time to enjoy our company and make sure that we had an enjoyable experience with him. He wasn't just a server, he was a participant in our little dinner party and it made all the difference.\n\nThe food and ambiance are still (just) A-OK, 3 stars. Stanley's 5-star service is what makes me inclined to give this place 4 stars for this visit. \n\nFYI to the winos: Bonus points for the wine list with a lot of  inexpensive yet drinkable wines - big fan! Bottles... yes, bottles, for $20? At a restaurant? Some are better than others, for sure, and they also carry a lot of variety all the way into the more expensive ranges... this was a nice discovery! \n\nPossibility of return? I can definitely see it happening if this type of service continues!"

A buddy of mine from back east (Philly) was visiting and I told him that there's a Grimaldi's off Eastern and 215 in Las Vegas. We visited the place last night around 5:30PM.\n\nWe ordered an 18\" light sauce pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms. We waited 15 minutes and the pie appeared. We were starving so we dug in. My bud says...\"so where's the extra chesse\"? and he was right. Not only was there NO extra cheese, there practically NO cheese on the pizza. I called over our waitress she brought over the order slip and sure enough she ordered extra cheese/light sauce. \n\nEnglish must be a second language for the oven/kitchen staff. Our waitress sent over the Manager and he apologized and said ....\"don't worry, I'll take care of this\" while holding the bill. We said great! We tipped our waitress and started to walk out when the Manager said...oh, wait guys, you still have to pay for half of the pie.\n\nWill somebody PLEASE tell this guy when you say....\"I'm gonna take care of this (bill)\" it means the whole bill ......not HALF.\n\nWe did get a $5 voucher for a future visit and so I will return and hope for a better outcome.\n\nJuly 3rd UPDATE!!! Visited the Grimaldi's on Rampart; tried to use the $5 voucher, and.......wait for it.......the voucher date expired three months ago. Yup, the manager gave us an expired voucher. All in all I'm gonna pass on any Grimaldi's Pizza in Las Vegas and wait until I get back to Brooklyn."

I've read and heard so many good things. \n\nFood quality - 1 star\nInside of my pizza box lay a black ring of burnt crust with a smattering of toppings tossed on top. The crust was burnt so much we could not eat it. I know a brick oven crust has some character and some char to the edges, but this was ridiculous. We paid $2 each for four different toppings. For $2 of onions, I counted 13 pieces of onions. $2 for a small handful of jalape\u00f1o STEMS. The mushrooms seemed like they came from a can. The sausage was the only tasty topping on our pizza. The cheese was as flavorless as the crust. Maybe if the cheese was burnt, it would have had some flavor. \n\nFood price - 1 star\nCompared to similar pizza places, excluding the fast food pizza places like Pizza Hut, the prices are a little high. If you only want a couple of toppings, your pizza will be cheap. If you like a lot of toppings, you should bring you last paycheck. My four topping, large pizza, complete with flavorless cheese and a burnt crust came two $25. \n\nOverall, not a great experience. I'm confident in saying I would rather have a slice of pizza from my school's cafeteria. Too much money and way too much disappointment."

And if that's not enough, the pizza is not greasy at all! \nIt is satiating without bloating you up and making you feel like you ate an anvil.\n\nAs for toppings I usually order their red peppers and maybe some extra cheese or sauce. I have tried adding chicken but the pizza ended up very moist. \n\nTheir Mediterranean salad is fresh and a decent serving.\n\nThe cheesecake is pretty good, not artificially and overly sweet like some others, sweet enough to taste like dessert while also tasting fresh.\n\nService has been very good and the staff has been very attentive.\nThere is some outdoor seating which is great, especially when it's windy.\nInside the decor makes you feel like you're in NY with pictures, street signs, rail signs etc.\n\nOverall one of the best pizza places in the valley and the best for oven baked pizza. I prefer Grimaldi's over Settebello for thin oven baked pizza; though quite similar in many respects, Grimaldi's gets my vote."

I wonder how well this pizza would taste 8 hours after ordering it because I remember the pizza being soggy when I ate it cold in NY. However this pizza held up. Definitely tasted better hot, but it actually held up pretty well eating it cold.\n\nWe also tried the Bailey cheesecake. It's an amazing dessert. Strongly recommend it if you have extra stomach space. It's still mostly cheesecake with a chocolate crust. It's lightly flavored with Bailey, awesome dessert."

Found out pretty quickly Grimaldi's isn't the best pizza place for young kids or parents with young kids. The place is kind of intimate (i.e., small). So when you sit, the back of your chair slams up against your neighbor's. So, because we had little kids, we spent the entire time sitting down, getting up, banging neighbors, apologizing - repeat till fed up.\n\nAsked for a kid menu - \"no.\" Asked if they had mac and cheese, or spaghetti with tomato sauce, or buttered pasta - \"no, only pizza.\" Asked if they had a vegetarian pizza, or a \"Hawaiian\" pizza, or a BBQ chicken pizza - \"uhhh, yeah, we don't have that.\" WTH?\n\nThe left side of their menu is pizza. The right side of their menu is salad. There is no other side. And they don't have combinations. They have ingredients and you pick what you want. And as each ingredient is around $3 bucks, if you want a \"vegetarian\", tack on  an extra $30!!! So, $46 for a large vegetarian pizza. Again, WTH?\n\nWe ordered a pizza with red sauce and extra cheese for the kids, and a pizza with red sauce, tomatoes and basil, and a pizza with white sauce, fresh garlic, and mushroom for the adults. The red sauce pizzas were kind of bleh - very little sauce and only spots of cheese. Literally. Spots. Of. Cheese. If you're looking for a pizza covered, smothered, and dripping with yummy melting cheese (and we ordered extra cheese, remember?), what we received was not it. Not even close. Picture this: a pizza with a small to medium amount of pepperoni. Now replace the pepperoni with cheese. That's the Grimaldi's \"extra cheese\" pizza! haha\n\nThe white sauce pizza, with mushrooms, on the other hand, was a different story. The white sauce itself was like an excellent alfredo sauce, with butter, and parmesan, and tons of garlic. And, unlike the red sauce, they actually put a decent amount of it on the pizza. The white sauce pizza was that pizza where you can't wait for one of your friends to try it just so they can tell you, \"yes, you're right, that's fricken' amazing.\" It was one of the best pizzas I'd ever tasted.\n\nIf we lived closer, my wife and I would go to Grimaldi's and, with a white sauce pizza with a couple beers, we'd be in heaven. Going in there with a party of 13, four of them little ones, and with it being a not-so-kid-friendly establishment, this was more like hell."

Fortunately, the acoustic gods were with us and we were not surrounded by screaming kids.  Great service from the start.  They had a ton of employees running around filling drinks and clearing plates.\n\nYou get a choice of sauces....red, pesto and garlic oil, and a ton of traditional toppings.  I had a feeling the meatball would would be killer and I was correct.  I really top quality thin crust NY pie.  Great flavor, texture and a good bite to the crust.  Ready to get your mind blown?  They use slices of cheese instead of shredded....and they put the sauce on top of the toppings...  Boom!  OK...not too revolutionary but the results were good.\n\nA very respectable dinner salad and a decent value.  Top notch for a pizza joint."

Each topping is an additional charge so this may not be the best place for someone that likes many toppings. I like the red sauce because it has a unique flavor that doesn't overpower the toppings. The standard amount of cheese is minimal which I like, but for someone that wants a really cheesy pizza you may want to choose extra cheese. \n\nIn addition to good pizza they also have some tasty salads like the spinach salad. The small is definitely enough for two people to share if you are also getting a pizza."

We thought, hey a pizza place to check out.  I cannot tell you how delicious the pizza tastes.  We usually order a Mediterranean salad and a small pizza with meatballs and mushrooms. Yes small because the pies are huge.  This pizza place has several locations over the united states.  They charcoal bake the pies to perfection.  The ingredients are fresh, and I mean fresh! The mozzarella is to die for. We have been to other pizza places and we always seem to compare them to this place.  You get a lot of people that say no way the pizza is better at blah blah city, but we are in Las Vegas not New York!  So what are you waiting for try this place out and if you are disappointed, then either something is seriously wrong with you or you have no pulse. \nI almost forgot, get the cheese cake or the tiramisu they are awesome! \nCheers!"

Lots of selection if you don't happen to be in the mood for a triangular piece of heaven. \n\nI've been here a few times now and have never had a bad experience. The slightly crunchy thin crust pizza is cooked perfectly each time; it's great but not super filling or overwhelming like some pizza can be. From peppers to pineapple they have any topping you desire. They use fresh mozzarella on the pizza so it's not oozing with a thick layer of cheese (a positive in my book), rather there are spots of cheese all around the pizza. The salads are enormous and wonderful. My favorite is the Caprese. You'll definitely want to share one of those bad boys. \n\nThe outdoor seating is awesome when the weather is right and the indoor seating feels like an Italian grandmother's kitchen, dough flying through the air and pizza ovens hard at work. There's also a little bar with TV's you can plant yourself at as well. The staff is very nice and attentive. A great outing for lunch or dinner!"

            "review": "Okay, let's just get this out of the way right now - Grimaldi's is not New York style pizza. I know, Brooklyn Bridge, brick oven, yadda yadda.\n\nBut the style of pizza that they cook here is much closer in spirit to the artisan/VPN style pies than to the floppy, foldable slices that to me characterize New York pizza.\n\nUntil I discovered Settebello (and honestly, not until my second Settebello visit), I thought this was the best pizza that the Las Vegas valley had to offer.\n\nWhy? Ingredient quality.\n\nOne reason that Grimaldi's maintains as much share of my pizza eating as it does, in the face of Settebello's competition, is the fact that Settebello does not serve pepperoni, while the pepperoni you will find on a Grimaldi's pizza may well be the best damn pepperoni on earth. It's organic, and while I've never really a drinker of the organic Kool-Aid, when you taste this pepperoni, you'll wonder what the hell you've been eating all your life.\n\nThe sauce is basic, clean of flavor and just the right consistency. The crust is the best part of a Grimaldi's pizza, with that charcoal essence bringing out the flavor of the other ingredients, including fresh buffalo mozzarella that practically melts in your mouth.\n\nOh, and one last thing. The garlic powder that they offer as a seasoning isn't the granulated garlic that you typically find on grocery store shelves, it is a much finer grind, almost a real powder that actually seems to soak up the grease on top of a slice. I would love to know where I can get a bottle of this super-fine grind garlic. Anybody?"

Me being me, i was scared to vier away and try something new and give up what is always sure to be a wonderful pizza experience! \n\nSo how did i try Grimaldi's?? Well, i was in a wedding on Friday and was busy all day from 9am-till after the reception ending at about 11:00pm, leaving the husband to fend for himself for the day!\n\nI get a call about 4:00pm, \"honey, I have a surprise for you! Can i tell you what it is? Can i please???\" My reply \"No love, that would make it not be a surprise anymore, now i have something to look forward to...  I will get it when i see you!\" and due to the fact that i at this point have large hair, too much make-up on and am in a freezing cold reception room trying to get all the name cards placed on the tables and get the bride ready and keep her happy, while keeping the kids outta the way and clean in their flower girl dresses i am excited to have a surprise waiting for me when all is said and done!!!\n\nDriving home after a beautiful wedding, the husband says... \"are you excited for your surprise? Can i give you a hint??\"\n\n\"Yes dear, i am VERY excited for my surprise, lay it on me!\" \n\n\"Remember what we wanted to try, but didnt want to give something else up for?\"\n\nI came home to half a pizza from Grimaldi's!!!!!!! :)\n\nAAAaaahhhh, how cute!!\n\nOk, back to the review.. while it was cold and not pipping hot and fresh i few minutes of heating up, it was wonderful!!! Now, I cant wait to go get one and try it fresh, its WAY closer to the house than Settebello's is and now I am willing to give it a try and vier away at least once!\n\nSo for now 4 stars, and if this location is closer or better for you than Settebello's is (at least for now till they move next to Whole Food's in The District) it is a fair trade off, or even if you want to go crazy and mix it up a bit!!!\n\nNow can i get a.... WWHHOOOAAAA PIZZA!!!!!!! :)"

            "review": "Reading other reviews on here is laughable.  PEOPLE IT\"S THIN CRUST PIZZA.  If you don't like thin crust then stay away from this place.  It's also COAL FIRED OVEN.  If you don't understand this,, the coal heats at a higher temperature than fire or other means leaving this thin crust cooked crisp with a few chars here and there.  Anyway, I dislike thick crust pizzas because my opinion is the crust can absorb/take away from the flavors on the pizza.  When Grimaldis opened (I actually was a subcontractor for part of the building so I was aware as it was coming into town) I decided to try and I absolutely think it's the best pizza in Vegas minus specialty gourmet pizzas which I give to Metro. The crust in my opinion is great, the fire roasted pepper yummy, the thick pepperoni, sausage extremely flavorful, And get this ,, the few people in here complaining about the cheese IT\"S WHOLE SLICED MOZZARELLA.  I don't know if you understand that when a pizza place uses pre shredded cheese it looses some flavor as it has to be preserved  and prevented from hardening and sticking together.  The whole slices of cheese on Grimaldis pizza adds a great effect and provides in my opinion the best flavor the cheese can offer. If you want piles of shredded cheese that starts stretching and stringing as you have to keep pulling it away from you as you try to eat then you won't like Grimaldis.  Basically, IT's all about proportions.  I think Grimaldis has found the best, crust,cheese, sauce proportion for me. I can taste everything without getting full on the first slice.  Also, sign up for their email and get a free large pizza every year for your Birthday,, it's a great deal LOL.\nIf you decide Grimaldis doesn't have the toppings you desire then there's only one other place in vegas and that is Metro."

The waiters are mindful of who they are waiting on and my glass is never left empty.  I do consider Grimaldi's the best pizza in the area.  If I have a non-thin crust pizza craving, traditional pizza at Angelina's is option.  For the deep dish pan pizza, BJ's is available across the street.  But Grimaldi's Pizza is very good."

So much so, that a nearby table of adults with young children cancelled their order and left because of their foul language. Myself and my guest were likewise offended. One of the men at the table was permitted to enter and dine in bare feet, which was repulsive. \n\nI called for the manager to ask that he take appropriate action. His comment was \"I've already spoken to them and there was nothing more I could do.\" I mentioned to him about the man being permitted to dine in bare feet and that being a health issue and potentially liability should he step on glass or other foreign matter. He just shrugged his shoulders and said \"I'm sorry.\" \n\nThis manager was approximately 6'3\" and 250 lbs. and seemed frightened to confront and order them to leave. I heard from some of the other dinners and they too were appalled and disgusted that the \"manager\" just let these unruly persons ruin their dinner as well.

Add in the $2.50 per soft drink, and I was starting to feel like the meal just wasn't worth it. \n\nThe caprese salad as an appetizer was a great start to our meal-although it could have used a little salt.

The sauces are on par with any other pizza place. The salads are a good size. When considering sandwiches, they are big but coated in the same lack luster sauce.

I really enjoyed it I'll be back for more!\n\nWe also got the Reese's cheesecake. It was so good!!! I actually think it was even better than the pizza! I feel like I gained 5 pounds after that meal but it was all worth it!!! I'd do it all over again!!"

One of the secret to their pizza & salads is that you can customize them with some of the most awesome ingredients available. I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes, but here, I put them on everything. They are truly the bomb!\n\nMy last adventure here was last night, but not as a customer in the traditional sense. I work for PostMates as a delivery driver & was picking up an order for a regular customer of mine.The 'take out' staff was extremely helpful, thorough & made sure my order was perfect. While it means a lot to me as a delivery driver, it means so much more to my/their customers. No missing items, always crushed pepper & parm, utensils, etc. They make my job EASY. If you want to find out for yourself, just download the app and put in code KCOLE for $10 in delivery credit. Not only will you be getting some of the best pizza in town, you'll be getting some of the best service as well."

This particular location is great, clean, well managed, with wonderful servers who are very helpful and accommodating but they don't 'hover'.\n\nWe were lucky enough to get seated in the little private area out of the noise and nobody else was seated in the rooms with us.  Very nice!  The main dining room does get loud so if you like it quiet, ask for this room.\n\nThe Pizza?  Oh yeah, the pizza.  Freakin' GOOD.  Especially if you like that thin crust.  We all ordered our own (yes, way too much food) but it was nice to customize exactly what I wanted and not have to share my precious bounty.\n\nI don't ever do deserts.  But our waiter talked us into ordering an Oreo Cheesecake.

In the form of a white pizza.....\n\nI forgot I was a part of their Birthday Club and low and behold I get the email wishing me Happy Birthday in the form of a free pizza. It didn't end up being completely free, but I don't care. What I do care about is I tasted the glory in their white sauce pizza with sausage. It was garlicky, it was crispy and slightly chewy and just the right amount of every ingredient. I would have liked a little more fresh Basil, but that is the story of my life. The sausage was savory and spicy without overpowering the other ingredients.This pizza was just what I needed and I have even almost gone back. I know, it's insane.\n\nDownfalls. Because you know I gots sum;)\n\n1. Loud, loud, loud. I'm not sure if it's because of the flooring or brick walls, but I could not think it was so terribly loud and it gave me extreme anxiety. My hearing is better than most so imagine being able to hear twenty conversations at once. Yeah, bad news bears. Next time I return I will be wearing headphones.\n\n2. Bright lights. Pet peeve is bright lights in a restaurant in the evening. I don't need to see or hear the fifty kids fondling their raw dough, wasting the parm on the table and pretending to make their own za. I also don't need to see my date's pores. Ever.\n\n3. 4pm. Whatever you do 4pm is not the time to come to Grimaldi's. They do something to the oven at that time for about 20-30 minutes and you cannot get a pizza. Instead you have to eat a boring salad with a bitter dressing and stare at each other. You can't talk because you can't hear each other over the noise. I really think the chef might just be celebrating 4:20p everyday getting erie mon. Whatever he did my pie tasted like a million bucks so keep on keepin on Chef pizza dude. \n\nWill I return? Oh hellz yeah. Just for the Large White Sauce with Garlic and Sausage and extra Basil pie. Kudos Grimaldi's for redeeming yourself. I am feelin' you big time. Until we meet again my new white saucy friend."

If you enjoy thin crust coal brick oven pizza you will love this pizza. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple, they offer pizza and salad and a few basic appetizers, that's it. You really only have the option of ordering pizza here. Great for us, not the place to go if you are looking for anything else. They offer 3 sizes of pizza - personal (plenty for 2 adults), medium and large. The base prices are $14, $16, $18 and each topping that you add runs about $2 each. Three great things about this pizza - the crust, the sauce and the cheese. The cheese is excellent,fresh mozzarella is wonderful. I love coffee and the coffee is great here too. \n\nThey don't have a kids menu but Grimaldis is kid friendly. My kids love to go here specifically because they get to play with pizza dough while they are waiting for the food the come out. I have noticed that not all servers automatically bring this out but once we ask, they always do. The kids have a lot of fun with the dough! \n\nGrimaldis is usually busy at peak times and there's usually a wait of 10-20 minutes. \n\nHighly recommend Grimaldis."

I love the layout too of this grimaldis because it has a bar on one side that has open seating to outside.

My food has always come out right though, so I wouldn't say this is a turn off from the food, which is always on point.\n\nThe pizzas have always been delicious no matter what I order.  My favorite here is the pesto pizza with red sauce, or a white pizza with fresh Italian sausage. Every pizza and dish is made to order and you can watch since the kitchen is in the back, but open.  I have also had the homemade desserts here, my favorite being the AMAZING cheesecake, some are seasonal but they always have original NY style. I have had their ceaser and house salads, both of which are good to share as a starter I think, before a pizza (so I feel less guilty!) The beer selection is alright, this is no brewery, but they have blue moon and some Italian beers or wine to match with your pizza.\n\nOverall I really just love the food in this place. I have been to them all over the valley and this is probably my favorite if not just for the pizza, the ambiance.  It is a nice dinner place for a date or special outing!

We went for dinner last night and everything was perfect, the food, weather, ambiance!\n\nWe ordered a small caesar salad to share, yes share, yes a small ($7).  A perfect portion for two.  The dressing was zesty, ample, and quite addicting.  The croutons were fresh, large, and crispy (but not jaw breaking).  The lettuce was fresh and green.  The parmesan was good but the stuff that was factory shredded, not freshly shaved.  I'm a sucker for freshly shaved parm, you know the stuff that resembles potato chips.  Regardless, the bf will be picking up a random caesar salad after work for me to chow down on.\n\nThe pizza was quite delightful!  Their crust is thin and flaky with very good flavor.  Their sauce gets two thumbs up for not being overpowering or chunky, like some of these pizza joints tend to get a little over zealous about.  And the cheese, oh the cheese...it's freshly made mozzarella!  Each pizza gets thin slices of this freshly made mozzarella!  Therefore, when your pizza is presented, it almost glows because the mozzarella is a beautifully brilliant white!  Grimaldi's uses some delicious toppings too, if you so choose to garnish your pie.  Instead of the traditional size pepperonis, they use miniature sized ones.  I think it makes the pepperoni pie easier to eat, but that's just my opinion.\n\nThe ambiance of the Eastern Ave. Grimaldi's is quite charming, even for being in a strip mall.  We here in Las Vegas are lucky to have such beautiful weather pretty much year round, therefore open air bistros like Grimaldi's are a gem on such gorgeous days/nights.  The layout of the restaurant is well-thought out.  Their bar is two-sided.  One side being for the patio, and the other side for the indoor bistro--kind of ingenious!  Let it be known, the bar does have draught beer on tap (Peroni, Blue Moon, Blue Moon Pumpkin, and a few others).  The wine menu is geared more towards everyday wines (most bottles under $50).  They have an assortment of reds, whites, blushes available by the glass and bottle.   Liquorwise, they are limited to basics, Bombay Sapphire, Three Olives Vodka, 1800, J.W. Black Label, Jack, etc.  So just remember when you order your cocktail, this is NOT an ultra lounge.  So don't be a snob just because they may not carry your favorite liquor, suck it up and try something different!\n\nI had a blast at Grimaldi's, not because of the bottle of Riesling or bottle of Pinot Noir, but because of being surrounded by good food, good ambiance, good service, and great company!"

They have a lovely outdoor dining area, with no smoking allowed, about 10 tables I think .  Also, there is a bar where you can sit either inside or out (there's a large rolling shutter that opens up).  Oh & there is absolutely no gaming.  If you ask me, that's a major plus!\n\nAs mentioned a small menu, but how many choices do you need with pizza that tasty?\n\nWe shared a small pizza- 1/2 pesto 1/2 white with meatballs, sausage, ricotta & roasted red peppers.  I preferred the pesto pizza, a lot more flavor & zestiness.  It was just crispy enough too.  Not too charred on the bottom, which is what I don't like about wood-fired or coal oven pizza.  It was really quite good. \n\nI can't wait to go back & try the calzones.  I may have to join the gym first, as I see me being very addicted to this place...\n\nUpdate 6/3/08:\nThe calzones rock.  Be careful of the service it has been quite good to so poor that I actually complained to a manager..."

            "review": "You might note that my original review starts with a disclaimer about my lack of pizza experience. I've gained a little experience since then, but maybe this place has worsened a little too.\n\nA year after my first visit, I returned to Grimaldi's for another birthday pizza. I ordered the same large pizza (red sauce) with meatballs. From the birthday coupon, I got $19 credit back for it again. I think prices have gone up though, with $16 for the base 18\" large pizza and $4 for the meatballs. I ended up having $1 worth of pizza to pay.\n\nLet's cut to the chase. Despite being quite hungry (I'd arrived straight from work), I wasn't very impressed with what I tasted this time around. The pizza just seemed pretty bland. Maybe some of the acidic tomato notes stood out, but not the sliced meatballs, and definitely not the cheese. I tried all sorts of condiments on top, including parmesan, red pepper flakes, and pepper, but I just wasn't getting much help. The table didn't even have oregano (or garlic, as I now recall) as it did last year, but I don't know how much those would have helped even if they'd been available.\n\nI should note that I ate some of the leftover pizza after taking it home and popping it in the oven, and that pizza stood out in terms of crispy crust and just having more of the flavors. Actually, it tasted hot, as opposed to the warm-ish pizza that our server was able to touch despite warning us of the temperature. I'm guessing that there was a delay at the restaurant from oven to table due to the hectic service during the already crowded dinner hours, and that lessened the experience.\n\nI would have considered keeping my rating at four stars for the pizza, but I also tried a dessert trio ($10) with half-sized portions of the tiramisu, Oreo cheesecake, and seasonal pumpkin cheesecake. Perhaps the latter was the most flavorful of the bunch, but again, they all seemed a little too bland and fleeting in flavor. The number of superior versions of all of these desserts outweigh the misses, so I can only conclude that the desserts are below average. I'd rather have the tiramisu at Trattoria Nakamura-ya again, the pumpkin cheesecake from Lazy Dog, or pretty much any slice from Cheesecake Factory (a place that's not even top of the line, mind you).\n\nI'll be back in a year, but I won't be too enthused. Furthermore, I'm not even going to consider returning until then. On top of having had good experiences at Flour & Barley (via a Yelp event) and Little Tony's, I know that I can customize a far more complex and delicious pizza at Blaze Pizza not too far down the street. I simply can't see the same luster in Grimaldi's as I did before."

I have a long history with Grimaldi's since they first came to Vegas. We usually pick up and take home.\n\nI feel they can do no wrong. The service is stellar, the food is great, and the place is poppin'. It isn't a large location, so if they get busy you may have to wait. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait, which was fine with us. We went to the bar outside (it has one side outside and one side in). We ordered drinks from (I believe her name was) Shandra and her service was fast and super friendly. I also started with a small Mediterranean salad no onions (devil's food).\n\nThe oven they cook in is a coal brick oven. The pizza comes in different sizes small, medium, and large. You can get tomato sauce, white pizza, or pesto. We get the large white pizza with pepperoni and fresh tomato all the time. Last night we added ricotta cheese on half. The second pizza we got was a large white with meatball, fresh tomato, mushrooms, and added ricotta on half. Why half you ask? Well, I am not a fan of ricotta at all. BUT let me tell you, their ricotta is the exception to everything I know about ricotta cheese. It is smooth, creamy, and not gritty at all.\n\nOf course it was delicious as always. The biggest downfall is you will pay $2-$4 per topping you get. We spent $100 with tip last night. It is expensive, but not a typical trip cost for my hubby and I. Normally it's around $25 plus tip for our regular. We didn't get dessert last night, but I have had their cheesecake. Holy moses it's delicious. \n\nI cannot say enough about Grimaldi's. If you haven't been, you need to go. Like, now."

The house sauce is flavorful, not overwhelming.  For a treat, I always order the pesto sauce, which tastes of fresh basil every time.  Their meaty toppings (sausage, pepperoni, etc.) are very good so if you are a traditional pizza eater, I suggest the sausage with roasted sweet peppers.  The only drawback is: toppings are $2-$4 each so the price can stack up quickly for a regular-ingredients pie.\n\nHowever, if you're in the mood for a different palette, order the pesto sauce with ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes, and grilled chicken.  I find that this combination puts together an absolutely delicious gourmet pizza seldom found elsewhere.  Fresh basil pesto, slightly sweet & lavish ricotta, top-quality sun-dried tomatoes, and tender grilled chicken always win me over at first bite."

It's a bit on the pricey side for the pie - it's not the place if you're looking for a cheap date - but when you're in the mood to gab with your friends over wine, beer, salads, and thin crust pizza, check this place out.\n\nThe salads are meant to be shared.  I like the feel of that.  I do love a good salad, but the pizza is what drew me back after my first visit.  The crust is nice and thin, with a slight chewy bite.  It's often a little charred around the edges, which I adore.  The cheese is thinly sliced fresh mozzarella.  It's subtle, with a hint of sweet, and even though mozz generally lacks flavor, there is something about this chewy white melty cheesy goodness that makes me say \"mmm\".  I really like how they smoosh up the Kalamata olives so that the little crushed pieces are splattered all over the pizza.\n\nPlus, they feature some local brews.  I enjoyed my pie with a Tenaya nut brown tonight.  Yay for supporting locals!  I think the biggest drawback is the lack of price breaks for topping combos.  Four toppings can cost you the price of the base pie, yowzahs.  At this Eastern Ave location there is some lovely outdoor seating (although I can think of better ambiance than Eastern Ave, but you can only ask for so much here in Hendertucky), and I find the indoor ambiance rather pleasant.  I've experienced nothing but friendly service.  It's a great place to grab a bite and a drink with a friend, and you'll leave with satisfied tastebuds and your stomach not overflowing with grease."

One time though, we got a different server, and I am not kidding when I say she was on drugs, so I guess you could say service is hit or miss.

Lunch is often thicker and softer but still delicious. Always good service and the occasional and very rare problem is always taken care of. After 5 or more years of eating here, this really is a great place and proves that you can get real pizza in the west. Avoid excessive toppings which can overwhelm the wonderful crust, keep it simple. Highly recommended.\n\nOne update. Recently (late 2015) a few of the pizzas have had skimpy toppings and very little cheese. I checked with the staff and they have not officially changed anything so it looks like one of the chefs is cutting back for some reason. We now check with the server that we are getting why we expect."

They had the outside bar open (why the hell you would want to sit outside in 100+ degrees, I don't know). The waiter was hilarious, and very lucky that I love all kinds of humor and sarcasm. Most people would've found him to be offensive.\n\nI loved the fact that they cook the pizzas in a traditional brick oven and hand toss their pizza dough.\n\nThe bread with olive oil/pepper/balsamic vinegar was rather horrible. I attribute it to the crappy olive oil and subpar bread (I hate to say it, but Macaroni Grill has the best). Something as simple as that turns me off.\nWe ordered two pizzas, each half and half.\nI had pepperoni, garlic, basil on the side, and fresh tomatoes. The basil was not fresh, it was brown and bitter.\n\nSomething very important to know about their pizza is that their \"pizza sauce\" has NO SPICES whatsoever. It's plain ol' tomato. That's why it's important to get the extra toppings. That's how they make their money. Each topping is $2+. I'm sorry, but I love my spices.\n\nHop on the 215 and get over to Joe's NY pizza by the Outlet Mall. THAT is pizza."

            "review": "Well, let me first start by saying my dinner last night at this place was me giving this place a second chance.   The first time I went I ordered my pizza with light sauce,   when my pizza arrived it had sauce oozing all over it.  The server was quite apologetic and offered me something else or to have the pizza remade, but I was with others and I didn't want to make them wait so I just opted to not eat.\n\nSo round two with this this place was even more traumatizing!   We arrived to wait for hostess to come up front because she was yakking it up with  the servers by the kitchen area.   We were seated in a little side room where we were pretty much ignored but I did get a good feel for the atmosphere.  After about 10 mins, waiting Server #1 strolled by and asked if we had been helped.   He gave me his name and took our drink and food order.  I once again mentioned I wanted light sauce on the pizza, no onions in my salad, and just a water w/lemon to drink.  Someone else brought our drinks and there was no lemon in the water so I asked Server # 2 for the lemon and he assured me he would bring back.  That never happened because a 3rd server brought our salads.   The salad was full of onions and so I did not eat it.  It sat on the edge of our table for about another 15mins until a 4th server brought our pizza.   The pizza was made correctly so I took a chance and asked this server for the lemon which he did return with and I gave him the salad and asked that he remove it from the bill because I couldn't eat it.\n\nThrough the meal no other servers ever checked on us.  In fact I had to flag down one just to get my daughter a drink refill.  The place was not very busy but yet all the Servers were clustered either by the kitchen or bar and everyone was laughing and joking amongst themselves, at one point I noted one Server swinging between the two counter areas.   I had to flag someone down again to get my pizza boxed and get my check.   I waited another 10 mins and no one ever came to get my check so I finally was annoyed and took the check to the front where once again the hostess was standing holding the front door open and chatting w/another employee and not at the hostess area.   \n\nI usually leave at 20% tip at most places because I do understand how hard Servers work as I used to work for a restaurant company, but this time the only tip I left was a note on the check stating they needed to improve their customer service.   As for the food it's mediocre at best, nothing really stands out about it, so I most definitely will not give them a third chance.  Their customer service ruined it completely for me.  :("

It was really good - pepperoni was a little thick so it was a pretty salty bite.  That said, this is one of the best, authentic, NY style pizzas I've had since coming back from NYC.  Just pretty darn expensive, like NYC.  Guess the whole coal burning, specially calibrated water pump and free range mozzarella costs that pretty penny.  So basically, our bill was $32 for a small caesar, small pizza with one topping, an Iced Tea and a rootbeer.  Again, it was good, but I probably wouldn't go there very often, even if there was a location in Socal."

You can get extra sauce for $2 which is kind of annoying, just put more sauce on please. My favorite little pepperonis that get all crispy at the edges.  We also ordered the antipasto salad and a house salad, that had an awesome mix of veg, and literally could have fed 8 ( there were 4 of us).

The crust was thin and crispy, with just the right amount of sauce to cheese ratio. The toppings tasted extremely fresh and the pizza was not oily. I'm one of those people who dab the pizza with a napkin if I see oil on it, but this time I didn't have to! They use a coal oven to cook their pizzas, which results in a very crispy crust. I heard they take Las Vegas water, purify it, and turn it in to the same composition as NY water for their pizza dough. I'm not sure if that's their secret or the oven, but it was delicious! \n\nAfter eating tons of pizza we were stuffed but....we decided to order dessert! And boy, were we not disappointed. We split a cannoli and yum it was delicious. The exterior shell was crisp, as if it was just stuffed! The filling was creamy and sweet, but not too sweet. The atmosphere was very pleasant, and the service was wonderful and attentive. The parking was also great. Since it's in a shopping mall area, there are a ton of spots. Plus, after eating about half a large pizza each (8 big slices in a large pizza) we were able to go shopping!"

Unfortunately, two-and-a-half stars wasn't an option on Yelp. \n\nWe recently moved to Vegas/Henderson. After all the buzz we'd heard and great reviews we'd read, we finally decided to give Grimaldi's (9595 S Eastern) a try for our first Vegas-area pizza experience. We were very disappointed. \n\nThis was probably the first pizza we'd ever ordered where we didn't take the leftovers home. We ate half a large between us, and had them toss the rest. \n\nWe noticed all the waitstaff were overselling the pizza and telling everyone who came in that it was the best pizza in town. In our humble opinion, the pizza should speak for itself. Sorry, but if this is the \"best pizza in town,\" then this town must have the worst pizza in the world. \n\nThe worst part was the crust. It was like a bland water cracker with black burned marks on the edges. It was dry, crispy, and flavorless. The pizza was kind of like a Carr's Table Wafer with a few toppings on it. In fact the pizza was so dry that The Mrs. ordered an extra side of marinara in an attempt to make it more palatable. Unfortunately this pizza was beyond hope. Even with the extra mozzarella The Mrs. had ordered, there still was barely enough cheese. \n\nIt was so thin that the waiter didn't even need a potholder to carry the pizza out. Two minutes after it hit the table it was cold. Perhaps if there had been some pizza and toppings it would have stayed warm longer. \n\nWe also noticed pictures of New York City all over the walls. Calling it a \"New York\" style or \"East Coast\" style pizza doesn't make it good. Maybe it was modeled after a really bad New York pizza. I'm from the East Coast (Boston), and have been to New York many times. There are a lot of different kinds of pizza available on the East Coast. My favorites were ooey, gooey, and had a flavorful chewy crust. Whether the crust is thick or thin, it's the texture that makes the difference. This Grimaldi's pizza crust had no texture or chewiness. It tasted as plain as a burnt cracker. The skimpy cheese and sauce didn't help either. \n\nOthers may differ, but personally I do not like black burnt portions on my pizza. Even the best pizza can get burned spots. I don't know if this happens from the oven being too hot or from an improper mixture in the crust. I've experienced this on many different pizzas and I'm just not a fan of it. Some people don't seem to mind it, and even the best pizza can occasionally suffer a burned spot and still be good, so I've come to accept it. It's still a negative for me, although not a deal-breaker. If that was the only issue with the Grimaldi's pizza, I wouldn't give it such a low rating. In this case, the black spots on the crust edges were just insult added to injury. \n\nPerhaps this would be good for someone who likes dry pizza. This was about the driest pizza we've ever eaten. Sorry, but we just don't like dry pizza. \n\nOn the plus side, the waitstaff was very nice. Also, our small side salad was huge and delicious. They also had a pretty nice wine selection."

Five stars from me and will make this our regular Friday dinner place. Thanks Bryna!!!   Jude"

I always bring out-of-town guests here because I think the food is great and different from most pizza places.  This place is not close to where I live but I go out of my way to get pizza here and it's worth it.\n\nLast night, the BF and I were meeting his aunt and uncle on that side of town, so I kindly offered to bring over some Grimaldi's. Yeah!  Pretty much always order the same thing, but last night I skipped the mediterannean sald I normally order and got two pizzas:\n\n1. mush, meatball, kalmata olives\n2. sundried tomatoes, pepperoni, kalmata olives\n\nSeriously, if you like kalmata olives, make sure you get some on your pizza.  Before Grimaldi's I had never had them on a pizza.  Now I'm addicted.\n\nI've tried the white pizza, but I'm not a fan of alfredo.  The pesto sauce is excellent, but I like red sauce on my pizzas.  I haven't even mentioned the staff.  Everyone is really cool and friendly.  I would probably still come here if the staff were a-holes, but fortunately, they're not!"

It may be different but its not the best pizza in the world or maybe it just taste better to you because of the name and they charge you so much for a pizza. I grew up in Brooklyn around the block from a pizza shop and have had may fair share of pizza all over NYC. They must be making the dough different here and the guy maintaining the coal oven and pizza isn't trained properly or oven isn't good.  You are supposed to have a slight smokey coal char flavor, not charred pizza. This style of pizza is only good straight out of oven and has a totally different taste and texture when you take it home to eat or reheat. Its best to eat it there if they get it correct but I have dinned there twice and both times it wasn't great. One time it was flabby and second time it was charred. Service was mediocre"

Pizza done right should not take too long.  I live in NJ and know about good pizza.  To have a Grimaldi's on the West Coast is a blessing.  My parents could never find good pizza out there.

This kind of pizza, large, floppy and often sold by the slice has been imitated in one way or another in every corner of the country to mixed results.  \n\nBut there is another sort of New York pizza that predates the style most (New Yorkers included) are familiar with. It's the kind of pizza made in a small handful of ancient pizzerias in New York city like Lomardi's, Grimaldi's and Totono's. It's thin crusted with a sweet tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan and/or romano, some dried oregano and fresh basil and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Mozzarella is used sparingly, about half as much as you'd expect. This is the style of the very first pizzas made in America by Neapolitan immigrants.  The distinguishing factor today is the once-common coal-fired brick oven running about 900 degrees that's capable of charring the crust before it browns the cheese.  The result is a striking palette of black, light brown, white, dark green and about five shades of red.\n\nI've never been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, but I have been to Totono's. And this style, the so-called New York Neapolitan, was one I thought I could only score in NYC.  Through the magic of Yelp, I found this improbable outpost while looking for a hassle-free, off the strip locale for a family dinner. Problem is, I talk too much and felt the need to find a real gem.  This couldn't have been easier.  I was shocked to see that NYC's favorite pizzeria had franchised, but this looks like a small chain run by a nephew of the original owner, with his blessings, assistance and recipes.  \n\nWe were quickly seated through the help of a call-ahead quasi-reservation at the best table in the house, right next to the pizza prep station.  The pies were nearly flawless.  I went with extra basil and I sampled the pepperoni and sausage. There were six of us, all northeast natives, two of which have lived in Italy, and all of us ranked this as our favorite or near-favorite pizza ever.  Is it my favorite?  I'm not sure, but it's 2nd or third at worst.  It has to be the best in Vegas and it will be a mandatory stop every time I'm in town.\n\nThey don't have a line out the door yet, so check it out before the word spreads.  Service is attentive and polite, which isn't very \"East Coast\" of them, but that's one part of back home that I don't miss. Five mother-f'n stars."

I thought the food was pretty good, except for the fact that there was clearly a cheese shortage. Ordering extra cheese wasn't enough. I suppose you would have to order extra, extra, extra cheese if you wanted to actually taste the cheese on your pizza. Oh well, the flavor was good. The white pizza with garlic and mushrooms was excellent. Wow, I would definitely order that again. \n\nHere's the problem with the place - it was REALLY uncomfortable. First of all, when we arrived they made us stand at the front with a bunch of young children until every single person in our party arrived. That policy is extremely irritating for people with young children or elderly in the group. There really wasn't a good place to sit and wait, but we did our best crammed in by the front door. Once everyone arrived, they brought us to our table. That's when things got worse. \n\nThe table was REALLY bad. We were so crammed in that we could barely move. I dreaded each time that a child had to go to the bathroom, or that I had to stand up to do something. I must have banged into the people behind me ten times. I know that table hated me, but come on, I wear a size 4 -- I should be able to stand up to do something briefly and sit down without shoving my behind in anyone's face. That's not asking for too much room. To my dismay, most of the time I banged the chairs at adjacent tables, and found myself apologizing over and over throughout dinner. I was tempted to stand up and just move our entire table, but thought that would make a scene, so I didn't. \n\nThe food was pretty good. The atmosphere was terrible. I might come here again with just one friend, but I would be careful when agreeing to sit at a particular dining table. Decent food, but an uncomfortable dining experience."

I love italian food.\n\nI love the thin crust, crispy, saucey, cheesey variety.  Grimaldi's in NYC is better than Vegas.  Pizza in NYC generally speaking tastes different than anywhere else.  Most pizzeria owners that I know back home, say its the water that makes it taste different, and I actually have to agree.  \n\nGrimaldi's here make a great effort in providing NYC Style pizza.  The gf and I had a large pie with sweet red peppers, sausage and onions.  It's thin and crispy.  Saucey and cheesey however, it is not!  Seemed like they skimped on the sauce (which is their signature) and the cheese.  Especially, when the sauce and cheese are the main components of the pizza.  It was good, but not great.  Sadly, I left here unimpressed and missing NY a little more.\n\nAtmosphere was good, they have an outdoor patio and full bar with a few flatscreens to watch the games.\n\nHeard Giovanni's is better.  Will try Giovanni's next time I have a pizza craving.  \n\n**Make that Settebello's in Henderson**"

We tried their white garlic sauce which was so delicious! Even my friend who claims she hates white sauce loved it! \n\nWe started off the meal with the Grimaldi house salad which comes with a very light vinegrette. Awesome salad to start the meal. \n\nSo overall, this place is AMAZING! You have to come try it. The crust is just to die for, and the white sauce is perfect. It wasn't too overpowerful or too creamy. A MUST!"

Bottom line, very thin crust, light on the sauce, a little over priced, but still very well worth the visit & the price. Without a doubt I highly recommend Grimaldi's. The pepperoni & kalmata olives large pizza is my absolute favorite. I have probably gotten 20 people hooked on their pizza & it's turned into a must go to lunch spot for my sales crew. The service is excellent & Vince & Rob do a super job with the staff. My wife though thinks it's highly overrated & would rather have Verrazano's or Villa.

I received prompt attention and noticed the pizza in the box was a small.  The bartender offered to throw in a drink to make it up, or make a new pizza.  I let it go, the small was big enough.  Got it home. Wow! a crispy, cracker-like crust.  Slices of excellent mozzarella left no greasy pools.  The tomato sauce was properly applied.  A bit extra basil made this a terrific mushroom pizza.

(1) We were seated by the hostess and waited 15 min before I called over a waiter and was told that he was not my waiter. He took the orders and sent for my waiter. 5 min later he showed up and from then on it was fine. (2) For a large pizza with 3 toppings $24 was on the high side but was comparable to Metro Pizza which charged slightly more but gave less toppings per pizza. Putting it in perspective, a good dish at a good Italian restaurant cost about $25. Overall, I would go back for their thin crust pizza despite the slow service and pricey charge, because it was good."

He goes for lunch a couple times a month and I've always said \"I'll try it sometime.\"  Part of the problem was that it's right by my favorite Mexican fast food place, Cafe Rio.  Well, tonight we finally tried the famous Grimaldi's and I'll tell you what, this is a \"I'll go on a diet tomorrow\" kind of restaurant.  \n\nWe were the leading edge of the dinner crowd so no problem getting preferred seating indoors.  Quick attention by Anthony, our capable, informative and entertaining server.  When we declared our \"first time visitor\" status, he patiently explained the three different styles of pizza, the salads, and \"Oh, yes, we have calzone too!\" \n\nWe settled on a split medium, 1/2 ham/pepperoni and 1/2 pesto & jalapeno & basil (can you tell which one is the meat eater?).  Anthony wisely paired our selection with a Pinot Noir from Italy that matched perfectly.  So much so, we trusted him and got the bottle to finish at the castle (home).\n\nPizza is like sex, it's never bad unless you don't give it a chance.  And in this case, this was one of THE BEST PIZZA's I've ever had.  Timely, crisp, tasty, aromatic (and perfectly matching wine) and absolutely hit the spot.  I declared early that I would save room for Bailey's oreo cookie crust cheese cake.  I almost faltered and finished my 1/2 of the pizza which would have left me too stuffed.\n\nBut, I exhibited massive amounts of discipline and saved one slice for later consumpiton and ordered the heralded cheesecake (with two forks 'cuz I'm that kind of date).  Oh My GOSH!!!  This stuff should be on the front page of the Review Journal.  Seriously!  I'm not a big fan of sweets, but I can appreciate a near perfect taste when given the chance.  Presentation = 10, texture = 10, taste = 10 and memory = 10.  Well done, Grimaldi's!!\n\nBefore we left, we had the chance to give our thanks and kudos to Gino for having such an awesome place.  So maybe it took three years to finally try this place, it won't take very long before our next visit.  Well done everyone!"

            "review": "Best pizza in Las Vegas!!  I always get a large pepperoni and sausage pizza here.  I normally order pepperoni and mushroom at other places, but the mushroom makes the pizza a little soggy here.  Regardless, the pepperoni and sausage combination is excellent for me.  The mozarella cheese is unlike any other compared to the pizza places around here.  Plus, the pepperoni is fantastic, the right combination of spices and the tasty sausage complements it very well.  The thin crust is cooked perfectly, as it is not too crispy and not toooo limp and soggy.  As noted, I always get a large and eat the left overs the next morning or lunch.  It does not lose its taste.\n\nI share the mediterranean salad with my wife.  The portions are huge, so we order a small.\n\nThe service is excellent here, but does get busy around 6-730pm during the weekends.  So, you might expect some wait time during those hours.\n\nGreat place to go if you have kids.  The waiter sometimes give kids pizza dough to play with.\n\nWhenever I have visitors from out of town and want to experience something new, but don't want to go to the Strip, this place is one of my first suggestions, when they are in the mood for Italian/American.\n\nThe pizza is a little pricey if you compare it to pizza chains, but this place is well worth it.  The great taste and service is consistent, which keeps me coming back.\n\nIf you join their email list, they send you great deals, such as getting a free large pizza (dine-in) during your birthday week..."

Someone is desperate just to say they left their boring homes. I ordered my pizza by phone to be picked up. 1. I'm told they don't have green peppers only sweet red. Fine I can handle that.  2. I'm told 20 minutes it will be ready.  I arrive in 15. The pizza is ready. But it takes 10 minutes for the bartender, who is also the carry-out cashier to wait on me. 3. The pizza is no longer piping hot.  4. The pizza was supposed to be Italian sausage & \"Red peppers\"! I'm posting a photo of the pizza. See if you can find the sausage. I think there is more sausage on McDonald's sausage biscuit sandwich. I can here Clara Peller yelling \"where's the beef\" from her grave. 5. The only reason that I'm able to give this place a star, is because the pizza was in fact very tasty. The sausage was very good when you could find a bite. Good sauce and fresh peppers.   I will probably try them again and order double sausage. Maybe I can put it all on one half and say I'm eating a SAUSAGE pizza!!!"

Salad was great, and even the spines of the greens were sweet. Pizza was very nice, if different from what I'm used to. Its crust was a nice thin and crisp situation that did not get soggy at any time, thus making it better than what I got from nearby Novecento. And I'm going to say that the cheese and sauce were good but not as good as the also-nearby Montesano's Eateria - but Montesano's had a thicker, breadier crust that interfered too much with the other ingredients in my opinion.\n\nStaff were friendly, water tasted clean, and ambiance was nice. We came in during a slow time, so it wasn't busy or loud, but I can see how it would get very busy and very loud during dinner."

The ambiance inside is nice and the service is pretty good, so you feel ok sitting in there and hanging out for a while with a couple beers and a pie, unlike, say, Giovanni's up the road. \nMain point: I really like the pizza. Nice thin crust, so you don't feel like you're taking in 3000 calories (I'm not saying you're not....you may be...it just doesn't feel like it). The cheese is (I think) mozzarella, so it has a really good flavor that is different from your typical take out place. All the toppings are really good and seem pretty high quality.\nThe side salads are also really good. \nOne star off for the high prices and (like others have noted) the fact that you can't order a specialty pizza. Instead, you have to get a large ($18 for cheese I think) and then add on your toppings at $2-4 each. If you get 4 or 5 toppings, you're looking at like $30+ for a pizza. But hey, that's another reason why I say this is a \"night out\" place and not a \"pizza to go\" place."

Bring on the Grimaldis Margarita pizza!  They nailed it!  The slightly sweet Marinara sauce, thin sliced fresh mozzarella rounds and fresh basil leaves are the trio of flavors that define this pie.  \n\nFor those hailing from the Big Apple folding a slice is the only way you can walk and eat in the subway or as you rush to your next destination. When folded the end should not sag and drop its toppings if you're consuming a \"plain pie\".  It's survival 101.  Try it on your slice at Grimaldis...it passed the test.\n\nMy recent trip to Vegas was the second time I've been to this establishment.  It was on my punch-list since my last trip 2 years earlier.  My BW another couple and I shared a large freshly prepared house salad (easily enough for 4-6 hungry eaters), some draft brews and the large Margarita pie made up our dinner out.  Service was efficient and fast (perhaps too fast since we were still passing the salad bowl around when the pie came).  The dining space was a little noisier than I like but, when the pizza arrived, no one needed to talk.  The pizza disappeared rapidly and I easily could have taken down another slice without much encouragement.  A TOTALLY enjoyable dinner for 4 under $50 is hard to come by in Vegas. \n\nOh yes, before we left Sin City a week later we went back for a 2nd time.  That's something to say in a town filled with wall to wall restaurants!"

I think it's because maybe the mozzarella isn't as fresh, maybe the sauce - I couldn't figure it out. It's good pizza. Slightly better than the one they sell late night at Cosmopolitan. It is authentic NY style but just not as good as their NY location. In terms of other pizza joints in Vegas, it's probably one of the best if not the best. I had no problems with my service at this location or the Palazzo location. If you're on a budget I suggest the pizza at the Cosmo, otherwise this is probably the best Vegas has to offer."

We also ordered a small chicken and artichokes pesto pizza which was good but was really heavily topped with cheese.  Typically a thin crust pizza has fewer toppings than a thicker crust pizza but these were filled with toppings.  The Caesar salad was great, not overly dressed and a small was plenty to split between two people.   Also, a large pizza is 18 inches - so make sure you're hungry!"

Sit in the \"courtyard,\" one of the few places to sit outside in a city of resplendent sunshine, even if it's basically in a fucking parking lot (seriously, why aren't there more places to sit outside in vegas?). Smile faintly as a slight breeze drifts past your table, assuming it's the wind rather than the exhaust from the gargantuan yellow Hummer idling nearby.\n\n2.  Go light on toppings, which at $2-4 bucks a pop can easily make you shell out $20+ for a personal-sized pie\n\n3.  Don't worry about the prices. Realize you're at a pizza restaurant, not dominos. Consider it an import tax for bringing yet another storied New York restaurant to Vegas (Carnegie/Stage delis and Rao's being other examples)\n\n4.  Expect to enjoy your pizza, but not be blown away. Enjoy the thin, chewy crust as it mingles with the sauce, mozzarella, and your topping(s) of choice without thinking too much about it. Just chew, swallow, breathe, drink and repeat. Like a robot...eating pizza...in Henderson...with other pizza-eating robots. Know that if you start to think too much, you'll realize there's better pizza on this Earth, especially in New York, where at least you'd have some cool surroundings and interesting people mixed in with your dining experience. Instead, just eat your pizza, know it's good but not awesome and that you paid too much for it, but be happy.\n\n5.  Resist the urge to dry-hump anything on your way out, even the surly bartender who was nice enough to take your order in spite of the broomstick lodged far into his colon. Save your dry-humps until you return home, where at least they'll be appreciated by your cat and/or living room furniture.\n\n6.  Fart silently but crushingly on your way out the door, allowing your essence to annihilate the hostess and waft slowly through the restaurant, mixing with and then dominating the amalgam of cheap perfume and pizza odors which usually inhabit Grimaldi's. Ignore any screams or vomiting sounds coming from the restaurant as you open your car door, leave the parking lot, and cruise towards highway 215.\n\n7.  Grin ear-to-ear, knowing you've just had an enjoyable meal at an overpriced, but decent pizza joint. \n\n8.  Go home and get your dry-hump on, STAT."

Coal ovens might have been the thing back in the early days and they are experiencing a bit of a renaissance with Grimaldi's and others, but modern NY pizza comes out of normal ovens, has oregano already on the slice, has that droopy tip and also that small layer of grease drips onto your paper plate. That being said, GRimaldi's is one of the best gourmet pizza's in town and I guess the country now. At $20 a pizza that's the category it belongs in, but the staff is very friendly and the large meatball pie I consumed at the bar was hot, fresh and excellent. I hope when this place has 80 restaurants the quality will remain the same. It's sad to see another good place turn into a monster chain, but greed rules these days and this joint could turn into a Chili's of Pizza someday - I hope not."

So Grimaldi's, to me, is more than just another pizza joint.  \n\nGrimaldi's is what true Italian cuisine is all about.  Stated simply, ingredients.  Use ingredients that are the best and in season in your region and you will have wonderful results.  Unfortunately, we are in the middle of the desert where nothing fun to eat grows.  Luckily, everyone ships to Vegas.\n\n  When something is so simple as dough, cheese and sauce, the ingredients have to be the best.  Grimaldi's has a supplier from Italy that imports their tomatoes for them; they even use bottled water to make their dough.  I would think that pizza made from Vegas water would have to be subpar.  We have the worst water I've tasted in the states.  Their toppings, ranging from the pepperoni to the Ricotta cheeses, are all superior to any I've tasted in town.   \n\nThe artist who sculpts the pie also makes a huge difference.  The dough is hand tossed.  I loved watching the head pizza maker, at the time, dance the dough on his finger tips.  His pies were, by far, superior to pies made from some of the other pie makers.  The artist turns the pie while it's in the oven, moving it closer or further from the coals.  This helps to ensure a tasty crust.  There have been a few times when I've eaten there and the pie was delicious with a flaky crusty crust.  There have been other times when the pie was undercooked for my liking and not as crispy.  But, overall, an excellent pie with gourmet ingredients.\n\nSo Grimaldi's, to me, is a place of nostalgia and of mixed feelings of a different time in my life.  The little pizzeria, to me, is quintessential East Coast and Italy.  The former is where I grew up; the latter I dream of going.  I still love Grimaldi's to this day."

It usually is the only reason why I would cross town to the eastside.  But now they have a summerlin location so it's easier to get my fav pizza in town."

Sometimes we order the antipasto which is pretty standard, nothing to rave about. The last time we went, we found out they make their own desserts and there was some kind of special on them. I believe we tried the oreo cheesecake? It was so worth it! They only bad thing is the parking. Theres just not that many spaces especially during the busy times. The service is great and if you have kids, they give them pizza dough to play with."

Friends of mine who lived in Vegas wanted to take me to Grimaldi's while I was in town last month. I have to say I was impressed!! We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday night and it was busy, so busy I thought there would be at least a 20-30 minute wait but I was wrong we got a table right away. Our table was located right in front of the kitchen were the guys were making the pizza's. When I sat down and saw the brick-oven pizza's coming out of the oven I knew I was in for a treat!! They were thin crusted topped with fresh ingredients and a brickoven/coal bottom. \n\nWe started off with the cold antipasti platter. Italian meats, cheeses, olives and fresh foccacia bread. Your typical cold antipasti platter, you can't go wrong. \n\nFor dinner we ordered a Large pizza; half with pesto, pepperoni and onions and the other half; tomato sauce, sausage, mushrooms, artichokes and olives. They both were great! I would have to say the tomato, veggies and sausage side was my favorite however I really enjoyed the mini peperoni's that were on the other size, usually its large slices of pepperoni. \n\nGrimaldi's also has a great wine selection. Since my friends are regulars the server was kind enough to offer me help on selecting a glass of white wine and even brought me out a few samples! \n\nThe restaurant is a fun, casual atmosphere with bar half inside and half outside with outside seating. Perfect for a warm but cool Vegas night! I would definitely recommend checking this place out!"

Grimaldi's on Eastern has always delivered a solid pie that reminds us of back home. See people complaining about the crust and I think they are simply uneducated. The crisp and darkened crust is the way this \"coal oven\" pie is served. That coal oven taste is transferred into the crust and gives it amazing consistency and flavor. This is not the Albanian owned knock off pizza parlors that most Vegas locals have grown accustomed to eating. \n\nI like to add the Ricotta Cheese, fresh tomatoes and sausage to my pie. I also like artichokes and think they make a decent topping along with olives. \n\nThe Caprese salad here is the bomb. I like to add salami for an additional $2 more (see my pics). \n\nI only removed a star for two reasons: 1) the cost seems a little too high for pizza. It tastes good and I am a customer, I only feel like we would go more if it was priced appropriately. 2) service can be spotty when you eat in. Had to get up and track down our waitress last night to take our order. \n\nLastly, Grimadi's makes for great left over cold pizza. Make sure you take a couple slices home for cold pizza breakfast the next day!"

If it is made of bread, cheese and tomato sauce i am there, and i am one happy woman!!\n\nBut the pizzas at Grimaldi's well you could prop me up at the bar and keep feeding me slices of heaven until i burst like Mr Creosote (Monty Python reference there kids!!) I ordered a large (tomato sauce) pizza with mushrooms, fresh chopped tomatoes, roasted sweet red peppers and garlic...no meat for me folks sorry!! Also a caprasie (also known as a tri-colour) salad for an appetizer and a small house salad to go with my pizza.\n\nThe Caprasie salad ($7) was perfect to share and came with the dinkiest pieces of bread to top with basil, Roma tomatoes and home made mozzarella..yummy! The small house salad ($5) was again more than enough to share between two people and really complimented the pizza, the salad dressing was flavorful but didn't over power the dish.\n\n\nAnd now we get to may favorite part the pizza, like i said i love pizzas, but this one has topped my charts! The base was beautifully cooked, it was a good thin crust hand tossed kinda base, but it was still soft and amazingly fresh tasting. They had amazingly managed to make it completely uncracker like which most wood/coal fired pizza places seem to make their bases. The \"secret\" tomato sauce was sweet with just the right amount of herbs, not over powering that it makes your eyes water, but with a damn good flavour! The toppings...well the mushrooms were beautiful, not gritty and not so small that you couldn't find them; the fresh tomatoes were sweet and juicy, the sweet red peppers...oh my god they were amazing a slight spicy flavour enhanced by the sweet roasted yumminess of the peppers! Lastly the garlic, wow wee it's a good thing I'm sitting here by myself as wow i can still taste the garlic and it's been a loooooong time since i ate it!\n\nWell all in all it was a great experience, the total bill came to $50, and this included a half carafe of pg and 2 large glasses or Perioni beer.\n\nSo the down side, yes it did take FOREVER for the food to get served, yes the wait staff was not the jolliest i have ever encountered.....but for me the food totally makes up for it! \n\nSo on my recommendation, go to Grimaldi's order the pizza, salad, beer or wine...and just remember to carry a book and a bag of pretzels to tie you over until the really food comes out, because ladies and gentlemen it is totally worth waiting for!"

I made the mistake of going at around 4pm when they were switching the coals out. It has a nice bar that opens out to a patio area that is open during the warmer season. It has a good location but I had trouble finding it at first. I couldn't see a sign for it until I passed it.\n\nFood:\n\nI really really enjoyed their pizza. Whenever I go, I always get the meatball topping and it is superb. They take the homemade meatballs and slice them thin and place them as toppings. The crust is nice and thin and the freshness of their ingredients from the fresh mozzarella and their basil. The sauce is quite flavorful and tasty. I was talking to one of their managers and I explained this was my first time dining and he told me a little bit about where they come from. He explained to me that they balance their ph of the water to match it just like NYC. I was really impressed that they did that, as it shows a dedication to great pizza. They also serve white pizza if that is something you enjoy. \n\nService:\n\nThe waitress was very efficient. She took my drink order and asked if it was my first time dining. I can't remember her name but she was very friendly and knew the menu very well. I ordered my personal pizza and it only seemed like a couple of minutes and it came out warm, fresh and toasty. She did a wonderful job on asking about my food and making sure my drink was always full. Kudos to her. \n\nQuality:\n\nFresh, fresh, and fresh. Their ingredients are not skimped on and you can taste the freshness in their produce and sauces. I don't think you will be disappointed. \n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nGrimaldi's is definitely my choice for a sit down pizza joint. The freshness of their ingredients their warm and welcoming staff and their dedication to great pizza shows that their restaurant will be and continue to be successful and their patrons will spread the word and continue to come back. They obviously know what needs to be done to run a great restaurant. I know I will be coming back and I will bring my friends along as well."

The waiter was very patient in explaining all the different styles and options you have to choose from with the pizzas. We settled on a large with chicken and cheese on top (3 of us). The pizza had so much flavor! All 3 of us tore that pie apart in no time! It never stood a chance! ;)\n\nOur drinks never reached the bottom before quickly being refilled. The prices were fair and definately well worth it for the product you recieved!\n\nOnly negative at all in the whole experience was that when we were finished, the server asked us twice if we wanted desert, which we politely declined. We than waited for our bill....and waited. It wasn't a \"Burger-Dog-ish\" time wait...but it was starting to become a bit frustrating until a sweet lady swooped in and sped things up a bit. By no means a deal breaker, as we will certainly be back in the near future, especially when out of town relatives are visiting!\n\nI highly recommend Grimaldis!!"

We called ahead to let them know we had a party of 13 coming and they informed us that they don't take reservations, but if we get there before 5:30pm we should be fine. Okay. We head down and arrive at 5:30. As one of our party enters one of the hosts says, \"Oh you must be the party of 13.\" Yup, we have 13 and called ahead, but were told you don't hold tables. ANOTHER party of 13 enters right after us. They claim that they called ahead and were told a table would be prepared for them. The host staff then proceeded to seat the other party ahead of us! Really!?! We stood in front of the cold, crowded entrance for over a half hour waiting for our table. \n\nI really don't feel this way often, but we were all disgusted with how we were treated. I talked to the manager afterward who seemed to me to be pretty disingenuous. Like, \"Yea, yea, that's terrible, we're so sorry. Wow, we feel so bad, is that all? Oh we'll discount your bill.\" She ended up taking $10 bucks off, which wasn't what we were looking for; but ended up being a slap in the face. \n\nThis review is intended to reflect this particular location. We love the food at Grimaldi's but will most likely drive across town to a different location in the future. \n\nEasily the worst dining experience we've experienced this year."

The cost is pretty pricey, which usually leads to me deciding to go with a one topping pie - never mind blowing. Plus, I find it odd that they don't have specialty pies where you can realize some savings by getting a crazy combo they've dreamed up. Is that amateur of me?\n\nThe star for me, however, is the salad. Even a house salad manages to impress with super fresh ingredients and large serving portion.

You can't get great pizza for Pizza Hut prices. Today I also realized that the service there is really good. I also appreciate they carry Lavazza coffee and when they refill your cup they bring you a whole new fresh cup from the kitchen instead of just \"topping you off\". \nThe people seem genuinely friendly and the place is very clean and open. I see a lot of families there having a nice meal which is great to see these days. \nNext time you want a good pie with quality ingredients, give them a whirl.

Pizzas made at Grimaldi's are thin (my favorite kind) and they use large slices of mozzarella cheese, the best tasting pizza sauce (just the right amount of tomato, salt, and spices), and whatever toppings you prefer. I also order a delicious caesar salad with my meal every time. Every bite is like a piece of heaven in your mouth. Even pizza leftovers the next day taste awesome! \n\nI fancy the bar layout because it has two sides, one inside and one outside for the patio. I had a house wine once, which was tasty. More recently, I order the Honeymoon beer draft, which I have yet to find elsewhere. Lots of drink selections are available, including some draft beers from local breweries. \n\nThe service here has been tremendous lately. I used to dislike the young and snotty hostesses, but I haven't seen them in months (hmm, i wonder why lol). The bartender was very friendly and social. She even let me try some draft beer from a local brewery. \n\nIts about a 10 minute drive from my place, so I often go there more times than I should! They don't deliver, but take-out ordering is a painless procedure done at the cashier located at the bar. This place is hype-worthy. I've even gotten my g/f and parents hooked on Grimaldi's!"

They had plenty of recommendations (Everthing was basically recommended, and I'm going to have to agree!)\n\nNote: It is all thin-crust goodness! From the classic sauce, to the white sauce, all the way to the pesto sauce-- all G double O D = GOOD! There is also a list of toppings you may choose from (tomatoes, mushroom, SUN DRIED TOMATOES, anchovies, and the list goes on), and also different sizes of pizza. I'd recommend the biggest one (you know, so you can save the rest for later. You gotta strategize!!). So about the pizza, I'll leave it at that. Now it's your turn to try it!\n\nNow onto the desserts! I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, but I'll definitely eat a slice here! There is a variety to choose from as well (RECURRING THEME: so many to choose from, all so GOOD)! I have personally tried the oreo cheesecake (I highly recommend), original NY style, and the pumpkin cheesecake... which were all just perfection melting in my mouth! Yes, melt it does. The consistency of the cheesecake is just so perfect, probably why I'll only like cheesecake here at Grimaldi's!! Aside from the cheesecake, you must try the cannoli!!! JUST DO IT!\n\nFUN FACT: Grimaldi's has a unique water system, where their water comes directly from NY, to get that authentic NY style pizza. DID I GET YOU NOW??...\n\nI HOPE SO... GO NOW!

Nevertheless, it's a good pie and bring back memories.\n\nTip: Get half and half.   Typically most people go red but try out the white, it's just as good."

NExt time I would liek to stay and eat there instead of take-out... especially since the pizza can lose some of it's integrity in transit.\n\nSo we got the pepperoni pizza home.  It is a thin crust plenty of toppings.  This is way different than your average delivery pizza.  It was good.  Real mozzerella cheese and real pepperoni.  I really enjoyed this pizza.  Kind of an artisan pizza - I think these people are trying to make a good pizza.\n\nJust a personal note, and I am objective in my reviews so this does not take down the rating - just a personal issue.  I do not like a pretensous type of pizza joint.  I want a regular type of place - nothing fancy.  Also, over $40 for 2 pizzas!!! Digity dang. \n\nSo this is a nice place - tony for a pizza joint... it serves real good pizza."

I am not a fan of places that have a base price for the food that's already pricey and then charge additional $1-2 for each topping.  The pizza though is good; once you eat good pizza, it's hard to go back to crap like Little Caesar's.  (Although LC's and $5 pizzas got me through law school.)    \n\nCustomer service is excellent, much better than Settebello.  Overall, I'm a fan but find it's a \"once in awhile\" outing."

Grimaldi's was hidden in a back corner and we almost missed it but the pizza smelled really good and I'm glad we stopped! We split a Caesar salad and a small pizza and it was plenty! The service was very attentive for any restaurant let alone a mall restaurant and faster than I expected for pizza. The salad was dressed perfectly. Honestly: it was awesome! After 2 days in Vegas it was exactly what I needed. Green, big, lemony, lots of parmesan, and crunchy. The pizza was made exactly how we ordered it. We loved the thin, chewy crust. I don't feel like it was burned at all. It held the toppings well. Fresh mushrooms, salty kalamata olives, spicy pepperoni, fresh-tasting cheese, sauce that wasn't from a can, and subtle Italian spices makes for a perfect pizza in my opinion. If we stay in the northern Strip area again next time we come I plan on eating here again!"

This is the only Grimaldi's I've been to, so I can only speak for this location, but I enjoy the environment of this Grimaldi's.\n\nMy family and I were seated quickly and greeted friendly by the server. Unlike other pizza places like Sammy's Woodfire Pizza, they only serve pizza and salads, there are no other entrees, so be forewarned. I'm always a big fan of the normal pizzas, but they do have a white pizza that I heard was delicious as well. You order whatever additional toppings you want on your pizza for a certain price per topping on the whole or half of the pizza, adding each topping is the same price for both. In my opinion, the toppings could be a little cheaper since you are paying upwards of $18 for a large pizza and you can easily throw on three toppings and pay $25 for a pizza. The pizza itself is quite delicious though, so it's a nice treat once in a while. The pizzas are thin and can easily fall once you pick it up, so if you need to, use two hands or cut up the beginning portion with a fork until you get about halfway, where it is safe to pick up without falling. Our server that we had was really nice and was helpful to us to make our experience complete and amazing. This wouldn't be my everyday place to eat pizza, but this is a nice place to eat at every once I a while."

Yes, I am right. \n\nThe waitress - I forgot what her name was because her \"service\" sucked balls - was not helpful at all and was very rude.\n\nWhen we first arrived, she never greeted us and was trying to rush us into ordering. Dude! We're not at Pho Kim Long, were at The Palazzo! \n\nAnyways, to start our dinner off, I wanted to order a glass of Sangria and asked our waitress what her recommendation was since I had a choice of a white or red Sangria. She answered me with, \"Well, that depends on what you like. If you like a sweet or sour.\" Ummmm, Chinese food sweet and sour?! Say what? Who? How? Where? When? That...was...helpful?! I guess! I blankly stared at her for a second and kept quiet. It was such an awkward moment, I HAD to just brush it off. You would think that she would at least make up some BS just to show that she was trying to help me but no, she did not. I ended up getting the white Sangria - just because the menu says that it has Moscato in it. Thanks to the menu, it was more helpful than our waitress!

Sometimes, I wonder if the waitress was the one who made the pizza because that pizza was just as bad as her service. \n\nReasons why I did not like the pizza:\n\nStrike 1: The pizza came out warm...almost cold.\nStrike 2: The inner part of the pizza was soggy and VERY watery.\nStrike 3: The pizza sauce was acidic! It was worse that Ragu. Lmao! \n\nOh and to top off the horrible dinner experience, my 12-year-old nephew ordered a personal pizza and it came out last - after everyone had already eaten! WHY?

And they simulate the exact same settings found in NYC. The pH of the water is balanced to the same standards in NYC. The brick oven is also set at 800 degrees and of course the ingredients are comparable found there.\n\nBut this time around, there was no line...granted it was 1am on a random Sunday night, and there were just a few people at the bar and the dining area, and I was hungry so I had to get me some of this fine pizza.\n\nScrew the personal size 12\" pizza. I went for their \"small\" which is 16\". And within 30 minutes I had no problem eating the whole thing. The whole thing...and all by myself.\n\nIt was that good. I'm glad I got to experience it. And of course I would do this again. They have a wine list. You can choose to eat out in the patio, at the bar or in their pretty big dining area."

My favorite part of it was the fresh mozzarella. For the pizza we decided to go with meatballs, sun dried tomatoes, onions, and garlic. The small size was just the right size for the two of us and we even had leftovers. Delicious! I highly recommend getting the meatballs on anything, they were the best part."

We shared a small house salad which was a nice portion for two at $6 plus we added Genoa salami for $2 more. It was as fresh as it could be. We followed that with a meatball and jalapeno medium pizza which was a great size for two. Topping prices were very reasonable..just $2 each. And the mozzarella was fresh instead of the shredded kind. The service was great and fast.We were pleasantly surprised at how affordable this was for a great quality meal in the Palazzo shops. Maybe that's why it wasn't crowded at all. It's kind of tucked away yet really close to the Grand Canal shops in the Venetian. I will definitely try the one in Florida next time we're there."

I have been to the location on Eastern, but this was my first visit to the newish Palazzo location.\n\nWe decided on the large 18in pizza with chicken sausage and mushrooms. Then, ordered a carafe of their house red wine for $15. The wine was not very good on its own, but will likely pair nicely with the pizza.\n\nWhen it arrived, the pizza looked really tasty and couldn't wait to take a bite. I was in pizza heaven with the first taste. The crust was thin and some what chewy. Then, the sweet and somewhat spicy sauce was added to the crust in mindful clusters, no haphazard slopping on of sauce here. The yummy mozzarella was applied in a similar manner. Lastly, the chicken sausage added a delicious meaty and spicy fennel note.\n\nI was right, the marginal carafe wine really paired nicely with the pie by bringing out the spicy fennel and cutting through the cheesy mozzarella.\n\nGrimaldi's, I must confess, your pizza, in my humble opinion, is easily the best in Las Vegas, possibly my favorite of all time. Can't wait for my next visit to pizza nirvana."

The sausage was fantastic and the bubbly, charred crust was one of the highlights. Love that stuff. They also made an Italian Margarita that was delicious and not too sweet. We got there a bit before 5 and had to wait for our pizza because they don't start the oven until 5. But that was a great move because we got a nice table in the patio area. At 5 when the ovens fired up the crowd rolled in quickly. The great salad, antipasto and Margaritas made the wait for the ovens a breeze."

The pizza came out with very thin crust, the fresh mozzarella cheese they use was amazing and probably what made the whole pizza taste as good as it did.\nWe also ordered some white house wine ($4/glass, $9/ half carafe, which is actually pretty big) I would say this is the cheapest alcohol you can find in Vegas.

In fact, it was pretty overstaffed (it was about one server per table), yet we received no service. No worries, I thought, the food will definitely be worth it since there was so much positive feedback! NOT! Disappointed again. First off, its a thin crust pizza, which means it really shouldn't take very long. Took over 40 minutes. It made me wonder how they would be able to handle it if the place was packed. Maybe it is just never packed..... Pizza was sub par. Cheese got rubbery after five minutes. The crust was burnt on many areas. I enjoy a little burn since it is stone oven, but this was excessive. The sausage was good though, but what is the point of a good tasting ingredient if the pizza as a whole tasted like garbage.

I love thin pizzas so if you are not a fan and want more thickness, you may not like it.  They make these pizzas with fresh mozzarella cheese and you can see them make it through their glass windows. Andddd  i must say, this pizza was GINORMOUS!! We had to take 2 slices to go. We also ordered the Antipasto, which consisted of genoa salami, fresh mozzarella, oven-roasted sweet peppers, sicilian olives, and oven toasted crostini.  This was $9 for a regular size.  This was just an okay salad dish.  All this and only one basil leaf? :(  Overall, I love this place.  It is located in Venetian/Palazzo hotel.  Very nice decor and a great place for a date too!

I'd much rather go to the secret pizza place at the Cosmo.\n\nThis is a good place if you want something relatively quick, easy, and affordable."

Isolated by itself near some escalators. When you walk in you are greeted by a hostesses who will bring you to your table.\n\nIts decorated a tad nicer then the Brooklyn location. Service was awesome, our waitress constantly checked in on us.\n\nFood was ok and thats why I gave it the 3 star rating.\n\nRed Sauce Pizza - Crust was better then New York, but the sauce was a tad tangy for my taste.\n\nGarlic Pizza with Mozzerla - this was the star of the show. super flavorful and perfect with sausages.\n\nIt was an ok experience, I still prefer Basic Pizza in San Diego and Napolini over this."

I thought what am I going to do with this pizza?\n\nOne of my other friend's also got a free pizza because theirs was too burnt.\n\nSo 2 free pies to go on my last night there.

Not as good as the cosmo water!\n\nTry this place out if you like flat pizza and free pizza."

Since then I have been trying pizza everywhere I can near where I live in Southern California. I had yet to find anything good, or at least comparable to What I experienced in NYC. Enter Grimaldi's. Another coal fired oven pizza. I had hopes. It was a restaurant from the famed Grimaldis that is still sitting next the Brooklyn bridge. And guess what, this hit the mark. This is damn close to Lombardis, the second best pizza of my life, and a very close send at that. This place is amazing, great atmosphere, great food; the pizza, thin, crispy crust, sweet light sauce, fresh mozzarella, what else could you want?  Tried the Cannolis and they are not bad either. Overall, if you want a great New York Pizza without the commute f going cross country, this is it."

She loved it (ended up getting some at Total Wine after dinner) and I had the house Bloody Mary, which uses pizza sauce instead of tomato juice, and garnished with pepperoni, cherry tomato, basil, and olives, VERY good. We started with Antipasto which was excellent!  For our pizza order, she had the gluten free Margherita, and I had the Margherita minus the basil, add kalamata olives. Now, mind you.. we are becoming pizza snobs, and are now on a mission to try the best of the best in Las Vegas. It will take a LOT to knock this pizza out of the top place, in my books. Not only was the pizza out of this world, the ambience, even being on a busy Friday night was just what we were hoping for. The service we received from Chelsea was impeccable!!!!  She was beyond helpful, and just a real sweetheart!  We will be asking for her every time we go back, without hesitation. I truly cannot think of anything bad to say about this place. To those of you who are saying this pizza wasn't good, it was too thin, it was too this, too that....  I'm telling you right now, Dominos, and Papa Johns..... IS NOT REAL PIZZA!!!!!  Say that over, and over in your head until you start to understand it. \n\nWe finished the evening with dessert, which is something that we NEVER do, and boy am I glad we did!  We shared a piece of butterscotch toffee cheesecake, and it did not disappoint one bit!  Paired that with a cup of amazing cappuccino, and I was one happy, happy man. Now, the food is not terribly cheap, but I have zero problem paying good money for good food, and even better service, and that's just what we got. I've paid more for worse food, and worse service. \n\nIf you happen to read this Chelsea, please know that we thoroughly  enjoyed our night, thanks to you and Grimaldi's. And we will take your advice and come back on a weeknight when it's less busy!  And the little tip about the certain time of day to get the best tasting pizza, we'll keep that to ourselves :-) Thank you again, and we'll see you real soon!"

They tried to charge us for food we didn't get, and after asking to pay for just the drink we did get, when the check was dropped off, we were immediately asked to pay with cash or check when the check was dropped off. Mistakes happen in restaurants, but when it's your mistake, I expect not to be treated like someone who might dine and dash. Especially after almost an hour of being ignored, and then finally asking for a check due to an abundance of honesty. This place SUCKS. Never going back.

Small pizza good enough for three people with average appetites. \n\nLocated in the palazzo hotel near restaurant row on the 2nd level beside table 10. This restaurant has seating for large or small groups. We sat at a table and were quickly introduced the concept of pizzas by the waiter. He was nice but a little rushed. \n\nI ordered the small pizza with fresh roma tomatoes. Pizzas here all come with fresh mozzarella and a tangy sweet sauce. You add the toppings to your liking and each topping has its price. I ordered the small pizza and it was more than enough for two people. Leaving a extra serving for breakfast the next day.  So it would be perfect for 3 people unless you are big eaters. \n\nThe crust was crisp and thin. It did not fall apart when picked up but was slightly burnt on one side of the pizza. I hate charred crust! So minus a star for that. But the best part of the pizza was the sauce. It was sweet and tangy and had a good zip to it. Its not like italys pizza. But its just as good. (The sauce is more sweeter here) and I find authentic pizza emphasizes great ingredients. All of the ingredients on my pie were fresh and tasty. No complaints there. The waiter says the salads are good enough for three people. \n\nOn my particular visit service was a bit haphazard. The waiter provided everything quickly but kinda forgot about my sons juice. But provided it shortly before our meal came. (He was drinking his water bottle before this). It was off season so the restaurant was empty. But I loved the Chandaliers of the palazzo and the open concept brick oven. It was quite a nice space. Overall theres not many quick choices in the palazzo that are affordable and cheap. And a meal for two here is quite reasonable for the strip. $25 for  pie and two drinks. Not bad. My son raved about the pizza saying it was very good!

My table ordered The Don, and it was pretty tasty and packed full of toppings, which is just how I like it. The pizza crust was where things fell off for me a bit, though. The outter crust was burnt and somehow, the crust under the pizza was slight burnt but was still mushy enough you couldn't pick up your slice to eat it, and had to cut it me eat it with a fork instead. The wait staff was fun and kind but pretty disorganized. This is a cute pizza place and I would give it another try sometime in the future if someone suggests it, but for my money, there are better options to look into on The Strip."

The location was easy to find (thanks to the concierge) and around the area are small shopping places. \nRight off the bat the guy took our drink order and even catered to our 10 month old. And by catered I mean water cup with a lid and straw, high chair and even a pizza dough to place with! So the service was awesome (:\nNow the food, we ordered a Caprese & large Caeser Salad, Large Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza and a dessert Trio (you choose which one you want): Baileys cheesecake, Tiramisu and a Canolli.\n First of the Caeser salad was freaking AMAZING! the large was big enough to be shared by four people and have enough to get seconds for everyone. The Caprese was alright, what threw me off is the basil they were using. Either its gone bad and that's why its such a dark green or I've never tasted real basil before. Anyways, the large pizza was more than enough for four people. My mother & father in law were saying that the sausage had a little kick to it so my 5 year old sister in law couldn't/wouldn't eat it. Other than that, I thought it was alright. Never really tasted an \"authentic\" pizza so I don't have much to go off on. Now the dessert ... EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! It's nice that they have an option/bundle to try some dessert with decent portion. \n\n\n***Again, everything we got was more than enough for four people and a toddler."

I suggest that the Grimaldi clan go to Settebello in Green Valley and tast real Neapolitan pizza. \nCrust should be chewy, not hard dammit!\nTake a trip to Napoli, the birthplace of pizza, if you don't believe me.\n\nThe toppings are not in synch with any of the other toppings. It's as if they were chosen on their own with no awareness of how they would ultimately work together.\n\nAnd please! \nThis coal-fired nonsense, and New York water nonsense doesn''t mean anything, except as a marketing ploy to get gullible tourists to think they're eating something special. \n\nIf you want great pizza, go down the street to Sicili's Pizza on Twain. It's in a ghetto area, so I don't advise eating in, but as take-out or delivery, it's amazingly good. And at half the price!!!\n\nBut if you're a lazy tourist who doesn't want to leave the casino, then you're stuck with this mediocre pizza.\n\nIf this represents New York pizza, given the fame of Grimaldi's in New York, I've never been happier not to live in that overcrowded, smelly, cesspool."

I would say it is 3.5 stars. The edge was quite burn, but that happens sometimes. The crust was really good. The cheese was a little strange how it cooked, maybe it was the type of cheese that was on it...not sure. \n\n2. Service - We were seated in the patio area. The bartender was the server for the entire patio area. He seemed stretched a little thin managing both and he seemed to be outside his comfort zone waiting tables. \n\n3. Alcohol/Bar - We did not order alcohol, but the two tables next to us did & this is based on overhearing them. Both tables ordered cocktails & both were unhappy with the quality. They both mentioned it to the server (not aware he was the one who made them) & he awkwardly apologized, but didn't offer to mend the problem in any way. One of the tables ordered a beer that was on tap to supplement the poor tasting cocktail & when the drink arrived, the glass was a little over half full. Based on my ease dropping ;) I would not come here for the alcohol. \n\n4. Cleanliness - The bathroom wreaked of urine. I am pretty sure it is what was all over the floor...yuck. \n\nThis place looks nice, but they just didn't have it together."

I consider myself a pizza snob having had the best ny slices at Lombardi's when I used to live in Manhattan. The crust here is done right. They bake it in a coal oven just like the east coast. Although not environmentally friendly, it brings out the crisp char (but still maintaining the chewiness)  I thought the sauce was zesty and delicious but very stingy with the toppings! How dare you charge $2 for spinach but put in like 2 leaves in there. Also not a fan of the pepperoni as it was too salty. The service was extremely slow and we sat there for 30 minutes before our waiter told us that they ran out of sausage. Would I go back though? Yes! As it's very hard to get a good slice on the west coast and Grimaldi's still holds true to their roots."

Not too soggy, not too crispy but just right. The ingredients tasted fresh and it's not too greasy either. On top of everything, THE PRICE is awesome. My friend and I ordered an 18incher (we ate the whole thing)for less than 20 dollars.  With the extra toppings that we ordered it came to a little over 20 but that's still cheaper than Papa John's. \n\nThe ENVIRONMENT is pretty huge with a NY style of decor.  They have a standard bar and dine in area towards the back. \n\nThe SERVICE was good, however we did go at a pretty slow time.

            "review": "Last night, on my last review I shared my experience at a pizzeria that was ordinary at best. For this review I will leave Paris for Italy to share a pizzeria that makes me say, \"wow!\" Being this is the Las Vegas Strip, the distance from Paris to Italy is less than a mile. \n\n    Grimaldi's is a pizzeria chain that started in New York City. There original location is off Fulton Street under the Brooklyn Bridge (this place fits would fit in at NY-NY). Grimaldi's became so popular that it spread to different parts of the country. There are a few locations in Las Vegas. The neat thing about Grimaldi's is that their two locations on the Las Vegas Strip (the other one is in Fashion Show) are identical to the off-strip locations. Disparate from certain restaurants, Grimaldi's has stayed off the price - gouging bandwagon. Another neat thing is that I personally visited the original location. Well kind of. On the way to Atlantic City, my friend pulled up to Grimaldi's and took out a pie that was delicious road food on the drive. A few other times, he'd take out Grimaldi's. The fact that he lived in the middle of Long Island, a landscape where the pizzeria is the equivalent of the poker lounge in Vegas, and stopped at Grimaldi's when he was in the City is evidence that Grimaldi's is first-rate pizzeria. From these experiences, I attest to the fact that Grimaldi's is legitimate New York pizza instead of a pizzeria pretending to be. \n\n   Practically across the continent and a long ride across Interstate 15 and 80 to the George Washington Bridge this Grimaldi's sits in the shadow of canals, gondola boats, and St. Mark's Square. Just like the Brooklyn Bridge, this makes for an exciting spot to enjoy New York pizza that melts in your mouth and not in your hands. \n\n   The restaurant itself is impressive. It is a large space on the upper floor of the Palazzo Shops a coin throw from the pedestrian bridge leading to the Wynn. The upscale environment is a relaxing location to bite into New York pizza while listening to a soundtrack including Frank Sinatra. The impressive dining space extends from a patio overlooking the Palazzo Shops to Las Vegas Boulevard. There are several tables with red and white table cloths plus a bar underneath the dimly lit pizzeria. Many of the tables offer a unique Vista of the colossal chandelier hanging from the Palazzo Shops ceiling forming a wall at the restaurant elevation. Talk about elegance. Now I will talk about the pizza. \n\n    I respect Grimaldi's for having the decency to pass over taking advantage of being on the Las Vegas Strip. The prices are commendable. A small New York pizza pie featuring the coal oven cooked thin crust, melting mozzarella cheese, and out of this world Grimaldi's sauce is $9 before toppings. The menu offers a sundry of toppings including meatballs, pepperoni, bacon, and other choices. I cherish my pizza pie with mushrooms. The mushrooms, in similar style to numerous toppings adds $2 to the experience. And what an experience! Prior to the pizza pie, bread and butter is a tasty oman to meal ahead. With the pizza pie, I order a soda. After tip and tax, it comes out to less than $20 well spent. \n\n   At Grimaldi's, the staff is just like the pizza: pleasant. The servers have always been attentive and friendly. One of the servers I had for a few visits was extraordinary friendly. I remember asking him if they are opening anymore Grimaldi's. He enthusiastically said that they want to build one in northwest Las Vegas. That was a couple of years ago and has yet to happen. What does happen is that you feel appreciated here. \n\n   This review is a word picture that tells a true story that there is usually a Happy Ending dining at the Palazzo Grimaldi's. This positive word picture is one of the positive Grimaldi's accolades. The Food Network rated it as one of the five best pizzerias in the United States. Ziglats rated it as the best pizzeria in New York City. I will finish painting this word picture by saying that I recommend Grimaldi's."

Add desired toppings (about $2 each)\nWe added pepperoni, sausage, and ham: $6\n\nTOTAL COST: \n$24 for a HUGE pizza which made for 8 slices and 4 happy people. \n\nI'm not much of a pizza person, I'll eat the toppings/cheese, the crust and then throw the rest away (I know... such a waste) but I think the dough to toppings ratio is way too much for most pizzas.

Prior to the pizza, we also split a tomato mozzarella salad. This was good (hard to get that salad too wrong) and we both left the meal feeling full. They don't have Coke products, so while I would have liked a nice Diet Coke with my meal, I stuck with water. It's set away from the casino noise, which was nice, and certainly gives you ample portions."

The made to order part is outstanding, but, it always seems to take way longer than it should to prepare a pizza. The service, while friendly, has also always been a bit too casual and not entirely focused on the service part.  Now, we have only ever ordered from them late in the evening (Go figure, late night pizza in Vegas! Shocking!), so they're probably thinking about closing duties, but still.  The bar area where you order and wait maybe seats 7 people' it shouldn't be that hard to get some more water or order another beer.\n\nThe other thing that really prevents me from going up another star is the pricing.  It just seems absurd to pay anywhere from $2-$4 for toppings, on top of a small pizza already being $14.  Some of the pricing also just seems weird; sausage is $2 but jalapenos are $4? A jalapeno that is, at most, $1.00 in the store (if it's organic!)? \n\nJim G. and I aren't even supposed to be eating these carbs, so this shouldn't even be an issue.  I hope, for my own sake, that I don't get sucked in to eating this too many more times.  However, when I do, at least I know that the pizza will be fresh and it will be good.

It'll mess with your palate otherwise. \n\nEither way I think I'll have pizza now!\n\nGrimalids in El Segundo, CA here I come!\n\nHere's to 5 star ratings that are truly worthy of much applause!\n\nHappy Eats Yelpers!"

There's a solid amount of choices you can make when it comes to ordering your pizza. White Sauce, Red Sauce, Garlic, etc... Plenty of different toppings that are authentic and taste amazing. I personally enjoyed the Large Red with Pepperoni and Mushrooms.\n\nService: Pretty standard. Waitresses were quick and friendly, didn't really have a problem with them.\n\nAtmosphere: Legitly decorated. Feels like a nice pizza place due to it's old-school photographs and table setting. Loved it.\n\nPrice: Between the 8 guys that went there, we paid around $10-12 each for a total of 3 Large pizzas. For Vegas that's pretty good especially when you're eating specialty food!\n\nOverall Opinion: I thought this place was pretty up to par, but honestly nothing stood out enough for me to fall in love with this place. The food is great, the service was good, the atmosphere was nice, but nothing was there that screamed out \"I GOTTA COME BACK FOR THIS\"."

I can't imagine a better day... can you? \n\nAcross the way we found this pizza joint where they do NY Style pies and ordered a white pie with plenty of garlic. We added and it came with big chunks of bacon, black olives and artichokes-the small was PLENTY for two people with a slice left over so no need to spend more than that if you're just dining with a pal. \n\nThey had a peanut butter cup cheesecake on the menu that we just barely made it out alive without. We were so tempted but so full from the pizza. Next time, that cheesecake won't be so lucky. \n\nThey serve Diet Pepsi if you drink that junk- The cousin does much to my scolding and was delighted-as everywhere else we had been all weekend was Coke. \n\nWe sat at the bar which was chill and comfy and the place was totally dead between 3 and 5 when we were there in the off afternoon hours. A nice place with good eats to stop if you need a casual bite but don't want to eat and walk."

Unfortunately there was a mishap while the pizza was being served, and my husband ended up wearing a slice of pizza. The staff took care of us in a kind and professional way both before and after the flying slice of pizza. Our pizza was delicious, and our service was friendly and efficient. The crust had the perfect amount of char from the coal oven, and the toppings were plentiful and flavorful. I'm not usually a fan of meatballs, but the meatballs on this pizza were exceptionally good, and generous in size.  We also ordered the caramel coconut cheesecake for dessert, which was delicious. Creamy, fresh,and very flavorful.  I would definitely return to this restaurant, and will likely seek out their Arizona counterpart when I return home."

And while I can't comment on whether the Las Vegas location is exactly the same as the one in New York, from what I can tell, I think Grimaldi's is much better than Lombardi's.\n\nNow I'm a deep dish pizza kind of girl. Not that I hate thin crust, but I do not prefer it. Grimaldi's was still excellent in my eyes, and I would definitely come back given the option on a future Vegas trip. I really enjoyed the sausage as a topping, but I would stay away from the bacon, as it's a bit too salty. \n\nKeep in mind when you come here that this is New York style pizza. It's thin crust, it's simple. I'm thinking that maybe some of the negative reviews here are grounded on unmatched expectations due to unfair or unrealistic standards. \n\nFour girls split a large pizza and a large salad. Just the right amount of food.\n\nOh, keep in mind, if you want to do half-half on your pizza and have a certain topping on only half of your pizza, they will still charge you as if you had that topping on your ENTIRE pizza. In other words, if mushrooms cost \"X\" amount of dollars as a topping for your whole pizza, they will still charge you \"X\" amount of dollars to get mushrooms on only half your pizza. Kinda lame.\n\nInside decor was nice as well, with New York subway pictures and signs.\n\nLocated up on the second floor in the Grand Canal Shoppes! You might have to ask around for directions, since it wasn't on the maps yet when I was there."

The location at the Palazzo has a great staff and the food is always very good.  The restaurant is very open and spacious and they don't jam the tables together. They go above and beyond to make sure you are enjoying the dining experience.  \n\nI always enjoy the annual birthday large one topping pizza. I also like how they offer to serve you your first slice of pizza.  Their desserts are awesome and homemade.  The entire staff seems to be entire is staff is super friendly and engaging.\n\nThe bottom line is Grimaldi's provides great food and atmosphere at a reasonable price."

We got started with a personal size pesto pizza with meatballs and mushrooms and a small pizza with pepperoni and italian sausage. Trust me when I say the small isn't really small. Very tempted to order the pizza of the month, the prosciutto pizza, but I can't say no to pesto. Pizzas were just as good as I remembered. Our server Ty was awesome, making sure we were okay and keeping our drinks filled. I made sure to leave room for dessert, so an order for the Bailey Irish Creme Cheesecake was placed. I can't believe I didn't know they had dessert available. It's definitely not on the menu online! Very decadent and yummy! \n\nThis place is just as good as the NY original and I'm stoked they have a location in SoCal (El Segundo!).

Three of their large pizzas, each with multiple toppings, only ran us about $70. That's crazy - it's a ton of food, fed 7 with some left over, and during the opening weekend of the NCAA tournament, it was a great way to lounge in the room and get fat while screaming at the television. Just too bad it's a bit of a walk from the Venetian and Venezia towers.\n\nWe had a pepperoni and mushroom, an Italian sausage and roasted red pepper, and a white pizza with pesto. All were good, with chewy crust and plentiful toppings. I liked their red sauce, and the white pizza was good, although heavy on the garlic. They did list garlic specifically, so I'm not blaming them, but it's not my thing, as you may or may not know.\n\nSo if you need a take out meal to eat in the room?

The thin crust was crunchy but you can still taste the dough. Sauce was not greasy and salty, it makes the pizza a little watery but overall was great. You can really taste the flavor of the pizza. If you want to relax and stay in your room. Just call and order for take out like we did :), you will enjoy it for sure."

The pizza here is Uh-mazing! \n\nWe had a great server who very honest from the get-go, which I always appreciate! It was my husband and I the first night and he said most parties of two can share a small salad and small pizza - definitely true! \n\nWe ordered the Mediterranean small salad - super fresh and customized a small pizza with: artichoke hearts, jalape\u00f1os, black olives and bacon  Fyi - the toppings range from $2 - $3 each on top of the $14 price for a small pizza, but it was worth it! \n\nReturned for salads at lunch yesterday and may hit this up once more for pizza before we leave tomorrow! Will definitely return whenever I'm in Vegas :)"

Go to 800degrees for a 100 times better quality original neapolitean pizza and it's even cheaper.\n\nThis is my 3rd time at Grimaldi over the past year (i sadly went twice in the mall and once in the palazzo location). Even the soda each time was 99% ice and a sip of coke, it was like drinking flavored water. Please don't make my same mistake and tell them NO ICE if you want to have a taste of soda.\n\nThe tomato sauce it is flavorless, so you will see people adding salt like crazy to try to revive a cardboard tasting pizza. The cheese taste like rubber, flavorless as well. The dough is bad but not as bad as the tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. \n\nDo not believe brick oven and this gimmick terminology they use. Brick oven means the oven is made with brick, it doesn't mean wood burning oven. So basically brick oven doesn't mean anything.\n\nOne last issue is that for some reason the pizza has been each time barely warm and after you eat the second slice the rest of the pizza will be cold. Just be prepared.\n\nEvent the secret pizza at the Cosmopolitan and the pizza at the Aria is better! I personally don't like either of them but compared to Grimaldi they are great.

Authenticity is something I'll leave t the experts to debate.   \n\nThey do not serve slices here, but they do make an individual pizza for about $9.00 that's big enough for two if neither is super hungry.  \n\nRegardless of the size, you can select from a lengthy list of toppings - some traditional ones and some fussier ones if you're wanting to get your gourmet on.  \n\nIn addition to pizza, they also have starter and entree salads.  I had a starter spinach salad for about $8.00 that was quite good if perhaps a little heavy on the dressing.  Believe me, the starter salads are very generously portioned, and two could easily split one, especially if you are getting pizza, too.  \n\nThe service was excellent.  \n\nIt's also a comfortable restaurant with a stylish decor and a chill vibe.  \n\nMy buddy and I walked over from the Wynn, and we both thought it was worth the stroll to get there.\n\nBottom line:  a nice place to eat with good food, excellent service, and very reasonable prices."

It had weird blobs of something unattractive (not sure if it was the sauce or the garlic we got on the pizza) that made it difficult to want to eat the whole pizza. The cheese seemed of relatively low quality and the sauce was literally flavorless.

We stayed at the Venetian, so finding our way to Grimaldi's at the Palazzo was pretty simple.  The atmosphere was bright, cheerful and home-style.  The pizza crust was exceptional the first trip, and a little soggy in the center the second.  The sauce was really nice and tangy the first trip and notably sweeter the second.  One constant was the exceptional service from the front of the house hostess (s) to the waitstaff Britt and Marcus to the guys working the dough and oven to the manager (I'm thinking) who peppered our dinner salads.  Smiling faces all around means happy employees which mean happy diners.  I've owned my business long enough to know when you have great people working for you it shows and they are so rare these days.  Britt for instance was exceptionally welcoming, friendly, accommodating and could easily make a bundle at any 5 Star restaurant in the world...I hope folks realize that when you're served like you're family, you should tip accordingly so.  \n\nNow onto the menu, we shared the Spinach Salad and the Don both times and they were great.  We even split a \"personal size\" Don the second trip just so we could save room for tiramisu, but that wasn't happening.  The meatball sausages on the pizza and the real bacon bits in the salad filled this big eater and his wife up easily.\n\nWe'll be back when we stay at the Wynn this summer.  We'll also try Grimaldi's in NYC next month and see if \"the water\" really makes a diff.  This is good pizza and an even better place to eat because of the exceptional hospitality and healthy doses of smiles."

Yelp says, \"Grimaldi's.\"  Hmmm, do I try the place at the Aria (Five50) or give Grimaldi's another shot?  The Yelp reviews for Grimaldi's were too good to dismiss (and it was just across the street at the Palazzo).  Okay Grimaldi's, don't let me down.  Let's get right to the details...very nice atmosphere, outstanding pizza and excellent service!  Our waiter, Victor was amazing!  He recommended the pie, served us with a smile, was efficient, professional and just a very nice person.  Oh yeah, the meatball, ricotta and sweet red pepper pizza was out of this world!

I think the first time I went, we ordered mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and ricotta on our pizza. The second time we ordered basil, sun dried tomatoes, and sausage. Both times the pizza wasn't too oily or too cheesy, and the chewy sun dried tomatoes gave the texture an extra kick.

I'm not sure how this compares to the original, but it's certainly one of the best pizza places now in Las Vegas. It's not the best or the cheapest pizzas I've ever eaten but it's probably one of the better pizzas I've eaten in Vegas (even sober, because yes, even cardboard, oily pizza tastes great at 4 am when you're drunk). It's on the expensive side and probably 50-70% more expensive than you should really be paying for pizza, but that's usually how it goes in Vegas.\n\nI was sad that The Pizza Spot @ The Wynn closed, but this is way better and less greasy with a better selection of toppings. I've also eaten at the Secret Pizza spot (at the Cosmo), which is also good, especially if you only want a single slice, but it's definitely greasier and has limited toppings.\n\nThis is tucked away upstairs in the Palazzo and wasn't crowded at all when I came on a Sunday evening at 6 pm. I had a hard time deciding what to order as there were too many combinations of toppings to pick from (around 20: pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, extra basil) and 3 different sauces - the traditional tomato sauce, white garlic sauce, or pesto. I asked the server what was popular or good, and he was not very helpful (telling me he disliked garlic and that I had to decide on my own).\n\nThe way they price the pizza and toppings is odd. The personal pizza, 12 inches, is $9 for the base (just dough, tomato and cheese), and the small pizza is 16 inches and $14, and the large is 18 inches and $16. I don't know why they don't have a medium size, or why they didn't just make a small, medium and large - probably so the people dining solo didn't feel awkward for ordering an entire \"small\" pizza for just themselves. If you want the white with garlic, add on $1 or $2 depending on the size of the pizza. The price of the toppings is odd, either $2 (mushrooms, garlic, olives, spinach, ham, extra cheese, extra basil, italian sausage, meatballs) or $4 (sausage, sun dried tomatoes). I don't know why extra basil is the same price as italian sausage, why garlic or jalape\u00f1os are $2 each, and why sun-dried tomatoes are $4. Just close your eyes, order and know that your bill (like everything else in Vegas) will be expensive.\n\nI got the italian sausage and mushroom personal pizza. I could have done with just half the pizza, but ended up eating it all (I figured I already had done a number on my body in Vegas, so why not just continue the bad decisions). The crust was delicious and thin, and not burnt. The tomato sauce was the right amount and it was not overly cheesy (the cheese also seemed fresh and high-quality), nor did they skimp on the toppings. All in all, once I started eating, I couldn't stop - it was delicious.\n\nIt wasn't the fastest pizza - from the time I ordered to when I got the pizza, it was probably 30 min or so. It was on the expensive side ($17 for a small pizza), but not outrageously priced for Vegas, and it was one of the better pizzas I've had in Vegas. I'll definitely be back here next time I stay at Wynn or Encore and need some carbs to soak up the alcohol or a fairly-inexpensive casual meal. Come with at least 2 people so you don't have to eat an entire pizza by yourself.\n\nYou can also order pizza and pick it up, which is a nice option if you are too hungover to leave your room and have a nice friend who will come pick it up for you."

            "review": "My first time at Grimaldi's ever, and it was terrible. First, the place wasn't really that busy, but my husband and I were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. 20 minutes later, we were seated. After taking our drink order, it took our waiter about another 20 minutes to get my one glass of wine to me. For dinner, we ordered one large pizza to share and a small salad for me. After 30 minutes, the waiter stopped by for the first time since dropping my wine off to get my husband's Pepsi refill, at which point he mentioned my salad to the waiter. He looked at his notepad, and replied with \"Oh, that's right. Sorry about that, I'll be right back.\" He completely forgot about it. About 10 minutes later, the waiter came to us to tell us the kitchen staff burned our pizza, so we'd have to wait another 10-15 minutes to allow them to finish the second pizza. My salad was better than the pizza. I don't know what all the hype is because I've had better frozen pizzas than what they made. To top it all off, it was half-price Tuesday, and we were charged full price for my glass of wine. My second worst restaurant service experience of all time."

It took a long while for our server to acknowledge us and she was running like mad. Meanwhile, tables that arrived after us were starting to receive their drinks and salads, etc. Each brief, frenzied contact with our server gave the impression that we were inconveniencing her. Last straw? As we finally got ready to place our pizza order, she literally turned to another table. We literally got up and left. \n\nNo one's pizza is *that* good."

I went to use the bathroom only to find there was no handsoap. Notified them and proceeded to wait for someone to address the matter so I could wash my hands. During this time I watched 2 male employees use the men's rest room and return to the kitchen. How do you wash your hands properly without any hand soap? Got tired of waiting so got soap from the ladies room which was unoccupied and returned to the men's room to finish washing my hands. Confirmed the soap was still not refilled. I was quite turned off by this and reluctant to eat the pizza but didn't want to ruin everyone else's lunch. Kudos to our server for doing his best to compensate but the manager is doing a terrible job running this place. Family seemed to be quite pleased with the pizza but having seen what I saw...eat at your own risk. Sanitary food prep is apparently not a high priority at this place. Lastly, avoid the sangria. Sad excuse for sangria it was given that it's white wine with lemon and orange slices mixed w/sprite. Go to Canonita for real sangria that actually uses real fruit!"

Classic 1200 degree coal burning ovens, formulated water with identical pH and mineral content of NYC water (not sure if this is a good thing).  All leads to what is undoubtedly one of the best NYC style pizza crust.  It's blistered,  well seasoned, just the right thinness with the perfect chew, with the perfect hint of smoky bitterness.  \n\nDirt cheap for the Strip.  $9 for a personal 12\" red sauce pie $10 for a garlic white sauce or pesto.  Add $2 per topping including some great spiced meatballs, sweet Italian Sausage (American style), tender oven roasted peppers and milky mozzarella.  Mild intensity to any of the sauces to let the toppings show through.\n\nCalzones are excellent.  Same great dough as the pies, same great filling in a hand held pouch.\n\nTrue NYC pizzeria feel with the manager, hostess, and bartenders loudly shooting the breeze right at the door (when it's not too busy).  \n\nA well chosen  selection of wines focusing on Italy, most offered by the glass or half carafe (500ml or 2/3 of a whole bottle).  Reasonable prices.  Half off all wines on Tuesdays.\n\nA welcome, affordable addition to the Palazzo."

They were good salads for the money but I recommend passing on them and saving room for a pizza. \n\nWe got one large for three men and it was plenty. There were 8 slices so one guy gets screwed and only gets two pieces so make sure to eat fast! \n\nIf you are the unlucky one don't worry. There are plenty of good desserts on the menu to top you off. We got the cheesecake which was very delicious. \n\nService was fast and courteous.

In fact, I was surprised to find that the menu didn't even provide any suggestions for topping combinations.  Just a choice of regular, white, or pesto base, and a list of run-of-the-mill ingredients such as pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, etc.\n\nBut don't let the simplicity of the menu fool you.  The crust was thin and impossibly crispy, with no hint of getting limp as we bore through the 12\" pizza.  The sauce packed a pleasant tangy punch.  The pepperoni was thick, chock full of flavor, all around excellent.  The italian sausage was pleasant, and our mushrooms remained fat and tender despite the coal oven. \n\nGrimaldi's wins you over with fresh, high quality ingredients - no frills or fluff.  It has definitely upped my pizza game, and I can only hope Grimaldi's finds its way to the Washington DC area!"

Not only did our food take forever, parties that seated after us received their food and requests before us, no one checked on us and even the food runner gave us attitude. We had empty cups and had to flag down service. What was really appalling was they had my mom get out of her seat and stand there while new customers walked through past our table. There was obviously not enough walking room since the tables were too close together on that side, but alternatively the hostess could have walked the customers around our table on the side with a wider pathway. So inconvenient and inconsiderate. \n\nWe were so so upset and management didn't provide anything to make us feel better about the situation. Zero tip."

Upon biting in it tasted even better then it looked. You can tell it was fresh made straight from the oven. the crust had a nice crunch on the outside yet soft more fully inside texture.

Very tasty and good upon the first bite! We asked for the garlic powder and added to our pizza which made it taste a little better, but the garlic powder wasn't as strong as what we had in NY. I have to agree that the pizza was delicious, but it wasn't as good as what we had in Brooklyn's for some reason. It took about 20minutes for the pizza to come out. We also ordered a personal size pizza with white sauce. I didn't taste it but my friends did and agreed it wasn't as good as the regular pizza. \n\nThe service was okay, the server could put a smile on his face at least. I heard the less toppings you put, the better. Don't overload your pizza! I recommend regular pizza with tomato sauce with basil. A side story: my bf left his credit card here but they were kind enough to keep it until we picked it up. Thanks! 4 stars for excellent pizza and no wait!

The sauce is a bit too sweet; it actually drowns out the flavor of your toppings and makes everything taste the same."

Great cannolis. \n\nThe location was super quiet when we were there (early dinnertime). At the back of the ultra-upscale Shops at the Palazzo, I'm guessing that this pizza joint isn't often busy.

Also had a bite of the regular pepperoni with mushroom and sausage, which was delicious too. The bacon topping was a bit too salty for my taste, but a lot of my friends seemed to enjoy that too. If you like thin crust, NY style pizza, this place delivers.\n\nHowever, minus two stars for the service. The server didn't do much in terms of taking our order. We were left alone for a while, so one of my girlfriends took initiative and just started writing down our orders with pen and paper. We literally just handed the server our pre-written orders. Lame. Second, when it was time for clean up, the server was trying to dump half eaten pizza crusts on a bigger plate. Large pieces of crusts started falling off his precariously balanced plates right in front of me, but he didn't stop or say sorry. He simply picked up the dropped crusts and started dumping more on top of his growing pile. Eventually, large pieces of half-eaten crusts were falling ON MY LAP. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?! It wasn't until I said, \"Can you please stop that now?\" that he did. No apologies. Just left.\n\nAs someone who grew up working in a restaurant, this was 1) disgusting and 2) rude.  Yes, sometimes you drop things when clearing the tables. Yes, sometimes accidents happen. But you always give a courtesy \"sorry\" to the customer if you're dropping shit everywhere, and you STOP if your hands are getting too full. Come back a second time so you don't drop food ON TOP OF THE CUSTOMER. \n\nI'd even cut them some slack it was super busy and the servers were running around, but there were no more than 5-6 tables at the time being served. Awful. I wish I could have given this place 5 stars because we really did enjoy the pizza. The service though? 1 star."

Upon arriving in Vegas, this was the first place we hit up, less than an hour after they opened. \n\nThe hostess was quick to meet us and sat us outside in the main shopping area. I was hesitant at first because I didn't want the feel of being a zoo animal in an exhibit. \n\nMy friend ordered the classic Margherita pizza while I ordered the plain pesto pizza.\n\nKnowing that they freshly make their pizzas, we waited patiently and were more than thrilled with the pizzas arrived. Shortly after we got our food, there was a holiday special performance with Santa and his dancing elves. This attracted a lot of attention throughout the mall, and hence, made me feel like the zoo animal I feared I'd become.\n\nPeople would walk by, pointing at what we were eating. And to add brownie points? Close to the end of the holiday performance, 'fake snow' started falling from the ceiling of the shopping center, so we got the complimentary topping of soap suds on our pizza.\n\nThis was the reason this review is 3 stars, not 4 or 5. I felt my experience was really ruined as a result of the special performance and eating outside in the shopping area.\n\nTIPS:\n1. Don't eat here on the weekends in December.\n2. Eat inside if you can, don't sit out in the shopping area.\n3. Order the pesto - it's yummy.\n\nOverall, the pizza was tasty. I love NY style pizza [I actually love all forms of pizza - i don't discriminate]. Grimaldi's knows how to impress with their pies - too bad the locale was not as impressive.\n\nStaff is friendly - moderately attentive with the water. Just when I thought our server forgot us, he would show up. Not sure I'd come back since Vegas is full of great places to feast at, but definitely won't pass it up if Grimaldi's came up in culinary consideration conversation."

From it's original location under the Brooklyn Bridge (which I've been to), this New Yorker ain't gonna take no guff from some high end mega resort.  They are running the show and this isn't a diluted Grimaldi's Pizza, it's the real deal.  \n\nLocated in the Shoppes at the Palazzo, now you don't have to venture off the strip for a Grimaldi's pizza (if you don't want to).  Prices actually seemed to be pretty close to other Grimaldi's locations.  Not to say this is a cheap pie, you get what you pay for and adding toppings gets expensive quick.  Problem is they are all so good, it's hard to not add them.  Went with Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, Mushroom, Onion, Roasted Sweet Red Peppers, and fresh Basil.  My biggest complaint with Grimaldi's has always been the basil.  It just gets charred up in the coal fired oven and you lose the flavor of it as it's replaced with a burnt taste.  Lombardi's Pizza in New York adds the basil after the pie is cooked, so this time I had Grimaldi's do that and I liked it a lot better.  Perhaps there was too much basil on the pie and it would have been better shredded a little finer, but it still was a nice topping, and I recommend you order it that way.  Also don't dismiss the meatballs as a topping, they are really good and have lots of flavor.  The pepperoni and sausage provided some spice.  The cheese is fresh mozzarella and very rich.  I can assure you this will be one of the best pies you've had.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=XqdLYxc2ln60eNNNZ4NOmw#XqdLYxc2ln60eNNNZ4NOmw\n\nWe also were very happy with our Caesar Salad.  Nothing super special, but tasty.  It's easy to go meal after meal in Vegas realizing you haven't eaten anything green in a while.  We ordered the large and it was plenty enough for 4 adults to share.  Considering how good their dough is, I'm very interested in trying a calzone on another trip.  Saw a few people eating them and they looked to be a good size.\n\nIf you are staying at the Palazzo, Grimaldi's will be hard to avoid since you will keep getting wafts of pizza in the hallways and elevators as people get it to go and head up to their rooms."

It is essentially an $18 coupon for a large pizza! \n\nThis essentially gets you a large one topping, or a large white with garlic, and you pay for additional toppings or anything else above and beyond!\n\nI enjoy Grimaldi's charcoal style ovens, which add a nice flavor to the super thin crust and toppings. The pepperoni and sausage combo was a bit on the greasy end, but a little grease is a good thing!  The white pizza is amazing, with chunks of garlic hiding in there!\n\nI'll be back at some point, but for sure next year for my birthday!"

Only 3 tables in use in the restaurant.  It took over an hour to get one pizza and we never had a chance to order more drinks because nobody ever came to check on us.  When I asked about our order the manager apologized and the pizza was out in 10 minutes.... About the time it takes to make and bake a pizza. Still didn't see out waiter until he dropped the check at the end without so much as an apology. The pizza was amazing. The best pizza and worst service I have ever had. \n\nI went back about a week later on my last night in vegas with a coworker. I explained my previous experience with the service and this time was much better.  The next morning I woke up to head to the airport for my flight and the tell tale signs of food poisoning reared their ugly head. Flying with food poisoning is one of the worst experiences I have ever had.  I am 100% sure of the source of the food poisoning as I only ate one thing on that day... Grimaldis pizza with a caprese salad. The salad is likely to be the culprit but to have two horrible experiences in a 2 week time period is inexcusable. I suggest avoiding this spot at all costs."

And then we are talking to the young lady that seated us and she tells me that they change the coal in the oven twice a day.   How much more authentic and how much more can you care about your customers than that?\n\nAbsolutely outstanding place.  Loved their location (Palazzo Shoppes, LV Blvd. entrance), decor (light fixtures made from wine bottles), ambience, service and, most of all, their pizza. You walk in, are pleasantly welcomed and taken down a long hallway, passing smaller tables of patrons, to the main dining area. Ordered a small pizza with ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes.  SOOO good!!  In fact, I love this place so much more than the Brooklyn location, though there is something to be said for standing on the sidewalk waiting to get in at the original.  And I thought the pizza was just better. Mabel was just a very pleasant, smiling and attentive waitress and was very patient with my wife's undecisiveness.\n\nYou can actually stand there and watch them make the pizza and shove it into the brick oven with their long pizza paddles, all burned and crusted.  Quite cool.\n\nWe also ordered a small dinner salad (that wasn't so small) with a dressing that was excellent.\n\nWe topped it all off with a superb Tiramisu.  Dang, that thing was good!\n\nThe only other pizza that I believe we like just as much or more is from Bottega Louie in downtown Los Angeles.  Either way, you can't go wrong.\n\nIf there was only one thing I didn't care for, was the price of the toppings. Four bucks each to add the artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes.\n\nBTW, they didn't take reservations for only two, so they told us to just walk right up and check in.  We got there around 6:30pm, perfect timing.\n\nI shall be back.  Vegas, baby!!!"

Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a welcome addition to the strip, with its affordable prices and authentic pizza pies you can't go wrong!  They have a simple menu and a great ambiance, it looks like a little slice of NY (but cleaner) right here in Vegas.  The menu is basically the toppings that you can choose from as well as the sauce (try not to go over 3 items on the pizza cause then the crust gets a little soggy), then they have a couple salads and of course cannolis and dessert to round out the menu for good measure.  Now the desserts/cannolis are really good, the salads, leave a bit to be desired.  The service that I have personally received has been pretty good, and of course the pizza itself is great!  So stop by and try out a few different types of pizza if you have a chance, and if you happen not to like it, guess what fuggetaboutit!"

I chose the personal pizza with ricotta cheese and mushrooms. It was DE. LI. CIOUS.

Our server told us that the \"small\" portion is meant for 2 and the \"large\" portion is meant for 4.\n\nI REALLY don't like the ordering options, which is why I took away one star. All pizzas come with only sauce and cheese, and each topping is an additional cost.

And I prefer NYC pizza over Chicago, Neapolitan, etc. \n\nBut Grimaldi's Pizza left such an impact on my taste buds. It was a combination of the fresh sauce, fresh ricotta, tomato and basil. The sauce especially... It wasn't heavy and pasty, it was fresh, tomato-ie and light. The coal fired pie was thin but cooked to perfection. But the sauce! It totally made the pizza. The only drawback was my wife and I ordered a small to share... And I wanted more \n\nPlease come to the San Gabriel Valley- Ca!"

My husband and I just arrived and were tired and hungry so this seemed easy.\n\nI was relieved that there was no wait for two people. The restaurant on a Sunday evening around 8 was bustling but not too crowded. We were seated promptly on their little \"patio.\" \n\nTo start, we ordered a 1/2 carafe of one of the Sangiovese wines and a Mediterranean salad. We asked for the large, but the waitress helpfully told us that a small salad was enough for two people so we got that, then placed an order for a personal size Margherita pizza. \n\nWine- it was okay. I'm not a connoisseur by any means but I've had wines that I prefer to this one. Still, it did the trick after a long day of driving! $18 for the half carafe, which was about two and half glasses. Since one glass was $7, I'm not entirely sure how good a deal that was.\n\nMediterranean salad- ~$6. romaine lettuce, kalamata olives, feta cheese, tomato, cucumber, and red onion with some type of vinaigrette on top. The small was sufficient although we probably could have finished a large. This was average; the dressing was kind of bland, the lettuce not great and the pieces of feta were pretty small. \n\nMargherita pizza- $12. I enjoyed the pizza overall; both the sauce and crust were well seasoned. The thin crust was nice except that it unevenly cooked. One side was burned while the other side was almost underdone. So...points off for that. \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. I didn't regret choosing Grimaldi's but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my to eat there again."

When I saw there was a location in LV, I knew I had to check it out! \n\nFirst, the place is hard to find! It's all the way in the back corner of the Shops of the Palazzio. It's not a place you can stumble upon.. you have to go actively looking for it. We came for lunch on a Sunday and the place was empty. The atmosphere is great, space is ample and relatively clean-- great place for larger parties. The service was excellent. Our waitress was friendly and very thorough when taking our order. \n\nThe pizza was ok, not as amazing as I expected it to be. The tomato sauce was watered down and the pizza crust was really soggy, making it really hard to eat. The calzones on the other hand were delicious-- stuffed with toppings w/ a side of marinara for dipping. \n\nNot sure if I'll be back, as it's not in the most convent location and the pizza is eh ok. I'm a huge pizza nut though, so if I don't find a better pizza joint on the strip, I'll be more than willing to give Grimaldi's a second try."

That being said, I am surprised at how many places provide gluten free pizza...but I don't expect it. I try to avoid being a pain in the you know what to servers so I generally call ahead or just avoid these places, but this night we had no choice so I expected to graze from the salad bar. \n\nNow the skinny- We get there and I inform the server I'm gluten intolerant and ask if the salad dressings are gluten free. He simply responded- we don't have a gluten free menu. I acknowledge this and asked again if he could just have the kitchen check the back of their salad dressings to ensure they don't have gluten I'd be happy with their salad choices. He just repeated himself that they didn't have a gluten free menu and asked to take the orders of the other people at the table. I was so offended but at the same time I feel bad about my allergy so I just decided I wouldn't eat anything that night. \n\nHad it not been for my friend who went up to the hostess and asked her to please make sure their balsamic was gluten free I'd have not eaten. I was able to have this so I ordered the Mediterranean salad with no dressing and my boyfriend and I shared this with oil and balsamic. My only compliment about this salad was that it was a good portion, but we both agreed it was pretty bad otherwise. Ingredients didn't seem fresh and it was just a run of the mill salad for 15 bucks. My boyfriend had some of the pizza our friends ordered and wasn't enticed by it.\n\nOur friends did seem to enjoy their pizza and I do have to say the beers were pretty cheap as my boyfriend enjoyed a few of them to help get through the salad ;) \n\nSo, seems like everyone loves this place but unfortunately my experience with both service and food was very very Meh."

I'm a huge fan of thin crust pizza!! Also for less than $20 you get a quality pizza!\n\nI read that they bake their pizza using brick ovens, but with a special kind of coal called \"anthracite\" which is a more premium coal because it has a high carbon content and few impurities. \n\n& since they originated in NYC and wanted to bring the same flavor to other cities, they do not use our water system here in the LV valley- instead they use the NYC water pumping system installed in every location to bring that flavor here. \n\nFirst I will say, that the service at this location was a little below what I'm used to, normally get my pizza lightly cooked on the crust, because they normally bring it out a a little charred. I requested it but still got the charred crust. :(  If you like a little buttery crust, I recommend asking for it lightly cooked. \n\nWe order our pizza with basil (you can get it baked on top or after baking, so it's still \"raw,\" with pepperoni, and with italian sausage. Extra toppings of course cost a little more. \n\nI haven't tried their desserts yet, since this location is in the palazzo, Bouchon bakery is soo close. So I ran right over there. :P\n\n4/5 stars- because of the service at this location. Otherwise 5 stars for the awesomeness of the pizza!"

Service was ok, but I took my pizza to go so I cannot say much about it. One major flaw: not enough cheese and each topping is at least $2 (but it is vegas, so no surprise about the pricing). Easily accessible is you are staying at the Palazzo."

The pizza is New York style, meaning its thin and crispy.  The sizes are hearty so a personal can feed two people and a large can feed 3-4 guys.  Their pizzas all taste really fresh and are made to order... you can even watch the chef throw the pizza dough in the air.  Their salads are also really good and their small salads are definitely shareable.  The decor is a cross between an old school italian joint and a BJs restaurant.  Both times I've been here, the service has been great.  \n\nThis place has earned a spot in my Vegas restaurant rotation."

You'll find better at Sam's Club or Costco.\n\nLong:\n\nFor the most part, the pizza here is no better than what you'll find at Pizza Hut or Dominoes. Tasteless crust, cheap sauce, cheap and skimpy toppings with a tiny bit of cheese. There's only better quality control (how little quality there is) and better service. There's also no specialty pizzas here; just the same toppings you can get anywhere else, you just have to list out what you want. I was really hoping for a margarita pizza, but you won't find one here.\n\nI'm a big pizza fan and I often make my own pizza. So when a friend of mine got a birthday deal to have one free pizza from this place, we visited. We arrived and was ushered over to a table. The waitress and waiters were nice, but a bit too courteous as every-other-minute they were checking on us. You don't need three waiters to refill water people. \n\nWe ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. It took a while to come out, but not too long. When it arrived, we noticed the top was just swamped with juice and oil--this became a problem as the pizza became soggy after a few minutes (so I don't recommend ordering out).\n\nThe pizza... was acceptable. That's it. Me and my friend found ourselves piling on parmesan cheese and oregano to get some flavor out of the pizza because it didn't have much. Let me break it down:\n\nGood pizza starts at the dough. The bread/crust on this pizza was dull and tasteless. After a while, half of it got soggy. The only good part was the end crust where the over charred it a bit. HOWEVER, this place is suppose to be coal-fired, right? Well, the bottom of the crust was no crispier or better cooked than elsewhere. It wasn't even thin enough to create a cracker-thin crust. I've had proper coal-fire pizza and this place is a joke compared to the real thing. \n\nThe sauce is a water-down, flavor-less tomato sauce. \n\nThe cheese they put on it, while are slices of mozzarella, are so thin that it doesn't melt nor does it spread out. It's just wavers of cheese that don't give the pizza any flavor.\n\nThe toppings are the next joke. The mushrooms were of good size (not the thin sliced version), but the sausage is the frozen/ball sausage every-other pizza joint uses. Nothing special, nothing unique. The same frozen sausage balls.\n\n\nIn the end, I don't recommend this place. I am dead honest about the Sam's Club and Costco thing; they make better pizza and sell it at half the price! HALF THE PRICE! This place is almost a joke after I list everything out, but it's certainly isn't bad. I didn't get sick, I didn't walk out unhappy, but surely I would be pissed if I had paid $20 for that pizza. The birthday deal is worth trying this place, though."

I was excited to find out that there was a location on the west coast!!\n\nPizza here is a bit more pricey, but it is yummy. A personal 12 inch pizza is $9 and toppings are $2 each... and it doesn't matter what size you get! So for a small pizza, you don't get as much value with toppings. I had a personal with pepperoni and mushrooms which is $13 and $14 with tax. Not bad and it satisfied me. \n\nPizza is thin crust and oven baked. Very light and tasty. Since the pizza is thin, a personal will fill up a hungry person, if you are not too hungry, then it might be good for 2 people. I had left overs and ate it the next morning in my room and it still tasted good!!\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that you can't charge to your room!! I was staying at the Venetian and I wanted my points!! Also, this is located on the Palazzo side of the shopping upstairs, like the end on the Palazzo side, so if you are staying at the Venetian, or like me in the Venezia tower, it can be a bit of a walk!"

After striking out at a few other places on Friday night, we remembered that smell and followed our noses.  It turned out to be a pretty good idea.  \n\nPizzas are cooked to order in a wood-fired pizza oven.  It has standard Italian pizzeria decor and they can accommodate fairly large groups, as there are some bigger tables there.  Plus most of the seats have a pretty good view of the bridge entrance of the Palazzo. \n\nThe basic large pizza is what you get for a flat fee, and then each topping is a couple extra dollars.  If you keep it simple, it is very affordable.  Like a proper pizza, everything is thin crust. They only have traditional toppings, like pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, et cetera - you won't find any pineapples here!\n\nThe cheese is real pieces of fresh mozzarella, not shredded generic cheese.  So you won't have complete cheese coverage, but it will be great.  The salads you can order are also family style and fairly large.  They are worth it. \n\nOverall if you are looking for an affordable,simple, and tasty pizza, this place is a good bet."

My personal favorite was the white pizza. So simple yet very flavorful! I wouldn't say this is the best pizza I have ever had but it's definitely something you should try.\n\nExpect your experience to be quick, we ordered the pizzas and were in and out in less than an hour.

Went here for dinner on a recent trip to las vegas.\nThis is located in the Venetian hotel, but is on the second floor (I think), and we took a while to find it. Better to ask for directions rather than roam around trying to find it yourself. \n\nIt is decorated a little differently from the NYC locations, but it has the traditional feel of an italian pizzeria. They also have sort of an outside seating as well, which gives a pseudo-patio feeling. They have some ny based props like subway signs hanging around, and is brightly lit. The place is reasonably large, but generally is pretty crowded. We saw a lot of families dining there.\n\nIt took us 20 minutes to be seated after getting there at 7 on a Saturday night, pretty reasonably for a weekend dinner. Once seated, service was prompt and attentive. Our server was very jolly and friendly. He made good conversation and suggestions. \n\nWe got a bottle of wine to share, and all the different bruschetta to start off. I really liked the mushroom one, but all of them were great. We got three different pizzas to share, one pepperoni, one chicken, and one vegetarian. All of them were really good, but again, not as good as its original locations.\n\nThe pizzas are huge. The smallest personal one can easily be shared by two, unless you've not eaten the entire day. The large pizzas are more suited for 5 people. We had to box much of our pizzas, which were useful the next morning. \nThe prices are very reasonable, and of excellent value here. Since portions are large, it's great to share.\n\nDefinitely recommend this to everyone for some great pizza and good atmosphere for dinner, if you want to avoid the fancy restaurants and bars, or are with family. It's not an intimate or classy place, but again, it's just an informal pizzeria."

It's like the trendy thing to do now. But anyways having eaten at the OG Grimaldis in New York, I didn't have high expectations that it would nearly as good. It was semi busy for dinner so we just got a large pie to go. They don't offer any of the normal combos like pepperoni or meat lovers or veggie. It's all customizable pizzas or al la carte with you choosing the size and whatever toppings you want. There were 4 of us and we got a large as it's only 2 bucks more than a medium. There were about 10 huge slices so I think it's perfect for a group of 5. We had regular pizza with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese (included) with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni (extra). They said about 15-20 minutes but I believe we waited more like half an hour. Lame, could've walked around more versus waiting in front. But the pizza was hot and delicious. The cheese tasted fresh and was super gooey and each slice had lots of each of the toppings. Again, not as good as what I remember from NY but it hit the spot and it wasn't super pricey - pretty much on spot with what I paid on the east coast."

All I am saying is that it was good pizza and that is all I have to say.  I agree with a reviewer below ... the bathroom is terrible, and the service was ok.  Caesar salad was also ok, nothing spectacular.  I won't even mention what I want to say (which is that I can name a bunch of places back home that are better) because I will immediately get attacked by the zealots, but it's just my humble op.  :-)"

Since we had 10 people in our party, I made a reservation ahead of time. We were seated right away when we arrived. One thing I like about this location is that it seems a lot more open than it's Green Valley counterpart. (I always feel like we're squished in there.) \n\nOur waitress was great and very patient with our large group. She also made suggestions on wines after we told her what we were looking for. We ordered two large salads to share - Caesar and Greek - and they were your classic salads you might find elsewhere. However, the pizza is what we came for and both the Brooklyn Bridge and the Four Cheese were excellent. One of the pizzas had a 2-inch hole in it which, truthfully we might not have noticed had the manager not pointed it out and told us they were making us another small size of the same pizza for that reason. On top of all that, they were quick but not suspiciously quick!"

However, if you are looking for an AMAZING experience for pizza make your way to the secret pizza place at the Cosmopolitan (hands downs totally worth it!!!) Girmaldi's is a sit down restaurant with plenty of seating and towards the back of the restaurant you can see them making your pizza. Our waitor was friendly. Prices are reasonable as they offer the traditional pizza with their special sauce (regular red sauce), white with garlic, and pesto. They have a variety of toppings to select from ($2-4/each). The dough was nice and chewy but the pizza itself was bland. We ordered a large half red half white with pepperoni, chicken, artichoke, and olives. Their salads were good and large portions, would definitely recommend splitting. Probably won't be seeing you again Grimaldi's."

Anyways, this place was recommended by one of the managers working at the Venetian.  It HAD to be good.\n\nSo they have personal, medium, and large; we opted for the large at ($18).  You select your toppings starting at ($2) each; we chose the fresh garlic and Italian sausage.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#STZXp7K9wnVPNTo4mWOYFw This is probably one of the few times I've had NY style crust, and WHOA it tastes so delicious, especially when it's hot and the handmade (!) mozzarella is so melty, creamy, and cheesy.  There were nice, soft tomato chunks in the pizza sauce.  \n\nI'd recommend trying their salads, we ordered the large Caesar salad ($9) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#x8UalMguK50OYQZmSPWA4A to munch on while the pizza was baking.  I don't know how they make salads so good, because the lettuce was cut into SMALL bite-sized pieces, dewy but not too wet, and the caesar dressing was perfectly spicy and peppery.  Topped with fresh parmesan cheese... YEAH A VERY GOOD SALAD.  \n\nThe decor is beautiful in here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#nKsnllmo62-w6zwkqh4Jow Bottomless wine bottles with tiny lights in them are configured in a chandelier arrangement on the ceiling.  Their \"patio\" area opens into the mall area, and sort of in a corner location so I'd recommend sitting in the regular dining area (which is more beautiful).  But the patio does open right into the bar area.\n\nQuick, attentive service.  No problem at all."

I'm pretty sure most people thought I was either lost or plotting to rob the place, but Grimaldi's still let me inside...\n\nRoss, bartender extraordinaire, made my morning. He made sure I had an icy pint of delicious beer that never seemed to get warm or reach the bottom. His cocktails (yes, plural; don't judge) were also amazing, capped off with witty reparte\u00e9. Strong enough that I didn't inhale them, but still didn't taste like jet fuel or a pending hangover.\n\nBomb ass pepperoni pizza. Thin crust with crispy edges, delicious sauce, fresh mozzarella and meats that tasted fresh from the butcher. Enough said.\n\nThere is full menu service at bar, which also has two TVs in plain sight, so you don't have to miss the game. Fun, funky, unique decor, including wine bottle chandeliers! Front and back indoor patios for people watching - a lot of Armani-clad Europeans kind of people-watching.\n\nGrimaldi's is a very entertaining and satisfying little\nlunch spot!

Maybe it was the New York water or being cooked in that original over 100-year-old brick oven, but it was just better. \n\nGrimaldi's has since then franchised out and I'm not sure if they even own that location in Brooklyn anymore. The pizza recipe and flavor is probably diluted a bit, but I love that familiar chewy crust. The ingredients are fresh and it definitely compares to any $15 fancy pizza that you may find in a hipster metropolitan restaurant.

Located inside the palazzo (NOT GRAND CANAL SHOPPES), it can be easily missed. A lot smaller than the other locations but service here is a lot better.\n\nWe had a party of 4 and were celebrating a birthday. My friend had a FREE large pizza for her birthday. We added meatballs, pepperoni and ricotta cheese. The meatballs are so soft and perfectly seasoned, not dry either. The pepperoni isn't like other pizza places that I've been to, it's a lot smaller and I don't really think it's that good. They don't skimp on the ricotta cheese either. Their pizzas aren't oily... Like at all. Each topping was about an additional $4. I feel that their toppings are limited but very fresh. They don't have any pineapple in case you're wondering. crust here is super thin but a large can definitely feed 3-4 people if you order sides!! I think a large pizza is $19.\n\nWe also ordered a large antipasto ($9) which came with bell peppers, mozzarella cheese, salami and olives. We were given slices of bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar to enjoy with the antipasto. We also ordered the large house salad ($9) which came with romaine lettuce, mushrooms, olives, red onions and I'm not sure if I remember seeing tomatoes or not. It has a light and refreshing dressing. \n\nThe 4 of us were too full to eat dessert so I would say be careful when you order a large pizza because it IS very large. Also, you can do half pizza with toppings and the other half with different toppings but you still have to pay the entire price for the toppings if that makes sense.\n\nOur server was so sweet, she explained the menu and their current specials and continually checked in on us. Our waters were always refilled. Food came out in a good amount of time. \n\nLovely decor, dim lighting, if you sit by the window you get a good view. Perfect for date nights."

Found out from the server, they treat the water to add minerals to mimic the water used for the dough in NYC. If you have never had coal fire pizza, you really need too. The ovens are even hotter than wood fire and that results in an even better dough. They make pizza the correct way, without too much cheese and a balanced sauce (not too sweet). If you need your real NYC pizza fix, you can't do better in Las Vegas. Definitely worth going out of the way for if you are craving great pizza."

Having been to the OG Grimaldi's in Brooklyn a couple years ago, I have to say the Vegas location does a pretty good job at emulating some of NY's finest slices of pizza. \n\nOur group of 6 came on a Saturday afternoon, and were seated right away. Damon was very friendly and suggested right off the bat that we get a small salad to share and The Don (the restaurant's must-have pizza). Damon says Grimaldi's LV is known for their salad and pizza, which they meticulously make to perfection. We ended up ordering a small spinach gorgonzola salad and large The Don and a large pizza with pesto, artichoke, and mushrooms on it. The salad was delicious and the small size was a perfect sample size for our group of 6. The pizzas came out in about 15-20 min. The Don impressed everyone, as the crust was baked to perfection and the toppings were amazing. I was so taken aback by the explosion of flavor in the italian sausage. I would put those bad boys in any Italian dish, whether it be pizza, pasta, or a sub, and call it a day. Our custom built pesto pizza was solid as well, but definitely not as memorable as The Don.\n\nOverall, Grimaldi's LV on its own is a solid 4 star establishment. Of course, it doesn't compare to Brooklyn's flagship. But hey, at least you don't have to wait an hour in line just to get in in Vegas. Great food, great service, a bar and tv's, can't go wrong here!"

It's in a quiet little corner of the Venetian and while not the cheapest pizza I've ever had, they do a great job staying as close as they can to a New York style pie. If you want something quick and easy, this is a good choice."

It also helps that it's open until 2:00 AM. \n\nA favorite is the Don. I like to customize it because I don't eat meatballs. They won't let you substitute or do \"half & half.\" For that reason, I have to deduct a star. Seems like an establishment that caters to its customers would allow a minor substitution or half-and-half on a pizza. Perhaps that's just me.\n\nOur pizza came out smoking hot and it was absolutely delicious. It was the perfect way to end a long drive into sin city. He also ordered a Caesar salad which was really good.\n\nService was friendly and efficient. No complaints there. Just wish they monitored the bathrooms more frequently.

We ordered A cheese pizza and added ricotta & grilled chicken. The dough, sauce, cheese (especially the ricotta! The ricotta was outstanding!), & seasonings were top notch.\n\nThe chicken, however, was definitely packaged / not fresh. It didn't match with the delicious fresh ingredients that made up the rest of the pizza. The grilled chicken was honestly kind of creepy & gross. It didn't taste good & some pieces were squishy. It was definitely a little offensive. *This is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.*\n\nDesert was also outstanding. We had the desert trio (you get to pick which 3, which I loved!) and got the caramel apple cheesecake, oreo cheesecake, and tiramisu. The cheesecakes are homemade and you can definitely tell. They were amazing. The tiramisu was so light & fluffy and tasted amazing as well. \n\nFinally, our server Rachel was super friendly, happy, and very attentive. She was great, especially since we were seated all the way in the back, we didn't wait long for anything. She was also very honest about answering questions and I really appreciated that!"

On my last visit, three of us girls ordered a large pizza - it was too much food and we ended up with some leftovers.  The food here is very tasty, and service pretty good, but sometimes the crust is too burnt and the utensils/table not always the cleanest.  Hence, the four stars instead of five for Grimaldi's.

            "review": "I was spending a lovely weekend in Vegas with some friends. After a night of moderate drinking we woke up to a feeling of utter agony. Our drunken state had turned into a hangover of the melancholy variety. Not even the freshest melons of Las Vegas could tame this horrid feeling. But wait, perhaps a small glimmer of hope. In the early 15th century, The Italians, with their delightful ingenuity, discovered a cure for this absolute evil of feelings brought on by the mishaps of the previous evening. Pizza. Let me say that word again as the words tend to drop from my lips like a melted cheese slowly slides off the beautiful dough disc from whence it started. PIZZA. \n\nWe all decided to give Grimaldis pizza a chance to wow us. It is located inside the palazzo hotel and casino. If you find yourself having trouble finding the place, you could always ask any one of the friendly people sauntering around the casino pretending to look busy. Be warned, however, as the directions given will not put you at your destination due to the fact that these fine folks here at the palazzo haven't a clue as to where anything is, or even their current surroundings in general. \n\nAfter traversing the second level, making our way through the parodies and disparaging mockery of the Italian culture, we finally made our way to the darkest corner where the pizza parlor resides. We approach the portly white gentleman behind the podium, and after a long awkward stare he asks how many of us there are. The four of us look at each other for a moment and respond with a stern \"four.\" After we established the amount of people that were standing in front of the dull young fellow, he then proceeded to inform us of news that we still to this day have never quite recovered from. Apparently, 4:00 pm pacific time is when this pizzeria begins their cleaning regimen. We were told that their ovens, of which the pizzas are prepared in, were being cleaned and would not be available for over an hour. This was the initial downfall of this establishment and, in my heated state of emotion, I was prepared to give a one star review for this folly. However, I remained diplomatic and decided to wait until I got the full experience. \n\nWe returned approximately 47 minutes later and much to my surprise, there was a new host. He sat us and told us he didn't know who our server would be, but someone would serve us. At this point an overwhelming wave of concern came over me. If the first two employees were showing this kind of incompetence, what could we expect with our server. Here is where things started to finally turn around...\n\nOur affable waiter approached the table with an absolute jovial disposition. His friendly mannerisms were out shined only by his knowledge of the handful of items listed on the barren menu. The appetizers consisted of a variety of unsatisfying salads. We decided not to waste our time with such trivial cuisine and went straight to ordering our grease pies. Three of the four party members order 12\" personal pizzas. The fourth decided to go with a calzone. Each topping cost hundreds of pennies, however due to the fact we were currently residing in Vegas, we decided to splurge. I requested a pizza consisting or pepperoni and standard breakfast bacon. Food was exceptional. Taste buds were tickled to a heavenly state. After receiving our food, we did not see our waiter again. \n\nAs for some things I may have left out, I'd like to rate separately as follows:\n\nService: Mediocre at best, not much to see here in terms of quality. One friendly face and kooky demeanor out of a staff of twenty sub par employees was not a saving grace. \n\nDecor & Ambiance: A tad blas\u00e9 for my tastes. Atmosphere left a lot to be desired. \n\nFood quality & Taste: May have been the saving grace, at the very least preventing me from giving a less than reputable one star rating. \n\nOverall experience: I'd prefer to rate a 2 1/2 stars for my overall experience, however it's an impossibility so I landed on a 3 star rating. Would only recommend if an absolute last resort or if a deranged captor is holding you at gunpoint and demands you feed him a lackluster slice of pizza."

Our waitress was very attentive and our drinks were all refilled multiple times , she came by often to ask how we were doing and how the food was. My only question is if you're going to give bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil to all tables why not have a little bowl dish for it? We had to either just put it on a flat plate or straight on the bread. Didn't work out too well. Maybe that's just me who thinks that is annoying but other than that I enjoyed the pizza and out service."

So when I received an email for a free pizza on my birthday from Grimaldi's I was quick to jump on the chance to give them another try.\n\nThis time we visited their store in Henderson. It's located in a quiet shopping center just off the 215. We opted to sit outside at their bar. Although it was July and pretty warm, we stayed cool under their misting system. \n\nThey had a nice selection of beer, with the classics and a few micro brews. I went with a Sam Adam's Summer Ale, one of my favorites. We ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza and while we were waiting we were entertained by the bartender. She was hysterical and provided us with exceptional service.\n\nJust like my first trip to Grimaldi's at the Venetian/Palazzo, their pizza was exceptional! They are consistently good pizza that takes me back to the east coast. \n\nIf you want to score a free pizza, like I did this trip, be sure to sign up for their mailing list.

There are a ton of good options, but we were looking for something quick and relatively cheap. We almost settled for the food court inside the Grand Canal Shoppes ($10 ish dollars per person), but luckily we opted for something better. \n\nGrimaldi's is located near the Wynn pedestrian bridge entrance to the Palazzo. It's on the upper level with Palazzo's shopping area. We were quickly seated in the main dining room, which had an open look into the pizza kitchen where you can see the cooks baking your coal fired pizzas. We ordered a large pizza (18\" - 8 slices) with Italian sausage and mushrooms. The pizza was very tasty - I particularly liked the flavorful sausage and the red sauce. \n\nThe large size is $16, with each additional topping ranging from $2-$4. We got one pizza with two toppings to share so our total bill came out to be around $21 without tip, which is less than we would have paid at the food court!!! Moral of this story: skip the food court and get some real food in a nice relaxed atmosphere at Grimaldi's!"

If you're inside Palazzo, look for the waterfall on the 1st floor and go up the escalator to the right. It's on the 2nd floor opposite direction of the waterfall.  Look for the exit/entrance to the Palazzo and it's right there!\n\nWhat to get:  for a family of 4 with two toddlers, start with a large Cesar salad and get a large size pizza with meatballs and extra sauce. The pizzas have a really thin crust so its not as filling so it may not be enough for others. So yummy!  Although I still think Tony's Napoletano in SF is still #1 at the top of my list, this is still great!"

Came here because of the great Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.\n\nHow good is the pizza? I ordered a Caprese salad to start, and it was probably one of the worst Caprese salads I have ever had. Dry and chewy mozzarella, flavorless tomato, limp basil, weak olive oil. I order Caprese salads almost everywhere they are offered and this is in the bottom 2 or 3 I have ever eaten. But the pizza here is SO good that I am giving 5 stars anyway. That's how good it is.\n\nIt's a coal-fired brick oven, thin crust pizza. With dough made from water they truck across the country from New York just to make it authentic. We had a pizza with spicy sausage, pepperoni and sliced tomatoes, and it was epic. It was \"I want to go throw up in the bathroom like the Ancient Romans to make room for more of this pizza\" epic. It was \"if someone runs in and grabs the last piece of pizza off my plate, I am chasing him down and beating him to death with a chair\" epic. \n\nDammit, now I need more of it. Thanks, Yelp. Just writing this review has convinced me I need to make another trip for more."

I love the pizza here and I know we have one in Dallas but I just come to this one for some reason. \n\nI know there are a couple of other good spots but I love the service here. I always sit at the bar whether I'm alone or with a friend. \n\nShawmbi was the bartender this night and he was awesome. I made a new friend at the bar too. I gave her a couple of slices of my pizza and she said it was \"yummy\". We then went on to play some craps after we finished our meal. ;) This is like the third time I made a friend at the bar and we went on to play some craps. \n\nSo if you love pizza you should def give this place a try. It's thin and always comes out in good time and hot. The kitchen is open late and you can also get your pizza to go if you don't want to dine in. \n\nThe salads are huge here just so u know. I could not finish mine. They have lots of toppings for pizzas. I haven't tried anything else on the menu though. It's all about the pizza for me. \n\nOrder a small pizza if you're alone. Sometimes it can even be enough for two depending on your appetite. \n\nPrices are very reasonable too. Of course I'm going back next time."

Staying at the Palazzo I noticed the advertisement billboard for it in the elevator lobby and didn't think much of it until we had our family over the hotel visiting and instead of eating out we decided to order to go and eat in our Bella Suite.  I have no idea what the pizzeria looks like and really don't care because on taste alone, it can be cooked on a cookie sheet and a lighter as long as it tasted that good.  I couldn't place what kind of cheese was used but I think it was manchego cheese along with the pepperoni and oh the spice, the spices just made for the best slice of pizza I've ever had.   \n\nI can't wait to return to Vegas just to have the pizza, this time I will eat at the pizzeria."

I consider myself an experienced pizza eater and attended with my resident pizza expert.\n\nWe were both in agreement that this pizza was did not live up to the hype. All the toppings were bland.  I don't know how you can rob bacon of its flavor but they managed to achieve this task here.  A large pepperoni, mushroom, bacon and half Italian sausage pizza was ordered and was just largely disappointing.\n\nThe artisan crust on a New York style pizza just doesn't work for me.  \n\nNow any red blooded American knows that ranch is mandatory with pizza.  Not hidden valley bottled ranch but a creamy delicious fresh made ranch more than complements a slice... It completes it.  So as we dined on America's birthday we requested ranch and were denied!  They do not have ranch because the executive chef does not approve of low brow ranch.  After this statement was made the server proceeded to bring out a shaker of, fresh out of the powdered bottle, of Parmesan cheese.  Ranch isn't acceptable but this is?  \n\nI will not be returning.

Stop making stupid people famous!  And stop over hyping bullsh*t food! This is the furthest thing from good pizza.

I keep falling for the hype and I'm constantly getting punished with bad food.\n\nI've given up on trying to find good pizza in CA. Many of my friends said that Grimaldi's the shiz but it's in vegas. You know that saying about whatever happens in vegas? This pizza should never leave vegas. Grimaldi's, stay put because your pizza is fraudulent. You do not serve \"NYC style pizza\", you serve a sub par version of the same thing I can get at a pieology franchise and it's waaaaaaay less expensive. Pieology also labels their pizza properly. Grimaldi's, you serve neopolitan style and you do it poorly.\n\nOnce the pizza arrived at our table, just looking at it, I was already disappointed. It was burnt, not browned. The sauce looked like it just came straight out of a BPA lined can. \n\nWhen i took my first bite, I noticed that it was under seasoned and that blaring red sauce was way too acidic. Have these cooks ever heard of using sugar to cut down on the acid? WTF, this is amateur sh*t people! This is pizza sauce 101. I made a better pizza with a boboli crust when I was a kid and I didn't even know what the f*ck I was doing back then.\n\nAlso, I have never had a pizza turn my hands black. Yes, my hands were black. (See napkin picture)\n\nThis place is a bust. Over priced. Over hyped. The odds will be against you. The \"pizza\" only lives up to the first part of its namesake, \"Grim\"."

My boyfriend and I just happened across this place as we were walking through the Venetian, and made it a point to come here based on the reputation of the New York location. Going in, I was a little confused about what to expect because the restaurant is set up to look like a casual, fast pizza place, but mixed with fine dining. For example, they had checkerboard/picnic blanket table cloths, but each table had a couple of wine glasses. I wasn't sure where on the scale of Little Caesars to artisan pizza this was going to fall. \n\nThankfully, there was no wait here, unlike what I've heard about the New York location. We were seated right away and the hostess was very accommodating when I asked to be seated at a table other than the one she initially pointed out. I really liked the table that we did sit at, because we could look out of the restaurant and see the crystal decorations of the Venetian. \n\nOur server was with us right away as well and quickly brought out water with ice upon our request. He let us take our time to figure out what we wanted to eat, and even suggested a small salad while we decided. \n\nWe chose the Caesar Salad, and as our server suggested, it was more than enough for the two of us. It was also really tasty; I almost forgot to take a picture of it before it was all gone. The lettuce was fresh and the dressing was evenly tossed. The croutons were also really great, large pieces and very crunchy. The salad was topped off with fresh shaved parmesan and our server also helped us with some cracked pepper. Very good start to the meal.\n\nThe pizza menu does not have many preset combinations eg. veggie/meat lovers. Instead, they have a basic crust with sauce and cheese (prized on size)  and you can add on toppings for $2-$4 based on what they are. I believe the cost of the topping is regardless of size of the pizza you choose. The are based on \"premium\" vs \"regular\" topping eg. artichoke vs extra cheese. They also have an option of red or white sauce and a pesto option.\n\nFor our pizza, we knew we wanted Italian Sausage on there right away, but for the rest of the toppings, we were a bit more selective based on each others' preferences and the quickly increasing price. I consented to Pepperoni while my boyfriend allowed for the Fresh Sliced Roma Tomatoes. We also got the Fresh Baby Spinach, Fresh Garlic, and Extra Mozzarella Cheese. We ordered it all on a small size (16 inch) pizza, which was enough for the two of us.\n\nIt did take a while for the pizza to come out, but we enjoyed our time watching from the window. When the pizza arrived, I was so excited because it was bigger than I expected, and it also smelled and looked amazing. I consider myself to be a pizza genius now, because the combination of toppings we had picked out worked so awesome together. I know, it's just a basic meat pie, but I thought it was almost mind-blowing. The sausage was very traditional and tasty and complemented their famous sauce very well. I also loved the spinach on the pizza and wish there had been more. The garlic really made the dish for me, I really looked forward to the bites where I could see little clusters of garlic. Really, each bite was packed with flavor and I could not stop eating. \n\nEven though I was completely stuffed after the pizza, I wanted to order the Tiramisu because my boyfriend had never had it before. While it was not the best tiramisu I have ever had, it was quality dessert and a very good first try for my boyfriend. We both enjoyed how creamy the mascarpone was and how moist the ladyfingers were.\n\nThe highlight of this experience was definitely the pizza (as it should be) and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. With the personalization of the pizzas, everyone can get something they love."

They're also open til 2AM which is a plus! \n\nThe menu is typical Grimaldi's pizza or salad.  Pizza selections include a regular pizza, pizza with pesto, white pizza with garlic or a calzone.  There's a variety of toppings you can select from including sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, italian sausage, ham and sweet red peppers just to name a few.  We opted for the small white pizza with garlic, italian sausage, kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes. This was delicious and the small comes with big slices! I think there were six slices total.  They were generous with the toppings as well. We both loved the olives (and yay we didn't get any pits!).  \n\nOur server was great, very energetic and enthusiastic.  Food came out fairly quick (granted it was later in the evening 11PMish).\n\nLove Grimaldi's and was happy to get a taste of NYC on the west!"

Based on a friends suggestion we came over to the Venetian to eat here. We were greeted warmly and sat down. We were well attended to the whole time even though our waiter had just been sat at least a 15 top. The small salad was more than enough for two and the house vinaigrette is delicious. My boyfriend preferred the Caesar.  And the personal pizza hit the spot I got the garden freak minus the Roma tomatoes. If you're looking for a great pizza place this is the one."

You should know how most people feel about Sundays in Vegas. My friend ordered the Margherita pizza and I thought it was okay. The sauce seemed really bland. I am not really a fan of pizza with bland pizza sauce. The pizza's dough didn't really grab at me either. The crust was thin and you can actually watch some of the staff toss pizza. I think the place is good about accommodating large groups and the staff are pretty chill. I also learned they do not have ginger ale but they can attempt to make ghetto ginger ale. The keyword is 'attempt' Ghetto ginger ale consists of Sierra Mist with a splash of pepsi. My friend who ordered this concluded does not taste like Ginger ale. Not really sure why they bother. They should flat out say no and not offer this option. I gave it three stars cause the staff was chill but really food wise I would give it two. I am not really all that intrigued to come back."

We added our own toppings: pesto base, Italian sausage, mushrooms, olives, fresh tomatoes, & sweet peppers on thin yummy crust. It took time to prepare but was very much worth it, so delicious! We got thge large 18 inch for 4 of us which was more than plenty. We also had the Mediterranean Salad came in a largish bowl, it was so fresh, crispy and a very good size that you can easily split. For dessert we had the Baileys Irish cream cheesecake and Tiramisu, both were excellent. They made the cheesecake in house (!) and the Tiramisu they order. My mom hates cheesecake, but the Irish cream flavor made her love it. Honestly, one of the best freshest cheesecakes I've ever had. Service was also excellent. I would absolutely go again if this was in PDX. The atmosphere at the Palazzo was lovely, made to feel like you are in Italy. It was funny when the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit inside or out and my dad asked my mom for his jacket hahah. I mean, you are inside regardless but with that beautiful blue painted sky, it's easy to forget!"

The fact that I'm starving? Do they really ship the water for the pizza all the way from NYC? No, but after having the pizza here, I'd believe it. According to their website, they actually hired \"...a chemist to analyze and recreate the mineral content and exact composition of the water.\"\n\nI had a large pepperoni pizza with sausage on half of it and mushroom on the other half. It was everything you expect New York pizza to be. So so good! I loved the thin crispy, slightly burnt crust and the quality ingredients. The the mini pepperonis were just perfect with the sausage. I don't normally eat the crust but it was that good.\n\nMy absolute favorite pizza place. If only I lived in Vegas. Located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, there is rarely a wait.

            "review": "Over the course of my Vegas trips with the No1DP I've seen people carrying pizza boxes from Grimaldi's. The No1DP, being a huge fan of NY-style pizza, never fails to get a slice every time he's in the area. It not only serves up a good slice but its location just outside the entrance to the Venetian|Palazzo complex is a short walk from the hotel the No1DP is staying (usually the Palazzo or Encore). I finally got a chance to eat here as an alternative to another nearby restaurant as I though this place would serve a no-frills yet delicious meal shortly before my flight.\n\nCONCEPT: Grimaldi's Pizza is known for its signature coal-burning oven, specifically anthracite coal. It burns more cleanly than gas or wood and the oven reaches to 1200F. Supposedly the water system is specifically designed to emulate NY-style water that is used in making authentic NY-style pizza dough (thin and crispy).\n\nVENUE: Grimaldi's is close to the entrance of the Venetian|Palazzo when coming from the bridge that connects the hotel complex with the Wynn/Encore. There was plenty of indoor seating on a Sunday night. They are not truly affiliated with the Palazzo so they cannot use resort credit/comps to pay for the bill. \n\nSERVICE: Our service for the most part was attentive except at the end where she didn't catch that we wanted tiramisu to go.\n\nWe opted for the house salad with mozzarella addition (romaine lettuce, red onion, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms, green olives, vinaigrette dressing, $6/small).  The bowl was generous with its non-lettuce toppings and certain veggies such as cherry tomatoes, red onion and olives tasted fresh. I think I got full quite quickly due to the veggies.\n\nThe No1DP is a traditionalist - he wants his pizza with tomato sauce (I gently suggested to try pesto or white pie with garlic to no avail) so we got the small pizza (16 inches - 6 slices, serves 2-3 people, $14). For toppings we got pepperoni ($3), sausage ($3), mushrooms ($2), green bell peppers ($2) and onions ($2). The crust was thin and crispy and the cheese oozed out of the slice. Pepperonis were small and crunchy, mushrooms were juicy and there was a good amount of onions. The big perk about these pies is that they are easily customizable to diner's preferences though there are certain pre-made pies available.\n\nOne big perk was that the No1DP and I technically paid with resort winnings. Were able to pay for this meal with our modest $58 we won from betting the outside track on roulette then converted it to cash. Thanks Palazzo.\n\nThis is our preferred pizza place on the Venetian|Palazzo side of the Strip (Secret Pizza at the Cosmo is our preferred pizza place on the other side as I see more than a handful of people carrying Secret Pizza boxes)"

I had heard of Grimaldi's and planned on trying them when I make it out to NY, but I was more than happy to check out their Palazzo location when our group of seven dropped in for lunch.  Legit NY pizza in Vegas?  Sure, why not?\n\nUnlike a lot of pizza restaurants, Grimaldi's menu doesn't include any preset combinations or house specials (though they also offer salads and calzones).  Instead, you first choose the size and sauce base you want (regular, white with garlic, and pesto), then add on whatever toppings you like.  With two dozen to choose from (ranging from $2-$5 each), the possibilities are nearly endless!\n\nAfter taking our server's recommendation for a small (it's perfect for two), my friend and I decided to share a Small White Pizza with Garlic ($16) and topped it with Italian Sausage (+$2), Mushrooms (+$2), and Green Peppers (+$2).  As far as taste goes, the pizza wasn't bad.  The toppings were decent and plentiful, and the white garlic sauce was solid.  Unfortunately though, I thought the crust/dough was disappointing.  While I liked how it was on the thin side, I wasn't a fan of the taste (somewhat bland) or the texture - neither doughy nor crispy and almost wafer like (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=qXMjD_wj8bWP8TVUdoUpcQ#KxHxBodbVP3RZ6GHtw2fAw).\n\nIn addition to our own, I also got to try a slice of my other friend's Personal Regular ($9) with Anchovies (+$2), Green Peppers (+$2), and Jalapeno (+$2).  The crust on his was slightly better, but the tomato sauce didn't do it for me (I generally prefer white sauce pizzas).  And while his mix of toppings may seem odd, they actually worked okay despite the anchovies being pretty salty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=qXMjD_wj8bWP8TVUdoUpcQ#79Jq5QbDxfeb3U5zJ8Gk9Q).\n\nEven though the pizza didn't do it for me, I can sort of see why Grimaldi's is so highly received.  Given their reputation, the Yelp reviews, and the apparent superiority of their original locations, I'll give Grimaldi's another chance when I'm in NY.  With lower expectations, perhaps their Brooklyn bridge location will do the trick."

It was just as good as the location on Eastern! \n\nI think the biggest difference we noticed between here and the Eastern location and this spot was the service. Don't get me wrong, the service at Eastern is great...but the service here was exemplary! Just about as good as it gets! I believe our servers name was JP and he was great!\n\nIn fact we were so impressed with our experience here, we decided that we will make the extra effort and drive to come to this location in the future! Great service, great food, with great ambiance! \n\nSo this seems like a foregone conclusion, but I have to give it..\n\n5 stars! We will be back!"

Upon first glance, the pizza looked extremely soggy for something that just came out of the oven a few minutes before. The smell of the pizza was very off putting as the cheese had a strange bitter aftertaste. The pepperoni looked and tasted like frozen pizza quality. I could barely muster in two slices before I called it quits. Everything just tasted like a mushy, soggy mess and almost uneatable. Pizza Hut would've been so much better...\n\nThis is NY style pizza gone wrong. Way wrong. \n\n+1 for being located right downstairs from my hotel room"

Then the pizza arrived, the plain cheese pizza and the white pizza were both above average with an nice thin crispy crust.  Aside from the food the service was outstanding.

And pizza is what they can make. For a venue at the Las Vegas Strip, you'd be amazed at how low the prices are. I applaud their take on staying true to their prices while other restaurants opt for an increase. \n\nSo when I found myself sitting at Grimaldi's with what they call a \"small\" pizza, I was in for a surprise. I had the pleasure of trying out the Brooklyn Bridge which had oven roasted red peppers, creamy ricotta, cheese and Italian sausage. I don't even know how to begin describing this. \n\nIt's thin crust, but it's not a disgusting thin crust that it's crunchy upon bite. It's a good ratio of dough, sauce, cheese and fresh ingredients that it's difficult to stop even when you're full. I was instructed to fold the pizza while eating it because New Yorkers customarily ate it that way for the purpose of munching on-the-go. You can just imagine how impressive of a revelation that must've been for me. \n\nThe service was all around friendly. Our server consistently asked whether we needed anything else at our table, and they made suggestions about the dessert. When my pal spilled his drink, the waiter did not show a hint of annoyance. Instead, he ensured that the issue was taken care of right away. When they made a mistake on our order, they made certain that we were happy with what we had. Of course, we were happy. With good food, good service, and good company, who could complain?"

Nothing close to the original in NY!!! \nOur crust was burnt (black edges) on almost half the pizza, but the dough was undercooked. Almost like a mushed hard pita. The sauce, pepperoni and sausage were all good, but I had ordered extra basil and I did NOT even taste ANY basil! The house salad was good, but the green olives were still raw and hard to bite into. Service was ok, but it was just a waste of stomach space considering vegas has so many other restaurants. If i'm going to eat Pizza, it has to be amazing.

We ordered a white pizza with artichoke hearts, jalapenos, spicy chicken sausage and onions. Each topping was an additional cost (there was no such option for 1 or 2 free toppings plus extra for any additional) so the pizza was a bit pricey but DAMN IT WAS GOOD. Well, it was a tad spicy for me so I had to pick off some of the jalapeno slices but mmm. The crust was light and airy and the combination of all the toppings was perfect.

I haven't been to their original Brooklyn location, so i'm not sure how true they stay to their original recipe. However, I do know good pizza when I taste it and Grimaldi's in Las Vegas is excellent. \n\nThe pizza at Grimaldi's is prototypical NY style pizza with a thinner crust. The crust is thin and airy, but still maintains its structural integrity without being bogged down by toppings. In addition to the traditional red sauce, you have the option of getting white garlic or pesto pizza. Our group of 4 shared 2 large (18  inch) pizzas, one traditional and one white garlic. My favorite pizza was the red sauce meatball pizza. It was addictive. I wasn't as big of a fan of the white garlic pizza. \n\nSurprisingly, I don't believe there is any price inflation at this Las Vegas location and the prices are similar to other Grimaldi's. It is actually pretty affordable in comparison to other sit-down restaurants on the strip. A large pizza is $16 and consists of 8 slices. Toppings are extra and run you $2-4 each.\n\nWe also ordered a large salad to share and a few beers. We ended up paying around $25  each, which was a steal since we were all stuffed afterwards. Grimaldi's is a definitely a good option if you're looking for a casual, low-key sit-down restaurant on the strip that does not break the bank."

The restaurant itself has a lot of NY decor including pictures and signs.\n\nThe servers are very attentive and the food comes out pretty quick. It's perfect to come and eat on ur own too since they do offer personal size pizzas and bar seating. I am a small girl, so i wasn't able to finish the personal pizza, so maybe a man  would be satisfied with a personal. \n\nI would reccomend asking for extra sauce, just because i felt the pizza was a little dry with the normal amount of sauce it came with."

So thankful that we decided to try something new. Great service and wonderful food!!! \n\nThe vibe is truly great beautiful restaurant. We created our own pizza and got a house salad. Our server was so nice and I believe the manager brought out our pizza. So excited for the one opening up in California. My coworker had been to New York and said it tasted just like it. Definitely recommend!!"

I waited in the hour and a half line outside the Brooklyn location because I heard it was so good and I'm glad I did. Everything about this pizza is amazing. Their sauce is what makes the pizza. Their crust is also very good. The Vegas location was a just as good as the Brooklyn location and you didn't have to wait the hour and a half. Definitely check out Grimaldi's if you want a good pie."

It still amazes too think it all started with the one location all the way in Henderson (for me opposite side of town) and now they have multiple locations all over the Valley. So whenever have my itch for think crust pizza always Grimaldi close by! It was my first time at this particular location. The food it was par with all the other Grimaldi's the perfect think crust, love the sauce, and love the toppings am two topping type of pizza lover. Only because feel with this style of pizza ONLY way too go because love the crust less is better. The fresh buffalo mozzarella not but loving there. Pizza awesome like always!\n\nThe service our server was very friendly, never had empty glass, and management was very much present checking up on us. It smaller location compare too two other locations been too. I always fan of the decor with the brick style walls, the red and white checkerboard table cloth, the simplicity of the menu, and the empty win bottle for lights. The old rat pack style of music playing in the restaurant or specifically Frankie Sinatra. \n\nIt nice that now there so many options in Fashion Show Mall not just food court!"

Both locals and tourists come and go so your product will either keep you in business or drive you out.  But Grimaldi's Pizza is darn good.  \n\nI was with a friend and when she smelled pizza in the air she all of a sudden wanted to sit down and eat.  There's another pizza place here, California Pizza Kitchen, which is good as well.  But we've never had Grimaldi's before so we decided to sit down here and try it out.  So come to find out we'll be dining a New York pizza.  I've had a Chicago pizza so I was curious to see how it competes with a New York style pizza.  \n\nWe shared a small white w/garlic pizza ($16) and added mushrooms ($2), pepperoni ($2), and artichoke hearts ($4).  A $25 pizza split between two people is not bad at all if you're saving money for shopping.  There had to be at least 20 toppings so have your go with it.  Secret to a good pizza however is the sauce and cooking method.  The sauce was delicious and the coal burning method (love wood burning as well) worked perfectly.  Our pizza was delicious, I just don't know what makes this a New York pizza.  Service was good but it took so long for our pizza to come out and it wasn't even busy inside.  Our quick dine wasn't so quick.\n\nDo come and have a pizza!"

Dressing is really good and they aren't stingy with the fresh shaved parmesan.\nThe White Pizza with Garlic is my favorite. I always add basil cooked into the pizza and on occasion add meatball. \nThe crust is a thin crispy crust, very tasty, but I don't like to load it up with too many toppings. I like a thicker crust to help handle the weight of lots of stuff on my pizza.\nThat is one of the main downfalls of this place........ A somewhat limited menu. You are getting salad and thin crust pizza.  Period."

I spent the morning riding the coasters of Stratosphere Tower, and the afternoon sipping cocktails by the pool - it's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it! :-)\n\nWe wanted to hit Grimaldi's for an early dinner to allow plenty of time to get to Kevin Burke's hilarious one-man comedy, \"Defending the Caveman\" at Harrah's; we walked into the restaurant just after 5.  The atmosphere was warm, convivial, and very New York - in a Vegas sort of way; there are checkered tablecloths, and lots of brick.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-3?select=cOD5Zno5C-b0zmf22eg35w#cOD5Zno5C-b0zmf22eg35w \n\nGrimaldi's uses coal-fired ovens.  Why?  They say that pizza and Calzones baked in their signature coal burning oven offers a unique flavor and crisp crust that is just not possible from gas, convection or wood burning ovens, and that their fresh ingredients, handmade mozzarella, 'secret recipe' dough and pizza sauce make them the most award winning pizzeria in the United States.  Quite the hype - will the Carboholic's Delights served at Grimaldi's stand up to it?\n\nTo find out we ordered a personal coal-fired NY pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and garlic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-3?select=WWBG1joVWVnsTxBC1gAYRw#WWBG1joVWVnsTxBC1gAYRw Also a Calzone with sun-dried tomatoes, pesto, and mushrooms.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-3?select=aKH-9jIzcCrUwlW72GMpBA#aKH-9jIzcCrUwlW72GMpBA  \n\nGrimaldi's menu lacks any non-veggie starters; given that the pizza doesn't take very long to cook, that's not a show-stopper, but it sure wouldn't hurt if they added garlic bread or Bruschetta for those of us who like carbos while they wait for their carbos...\n\nWe didn't wait long for our food, but I was still very eager to try mine!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-3?select=kig3Un1Z7prfECX_Kj3AcA#kig3Un1Z7prfECX_Kj3AcA Grimaldi's original restaurant was first built underneath the Brooklyn Bridge http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-3?select=k0j5cq7KUMVIc9F6L_kCQg#k0j5cq7KUMVIc9F6L_kCQg long before my personal Escape from New York, but I never heard of it until recently, so I was several decades overdue for my first Grimaldi's fix.\n\nSaving what I thought would be the best for last I started with the Calzone.  Ricotta cheese is a default with the Calzone; it was smooth, creamy, and delicious!  Given it to do over again, next time I'll include sausage, but the taste of this Thing of carbo-intensive Beauty was wonderfully balanced even without meat - I don't think I've ever tasted a Calzone this good!\n\nMoving on to the meat of the matter, let's talk about Grimaldi's pizza!  Unlike a lot of NY pizzerias, Grimaldi's doesn't sell slices; just whole pies.  I was surprised when I saw the thickness of the crust up close and personal - for my money it's distinctly thinner than traditional NY Pizza; not quite Neapolitan, but getting pretty close.  It was so thin that I was a little concerned about this pizza's ability to stand up under another meat topping and extra cheese, so we went with just the two meat toppings and garlic; no problems with \"independent suspension\" on the first or second slices.  It was a slight issue with my friend's third, but nothing major.\n\nWhat did it taste like?  The scent of basil leaf added an enticing air to the delicious aroma.  I took a bite and the sauce yielded a burst of fresh tomato flavor; the cheese was exquisite!  It's not shredded - it's pure white, fresh mozzarella cheese, melted on the surface into a nice, thick chewy texture.  The crust, slightly charred by the coal-fired ovens, was crisp and chewy; the flavors of the sauce, the pools of cheese, and the toppings blended into a deliciously satisfying pizza experience!\n\nWith friendly, efficient service, incredible pizza and Calzones, and five locations in Vegas, Grimaldi's is a five star pizza joint that is now a permanent part of my Sin City rotation.  I enjoyed this visit so much that I just may check out the Mother Ship when next I return to the Big Apple."

The thin crust hits the spot and surprisingly does something that seemingly no other pizza place in town attempts - the New York pizza.  The large pizza and a large salad is enough to feed 3 hungry men, so don't feel like you have to buy a ton of food. The environment is nice, but therein lies the rub with Grimaldi's.  With the nice environment comes the vibe of \"upscale\" eatery, along with the high price tag.  Which brings me to my 3-star review.  I don't care how good pizza is, it's pizza.  There's no reason that a person should spend $25 on a pizza (plus tip). So yes, I finally found a place in Vegas with good New York style pizza, but unfortunately, the pizza is too expensive to enjoy frequently enough to really care. Our final price came to about $40 with a large salad, large pizza, and two soft drinks, just to give you an idea.  It's a good pizza, and definitely worth a try, but the prices on the menu are outrageous."

Our bartender/server was very personable and nice. Thank god there was beer. We had a large with pepperoni and mushrooms. $35 for a pizza and two beers....I'd rather grate off my nipples with a cheese grater than rush back here any time soon.

Given the opportunity, I tried their relatively new Fashion Show Mall location during our staycation.\n  Grimaldi' s obviously has fans. At 2 p.m., there was a ten minute wait. And they are putting up a new Grimaldi's caddy corner across Las Vegas Boulevard in the Pallazo.\n  With a fashion show taking place, in the vicinity of Gramaldi's, the wait was not boring. When the tables are all occupied, they hand you a beeper resembling a pizza slice. When a table is available, it goes off.\n  I enjoyed my personal thin crusted pizza topped with mushrooms. It seemed to be the equivalent of four slices of standard pizza. The taste and quality are commendable.\n  The negative is they do not sell individual slices of thick crusted pizza. New York pizza that I grew up on.\n  The people that recommended Grimaldi's were right. I am a fan."

Too much to eat in one sitting.  Had to take home the leftovers.  I had a calzone with olives and mushrooms.  It was also cooked well - nice a crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside.  I like that they use ricotta on the inside.  Good tomato sauce to dip.  Two issues - our waiter was also the bartender so he was not always good about coming and checking on us.  The manager had to pitch in a couple of times.  Also, the calzone came out almost 10 minutes after the pizza so I sat there and watched my mom eat for awhile.  I know calzones take longer to cook but we should have been warned about the wait.  Overall good food and I will try it again."

There is a small bar. Also, there is seating al frasco, too. In one corner, there is a round table for a cozy get-together.\n\nThe service is pretty good- the staff is nice and friendly. The atmosphere is nice. It's a little small (but there is also seating at the Bar, and al fresco, too). The pizza is pretty good- thin crust, good sauce, good cheese. My husband & I shared a pie (had leftovers). I think, maybe, my husband (who is half Italian) thought it was good, but not spectacular. At the time, the baby wasn't eating too many solids, so we didn't share our meal with him. Funny story: the baby was having his bottle and he ended up falling asleep at the table, in the highchair.\n \nAbout the Menu, choose the item and size- personal, small, large (pizza, calzone) and then select your toppings (which takes up half the menu- meats, veggies, extra sauce, basil, garlic, etc.). If you get any starters, it's several choices of salads. Also has desserts, cold drinks, and wine & beer.\n\nI'm curious about the calzones. I could order it for pickup. I would definitely try this place again."

If we wanted any of those items we simply would've ordered them. We were not asked once to order these items but twice. This is a pizza joint yet it really felt like going to an Olive Garden where one is pressured to buy an appetizer, cocktail, or dessert in order to jack up the bill. Ridiculous. \n\nNow, the pizza.  The pizza was mediocre at best and certainly not up to snuff at the other Grimaldi's location we've been too. Ordered large sausage pie but it was really light on the sauce and the cheese. I actually like sauce all over my pie and cheese as well but the cook just drizzled on the sauce and then filled in the gaps with cheese. In other words the entire pizza was not covered with sauce or cheese. Also they usually put a decent amount of fresh basil on their pizzas but not this time. Maybe two small pieces of basil on an entire large pie? Very disappointing and as a result of my wife and I will not be back to this location. \n\nI guess we will pay a couple bucks more and tryout Dom Demarco's across town. my wife did order the homemade tiramasu to go and she said it was pretty good. It was 5 dollars. 1 other strange thing even know this is a sit down restaurant it does not have bathrooms??? That was also a pretty serious turn off for us."

Forget about the food court overflowing with 2 star options.  There's Neiman Marcus with its own restaurant, and places like Maggianos and The Capital Grille too, but those are obviously in a different price range with a totally different experience.\n\nHere, I got a personal pizza (12 inches) that starts at a $9 price point, then goes up a couple bucks depending on what toppings you add.  I think that this size could actually be shared among 2 people if you wanted to.  It's thin and saucy, and the portion of cheese to crispy crust is well balanced.\n\nIt's a cute little place, I sat at the bar but looked around at the brick walls, the fireplace, all the photos, and of course the red and white checkered tablecloths.  So it's not just some impersonal generic pizza joint in a mall.\n\nWhen I think of Grimaldi from this point forward, instead of Morocon royalty instantly coming to mind, I think it's just as likely I'll be thinking of some pizza."

Quality pizza, good food, but probably wouldn't come back again."

The meal was great but the crust was a  little thin for my tastes.\n\nThe atmosphere was great. A quiet, almost calming place. One of the first songs was \"Hello Dolly\" by Louis Armstrong. Very nice change of pace. \n\nThe service was pretty standard.\n\nBottom line, if your shopping at the Fashion Show Mall, and want a bite to eat for lunch.

I was with my parents and brothers, we decided pizza sounded good. The hostess sat us without a smile. We asked what beers that had on draught and without even answering she just pointed at the black book in the middle of the table that listed beers and specials and walked away.\n\nWe looked over the menu (our first time to Grimaldi's) and discovered that there's only pizza and salads. For a large pizza with no toppings it starts at $16, each topping is $2+. More expensive than I had anticipated, especially with picky little boys. We started discussing going somewhere more kid-friendly for my brothers. The server came up and you could see the disappointment of ending up with a family at her table. Fashion Show caters to tourists and people willing to drop a lot of dough, so she probably sized us up as cheap and not good tippers.\n\nNo smile. No greeting. We gave our drink orders at first, but her attitude really killed any desire for me to be there. I am a FOOD & BEVERAGE SUPERVISOR, all I deal with is customer service all day long. Her obvious disdain made me get up and ask her to cancel our drinks. She said, \"Oh.\" in the most lackluster way possible and walked away from us. That's it! I was personally insulted. I'm sorry my family didn't measure up to your expectations, but we were ready and willing to eat, drink, and tip well. Grimaldi's will not get my business again, not for high prices and poor service."

First the pizza maker forgot the added cheese so the addition was taken off our bill. The salid was excellent and was the best part of our dinning experience. Nancy asked for a berry sangria that had one strawberry sliced up and 6 blueberries. We were told that one strawberry was normal so we asked for an additional strawberry so we received one strawberry slice. Hum........cheap! The berry sangria was about 7 bucks. Don't throw away your hard earned money on this drink.\nSo, we have been to this (Fashon show) location and to the Summerlin location. Summerlin is much better."

We got the basic margherita pizza with the famous tomato sauce and basil. It is the simplest pizza you can get but it allows you to focus on taste of the crust and the sauce. I recommend just getting a large for your best value and leftovers pizza is always good. I honestly would like a lot of toppings but they really add up and I would have a $30 plus pizza.

You may want to ask for someone else. I usually don't name employees who gave bad service in my reviews, but this guy made me angry! We came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was perfect timing because we had just missed the lunch rush and it wasn't as crowded. After the hostess showed us to our table, we waited for 15 minutes until our server finally showed up. What annoyed me was that there was another couple that was sitting right next to us and arrived after we did. Yet, they got serviced by Jilani first. A few minutes later, I overheard the hostess telling him that we came in first and have been waiting for a while. Thank you for actually noticing. He obviously sucks at keeping track of his tables. Finally, he stops by our table. No \"Hello\" or \"Welcome,\" just \"What would you like to order?\" We pretty much didn't see him until paying for our bill. Other servers, who were much more friendly, brought us our drinks and food. 2 starts for them! Jilani did not care to check on us while we were eating, nor did he offer to refill our drinks. After we were done, we waited for another 15 minutes until he finally showed up again and asked \"You want me to box that?\" No, I'm going to spend the rest of the day here staring at my 3 slices of leftover pizza. What do you think?! A few minutes later, he dropped off the pizza and bill without saying a word. I don't even know why I left him a tip. Although it was much less that what I would have left for a good server. \n\nFood: 4 Stars.\nNot the best tasting pizza I have eaten, but still pretty good. I don't know if I came here on a off day, but my pepperoni pizza was a bit salty. I do like their crispy thin crust and fresh ingredients.

They also give you a free pizza on your birthday.\n\nHoping for better service the next time around!"

The pizza was insanely bland.  The sauce was really lacking in flavor, spice, and salt and moreover, the whole thing just kind of tasted like bread, to be honest.\n\nHere's what they did RIGHT: the crust (although the flavor was just okay) was the PERFECT amount of crunchy.   It was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and had the structural integrity to hold up the toppings.  The spicy chicken sausage and my salad were both good, but it didn't compensate for the overall lack of flavor in the pizza.\n\nMy advice?  Go to Secret Pizza in the Cosmo.

It is essentially an $18 coupon for a large pizza! \n\nThis essentially gets you a large one topping, or a large white with garlic, and you pay for additional toppings or anything else above and beyond!\n\nI enjoy Grimaldi's charcoal style ovens, which add a nice flavor to the super thin crust and toppings. The pepperoni and sausage combo was a bit on the greasy end, but a little grease is a good thing!  The white pizza is amazing, with chunks of garlic hiding in there!\n\nService was pretty slow during lunchtime at the bar.  They only had one server for the entire bar area, AND she had tables in the dining area.  Not a huge deal to me since I wasn't in a hurry that day, but keep it in mind in case this wasn't an \"off\" day for them.\n\nI'll be back at some point, but for sure next year for my birthday!"

They have a variety of toppings, so we built our own (onion, garlic, spinach, jalapeno and Italian sausage). The toppings were OK, but the sauce and crust are what makes it. Our large 18\" came out to @ $30, which is a bit pricey, but not having many chances to eat pizza of this quality in HI, it was definitely worth it. I would definitely come back if I didn't have to fly 6 hours to do it."

Pesto, White (garlic and cheese) and sausage and pepperoni  (cuz Dre hate veggie pizza). \n\nService was slowwwww. In fact they messed up our order, however they were extremely courteous about it that we got the original order as well as 2 small ones and 1 extra large for a total of 6 Pizzas! \n\nPizza was pretty good, I wouldnt say the best but still good and the fact they gave us extra helps.

They do have a back table that can seat a party of 8.

The service was good, but unfortunately slow....forgotten beer orders and the waiter didn't come to our table till about 10 minutes after our arrival...crickets, crickets, crickets.\n\nWe ordered three Large pizza - White, Pesto, and Pepperoni with Sausage( enough for 8) and a Large Cesar Salad (enough for 4, good portions). This restaurant is not stingy and I love it! Our order was sadly mixed up, so they sent out some pizza for us to nibble on before our actual orders came. Thank you Grimaldi's!\n\nMy favorite pizza was their Pesto Pizza. I would have to say that their dough here is the staple of everything...so light and crisp! I could eat a whole personal pizza by myself!!! Their pizza is on the lighter side of things, not overwhelming with toppings and flavors. Simple, but good!\n\nThe White Pizza was okay for me; I'm a little bias from Secret Pizza's White Pizza from Cosmopolitan, sorry!  The Pepperoni pizza with Sausage was delicious, where I actually enjoyed the sausages more than the pepperoni. Weird, I know...\n\nThe decor is here is also very traditional sticking with the New York theme with lots of cool pics posted on the walls.

I ordered the Caprese salad, and he got a large White pizza, with half sausage.\nThe salad, which was slices of tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves, was alright. The cheese was different from other mozzarella I've had; I don't know if it is because of the free range cows it is suppose to comes from, or if I am use to some other type. It was an alright salad, the tomatoes weren't very tasty, but hey, they're out of season now.\nThe pizza wasn't great. It wasn't good either, it was just, well, there. Again, the cheese on it was different, it seriously looks like the vegan cheese from Pop Up Pizza, but it's not.  We had garlic and tomatoes on the whole pie, and it was meh. My boyfriend said the sausage was good, but it cost 3$ to add it to the pizza. He had wanted chicken at first, but then saw it was 5$! Every add on for pizza is 2-5! That's outrageous for the quality and quantity that you get!  I really don't know why people think this is the greatest pizza EVER, but maybe we need to go back and try one with sauce. Maybe that's the best part, I don't know, but I really didn't care for it. It was all very bland (you can't taste any garlic on the pizza, and the cheese leaves an aftertaste) and it gets pricey if you want add ons."

So, based on the featured \"coal-burning\" oven, it was a must-try.\n\nThe place is a pretty cool retro-modern looking, table-and-chair, checkered tablecloth, cloth napkin eatery with available(? we weren't asked if we wanted to sit outside) al fresco seating, open kitchen, and full-service? bar. I liked the \"renewable\" wine bottle chande-lights.\n\nFor the three of us, we ordered a Large Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza, a Personal Mushroom pizza, and the Antipasto, which I HAD TO TRY because of the \"house-made\" Fresh Mozzarella. The Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza was pretty good. Good sauce, adequate amount of topping, and a crisp crust, although it did have a somewhat disturbing amount of char on the bottom of it. The mushroom pizza, in my opinion, was a bit scant on one of the most inexpensive of toppings. The Antipasto was quite good, consisting of olives,  oven-roasted red peppers, Genoa salami, fresh mozzarella, and sliced bread. The winner on that plate was the \"house-made\" fresh mozzarella, with the sweet oven-roasted red peppers making a good accompaniment on the sliced bread with the salami and cheese. Oh, and a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar (from the leaky bottle)! \n\nThe service could use some work, as our waiter was kinda lost. First, messing up a simple one diet coke, one regular coke, one iced tea order, bringing two regular cokes instead and blaming it on the dispenser. Whuh? And nowhere to be found when we were ready to pay our check. He also screwed up our neighboring tables' pizza order, leaving one of three women sitting there watching her friends eat their pizza while hers was re-ordered. And I don't think they put a rush on it. Having back-of-the-house experience, her order should have been re-made \"on-the-fly\", meaning  it should have been made top priority.\n\nAside from the little snags, I would definitely go back to try the Caprese salad and some other pizza combinations."

Not your typical pizza. the cheeses used are different and less common on this side of the world (I guess lol)... it was almost like goat cheese. The crust texture was very nice. Very garlic-kee... (which I liked). Not sure that Id return, but had a great experience. the staff was all smiles, happy, and nice. pricing was very reasonable for the strip.

There are three pizzas to choose from in a large or small and then you can choose your own toppings.\n\nMy friend and I just ordered a mushroom pizza to split and a caprese salad.\n\nThe salad was good, but I can't imagine how you'd go wrong making that. They give you salt, oil, and balsamic on the side. It was a good portion and shareable at $8. \n\nOur pizza was served shortly after.\n\nThe woman served our first slice and we ate the whole large between the two of us.\n\nThe crust is very thin, the cheese was very good, the mushrooms were fresh, and the sauce was just right.\n\nIt was a very good pizza. They found a very good recipe for their proportions and ratios of cheese versus sauce versus crust.\n\nThe only thing that didn't make this a 5 star review is that:\n\n1. They never refilled our drinks until we asked when leaving. Sure he offered a to go cup, but it want busy because he had a bite of food from an off the clock employee's food while he was on the clock but that's beside the point.\n2. A customer leaving broke a wine glass just by putting his jacket on. Although they handled the situation well to make the customer not feel at fault.. They said don't worry it happens all the time.. First they shouldn't keep wine glasses on the table no matter how nice it makes the table setting look since their tables are so close together. Second the staff said it happens all the time and not to worry. It just feels dangerous, uncomfortable for who ever did it, and could be avoided. I hope it doesn't happen all the time for safety reasons.  \n\nI'd return to try their special mozzarella and meats on a more adventurously topped pizza, but maybe not this location."

The day we were in Las Vegas happened to be our 9 year olds bday and he wanted pizza. I know there are other probably better pizza places in town but we happened to be in the Fashion mall where he found his bday legos couple stores down in the Lego Store so we popped in here to try out Grimaldi's. I know it's a chain restaurant but we don't have it in town.\n\nFirst off its not a huge place. Its opened so you can see out and right in front is where they periodically do fashion shows so if you sit outside you get up see that if you don't mind the blaring music and singing for a bit. Inside it's nice and cozy with leather booths against the huge mirror.\n\nWe got seated, had a nice waiter yet a bit gruff but I can tell he's just busy and trying to attend to us all. We misheard him while ordering and he was a bit shocked we thought he put down the wrong order. It got a bit uncomfty for awhile lol. It was our first time so it would be nice to have some more patience with us bc yes we were indecisive bc the pizzas all looked so good but our kids had so much opinions :/ so we finally settled on 2 large make your own pizzas but realized we could have gotten a better deal going with a fully loaded specialty one but when I went up to ask if he put in the order he already did. That's ok totally our bad. Wish we had more time to look and decide. Just felt a bit rushed n not sure why. \nAnyways the pizza was delicious, perfect thinness. They cut n serve for you. They also graciously gave the bday boy a bday cannoli :) sweet of them.\n\nAll in all, not bad. Just a bit odd an experience with the service. Pizza was great. Price ok not the cheapest but ok for a mall restaurant in LV. We were content and just right, not full full. Had fun so thank you!"

My verdict: Good pizza, but not worth going out of your way to try it if you're on vacation here. \n\nI split a large Brooklyn Bridge pizza - a pie with tomato base, ricotta cheese, red peppers, and hand-picked Italian sausage - with a couple of friends. The first few bites were delicious, and I really enjoyed the ricotta cheese, which was sweet, creamy, and rich. After settling in, though, I found the ricotta a little bit too heavy and overpowering, so I would suggest splitting a pie two-ways for variety. Lastly, the crust nice and crispy on the edges, but extremely soggy in the middle. Don't expect too much from Grimaldi's, but still a solid slice of pizza for the price."

They do make their own desserts including cheese cake and have a selection of wine and cocktails, as well as some salads. We enjoyed our simple Marg pizza. There are plenty of topping options (for and additional $2-$5 each) so you could easily build your own $50 pizza! We kept it simple which worked well with the thin NYC style crust. I have a hard time believing that this Grimaldi's equals the NYC location that has lines for days; we enjoyed our pizza but not enough to wait hours for it!

The rest aka toppings? That, my friend, is entirely up to you! You can choose to be a minimalist or go big with whatever toppings you would like. I ended up getting a classic red with Italian sausage, garlic, mushroom, and green peppers.

My cousin chose pepperoni and sausage for his pizza, and I chose to top mine with mushrooms, chicken, artichokes, and peppers. Both pizzas were awesome.\n\nCaprese Salad: They definitely don't skimp on the cheese and tomatoes here, which were served in thick slices. As much as I love tomatoes, the cheese was the star of that dish.  \n\nCalzone: I'm not a huge fan of calzones; the one's I ate in the past were just ok, but these were freaking good! If I can recall correctly, the calzone was stuffed with cheese, artichoke hearts, and sausage. \n\nCaesar Salad: Not much to say about the salad except that it wasn't drenched in dressing. It wasn't bad, and I might order it again.\n\nSERVICE\nSo service is a little slow. During my first visit, my family and I waited about five minutes for our waiter to show up and take our drink orders, then another 10 minutes to take our food orders. Despite this, our waiter did come by to our table often to refill our beverages, checked to see how our meals were, and he even talked and joked around with us for a minute.  On my second visit, service was a bit faster. I guess it depends on what time of day you visit.\n\nOVERALL\nI'll probably make another stop to Grimaldi's sometime in the future, since it's changed my viewpoint on eating pizza at the mall."

Not particularly by choice, but my mom worked there and irresponsibly (love ya mom!) brought home those lovely grease filled, cheese and meat covered circles of dough to my family nearly every other day.   Anytime I was hungry, Pizza Hut pizza was waiting for me in the fridge and I developed a dependency to my pan pizza friends.  Fast forward 20 something years and Pizza Hut was still my pie of choice over Dominos, Papa John's, etc.  I dug Metro Pizza, CPK, and others, but not until I had Grimaldi's did the wool finally get pulled from my eyes.\n\n(begin food review)\n\nOH THE CRUST!   I'd never had authentic NY pizza prior to Grimaldis (I'm sure there's some New Yorker reading this right now shaking their head due to their belief of what real NY Pizza is.   To them I say:  no one cares).   Once you go coal blackened, you never go back.   Every pizza I've had since has paled in comparison (here's looking at you Settebello).   I like every type of pizza you can get here.  The Regular with some Pepperoni is simple and delicious.  The White with Garlic and Anchovies.  The Pesto.  no, THE PESTO.  My absolute favorite.  Pesto with Pepperoni and Meatball with some jalapenos on the side.  Absolute perfection.   I typically eat the Eastern location which I find the most consistently good, though I did try the Fashion Show one a few nights ago and found it just as good on that one visit.  Ingredients tasted fresh, crust was that perfect nearly chewy texture.  Several calories were devoured that night.\n\nOne other shout out: the bartender that was working that night was fantastic.  I sat at the bar for about half an hour waiting for a friend and he made one of the best double jack and cokes I'd had in a while.  I had several throughout the night (note to reader: this may or may not have influenced my food review).   I dont remember his name, but the next time you're in the Fashion Show and need a buzz before you get lost in the 20 floors of Forever 21, swing by Grimaldis with $10.50."

They don't offer many food choices. salad, pizza, and that's pretty much it, but their pizza is my favorite. I am always torn between the white pizza with meatballs or the pesto pizza with meatballs. they both just make my mouth water. mmm\nthis location also serves alcohol and has a bar. great for after work or after a day of shopping till you're dropping in the fashion show mall. I LOVE their red sangria.\nIt is def worth stopping in if you are staying on the strip or shopping in the mall."

Grimaldi's showed up on my Yelp app, so we decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad we did!  We had a large pizza with pepperoni and black olives ($18) and a personal-sized pesto pizza ($10).  It was more than enough food for the four of us, plus 6 leftover slices, and we were all starving.  Those 6 slices sure came in handy when we staggered back from the club 6 hours later... :)  The pizza was outstanding.  It was thin-crust and had real slices of fresh mozzarella (you can tell when you see the round blobs on the pizza rather than the uniform coating that most commercial pizzas have) and deliciously salty pepperoni.  The black olives were a little too salty for some of us, so we would probably sub those out next time for something else.  The quality of the pizza was definitely right for the price.\n\nI called ahead and walked over to Fashion Show Mall from TI (about 10-15 minutes), and our order was ready when we got there.  (HINT: it's all the way at the \"back\" of the mall by Dillard's in Zone D on the lower floor, near Chipotle).  The lady on the phone and the server who rang us up were both very nice, and the ambiance of the restaurant is very cute and intimate, so I would definitely come back to eat in as well.  If you are looking for a fast, inexpensive and tasty meal for a group, give this place a try!"

It truly is a very bad experience when you get better service at Auntie Anne's ...

I still dream about NYC pizza 4 years after my visit there (I couldn't eat California pizza for 6 months afterward; it just made me angry) so I'm a little skeptical of anything this far from the east coast. \n\nIt's a small restaurant inside of a mall, and gets crowded quickly. We were a party of 7. You can see the fashion shows from the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered a large white pizza, a large pesto, and a large meat pizza, along with a large Caesar salad. The salad was perfect. Not for the health-conscious with the amount of dressing used, but perfect. The they started bringing us small pizzas. We told the server that we had ordered 3 larges, and since the pizzas took so long to make, the manager told us to go ahead and keep them on the house and they would bring out the larges. The 3 large pizzas were more than enough alone to feed our table, so we had sooooo much extra pizza. They also accidentally brought an extra large meat pizza, but told us to keep that one as well!\n\nI wish the rest of our visit was just as great. Before and after the pizzas were dropped off, we were completely ignored. I had to ask three times for another beer because it was forgotten, there were empty water glasses, etc. Maybe they could somehow tell I had too much beer over the weekend and didn't need anymore, but still!\n\nThe pizza was good, but didn't blow me away like the NYC version had. They did a great job on the crispy crust. The pesto was my favorite, the white pizza was too garlickly, and none of them seemed cheesy enough. It didn't have that life-changing, holy-crap-I-am-moving-to-NY like other pizzas I've had, but it was still good. \n\nCould have been a 5-star experience if the pizza and service were a little better!

We ordered the mushroom and they scattered the pie with some shaved very thin.  They use about a tablespoon of tomato sauce and about the same amount of a tasteless cheese.   Dominos has better pizza.  And it's expensive.  I'm from Los Angeles and every place here is better."

We went to Grimaldi's for a late lunch one day and I was very impressed!\n\nThere are plenty of choices for toppings and you can choose some of the specialty pizzas as well. There are also some appetizers and desserts.\n\nWe started with a Caesar salad which was fantastic. It was flavorful and they even grated fresh pepper on top for you.\n\nThe pizza is made in a brick oven and you can see them put them in and take them out - the oven can hold quite a few pizzas! The time to receive the pizza was very reasonable and it was delicious! We opted to get half with just pepperoni and then the other half with jalape\u00f1os and bacon (not my choice lol) but it was still fantastic! We weren't able to finish the entire pizza so we ended up taking a few slices home for leftovers.\n\nWe ended the meal with a cannoli which was also amazing. The shell was crunchy and the filling was rich and creamy. I highly recommend the restaurant!"

Who knew this fossil fuel could help produce heavenly bites of pizza?!\nI went at lunch time and was promptly sat at the bar. The place is a little small so I can imagine the wait time at peak hours can be long. The bartender was nice and since it was my first time, he explained the menu and how the pizza is made. I decided on a personal 12\" pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and kalmata olives.  I waited about 20 minutes until the food arrived, which isn't bad for lunch. Yumm the smell of the pizza was divine! My first bite overtook my senses. Explosions of flavor all around my mouth, crunchy, gooey, saucy, melty goodness!! I quickly ate about 6 pieces in no time flat. I decided to take a breather before I was knocked into a pizza coma. As I was paying for my check, the two gentleman sitting next to me at the bar asked if they could have my 2 left over slices while they waited for their order......yes people the pizza is that good that strangers will ask for your leftovers!!\n\nI have become a believer! Grimaldi's is hands down the best pizza I have ever had! This says a lot because I spent 6 months in Italy and thought nothing in the US would be able to compare, but I was wrong. Grimaldi's is the shizzz!"
