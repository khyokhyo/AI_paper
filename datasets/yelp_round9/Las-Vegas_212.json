            "review": "This place deserves 5 stars based on these 3 things:\n\n1. AFFORDABLE PRICE: My parents, sister and I visited this place on a Sunday night while visiting Vegas for the weekend.  We ordered soup, pad thai, chicken larb, seafood salad, stuffed chicken wings, sticky rice, thai tea and thai iced coffee.  The total bill was $64!!!  $64 for a complete meal with soup, appetizers, sticky rice, drinks and noodles is pretty dang good!  Not only that, but the dishes weren't dinky and were plentiful!  The Thai Tea and Thai Iced Coffee also came in huge glasses. So much that my parents didn't finish their drinks and had to take it to go.  I'm used to a very fat bill with small portions every time I visit a Thai restaurant back home in California, so $64 looked great to us.\n\n2. GREAT FOOD:  Not only was the place very affordable for a Thai Restaurant, but it was amazingly delicious.  BEST CHICKEN LAAB/LARB I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! (From a restaurant, that is.  I still think Mom & Bro-in-law makes the best larb in the world).  It was a perfect combination of salty and sour.  I find that some restaurants make it too salty or don't add enough of that larb stuff..... rice powder/toasted rice powder.  I immediately tasted a hint of rice powder and asked my mom if she did too... just to confirm it.  They also added just enough cilantro and greens to add that fresh herb taste to it.  Everything was in perfect unison.  It was just damn PERFECT!\n\nEverything else was great; Tom Yum Soup was flavorful, seafood salad was fresh, pad thai was also delicious and the sticky rice was heaven!  It was kept in a bamboo warmer and had that home quality taste just like the way Grandmas makes sticky rice.\n\nWe ordered a 4 spicy on a scale of 1-10 and it was just perfect.  It was pretty spicy for a 4, but it was just about right.  We got our pepper kick without totally burning off our tongues.  I come from a family that eats spicy food, so I recommend asking for 3 or lower if you can't really take the heat.  \n\n3.  GREAT SERVICE:  I was put in charge of searching for restaurants to go to during our trip, so initially, I was thinking about taking my parents to a more fancier, \"Best Thai Restaurant in the Country\" place.  But last minute, I decided on Archie's because of the reviews that stated this place was a small, family owned restaurant.  Knowing my parents' preference and my own as well, I knew we would enjoy the food and atmosphere of a small restaurant.  The 2 waitresses were super friendly and often checked back on our tables to see if we needed anything else.  They also came back around to refill our water twice.\n\nThe only negative about Archie's is that it's away from the strip.  It's not too far, but its a few miles.  Also, the restaurant is located on a very dark shopping center.   The shopping center was deserted and.... kinda creepy."

It always tastes fresh and delicious and flavorful every time I have it. \n\nOther favorites are pad prik king (they do not skimp on the ginger, which makes it even more delicious), pineapple fried rice (probably my favorite pineapple fried rice ever. They add curry or something that makes it different and more flavorful than others), and their curries. \n\nThere's a reason why this place is one of my family's to go place when we go out to eat, because their food is consistently good and delicious. \n\nIt's definitely one of those places in Vegas that I like to go to every time I visit. \n\nAlso, I love that they have a drive thru window when you get your food to go. It's perfect for lazy people like me."

I usually order the eggplant spicy with tofu because it feels like I'm getting more food, though it's delicious with the beef, too. \n\nYou also order your food based on how spicy you want it...  \"Spicy number 4,\" my dining companion might say to the waiter. \n\nI think the spiciness levels depend on who's in the back cooking that day, but go for spicy number 7. Ask for the spice caddy if your spice level isn't enough. \n\nWhat else....  The panang and the other curries are very good, too. The only time I have been disappointed with my experience at Archi's is when I ordered the Thai pancake. It looks better than it tastes, trust me. Period."

That was Wednesday, today is Sunday and she still has nausea and feels terrible. taking a anti-nausea over the counter medicine the pharmacist recommended. My parents traveled to Las Vegas to celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary from Denver. The vacation has been ruined because we choose to eat at Archi's.  This morning she ate a piece of toast we hope she will feel good enough to travel Tuesday."

I had the $10 pad thai which was okay and my friend had something which he said was ok.  The portion sizes were huge as neither of us could finish our respective dish.  \n\nIf I had gone to Archi's for a lunch special I'd rate them 4-stars as the food's fine, restaurant decor nice and service friendly.  Otherwise I'd say they're average for a Vegas Thai eatery."

The decoration or theme makes you feel as if you're in someones house and the seats are very comfortable.  Good service and a nice clean restaurant.\n\nNow as far as the food goes, Archi's is one of the best thai food in Vegas.  Everything is good but my favorite, which I also recommend is the spicy eggplant (you have an option of which meat you'd like too add on it). There pad thai is is great too but the one in asian thai cuisine is slightly better, but still delicious nonetheless. \n\nI recommend this Archi's over the other one because of its interior theme and comfortable eating.  It gets pretty busy during the evening so I suggest coming in the early afternoons so you can enjoy the food in peace."

I placed my order on the phone and the lady said \"OK, see you in 15 minutes at the drive-thru window,\" that got me super excited!!! I wouldn't have to get outta my car in my stinky, bacteria infested work clothes, turn my car off, turn my car on, waste more gas... bla bla bla.. Yeah, the drive-thru really got my blood pumping.\n\nUpon getting there, I almost passed it. I saw the drive-thru easily, but I wondered how anyone could eat inside?? Looked so tiny.. Maybe I will have to discover that at a later time.  \n\nI got my green curry, #6 spicy home, and it was still piping hot after my 30 min drive. Archi's definitely does not skimp out on the content in their curry, plenty of chicken, plenty of bamboo shoots, basil, and plenty of zucchini(which is the first I have had in my curry.. yumm). And they give you just enough rice:] \n\nNot a complaint, I was a happy girl with my curry take out. So, why not 5 stars? Because it's not. Yay! I'm a fan. We will keep it as that."

My man and I were searching for a different place to go and decided on Archi's since we were not far away. Not sure how they did it, but these folks nailed the \"cozy living room.\" Most tables are part booth, part chair, but all of them are comfortable and the lighting really adds to this resto's intimacy. Determined not to get our Thai standards, we opted for the silver noodles salad (sans chicken) -- which was an absolute stand-out, and the curry fried rice with crab meat (salivation central!!) Not so great were the seafood omelet (though the sauce that came w/ was delish!) and the eggplant with shrimp dish (while everything was properly cooked, the dish was super-duper bland -- my man and I were brainstorming things to add to spice this bad boy up!) Will I come back again? Absolutely!! Love this resto's ambiance and that they're mixing it up by offering folks more menu options than what the average thai place offers. Service is fantastic, with folks constantly checking up to make sure you're enjoying your meal.  Final plus: they stick to their guns on the spice level factor.  If you order a 5 of 10 on the spicy scale, expect to get exactly that!"

But, for the most part it was not as bad as I thought it to be. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered chicken satay with cucumber salad. The chicken skewers were huge but when I bit into them it was mostly fried and dark meat which I didn't really like. At first, it was good but then the grease got to me. The cucumber salad helped with that and I had some of my sister's rice which was very flavorful for white rice. Her husband ordered a shrimp curry that looked really good. He said it was good but not as good as this other Thai place in Chicago. The place was set up really nice considering it was in a strip mall.

Great Pad Thai, Curry, Fried Rice, and sweet and sour pork.  The dinner prices are average but the lunch specials are great.  For $8 you can have the soup of the day, a spring roll, salad and your meal which is a very large portion.\n\nThe only inconsistency is the service.  Most days the service is friendly and fast but on an occasional busy lunch, the service can be slow and you may find yourself feeling unwanted.  I caution going to Archi's at exactly 12 noon.\n\nOther than that one complaint, Archi's is near the top of the Las Vegas Thai food scene."

Pork requires longer cook time than beef/chicken so the meat gets infused with the seasoning.  Chicken was good, but pork was better.   I like my spicy basil dish dry, not wet, and for the most part, Archi's does make the dish dry.  A wet dish means it wasn't cook long enough to infuse the meat with the flavors.  Unfortunately, the dish is inconsistently cook (sometimes wet and not as flavorful) so removing one star.\n\nThe other dishes that I tried were ok, but I didn't try many because I almost always got my favorite dish.\n\nNote that the restaurant sign outside does not light up \"Archi's\", only \"Thai Kitchen\".  So when you are looking for it in the dark, concentrating on finding a restaurant named Thai Kitchen because the Archi's is invisible.  Parking is plentiful out front (strip mall).  \n\nThe restaurant inside is warm and comfortable.  Service is very friendly."

In my opinion, this old restaurant has set the standard for Thai restaurants that stay moderately authentic, while at the same time appeal to the general public.  In my opinion, Archi's is a solid Thai restaurant, but it lacks the uniqueness and higher level of authentic Thai that I look for in a Thai restaurant.  \n\nMy Thai friend who is a cook told me that Archi's has good stir fries, but forget about the curries.  So, I thought I would try both.  We ordered the Thai tea, which was excellently balanced with sweetness and cream, the pad cha cha cha, the panang with chicken, and tom kha with chicken.  Let's start with my favorite dish, the tom kha!\n\nI loved the tom kha (khi)!  It has nice whole shrooms, with basil and a fairly good amount of lime juice, along with other yummy herbs.  The coconut milk was generous, and very creamy.  I think it could have been made a little more sour, since I prefer my khi's to be puckeringly sour!  However, underneath Thai Grill, this has to be one of the best tom kha's I have had.  \n\nNext up is the pad cha cha cha, which is a mixed seafood stir fry dish with a lightly spicy teriyaki sauce, and bamboo shoots.  The teriyaki sauce itself was a little bit on the generic side, but tasty enough to enjoy.  What did wow me though was the freshness of the squid.  It was nice and soft, not chewy at all!  \n\nThe panang, which I have heard was good from different people (and not so good from my Thai cook friend), was in my opinion an excellent version of the standard panang you'll get at any Thai restaurant.  It also reminded me of the chu che salmon at Thai Style Noodle House, but with a little less character.  Overall, it was tasty, but not overly unique.  I still think Thai Grill has the most unique curry flavors to date.  However, compared to other Thai restaurants, this version of the dish has a nice balance between sweetness, coconut milk, and herbs.  \n\nI struggled between three and four stars with this review.  However, Archi's has long been the favorite for a few Thai people I know, but today there are a few better restaurants out there.  For the sake of their history though, and their ability to help make Thai food popular in Las Vegas, I am settling on a four star rating today due to the previously mentioned facts, and that awesome tom kha!"

When they ask you how hot you want it on a scale of 1-10, try going lower than usual because I think they eye ball the spiceyness-touch.  Either that or the cooks have no taste bud because they are hardcore smokers..\n\nIf you don't know where to start try their Panang Curry, Tom Kha (coconut soup), or Pad Kapow. \n\nTheir sister's property on Rainbow is just as consistent as the Flamingo one (original location) just bigger and newer looking.

The meat basically crumbled in my mouth. There was a TON of oil at the bottom of the bowl which suggests two theories, one.... there was too much moisture from the frozen chicken being thawed or two ......they just used a ton of oil to give moisture to the precooked chicken. \nAs far as flavor... It was okay. Had they cooked the chicken fresh, it would have been so much better. I probably won't come back because I know thai places that cook with fresh ingredients."

I got the Thai Chow Mein, the wife got Lard Nar and we both had Thai iced teas. All items were very delicious. The Chow Mein was much lighter than I've had, but loved every bit of it. My only complaint with my dish, was that the tofu was only lightly fried. It was pretty soggy. It had a good flavor, but really would have liked it with a bit more crisp. The wife's lard nar was really good. The noodles were some of the best I've had. The gravy was a bit soupy, more so than other lard nar's we've had. The Thai iced tea was great. Not as sweet as others, which was nice. \nI am excited this place is so close to where we live, as we definitely will be back."

We fly into Vegas once a year for a convention and we are always looking for a great place to eat \"off the strip\". We did Lotus of Siam last year. Archi's has a lot to live up to. Took a $20 cab ride out here. Food is good but not great. Menu is a bit sparse. Green curry was very average. The ginger beef dish was very good and so was the salad and the chicken satay sticks. We don't need a full bar in a restaurant, but they'd probably get more business if they served beer and wine. You cannot buy ANY alcohol here at all so we settled for tea and water. Had to wait forever to get a cab back to the strip. Overall, food is probably a 4 1/2. Location and decor is about a 3 1/2 . Service was very good. Overall, a good restaurant, but nothing special and for the $40 cab ride out and back, we feel the Lotus of Siam has this place beat hands down, due to closer location to strip and much more interesting menu."

I order the beef and then comes the million dollar question:\n\nHow spicy would you like that sir?\n\nThat's so loaded when you're asked that in front of  a bunch of friends.  it's like the 'do these jeans make me look fat' question.  it's complicated.  I like spicy food and at thai places around the bay area, i order med-hot and i can finish my food and enjoy the heat.  Here, they have a scale of 1-10 here so I feel like 7 is pretty safe.  That along with a thai iced tea seemed like a safe choice and then it begins...\n\nthe noodles came out piping hot and it honestly did not look spicy.  there wasn't any chili oil or a bunch of chili flakes.  It looked like a great dish of noodles...until i took my first few bites.  holy hell, the noodles were marinated in devil piss or something.  I could not stop sweating.  halfway through my dish, it looked like i ran a marathon.  beads of sweat running down my cheeks.  The thai iced tea was my life line.  I was a sweating mess by the end and I couldn't finish my food because the heat was too punishing.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food was delicious.  flavor profile was great,  but it was....painful.  minus 1 star for no warning on the heat scale being off the charts.

I almost made myself sick trying to eat it all.. yup, I'm a fatty.\n\nBeef with bell peppers - a much more modestly (read: appropriate!) sized entree. The beef was very high quality for an asian stir fry type beef and the bell peppers were tasty as well. While there's nothing special about this dish, it was of high quality and it seemed to be relatively low calorie if you're eating light. Served with white rice.\n\nAll lunch specials were served with a wonton (seemed to have meat in it? yumm), egg roll (just ok!), and soup of the day. The soup today was chicken coconut soup.

It was very under seasoned for me personally. All I rated in the Panang curry was coconut milk whereas other places I get a more fragrant herbal smell and overpowering taste. Also the chicken was completely over cooked I had to chew on it like it was bubblegum. \n\nAs of returning, this restaurant goes on my maybe list because it is out of my way and I wasn't 80-100% satisfied"

The portion pretty much matched the price and we ate it all up. \n- Spicy Basil - Here they rate their spicy from a level of 1-10 which is probably too much of an array to tell how much spicy you really want. I was with a party of people who couldn't handle their spicy so a 3 was just right for them. \n- Satay - delicious appetizer, serving of 4 so it was the easiest to split.\n- Pad Pak - great choice if you want to get in your veggies with some Thai spice.\n\nOverall, it was worth the trip off the strip for saving some money without giving up great taste. This place does have a lot of space but I'm still very glad that I made reservations because it filled up that night! Service was very friendly and my water never reached the bottom :)"

As for the atmosphere, it has this vintage and inviting feeling like a house! It was nice enough so you didn't feel cramped. I would highly recommended trying the pad thai! Coming from NYC, and having a love for Asian cuisine this is probably one of my top two places. The shaved ice desserts is deceiving because it was not shaved ice. When I think of shaved ice, I think of Malaysian Ais kacang (ABC). This seems more like a type of ice cream but the texture is different from store bought brands. The shaved ice here is some type of ice cream topped with condensed milk and boba! I would still recommended this dish as well. \n\nThe only reason this restaurant did not get five stars was because of the Fresh Springs Rolls. Fresh Springs Rolls reminds me a lot like sushi.The steamed rice paper that wrapped the other sides is unable to hold all the other ingredients. When you pick it up everything falls apart making it very hard to eat."

When I don't get soup, the Pork Satay with peanut sauce is usually my alternate choice. The satay is the best I've ever had because of its tender, large chunks of meat, and the peanut dipping sauce. \n\nHe usually gets the Pad Kapow (pork) and the Pad Thai (chicken). They are excellent.\n\nMy favorite dessert in the summer is their fresh imported mangos with sticky rice and coconut milk. \n\nThey add spices according to your liking and tolerance level. I like my food a little spicy - but not hot. A three is perfect for me in the summer and a four in the winter. He usually gets a level 10, and I usually watch as he drools and eats packets of sugar. \n\nI enjoy their Jasmine hot tea, the excellent service, clean restaurant, and atmosphere.

We started with the fresh spring rolls, and ordered pineapple fried rice w/ shrimp, spicy eggplant (which they label as eggplant spicy) w/ tofu, pad pak w/ chicken, and the pad kapow w/ beef. \n\nTo start, the spring rolls were rolled with a non traditional rice sheet, and were not made with the usual ingredients. Even the peanut sauce seemed a bit lacking. The spicy eggplant had just enough grease to make it delish, and the fried rice was to die for. I barely touched the pad pak, and almost steered clear of the pad kapow - like eating mashed up beef patties. Despite the less favorable dishes, I am still craving me some Archi's!"

Short of having spectacular food, that's about as much as you can ask for in a Thai restaurant.  \n\nAll of their locations are pleasantly decorated, but the Village Square branch is bigger and more modern in its setting.  I find Thai restaurants to have generally pleasant service overall, but I think Archi's goes even a step beyond that.  Their food is at least good, with some great dishes.  I'm partial to the Thai Toast, a must have appetizer in my book.  It's a flavorful meat \"stuffed\" onto toast slices, served with cucumber & onion salad.  LOVE this dish.  Their papaya salad and beef salad are also very good.  For main dishes, I like all their curry dishes and the spicy basil dish, and you can't go wrong with their pad thai.\n\nUnless you find that spectacular Thai place, this is the place where you will not be disappointed and can find some great surprises.  There's a reason why this chain is so popular and continues to expand.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  I went to lunch at the Flamingo location and there were several people eating alone.  So it's at least good for lunch, and I think it will be okay for dinner as well.  Atmosphere isn't intimidating so I don't think it will feel too awkward."

Tonight was a bit busy and I observed not enough server. When I ready to order, the server came and asked me what I want, I just want to point the food name on the menu and show it to her, I was checked the name where is it, just 2 second, she asked me \" are you ready to order?\" Asked me two times, I feel not good, like they push you to hurry up. After that, she left a couple moment when I ordered and she said nothing like\" I'll be back.\" I work in restaurant too, I really understand when is busy, everyone will become crazy. I mean your restaurant is very good, the location, decoration and the food is awesome. But if can more friendly it will be more more awesome for the whole image.  I will come back next time, I hope I can see the different because I really love this restaurant!!"

I had the Cashew Nut with tofu, spicy level 7 (on a scale of 1-10).  There weren't many customers in the restaurant, so my food came very quickly, probably in less than five minutes.  The portions were of a decent size, but they were a little too liberal with the onion.  The whole dish was basically covered in onion.  It's like they chopped up an entire onion and put it on my food.  I didn't mind because I'm fine with onions, but for most people it might be a little much.  \n\nThe wait staff was very friendly.  I'm not a very bossy person so they don't really have to do much for me.  \n\nOverall, a decent meal, decent portions, at a good price."

Unlike most Thai places, when you ask for spicy they give it to you on the Thai scale rather than the 'yeah right, whitey' scale, which I've come to recognize as a mark of respect. The service was always terrible and the place is tiny, but the heavenly food makes up for these mortal flaws.\n\nI know this constitutes blasphemy, but in terms of vegetarian Thai food I think Archi's holds its own against Lotus of Siam."

My boyfriend was stationed in Thailand so he is verrrrry picky. I am on my way home from work and decide I'm going to call in an order. So i call and order the spicy eggplant with pork (recommended by the girl on the phone) an order of Thai wontons and an iced Thai coffee. I show up in 15 minutes and wait for maybe about 5. Service is amazing. So friendly and sweet. Gosh that's hard to find in Las Vegas. She brings out my iced coffee and I'm in love. It's so yummy. I believe it's made with condensed milk which is why it's so amazing. I get my food and go home . They have put plenty of napkins and two forks. Awesome. We settle down and begin to eat. Omg the spicy eggplant is a 10! It's amazing I prefer it a spicy level of 8 and it was perfect. Just enough heat for me. I tend to love spicy food the hotter the better I was scared of 10 but I think I could try it next time. The wontons were mixed with pork and shrimp and they were decent nothing to complain about. The eggplant  stole my heart. My boyfriend also loved it all. So Archis has faithful customers with us!"

            "review": "It is finally time to write a review for a restaurant that's grown up with me. As many others, I too remember a time when Archi's was an obscure & tiny Thai restaurant on Flamingo. If I had written a review even up until 2 years ago, I would've given them five stars. But now, things have changed. We've both grown up and moved on to \"bigger and better\" things. However, with an increase in size and popularity (and price), has come a decrease in quality, quantity of food, and service. It is a sad and tragic tale that hopefully might turn around soon? \n\nI miss that restaurant. Now, the food is simply just okay. The portions have gotten significantly smaller and the prices have gone up. The flavor explosions that I would experience earlier have turned into a decently pleasant experience. I love that you control your own level of spiciness. As a Korean family, we always opt 6 or higher\n\nNow, to the food! \n\n1. Papaya Salad: Always consistent and fresh! My family and I always ask for $3 extra. It's a great dish to clean off your palette to start off a meal.\n2. Pad Kee Mao: Any flat Thai noodle dish is a fave of mine, but I just love this dish. It has a great blend of textures with the chewy from the noodles and the crunch from the lettuce and also has a little kick to it. \n3. Spicy Basil Beef: This dish is okay. It's essentially minced meat seasoned with basil and other vegetables. It's a good lunch dish and is to be eaten with rice. It can be a bit salty at times. \n4. Red Curry: This dish has its good times and bad times. I love the depth of the coconut milk but I have received the dish a bit watery with less variety of vegetables. \n5. Catfish Delight: If you're looking for something a little different, I think this is a GREAT dish. Crispy catfish in that blend of I don't even know what! It's amazing! It's a literal foodgasm! The catfish is always fried to the perfect crispiness. TIP: Try to eat it right away or the catfish will get soggy...\n6. Eggplant & Tofu: As a former Vegetarian, I like this dish with fried tofu. The blend of favors is great. HOWEVER, there are times when the eggplant is cooked inconsistently and many times when the eggplant is undercooked. \n7. Pad Thai: I had to review this dish right? It's a mainstream staple! Archi's Pad Thai is stil the best I ever had. I will profess. It's not too sweet, it's not to sour, it's not too salty. It's always just right. \n\nIf you work a day job. Archi's also a great place to pick up lunch to-go! There's a drive-thru that makes it convenient. Overall, yes, this place has a spot in my heart, but it has started to deteriorate ever since I have left abroad for school."

It is located in a fairly old strip mall on W. Flamingo and timing was perfect today for me to drop in for a quick lunch and check out what Yelpers have said was a reasonably priced lunch special from a Thai restaurant. \n\nWhen I arrived around 11:30am, there were already several tables occupied with diners having their lunch.  But I was quickly greeted by one of the petite waitresses and seated at a large table that can comfortably seat 4 or 6.  I felt a little guilty since I was dining alone.  But it didn't end up being an issue since the restaurant didn't get packed as I thought it was based on how hectic the place gets during the mad rush of the lunch crowd.\n\nAnyway, I noticed that their selections of lunch specials is rather small compared to their entire menu offerings.  But I went with their Red Curry with Chicken and also ordered a Thai Iced Coffee.  The waitress soon returned with a really generous size glass of Thai Iced Coffee, it is definitely the largest glass of Iced Coffee I have ever been served. Happy Surprise = +1 on my Yelp meter.\n\nThe Red Curry with Chicken was alright.  The flavor of the curry and the 5 spiciness on the Thai spicy scale was good. But the chicken was really tough, and I didn't care for it at all. The egg roll served is 99% out of the box, and you can really taste the prominent white pepper in the filling or the wrapper.\n\nAmbiance is good, the dining area is rather small, but it didn't bother me. And during lunch there was good amount of ambient lighting from outside, which I believe is a good thing.\n\nAnyway, I am going to have to come back and try some more of the cooking of the Thai mothers and grandmothers working in the back. Because I was seated at the table facing the small window where the kitchen passes the prepared plates to be served, and all I see are a bunch of women on the other side working in the kitchen."

And he said trust me! So we asked for a 4 for the tom yum soup. The soup came out and a 4 was spicy! \n\nWe went back the next day because the food was so good and that time we ordered tom yum with a level 3.

It wasn't too sweet and was just how I like my pad thai. The shrimp was nothing spectacular though.\n- Eggplant and Beef: SOO GOOD! I admit I'm not a big fan of eggplant, but this dish was very good. The beef was cooked perfectly. Not chewy at all. \n- Masaman Curry with Chicken: This was my least favorite dish out of the 4 we ordered. It was a little too rich for my taste. Don't get me wrong. I am a big fan of all types of curries and I usually like the creamy Thai curries, however this one was just a little too much for my taste. The potatoes were a little undercooked and the chicken a little overcooked and rubbery. \n\nService\nGREAT! Amazing!

Nothing harsh but a little something something. I'd go back but only if I'm in that area. I'll go to Panna Thai right near my house or drive to pan Asian. But this place was definitely aok!!!!"

Tom Yum still almost the same but the basil fried rice was very lacking which before the flavors just came out so well and the pad Thai was a disappointment. It used to taste like they actually cared about upholding a standard but now it tastes like status quo. Anyway I guess I have to try other Thai restaurants which I have and I've only liked Lotus. Anyone have suggestions?"

Three stars for promot service, pick up was less than 30mins. \n\nI would give one more star except the flavor was not flavorful. It was somewhat bland, just okay and edible. Also \"medium spicy (5 in a scale of 1-10)\" is pretty much the same as \"not spicy\". I had two dishes to compare, no difference, no kick. I ordered for myself spicy Pineapple beef curry and no spicy sweet and sour chicken, spicy pad Thai. \n\nAnd biggest complaint of all, I found two long strands of dark hair in my husband's pad Thai. I didn't just find it.... the longest strand of hair was in my mouth mixed with the noodles!!!!!! Ugh. \n\nIt's not the worst thing in the world but please tuck your hair back when cooking/carrying/packing the food. It's kind of gross especially I don't know if this person washed their hair or had lice they didn't tell anyone about. Definitely not from my short blonde hair or husbands bald head.\n\nOverall, I'll stick to our koonyai's homemade dishes but if you want a restaurant style meal, there are better places than this one - not impressed."

It was just after the super bowl so I guess this a good thing.  Anyways, the service was friendly and fast.  We had they Pineapple curry and Phad Thai.  The Phad Thai is among the best we have ever had.  The noodles were firm but not rubbery and the sauce was not too sweet or sour.   The curry was good too....a little on the soupier side but was smooth and spicy.  Maybe it's because it was made from powder rather than paste.  Their brown rice was just okay.  A little too fluffy for my liking.  All for under $20, what a great deal.  I even made it to the show with time to spare."

Why yes I do! \nSpeaking of spice, they spice cart had a nice assortment of pickled Thai peppers, not the jalapenos you see at the other places. Nice touch, Also had an interesting sauce that I think she said was fish sauce and garlic with pepper flakes.

I guess it can be kind of an odd request, so other restaurants that we've been to under cook the egg. However, at Archi's they always listen to exactly what we want. One time the egg came out and my boyfriend took a bite of the egg. It wasn't completely well done, but it was definitely nothing to send back or worry about. But our server noticed it immediately and asked if we wanted a new egg. We politely declined because we didn't want to hassle the cooks, but the server brought one out anyway. I loved how attentive he was to our order. The staff is very friendly and they don't mind joking around with us. \n\nThe service and food is what puts Archi's on another level.

Had lots of Thai friends in LA and lived a stone throw from LA's Thai Town. \n\nFirst time-  I grab the \"basics\" usually on the first go at a place to see how things measure up. Sure they may have a standout exotic dish, but if they can't cook the staples of their culture- it's not gonna cut it. So ordered a chicken panang and some ground pork with basil and some spring rolls. The panang was pretty good- just different from what I normally have as it had a heavier hand in coconut cream than most places I've experienced it. Different, but good. Pork basil is good, but really...can you fuck up ground pork, zucchini, basil and chilies? Its just a simple comfort food I like. \n\nNext time we grabbed another of the panang and this time did a pad thai. I'm not sure about the pad thai...it was good enough, but was missing something flavorwise I couldnt pinpoint...maybe needed more tamarind? I hear good things about the Pad Thai so I don't know if this is an off day or  what my palette is looking for is different, but I'll give it another shot the next time around. \n\nService is friendly, but not the most attentive at times with our lady going to the back for long periods of time.  Portions and price is very fair, we had a bit of left overs for my lunch the next day. \n\nI at least see that they are trying to keep things authentic and made with love here so I can appreciate that. Good if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't drive this far specifically for this spot as its rather far from where I live."

Not too sweet, not too spicy (Unless you alter the spice rating), it is perfectly balanced. The meat dishes are perfectly seasoned as well. I haven't had a chance to try the curry, but I've seen a lot of other diners eating it and I've heard a lot of great things about it. For appetizers, the stuffed chicken wings are my favorite. I don't know how they do it, but it's two, over sized drumsticks stuffed with noodles and vegetables, fried golden brown and served with a tasty plum dipping sauce. You have to try it. Also, in my opinion, Thai cuisine has the best fried rice amongst all Asian countries. Try Archi's pineapple fried rice and tell me you don't agree.\n\nThe location on W. Flamingo is the original spot, its extremely small and accommodates about 25-30 people max. But the decor is very \"homey\" and full of great people. The service is friendly, attentive and helpful. The new location off of S. Rainbow and the 215 is a whole lot bigger, but food and service is as consistent as the original location. If you love Thai food, you have to try this place out."

My pepper steak was good, although the \"4\" wasn't as spicy as I was anticipating, so I will bump it up next time. The lunch combo comes with soup, an egg roll and a won ton. Good portion, good price and good food. One in our group ordered Sweet and Sour something and didn't get her meal until the other seven of us were almost done. The other meals just kind of filtered out to the table as they were done. It's kind of hard to eat with friends when everyone is getting their meal at different times.

But it's nothing terribly special, to me. The pad thai is good, but not in any way that sets it apart from the other pad thais in vegas. The curries are again, good, but their flavor seems to rely more on heat than the build of flavors in curries that truly knock my socks off. That seems to be what Archi's does well; everything is at least \"decent\". Nothing is bad. But nothing is amazing, either. I have never craved Archi's; I crave the Panang Curry at Pan Asian, or the Pad thai from Prin Kaow, nor whatever it is my husband always orders from Weera. Archi's is a safe bet, a good lunch place, decent takeout with a group.\n\nBut it doesn't have any favorites. It has no \"Woah. I must tell someone.\" Factor. So, in conclusion:\n\nPros:\n- Nothing noticeably bad in many visits.\n- Polite staff, reasonable wait times, several locations.\n- Starbucks of thai; you will get exactly what you expect, every time. \n\nCons:\n- Nothing noticeably great in many visits.\n- A lot of \"Americanized\" thai dishes, not as much variety as one could hope for.\n- Starbucks of thai; you will get exactly what you expect, every time."

Never had the cravings too much for Thai food before. Archi's is truly the best Thai place I've ever been to. I definitely have lots of favorites here: Pad See Ew, Panang Curry, Pineapple Fried Rice, Pad Thai of course, Spicy Eggplant, Pad Prik King...but even after having them over and over again, I can't get tired of them. The \"new\" dishes that I try periodically don't disappoint me either. Heard the original owner, Mr. Archi was a taxi driver here in town long ago, right? Thank God, he gave up that job~!"

The paint looked old, and there were some patches on the wall. Overall, the restaurant looked clean and it was a little busy when we were seated.\n\nTheir food didn't really blow me out of the water. I have had better Thai food in Vegas -- the food here is just average. I had the yellow curry, which comes with jasmine rice and your choice of meat (I chose beef). They asked me for the spiciness on a scale of 1-10 and their 4 was just right; not too hot, but just enough spiciness to be flavorful. It was a filling meal, but there are probably better places out there with the same price range as Archi's. When it came to dessert, they had mochi ice cream on the menu. Unfortunately, the waiter told us that they didn't even serve it anymore (menu update?). \n\nI'd probably come back because it's in close proximity to where I live, but I wouldn't say it's as amazing as all the hype it seems to have."

I love the Country Curry at Archi's Thai Kitchen, as well as the vegetable fried rice. I like what my friends order as well.   I am vegetarian and there are plenty of vegetarian choices.  The waitresses are good and always ask me if egg is okay (in the fried rice), since they are familiar with a vegetarian's needs.  They refill the drinks often.  Although I definitely know true Thai food (I ate homemade Thai food nearly daily for seven years that was prepared by many different immigrant Thai women) I like Archi's because I can order the amount of spice I need, versus eating the usually very spicy food at the center I attended nearly daily.   It might be a little \"Americanized\" with some dishes, but as long as my guests love it, and I love it,  I don't care.  I usually see a few Thai families at Archi's, though predominantly a mixture of other races.  It is a pleasant demographic. What I really love most about Archi's is the consistently very, very fresh vegetables and food.  I also like that the Clark County Health Department gives \"A\" grades to Archi's (I stay up on that).  I took visitors to Archi's a few months ago but it was too busy at lunch, so I took them down the street to a more expensive well-known Thai restaurant that has had good Las Vegas Review Journal reviews in many years past) and it was definitely not fresh food like I get at Archi's, and that is an understatement.  If Archi's is a little more Americanized in that way it is  okay with me.  I have ordered Archi's take-out for parties at home and it is always a big hit."

            "review": "After remembering coming to Archi's and having a delicious meal, I convinced some of my friends to trek across town for some Thai dinner. However, after eating here, I wonder if I was struck with early memory loss because our meal was varying in degrees of deliciousness.\n\nHitting nearly dinner time, the place wasn't too busy, so we were seated immediately. The waitstaff were very attentive in refilling our drinks and answering miscellaneous questions. One of my friends ordered the Yellow Curry (heat level at 3/4) while the other ordered Pad Prik King (heat level at 0 - she's a big wuss when it comes to heat). I decided to get my favorite, Pad Thai (heat level around 5).\n\nAll of our dishes came out on a timely basis, but some were let downs. My friend's curry lacked much of its heat and also much of its flavor. Literally, the Pad Prik King had more spice than his curry - sad considering what they requested heat wise. He ate a majority of it, but set foot to devouring our dishes instead. The Pad Prik King and Pad Thai were good, but nothing extraordinarily spectacular. Our mounting hunger after watching two movies resulted in both the noodle dishes' demise, but all three of us agreed that we've had better elsewhere.\n\nUltimately, Archi's is not what I remembered it to be years ago. Prior to my first visit two years ago, I kept hearing so many accolades for this place, but after this recent visit, I'm not sure if it's well-deserved."

If you are looking for some real authentic Thai food, don't go to the fancy Thai restaurants on the strip and pay more when you can get the real thing for a fair price on Flamingo(and newer location on Sahara). \n\nI usually order the Tom yum soup, papaya salad, and pad seew with chicken at every Thai place I try. All very yummy at Archie's.\n\nThere are spice levels from 1-10. 1 being mild and 10 being the most spicy. I ordered all 6 on the spicy dishes. I love spicy food, meaning I love jalapenos, habanero, Thai chili peppers. 6 was a little too spicy for me, but after a few bites, I got used to it. I think 5 would be perfect. At least you can add more of your own peppers to taste. I can't even imagine how spicy a 10 would be. I can imagine level 10 being on \"man vs food\".\n\nThe Thai iced tea was good, served in a huge glass. They do put tons of ice, so if you would like more liquid then ice, I'd tell them to lay off the ice a little. I personally like it with a lot of ice though. The thai iced tea also neutralizes the spicy hotness in your mouth.  \n\nThe only negative comment I have about archi's is the bathroom. It's not very clean and there were no paper towels or extra toilet paper.\n\nGo here for real delicious Thai."

It's been years since I've eaten here! One thing that I love about this place is that you get a gigantic glass of thai tea with just the right amount of ice and mixture of tea and cream.  Most other places will give you a regular sized glass and fill it up with ice and it's finished before your food even comes.  This gigantic glass lasts throughout the whole meal and then some!\n\nWe ordered chicken larb (medium spicy) with a side of sticky rice, papaya salad, chicken pad thai, and chicken pad see ew. The entrees came with steamed rice and we didn't have to order it separately. The food altogether was yum. They had asked how spicy we wanted the larb, but they didn't ask for the papaya salad.  I feel like they made the papaya salad medium and the larb mild when I had wanted the larb to be medium.  The larb was ok, although I've had better larb at other Thai restaurants.  \n\nI love the homey feel of this restaurant.  The way that it is set up makes you feel like you are sitting at home enjoying a home cooked meal.  The overall service was excellent and they even packed up our food at the end. The pricing was reasonable as well.  For our meal, including 3 thai teas and 1 thai iced coffee, the total came out to $75."

Since Archi's was closer to me I decided to go with that. \n \nThe restaurant itself looked like a house that was remodeled into a restaurant. Cute and cozy. Looks like a nice place to have a lunch with some friends. I ordered the Pad Kee Mow and the Yellow Curry. I'm just going to assume that curries are already pre-made for the entire day and when ordered, they just heat it up for it to be ready to serve. And Pad Kee Mow's doesn't seem too difficult to whip up either. So why the long wait? I try to play in all possible reasons for the wait before I critique. Lots of people? Nope. Short staffed compared to the number of customers? Nope. I'm patient for the most part, especially if the food makes up for all of it! But sadly, it didn't. \n\nThe Yellow Curry was a little watered down to what I'm used to. The flavor was just not strong enough for me. I wouldn't say it was totally bland but, the curry itself was just not hitting those taste buds like I wanted it to. The Pad Kee Mow was..okay. I wished there was a stronger basil flavor and more noodles. You could tell all the vegetables that came with the dish were canned. Just didn't give off the high quality thai cuisine I had hoped for. \n\nBetter luck next time? I hope so!"

I ordered a Thai tea and it was surprisingly big for $3. The shaved ice in it was different than what I am used to, but I liked it. I ordered the spicy eggplant. The server asked how spicy we wanted our dishes on a scale of 1 to 10; she warned us that 4 is approaching \"the danger zone\". I have been to Thai places that overestimate their spiciness, so I went with a 6. It was pretty damn spicy, but delicious.

Once I saw the signs, I was like .... this will be a good dinner. \n\nWe ordered the fresh spring roll for appetizer, crab fried rice, mixed veggies with beef, and spicy basil with pork in \"medium\" spiciness. The appetizer was an interesting combination of chinese sausage, cucumber, and fish cake(?) - the taste with the sauce was interesting to say the least. It is worth a try if you don't want that fried stuff once in a while. The crab fried rice was one of the best I had, the price is very reasonable for the amount of fried rice we all had. The veggie beef was tasty and the beef wasn't too chewy IMO, and the spicy  basil pork, though was spicy, the taste was there and it was PERFECT with white rice. Yes we got white rice on top of the generous portion. Too bad that our hotel has no fridge nor microwave ....... we could not bring it back.\n\nIF I wanna eat Thai in Vegas, we will be here again"

I have actually been eatting here for the last 4 years and use to go to the original location on torrey pines and flamingo, and since they have opened the one on rainbow and 215 i have been going there instead.\n\nI ordered lard na, and it was served to me chunky with a weird odor.  I tasted it and it was disgusting, I called the server to switch my order and explained to him and her that the noodles were either burnt or old one or the other.  I have ordered the dish in the past and it has never tasted or looked like the way they served it to me that day.  \n\nThe waitress said if she takes the food back it would be a lost to the business and she would have to pay for it!  I was shocked, apalled and offended with her response.  I am not one of those customers that eats all their food and then sends it back for a free or different meal.  The plate was practically untouched and still she refused to take it back, saying it was business policy.  \n\nI asked for a manager, which she said wasn't there.  I am very fimilar with the establishment and knew that Archi himself would be at the other location working, so I had her give me the number to speak to him myself.  \n\nI explained to Archi the situation, and he too said that they never ever take food back, and that his cooks prepare meals the same way every time.  I am of south east asian descent myself, and I know exactly what the dish is suppose to look like, and last but not least I have eatten there before with out the burnt and odor smell.  \n\nIt wasn't until I told him that I would put a bad review, and that I worked in the F & B industry was when he said that they make exceptions once a year.\n\nThats bull if you ask me.  If you are in the area try kin paow on rainbow and windmill, price is comparable and food is much better than archis.  If you disagree, the day any of  you ever dispute the food trust me you will be upset with their \"business policy!\""

We went for #4 in spiciness.\n\nThe food came out promptly. The papaya salad was quite fresh, peppered with dried shrimp and green beans. The taste was akin to that of the Bangkok street stalls. The fish cakes were also quite good and contained bits of either onion or leek. You could tell the slightly gritty ground rice in the larb was homemade instead of rice powder out of a jar.

Pretty much the type of flavor expected in a Thai style salad.  What I was disappointed in was their Phad Thai!  Now EVERYONE has said their Phad Thai was the best, well I must say, i have had better!  The rice noodles were cooked well, but the type of ingredients used wasn't as tasteful, kind of reminded me of Chinese Sa Tay sauce on rice noodles, which was not what I was expecting.  \n\nI asked my friend who's family is from Thailand about her experience there and she basically said, \"It's good, if you like Americanized Thai Food.\"  I responded, well sometimes I do crave it but I prefer the traditional Authentic That food I can get closer to home.  \n\nI mean come on, what kind of Authentic Thai food serves an egg roll and crispy won ton skin with their Phad Thai?

Archi's Thai Kitchen is my favorite because it feels more like a home kitchen.\n\nLocated near Torrey Pines and Flamingo intersection, it stands alone as the only worthwhile eatery in the shopping center it is located in. But due to its slightly nondescript location, it doesn't have the same traffic as the Bistro and Cafe. I've never had to wait for a table and service has always been good.\n\nThe drive through is a little hit or miss. Having a \"go-to take out\" location very close to where you live is such a rockin' thing, but the drive through doesn't always work like you'd want it to. Most of the time you pull up and have to wait until somebody on the waitstaff notices you at the window, which during busy times may be 5 or so minutes. But that's pretty much it in the way of criticism...\n\nThe food quality is consistent and good. The spice level, 1-10, has good range.One thing to note is that the spice intensity seems to vary with the cook. Also, test any takeout before you dive in, especially if you're getting multiple orders of the same thing with different spice levels. \n\nI've eaten at almost every thai place in town and this is my first suggestion for anyone who asks."

At first I thought maybe she didn't see me, but several people walked up and talked to her, and made eye contact with me and a comment to her. Generally I expect to be acknowledged when I'm waiting, even if it's just to say sorry it'll be a couple of minutes- I prefer that over being ignored by far.\n\nGot home with my dishes, good portions for lunch pricing- $8/per person.\nPad thai was a large portion of noodles, chicken was a little on the dry side, dish was a little spicier than expected for a 3 but reasonable. Curry was a 4, which was quite spicy and BF did not care for the spice level but the veggies were fresh and the beef was a good portion. Appreciated that the rice was fresh and fluffy, offset the spiciness of the curry. Both dishes served with a wonton and spring roll- tasty and not overly crispy.\n\nWould swing by to take advantage of lunch pricing again, but after all the hype I simply felt the product wasn't amazing but rather just average."

Friendly server sits us immediately and gives us iced water. I order beer & Chardonnay as is my tradition. WHAT? NO BEER OR WINE? I sob..... It's clearly marked on the Yelp review but I didn't notice. Dumb. Anyway the food; we order Sesame Toast and egg rolls to start. The toast is deep fried and too greasy, egg rolls were fine. 10 year old McDonalds aficionado wants plain chicken , they fry him up plain chicken and it was great. Teen wants chicken fried rice and a Mongolian beef dish, ordered 3/10 on the heat/spice scale she thoroughly enjoyed it. Wifee ordered the same, but being a spicy food bigshot, she went for 7/10. Good choice, wifee happy. I take a chicken cashew dish , 5/10 (pathetic , I know ) and was equally happy. There were many Thai clientele eating and the place was charming.\nGreat food, $70 before tip and we will be back to Archi's but I believe the other locations will give me a beer to quench my thirst and alleviate the heat should I go crazy and order my food 6/10 on the spice meter."

Only complaint was the service was kinda bad. We each were given a fork with napkin. When I asked for knives, she only then brought out 1 knife for us to cut our stuffed chicken wings. My husband and I had to share a knife. Made it a little difficult to eat without a spoon to scoop and sharing a knife. I gave up trying to get their attention for silverware or drink refill. As every time a server or busser walked by they walked so fast and no eye contact. Food was excellent, but I'll stick to my usual fav Thai restaurants."

Their lunch special is from 11am-3pm (3pm, i think?) and it comes with salad, soup, and an eggroll + your chosen dish for about $7.00.\n\nWhatever you order, from the curry to pad thai to papaya salad, the server  will ask you \"How spicy?\" The scale is from #1-10. I like medium spicy, so i usually ask for spicy level # 6. If I feel like I want medium spicy that leans towards hot, I'll ask for level #7. \n\nSince this place has 3 chains all located in different parts of the town, it makes it very convenient to get your Thai food fix wherever you are. The ambiance of this place is very soft, clean, and inviting. I love dinning here. I always feel like I am at a resort. You know what i mean when you check this place out.\n\nSide note--\nIf you have a big party, I suggest you go to Archi's Thai Cafe (located on W Sahara Ave). Its a bit more open and spacious. Archi's Thai Kitchen is a bit small and on the cozier side."

I do it because a)it's close, b) it's not divey like Lotus of Siam (which is close to the infamous Green Door... dive!), c) their prices are reasonable during lunch time.\n\nThe pad thai is a little too spartan on the protein, a little on the sweet side, and a little on the wetter side than I like. Sometimes it does lack \"wok-hey\" depending who's cooking (what we Asians call \"wok air\" - meaning the heat of the wok required for that slight char on stirfried dishes), it's flavourful enough to warrant subsequent visits.\n\nThe pad see-ew tastes good but occasionally suffers from use of poor parts of chinese broccoli (gailan). The resturant does not strip the outer fibrous, bitter stem to the more tender middle parts which would definitely improve the dish.\n\nThe spicy eggplant with thai basil again has nice flavours but the overall greasiness of the dish is off-putting (but then again eggplant is really hard to stirfry, period). The green papaya salad is fresh and goes well with the oppressive Vegas heat.\n\nThe real value is at lunch time. You can get various offerings for only $6.95 which is good for a thai restaurant. Also at this location, they have unlimited refills of certain sodas which they don't have at the Summerlin/W. Sahara branch.\n\nAs for service, expect to be served with efficiency so that the tables can be filled by other patrons. Don't expect that your beverage glass will be looked after quickly either. Lunch time is hectic at this location so get here a little earlier than noon or after 1pm to avoid waiting."

From the rich flavors of the rice along with the sourness of the soup, nothing hits close to home than this dish. \n\nWhile tom kha is very flavorful, only a few restaurants actually use the type of mushroom I enjoy. Button mushrooms never go along with tom kha as it doesn't absorb the flavors very well. But Archi's has got this food down to the science as it highlights salty and sour perfectly. I prefer no spice to this soup as I don't handle it well. Still, other people who enjoy spice wouldn't get a kick from it. \n\nThe other day, I visited this restaurant for a team meeting with a client. I ordered spicy level 5 while others in my party opted for something of the like. To our surprise, spice was lacking from such a dish. Nonetheless, it was delicious but I think there should be a system incorporated to adding the spice. I'm not disappointed on this behalf but I think other guests would appreciate the effort. \n\nAmongst my favorite dishes here is the pineapple fried rice which included a good amount of vegetables, your choice of meat and spices! Along with tom kha, it's the best combination to eat for winter. It's definitely my go-to! \n\nPad Thai here is a hit and miss. I was cheering for it to be delicious but sometimes the noodles are dry. The other times I've ordered them was flavorful but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary! After countless of visits, I'm not particularly fond of this dish. Definitely a skip for me! \n\nPad see ew is delicious but it's the same situation as pad Thai. Sometimes it's dry and other times it's perfectly made. Different chefs, maybe? \n\nThe service is also a hit and miss. Most of the time, you're really waited on but other times you're neglected. For a restaurant that is pretty well established, I'm not sure service or food should be inconsistent. How they get away with such a thing is beyond my words. \n\nStill, I respect this restaurant as its deserving of a solid 3 stars for me. I've had my fair share of disappointing Thai restaurants in Las Vegas but Archi's, never comes close to dissatisfaction."

Service is good and I never have a problem ordering food on the phone  I always get their beef green curry, shrimp Tom yum or their shrimp fried rice. Next time I come in I'm going to try something different  till next time...."

We ordered everything at a hot level of \"5\" and could have probably ordered a \"3\" or \"4.\"  We asked if anyone ordered it hotter, and our waitress told us that some order it at a \"25\" or \"30.\"  I'm not sure I believe that, because it has to be impossible to survive even a \"10\" at this place.  Anyway, the service was great, the place was clean, the food was awesome, and I'll go back if I find myself in Las Vegas again."
