            "review": "This was the first time eating here and I have to say, I didn't care for the d\u00e9cor.  It was very sterile and cold feeling, that being said though, I primarily base my rating on food only.  We decided to eat here because they had sent  us a $50 coupon, which almost covered my meal.\n\nThe menu is pricey and I am not sure if the food justifies the price, that being said, my husband had the lamb chops and said that they were the best he had ever had and I tend to agree, they just melted in your mouth and the pine nut parmesan crust really enhanced the flavor of the lamb.  He also had the Caesar salad and said that it was good as well.  He is a Caesar snob, so it must have been good. \n\nI had the Hearts of palm salad, which was tasty, but a little too over dressed.  I had the grilled salmon and sweet potato hash, which was nothing special.  The hash was basically chunky mashed sweets with by the fact that they were so creamy, tells me how much cream or butter was mixed in.  We usually will opt for a veggie side, if the menu is ala carte (which it is), but the sides were very uninspired and most of the offerings were smothered in cheese, cream, or fried.  \n\nOver all, not a bad dinner, but nothing that wowed us enough to want to return, especially since there are so many other places in Vegas that we haven't tried yet."

            "review": "People that know me know I fully believe teeth are to be used to rip into a good steak from time to time.  And if youre looking for a good steak, N9NE does not disappoint.  I've been to steakhouses in Dallas, LA, Vegas, Dubai, NYC, etc and this one makes my top 5 hands down.  The meat is flavorful and they seem to have cooks that actually know what they are doing - which in some places is rare (pardon the pun).  I took my fianc\u00e9e, cousin and his girlfriend there for his graduation.  We had the 40oz Rib Eye for two which they nailed.  Cooked to perfection.  And the attention to detail was there too...apps came out on time and dinner didn't overlap apps.  Drinks never went empty and the service was NOT in your face...it just happened.  The bill for four was $400 but what do you expect for a steak place in Vegas?  If you need to satisfy the craving to be the top of the food chain in Vegas no question this is the place"

            "review": "I was initially worried about going to N9NE, because I thought it was going to be a long wait till we were seated, it was going to be outrageously expensive and extremely boujie. \n\nI shouldnt have been so presumptious because my experience here was BOMB DIGGITY.\n\nThis food is orgasmic shit.  I dont order steak very often, but when I do I am expecting it to be damn good.  The filet I had here is up there with the best steak I've ever had, which was at Roxy's at the El Dorado in Reno of all places.  I hate that nasty overcooked, charbroiled taste, but thankfully there was none to be found on this delectable piece of meat.  In addition, I have to say that the creamed corn I ordered here was probably the best side I've ever had.  Better than Izzy's creamed spinach (sorry Samantha).  George Maloof really hit the nail on the head with this one.\n\nAlso, our waiter was refreshingly friendly and not snooty at all.  I don't know what Kristin S. is talking about with the asshole waiters.  I was prepared and waiting for it, but I never got any dissaproving looks or pretentious attitude.  \n\nI've decided to have my birthday dinner here because I like the modern ambiance, the fun music, the amazing food and the non-hoop jumping experience I hope to have again.  Can't wait until Oct 15th!"

            "review": "I ate at N9NE twice during my weekend Vegas trip. The first time we went, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, so we ordered too much and didn't get to order dessert - which had been the sole reason I wanted to go in the first place. I had heard about their campfire s'mores dessert, but I had to come back a second time to actually get it. \n\nMy boyfriend had the filet mignon and when questioned about whether he enjoyed it, he said, and I quote, \"Uh, yeah, uh. It was solid.\" Basically, he liked it, and didn't have much to complain about. I chose to go with the Short Rib Ravioli as my entr\u00e9e, since we were getting appetizers and sides. The ravioli was good. You don't get much, but it was enough for me with all the other food we were getting. \n\nWe got the Buffalo Chicken Wontons to start, which were okay. Not something to write home about. For our sides, we got the Lobster Mac and Cheese and truffle fries with garlic aioli. I was disappointed in both of them. I just didn't find the mac and cheese to be anything special, and it was overpriced for how little you get. The fries themselves were good, but the aioli was way too smooth and thin. It didn't taste like an aioli. It had no bite or tang to it. Just basically a watery garlic cream sauce. \n\nThe service was excellent on that trip. However, the service on the second trip for my dessert s'mores was a different story. We came in after the dinner rush, and basically after we got the s'mores, we never saw the waitress again. Our glasses were empty most of the time we were there on this dessert trip, and I get it - we had a low tip value. But that doesn't mean that we should get awful service. All we wanted was some more water. \n\nOther than the terrible service, I loved the idea of roasting your own marshmallows to make s'mores. More restaurants should implement it, honestly. It was a fun experience, and my boyfriend loved it. I would come back again just for that. Even with the non-existent service. \n\nThe restaurant is very \"club-like\" with its mood lighting and lounge-type furniture. It was loud with lots of people, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place as romantic date material. You would barely be able to hear each other over the din of people talking and music playing. I would say attire is club friendly to business professional to casual. \n\nOverall: 3/5\nFood: 3/5\nService: 3/5\nAtmosphere: 2/5"

            "review": "I really love this place; it's one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Not only do they have a really great steak, but they also have amazing appetizers (Oysters Rockefeller in particular), but they were amazingly accommodating to my vegan friend as well, who gave them a list of restrictions and they concocted a meal for that wasn't simply a pile of sauteed vegetables. \n\n This is the sort of place that you really hope to find in a Las Vegas dinning experience. It's elegant and fashionable and has really amazing food. In my opinion,  Las Vegas has a lot of restaurants that really rest on their location, but this place earns it's keep. \n\nThe service is exceptional and the food is as well, making this one of my favorite places to east when I was a local and someplace that I really look forward to retuning to whenever I'm back in town."

            "review": "The food and decor is very good. We had to wait a little while even though we had a reservation and the cocktail lady at the bar wasn't very helpful. Once a few in our party ordered some waters she was not interested in serving us anymore. The service has a bit of an attitude overall we noticed. Our server was good at what he did but was kind of a douchebag. He talked up the place very big and I don't think he realized that he was serving some pretty judgmental guests who have dined at some of the finest restaurants in the country.\n\nOverall the food was pretty good. I had a dry aged rib-eye which was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Way too much food for one person. The side dishes were just okay. Nothing to write home about. The gnocchi was soaking in butter and the thin fries were so thin and short they were actually hard to eat. For four of us the bill was a little over $300 which I thought was a bargain. We didn't order any alcohol though which would have easily made our bill closer to $500.\n\nWith all the great steakhouse options in Vegas I'd most likely find myself passing on this place in the future. It was good but the overall experience wasn't up to snuff."

            "review": "I gotta say, I wasn't overly impressed with N9NE. Went for our anniversary dinner on a Thursday night. It was pretty slow when we arrived and it was just the two of us. Now with so many open seats I was expecting we would get a nice area to sit. Nope! We were put all the way in the back next to a guy eating by himself. Yup, that's how I envisioned my anniversary dinner. Sitting next to the one guy in the restaurant eating by himself where its quiet and he can here everything we talk about. We had a good idea of what we wanted before we got there based on Yelp pictures and reviews as well as checking out the menu on their site. I should have known not to trust the menu pricing I saw from a pic somebody had taken as the dish we were interested in was about $40 more than what I was expecting. Not their fault, mine for assuming.\nWe scratched that idea and decided to split a steak and some sides and leave room for dessert. Ordered a 22 oz steak with mac and cheese and gnocchi as sides. I'm not the biggest steak fan so I judged that based on Kacey and she liked it. I thought it was pretty good. The mac and cheese was tasty but tiny! The gnocchi was very good and a little pricey for the size. \nFor dessert we went with the s'mores. This was the highlight for me as it is a cool display and fun to make. They were some of the best s'mores I've had.\nI had never been before but heard some good things. I was a bit disappointed in the atmosphere and it felt a bit cheesy and outdated to me. Maybe when this place is busy it's better. The server was decent, a bit chatty and somewhat unprofessional for a nice steakhouse but friendly and made some good recommendations. \nDoubt I will ever head back unless somebody else is buying haha"

My steak was only $50 and was so big it could have fed an entire family of hipsters. Steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, which until then was something restaurants west of the Mississippi were incapable of doing in my experience. \n\nThe atmosphere is a little trendy for my taste, but if you go in a big enough group you don't really notice. \n\nMy favorite Vegas steakhouse."

The seafood bucket appetizers are so killer. The lobster tail is too good, one of the only lobsters I don't have to drown in butter. Even the pretzel bread you eat while your food is coming, is almost a meal in itself. Be back for sure, of course when I'm invited... Cause I definitely don't have that cash in hand."

They did almost loose a star because we had dinner reservations at 545 and they didn't sit us down until almost 6. One more minute and we were knocking off a star. So our waiter was great. He recommened the bone in filet migon and the creamed corn. This meal was better than any other meal I ever had...I had the lamb chops crusted with pine nut rosemary in au jus....this was the best food ever. The lamb just fell off the bone. If you never had lamb...try it here...you will love it. Now for the two other sides we got ..the mac and cheese and the creamed corn. The mac and chees was better than any other place. You could tell it was made from scratch. We spent 240 for the both of us and I would of paid up to 400 for this food. Our price included a 60 dollar bottle of wine. If you don't like the younger crowd of vegas don't go spend too much time in the Palms because this place is not for the elderly. By the way something weird..all the waiters but one were dudes..and the army of hostess were all girls...they probably had like 10 of them....if you love steak make sure you eat here.\"\n\nShe said, \"Totally agreeing with my boyfriend on this one. This place went above and beyond any resturaunt i had ever eaten at. The atmosphere, service and food was all awesome. I didnt even mind waiting a little bit before we were seated because they have comfy seats and a flat screen you can wait at. Also, its closed off to the casino so you can eat privatley. The waiter suggested the 16oz bone in fielt mignon and lamb. It was amazing, the steak was the best steak i had ever eaten and im glad my first time trying lamb was here. We didnt plan on going here, we were actually planning going to switch, but after reading yelp reviews we decided to ditch switch and go here instead. Such a good decision. We will def be back to eat here.\""

We were absolutely famish when we got there.\n\nAs a starter, we got the rock shrimp. Fittingly, the shrimp came in a popcorn carton. Because it was exactly like popcorn shrimp, in a bad way. Comes with two dipping sauce, one mayo base and the other was Sriracha based. Nice kick with the Sriracha but it was still popcorn shrimp. Nothing special.\n\nFor our main dish, we had the couple's 40oz bone-in ribeye that comes with twice baked potato. Got a side of cream spinach bruelee. Also, one order of the Kobe burger. \n\nIf you didn't know, 40oz is a lot of meat. Even though we came famish, by the end, we were completely stuffed. The server told us, their steaks were wet-aged which by definition is inferior to dry-aged. And you know what, you can taste the difference. The ribeye was good but not spectacular. Even though we order med-rare, it wasn't as juicy and tender as it could be. The flavor was lacking as well. The steak does come with a gravy, so that helps.\n\nTwice baked potato was decent and the cream spinach was nice with the caramelize crust.\n\nMy boy had the Kobe burger. Unfortunately, he likes his beef well done, so the Kobe tasted like crap. Also, his fries were very dry.  A disappointing dish. \n\nCold light Pinot Noir, meh.\n\nService was spotty. When the main server did tend to us, nice and friendly. But I thought he was unattentive at times. He could have checked on us more often. I thought the water boy took better care of us than the main server. When we inquire about getting passes to Ghostbar, the water boy was the one that assure us we can get it despite initial hesitation from the server. Eventually, he did gave us passes to Ghostbar.\n\nIn comparison, I thought Craftsteak is better.\n\nOverall, more hype than substance. The attraction is more trendiness than quality food. Is it worth a stop to see what the fuss is about, sure. But as long as you don't come with high expectations, you'll be fine."

Based on the prices of seen I was expecting to need to wear my fine fabrics in order to fit in.  We get there and:\n\n the wait was fairly short...maybe 10 minutes.  \n\nThe restaurant was loud, I attribute it to the amount of people in there.  I think there may have only been one empty table in the whole place.  \n\nOn to the food...best ceasar salad I have ever had.  I recommend getting the ultimate surf & turf.... The regular surf and turf was delicious...however the portion was smaller than I would have liked.  \n\nThe device was impeccable, and the food literally melted away all of the stress of my week\n\nBest meal I've had in a long time...might be the best meal I've had in Vegas.\n\nBring your big boy wallet $$$"

My suggestion is that you request to MODIFY the agreement, and add in that guest can order off the regular menu at regular prices!!! Don't let them say otherwise, because  ALL agreements can be modified. If they complain, than there is your first sign that they will be unaccommodating to you and your guest, and you should take your business elsewhere. We had (14) people, which they sat us down in the main room with everyone else, as the walk-ins & reservations. Nothing is wrong with that, but when they tell you that you can not order off the regular menu, it's not fair. After fighting them because one guest wanted to order at $28.00 hamburger, they came back and said, that they can do that,  but they would still have to pay $110.00 for the hamburger. The whole thing got blown out of proportion, and they finally settled.  I would understand if they gave us a private room, but when you are sitting next to a couple that just walked in, and they can freely order what they want at regular prices, you should be able to do the same thing. Besides, they give you too much food, which no one was able to finish, some food was untouched, even for extra large people.  \n\nIt's sad that the N9NE Group was not looking at the bigger picture. Many businesses would have been more grateful, and treated our group of (14) a lot better. Our bill quickly added up to $2,500.00, which came out more because of our alcohol purchase.  An now none of us are ever going to return there, nor say good things about them to our friends, nor our social friends on social sites (Yelp, Facebook, etc).\n\n\"Poor Management\" with large groups - which ruins the whole experience."

This is \"the place to be seen\" when you are on the Palms properties, lots of pretty people watching and don't be suprised if you are sitting down next to a celeb, I always see celebs dining in there. Atmosphere is upbeat and loud but brings a great positive energy with it. This is a steakhouse and they do steaks and fillets best, I have switched it up a few times and tried some of their others entrees and seafood but I keep coming back to either their bone in fillet or fillet mignon with blue cheese crust, very basic but they do it better than anyone else. Everything is ala carte and prices are higher, but you get what you pay for. Reservations are highly recomended especially on weekends at peak hours...enjoy"

My ribeye, while cooked inside correctly, was WAY too charred on the outside. That awful charcoal flavor was also on the grilled veggies. The gnocchi was HEINOUS. Bacon was overused and not very high quality. We hated the creamed spinach. Frankly, of all that we ordered, the only thing I ate almost completely was the baked potato, in spite of the fact that it had gobs of crappy/cheap? bacon on it. Chalk it up to extreme hunger. Gotta say, I was totally surprised at this abysmal dining experience.\n\nThinking the lack of enthusiasm/appetite that night could be the excitement of travel, etc., we had them wrap up the vast amount of food left because our room had a fridge. BIG MISTAKE. The next morning the fridge reeked of the Garlic-y gnocchi and spinach and fake-y bacon smell that seemed to be on everything they served.\n\nWould NEVER recommend or return to this restaurant unless it was paid for by someone else and we could order a VERY expensive bottle of wine.\n\nSorry George, I call this a total Fail."

            "review": "So we came here on a Saturday night and it was pretty packed but we had reservations for 9:45pm. This was pretty much the only time they had available so I figured it was bound to be busy.\nWe showed up a little early and were told to wait by the bar but our table wasn't ready until almost 10. By this time, I was starving and irritated by the ridiculously loud music and kept looking at my watch wondering why it was taking so long. \nWhen we were finally seated, our hostess was apologetic and our server was very nice. I just couldn't get over the annoying music and the rather tacky looking purple lighting. I thought this was going to be a classy steakhouse but instead it seemed to be more like a club that just happened to also be a restaurant.\n I mean maybe it was because I was so hungry and both me and my boyfriend had been awake for over 17 hours so we were pretty worn out. I was cranky and just not in the mood for this place and we almost ended up walking out because our table seemed to be taking so long. \nOverall though, I had a pretty great experience at this place once we were finally seated and I was able to eat some food. The pretzel bread they gave us was aaaawesome. Warm and soft, served with a very horseradishy mustard. Pretty good start! We got a couple drinks and ordered the avocado fires and beef tartare. Both were absolutely delicious but the tartare was by far my favorite. It came with a big heap of arugula with shaved parmesan and there was just sooo much yummy raw beef on the plate that it could have been a meal in itself. \nThe avocado fries were very unique but I'm not sure if I would order them again. Pretty simple and tasty, but alas forgettable.  \nThe BEST part that I keep thinking about were these little chicken empanadas that a server brought us. He said they were a little complimentary taster from the kitchen, so definite bonus points there. There were two perfect miniature empanadas topped with a dollop of chipotle cream on the plate and we both devoured them post haste. Delicious, tender masa fried to a perfect golden brown wrapped around nicely spiced, shredded chicken.  And the chipotle cream was nice compliment, not overpowering like some chipotle things can be. If anyone from N9NE is reading this, you HAVE to put those on your menu. They are phenomenal.  \nWe also each ordered a soup, the lobster bisque and French onion. The French onion was by far one of the best I have ever had, and I've had quite a few. It's one of my favorite go-to soups and this one was simply outstanding. Perfect flavor, lots of creamy gruyere cheese and just the right amount of thinly sliced, caramelized onions. Some places cut the onions too big and there are just too many compared to the amount of broth, but this place was spot on. I'd give five stars just for the soup alone. The lobster bisque was equally delicious and they finish the soup at the table, pouring it over the big chunks of fresh lobster already in the bowl. It was very good but so so filling. \nBy this time, we knew our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we practically tapped out. \nThen our entree came, the 40 oz ribeye for two served with lobster mac and cheese. We also ordered a side of the creamed spinach. It looked absolutely amazing and tasted exactly so, but we took about two bites and were done.\n \"Wrap it up!\" I told our servers, and they laughed about it being the record for calling it quits so soon on this gigantic steak. \"It's still warm!\" \nWe simply couldn't do it though, we were too full and too tired to eat more. The servers were so nice about it though and perfectly wrapped up all our leftovers to take back to our hotel room. \nWe happily ate our leftovers and reminisced about how delicious everything was at this restaurant. The only critiques I have would be that the mac and cheese is a wee bit salty and the creamed spinach was actually slightly better the next day, but otherwise the food is absolutely amazing. \nI just wish the music wasn't so darn loud!"

            "review": "My wife and I do not have the same taste in food.  However, the one thing we do agree on is that if we both had to pick our one and only favorite meal ever, it would be the Surf n' Turf from N9NE.  We have eaten there every time we have been to Vegas over the past five years which means we've had the surf n' turf probably 15 or 20 times.  It is consistently excellent 100% of the time; never a complaint.  Also, a bonus tip for you before getting into the review; if you plan to go to any of the Palms' night clubs, ask your server to get you a cover charge comp and VIP entry; they can definitely do the former to save you some money and our server has always been able to do the latter too but not sure if that's him or the restaurant so not sure if you should expect that to happen or not.\n\nOkay, so we had a very good experience with our server the first time we visited N9NE in 2008, his name is Jeremy and he still works there.  I highly recommend asking to be seated with him when you visit.  We haven't been able to see him every time we've gone but more often then not we have; he's been there I want to say ten years now.  In any case, you won't be disappointed; he's very attentive to detail and your needs.\n\nBack to the food; I can give my experiences with a few of the appetizers but regarding entrees, unfortunately I can't offer any opinions on anything else they serve because all I've ever had is the surf n' turf; it was good enough that I lost interest in trying other items the first time I ate there.  \n\nApps first; I've had the ahi tuna tartare, rock shrimp and sashimi n9ne.  All three are excellent; very fresh, very tasty.  The shrimp are quite large; no complaints there.  The ahi tuna does not give you *that* much tuna, so of the three, I'd say that one is the app that trends towards being a bit over priced.  The sashimi is an excellent selection of several different types of fish as well as caviar and shrimp so it's great to share as well.  The presentation is excellent; long rectangular plate with everything arranged neatly to display the types of fish without encroaching on one another.  You will also receive complimentary bread of varying types with regular butter and a horseradish-based spicy mustard that is awesome.\n\nNow, entree time.  Their surf n' turf differs from others' in a few ways; first and foremost, you get a claw and a tail, from Maine, not just bits and pieces of tail meat, not gulf, and not some previously frozen crap.  The lobster sits on top of the filet which sits on top of their lobster mashed potatoes and then it's drizzled and surrounded by a white aioli sauce.  You can of course have parts held off or not combined if you don't like any of those bits.  I personally ask that they put the aioli on the side and give me the 'sauce tray' which is an assortment of four additional sauces; it's not on the menu but your server should be able to make it happen.  I'm going to upload a picture of it so you know what it looks like.  One is I believe a port wine reduction, one is a mustard-based sauce that trends towards spicy, the other two seem to change from time to time so they may be seasonal or regularly changed so I can't remember what you may or may not get.  The filet portion of the meal is also great.  I order mine medium rare and want to see some pink; if it's medium, I'm not happy.  My wife orders what she calls \"rare plus\" which she picked up from the excellent Berns Steakhouse in Tampa, FL and means rare with warm red center, not rare cold by the time it gets to the table.  She's also picky about this.  They've never messed it up.  Can't say enough about this place.\n\nDrinks?  Their mojitos are excellent; fresh mint, not too much simple syrup, and not too weak on the booze which really pisses me off.  Long islands always seem to come out nice and strong.  They do have some kind of crazy $150 margarita on the menu that I've never seen anyone order but would love to have someone buy me one lol.\n\nOkay, so is N9N3 pricey?  Yes.  Is it a plate covered in awesomeness?  Yes.  So win some cash at the craps table first and parlay that into a meal you won't forget."

I took my wife to N9NE at the tail end of May.\n\nI was ill-prepared to be well-dressed as it was vacation, but not only did they seat us with courtesy but had no problems getting us in on last-minute reservations.  Stewart, our table assistant, was excellent in handling explanations and service for my wife and I.  \n\nThe food lived up to billing - from beginning to end, from salads to steaks to desserts.  The meat was prepared to spec, and required no additional seasoning or additives - nor was it over-prepared or over-salted.  \n\nAt the end of the night, the bill was more reasonable than I expected.  All staff was courteous and friendly from the time we entered the facility to our departure.  N9NE is on my planned stopping point in January when I go back for a conference.\n\nAnd I'll ask for Stewart."

Had to flag the waiter for each and everything we wanted. from a menu, to drinks, to ordering, to more water, to bread, to the check, the guy never stopped by the table without being flagged down. Decor is different, like eating in a miami nightclub, kind of cool in a way. food was okay, lobster mashed was really tasty, filet mignon was solid, not the greatest ever, and really, how hard is it to mess up a filet.

I've been here a few times and meant to write a review.  The last time I went I was with a friend of mine who is a school teacher in Vegas and she was really blown away.  This place definitely is not the kind of place you  go with a teachers salary.  I had intially tried to get a reservation and was told none were available.  I then talked to one of the casino hosts who a friend hooked me up with (Jesse... young asian guy).  And, magically we had a prime table at 8 PM.  You should dress to impress and plan on dancing the food off after dinner.  We went with another couple.. none of my friends had been there before and defaulted to steaks.  Becky had a filet (I think.. had a few drinks by dinner time).  It was cooked perfectly and was definitely a prime cut.  I tried it and while it was tender and moist I think in general Filet's lack flavor.  Mike had a bone in ribeye which  was  awesome and probably one of the best tasting steaks I've ever tried.  I don't remember what his wife had.  Since I've tried the steaks before and quite frankly in my opinion steaks at the high end steak places all pretty much taste the same to me whether its mortons, ruths, capital grille etc.. I think they differentiate themselves with atmosphere, service, and the sides.  I had a lobster that they cracked for me.  It was ridicoulous.  I think it was like 3 lbs. and I would suggest if you are going to try this you should ask the price first.  I'm pretty sure this lobster was around $150.  It was good, cooked perfectly and lots of butter.  The sides were pretty good, but nothing remarkable.  We had the mashed potatoes.  I think there was lobster in it (but not much).  For some reason I'm pretty sure they didn't have asparagus, which was disappointing.  Overall a fun experience, great service, good atmosphere, and I definitely suggest hitting the \"Ghost Bar:\" next door."

I'm not sure why at finer dinning restaurants the staff are sometimes not as personable but that seems to be the norm. I would have loved more interaction and excitement when speaking to the menu, specials and restaurant.\n\nWe started with drinks which were great. I had a Prim and Proper and my Husband a smoke flavored cocktail which arrived on fire!  So cool! We opted for the featured stone crab appetizer and calamari as well as the free ravioli that comes when you check in there on yelp. Stone crab was the biggest let down. $35 for a very small claw with no flavor. It tasted like water... The calamari was good with a nice tangy kick and lots of peppers for the heat.\n\nFor the entrees I went for lamb with a side of King crab legs and asparagus. My husband chose the 7 Oz rib eye and truffle fries. The lamb was breaded in a tasteless mixture which I scraped off but the lamb itself was decent but not for $68. Also there was no dipping sauce or mint jelly which I feel really helps to bring out that flavor. The asparagus was great with a lemon bite to it. The Alaskan king crab legs were cooked well and not too chewy with a side of hot butter. The truffle fries smelled fantastic and tasted equally as good, unfortunately they were overwhelming and far to rich to be enjoyable after 3 or 4.\n\nI think n9ne has good food but I don't see us coming again in the future as locals. The bill totaled over $300 for 2 which was ok but recently we have visited another establishment that delivered better for food much less."

Succulent meat seasoned nicely they do give you sauces for dipping your meat but I feel if it is done as a restaurant should do it I should not have to cover the flavors with sauces.\n5.

The busser also kept trying to take my plate away I felt like he was rushing me and it made me a bit perturbed.  One star off for these two things.\n\nThe next star taken off was the crazy party people up in the bar area.  It was 7:30 PM this is a nice restaurant not a lounge the food prices reflect the fact it is a fairly nice restaurant in this town.  (the pre fixed is actually a deal for what you get)  We came in sat at the bar to have a glass of wine and wait for the rest of our party there is a group of people at the near end to us Whoo Hooing and screaming like they were at the newest concert in town doing shots getting louder and louder.  When we moved to our table we continued to hear them.  I am all for a good time but this is not a nightclub nor is it a lounge and there needs to be some separation for the dinners that are paying for a fabulous meal.  The music was also so loud that I could only hear the person next to me not my boyfriend across from me and of you were 2 seats down forget it!  Again are you a lounge/nightclub or a restaurant?  They need to decide what they want to be because you cannot serve this good of food and ruin in with crazy whoo whoos and shot chants.  \n\nI would come back for the food but I would have to be drunk to enjoy the atmosphere and if I'm drunk I will probably opt for somewhere else because I certainly don't care a whole lot about my food at that point! ;)"

It was about 8 of us and after about a 45 minute wait we were seated. I was astonished to see just how pricey the menu was, especially the wine list. But when in Vegas, party like a rockstar. So I went for the Lobster and Filet mignon ($59). The meat was so tender and juicy it just melted in your mouth like hot butter. I also got to try the Porterhouse and it was a thing of beauty. I love steak, I love it and this place right at the top of my list. I also got to try the French Onion soup and I have to say that it was the best soup I ever had. For 8 of us, the bill totaled about $700. Not your everyday steakhouse but if your looking for something out of this world, strap on and they will take you there."

I didn't complain about it because I just didn't want to do that and be embarrassed in front of my friend....in the end, I might give this place one more shot only to get it right.

Can we savor the moment, please, since it would all go downhill after this! \n\nWe placed our order:  Organic Fire Chicken for myself and My boyfriend had the 18oz Prime Bonein Ribeye (35 Day, Dry Aged). \n\nTo share: Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Mac and Cheese and Garbage Salad, we were hungry! \n\nOrganic Fire Chicken, the concept was good, I see where they were going with this, however the chicken was dry I paired this with a Merlot which was much needed to assist in washing down the dry chicken. \n\nPrime Bonein Ribeye steak - My boyfriends first thought I can cook a better steak, but whatever he takes it down no complaining, he hates complaining.  \n\nLobster Mashed Potatoes - Way too fishy for my liking, didn't mesh well. \n\nMac and Cheese - I've had WAY better, in fact my Mac n cheese is better! \n \nGarbage Salad - wouldn't know, never received it! \n\nBasket of Bread - Full of Gnat Flies, two lingered around long enough to take a picture see in pictures #307\n\nWe complained to the waiter on the things we were unhappy with and let him know we never got our salad, he said I'm sorry about that, we told him about the flies he said \"I'm sorry about that, its summer\". No buddy it feels like summer, it isn't summer yet!  Offers us a free entry to the Ghostbar, what a joke! We couldn't even get into the lounge \"they were at capacity\". \nBack in our room - my boyfriend starts feeling sick, next morning I'm vomiting!! Great, We've been food poisoned or picked up a bug from this place! Never would recommend this place to my worst enemy or set foot in this place ever again!!!!  Who is running this disgusting establishment? We should of spoke to a manager, but my boyfriend the guy who hates to complain preferred to pay our $246.00 tab and move on, well I can't move on especially when I am still grossed out on food 4 days later, so here I am on yelp! Just don't eat here, there is way better out there, trust me!"

Food was amazing except for the Barry's Steak. \nSo there was apx 18 of us ladies who had small tables reserved for us (not dinning tables) we were greeted shortly after we arrived & we all got a free glass of champagne that was delicious! Nice & sweet, the way I like it. \nWe had the special menu that had a couple $5.00 drinks on it. Unfort. none of them were drinks I like to drink so I was kinda bummed out that I couldn't get my drinks for $5.00. The menu also included some $9.00 entree's (see photos). I ordered the Lobster Pot Stickers which were really good & packed full with Lobster. There was no skimping here. Came in a cute dish & had a tasty butter dipping sauce that may of had some lemon flavoring in it. I also ordered the Barry's Steak Medium Rare but it came out medium, I suppose it may be hard to cook a 3oz steak to temperature but I had to send it back & the next one that came out was cooked more to temperature but found the meat chewy with a few strands of fat in it. My friend let me try her N9NE Rock Shrimp which was also good  & had two dipping sauces, one was a little hot that left a bite in your mouth afterwards. She got the garbage salad & said it was really good. There were no left overs on our plates! Our waiter was amazing!! Robert was his name, he took good care of us girls (I'm sure he didn't mind either...lol) he had everything under control & made sure we were all good. Only problem was the food took forever to come out. I felt like we waited 45 minutes for it. Luckily the food was good & I was able to get my cocktails from the bar taken care of due to my steak being overcooked. Thank you for that!!\nThere were some staff in the dinning room area wearing white suit jackets, when I first saw someone in one I thought I was in a spa. I didn't think they looked good & were a little tacky. Definitely didn't go with the restaurant ambiance or the other staff members who didn't have to wear them. Maybe time to throw the jackets away?\nI definitely will rant & rave about this Wednesday special & be back! \nThanks Robert!!!"

I am sure we have heard that enough so I will be sure not to use it again in any Vegas related reviews ... but I had to get one in there for the heck of it. \n\nI have been to N9NE a few times (located inside the Palms Hotel & Casino near the front desk). The entrance is actually leading to an elevator right past the entrance to Ghost Bar (which is also pretty cool). The staff is very friendly and welcoming from the initial greeter to the waiter and his helper. In a town with a lot of great dining, service is the next thing to look for and N9NE delivers on both from beginning to end. It is very pricey but what \"A\" or 5 Star quality restaurant isn't? You definitely pay for what you get and it is worth it. \n\nFood is fantastic here and if you do not like something, they will not hesitate to correct that. Portions are smaller but funny thing, I walked out of there completely full. N9NE is primarily a steak house but the seafood is outstanding here as well. I didn't make it to desserts this time around but did see them at other tables and they looked amazing. \n\nI would definitely recommend N9NE for a special date night or a business dinner to impress. The atmosphere is dim lighted but not terrible and you never know who might be dining there either ... after all, it is Vegas. \n\nFavorite dish: Rock Shrimp Appetizer, these bite size gems are amazing. Be warned though because the container they come in is misleading as it is only half filled. \n\nGo out and EAT!"

We arrived just a couple minutes late and were greeted warmly by the hostess.  We were told it would be a few minutes and proceeded to wait at the bar over cocktails.  The bar was pretty empty, and we were served quickly with great drinks.  Bring a martini gal, it's important to start my night off with a good one. :)\n\nThe hostess came back, told us to pay our bar tab and we would be seated.  (I was a little surprised that a place like this wouldn't just add it onto our dinner bill, but didn't worry.)  We paid cash, the bar back came over to say thanks and clear our area and we were on our way to a cozy little nook in the restaurant...\n\nThe lobster bisque was a little brothier than I would like, but was still amazing.  I like a little richer cream, but the flavor was excellent and had lots of lobster chunks to munch on.\n\nThe wedge salad was fresh and crisp, the blue cheese dressing didn't really taste very blue chessy for people who really like blue cheese, but was still spot on for what my tastebuds were expecting.\n\nThe bone-in ribeye came a little under done, but as rare meat lovers it's not worth sending it back.  Only an overdone steak would be inedible. Blood and a cold center don't scare us, black charcoal does... hee hee.  The creamed spinach was delish and helped cook the under cooked meat a little more before it hit my mouth.  \n\nSavory flavors, a good drink, what more could one ask for?  All in all a good night.\n\nUntil the bill came.  No big deal, our drinks from the bar were on the bill.  Waiter came by, no problem, we'll take them off.  Flash forward to the bartender coming to our table accusing us of not paying our bill.  The mini-interrogation of whether we handed him the money or not was enough to kill the food and drink buzz we were reveling in. \n\nThe waiter returned said it was all fine, but my husband still felt we deserved an apology for being mistreated.  The bartender returned with an insincere, \"I'm supposed to apologize or something?\"  and with that, our nice dinner experience was ruined.  The manager never came over the see to our issue.  Sadly, this steak house is off our list of Vegas eats."

I never knew a Bone-in Ribeye existed till I ate at N9NE. It was like something out of the flintstones, HUGE and DEEELICIOUS. I couldn't  finish it. I was definitely full from the appetizers. We had a cold shellfish platter, fresh and amazing. They have wonderful seafood at a  steakhouse. But my favorite thing was the truffle fries.  I'm not a huge fan of fries but these fries could be an accompaniment to my death row meal. \n\nEveryone knows this place is modern, sleek and sexy.  It adds to the dining experience.  If you don't want to go for a long drawn out dinner, opt for the bar and have one of their specialty cocktails and an order of truffle fries. If you opt for dinner, the Bone-in Ribeye is the way to go. \n\n*Special shout out to Andy & Tiff for taking us out to an incredible dinner."

Great steaks, but my husband fell in love with the lobster mashed potatoes, he said he wanted to get up and do the \"happy dance\" they were so good.  Michael was our server, and he has got to be one of the top 3 servers I have ever had anywhere.  He was friendly, helpful and wanted to make sure we were happy.

At most places, eyes are drawn outward at windows or art on walls. Here, the walls are stark concrete and eyes are drawn inward at the reflective interior columns and the center of the circular bar in the middle of the main floor. Colored lights created the atmosphere and I don't mean bright flashy lights. It was more mood setting light and the mood was a cool ambient chill. It doesn't hurt that some of the music was from my favorite band, Lemon Jelly. \n\nOur waiter was a big man, but gentle and helpful. He recommended a wine for our meal that he honestly thought complemented our food best. It so happened to be one of the less expensive ones.  It was a light pinot and we all loved it.\n\nTwo of us were heading towards the Surf and Turf, 8 oz filet mignon, half a lobster tail, white truffle aioli and red wine sauce ($52?) and one was of us was getting just the filet mignon. But the waiter then mentioned the specials, bless him, that included veal tenderloin and king crab bernaise (same price as the steak and lobster) and I immediately switched over to the special.\n\nAbsolutely no regrets, my beef was perfect, soft like butter. Delicious with the bernaise sauce too. Surf and Turf gal and I swapped bits from our plates and while hers was good, I just loved mine.\n\nWe ordered a selection of sides, too. Mac and cheese (good, the pasta was spirals, yum), mushrooms with caramelized onions, green beans (perfectly crisp tender, even as leftovers 2 days later) and lobster mashed potatoes, a meal in itself.\n\nWe arrived fairly late in the evening, maybe 9 pm, and lingered over our food until midnight. We were one of the last to leave, and nobody ever made us feel like we should go. \n\nI really can't fault them for a single thing, everything was perfect."

It was without flavor, tough and covered with some sort of bad red sauce.  I hate to be cynical, but the only explanation I saw was the sauce was used to cover up the horrid taste of the steak.  For the first time in my 54 years, I send a dinner back.  They then brought out two porter house steaks, again covered with the red stuff.  These steaks were at least tender, but it was hard to tell what they tasted like.  The sides were some tasteless veggies and scalloped potatoes.  The scalloped potatoes were virtually inedible since they had jalapenos as the main source of flavoring.  I like dishes with hot seasonings and spices, but jalapenos can't be used as a substitute for proper flavoring.  I hate to burn any business with this sort of review, but folks must stop going to this place until changes are made that are so desperately needed, like a new chef and a dedication to getting steaks that are better than bargain bin meat at a cut rate grocer."

The two are simply too intermingled for my taste. \n\nAs for all the comments on the prices, whatever. It's Vegas, it's a steakhouse, and they spent a fortune on the place.  So yeah, it's expensive.

I stand by the place when I can say it has the best filet in town. It is always grilled to exact specifications. If you ask for medium rare, you get medium rare, which unfortunately isn't something I can say about many of the other places in town. The Bearnaise that accompanied it is outstanding as well.  \n\nAlso worth checking out is the fire chicken. It succulent, juicy and cooked to perfection.

Dress code is business casual, so we each wore a shirt with button- down collar and slacks, and seemed to fit right in with most of the people dining there.\n The Palms seems to be targeting a younger, hip crowd, so the decor at the N9ne Steakhouse was not the traditional library with dark wood motif.\nInstead it was more like a club, with purple lighting, a bar in the center and somewhat loud music and conversations.\n The food, however, was great. I had the onion soup, 12 oz. filet mignon and Julie's hot potatoes, and my friend had the clam chowder, 22 oz. porterhouse and we shared an order of sauteed mushrooms. We both thought they were the best steaks we had ever eaten.\n Prices were not cheap. The steaks were about $55 each, sides are around $12.\n Service was top- notch. Since we were older and considerably less beautiful than their target demographic, my companion, in his mid- 50's, was a little uncomfortable there, having expected a traditional steakhouse experience. I was ok with it because the food and service were so good. I half expected to see Paris and her two little dogs eating porterhouse steaks at the next table; but alas, it was not meant to be!"

However, this was the greatest meal of my life.  And folks, I'm 29, I've got a food blog, and I've had a lot of time to think about it.  I'd give it six---nay. SEVEN stars if I could.  \n\nOne may say that it may have been the company of folks I had at the table may have added unfairly to the experience (We went to N9NE as one of the stops during my epic Vegas bachelor party experience in March 2012).  Or, admittedly, I wasn't expecting N9NE to be as awesome as it was.  But I don't think so on any of these accounts...  The food was just incredible.  And Chef Barry was awesome.  More on that later.\n\nWe started off at the bar, where we had a couple of drinks and waited for our table.  the place was PACKED and it was clear that it wouldn't e easy to get a table...  However, we had a reservation.  \n\nAs we were seated, the folks in my party immediately made a few observations of the folks sitting around us.  We had a number of famous folks sitting around us...  for some reason on that evening, they were mostly sports players--everything from UFC fighters to retired hockey players.\n\nWhile all this is nice, on to the food.  We had a bunch of appetizers and the house bread (I remember specifically the pretzel-roll style house bread and the thinly-sliced Sashimi appetizer.  Both were excellent.  I was advised by one of my hosts that the Lobster Bisque soup was to die for.  However, I don't particularly care for lobster.  I decided to go (against his advice) for the Onion soup.\n\nPerhaps as foreshadowing of the awesome within, the soup was presented to me in a beautiful All-Clad pan.  Classy.  Everyone else started on their Lobster Bisque, and I dug in on my solo onion soup.\n\nTwo words - Holy crap.  It was the best soup I had in my life.  I warn you--you'll never like any other kind of onion soup ever again.  Perhaps you shouldn't get it...  It will spoil you for anything else.  Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nI ultimately did try the Lobster Bisque.  It was damn good, also.  And I'll re-iterate--I don't really care for lobster.  But it was still damn good.  I let my host that was raving about the lobster bisque try the onion soup.  He (who doesn't normally care for onion soup) actually changed his mind and said that he liked the onion soup a bit better.\n\nOn to the main course.  I ordered the 8 ounce filet.  It was of the top 5 steaks I've ever had.  Be sure to get a nice steak sauce to go with it...  I think I either had the peppercorn or the horseradish.  But yes, the steak was cooked perfectly and outstanding.\n\nFinally, on to dessert!  We had two dessert dishes that we sampled--the S'mores and the Donuts.  They were both awesome...  I especially loved the presentation of the S'mores.  In a nutshell, dessert was just as impressive as the courses that came before it.\n\nAfter the meal, I only had one request.  I wanted to meet the chef.  Luckily, my host happened to know Chef Barry and was able to pull him away for a couple of minutes.  As icing on the cake, let me tell you--Chef Barry's one in a million.  He's one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.  I had an opportunity to take my picture with him and his famous \"door.\"  (If you have the means--it's an awesome photo opp...)  I wish I had thought to ask Chef Barry for his autograph.\n\nIn short, this is the kind of restaurant which I'd consider taking a vacation contingent upon eating here again.  Sure, it's quite expensive, but it is OUT of this WORLD.  You'll get your money's worth...  And you were probably going to go blow all that cash in a slot machine anyway.  Skip it and savor the flavors of N9NE.  Shame on you if you go to Vegas and don't eat there.  Make your reservations as far in advance as possible."

Visiting Las Vegas from Rhode Island, of course we had to stop here seeing the executive chef is a RI Native and that certainly shows in his food. The scallop appetizer and empanadas were amazing! I had a filet topped with lobster and my husband had lamb chops pecan crusted! Again, amazing! My filet was the most tender steak I have ever had! Taste and cook to perfection! Dessert, was smores, made with house made marshmallows! Stop here, now! Best meal in vegas for sure!"

Hubby and I shared the Rib Eye for 2 for $89. It comes with a twice baked potato and that's it...but it's so much meat that is really all you need.  We ate all we could and had a ton left over.  The s'mores are super yummy and fun to eat for dessert. I have a hard time eating a steak any place else because I always compare it to the steaks I've eaten at n9ne."

            "review": "I believe in some cases that the harder they try, the more harshly you should judge them.  Thus is my approach to reviewing N9NE, which (much like the clientele at the Palms) goes all out to show you how hip it can be and hopes you will overlook some details.  The ambiance was nice, the food was decent but not great and the overall experience was just ok.  2.5 stars and I will break my rounding-up trend for aforementioned reasons.\n\nOur appetizers were the popcorn shrimp and the crab-stuffed mushrooms.  I'd say they were enjoyable, but for the price they should have been much better.\n\nFor my main course, I had the bone-in ribeye (the cut I always order) and a side of lobster mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked as requested, and it's pretty good meat, comparable to Ruth's Chris.  I've certainly had better steaks for the money, but there was nothing wrong with it.  My other friends' steaks were similar in that they were satisfying but not amazing.  The lobster mashed potatoes were a bit of a disappointment, I wish I had gone with a baked potato.\n\nWe skipped dessert because of the quality of the meal and the fact that we started our meal really late.  Props to the (rather gorgeous) hostess who was very friendly and accommodating.  She seated us a good 30 minutes after our reservation time (which was the last time slot at which they would take one), and I think they might have even kept the kitchen open for us.   That's great service.\n\nApparently, you can't bring in outside wine, which sucked for us because one of the guys in our group works at a winery and had some amazing wine with him.  N9NE claims that it's a state law (I have a feeling that's not true, but what do I know).\n\nOne of the things that brought this review down to two stars was at the very end of the meal.  Our server already wasn't that attentive, maybe she was annoyed with the late seating or the fact that we didn't buy a bottle of wine.  But at the end of the meal, after she had run our cards and brought the credit card slips to the table, she told us: \"now sign one copy and leave it for the restaurant.\"  \n\nAre you serious?  Anyone dropping this kind of money on a meal has clearly eaten at a sit-down restaurant before and knows how to pay the fucking bill.  It's possible this is a standard instruction, but based on her tone I am quite sure it's not.  Also, of all the times you could possibly offend your customers, why would you do it as close as possible to when they decide how much to tip?"

We called around 8:30 pm after we were too late to make our original reservations somewhere else. We were able to come in by 9 pm and got seated right away.\n\nOur server was very professional and knowledgeable about the menu. He informed us of any specials and suggestions he had. We ordered our drinks right away and had two orders each of the tuna tartar and calamari to share with the table. The tuna tartar was served with avocado, very fresh and tasty. The calamari was good, but nothing too special aside from being served with slices of peppercinis and jalapeno for an extra spice.\n\nThe entrees took some time to come out, which was fine since we were enjoying ourselves plus it was expected. But once they finally came out, they were all juicy and so flavorful looking. I didn't ask for extra sauce on mine, but towards the end I feel like I should have. I had the 8 oz filet mignon cooked medium rare. The meat wasn't exactly melt in your mouth soft, but it was tasty. Everyone seemed to enjoy their plates and we also ordered some sides to share including creamed spinach, potatoes au gratin, and fries.\n\nI was already full with a quarter of my filet still left and none of us had room for dessert. The bill was estimated around $100 per person, which is pretty average at a steakhouse considering we had 2 bottles of wine and all the sides + apps additional to our plates. It wasn't the best cut of meat I've had, but the dining experience in all was enjoyable and the service was really great."

            "review": "After Palms Place compensated us for an issue with our room, my friends and I decided to splurge on a nice dinner for NYE.\n\nN9NE Steakhouse is located at the Palms Hotel on the first floor next to the registration desk. Walking in, I instantly got an \"underground\" vibe from this restaurant. You know, a secluded, upscale establishment where businessmen, mobsters, and the like gather. I would feel out of place wearing anything less than business casual.\n\nThe mood was festive. There was a DJ spinning and music could be heard (and felt) coming from next door. It was fairly loud, but not to the point of making conversation difficult. \n\nHowever, there was one thing that I didn't quite understand. Given the upscale nature of this restaurant, the TV's showing college football didn't really fit in. But then again, most upscale restaurants don't have a DJ either.\n\nAs for the food...\n\nThe French Onion Soup. Best I've ever had, hands down. Lots of delicious, melted cheese, caramelized onions, tasty bread, and broth. No cheap ingredients here. The serving was generous, so I split it with Dawn M.\n\nOrganic Fire Chicken. Cooked to perfection. Juicy, tender meat served in a spicy-ish glaze and topped with an assortment of jalapenos. The meat was tender and arrived at the ideal temperature.\n\nAsparagus. Since most of the entrees are a la carte, I needed a side for my chicken. I went with the asparagus. Nothing extraordinary here- maybe a little mushy, if anything.\n\nSalmon. I don't eat seafood (lame, I know). Dawn M. and another one of our friends claimed that it was the \"best they've ever had\". Strong words!\n\nOverall, we had a wonderful meal. The service was professional and not overbearing. While the food was delicious, I still think it was a little overpriced (perhaps due to NYE). Without even ordering steak or wine, our bill totaled over $300 (5 people). I'm also not a fan of charging $30 for chicken and not including any sides. Anyway, cost complaints aside, I enjoyed my experience at N9NE and would consider returning for another special occasion."

He even checked before making wine recommendations to see if we needed anything new or wanted to stay the course.\n\nThe meal was great too and the portion sizes were just right.

Made a reservation and came in the dine here at the Palms, N9NE hiding in the corner by the ivory tower. We started with some drinks at the park. my best friend order some wine and said it was the best one she had, ended up ordering another, that drunky. :) i ordered a beer and then we were taken to our table by the host. \n\nthe server we had was amazing, really helpful guy. he gave us the chef specials for the day as well as walked us through the menu. we ordered the chef special app to start. the also brought over bread which was delicious, some were pretzel like other had a little cheese on them, great start to the meal. they also brought out some small apps and sticks that included tomatoes, peppers, and olives. they weren't anything crazy special but was still cool to fill in space between apps and meal. then came the STEAKS!! Ally ordered the filet 10oz i believe, me and Niy Niy order the same meal and i could barely finish it. 12 Oz was too much for me, also with our side. We also order the gnocchi (which i heard was amazing and i heard right!) mac and cheese which had the twisty pasta which i thought was cool and delicious, and also lobster mashed potatoes.. not a huge fan but Niy likes. then i made the big mistake... i order the smores. they came with their own little fire, different marshmallow and chocolate... but it was way too much, i stuffed myself the top!\n\nOverall the experience was excellent. i hope to go back and maybe order a little less."

He was worried we'd be too full to enjoy dinner...never underestimate the power of this bottomless pit!\n\nWe sat at the bar and had the most amazing service from the two bartenders especially Roberto. They really took care of us and I mean REALLY took care of us. We had a sangria and a Hoegaarden while waiting for our food. The bread service was quite enjoyable: pretzel, onion, bacon and mildly sweet muffin.  I looked at their menu beforehand to see if there was anything else aside from the gnocchi I wanted to try. I wasn't too thrilled by their prix fixe menu but I did see a few things that really caught my interest: Kobe burger with truffle cheese and truffle fries. Some unreliable source suggested the lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nGnocchi:\nWith white truffle cream. I looooove gnocchi and I loooooooooove truffles. Together? Absolute madness! It was exactly how I had imagined it to be. I was not disappointed at all. The gnocchi was tender and they were like tiny pillows my tongue can rest on. The truffle cream sauce was wonderful - I dipped everything in it. This has got to be my favorite version of gnocchi.  5/5\n\nKobe Burger with Truffle Fries:\nPancetta, balsamic onions, truffle cheese, + thick-cut fries with parmesan cheese and truffle aioli. It also came with toasted mustard seed ketchup and roasted garlic aioli. We split this and it was a perfect medium-rare - just how we like our beef. It was juicy. I couldn't taste the truffle cheese though. Put some truffle aioli and we're good to go. The fries were thick and not super crispy but give me starch and truffle aioli then I'm good. I finished the truffle fries like a champ! 4.5/5\n\nLobster Mashed Potatoes:\nMaine lobster and mashed Yukon potatoes. This was pretty good and there was a good amount of lobster on top but there's something missing - this is not my favorite version. I like Mastro's the most. 3/5\n\nRock Shrimp:\nLightly breaded and fried shrimps with lemon aioli and Sriracha sauce. I wasn't paying attention to what Roberto said about the Sriracha sauce so I dipped a shrimp in there and it sure taught me a lesson! The lemon aioli was great. Citrusy and creamy. 4/5\n\nWe got complimentary carrot cupcakes. We walked away paying only $57 + tax and tip for everything we ate and drank...that's what happens when a guy shows a little cleavage! I'll definitely come back for more gnocchi."

I...don't know if it was or wasn't. I can't call it a two, but it's not a four either. I hope for four when I'm spending this kind of money.\n\nFiguring we'd have plenty of beef, we headed right for the main course. I had a bone-in filet, and my friend had a bone in ribeye. The filet was cooked a little past my preferred medium rare, and also wasn't terribly tender for a filet - I think I've had better melt in your mouth beef at places like Ruth's Chris and III Forks. Flavor, even for a filet, was also low. I know I should have avoided it, but I'd never had a bone-in filet...and it came recommended, so I went with it. It also tasted like it was in a little bit of a brown broth...which had plenty of salt in it, but I'd rather have had a salt and pepper crust instead of a little bit of that sauce.\n\nSides were fine - asparagus was really quite good, and creamed corn was fine, although definitely not up to par with the heavenly creamed corn from III Forks in Dallas. They're also a bit pricey, although they're of a decent size.\n\nMy companion's ribeye sounded (and looked) better than my filet. It was also truly huge - 24oz weight, and he had a struggle to get it all down. Fortunately, he was aided by the creamed corn. Quote: \"If I have a little more creamed corn, I think I'll be OK.\"\n\nThe atmosphere is definitely not the classic steakhouse. And they're proud of that fact. LED mood lighting, bumping bass-y techno through the sound system, etc. I think I prefer the more classic steakhouse atmosphere, like I had last year in Vegas at The Foundation Room. Service was attentive, so that was fine. Of particular note, the hostess was...surgically augmented...in spectacular fashion. Whoever did the work needs to get a medal. And finally, price. A little high, I thought for quality, etc. Even in Vegas, this is a bit off strip, so I had been hoping it wouldn't be as high as it was.\n\nWould I go back? Actually, no. Usually that's the metric for my 3 star review, but in this case, it's not that it's bad, it's just that it isn't good enough to return given the hundreds of steakhouses that seem to be up and down the strip. I'm still looking for an oh-my-god spot. Maybe I'll find it next time."

So trying to make a reservation at 4PM for 7 at 7 on a Saturday night wasn't very easy. Called around before finding N9ne that could accomodate our group for a birthday. \n\nMust say that although I enjoyed the total experience they could do with some changes to the interior, it is somewhat of a cold interior like mentioned in other reviews. Could use some interesting art & lighting. Got seated in the private dining area, which was even more bland. But dining with a group is never bland! And our group definitely lit that place up.\n\nAt the beginning of the meal I wasn't very impressed with our waiter, he was a little cold and made an odd remark or two. However, he did warm up or maybe we warmed up to him by the first round of drinks. He was funny and accomodating with pictures. He also brought us complimentary shots after our meal which were soooo delish. And although we didn't order dessert because we were in a rush he brought out mini cupcakes for the table. The entire group was happy with his service and attention.\n\nNow to the food!\n\nI had the Organic Fire chicken and Lobster mash potatoes. Both Amazing. Most steak houses lack a good chicken dish, but this had a lot of flavor, moist and cooked to perfection. Mashed potatoes had many chunks of lobster, soooo good.\n\nHalf the table had the Surf and Turf and they gushed over it! They all found the steak to be cooked to perfection and the lobster succulent. No complaints from all four that had it. \n\nThe only meal not enjoyed at the table was the Black Pepper Fettuccini."

Unfortunately we were doing dinner the night before (just how our schedule happen to fall) so she was unable to drink, but hey I did! \n\nAll your steak house classics! There were some high notes, but also some low.  We shared the popcorn shrimp, tuna tartare and stuffed mushrooms to start off with. The popcorn shrimp was really good! I love the dipping sauce it was served with. Served ever so cutely in a popcorn box, which I read that some called it tacky, but I thought it was uber cute! The tuna tartare was another favorite. Fresh and delicious. Stuffed mushrooms were good, but my least favorite out of the three. \n\nNext came our caesar salad. No complaints here! Served with a crispy parmesan toast and a little piece of smoky bacon that was just perfect. We then shared the chicken, rib eye steak, linguini pasta for our entrees and for our sides we had the potato gnocchi and asparagus. The highlight for me was probably the chicken. It had a nice spice to it. It was served in some sort of jalapeno lemon sauce that was seriously good! The steak on the other hand didn't really blow me away. I asked for medium rare and it came out rare. I know it's a very small scale from the two but I just don't like my steak that red. Flavors of the steak was okay, I thought it lacked a little seasoning. But I guess what my steak lack, it made with in the pasta. It was so overly salty. I wasn't a huge fan. But when eaten in the same bite, it wasn't too bad. It was my first time trying gnocchi and it was kind weird. I just don't think I'm a fan of gnocchi in general so I can't really critique it. \n\nThen for dessert we roasted some s'mores at our table, which was really fun and a great presentation. We also had some carrot cake which I heard my girlfriend say was dry but I was already too stuffed to the gills to even try. \n\nOverall, my meal was pretty good.

We wer the only ones in the restaurant as we were seated. We started off with dirty martinis and they were made to perfection. The waiter was attentive, explained the menu and answered any of our questions. We ordered a little bit of everything and there was nothing that we did not like. As the night went on, a few more martinis we got a little louder but the waiter kept up with us. At the end of the night the chef even brought us a sample of desserts and took  a picture with me. Can't wait to go back. Great 5 star experience!"

This time around, me and my buddy planned to get our grub on at N9NE Steakhouse for dinner.\n\nThis is not the usual steakhouse where it is quiet and has wooden furniture in the interior.  Of course it doesn't because this is Vegas and the restaurant is in the Palms Casino.  The restaurant's decor is very trendy as one would expect based on the location.  It has some music bumping in the background of everyone's conversation and it is dimly lit with neon lights accenting the ceiling.\n\nI really enjoyed the food.  Maybe I enjoyed the food so much because it was my first meal of the day and it was 7pm.  Who knows but it was good.\n\nSkinny fries:  Forget about getting this one.  These things were not skinny but were extremely anorexic.  They were like the size of a headphone string.\n\nShrooms:  Get this mushroom lovers.  Nice sized mushrooms with lots of flavor from both the mushrooms and the crab stuffing.\n\nGeorge's creamed corn:  For anyone that loves corn that is rich.\n\nGarlic green beans:  The only greens that was ordered which wasn't a lot but good enough.  They're very small and the garlic flavor is not overpowering.\n\nBone-in rib eye: 24 oz of pure meat.  Perfect for my carnivore appetite.  I am starting to think that charring the meat is the thing to do which this place did.  I don't prefer it, but it still was good.  The meat was tender and juicy.  And I almost finished the entire thing but left about an oz.  That's how good it was.\n\nThis was a great meal and I was not disappointed.  \n\nFor those asking \"So how much does it cost?\" \n-Expect to pay about $100 with tip (this is based on 1 appetizer, 1 side, and 1 entree).\n\nWould I go again? Sure I would but I can't since there are so many restaurants here.   I plan on trying them before I started coming back for seconds."

Food was 8/10 for me. we started off with sashimi and lobster bisque. Sashimi was ok but that lobster bisque was delicious. main course was one boneless ribeye for the lady and I settled with a dry aged bone in ribeye both with foie gras. accompanied with cream of spinach and truffle fries. sides were pretty darn tasty and the steaks were good but I had better. don't get me wrong I enjoyed it very much and will order it again. for dessert, compliments of the house was a fun platter of s'mores 3 kinds: dark n white chocolate and Nutella for two. overall our experience was delightful and the reason I gave 5 stars is because of the hospitality. I believe our servers name was Marco. Thanks to him n 9 for a wonderful evening."

Mood was festive for everyone that hadn't had their teeth kicked in by the total a-hole dealers at Venetian, but whatever, I don't totally blame Nine for that.  Bone in ribeye was excellent, I usually hate it when sauce come on the meat, but for me this au jus stuff worked, didn't overwhelm the beef at all.  Sides may have been the best part.  The gnocchi truffle side is about as good as it gets, and the death by potato was killer.  Wine list excellent as well, pricy as should be expected but with a number of relatively cheap but still good ones.  So why only 4 stars? One of my friends ordered rare, it came out medium.  He politely asked for a new steak.  Demon lady (not our server, not a manager, not sure who the hell she was actually) tells my friend he is wrong and that he doesn't know what he's talking about.  Food is one thing that you never doubt this dude on.  She then brings out a flashlight and shines it on the meat, cuts to the bone, and says \"See, look, that's rare.\"  Well, yeah, the 2mm around the bone is red, congratulations demon lady.  Long story short, my friend ends up in the kitchen talking to the chef (who seemed cool enough), chef admits the steak is medium, not rare, and says he'll send a shrimp cocktail over.  Of course the freebie peace offering never comes probably because demon lady (who most likely had put on a spelunking style flashlight helmet on for more bogus meat inspections) was hunkered down on the crapper eating our shrimp cocktail.  The whole issue was actually pretty damn funny and made the dinner more entertaining.  So screw it... 5 stars.  One last thing, we saw smores being served which looked good so I told the squirrelly bus boy (who by the way just laughed and laughed all night long for no apparent reason - especially at our non-PC jokes which he really probably shouldn't have been laughing at) that I'd pay him to bring us over a free order of smores, and he just laughed again which I took as acceptance, but sure enough, just like the shrimp cocktail, it was a no show.  I have a strange feeling that demon lady and crazy laughing busboy spent the better part of our meal feeding each other shrimp and smores in a dark closet somewhere, lit only by the glow of a coal miner's helmet light. Spooky."

The atmosphere is very modern and the lighting good.\n\nWe started off with the prawn cocktail and the calamari. The prawns were delicious and the calamari was a 10. I usually don't care for calamari because it tends to be rubbery but this calamari was soft and cooked perfectly. After the appetizers, I had the bone-in-ribeye steak and it was fantastic. Cooked to perfection, served with a side of skinny fries. Robert, our waiter, couldn't have been better. Very attentive and very knowledgeable. I also ordered a bottle of Jordan wine but after about 10 minutes, they couldn't find any. They gave me a better bottle of wine for the same price. I was going to deduct a star for that little mishap but since I got a better bottle of wine, the star stays.\n\nRobert also got us entrance to the Ghostbar, props.

We ordered pretty quickly since we were all so hungry BUT waited 1 hour to get our food. We were 8 hungry women getting a lil' impatient\nand irritated, as you can imagine. The manager, Kat, did come out to apologize for the long wait and said she'd take care of it on the back end. The waiter came back out and told us that the manager would escort us to the club for a free entrance to compensate for their poor service. It was a nice gesture, but very weak, we thought. We are all girls and can get into any club for free in Vegas. Anyway, our food came out and was good, but nothing amazing worth over 3 stars. My filet mignon was burnt on the outside and it sure didn't melt in my mouth like I would expect at any other 4 star restaurant. My girlfriend who was pregnant specifically told our waiter and asked for her meat to be cooked well done, but came out pink in the middle anyawu. I can probably go on and on... The worse part was when we asked to talk to the manager at the end of our meal, it took her a good 15 minutes to come. I would think if you already knew customers were having issues, she would be there quickly. Not here. Despite all that, she did take a portion off our bill, but the fact that she had an attitude and was not apologetic at all, still left a bad taste in our mouths. It's unfortuante that we came to this restaurant expecting a 4 star experience but left unhappy, unsatisfied and irritated. Will never come back nor recommend this place to anyone even if it was free. I don't care how good the food is. If the service sucks, it's not worth it, in my opinion. Sorry."

I tried to cut away the outside of the burger but by the time I managed to do all that, the burger was completely unappetizing.  I had a few bites but not wanting to risk my health, I barely ate any of it.  The waiter noticed that I had not eaten much of the burger and asked what was wrong.

It came out a little more towards the rare side. I really enjoyed this burger and it easily became one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Of course the applewood smoked bacon didn't hurt either =)After reading about those lobster mashed potatoes I knew I had to try those as well so the bartender was happy to substitute them for the fries. They were also awesome. \nYea, I said bartender. I opted to sit at the bar since I knew I wasn't going to be able to afford a full course meal here. The service at the bar was pretty good. The bar tender was nice enough. He did seem to know everyone who walked through the door so he kept stopping to chat with them and therefore i was kind of neglected once or twice. Little did he know that at the rate I drink he easily could have brought me 2 or 3 more beers and his tip would have been larger. \nBefore the kobe beef deliciousness I had the Jumbo Lump Crab appetizer, awesome. The crab was served three ways and all three were very tasty. The person I was dining with had the salmon entr\u00e9e and he said it was amazing.  \nOverall, the food was great. The atmosphere was comfortable. And at only a little over $110(not including tip), for 2 people, with 2 drinks I still had money for the rest of my vacation. So eating here can definitely be semi-affordable if you show restraint."

Not snooty like you would expect in the place -- I was very frank about where my favorite place in town was, and he was okay with it. The level of service, including how soon they came back to check on us, was about perfect.\n\nThe food came promptly, and the drinks were strong (maybe a bit too strong).

At first I thought I just caught them on a off night but after 4 tries I've given up.\n\nEach time i've gone everything has just been okay, and my steak has always been over cooked.\n\nThe last time I attempted to eat here I was with a buddy of mine who use to play basketball.  After we ordered the chef came out to meet him and everyone at our table.  I thought for sure this time I was going to get their best effort.  I was wrong.  I ordered the bone in fillet medium, it came out well-done.  There was zero pink.  I would have sent it back but we were in a bit of a hurry.\n\nI figure if this is what i'm getting while i'm with a semi-celeb  there is just no hope.  Everything else was just alright, apps and side nothing special.  N9NE is off my places to eat in vegas but I'm sure I will be back because of the name and someone will always want to try it out.  \n\nFor the price you pay here you have a lot of options for a steak dinner.  I would try somewhere else."

I have yet to have a steak better than Sullivan's yet I continue to try and experiment with other places. The steak here, while a good cut, was not flavored/seasoned well at all. I prefer more of a peppery seasoning and this was completely lacking. I would not go back for the steak. \n\nHowever, the atmosphere was kind of cool. It's like eating dinner in a nightclub but without the crowd. The music they play was getting me in the mood to go out afterwards so I really liked that. The drinks were pretty good and our server was great!\n\nTake the food out of the equation I give the place 4 stars. But paying $60 for a steak, the food weighed a lot on my rating."

I ordered their surf and turf, and it was delicious! Many of the items on their menu could be very pricey. Also, please be wary that you should get your steaks a litlte bit more rare than you're used to. Don't try to get it well-done if you like your steaks that way.

This restaurant is not for the faint of heart monetarily, it's quite pricey, however the food is well worth the cost.  The pretzel rolls are to die for and the garbage salad is great! We opted for the price fixed menu at 60.00 p/person because we had the children with us. This menu had good selections and an additional appetizer surprise from the chef. Outstanding!\nThis menu included wine parings with each course, here's where  they fell short of perfection. We were never offered our wine, never. We finally asked at the end of the meal about the wine, she casually brushed it off and offered a glass when dinner was finished.  To me, customer service would dictate offering an after dinner cognac or port, or at the very least an admission of error, but nothing was done about it. Don't let that stop you from going, if you choose price fixed just stay on top of your main server.  \nI would definitely go back, the food us fantastic, service is good, and ambiance is great, if not for the wine pairings, they would have gotten 5 stars from me."

I am SO glad I finally chose N9NE, because it was incredible.\n\nWe got there on time for our 6:30 reservation and were seated immediately.  Our seat was a little weird table facing the back of the restaurant, where we both sat on the same side on a bench seat.  It was still cool, though.  It wasn't totally busy yet, so the fun ambiance didn't kick into gear for a bit.  It was exactly the scene I was looking for though - loud music, hot people, bustling service.  Fun and extravagant at the same time.\n\nNow, I should probably deduct something because the first plate of calamari that came out was totally rubbery.  But, as a good restaurant should, they promptly replaced it with a better plate.  I would have probably been happier had it been comped entirely, since I am apparently a calamari traditionalist and didn't care for the peppers.  But, they still did the next best thing, and that goes a long way with me.\n\nThe little brioche muffins were so good - I'm glad they were little and that there were only two, because I could have spoiled my appetite eating them.  YUM!  \n\nFor the main course I ordered the Surf and Turf (filet topped with lobster and drizzled with truffle aioli).  It was cooked perfectly (medium rare for me), and the combination of tender, sweet lobster, steak and truffle aioli was pretty damn near orgasmic.  \nMy husband got the bone-in filet which wasn't as evenly cooked as mine, but the portion close to the bone was fantastic.\nWe shared the macaroni and cheese, and it was absolutely perfect - creamy, cheesy goodness.\nAs full as we were, we HAD to get dessert, and I insisted on the doughnuts.  SO glad I did.  They were piping hot and fresh, and the caramel dip was over the top delicious.  They went especially well with the coffee we were drinking to ensure we could stay up as late as we were planning (we're old folks and usually go to bed early - but not in Vegas, baby!)\n\nWith as many awesome choices for restaurants as there are in Vegas, I have already told my husband we are coming back here next time!"

My friend tried the North Atlantic Salmon and seemed to like it really well.\n\nI had a couple glasses of a 2013 Syrah from Central Coast, California, and was rather impressed with the acidity; it's smoky, pepper-like taste on the palate was a great compliment to the steak. My friend tried a similar vintage Chardonnay from California to pair the salmon, and also seemed to enjoy it as well.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the dinner, but waiting for 30 minutes past our reservation time, and having the steak a little over-cooked was enough to reduce it by two stars, and for $260?

Second, Hanks has been given a huge challenge: who is going to get my money from here on out?\n\nThe essentials:\nHAVE A RESERVATION. Chances are you won't get in without one. During the week this place caters to business diners, and large groups & several parties of them. Mine was a party of 10. \n\nThe lobster bisque is the most divine dish ever created. Here any way. And they're jokesters about it too. A large bowl with lobster bits is set before you. You are given time to process this culinary oddity and ask yourself, \"Is this it?\" when the bisque is then poured into your bowl from a steaming steel cylinder, previously hidden behind your servers back. If you think lobster bisque is not for you or you don't like it...TRY IT HERE. Guaranteed you'll love it!!\n\nIf you order water, have no intention on tipping your server, have a budget or $20 & your last $20 is in your pocket...it is imperative you order the LOBSTER MASH. A side item, this is large enough to be its own meal. Chunks (not pieces) of lobster sits atop a mound of creamy carb goodness.  Mix it up or don't, this side item delight will have you craving it for days. \n\nAs a general rule I never order Caesar salad...anywhere. I find it to be seriously over priced everywhere for what it is; unlike ranch, Caesar dressing varies in taste & texture from one place to the next; and I'm not keen on searching for hidden fish (anchovies) in my salad before I can eat it. It's replaced the \"garden salad\" & falsely implies a sophisticated palate. It's just plain and boring. Except here. \n\nBacon caesar salad. I'm a fan of the pig and I never thought to add bacon to this salad. I'm not talking bacon bits. I am talking about proper pieces if bacon. Thick cut. Cooked. Not fatty. Chunks. Of. Bacon. Generous amounts of bacon. Bacon. Bacon. Bacon. We did a split plate on this and the portion was just right.  I can't continue to write about this salad...I'm salivating over my words. \n\nAs I mentioned mine was a party if 10. We were seated at 6pm and left at 9:30pm. Our server was AMAZING. Her recommendations were genuine & honest, she never broke a sweat & remained in control. She made it look easy, serving our lot. I wish I knew her name. Tall, slender, short hair.\n\nSo why 3 stars?  I love Hanks for its comfortable & classy atmosphere & seating. I found N9NE to be sterile, uncomfortable, and plain. It lacked character. It wasn't inviting. The bar area was much more inviting & had character & ambiance. I will definitely be back for the above 3 items, but I'll enjoy them in the bar."

Easy ordering, help with the menu when my friends needed it (I literally have dreams about eating here, so I was set.) My only disappointment was that the 3lb lobster thermidor had been taken off menu, a sad fact mitigated by Robert offering to have the twin lobster tails cooked thermidor style instead. Seeing as everyone else was going with steaks, I figured I'd follow suit and got my 22 Oz ribeye, rare (warm, red center), and got it oscar style. First bite almost made me cry. This is how steak should be prepared. Pure perfection. The crab was excellent as well, although this time around was a touch skimpy on the bernaise sauce. This was easily overlooked by the sheer quality of the rest of the meal. As always, the lobster mashed potatoes are a MUST. Giant chunks of lobster amid fluffy, buttery potatoes. Delicious. Friends around the room also loved the gnocchi and lobster Mac and cheese. I've said it before and I'll say it again: I'll eat at N9NE every time I come to Las Vegas. It's the best meal you'll have for a long, long time."

I can't wait to go back for round 2!\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n1. The hostesses are actually nice! This seems so rare in the fancier steakhouses.  It was a nice way to start the night.\n\n2. Awesome bartenders and strong drinks!  We actually arrived a bit early, so we headed to the bar for a cocktail.  It turns out it was Ladies Night, which is every Wednesday.  They had several drinks for $5 and apps for $9.  Not too shabby!\n\n3. The atmosphere is beautiful! The GM, who stopped by our table to chat, told us it was recently remodeled.  It is very pretty and the new booth seating is quite comfy. Nothing is better than great food and being comfortable as you totally pig out! \n\n4. OhMyGoodness the FOOD!!!!! We had some awesome food on this visit.  I think I got pictures of almost everything, but they don't do the food justice.  Everything was fantastic! I am still thinking about my amazing Classic Ribeye and the Hot Potatoes Austin Gratin.  Of course, the memories of the Crab Stuffed Mushrooms, Potato Gnocchi, Creamed Corn, and Buffalo Chicken Wontons keep fighting for space too! Ok, I just drooled on the keyboard!\n\n5. OhMyGoodness the sommelier and the wine pairings for the night!  I am totally not a wine person.  I have never really acquired the taste for wine, so I usually just skip it all together.  This night though, we had an awesome sommelier take care of us for dinner.  He made me totally rethink my stance on wine! We started with Pierre Joliot Champagne to celebrate some fun stuff going on in our lives right now and then it just keep coming.  I can't remember the names of all of the of other wines we had, but they were all fantastic! If you have the chance, ask for Marco and his sommelier services for the night.  He is totally worth it!\n\n6. The desserts! We had the Banana Pudding Pie and the S'mores.  Both were so fun and yummy.  I would have to recommend the s'mores though because it was so much fun!  You get fire at your table, in-house made marshmallows in plain, strawberry, banana, and chocolate flavors, and graham crackers already loaded with chocolate! Yummy!\n\n7. We even got to meet the Chef! It's always so much fun to have the Chef come out to meet you.  Nice touch N9NE!\n\n8. I almost forgot to mention the B\u00e9arnaise!!! I love love love B\u00e9arnaise sauce.  The B\u00e9arnaise sauce here was ah-ma-zing! My sister and I were fighting over the last drop.  The other three sauces were tasty and I would recommend you get all four and play around with them, but the B\u00e9arnaise is definitely the best of the four!\n\n9. And last by not least, the service! Our server was fantastic! Everyone we encountered through the meal was great.  Everyone was en pointe and giving 110%.  This is really what sealed the deal on this fabulous meal.  We felt like royalty the entire meal!!!\n\nThis meal was easily in my top 5 of all time.  My sister and I had such a great time! I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone that would listen to me!"

Really five out of five service and attention.  Every meal I have had here has relied on great service.\n\nThe food was slightly less great than my memory suggested it would be. Mind you I was dining in a larger (cost conscious) group that really affected my ordering - you dont want to be the only one ordering appetizers and desserts right?\n\nMy bone in filet was slightly more pink than I would have liked for a medium temp, I think the bone made matters more tricky for the cook, but at $60 you really want perfection.  Also, the skinny fries were more like shoestring/matchstick fries."

I'll rate them all based on the same criteria.   I've been to N9ne twice now in the past few months and I will go back.  My first experience was just OK but the last was outstanding.  This is the average (4 stars overall) for each part of the experience:\n\nDecor = 5 stars based on my preference for contemporary spaces.\n\nBar experience = 4 stars for attentive service from attractive bartenders.  Strong drinks but a bit pricey ($14)\n\nCrowd = 5 stars.  Its a well dressed young crowd with older high rollers mixed in.  Most people stop off here on their way out on the town for the night and are dressed accordingly.\n\nOverall food = 4 stars.  The bread is fresh and a nice assortment.  Sides are exactly as expected.  Don't order the surf and turf though becasue the lobster tail is small and isn't fresh.  DO try the lobster mashed potatoes though.\n\nThe steak = 4 stars.  My first Porterhouse was average.  Well cooked but a bit light on flavor.  My second was a bone-in rib-eye which was outstanding.\n\nWine = 4 stars for a solid wine list.  Affordable bottles are sprinkled in among notable high end wines and notable vinatage cellar wines.  Markup is 40 to 50% as expected.\n\nService = 5 stars for my taste as I prefer approachable over stuffy.  Servers are friendly, funny, knowledgable, and honest.  You don't feel like they are trying to upsell.  Trust their recommendations on food and wine. They also brought us a complimentary pot sticker appetizer to start.  Little things go a long way.\n\nThe check = $125 per person with steak, side, desert, and wine\n\nRecommended."

Very delicious, very filling.  the dry aged meat offers a nice little kick for your taste buds.\n\nShe had a Kobe Burger and this thing was giant.

I genuinely love this set of friends that comes to town from time to time and not just because they buy me nice meals; they love good meals and they invite me to go out with them to places I would never ordinarily go. N9NE wasn't even in my bookmarks--that's how much I never thought I would go there--but I really enjoyed my time and food. \n\nCompliments of the chef because my friends are just that cool: rock shrimp and buffalo chicken wontons. Not a huge shellfish fan but when it's breaded and fried I suppose I can get behind it. The buffalo chicken wontons were awesome but I probably wouldn't order them. I would rather save stomach room for steak and salad, or a steak salad if such a thing exists here. \n\nI started with the soup du jour, tomato bisque. This was among the greatest tomato soups I have ever had--it had a strong tomato flavor, but you could also tell it was very carrot-y and bell pepper-y. It was served with a little grilled cheese, too... Comfort food at its very finest. \n\nI had a bite of a goat cheese salad and the bacon Caesar. The bacon on the Caesar was so smokey and delicious. More melt-in-your-mouth than M&Ms, I tell ya. It was like eating campfire, but in the best way possible. I would get this if I were to ever go back. \n\nMy filet arrived--medium rare because I'm from the Midwest and why would I ruin a cut of meat by overcooking it? If you're still ordering above medium rare, ur doin it rong. It had a really light sauce on it which I liked because it didn't overpower the meat. The steak itself was charred to perfection and was good. I won't say excellent because again, I'm from the Midwest and we know steak there, but it was a really delicious piece of meat.\n\nFor dessert, again compliments of the chef, we had three choices, but the standout was the s'mores creation station. We all agreed that we feel sorry for people who only get to make s'mores off of little gas gel pots and barbecue grills...campfires are the way to go on this one. But how fun and spectacular that they have this little end of meal treat.\n\nService was awesome--we were joking with our servers all night long and they kept throwing things on our table free of charge. I can't say to expect that from every server and every table, but it's definitely good to know people.\n\nI probably won't be back because hey, I'm not made of money, but I really enjoyed my experience here and if you want a huge splurge, go for it."

I have had much better steaks at Maestro's City Hall and even Flemmings (which doesn't say much). I ordered my steak medium and it came out mooing. Gross....  We ordered the gnocchi ( gross, everyone who thinks these are good must have the taste buds of a three year old, I mean seriously these tasted like perogies... real gnocchi is served at Quiessence), string fries (pretty good), and garlic mashed potatoes (typical steak house potatoes) for sides. After a horrible dinner which I could barely eat I decided to order a few desserts because I will still hungry. I ordered the Oreo cake (pretty good in taste but the texture was too soft like it had been sitting out for awhile), the apple pie (SUCKED), and the smores (were fun, but not really tasty).\n\nThe wine and alcohol selection here is amazing. I did get my fair share of alcohol, so the entire night wasn't a complete waste. \n\nWhen the bill came out, I was shocked to see that not even one of my desserts had been taken off the bill (geeze it was my birthday!!!).  Which in my opinion is pretty lame considering how much money we had spent. \n\nSo hopefully some of you who read this will decide not to waste your time and money on n9ne!!!!!!!!!!"

            "review": "This may come as a surprise, but I am a mere mortal. Being a mortal (even if just barely), I do have my weaknesses. One such weakness would be a well prepared steak. I have set upon a mission to slowly but surely try all of the amazing steakhouses this town has to offer. My next box to check off was the absurdly spelled, but well reviewed, N9NE Steakhouse at the Palms. If you don't enjoy reading, I'll give you the conclusion off the bat. This place is pretty bomb! It's definitely worth checking out. However, as is the case with a lot of good steakhouses, it isn't cheap. But it's well worth it. \n\nI started with the Fried Chicken Won Tons. They are pretty awesome. You get like 6 or 7 crispy Won Tons on a long plate over a little bit of blue cheese with a nice hot sauce on the side for dipping. It was a great starter. They also have like 3 kinds of bread, I tried the pretzel bread which was great, I also sampled a delicious soft foccacia bread. \n\nThen I ordered the massive, aged Bone-In Ribeye. It was cooked perfectly and was nice and juicy. For sides, I opted for the Mac and Cheese and the Gnocchi. My god, these sides did their absolute best to outshine that magnificent cut of meat. The Mac and Cheese was so rich and creamy. The cheese was a perfect blend of creamy, cheesy, richness. A nice complement to the rest of the meal. But honestly, as unexpected as it was, the Gnocchi stole the show. It is a potato gnocchi in the most incredible truffle cream sauce. Each tiny bite just melts in your mouth. Just thinking about it as I write this review a day later almost brings tears to my eyes. I have some left over in the fridge and I think I'm about to reheat it when I'm done here. It's side dishes like this that could make N9NE appeal to everyone, even those kooky vegetarians I've been reading about on the internet. Not sure if there are any Vegan dishes, but this place is friendly enough that they probably can accommodate.\n\nI saw the dessert menu and there seemed to be some amazing options. But I couldn't fit another bite of anything in my already stuffed, yet thoroughly satisfied stomach. This is a mission for next time.\n\nSo you know the food was outrageous, but how was the service at a place that seems like it could easily be a typical pretentious Vegas establishment, with a nice decor and celebrities coming in daily? It was actually phenomenal. The bartenders are super personable and talented. I'm bad with names but I believe it was Anna and Kerry. The manager Christian was also very friendly and accommodating. \n\nIn closing, this place checks off every aspect that I feel makes a great restaurant. If it was a little cheaper, I'd probably eat here every day. That's probably for the best though. I can't wait for my next visit, there's much more on the menu that I have to try. And obviously the Gnocchi Round 2."

If anything was lacking, I don't know what that would be.\n \nThe dinner was perfect from appetizers to entrees with enough food that the dessert wasn't necessary. I am not a chef and no, I don't eat at all the great places but I do enjoy and evening out now and then that doesn't include golden arches. This was universes away from that. \n\nThe waiter, Andrew,  and the server were both kind and neither made us feel out of place which can  and does happen at some places. Well done Andrew-I  hope you go far!\n\nThe food was great! My medium rare tenderloin was just that and my hubbys' medium tenderloin was done to perfection. The lobster mashed potatoes were something you'd like to eat every day if only there weren't doctors. \n\n The service was on par with enough time for eating and enjoying before the next course was brought out. Never felt rushed even though later in the meal the place was stating to get busier.\n\nAs a local I can say I would pick this place again. There may be other steakhouses in town with celebrity chefs and perhaps they are better. I wouldn't know, haven't been to them. I'm not even sure if I would have the palate education to make a comparison  of the best. I just know I liked this and hubby and I agreed while we couldn't do this every weekend, we may do this more in the future as the prices were within reason for the great food we received, and the excellent service."

I couldn't expect it to be any better! =)\n\nRoasted Mushroom & Onions (Side): Delicious as they should be! And all the sides were BIG servings.

My love for truffle is unexplainable so the fries were amazing to me and the cream of spinach was also very tasty! \n\nWaiter also gave me a fun birthday dessert which consisted of graham crackers drizzled with dark chocolate, white chocolate and Nutella, marshmallows, and a  clay stove thing where I can roast my marshmallows to my liking! \nI was VERY full but couldn't help but have a couple s'mores!\n\nOverall good experience!"

We got a nice booth in the back of the place, which gave us a nice spot to people watch.  The NBA summer league was going on, so several unidentifiable ballers were in attendance.  After a quick and strong cocktail at the bar, our hostess who we dubbed \"sade\" (who was actually quite helpful) showed us to our booth.  To start we had a shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque.  The shrimp were nice, but it would be nice to get more than 3 . Bisque was excellent (i get it everywhere that serves it) rich, creamy with a nice cognac finish.  I had an 18 oz  bone in ny that was fantastic.  My wife had a bone in fillet that was quite good as well.  For sides we had lobster mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus as sides.  As for the potatoes, they are amazing, topped with what looked like the same lobster bisque , which was fine with me. Asparagus have a great lemony zing.  All in all great food and service.  Just like any good restaurant in vegas, you could spend hundreds on dinner, especially if you take the waiters wine recommendation. They play rock music at a pretty loudly in here, which was ok with me.  But don't expect to have a quiet conversation in here.  If you are in Vegas, and you like upscale steak places with one page menus (like i do) check it out."

It was definitely worth the wait.  \n\nThe General Manager, Jesse, is the cousin of one of my oldest and best friends, so he brought out two complimentary glasses of champagne to start off our meal right.  Was a nice touch that we appreciated.  \n\nI've been lucky enough to try some of the best steakhouses in the country, and with all due respect to BoBo's in SF and Del Frisco's in NY, I can fairly say that the 16 oz. bone-filet I had at N9NE was the best steak I've ever had.  The steak was a perfectly cooked medium and I savored every single bite.  We paired our steaks with a Stags Leap Cabernet.  I highly recommend it. My girlfriend and I shared a delicious shrimp cocktail to start, and we went with side dishes of creamed spinach and jalapeno cheddar potatoes (which was probably the best potato side dish I've ever had).  Two bests in one dinner? Well, that's what I call a legendary evening.  \n\nAs for the atmosphere, it's unlike any other steakhouse I've been to.  Much more of a \"club\" feel than the classic steakhouse, but it's consistent with the Palms.  It was also fun to people watch while we ate.  Afterall, it was a Friday night in Vegas, so everyone was dressed to impress.\n\nN9NE is now my personal bench mark for the best steak in the country. Can't wait to go back."

A little heavy on the salt, but I've actually never tasted a lobster bisque salted to my liking.  Flavor was very rich and creamy, yet light at the same time.  The cognac was a nice touch.\n\nSteak: They claim the aged steaks are the most popular item on the menu, but is it good?  We decided to try it.  I split a porterhouse 22 ouncer with my girlfriend.  I ordered medium but received medium well. My friend (we came with another couple) also ordered a porterhouse and it came out well done when he ordered medium rare.  If we're going to pay 50 dollars for a steak dinner they better get it right!  So we ask our server to recook our steaks.  She checks the meat with a flashlight and agrees that it was overcooked.  While we were waiting, they brought out two shrimp cocktails for us on the house.  That certainly made us very happy.  It made us glad that they actually screwed up our steaks haha.   When they finally remade our steaks, we dug in.  It was cooked pretty accurately this time, but I just came to the conclusion that the steak wasn't very good.  I've had MUCH better for half the price.  The meat was stringy and it seemed the juice wasn't being retained in the steak.  The sauce that they used wasn't great, I believe it was a wine reduction sauce.  Overly salty and flavorless.  Have my taste buds become spoiled?  \n\nSide #1 Lobster mashed potatoes:  This mashed potatoes were pretty decent.  I'd prefer it a little less \"mashed\" if that makes sense to you guys.  It was a little watery for me.  However, they must have been very generous to stick all that lobster in there.  I mean, the chunks were huge and plentiful.\n\nSide #2 Creamed spinach: This dish was average.  It's like any other creamed spinach at a standard steakhouse.\n\nI probably woudn't return to this place to eat, wouldn't mind coming here for a drink though.  The environment is very club-like, everything is dimly lit in a soft blue color.  Although it's dim, its bright enough to read items off the menu.  \n\n3 stars for the service and environment, 1 star for the lobster bisque, -1 star for the overpriced steak."

I have absolutely no problem spending $50 on a good steak but N9NE was simply not a $200 per couple dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance was not that of a high end steakhouse.  It is as if you are in a nightclub with loud top 40 music playing and mirrored pillars.  There's a way to blend trendy and classy (I enjoy it when it works), however this was well over the top.   This was trendy cheesey.  Example - The drunk patrons at the next table to our left kept \"singing\"  (or better yet screaming and grunting) along to the music as if it was karaoke.  The couple making out at another table next to ours completed the experience - did they order any food or were they just dining on each other's faces all night?\n\nOur server was beyond pretentious and pompous during his chore of waiting on us.  And honestly, there was no reason to be.  I almost pulled him over at one point to tell him to cut the act, I've dined at restaurants with much more class than this one and the service does not need to be this way.  Of course I held back hoping that the food would make up for the atmosphere and service.  \n\nWhile the food was okay, I wouldn't say it blew me away by any means.  Everyone's' steaks were good but the oysters on the half shell were tiny and the lobster on the surf and turf was decidedly bad.\n\nAt the end of the meal I was disappointed that I had wasted my time and money there....there are so many other restaurants in Vegas I would love to try.  I guess if you're staying at the Palms it might be a good choice (although I've heard Alize is good), but to make a trip out from the strip was pointless."

He also made my favorite, a Pomegranite Mojito.  \n\nThe bread was amazing.  There was a hard bread, a soft sundried-tomato bread and a muffin that tasted like a croissant.  the chef created a special ceviche for us with swordfish.  It was amazing.  \n\nI ordered the lobster bisque and I would have to say it was life-changing.  I shared the Ribeye for two dinner with another friend at he table.  This this was huge and could have fed four to six people easily.  It just melted in my mouth.  I tried the lobster, which was perfect.  The garlic mashed potatoes were rich and amazing.    \n\nDefintely worth going to if you enjoy a high end resturant."

Went to Alize years ago (forgot the name) and accidentally booked here with no regrets.  \n\nFor appetizers don't skip out on the Lobster Wontons. (5 pcs)  WOW!  Delicious just by itself & I would highly recommend and order it again.  We got chopsticks along with the wontons in an American restaurant, it makes sense... Asian appetizer so we get Asian utensils, lol.  We also ordered the prime rib ravioli which was good, but probably a one-time thing for me. (4 pcs)    We came for regular dining but it looks like you get a good deal during Happy Hour for both of these dishes. :)\n\nSplit an 18 oz. rib eye between two and asked for medium rare.  It was cooked perfectly & so so good!  Came on a Saturday night and it was a bit busy & loud for \"fine dining\" but overall a good experience.  I'm sure it's much more quiet, intimate, & a less social setting on weekday nights for a special evening out.  \n\nFor dessert, if you're a chocolate lover like me, I recommend the brooklyn chocolate black out cake.  Really rich & decadent to finish off your meal."

We went before the current remodel, so it may have changed but it seemed like it was trying a little too hard to be modern and hip. I'm hoping they changed that.\n\nOne of the really great things about N9ne is the super affordable prix fixe menu. It is $59.00 per person with unlimited wine pairing. While the food was good, I wasn't blown away like I was expecting to be. The steak was a little overcooked, but still had good flavor.\n\nThe selling point for N9ne is the outstanding customer service. Our server was amazing and never let our glasses get empty.\n\nOverall, I had an excellent experience. I would definitely go back."

The three of us decided to eat Oysters on the Half Shell, Ahi Tuna Tartare and the Porcini Risotto. Pleased by the menu and our selections of food, however there is no WOW factor. We all agreed that none of these were better than anything we could have had in any other restaurant. The saving grace was my wine that made me smile and my friend enjoyed her glass. I didn't want a white wine as I was in the mood for red. With the food choices I needed something light with flavor yet not overpowering. Pinot Noir was my selection by Cold Light.  The wine was very smooth and light with hints of chocolate and oak. Dinner ended pleasantly as we were all very ready for the next spot to enjoy dessert. \n\nFIND PICTURES ON http://jenn-uncorked.com"

This was out one really nice meal for the trip so we splurged a little. Received comp champagne toast,chicken wing app and shot. The chicken wing was tiny but flavorful. For apps the table got mushroom risotto, crab cake and oysters. Risotto was amazing, very rich and savory. Crabcake was good but I was expecting the best I ever had, which it was a distant second. I have to say for entrees I had to take about 10 minutes to digest the prices. Once I realized it was only money we decided on the 28 ounce prime rib and 12 ounce filet. You must think about 28 ounces...and when it comes to the table it is twice what you imagined. Steaks were cooked to perfection, the entire table savored every bite. Creamed spinach was probably the least favorite thing on the table, and the lobster mashed potatoes were just ok at best. Overall it was a great dining experience. As for the food justifying the price, not so much. Table of six the bill was $600+. I have had equally good meals for half the price so is it worth $100 per person, maybe once but not again."

High vaulted ceiling - almost a silver color.  Two columns covered in those little square mirrors, like on a disco ball.  Round bar in the middle of the dining room, and another bar on the side near the entrance.\n\nTo start, I had the lobster bisque.  One of my all time favorite soups.  This one was served with a lump of lobster meat in the middle of the bowl - and then the bisque poured over it at the table.  Cool presentation, but at first, I thought the lobster was some kind of rice-cake and that it had come to the wrong table.  No, no, no... it was chunks of lobster meat that eventually was swimming in creamy soup.  So rich.  So divine.  I've had many a lobster bisque since I was little, and this definitely ranks as one of the top on my list.\n\nFor dinner, I had the 8oz filet mignon with Bearnaise sauce.  It was cooked absolutely perfectly with a pepper crust.  My husband had the bone in rib-eye steak, and our friends shared a 40oz rib-eye for two.   I've never seen so much steak on one table before!\n\nFor the sides, no question we had the mac and cheese (just serve me up a whole bowl of that and I'll be happy), creamed corn (the table favorite), and their version of potatoes au gratin - they call it Julie's hot potatoes (not so much a favorite).  If anything, get the mac and cheese, and definitely the sweet corn.  All the sides had left overs even though shared by four people.\n\nToo full for dessert.  Absolutely worth the trip off the main strip."

The Prime Rib was delicious (among the best I've had), Kobe burgers very tasty, the seafood was just average, All entrees were a la carte, a side dish of vegetables or potato were an additional $14 (come on, on top of a $50 steak). However, it was the service and atmosphere that was most disappointing. Paying this much for a meal should include extremely attentive service, which we did not receive, and an atmosphere that does NOT include loud ACDC music. We could not hold a decent conversation at our table, and ACDC does not seem like the most fitting background music for a fine dining experience.  Lastly, the restrooms are staffed with attendants that stand there while you do your business, squirt soap in your hand when you wash your hands and hand you a towel to dry. Of course, they expect a tip on the way out and all I wanted was a quiet restroom experience, not company that wants money when I'm done. I've been to many fine dining establishments and this one needs a little work. I will not be dining here again."

Nostalgia aside and being purely objective, I would prefer to get a Sizzler steak over anything from N9NE.  \n\nWhile N9NE brings back memories of Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell, the Night at the Roxbury theme is a little too tacky of an ambiance for me.  Strike one.  The hostesses were both hilarious and dancing as we walked in, but our server on the other hand was a total nut case.   Just an awkward odd ball that would interrupt at the oddest times.  Anyway, the service was mediocre and this one star has nothing to do with the service or the ambiance, but is purely a rating of the food. \n\nWhat we ordered:  Sashimi, 18oz. NY Sirloin 50 day dry-aged, 10oz Flat Iron Steak, and 22oz Bone-in Ribeye.  Honestly, everything was really bad.  The sashimi wasn't fresh and the portions were ultra thin.  I'm sure they have decent quality meat, but the problem was with the way it was cooked and the marinade.  All were cooked to about medium-well when we all asked for medium rare+.  The marinade had a terrible mouthfeel, none that would make the famous What is Love duo break out into song and dance.  \n\nTo cap it off when we told our server that we didn't like the food, his response was \"sorry brah, can't get it right with everyone\" ... really haha it was so ridiculous it was hilarious.

Since we needed to get back to the strip proper for a show, we booked dinner for 7 PM. The dining room was fairly empty for a Saturday night post New Year's when we showed up, but by the time we finished eating it had filled up nicely. As with the rest of the Palms, N9NE presents a hipster image. The dining room features lots of white, chrome, and purple light. The speakers blared AC/DC and The Killers at volumes loud enough to make a conversation between two people difficult.\n\nDrinks and bread arrived quickly. We skipped appetizers as they are almost all seafood/shellfish based (allergies), and instead split a generous Caesar salad. I wished there were some larger slivers of parm and a less creamy dressing, but it was still good. For my entree I had a filet. I ordered it blue, but what arrived was more what I'd consider rare. There was some kicky seasoning on the meat, and it was served in jus with a sprig of rosemary that scented it nicely. For a side we split the steak fries, which were nicely crispy and greaseless. The servers and dining room support staff worked swiftly and unobtrusively. We skipped desserts (needed to save room for more drinks), but they looked fun... a table near us was toasting their own S'mores on a tabletop grill (but not well, unfortunately, and we were prompted to leave not just by our other commitment but also by the icky smell of scorched marshmallow and chocolate). \n\nSo, this was good, but I don't feel the need to go there again. The cut and cooking of the meat did not compare to my Vegas favorite Craftsteak, and truthfully the filet I had at the Ann Arbor Chop House the week before was of better quality and texture."

N9ne was almost just as expensive, with $60-$80 steaks, $22 sides, and $16 drinks, but not nearly as exquisite and with piss poor service. \n\nNow the positives... The short rib ravioli appetizer  may have been one of the most delicious things both my wife and I have ever tasted. The dough was cooked perfectly, the sauce was to die for, and the shaved black truffle on top pulled everything together perfectly. It was sad there was only 4 ravioli. And for $18.  The organic roasted half chicken was probably the best chicken I've ever had. So moist, juicy, tender, with a delicious Rosemary lemon butter sauce. Ate every last bite. The filet tartare was phenomenal. The lobster mac n cheese was very tasty. (But to charge $22 for a SMALL little bowl of, I would say, a maximum of literally 15 noodles and MAYBE 5 tiny pieces of lobster? Really? Disappointing.) And my wife's pear cocktail was honestly amazing. I'm not normally a cocktail guy, but it was really tasty. Even at $16/drink, she got 2. \n\nAll in all, great food. (Still wouldn't call it comparable to Gordon Ramsay's Steak). But for these prices, I expect to be catered to. And the service we got... definitely lacking."

            "review": "Eating here reminds me of the $6000 burger from Carl's Jr: A Six-dollar burger and fries served up with a bottle of 1982 Chateau Petrus.  N9ne had a similar strange dichotomy of hoity-toityness immersed in hip-hop.  Such is Vegas.\n\nUpon entry, we checked in with the hostesses, yes three of them, a blond, a brunette, and a brown-haired girl.  This is how gastronomic porn starts, I guess.  I kept staring at the ceiling which looked like icey cement.  A weird array of hip hop music was bumpin throughout the place which made me scratch my head a few times.  Weird for a fine dining establishment.  The main bar was the centerpiece of the dining area, which I had no quams about.  Staff were all trendy/sheik and helpful.  Five of us dudes agreed to share two 40oz rib eyes from the special menu and a couple of sides.  I picked a glass of the featured red varietal to make it look like I knew what's up.\n\nThe bread assortment was pretty cool, a couple standards were served, plus soft pretzel sticks with mustard just to kick you in the shins.  My wine was excellent.  I know little about the stuff but I know what I like when I taste it.  It was brilliantly complex with a bit of syrah spiciness.  The (porn) stars of the night arrived - a couple sexy platters of sliced rib eye, 80 ounces to be exact.  One medium rare and the other medium for the blood-fearing.  The crust of the meat was seasoned and seared nicely.  The accompanying gravy was deceptively good; as I nearly overlooked its rich with subtle sweet and bitter tones, which paired nicely with the meat.  The wine paired beautifully with the meat and the sauce, forming a sinful threesome in my mouth.  I loved the meat so much, I gnawed at the meat off of the slice with the bone, bad idea.  That almost took my rating down a star as it was super salty, but you're lucky, I like salt.\n\nOur cholesterol and blood pressure were probably through the roof but we felt like men leaving the place. *grunts*"

She was amazing, she really hooked it up! \n\nWe decided to start out with Moscow Mules. Best moscow mules ever! They bring out a copper cup with vodka and the ginger beer bottle and pour it in front of you. Oh how I love ginger beer! Sandy also brought us out some toasting champagne. Cheers to another 5 years!\n\nCesar salad came out with some bread. The bread was so good. It was different kinds. I picked up one that had onions inside the bread oh that was really good! Only thing I didn't like about the salad was it had big chunks of bacon. Like really BIG fatty bacon! \n\nAnother round of moscow mules and champagne...\n\nMy eyes watered when our food came out. I got the Surf and Turf -- 8oz filet mignon, Maine lobster on top with white truffle aioli and it laid on some Bomb mashed potatoes. Or I think it was mashed potatoes! The meat was cooked with absolute perfection. The lobster was not minimal but a lot and paired well with the aioli sauce. My mouth waters as I write this review. The beau got the 18oz bone in ribeye that had been dry aged for 35 days! It was ginormous! I don't know how he finished that thing! We also got the Lobster Mashed Potatoes as our side. Yes I know.. Lobster again!! Yes lobster again! I love lobster. Best decision yet! Because that dish was so fantastically delicious! Again, there was loads of lobster. Next time I'm gonna get the Lobster Mac N Cheese! \n\nWe were absolutely full. But Sandy brought us out some dessert! Smores! They brought out a small fire stove device, crackers with dark & white chocolate, marshmallows and sticks! we had a mini campfire at our table. Stay with caution though because I almost burned the restaurant down twice. I'm exaggerating! \n\nOverall, a great anniversary dinner. Thank you N9NE, thank you Sandy, thank you Carl I., and Thank you to my beloved beau for the amazing night! \n\nCan't wait to come back!"

Although we were seated in a private room, and we had a frat house version of us nine girls across from us and then 2 quieter parties adjacent and to the right of us. It was interesting. :) \n\nThe bill for 9 girls was a little over $1200- 1300 -- I can't really remember, but it was somewhere in that range. We all got cocktails *$15/ each + $200 bottle of wine, so if you can imagine a lot of the bill was towards beverages. I in fact spent more on beverages than my own food. I had the encrusted salmon over cabbage (replaced with string beans), but everyone else's dishes were far superior. We had everything from oysters on the half shell to caviar to lobster to king crab legs to lamb to chicken to lobster to rib eye to filet mignon to kobe carpacchio & kobe tartar to lobster mashed potatoes and lobster bisque to the yummyness that is all food served at N9NE.. you name it, it was at our table. It was all pretty tasty... \n\nAll in all the wait staff was great and friendly. The only issue my party had was with the hostess at the start of the night, but I wasn't there to witness it. :)\n\nMain dishes range from $28- $7X? Caviar ranges from $125- $500 I think... and all cocktails are $15. Wine list depends... and so forth, you get the point :)"

This is coming to you from someone who does not like salads. I would almost go so far as to say I generally *hate* salads. But I make exception for this one.\n\nMy favorite side is the Truffle Cream Gnocchi. It's one of those sides that you wish would never end, but if it has to, it's with a whopping lick of the plate. Other great sides: Skinny Fries, Creamed Corn, Lobster Mashed Potatoes.\n\nThe shellfish is excellent too - very fresh. We had a sample on ice, including oysters, crab legs and lobster claws.

I made reservations 6 months ago and I was looking forward to eating here for a very long time.  We were not disappointed.  This is truly an outstanding and beautiful restaurant and I would highly recommend it.  \n\nWe started off with cocktails and between all of us, we tried most of the signature cocktails.  I had the sangria, which was very potent, and the ciroctail, which was very tasty.  Once we moved to our table, the service continued to be excellent and very attentive.  We had 4 appetizers- lobster potstickers, avocado fries, oysters rockerfeller and calamari.  All were great, but most of us especially enjoyed the avocado fries and the potstickers.  The gratis hummus and chips were not really memorable, but everyone really liked the bread, which I did not have.\n\nHubby had a caesar salad and someone else had the wedge salad, which they liked.  Entrees included the sea scallops, surf and turf, organic fire roasted chicken, bone-in ribeye and the filet.  Everyone raved about their food. Sides included the green beans, creamed spinach, lobster mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and hot potatoes.  Again, everything was excellent, especially the lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nSo after 25 cocktails, 4 apps, 10 entrees and 5 sides, we were given gratis carrot cake mini cupcakes, which were the perfect end to the meal.  All together, it was $1100 well spent because how often in life do you eat that well and receive such amazing service?  The manager also gave us free passes to Ghostbar and Moon, so we ended up hanging out after dinner and everyone had a great time.  I would highly recommend this restaurant as it was one of the highlights of our trip."

The service is spectacular, from the head waiter to the gentleman with the bread, everyone goes out of their way to make sure you are having a great experience. My party had a pretty large sampling of the menu so I feel very comfortable saying everything on it is outstanding. The seafood was all very fresh and the steaks were flavorful and perfectly cooked. I'm not usually a fan of the Palms since their tables tend to dominate my wallet, but N9NE Steakhouse will keep me coming back. Another nice touch was our waiter walking us up to Ghostbar after our meal and getting us in without cover and/or waiting in line.

I guess the cool dim \"South Beach\" fluorescent lighting is so that all the Hunks and the Babes can look hot.\n\nOn a positive note, I gave 2 stars for the service which I actually thought was great! The waiter was very helpful and enthusiastic (must of been the 18% tip on a $600 bill) my Arnold Palmer was always full when I reached for it."

I take a lot of points off for the music. It was very loud and they were playing very current hip hop and other music. At one point a group of girls started singing to the song that came on. That is not what I want to be listening to when eating a 700$ meal with my friends. I am not looking for chamber music, but not being able to hear everyone at a table of 5 was a distraction and an annoyance."

After seeing N9ne on our way to our room we decided to review it on a Yelp and decided to give it a try.  We were able to get reservations and were seated right away when we checked in.  Everything is very trendy, good music and over all a great first impression.  There were three of us, my husband, my son and myself.  We didn't order appetizers because we didn't want to ruin our steak appetite.  After we placed our order a wonderful bread basket arrived along with a Cesar salad on the house.  It was a great salad that I would order, very delicious.  As for our food order, my son ordered the porterhouse and said it was fantastic.  Cooked how he ordered so he loved, loved it.  My hubby & I ordered the special which was steak with two huge grilled prawns.  I don't remember what cut of steak but it was cooked perfect and was delicious.  The prawns were wonderful.  We did order the truffle fries and they were super yumm and more than enough for the three of us to share.  It is a great steak house and is priced to match the great food and great service.  My only regret is that I didn't order a great glass of wine.  Next time!  I know N9ne will be on our list every time we are in town."

I'm just completely stumped at how anyone can make such heavenly surf and turf. \n\nThe surf and turf is a Maine lobster and 8oz filet mignon sauteed in red wine and a white truffle aioli dish. And it's just the perfect combination! My lobster was just absolutely succulent, sweet, and most importantly fresh! It's quite possibly one of the best surf and turfs I've ever had. Nothing can compare to the filet mignon either. I'm always skeptical of ordering filet mignon as it can lack flavor. Which is why I'm so amazed at how much flavor my filet mignon retained! My boyfriend ordered the 40oz ribeye (for two). It is quite possibly the most flavorful and tender ribeye I have ever eaten. Yes, ever! And according to their menu, it is one of the two options under \"Best of N9NE\". I can definitely say with confidence that ordering any type of meat here will be delicious, tender, and flavorful.\n\nAlso, please make it a priority to order medium rare. If you don't like your meats that rare, well, you can't really enjoy a good steak then. Shut up and just eat the steak!\n\nI did have an issue with what came afterwards. I understand that salt is a key ingredient in making any steak shine like gold, but they might have over seasoned my steak with the salt. I was dying of thirst afterwards. I downed over a liter of water an hour later.\n\nOh, but I can just gush about this place like my lover! But I'll leave it at that. This is place is a must if you're in Vegas and ready to spend big bucks! And I mean big because a meal for 7 people can run upward to $1000 with alcohol and appetizers included."

I've been here numerous times and I've never had a single negative thing to say about this place.\n\nFor me N9NE comes across as a mix of old and new Vegas - not that I ever experienced old Vegas first-hand.  It's classy-chic ambiance is decidedly modern, while the servers are dressed in a more retro, classic style.  I find it to be a bit of a welcome juxtaposition.  \n\nMy dining experiences have generally been at peak times when it is definitely crowded and noisy -- as it should be.  This is a place to see and be seen, all of the noise and commotion help bring it to life.\n\nThe service has always been fantastic.  I almost have a sense of privilege whenever I am interacting with a server, barista, or host here.  Some servers have stood out in my mind more than others, but that can be said of most places.\n\nThe food is absolutely delicious and by far my favorite part of the N9NE experience.  Their Surf-and-Turf is simply unrivaled.  I have witnessed people who do not like lobster in awe after their first bite of the lobster, trying to control themselves as to not devour the whole thing immediately!  The Bone-in Ribeye is also fantastic.  But, then again, everything is fantastic.\n\nI remember well and fondly all of my meals at N9NE.  For me it stands out as a first-rate dining experience.

There were six of us, and we sat down with a high sense of optimism due to a successful meeting, and we all had expectations of a fine dinner. The bill was near $600 (without a bottle of CDP). We could have had a far better experience elsewhere at half that cost.\n\nVENUE\nN9NE is in the Palms Hotel, on the west side of the freeway. It's an ugly restaurant that reflects all that makes Las Vegas gaudy. It's noisy, with low-fi but LOUD music selected by a maniac, and there was no way to get it turned down though our party of six comprised half the customers. As a supposedly high-end restaurant, wouldn't you expect tablecloths? Proper silverware for the various dishes and salads? Cleanliness? All were lacking...\n\nFOOD\nGood bread, nice appetizers, excellent salads, ok steaks. However, I judge steaks by a Deuce at Peter Luger (or Wolfgang's) in NYC. I ordered a $59 sirloin, and tasted my wife's Barry's (end of a prime rib), and certainly would not rate either as above average restaurant fare. Mine was ordered 'medium rare', but the kitchen delivered a steak that was more 'medium well'.  My $12 baked potato was obviously prepared a day before, and heated for me. I am an omnivore, and was among business associates, so did not send back my food. By the end of the meal we decided NOT to try any of the $12-15 desserts.\n\nSERVICE\nHow do I hate thee? Let me count the ways. Miserable. Lacking. Ignorant. Poorly trained. N9NE presents itself as a superior steakhouse, and the prices suggest an excellent dining experience managed by competent waitstaff supervised and trained by experts. Absolutely not! \n\nCONCLUSION\nN9NE is a pretentious restaurant with overpriced food served by incompetent staff."

I took Restaurant Week to give it a try.  \n\nThe bread basket was brought first and it had some good choices. Two pretzel rolls, two jalape\u00f1o, cheese rolls, and a corn bread mini muffin.  Along with this was served some butter triangles with coarse salt on top.  There was also a container of spicy sauce for the rolls, too, that was very good.\n\n The first course was a choice of soups/salads.  I opted for the Caesar salad with a cup of lobster bisque soup.  The salad was standard.  The lobster bisque was very good.  Many chunks of lobster of good size.  \n\nFor the second course, I ordered the Delmonico ribeye, a 10 ounce steak with a red wine sauce.  I ordered the steak blue.  The server confirmed that the steak would be cool inside and I agreed.  It was brought cooked a little more than blue but it was still rare and was quite good.  Along with the steak, two sides were served--a plate of asparagus spears and a container of cheddar mashed potatoes.  The steak was tender, juicy, and cooked almost perfectly.  The sides were good and generous.\n\nFor dessert, there was no choice.  It's flourless chocolate cake served with blood orange sorbet.  The cake was OK.  It was dry.  The blood orange sorbet was really good.  It made your mouth pucker.\n\nService was very good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking.  Even though the restaurant was not very full, sound reverberated around the room a lot and it seemed loud despite the few customers.\n\nI enjoyed my dfinner a lot and this would be a place to come back to in the future."

It is a late crowd that comes here before heading off to The Playboy Club or a night of gambling. The places appears to cater to the younger, hip, Hollywood trash set. It is not surprising to see a young star or starlet come traipsing in with his/her entourage. But, back to the food... \n\nI have dined here a half dozen times and the food has been excellent. The place is a little noisy, but that seems to be the LV trend these days. The most recent visit started with the big seafood appetiser platter. There were big-ass shrimp, crab, lobster, escargot, and oysters. Pr icy, but succulent. I went for the small filet--medium rare as the entire. It came out that way and was just excellent. Cream corn, grilled asparagus, and mac and cheese were the sides picked by the table and were very yummy. The mac and cheese is the best I have had anywhere. \n\nAnd to see if the bar was up to my standard--do they have a blender--the answer was just like I found at the SW steakhouse at Wynn.

Spinach creamed was so-so, and the roasted vegetables are a waste of a side, tasteless and only good for those who are watching their weight, I suppose.\n\nNo desserts tried... just too full from the steak!\n\nThe drinks went from the $69 special margaritas looked amazing, but we settled on a bottle of wine and individual cocktails (all pretty good and strong).\n\nOverall a good experience, although tough if you're not a fan of steak.. the rest of the menu is a little bit limited to some seafood.\n\nWhile not the best atmosphere for a steakhouse, it is definitely something catered to the style of people going out after to have some fun at Moon or the Playboy Club with the fluorescent accent lights changing like Pod in Philadelphia, and music from the club.\n\nRecommend reservations, though. \n\nAfter a big dinner, they can get you passes to the clubs at Palms, too."

I give it 4 stars because it's located in the Palms which, maybe it was just the weekend I went, does not have the same appeal it used to. The restaurant was not very crowded and the casino outside was basically empty. So while the food was fantastic, the trip over to the Palms seemed like a waste. I probably wouldn't take the cab ride over there again."

High energy, loud, for the young and young at heart.  Quality steaks but, \"not your daddy's steakhouse\".    \n\nThe new menu sees the addition of dry aged beef,  contemporary cuts and steakhouse staples such as a  beautiful braised short rib and a classic 3lb lobster thermidor.\n\nStarters fail to impress.  Secondary to conversation or an after thought kickin it with your buds, the flavors are correct, the presentation OK, no WOW factor.  The fried rock shrimp OK.  Perfectly cooked but the accompanying lemon aioli increases the oily mouth feel.  The lobster pot stickers with bok choy, shitake mushrooms and a chile ginger soy sauce, not memorable.  The king crab and gruyere stuffed shrooms, a tasty bite but the cheese masks the sweetness of the crab.\n\nThe steaks.  All USDA prime, wet aged (except he 35 and 50 day dry aged rib eyes), very well trimmed.  Excellent sear.  Even cooking.  Accurate temp.  Standard cuts are, well standard.  Great bone in fillet and porterhouse.  The 35 day dry aged rib steak is tender, and pleasantly nutty with hints of cheesy aroma and a wafting umame finish.  The 50 day, meltingly tender with a pronounced bleu cheese aroma.  Some funkiness at the edges, not for everyone.  The standout, \"Barry's Steak\".  A simple grilled rib cap.  Tender, packed with flavor.  Served with complementing cipollini onions and shishito peppers.\n\nFor entrees, the \"Kobe\" short rib is excellent.  Not true Kobe beef but, perfectly braised, not stringy, finished with a horseradish crust served with curried root veg and a Cabernet sauce, the earthy flavors marry well.  The lobster thermidor, a classic in every respect.  At three pounds, massive, with firm but still juicy meat enveloped in cream and cheese.  Simply put, good eats.\n\nFor sides, the creamed corn, adds a great sweetness to any steak.  The broccoli and cauliflower gratin with a cheddar cheese sauce complements the dry aged steaks umame finish.  The highly touted lobster mashed potato is good but far to rich as a side dish to steaks.  It steals the show.\n\nVery good service.  Steakhouse proper despite the cool vibe of the place.  Very good wine list.  Vegas resort prices.\n\nA steakhouse that understands what not having \"Las Vegas Blvd\" in its address means.  Translated:  it's less expensive, omits baller ingredients but manages to keep the vibe of the Palms."

When we closed out waiter did not take any accountability to split the check, told me to spit the checks (between 7 people) when I asked for the manager, he backed his waiter vs. taking a customer service approach and listening to me and understanding. Instead he elected to explain in Vegas that is the standard protocol and that is how it is. I've eaten at several 4 and 5 start restaurants and by far, the most disappointing in customer service and management. I would not recommend this business due to management and their lack of customer service. The palms should be ashamed to have such a poor staff representing their facility. Go to del friscos or Ruth's Chris' where they value their customer and go out of their way to accommodate their customers paying $60+ for good food and service."

Spacious.  \nOrdered:  Chilled Asparagus Salad, Lobster Bisque, Ribeye (done medium) for two, Twice-baked Potato with Black Truffle, Roasted Mushrooms with Caramelized Onions, and Creamed Spinach. \"Complimentary Mini Chicken Empanadas\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$190\n\nIt's not a Vegas trip unless we dine at a steakhouse so for this trip, we decided to venture over to N9NE steakhouse for a nice hearty meal.  I was pleasantly surprised by the trendy appeal of the restaurant. Nice dim purple lighting.  Silver furniture.  I liked.  The service was also pleasant.  The hostess seated us right away and our server - Nate greeted us immediately.\n\nMuch on the menu looked good.  We had to refrain from ordering with our stomach to prevent ordering too much.  I guess we didn't do that great of a job because we still had so much leftover.  The chilled asparagus salad was a great starter.  It was chilled asparagus atop prosciutto with fresh arugula, maytag bleu cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette.  The asparagus was nice, cold, and crisp.  It went well with the ever so savory prosciutto.  I was also impressed with the lobster bisque.  Just the right amount of richness and very generous in their lobster chunks.\n\nAs for our main entree, I was slightly disappointed.  The rib-eye arrived all slice up (similar to Peter Lugar).  Because it was already sliced for us, it seemed to dry up a lot quicker.  By the time I got to my third slice, the meat was not very moist.  I expect a $90 steak to stay piping hot and moist.  Unfortunately this wasn't the case.  Flavor was OK.  It was served with an extremely strong wine-sauce.  One thing is for sure - it was a big piece of meat; enough to feed three!  In retrospect, I probably would have preferred to order my own, smaller steak.  The sides were all excellent.  Twice baked potato served with huge petal sized black truffle.  Made it extra rich!  Definite must have.  Mushrooms were very flavorful.  Recommend passing on the creamed spinach.  Not quite what I was expecting.  A bit on the watery side with an overage of cheese.\n\nIt was a good experience but I was expecting a bit more.  Doesn't quite make it on my list of must-return Vegas restaurants although I'm glad I can check it off. :)"

But we didn't get menus or bread until everyone arrived though. But at least we had our drinks.\n\nNice ambiance. Great server. Great food.\n\nFood Breakdown:\n\nBread: 3 types, a muffin kinda thing which was my favorite! slightly sweet and slighty salty and very soft. pretzel roll. and focaccia bread. comes with butter and horseradish type dip.\n\nAppetizers - Rock Shrimp (tricky tricky... it looks like a big popcorn kinda container full, but its only about 1/3 full, but quite yummy), calamari (delicious! best app we got) and ahi tuna tar tar (yummy). 3 appetizers, plus the bread, was a decent portion for the table.\n\nMain Course: I had the rack of lamb (comes with 4 AMAZING pieces of chop, and the best entree IMO and most of the party thought so too. very rich and flavorful), Filet Mignon bone-in with lobster surf... (if only the lobster was bigger!! but good size of filet and cooked a bit more rare than we ordered, but I loved it! Melts in your mouth delicious.) Kobe Burger (very pretty stack of fries included. an amazing burger, but still.. just a burger.) Porterhouse (HUGE and cooked more to the rare side), Scallops (pretty good and decent portion) - some orders were duplicated\n\nSides to share: Skinny fries (additive), mac&cheese (not that great), lobster mashed (I had really high expectations for this one and it didn't meet them, but it was good with lots of lobster chunks).\n\nDessert: specials were the Volcano Chocolate Cake and Chocolate Mousse. Both a disappointment. The chocolate mousse cake was kinda frozen in the center so it was kinda hard, not soft like mousse should be. The volcano cake was nothing special... just the molten cake. Banana split.. cute presentation, and just tasted okay. Wanted to try the smores cause it looked pretty, but we didn't :( In the pictures I saw a picture of like a dessert sampler, but they don't have that. Apparently it is only with preset menus and stuff. Bummer.\n\nOverall? Great place, good service, fabolous food and nice portions. Could be better... especially the desserts, but a fantastic meal. One of the best lamb I've had."

I recommend the 22 oz. bone-in ribeye for flavor, although my wife had the surf-and-turf and that was delicious as well.  The Paloma (with Ketel One) is a great drink, poured tableside.

We were worried that we wouldn't be able to make our show on time, so we talked to the girl at the front, she checked with the cook and voila, we were able to keep our 5:00 reservation!! Super bonus points for that because this place is very swanky! \n\nThe decor is simply divine: a waterfall on the entrance way, spacious room, lightly muted.

Definitely try to get her if you can. \n\nThe prix fix deal here is amazing, $65 for wine (red & white), main course, desserts, and more. We first started off with the Garbage Salad and Onion Soup. I thought I would never rave over salad and soup but I swear on my life, the best I've ever had! Next I had the halibut which was succulent and fresh.

With just one phone call and a call back from them about 10 minutes later a table for 6 opened up for us at the same time we reserved on Friday.  +1\n\nWe arrived promptly at 8:30 and were seated before our first round of cocktails were finished being prepared by the very beautiful and friendly bar tender.  +1\n\nThe first two things out of our waiters mouth were \"thank you Mr. Weber for choosing to dine with us tonight, apologizing for the reservation mixup (+1) and asking if there were any reservations we had that evening he should be aware of so we can ensure you are not rushed.\"  Love it!!!  +1\n\nDid I mention the decor was very cool and modern, it may have been a former nightclub from what it looked like with a large bar in the center of the seating area aside from the one near the entrance/waiting area.  Far from the \"livestock on the wall\" great steak places I've been to before.\n\nYes, the entree's are pricy and everything is a la carte, but that's to be expected for a high-end steak restaurant in Las Vegas.  Considering that, I felt the prices were on par.\n\nThere were 6 of us dining and we all had something different with a few appetizers.  A friend and I split the Sashimi appetizer which was fresh and well presented.  I had the 8oz filet with Lobster potatoes.  The steak was served hot and perfectly cooked.  The Lobster potatoes melted in my mouth and were a perfect accompaniment to the Filet.  I'll leave it to them to review their own meals but it was smiles all around.  Many of whom are from the mid-west and dine often at finer steak restaurants raking their meal in the top 5.\n\nThrough the meal our waiter was very attentive.  At one point a friend pointed out that his porterhouse was 2 levels overcooked.  Before the waiter returned with his complementary cocktail for the inconvenience a perfectly cooked replacement was in front of him!  Seriously less than 90 seconds, i was blown away.\n\nThrough the meal we were treated to complementary appetizer shots (forget what they were, but delicious and unexpected) along with a complementary tequila shot at the end of the meal.\n\nI maybe a bit biased being it was my best friends bachelor party, but this was easily one of the top 5 enjoyable meals in my life.\n\nAt the end of the evening the check came.  Not to be crass but i polled the group to get an idea of what they though the bill should be.  Outside of one person who nearly guessed it to the dollar, who then later changed it to $100 higher, everyone was easily $100 over.  To me that shows the great value this place delivered.  Looking forward to our next visit."

Upon checking in we also received a free short rib ravioli appetizer which was al dente & delicious. Our server Zack was friendly and accommodating. Our meal started with a salmon cake, compliments of the chef. We chose the Caesar salad & lobster bisque, followed by the Delmonico steak with asparagus & cheese mashed potato. The meal ended with a chocolate cake and blood orange sorbet. Dessert is usually my favorite thing about a meal, this was an odd pairing to me & fell a bit flat. The meal was paired with a Sauvignon Blanc & a merlot. Very generous pours! For $59 a person this is the absolute best deal in the restaurant and in the entire resort in my opinion. I do not know how long they will have this promotion, but take advantage of it while you can!!! I highly encourage N9NE to keep this promotion or one like it going!"

            "review": "I've now been here twice, and I have to say that I really like this place.  Located at the Palms hotel, it's a bit off the Strip, but an easy cab ride over.\n\nThe restaurant itself is set up very nicely.   It is nicely appointed, with a dim blue light cast over the whole dining area.  The dining tables surround a bar area, where you can also order food, I believe.  Supposedly the bar attract celebrities, but none were to be seen on this trip.  The place has a trendy, club-like feel to it.  Music is played over loudspeakers (where else but Vegas can you listen to Digital Underground while eating in a fine restaurant).  The place is LOUD, so don't go there expecting an ultra romantic evening.  It's more of a fun place to go with a bunch of friends or to take your date before heading out to the clubs or gambling.\n\nOn this particular visit, my dinner companion and I started off with the calamari and tuna appetizers.  I order calamari at almost every restaurant that serves it, and this particular app. was really good.  I thought it might have been a little oversalted, but nevertheless I enjoyed it.  The tuna was also really good.  Seared with spices on the outside, a beautiful red on the inside, and drizzled with a ginger/wasabi/soy sauce.  \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the 22 oz. Porterhouse and my date ordered a fig salad.  I tried some of her salad and I thought it was really good.  I don't know that I've ever had figs before (except for Fig Newtons, does that count?!) but I thought it worked well in the salad.  \n\nThe steak was fantastic.  I love the porterhouse because you get the meaty, flavorful NY strip on one side, and the buttery soft filet on the other.  It was grilled to medium rare perfection and the filet was so soft I probably could have cut it with my fork.  A really really good steak.\n\nThis was paired with their featured cabernet that I thought was awesome as well. \n\nI have tried their seared scallops before and they were incredible.\n\nOne of these days I'll hit it big at the tables and will try their 1.5 pound lobster for $165.  =-)"

Hubby had bone-in porter house, huge and melted in his mouth. \nDessert: They brought out their \"Campfire Dessert\" which is a pot on fire!!! (blue flame fire btw) with all the fixings for roasting your own smores, with a lovely birthday candle. The kitchen also sent us complimentary spicy crab cakes which we the best I have ever had.\n\nThey say you will always see someone famous there. We sat a table away from ESPN's Scott VanPelt, haven't the faintest idea who is, but my husband was pretty stoked.Heard Pete Rose was in there the night before, but we ran into him signing autographs in the Bellagio anways. \n\nI wish a diamond would have come with my steak, and I guess that's my only negative comment.....! Worth every penny (even though it was a lot of pennies :))"

We ordered oysters, did all Kumamoto, .  The steak of choice was the dry aged bone in ribeye, and I wasn't disappointed.  It was soft and juicy, cooked to perfection and you knew it was a dry aged beef.  Well done n9ne, you really got that aged process down to perfection!  I ordered the truffle fries  and that was the best truffle fries by far.  A person in our party asked for ketchup, with funny looks from our party, why would you need ketchup but the waiter politely brought it to our table.  And would you know, this was the best tasting ketchup ever!!!!!  Don't take my word for it, ask to try it.  It's not your normal from the bottle red sauce, it's there own creation kicked up a notch.  We didn't have room for desserts, for the portions were very generous.  We left very satisfied and as raggedly as we were dressed, no one treated us as second class citizens, they treated and served our party with respect and graciousness as would be expected from a fine dinning establishment.  Thank you N9NE, you guys are definitely on our repeat visit list in Vegas!!!!"

All were good but not \"scrumptiouslydelicioso\".  The sides were more intriguing...like the Lobster Mac n cheese, but the notable dish was the Gnocchi, it was deeeelish.  \n\nDesserts were creative with a build your own Smores plate, Root Beer Float w/ some kinda Root Beer in the bottle from Chicago?\n\nOverall a fun, hip, chic dining experience....be ready for the $$$, but that's to be expected for this type of venue...and in the company of 7 lovely ladies, I'd say it was worth it!"

A friend and I decided to stop one evening to check out the Vegas location.  The space is as I remembered.  Modern, glamorous, etc.  It feels a little dated for the times as it carries the same decor from when the concept first launched.  It has a disco type vibe and is too bright of restaurant in my opinion.  It definitely doesn't have the same sexiness as some of the other higher end venues in Vegas.  \n\nThe service was good although the focus seemed to be scattered.  They were filming scenes for Mob Wives that night we were there so that made for an interesting experience.\n\nAs for the food... It was on point.  The garbage salad was a great start to the evening.  It has a culmination of a bunch of ingredients you would put in different salads including artichokes, heart of palm, shrimp, salami, kale, etc.  \n\nWe also order the prime rib cap served with onions and shishito peppers and the scallops on top of a green onion risotto.  Both were absolutely delicious and perhaps two of my favorite entrees of all-time.  I HIGHLY recommend them.  I'll definitely be back in the future for the food.  Consider this review a 4.5 rounded up."

Jeremy was much more friendly, personable, and professional than the first.\n\nWe received the prix fixe menu, which is a 4 course meal (+amuse) at a great value at only $65pp! This also includes wine pairings with the price!  However, since we ordered cocktails, we did not receive the wine pairings...if that is a big deal, you probably have to specify that you want both, and to also get drunk LOL.\n\nIt came with an edamame amuse :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9ne-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#a_nxb70YKk-IRXxcSlxo3A\n\nAnd a tasting of their famous Garbage Salad and Onion Soup. The salad didn't do much for me, albeit good (don't really eat lettuce) :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9ne-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#z6fsTgxVzPsoUDjwD-NDDA\n\nBut the onion soup was amazing! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9ne-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#j6-CzRYKH7NNPFLgpL8eqg\n\nThe onions were perfectly cooked, where there is no onion taste or crispiness consistency, and they were hiding under a layer of Gruy\u00e8re cheese and Garlic Croutons!  Probably the best I've had...but I do not order this dish often.\n\nThe Fish dishes were the highlight of the night for me. The Striped Sea Bass was beautifully cooked with a gorgeous crust and had tons of flavor! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9ne-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#cR_uORMavJ_I6Ha6gm0cSA\n\nSalmon for similar reasons! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9ne-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#Zr0AZbZf8ljMGLVadKyCdg\n\nThey both came dressed the same, being Saut\u00e9ed, with Escarole & Beans, Black Garlic, Pancetta, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil...Yum!  Seriously the best fish I've had prepared for a while!\n\nThe Prime Ribeye steak was a touch overcooked from medium rare, but there was great flavor here, and the fat was very edible. Actually, the meat itself pulled apart with a fork, a benefit of a quality thin cut of beef for sure! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9ne-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#8yZX0kWk9ZERqSZg49F1Mw\n\nDon't expect aged beef flavor here, but it was a great cut and plate! It comes with three sauces on the side, a Creamy Horseradish, Au Poivre and B\u00e9arnaise Sauce. Thankfully, the steak didn't NEED any of them, but I played around with the tastes here and there.  Too bad it was a thin cut though...but the amount of food we had beforehand didn't merit needing a 24oz'r or anything huge.  Plus, considering the costs of the prix fixe, it is still a great deal.\n\nThe sides were not extraordinary...the Parmesan Mashed Potatoes and Green Bean Casserole were good though.  \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9ne-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#urrnRSz_Shk38FQpm-nyHg\n\nI had the Lobster Mashed Potatoes last time here and they were the best I've had...so I knew this one would fall short.  Still good though!  The Green Beans were tender, and didn't have that waxy snap that I loathe on GBs, so they were good, but still green beans LOL.\n\nThe Organic Fire Chicken was great, with its Shaved Lemon, Jalapenos, and Rosemary Jus! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9ne-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#flaapZxGxocTpp-MC8Km0w\n\nThe plating was large, and had tons of flavor! I like how they had white and dark meat on the plate, and the seasoning and taste was great! One of the better Chicken dishes I've had in a while!\n\nAnd last but not least, the dessert was an assorted mix of pastries, all of which were good! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9ne-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#Up9o_jvfL71vRKo9KPGFvA\n\nI'd substitute variety any day, versus a huge singular dessert that I wouldn't be able to finish anyways! Also, the espresso came with a cool rock candy garnish :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9ne-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#e-BV7hm6SykBvr15Bxj9ig\n\nFun and enjoyable to stir the espresso!  It's the little details that can make all the difference.\n\nLong story short, this is proof that, given another opportunity, a second chance can be a much better experience!"

I was extremely impressed when we arrived, as the restaurant itself was beautiful and trendy, but I was a little put off by the loud clubby music inside. We took a seat at the bar to wait for our table and ordered some delicious drinks, I cant remember what mine was called as our server recommended it, but it had fresh raspberries and was to die for. Once we were seated, our waiter welcomed us with his fun, friendly, and unique personality. He was fabulous, I wish I could recall his name. I ordered the plate of oysters which were absolutely fantastic, some of the best oysters we've ever had! I knew of course I was going to order a steak for dinner, and we both opted for the Filet Mignon. In addition, we ordered the Lobster Mashed Potatoes and the Sauteed Mushrooms & Onions. WOW. All I can say is we were absolutely floored at the decadence of our meal. The steak was like butter, you didn't even need a knife to cut through it. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and melted in your mouth. The potatoes had HUGE chunks of lobster and were so creamy and delicious. Of course, the mushrooms and onions complimented the steak SO perfectly. As I previously mentioned, the loud music made it difficult to have a normal conversation, so I could have done without it. But we were so busy filling our faces with the amazing food to care! I wish we would have ordered dessert, but I was so full that I couldn't eat another bite. For the rest of our trip, all we could talk about was the food at N9NE and wished we could go back and eat that steak again. I will DEFINITELY return here next time I'm in Vegas, I cant wait to try more of what they have to offer. Be prepared to spend good money to dine here, but it's worth it. If I could give 6 stars, I would!"

It wasn't a horrible experience but I won't be coming back."

The atmosphere here is not even nice hotel restaurant level, more family restaurant.\n\nThe hostesses are obviously hired for looks only.  They group together around the hostess stand and wait for you to approach rather than welcoming the guests coming through the door.  No smiles, no inviting greeting.\n\nThe food is really pretty good, but for this price, it had better be.  My wife did have to return her steak to the kitchen as it was served \"cold\", but they refired a new one and it came out perfect.  I understand that these kinds of things happen and our server was more than gracious in rectifying the situation. The dessert menu is a must, so save room.\n\nWhat really downgrades my rating though, is the lack of dress code or acceptable attire.  Most folks were at least dressed nicely for a night out, think club attire, but there were others in shorts and flip-flops.  Seated in the middle of the room, for all to see, was a group of eight in shorts and T-shirts, with the men wearing backwards baseball hats. \n\nThere is no way I can justify the prices charged for a crowd that belongs at the Outback.  N9ne has to drop the price or get a Ma\u00eetre D' to provide the proper atmosphere.  The failure for me lies all with management."

Most restaurants, like most people, have an area of weakness. In my two visits to N9NE, I have yet to find theirs. \n\nEverything is good. The scallops are fantastic, the lobster mac and cheese is... well, lobster mac and cheese, the cocktail list is inventive, and, while you'll be hard pressed to find less than stellar service anywhere in Vegas, that at N9NE is a step above the rest. Food, service, cocktails, ambiance... N9NE is the complete 5 star package.\n\nThe best of the best? The surf in turf is stacked (cited from the bottom up): mashed potatoes, a mouth watering filet, and de-shelled lobster, which is then topped with a truffle cream sauce. Yea.\n\nIf I were to dare speak a bad word about N9NE, it would only be that as rich and heavy as the food here is it doesn't always make for the best \"party till the sun comes up in my barely there Vegas-only attire\" precursor. After dinner in both of my experiences I felt a lot more like going and trying out the plush hotel beds you pay an arm and a leg for and never use than I did raging. In an effort to keep the party going, I suggest a round of espresso cocktail shots for the table.\n\nPrices are steep. Luckily money and calories aren't an object in my heaven."

We should have gone here instead of going to Alize upstairs on the night of our wedding. The vibe at N9NE is young, hip and chic (but no one is out of place). If you don't mind paying a lot of money for really good food, then this is the place for you. I had the wedge salad, the 16 oz. bone-in filet with a king crab leg, and a wonderful wheat beer. Although you are going to pay an arm and a leg for the food (we paid $350), I believe it was WELL worth it.\n\nI disagree with Jordan A. - you would expect a place like this to be pretentious - but the staff that we encountered (hostess, waiter, bus boys) were all very nice, and very attentive. Although we don't have a lot of money, we never felt out of place or that anyone was looking down at us. We were treated very well."

We were staying at the casino and we initially wanted to eat at Gordon Ramsey Steak but they had no reservations. We called N9ne steakhouse and the hostess were very accomadating. When we arrived, we were greeted with professional looking people at the host stand. We were seated right away and the atmosphere was quiet and calm. It wasn't dead, but it wasn't CRAZY busy. Our server, Adrianne Zach (she gave us her business card), came to our table and greeted us, gave us time for our menu choices, and made us feel catered to. There wasn't a time we had to call her to our table. Our waters were always filled on time, and she was always smiling. Being someone who used to be a hostess and a bartender, I understand how frustrating some customers can be and she was doing very well. Very impressed.  I ordered the filet mignon and it was so soft and bursting with flavor. The cheese corn (I think it's called) was my favorite. It was so good. I have to say, I'm glad STEAK couldn't take our reservation. I don't think I would have ever been to this hidden gem if that didn't happen. The staff was great from the moment I walked in to the moment I got to the table, to the moment I walked out. My husband and I completely agree that this place is so much better than other famous steakhouses and the service from Adrianne was unmatchable. We look young so servers usually treat us like high schoolers thinking we won't tip well. We're back in L.A now but we talk about Nine steakhouse to everyone we know till this day. Hoping to go back there soon. *steak dreams* Hope Adrianne is still there when we go back! (Ask for her)"

The 44oz Tomahawk ribeye is served pre-sliced on a very large platter, perfectly cooked (medium rare) with an amazing side of lobster mac and cheese and a generous side of mixed grilled vegetables.  And as a garnish they sit the foot long bone on top.  It's what dreams are made of, my dreams anyway.\n\nExcellent marbling throughout and while it also comes with some red wine based sauce on the side, the tasty beef can and should just be savored on its own.  Both the steak and the mac and cheese definitely make my all-time list of best in each category.  On the menu the dish is labeled as a dish for two and given the amount of food and cost I recommend splitting it with at least one other.\n\nThe other guys in my party ordered various cuts of standard ribeyes, aged ribeyes, filets, porterhouses and all the plates were a thing of beauty.  Everyone left N9NE stuffed, satisfied and ready to conquer the night.  Definitely the dining highlight of the weekend trip."

This sucked because I would've loved to have enjoyed my wine with my steak. Empty plates were left on our table for a while. Bottom line, having been in the service industry, at this food price point, I expect much better service. The food was overall not very flavorful either, which was a big let down for the price.

The N9NE Steakhouse also features fresh seafood and an exclusive champagne and caviar bar.\n\nYour first-class experience with N9NE starts when you walk through an elegant--and not overdone--entryway. You may miss it at first, if you're used to the glitzier places that shine bright but don't deliver. You're greeted with a purple flower arrangement against a cream-colored stone wall, then turn left as the space stretches, heightens, and expands before you. It felt a little like walking into Ry\u014dan-ji, Japan's most famous Zen rock garden; the space is well-filled, yet allows room for imagination. The colors are vibrant, alluring, while surprisingly soft; the effect is slow, steady, non-disruptive attraction.\n\nThe first two female hosts were luminescent, with an authentic beauty that matched the surroundings.  The space unfolds into polished bar, lounge, and dining area. They've been open since 2001, yet everything looked new, gleaming.\n\nWhile waiting for my friend, I enjoyed a house Cabernet at the bar, soon engaging in a spirited conversation with a nearby patron, Brad, and another unique beauty, the Bulgarian bartender. The atmosphere felt inviting and organic; nothing standoffish or scripted.\n\nOnce my friend arrived we were seated in the dining area. The waiter's initial welcome speech, which included specials, steaks, and entrees, sounded so lush, interesting, and extraordinary, I wanted him to do it again for video. He laughed. For appetizers we enjoyed Lobster Pot Stickers--bok choy, shiitake mushrooms, chile-ginger sauce; then their signature N9NE Rock Shrimp in crispy, spicy sriracha sauce and lemon aioli.\n\nMy friend, Jane, tried the Dover Sole Special, a succulent and meaty flat fish from the flounder family, topped with rock shrimp and artichoke. She couldn't stop smiling.\n\nMontana, where I'm from, has top shelf steakhouses in nearly every town. The state abounds with large open ranges and healthy wild animals. The 22oz bone-in ribeye that I ordered reminded me of the best steaks back home:  fresh, tender, and deep natural flavors.\n\nThe doughnut dessert, accompanied by raspberries, almonds, white chocolate sauce and milk chocolate sauce, looked like a work of art. It tasted like one too.\n\nCandles flickered, conversation flowed, warm colors enveloped us. Other patrons appeared merry, satiated, glowing. It's hard to leave restaurants like this!"

It looks like they have a pretty solid $59 three course prix fixe if you get there early enough from 5:00-7:00 pm. We arrived a little bit after and waited until our entire party was present to be seated. Unlike many steakhouses that opt for a dimmer dining environment, N9NE's renovated dining room takes on a more contemporary look with lounge-inspired lighting. The table cloth was annoyingly long as it kept catching on our chair legs. \n\nThe bread basket was the first to arrive shortly after we were seated. I liked the variety of bread and pretzel offered, but my biggest pet peeve was the cold, solid refrigerated butter. The chef quickly made up for that with a complimentary offering of salmon cakes. For appetizers, if you check-in on Yelp, they offer a free appetizer or dessert. The appetizer was a four piece short-rib ravioli topped with chanterelle mushrooms and pancetta. \n\nMy steak was the 14 oz. prime New York sirloin. Like most snooty steakhouses, sauces and sides are all extra. The steak itself was inconsistent with the crust and dry in some areas. The medium rare was only true in the very center, but overall it was average - better than what you would receive from a chain, but less than that of some of the nicer Strip steakhouses."

They saw on my reservation I had a tomato allergy so I heard her tell the other host to make sure the chef knew about my allergy so I appreciated that. \n\nRestaurant was beautiful. Seating, table and lighting. Few things didn't make sense the art on the walls and football playing. I know football is important on Sundays, but people at the bar were loud and made the quiet ambiance of the restaurant not so special. Just didn't seem like the restaurant to play that type of stuff. \n\nServer Robert was one of the best I've had in vegas in a while as a local. I told him what I was in the mood for wine, app and entree wise and had him order his favorites for us. \n\nI heard they had Kumamoto Oysters so I ordered those and blue point oysters from NY both very good. Blue points were very Meaty and flavorful and Kumamotos had a sweet cucumber finish. I ordered two jumbo shrimp and man were these things JUMBO! Great size and flavor-worth the money. So great Raw bar selection.\n\nI checked in on Yelp! and got a free appetizer (or dessert) and got the short rib ravioli. That was amazing. Had like a cream sauce with corn on it. Very satisfying.\n\nRobert paired a great white wine with the raw bar selection. Brancott Sauvignon Blanc to be exact. \n\nThen I had Robert select two steaks for my partner and I. I needed only a spoon to cut these steaks they were cooked so perfectly. I had the Bone in Filet 14oz. My partner had a 22oz bone in Ribeye. \n\nI ordered the regular Mac and cheese and the lobster Mac and cheese came out. I don't complain ever unless it has to do with my allergy. Wasn't crazy about the lobster. It was kinda rubbery. Was surprised with the other raw bar items being so great. Maybe it was how it was cooked but I can't be picky about a side dish when the steaks were so great! wouldn't hurt to have the steaks maybe come with some fries or veggies when you are paying $68 a cut. \n\nRobert paired a great Cabernet Sauvignon from Alexander Valley to go with the steaks. It's rare I trust people to pick my wine but he seemed to be a seasoned veteran at his job and I respect that. \n\nDessert menu came but I honestly just couldn't do it. I was so full from the great selection of breads to the raw bar to the steaks. Next time I will leave room for the dessert because I looked at the menu and it looked amazing. I'm sure they taste amazing and take their time with presentation!\n\nThan you for a great night out on our staycation!"

The service was excellent. The meal flowed and we never felt neglected or intruded by our waiter. On to the food....Mmmmm!\n\n\nFor starters, we had the shashimi and calamari. I loved the dipping sauce for the calamari and the shahimi tasted fresh. The portion was perfect for the three  of us to share. We all got a little of everything. The bread was also excellent with different selections to choose from in a perfectly arranged basket.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered  the rib eye for two with lobster tails added on. I loved how the rib eye was already sliced for us. It made it easy for sharing. The portion, 40 oz  I believe, was perfect for 2 piggies. BUT the main attraction was neither the steak or lobster. The twice baked potato. OMG was absolutely the BEST I've ever had. It was so creamy and they did not skimp on the black truffle shavings. The flavors was just spectacular. For sides, we had asparagus, spinach, mac n cheese and creamed corn. All were just okay but you just can't beat the truffle twice baked potato. My mom had the 8 oz filet which she said was perfect.\n\nFor dessert we had the a cake thing with burnt caramel ice cream. The burnt caramel ice cream was SOOOOOOOOOO good. Yummy!\n\n\nIt was a great meal. Although I would like to say the other sides were okay so minus a star. Otherwise a perfect meal."

The bartender was nice enough but seemed a bit put out when asked about various martinis. Anyway, once seated the service was good, even if our waiter seemed a little \"green.\" It did take a while so I was glad we gave extra time before our Cirque show at 10 because we almost ended up being late. So, give yourself plenty of time here.\n\nOur booth was nice and big but because the music was pretty loud (although a nice, wide variety of music - interesting!) I had trouble hearing the two people not sitting right next to me throughout dinner. The waiter recommended the meatloaf special for me since I love it but I was disappointed that it was overly salty without any other real flavor other than meat. It was like a meat block that required a knife to cut it. Interesting. Everyone else liked their food and my friend raved about the salmon but when I tasted it, it was way to salty also! Two other friends agreed so it wasn't just me.\n\nNice little touches were the cupcake shots brought over to sample and the foie gras samples from the chef. In addition, because my friend noted to the waiter that his drink wasn't on our bill, the waiter then comped us another 4 shots. These kinds of things make a big impression in my book. Overall I think we all enjoyed this place."

I loved the dessert, although the other three at our table were nonplussed - but I'm not letting their opinion upset my delight and I'm happy to give n9ne a 5 star rating!

I'm so thankful that our server did tell us it would be. My husband loved the oyster so much that he wanted more. He wasn't sure if he necessarily wanted a half dozen because I wasn't eating any. He just wanted an order of the 3 oysters that came with it. Our server told us she would talk to the chef and find out if he could order those three which were 3 different oysters and she worked it out so it was perfect! Plus, I forgot to mention, they brought us 2 complimentary glasses of champagne for our anniversary. Very nice and unexpected touch! My husband also ordered the steak tartar, I'm not into that and I read really good reviews on it. Well I think it was the only downside of our meal. He found it to be yes an abundance of meat yet it lacked seasoning.\n\nI ordered the surf n turf and FYI it is not on the menu on Mondays. I believe she said it was only on the weekend, so again they accommodated our request. That is top notch service to me. And by the way, it was spectacular!! My steak was a perfect medium, my lobster was perfectly, I mean PERFECTLY, cooked.  It came with some kind of truffle sauced mash potato. Delicious! I couldn't finish it all.  \n\nMy husband ordered the bone in rib-eye for his entree, medium rare. It was more on the medium side for his liking, but still really good, the quality if the steak shined through. He also ordered the gnocchi with truffle cream, OMG it was spectacular!! Something I would never order and it was amazing! Too many carbs, but so worth it! Exquisite dish. We couldn't finish that or even half of our entrees.  . We took It Back to the hotel room and ate it 2 hours later!! Still so wonderful! Like little soft pillows of delightful bliss, amazing!\n\nNo room for dessert. But an amazing dinner! Service was great! We couldn't ask for anything more!!"

            "review": "I'm rating this place solely on the food/service.  I can't comment on whether or not the nightlife here makes the experience better.  We came during what must have been a down night as the only thing that made this place a club like atmosphere was the easily recognizable radio songs, expensive alcohol and strange lighting. \n\nWe were seated promptly next to the center bar.  It was early and there were other tables full of people, but the restaurant was mostly empty.  The random assortment of bread was nothing to write home about, and I've spent enough time on it here.  There is a rather extensive daily menu, which serves to supplement their rather bare normal menu.  Nothing spectacular though, but if you're wavering it might make sense to call in and see what else they might have.\n\nWe started with the rockshrimp appetizer, which was decently prepared and salted if nothing special.  You get chopsticks to eat it with though.  The kind that come in a wrapper without instructions on how to use chopsticks.  Classy.  Since the menu did not have a bone-in NY, I opted for the 22 oz bone-in porterhouse, medium rare.  We also ordered the gnocchi as a side, which is one of t he few times we've gone against popular Yelp opinion on sides.\n\n I have to comment on the service though.  Poor at this point is how it should be described.  Our appetizers were never cleared from our table, and sat in front of us, clearly done for a good 5-10 minutes.  When our steak arrived, the server had to remove our empty plates to set down our entrees.  He was surprised as he had to put our entrees back onto his platter.  That is unacceptable for the type of restaurant it is supposed to be.  When there is a head waiter, second waiter, water guy and server, something this simple should not go unnoticed on their part.\n\nWe got our steak, and due to the poor lighting it was extremely difficult to tell by inspection how it was cooked.  Visuals don't matter though, taste does.  I'm pretty sure my steak was closer to a medium than to a medium rare though.  I'd be much more sure if they did not overuse the peppercorn on it.  The spice use was far too heavy handed, and really hid the flavor of meat. I was disappointed in the steak, but finished it.  I normally am tempted to pick up the bone and start gnawing on it, not here though.  It was not neceessarily bad, just not worth the price.  \n\nI had a bit of lobster and lobster mashed potatoes that my gf wound up with.  I'm glad we went against the lobster mashed potatoes though.  That was just strange.  Some things should not be combined and lobster is definitely a stand alone item to my tastes.  The gnocchi however was pretty tasty and very different.  I'm glad we chose that and even managed to clear that plate up.  We finished up and service was once again slow to get our dessert menus.  We went with the chocolate banana cream pie under 2 assumptions; I love banana cream pies and we would probably never come back.  \n\nTurns out the dessert was the most entertaining part of the meal.  Presentation of it was awesome (see picture posted above) and it was pretty tasty and definitely worth the price.  It had a lot going on with it, but I enjoyed each flavor, particularly the caramelized bananas.\n\nOne last word of note, there is a bathroom attendant, so don't head in there unless you got a couple ones on you.  I wanted to make a bad pun about his job as he seemed pretty laid back, but I somehow managed to not and grabbed a jolly rancher from the tray and left.  All in all, I suppose on an on-night this place might be a great time, but if you're looking for food and service that is above average, look elsewhere."

This would have been a problem if there were people sitting there since the stools end up being right at eye level and very close to the table.  Next time I'll be sure to request a booth (a room layout is on their website).  i didn't care for the decor.  The music wasn't as loud as i expected.  if only they were playing Christmas pop songs!\n\nI started off with a peach lychee martini, very delightful with fruit bits floating around in it.  We shared the rock shrimp appetizer.  It doesn't say on the menu that it is fried and served in an old-fashioned popcorn box!  I just loved this amusing presentation.  I passed on the lobster bisque since I was going to Aquaknox the next day.  I did order the surf and turf and wavered on the lobster mashed potatoes.  Though I have had lobster before, I made it at home for the first time the day prior.  I would say that home method is way cheaper, so easy, and the results not far from this restaurant!  The lobster on the entree was a mere single (large) claw split in half!  This sat atop a nicely done filet and (gasp) lobster mashed potatoes.  It was very difficult to judge by sight if the filet was cooked to medium rare.  The lighting is so awful, and the whole piece looked brown all the way through.  Later the overall lighting changed to a more pink hue showing off the rare center.  Very bizarre lighting.  The red wine sauce is good, though a little overpowering.  Another detail that amused me was that the plate was set down exactly such that the n9ne logo was at the nine o'clock hour.  For the side we shared the gnocchi, which was prepared like no other gnocchi I had ever seen before.  It's very smooth in the inside and crispy on the outside.  I probably ate 2/3 of the dish.  Its small size is very deceiving on its ability to be filling!  Other tables had what must have been skinny fries - literally a mountain of fries that no one could finish.  Although everyone seemed to be ordering s'mores for dessert, we went with the chocolate banana cream pie.  Again a wonderful n9ne presentation!  The pie itself was small and the crust very bitter, but I enjoyed the additional caramelized bananas on the side.  Lots of fun and hope to return!"

But the curved shape of the table didn't allow us all to talk or even see each other. Wait staff was excellent and good looking. Not a good date place because you can't hear yourself talk. Very lounge like with a hip club vibe.\nSeafood appetizer came out on ice and was very, very good. Huge, gianormous shrimp cocktail. Specialize in desserts. Carrot cake satisfied 6 of us with one portion, while their yummy root beer floats added a twist t their menu option. Had the fillet mignon. $46 for the 8 oz. You have to order the sides separately and share if family style. The asparagus was very good as well.\nCo-worker loved the crusted salmon. \"To die for!\" And the salad selection could be a meal on its own.\nGo there hungry. Make a reservation. Not your ordinary, stuffy steakhouse."

Service is always prompt and the food never fails to amaze me. The Surf and Turf is one of the best deals in town and you have to try the calamari or the popcorn shrimp for starters. Was there recently with a party of ten celebrating a friends birthday. Even though we were a larger group and were going through some serious cocktails and bottles of wine our server was on top of everything which was no small feat especially since it was during peak period on a Saturday night. everyones entree was cooked perfectly and the timing of the meal was impeccable. I can't say a bad thing about this place."

Well, maybe a Ditch Friday...and GBDC...and the Pearl...and the diner rueben... OK, fine. I would've been at The Palms. But I didn't see a 5-star meal coming from here. Enter N9NE.  \n\nThrough the grapevine (yelp) I heard about this $65 AYCD 5-course prix fixe and since I had a date to impress, to N9NE we went! On a Monday at 6:45 the place was nearly empty. It's an odd looking spot. A giganto bar in the middle of the dining room and little to no decoration to be found. \n\nAny who, before I could really look around a friendly white coated waiter came over with some menus. I didn't even snag a look at it and went straight for the prix fixe. Off the waiter went and returned with a white wine. He went into a speech about it, but I stopped him and told him to pour first and ask questions later. He obliged, filled the glasses tall and went on his way. Class personified. The service was terrific throughout. \n\nHere's how the meal went...\nAmuse Bouche: \nPotato and celery soup - Small cup came out and wasn't as heavy as I expect most potato soups to be. You could definitely detect the celery flavor. \n\nStarters: \nFrench onion soup and garbage salad (a salad with a bit of everything) - LOVVEE both of these in concept and N9NE did them well. Bits of bleu cheese, olives, salami, tomato and others all over salad is always a good time. The soup was on point. Gooey cheese and salty broth make me a happy camper.\n\nFish: *Note: I am buzzed at this point\nStriped Sea Bass (Saut\u00e9ed, Escarole & Beans, Black Garlic, Pancetta, Extra Virgin Olive Oil)- This was solid. Crunchy top with light bites of fish underneath. Next time I would probably skip this step and leave more room for the meat.  \n\nEntree: *Note- I am drunk now and the red wine has entered the picture\nPrime Ribeye Steak with grilled asparagus and parmesan mashed potatoes  - This bad boy was cooked perfectly rare and had was served in a plate of its own juices. Smooth move. If that wasn't enough, it was also served with 3 side sauces (Creamy Horseradish, Au Poivre and B\u00e9arnaise Sauce). Don't even bother with these. Although really salty (IMO), the crust was extremely flavorful and the piece was easy to cut. Not the best steak I've had this year, but doable. \n\nDessert: \n- 3 mini pieces of a peanut butter cup, carrot cake (bomb!) and cheesecake. All fun, but you should prob be full by now. \n\nSo, about those 5-stars. The food was FAR from perfect, but the experience was great. Anytime I leave a place full, tipsy and satisfied with a lady in hand (who was feeling the same), I'm more than just 'a fan'. Let's call it a generous 5 with a suggestion to have your next date night here. \n\nTip: check out the worlds smallest TV's in the bathroom"

Honestly I can't even remember it.\n--Service was pretty darn slow. Yes, we had a table of 15 people but this is Vegas and that scenario is extremely common. Everything felt a half hour behind schedule.\n\nThe Bad:\n--seafood platter had 1) a pleasant large cold shrimp, 2) underwhelming pieces of cold crab meat, and 3) the blandest lobster tail I've ever had in my life -  no joke. It was utterly devoid of flavor. \n--the steak; properly cooked, tender meat, but criminally over salted. I'm talking \"tongue writhing with dehydration\" salty. I THINK I could taste some steak under all the seasoning. Most everyone in my party agreed.\n\nSummary:\n--Don't be fooled by this \"high end\" steakhouse. Just because they nonsensically have a number in their name and charge a pretty penny doesn't mean you're getting good food. In fact, I'd probably have enjoyed a meal at Outback more and payed a third of what I did here."

However, I want to review now, noting various aspects  that stand out in my mind so that others can use the info wisely.  \n\nBrought an out of town guest here for dinner based on some of the more positive, glowing reviews which made me think this would be an awesome terrific  place for my guest.  Wrong!  The evening started out okay, walked in and really loved the look of the restaurant , the lighting, etc. Sat down, placed our orders. So far so good.   I had the cheapest thing on the menu (the burger), my guest had one of the steaks (can't remember which one now).  Not that it really matters.  After  being there a mere 15 minutes, the loudest, most ear shattering music I have ever heard  started up. It was like being in the middle of a full on dance club at blast levels.   My guest and I looked at each other and couldn't believe the noise levels.  Seriously.  Unable to hear each other or carry on a conversation, the evening quickly became a lousy experience.  \n\nMy burger was nothing special, like eating a slightly above average diner burger.  Guest didn't care much for her steak. I think we had dessert but can't remember what it was, so obviously it made zero impression.  The only food item that was a standout was the bread/rolls.  It was DIVINE, and I tried to track down the source later to purchase and seemed to find it at a local artisan bakery but then the bakery moved so I lost track of the only thing that made an impression from the evening at Palms.  However, a great bread/roll  (if they still even have that particular bread), is NOT enough to drag me kicking and screaming back to this place.  My hearing luckily recovered after spending a miserable  hour in the horrible  ear blasting atmosphere of N9NE, couldn't wait to get out of there and was very embarrassed that i'd brought my once a year out of town guest to this hyped joint.  If you're the type of person who wants to eat in an atmosphere that's at least halfway bearable, avoid this place!  The food is nothing special, it's overpriced and apart from the bread, it's not a place to waste your money on.  Sad!"

We figured this would be a great opportunity to try out a bunch of different restaurants before we decide which are worth fully indulging in later.\n\nWe started out with the onion soup and what was supposed to be a Cesar salad, which it was not(we will get to that later). The onion soup I did not care for(although I LOVE onions), nor did the people at the two tables beside me apparently.....The salad I had, the garbage salad, however was quite a delicious mix of flavors. The ribeye steak itself was delicious , very flavor packed. It is probably one of the better steaks I've had compared to the numerous pricey steaks I've had at other fine dining restaurants. For dessert we had mini tiramisu, strawberry cheesecake, and pecan pie tasters. Those were delicious as well.\n\nNow as to why I deducted two stars. When we first arrived, our waiter said dessert would be profiteroles for the night. Great, I love profiteroles....but that's not what we ended up with!....what a bummer. Second, when we received our appetizer soup and salads we were supposed to have Cesar salads, as he set down our plates he even said 'Cesar salad'! But instead we had what I now know as the garbage salad. Clearly cesar salad does not have salami, shrimp, artichokes, shallots, olives, and blue cheese in it. Third, when our rib-eyes came out they were accompanied with a mushroom with a stem of rosemary poked through...he said it was a horseradish stem!......I myself cook regularly and knew that was not a horseradish stem. I was quite appalled at how he tried to pass off his lack of knowledge and attention to detail on us. I sat there in confusion as we received each part of our meal and each time I had to check with my husband that I heard what I heard. Our server honestly didn't look like he cared for his job as he was too distracted by the preseason NFL games on TV near the back of the restaurant and he sure didn't check on us during our meal or ask if we were enjoying our food. \n\nNonetheless, the food was spectacular but the service was quite poor due to our waiter."

            "review": "N9NE was one of the more interesting steakhouses I've been to.  It felt like walking into a restaurant that was trying to become a nightclub or lounge, but not quite succeeding on any front. Its food keeps it from becoming a notable steakhouse, and its weird ambiance prevents it from being a trendy hangout spot.\n\nOur large group ordered a variety of foods and appetizers that we all sampled, so I'll start with my thoughts on what I ordered: First, I started with a smoked bacon caesar salad, which I was excited to order, but was somewhat disappointed.  The lettuce and kale was VERY mushy, it was drowning in too much dressing and cheese that it was almost a thick soup instead of a salad.  My entree was a nice fat porterhouse, which was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. Kudos to the chef who grilled it! For dessert I ordered the cheesecake, which was tasty but nothing special- it was more artistic that in it was memorable.  I also sampled several dishes of the other members of my party.  The filet mignon and the sirloin were both very delicious.  I also tried the Fire Chicken, which I felt was just so-so, and the salmon, which was good (not great).  So my conclusion is that the food was good, but definitely not worth the high prices.  For the same price, you could go to a real steakhouse on the strip.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a weird vibe to it.  IMO, a nice steakhouse should be classy with a relaxed atmosphere, and a nightclub should have loud music and crazy lighting.  N9NE feels like it unsuccessfully fused the two together- a classy dining area that is lit in a weird neon purple glow, with couches next to the bar and hostesses dressed ready for a night on the town.  The lighting is so weird that it makes everything look like it's in one big tanning bed.  In case you can't tell, I was not a fan of the overall look and feel of this place.\n\nOverall, although I had a pleasant enough time eating here, I would not be returning.  I can get higher quality food elsewhere for the same price, and it won't look like a loud 80s night club."

Some of the tables are placed a bit too close together, so try to ask for a booth if you want some privacy. \n\nThe steaks here are amazing! I always go with the surf n turf, which includes an 8 oz filet mignon and a maine lobster (claw and tail!). If you're not a fan of filet, don't worry- you can easily surf with the steak of your choice. For appetizers, the fried rock shrimp is a must try! As for the side dishes, the truffle gnocchi is heavenly. The staff is also very accommodating here...we noticed they had mac n cheese as a side, but not lobster mac n cheese like we're used to at many other steakhouses! So we requested for lobster to be added and the kitchen had no problems fulfilling our request :)\n\nOh, and since I love carbs, naturally one of my favorite parts of the meal is the serving of bread! Here, you get 3 types of bread- some kind of corn bread muffin, tomato focaccia, and a bacon-cheddar horn. Yum yum!"

I made our resrevations 2 months in advance, and was told to look out for an email confirmation. After 2 weeks when it didn't come I called in to confirm and they said they would send an email again. Again, it didn't come - in fact, it never came. Being that it was for a bachelorette dinner on a very booked weekend, I needed to have some sort of confirmation. So it was troublesome to have to call in repeatedly to  confirm. Finally they day arrives and we look forward to one of the best meals ever. Unfortuantely, the chefs were a bit salt shaker happy because almost EVERYTHING was TOO salty - it ruined everything! None of us could finish a single plate. It was so sad. A $60 steak and only four bites from it. I only finished two of my five scallops. I complained to our waiter, and thankfully they tried to make up for it by sending us several desserts. That was the only highlight of the dinner. Still, not worth the almost thousand we spent that night. Our waiter was very cool, but we will never go again. Since then, I have been to Strip Steak twice and have never been failed. I'm going to Vegas again in two weeks and my sister said she wanted to try N9ne - I said no way in hezzy - we'll be at Stripe Steak for sure - hell, I'd rather be at Black Angus then N9ne."

It's one of those \"living large\" splurges you must do if you love good food, more specifically...great meat!

The meat comes in a skillet, tantalizing you with its smells and juices. Every time it's so rich, moist, velvety and buttery.... I just don't know...

The service was adequate and that is the only reason they get a star at all.  The rib eye at Longhorn is heads and shoulders better than the one I had at N9ne.

This is some of the best vodka (although not pricey and has won several awards) available. I loved that we were able to sit in the bar lounge area and have a few drinks before we sat down at our dinner table. \n\n\nDinner started out with appetizers:\n\nN9NE Rock Shrimp: Small, bite size, sweet with the perfect breading, crunchy and a mouth full of sunshine.\n\nCalamari: Fried perfectly, seasoned well and a perfect \"spicy\" dipping sauce.

I felt like a sophisticated girl scout. \n\nI was lucky enough to have such a great dinner and a great experience. We were greeted many times by the Executive Chef.

I thought it was especially a nice touch that our champagne was kept on ice and refilled when our glasses were low.\n\nWe ordered the tomahawk platter which is a huge ribeye steak with the beef back rib still connected so it's like two feet long. It's a really awesome visual! We also got marrow bones, lobster mac and cheese, and seasonal vegetables which were all tremendous. We've never had bone marrow before (usually give to the animals) so that was a cool addition. Steak was on point and there are no complaints about their beef. \n\nAll in all we racked up 300 dollars worth of a tab on two items but it was worth it especially being visitors and treating my wife to a night out. There are bathrooms that are located once you walk inside the restaurant which is nice because some have you go outside into the casino which sucks! We will definitely be back when we visit Vegas again!"

None of that matters. \n\nAll that matters is that you save up some $$ (because it's pricey as hell) and head on over to N9NE and order yourself a porterhouse with a side of jumbo shrimp scampi (AMAZING) and ruin your life forever, because you will never want steak from anywhere else ever again. \n\nN9NE, you complete me."

It was my first visit in over 10 years and my group (of 10) was worried that this not new steakhouse lost its touch.  Thankfully, we were very wrong.\n\nWe were seated promptly, by a very sweet hostess.  Our server came by pretty quickly to hand out menus,  talk about specials, and take drink orders.  I could not believe how quickly our drinks were made and delivered.  It was a Sat. night and the restaurant was busy.  Drinks were great, strong, and nicely presented.  We ordered some apps for the table that were excellent (lobster potstickers for the win).  I got through 85% of my drink when I noticed a a crack down the side of my glass.  I showed our server just for info sake, and he quickly grabbed it and replaced it with a fresh one, on him.  \n\nSoon after we finished our apps, the entrees came.  DE-LICIOUS!! Four of us shared the tomahawk chop that was really for 2.  The sides were excellent and the service was sharp and professional.  \n\nI highly recommend for Vegas steak lovers."

I mean it was extremely ostentatious of her to say the least, if I wanted to order cake for the birthday girl I WOULD HAVE but for her to just take it upon HERSELF to do Tht was beyond awkward.

I has no problem with this as the place is very nice.  Although not what you would expect in a high end restaurant, but nice.  The waiter was ok, not what I would expect, but again I was happy.  I love bread ,and didn't care for the kind they serve there, but that was just my preference.  My wife ordered a glass of wine which she absolutely loved, and I ordered a g;ass of iced tea which was tasty.  I ordered the wedge salad to start and it was great.  My wife just picked off my salad.  I ordered the bone in ribeye which was probaly the best steak I ever ate. The sad thing here is I added crab legs for $24.00 to add to my meal,and they should put on the menu crab leg for $24.00.  I only got one crab leg and was disapointed with this item.  I ordered a baked potato for $11.00 which was good, and my wife ordered a bowl of lobster bisque soup which she loved.  So with that said I ordered a steak $54.00 a salad $12.00 oh don't forget the crab leg (and I do mean crab leg) $24.00 baked potato $11.00, Iced tea $2.00 (thats a great deal) my wife ordered lobster bisque $12.00, a glass of wine $14.00 with a total of $139.45 with tax included.  With that said the service was ok not great like you would expect in a restaurant that charges these kind of prices. My iced tea was left empty on a regular bases and the water wasn't filled on a regular bases either.  I loved my steak I must say.  We would go back, but I would just order a steak, salad, and potato, and not expect excellant service, and it would meet my expectations.  As you can see the only thing that didn't make this a 5 star was the service."

All of them were superb, expertly seasoned and a good size for 4 people to share. For dessert, even though I was way too full to eat it, we shared creme brulee and a chocolate lava cake, both primo, devoured every bite.\n  \n   The decor is sleek and chic, put not pretentious. Its the flash without the trash- tables were full of young, well mannered couples, young men burning cash and friends getting ready for a night out (late 20s to 40s). The service was excellent and the chef sent over a free appetizer, a lovely old fashioned courtesy that you rarely see, so I was pleased."

Once inside N9NE has a modern, elegant feel, it's nice and it's interesting, but it's not loud or ostentatious.   We spent a few minutes in the bar waiting for our reservation and sampling some pre-dinner cocktails, everyone enjoyed what they ordered, but the fresh dill one was the hands down favorite.\n\nOnce seated at our table our waiter and bus boy came over to introduce themselves and get the meal started.  Not long after that the sommelier stopped by to see if we needed assistance with the wine list.  Being fairly knowledgeable about wine we didn't really need help, per se, but it was fun chatting with him about their extensive list and he made a couple suggestions for wines well below the maximum price point we gave him.  I really appreciated the fact that he did not try to upsell us, both of his recommendations were spot on and that makes it much more likely that I'd trust his opinion on a future splurge bottle.\n\nThe meal itself was fantastic, most of us ordered the surf and turf, everyone's steak came out exactly as ordered and the lobster was superb as well.  Even the person who ordered pasta (I know, why would you order not a steak at a steak house???) was pleased with their choice.  The sides were tasty too, the mushrooms and asparagus were particular favorites.\n\nFor dessert we had smores, because FIRE! But novelty aside, the different flavored marshmallows were really good and it was fun to roast our own marshmallows at the table. \n\nIn summary, just go, it's well worth the quick cab ride from the strip."

The food was absolutely amazing, as were my cocktails. Our server was great.

The waiter we had was awesome but that alone will not win me over if the food was not memorable.  Sides were decent, but again, nothing that left me with the feeling that I have to come back again just to have this.  The calamari was under seasoned, the filet mignon was just ok, and the garlic green beans, lobster mashed potatoes, and the roasted mushrooms all did not satisfy my palate.  All in all, an a-ok meal.  Bottom line, when I go to restaurant like this one, with high expectations, I do expect the food to be excellent."

Since I am vegetarian these are some of the dishes worth trying. Garbage salad, the pretzel bread that is served in the bread basket w/dijon mustard, new bronzevich oysters, lobster bisque, side dishes of asparagus, mushrooms and onions. My bf had the surf n turf that he loved and my brother had the 16 oz steak that he said was the best he ever had. The bone in rib eye was shared amongst 4 people b/c it was huge and from what they said, it was to die for! Moving onto dessert! The s'mores are awesome. The presentation is one of a kind. You are served enough for 4+ people. If you love chocolate then this is for you, besides the squares of Hershey's chocolate the Graham cracker has a layer of chocolate gnache on top!! After you burn your marshmallow to a crisp ( how I like it) the chocolatey marshmallowy goodness melts in your mouth!!!"

We arrived early and spent a short amount of time in the bar while our table was being prepared which allowed for a cocktail or two.  The drinks were perfect; however, for the price they should be.  I got a dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives...intoxicating and delicious!\nFor dinner I ordered the Lobster Bisque and the Filet Mignon (medium-rare).  The waiter was a little slow on the uptake (proper silverware was not provided, bread but no bread plates, etc), but the restaurant was pretty chaotic so I cut him a break and enjoyed the company.  \nThe bisque could have been hotter but tasted very good.  I think I would go for the mac-n-cheese or lobster mashed potatoes next time though.  The steak, on the other hand, was incredible!  Probably the best steak I've ever had.  We also ordered a bottle of the Molly Dooker Boxer (Shiraz) to go along with dinner.  If you have not had to opportunity to try it, you should. Excellent wine along with steak.  Definitely a fruit bomb and high on the alcohol content, but in my opinion these are not bad things.  Also one of the most reasonable bottles on the wine list.\nWe passed on dessert since we were all relatively full and, after a quick espresso, we opted to hop the elevator to the bar at Alize, the French restaurant at the top of the Palms Hotel.  Great drinks and an incredible view of Vegas; what better way to finish off a fine meal?\nThe bill for dinner was just over $100 each.  N9ne earned four stars based on the steak alone, although no one in our group had any complaints about their meal.  Had the waiter been a little more on point, I'd have even considered 5."

            "review": "While in Las Vegas, you can't find nicer Steakhouse than N9NE. It has everything that you would expect/want in a high-end steakhouse. \n\nAs for the food, the prices and quality are right in line with what you would expect.\n\nSoups:  A very good lobster bisque and French onion.  The latter being served in a whole onion that's been hollowed out, versus a crock.  \n\nEntrees:  Steaks are in the $45-$65 range, but you get a big portion and all cuts are cooked perfectly. Based on multiple visits here, my husband has learned that basic is a better option.  Stick with a filet mignon or New York strip.  One night he went with the surf and turf, a chili-rubbed ribeye with sea bass, and all of the extras ended up hurting the overall dish. Just stick with a basic steak cooked medium rare and you'll be more than happy.  On a previous visit we had a prime rib special that was perfect. Do keep an eye out for that one.\n\nSides:  The potatoes au gratin is my favorite side dish, and it comes served in its own miniature cast-iron Dutch oven.  The baked potato is what a baked potato should be...a vehicle for lots of butter and sour cream.  Pass on the asparagus, they were limp, tasteless, and a very pale shade of green.  All of these were in the $8 range.\n\nDessert:  The chocolate mousse cake and the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e were winners.  You can pass on the bananas foster flamb\u00e9.  It's cooked tableside which is fun to watch, but it was a little over-priced for my taste. It's just a banana warmed up in some liquor.\n\nIf you're looking for something sweet to end the meal but don't want a full dessert, they serve a complimentary serving of truffles and chocolates.  They are served with dry ice, creating a cool, smokey effect.\n\nThey also serve an intermezzo before the main course, consisting of orange sorbet and champagne.  They could have brought out a gallon of the sorbet and the bottle of champagne and I would've been just as happy.  It was that good.\n\nOverall it's a great place to have a special occasion dinner in Las Vegas. I wish I could rate it higher than FIVE stars."

The food was incredible absolutely no doubt about that, but there's more to having a GREAT restaurant than just the good food, you have to have the whole package! The ambiance and actual environment of the restaurant is quite strange. It's a rather small dining room with just a very random design, it didn't quite feel like an upbeat STK like steakhouse but it definitely wasn't quiet and romantic either. \nBut my big grief here was our server, Lisa I believe her name was, she paid the absolute least amount of attention she had to to our table. Just enough to make sure that she touched our table maybe once every 15-20 minutes. We were out celebrating a birthday and I had made it known when I made the reservations that we were doing so. When we actually got to he restaurant I stopped by the hostess stand and asked if they did anything special for birthdays and the young lady confirmed that indeed they do and that she had seen my note on our reservation and she would ensure that our server was aware. I thought \"great, that's easy enough!\" The next thing I know our server is bringing us the dessert menu and asking if we want anything... She left and came back 10 minutes later, we politely declined and asked for the check. Absolutely no mention of a birthday or any special occasion. As we were leaving the same hostess girl asked how it went and I informed her that it didn't \"go\" at all... the server completely neglected to add a little something special to our special evening we were celebrating.

After being seated it took over 10 minutes for our waiter to take the drink order. Another 15 minutes to take the food order and then we waited about an hour for the entrees to come out. When my Kobe beef burger came out, the fries were cold and tasteless and the burger was dry and completely tasteless. I would have been happier with a burger from TGIFridays or Islands. At $28 (the cheapest item on their menu) it was a ripoff. My brother had the surf and turf (lobster and filet mignon). The steak was very soft, but the lobster was chewy and again both were very bland.\n\nBecause we had friends with us totaling 6 people in our group, our waiter who we hadn't seen since he dropped off our food decided to include 20% gratuity on our bill, which was laughable. He thinks because our bill came out to $500, that he is entitled to a $100 tip?  What a joke. We left a $40 tip for him and on our way to the ghost bar he comes running out after us to tell us we hadn't paid in full. When we told him the service was lousy he got mad and started to argue with us. Very professional. Definitely no need to go back here again. I would have been more satisfied going to TGIF.

We had a table of approximately 11 people and was there to celebrate a birthday.  \n\nThe bread basket had finger-sized pretzels with no salt, but had a marinara type of sauce.  The basket also came with a sugar-coated-donut-hole-like bread -- It tasted like it was a brioche-based dough.  Loved the bread!\n\nI shared the ribeye for two ($89), medium-rare, and it was cooked exactly the way \"medium-rare\" should be -- nice and bloody.  The peppercorn sauce was good, but wasn't great.  Maybe next time I'll substitute a different sauce (the restaurant has several sauces that you can add for an additional cost).  Our meat came with a side dish (sides are usually an additional cost ranging from $11 - $14), which the server allowed has to substitute for the lobster mash.  Let's just say I could've ate the mash by itself because it was yummy and really filling...it had chunks of lobster but not hoards of it, just enuff.\n\nWe brought in our own cake for the birthday boy, but the restaurant DID NOT let us slice/eat the cake at the restaurant.  They said it was a liability to have \"other\" food served on the premises.  They did not offer a free dessert for the b-day boy either.  Desserts don't cost much to make and since we ordered plenty of food already, you would think the server would comp a dessert. (He did take us all into the Ghostbar for free (yippee-do-da), but to be honest with you, I almost threw up my bloody ribeye after seeing some of the ppl in that bar.  We left after half an hour because it wasn't happening at the Ghostbar that nite).\n\nSo for 11 ppl the bill came out to approximately $1100+ including tax/tip.  I believe we each had one drink, a few appetizers, and mostly individual entrees (some ppl decided to share an entree, which seemed to workout well.  Something to consider next time...).  \n\nThe place is pretty pricey, but if you wanna try this place, maybe share an entree and side and you'll come out with a bill that's around $70ish for two ppl (without drinks)."

We started off with the soup on of the day which was a pur\u00e9ed asparagus type with shrimp on the bottom. It was delicious.\n\nFor entree, bf ordered the lamb chops. He's a steak guy but has had it before here and the waiter talked him into trying something new and went on about how great they were. I would say the waiter was right because I didn't hear one complaint. He said they were great.\nI ordered the scallop entree, it also comes with shrimp and all lays on a bed of filling risotto. It all was amazing and very filling.\nFor sides we got the gnocchi-we just aren't truffle lovers.. But if you are this dish is for you! Creamed corn- which was GREAT. Bf mentioned how great it was a few different times throughout the meal:) and also the broccoli gratin... It was also good. \nI ordered a birthday martini because I saw it on Pinterest and it wasn't very good at all. \n----------\nBUT after writing this review the GM Yassien :) came over merely 5 minutes after and apologized for the mediocre martini and replaced it with my favorite, the dirty martini. It was certainly a surprise and more than I could have ever asked for. \nIt didn't end there, they brought us a Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a chocolate happy birthday sign with a lit candle. It was SO nice!!! Not to mention AMAZING!!!! \nI left this place feeling so special and so happy. I've never met a nicer more personable staff anywhere I have ever been! :) we will definitely be back!! \n\nThanks agin Yassien for everything. \nXoxo"

I don't eat steak too often, but when I do, I like to find a really great one.  Well this was it!  I had been craving a good steak for quite some time.  Being from the LA area, I had tried 3 times and just not quite met the mark.  Taylors downtown was great but not perfect.  Mastros the same, great but not perfect.\n\nThen I went to Las Vegas and heard about N9ne.  I had been to the one that used to be in Chicago and knew it was great.  We were greeted immediately by friendly and efficient hostesses (unlike Lavo the next night).  Then we walked in and the ambiance was just great.  They had a bar and beautiful decor and a big sheer tent with a large table in the middle.  I think the UFC owner was eating in there.  The place had a great vibe for a foodie place, so I was already happy.\n\nI ordered the bone in filet which is apparently pretty hard to find.  I ordered it with the truffle egg on top because if an egg is good on a burger, then why not on a steak?  It was a good decision. It was one of the best steaks I have ever had.  Craving satisfied.  IWe also had the garbage salad and the wedge salad which were both excellent.\n\nOur waiter Jacob was very friendly and helpful.  We declined dessert and he asked if we would eat it if he just brought one and we politely declined and told him we were full but it was very thoughtful.  \n\nThis place is even better than the midwest steakhouses just because the decor is so unusual and trendy and the energy in the restaurant.  I don't go to Las Vegas often, but I am definitely going back to Nine and to the Palms.  I love the makeovers."

A little bit too dark even for a steakhouse and the interior design work doesn't work for me.  Another weird thing is that all the hosts had the exact same color of blonde hair.... hmm...\n\nON TO THE FOOD!\n\nI was NOT swayed by the steaks unfortunately, but the LOBSTER was FANTASTIC! My hubby ordered the NY steak with lobster tail and it was absolutely lovely... melted in my mouth. YUM.  My cousin, sister and I ordered the 40 oz. bone-in ribeye \"for two\" and we couldn't finish it!  I already gave the complaint that the meat wasn't hot at all, just lukewarm, but I've heard meat gets cold easily when it's pre-cut for you.  I'd rather have a hot slab of meat that I need to cut myself, thank you!\n\nI usually get the ribeye for the flavor, but ours was just whatever.  My hubby's New York steak was pretty dang bland, all you could taste was the crispy layer of salt on top.\n\nOK** IMPORTANT!** Am I one of the few people that thought the famous Lobster Mashed Potatoes were BLAH??? We didn't even finish them, and the $15 dish came in this TEENY weeny plate.  I didn't even taste any lobster, there were no chunks in them. What a waste!! For sides, just go for the creamed corn and stick to the bread. I can't believe the reviews actually said to get the lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nI think there was too much hype about this place.  The service was OK with the men in white jackets & all.... their bread was pretty good, but their steaks should make me forget about the bread!  We didn't get dessert but I got a cappuccino that was pretty good.  It ended up being pretty dang expensive.\n\nNothing terrible, but  nothing great or fantastic about their food, service or experience. Seems a bit on the snobby side... or maybe it was because we were a group of Asians.  They never seem to know what to do with us.\n\nDid NOT have:\n- the charm, warmth and history of Mastros (their lobster mashed potataoes were much better!)\n- the great experience of Flemings (when they were super nice to us even though we came in flipflops & jeans from the beach)\n- any type of specialty to their steaks, like Ruth Chris & their butter"

It really isn't my crowd, but we were staying at the hotel and my guy wanted steak, so we went ahead and made reservations. \n\nBoy, was I pleasantly surprised! From beginning to end, this was a completely wonderful experience, and everything was, while not mind-blowing, but very solid and well done.\n\nAtmosphere:\nI can see how this place could get a little loud. We arrived early because we had a show to catch, so it wasn't bad and we didn't have to shout to speak to each other. I liked that this was a nice place, but pretty casual and not at all stuffy. It was also a nice mix of clientele, couples, older business-types, bachelor/ette parties, and everyone in between.\n\nDrinks:\nWe started off with gin martinis, and they actually had blue cheese stuffed olives (noone ever has those. haha) so that was awesome. I didn't see that they had a crazy wine selection, but they do have decent choices from what they do carry. I had a fantastic Malbec that was exactly what I was in the mood for. \n\nApps: \nTheir bread basket is nice, with really delicious, rich, almost cheesy tasting butter. They also gave us a complimentary amuse of the most adorable sliders. It was kind of like pot roast on the inside, super tender. The carpaccio was great. Nothing super creative, but very well done. The lobster potstickers, while  highly recommended by the staff, were fine but not mind-blowing. I'll chalk it up to me growing up eating amazing potstickers from my mom, so potstickers don't impress me that easily. The bokchoy that the potstickers were cooked on were actually more interesting than the potstickers themselves.\n\nEntrees: \nSurf-n-Turf filet was cooked perfectly rare and well seasoned. Great texture and came with a generous lobster claw on top. My boyfriend loved it. I ordered the lamb chops. Again, perfectly medium rare, and well seasoned. While not gamey, they do taste like lamb, while I love, but not everyone might feel the same. We didn't order the sides, because while we were super intrigued by them, we knew we would have no room for them. We still had leftovers without the side dishes.\n\nService: \nThe servers and bussers were really gracious, friendly, and helpful. They actually forgot to bring my wine at first, so they comped it. I also saw that the bachelor party sitting across from us were getting complimentary shots from their server. I believe that they have the attitude of generosity here, which I appreciate.\n\nN9NE was a lot of fun and we had a great time. If we were staying at Palms again, we wouldn't hesitate to come back!"

Though we had to wait 20 minutes past our reservation time, I'm through complaining about it on peak nights, as all restaurants seem to do it nowadays.\n\nIn three words: really damn good.  Caviar appetizer: very solid, but what Visigoth doesn't like caviar?  The steaks were absolutely great and, surprisingly for Vegas, not ridiculously priced.  I pay more for a similar steak at the Met or El Gaucho in Seattle.  The sides were very good, too.  Wine list was well selected and extensive with, again, reasonable prices.  Anuhea, the sommelier (and I challenge you to find a nicer, more beautiful one at any restaurant ANYWHERE), was helpful and knowledgeable.  She's taking her Sommelier Guild diploma course this fall, so wish her luck.\n\nThe scene is pretty much the Palms....at 39, I was one of the oldest people in there, but it wasn't annoying, which many of these types of places can be.\n\nPlus, Pete Rose walked in with what looked to be a major league (I'm so funny I can't stand myself) woman of the evening.  Apparently he still can't stay away from the gambling.  Yet another reason he should stay in the Barry Bonds Memorial You Fucked Yourself Out of the Hall of Fame Club.\n\nGo to this place...it's damn good."

If prices were cut in half then MAYBE I'd give this place three stars. As it stands two is entirely fair. Even if you shit money I would recommend elsewhere. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here because he had $150 comp from gambling. He felt really uncomfortable, but he dislikes the ultra chic/pretentious elegance vibe. I was pretty indifferent to the whole layout/vibe. \n\nOur waiter was very professional and nice--although he acted like a butler rather than a friend. I'm sure that's how they train them but it's definitely not my style. I'm much more compelled to go back when the staff is warm, welcoming, and free to have personality. \n\nWe started with the rock shrimp which was dull and worth about $5 but priced around $20. It was just popcorn shrimp...there was nothing special about it although the lemon aioli sauce was nice. French onion soup is normally one of my favorite items, but at N9NE it was average quality and double the price. I have had that soup at dozens of restaurants. Given that information, I'd say about 60% of the places I've been make better french onion soup than N9NE AND at lower prices. \n\nWe are completely unimpressed so far. \n\nHe ordered the burger ($28) and I ordered the 8 oz filet ($49 I believe) and some seasonal vegetable side. The quality of my steak was good, but the sauce that came on it was gross. It tasted like licorice, which I can't stand. It must be the house sauce because I didn't order anything specific. Vegetable side=gross. And it isn't like my mom made me order vegetables because they are good for me. I love vegetables, but these ones were burnt, salty, and shitty tasting. Half of the side consisted of giant chunks of onion which were horrible and overpowering. I finished 25% of it. \n\nBest item we tried=kobe burger\n\nThe burger was solid as hell. It's the only thing we ordered that was four stars--excellent quality meat, great housemade sauces, well matched flavors, and a lovely touch with the balsalmic grilled onion. With less knowledge of Las Vegas, I would recommend this kobe slam dunk burger, BUT..............right now Smith & Wollensky's Steakhouse on the Strip is offering a $10 burger special and that burger is also amazing, but $18 cheaper...AND the staff is so awesome and friendly. \n\nThe steak had potential but was ruined by the sauce.\n\nNo reason to return. Overrated. I've been to plenty of expensive restaurants that were worth the price but this one definitely wasn't. If you have a comp like we did then it's semi worth the $30 tip. \n\nOur waiter brought us mini carrot cake cupcakes which were delicious, but that couldn't really salvage the rest of the meal."

Sadly, I'm not rich, but the EXPERIENCE was well worth our money. \n\nI ordered the 16 oz. NY Sirloin, because it was part of the \"Best of N9NE\" collection and I also thought 16 oz.' wasn't that big (I knew I should have paid more attention in math class!). I probably should have listened to all my friends and split the 16 oz. NY Sirloin with my two other girlfriends, because I caused myself some serious pain trying to finish it alone (and without success!). \n\nBy the way, take note, the steak only comes with a leaf and two tiny mushrooms stuck on its stem, everything else must be ordered separately. This really irked me, which is why I am not giving N9NE five stars. For what I'm paying, they could have AT LEAST given me a scoop of mashed potatoes or something! \n\nAnyhow, to summarize, the food (taste/quality) was excellent, I have no complaints. My girl friends seemed to really enjoy the salad, which was pretty basic and simply made, but they scarfed it all down rather quickly, so it must have been good. The $235 \"Best of N9NE\" collection seemed worthy of its price as well; the menu says it serves four, but my boyfriend, two other guy friends, and my girl friend could barely finish it!

After we studied the menu we couldn't make up our mind, so we decided to order the 44 Ounce, Pepper Crusted,Grilled Prime Ribeye Tomahawk for Two. At $165.00, it may seem at little steep, but it includes huge portions of Roasted Bone Marrow, Seasonal Vegetables (Ours were Carrots, Mushrooms, Sweet Potatoes, Onions and Asparagus), Lobster Mac & Cheese and a Red Wine Sauce. This really is a great value. If we had ordered everything separately, it would have been way more expensive.\n\nNot only is it a great deal, but everything tasted wonderful. The Flintstone sized Steak was so perfectly cooked and seasoned that it didn't really even need the Red Wine Sauce. the Bone Marrow was Rich and Decadent. the Lobster Mac and Cheese had so much of the Crustacean that it could have qualified as an entree by itself. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and offered at least a little break from the richness of the rest of our meal. The presentation of our food was so impressive that several people actually stopped by and asked us what we had ordered.\n\nWe finished everything on the platter, except for a few veggies and a little Macaroni. We did not order dessert, but the kitchen sent out a Creme Brulee' and a slice of Cheesecake for us. We were so full that we joked about exploding if we finished them, but, to our surprise, we finished them both and are still here!\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, service was superb.Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and the Sommelier matched our food and wine perfectly! If you looking for a special place to celebrate while you are in Vegas, you cannot do better than N9ne! I have said it before, but thank you to Chef Barry and the rest of the staff at N9ne for an amazing night!"

            "review": "Reservations was made for 5:30pm on Wednesday evening. Once inside the PALMS casino, followed the signs to N9NE which is hidden in the back of the casino, near the Ivory Towers and Alize. Don't miss the clear double doors with N9NE along the side wall. \nAgree with other feedback regarding the inside. It was a bit dark and when they brought over bread and put the salted butter plate in front of me, thank goodness I asked what it was! I have been told by the server that others have thought it was cheese wedges and put the entire butter slab in their mouth before realizing what it was.  \nMenu had a nice selection and very nice wine list. Ask for the Prix Fixe menu ($59, includes 2 glasses of wine) if you are interested in getting taste. With the Prix Fixe menu, I ordered the garbage salad (I know it doesn't sound appetizing but it was a crisp green salad with hearts of palm, cucumbers, onions, lettuce) with shrimp on top along with a side order of lobster bisque which contained actual lobster! I should have known Chef Dakake would use real lobster (he's from the East Coast - Providence, RI to be exact). The appetizer was paired with a fruity, aromatic CA chardonnay. Next, the main course, Delmonico Ribeye steak prepared medium (pink inside) along with grilled green asparagus (prepared crisp and not soggy) and garlic mashed potatoes. Main course paired with CA Cabernet (DR Stephens - Napa Valley) which had hints of plum and blackberries.  Delicious with the ribeye steak! Lastly, dessert consisted of flourless chocolate cake with blood orange sorbet that I couldn't finish the cake.  As a matter of fact, I couldn't even finish my main course.\nOverall, I was impressed with the impeccable service by Michael and even Chef Dakake came out to greet the patrons! It was a pleasure to meet him and compliment him on a delicious meal! I read some of the other feedback and I can see how the restaurant can get busier towards the rush of dinner time. Overall, I would go back and well worth the trip off the Strip."

Every single item he prepared was delicious, from the popcorn shrimp to the banana cream pie (with oreo cookie crust!).  \n\nThis was my second time at N9NE, but this meal truly blew my mind.   I was completely gushing after this meal.  Chef Barry created a tasting menu for us off the regular menu.  We started with a chilled seafood plate with a lobster claw, a peeled shrimp, a crab leg and an oyster -- so fresh and so delectable.  We shared a sashimi plate and the popcorn shrimp -- amazingly tasty.  Loved the garbage salad and the french onion soup.   But the main courses are why this place deserves 5 plus stars --- the filet mignon was maybe the best steak I've ever had -- it was perfectly cooked and seasoned and just melted in my mouth like butter.  Simply A-MAZ-ING -- so amazing that my vegetarian friend ate 2 pieces!!  Seriously.  The scallops were to die for and even the salmon (which you'd think would not be so interesting) was incredible -- really tasty with an asian/miso type marinade.  SO GOOD!\n\nThe new york strip was fabulous, as were the lobster mashed potatoes, creamed corn and even the fries.  For dessert, we had the aforementioned banana cream pie on an oreo cookie crust and this moist carrot cake.  Simply divine.  I'm gushing even now.\n\nI really don't think I can eat anywhere else after this."

Let me just say this is hands down-- if not the BEST steak I've ever had at a restaurant-- it is in the TOP 2 (along with Mozza Osteria in LA).  The cut, the dry age tenderness, the seasoning and the absolutely PERFECT cooking of the steak is just unbelievable (medium rare, it's the only way).  I added a lobster tail on the side because I was ballin' (in my mind, and because my tax refund check just came).  Even the house cabernet wine was legit.  I'm generally pretty cheap and have scraped up my ass with low cost toilet paper thinking \"I'm winning\" but in this case I was happy to hand these mofos $250 PLUS tip for the meal my wife and I had at N9ne.

I'd recommend making reservations. \n\nAtmosphere is one that a lot of restaurants don't have. It's almost a mix of fine dining with a club type environment. The food is impeccable, but you can't go there expecting the same atmosphere you would get at other steakhouses such as Lawry's. Instead, it's almost like walking into a club. Music blaring and people having fun.\n\nService was also spot on. They were very attentive to our needs, without being over bearing. Some restaurants tend to over do their service, bothering you every five minutes or so. At N9NE, I never had to ask for anything, they just seemed to magically know I would need it - without having to check on us every five minutes.\n\nThey have a very extensive wine list, and our server was very knowledgeable and helpful in picking out wines that we would like. I'd recommend getting the bone in rib eye. I don't think I've ever had a steak that great. I don't even know how to explain it - except that it was effin delicious. \n\nSo, next time you have money to spare and you want a great steak - definitely go to N9NE."

This would have been five stars if it wasn't for the rubbery taste of my lobster tail.  Came on a Wednesday night around 6:00 PM and the place was dead up until about 7:00 PM, then it got crazy.  So crazy it was nearly possible to think.\n\nThis is the main reason I docked one star, because I hate restaurants so loud I can't hear myself think.  My appetizer was awesome!  However, an addictive habit to quality seafood can get expensive at $99 a plate for the medium shellfish platter.  All of the portions and presentation were five stars in my book.  I couldn't believe how large my shrimp were!  See pictures I took!  Cocktail sauce was good and not overly spicy with horse radish.  Definitely would order again if my budget permits.\n\nI ordered Surf and Turf for $65 and I must say my steak was cooked exceptionally well.  It gave Ruth Chris a nice run for there money, but a nice seasoned steak that cut very easy.  My only downside was this white drizzle sauce that was especially topped on my lobster, that made it taste rubbery...almost as if it was reheated.  I still ate it, because I was hungry, but next time I would suggest no white sauce.   I really don't know what the hell it was.\n\nOverall, nice restaurant but if you're coming for privacy and good conversation you won't find it here.  Good food, expensive, but on the upside you won't find rift raft here!"

Went with a party of 5, where 3 of us got the prix fixe meal for $65 which including unlimited wine(chard and/or cab) and it was outstanding, Chef's app were salmon croquettes and were mouthwatering delicious. The first course was french onion soup with their signature garbage salad which were exactly the right portion size and a great start. Followed by about a 3 ounce app choice of salmon or halibut, got the halibut and it was buttery soft and grilled to perfection. A 10 ounce ribeye was the main entree and again, grilled to  perfection and tasty throughout. Sides of green beans and mashed with a gruyere bubbly crust were tantalizingly good. Our other members got the 40 ounce ribeye to split and it was EXCEPTIONAL. They also got the lobster mac and cheese and lobster pot stickers. We ended up with a choice of choco banana cream pie or strawberry shortcake for the ending of the prix fix which were both delicious. But the s'mores we ordered were the star dessert... yummy and fun!\n\nI would have given it a 5 except for the service. It was good, but not the caliber of the of an exceptional steakhouse. The server indicated when we first ordered that the chef  preferred to have everyone in the party order the prix fix and she would have to check to see if he would allow us to order it and order off the menu as well. The last thing I want when the bill ends up being $600 is the chef telling us what we can and cannot order. Not enough check-ins from the wait staff and as they were clearing our table, they were adding another table to ours and setting it for the incoming party, which was uncomfortable as we were still drinking out coffee."

I didn't drink and so I didn't get the most out of it, but my two dinner mates did. They drank and I ate. It was all very exciting. Here's what I had on their menu: \n\nOnion Soup and Garbage Salad - The onion soup was on the saltier end and I would have preferred with less sodium. The garbage salad was a nice pairing to the soup. They really should name that salad better though. It was light and surprisingly contained shrimp. Score!\n\nAtlantic Salmon - This was delicious. Seared perfectly and salted evenly. Outside had a crunchy texture. Enjoyed thoroughly. Tasted a bit of their striped seabass and it wasn't as tasty. I recommend the salmon. \n\nPrime Ribeye steak - Hello yumminess. Ordered medium rare and was not disappointed. My bf, however, said it was too salty for him and didn't finish over half the steak. \n\nChocolate Banana Creme Pie - this was amazing. I really loved the softness of the creme and how well it meshed with everything. \n\nStrawberry Shortcake - not my favorite dessert in general so I can't be unbiased on this. \n\nOur waitress was friendly and very entertaining. I personally loved her. She made our night more eventful in terms of her wittiness. She brought out a specialty shooter and the guys loved it.

It was so mouthwateringly good that I polished off the whole thing.\nSides: Cream of corn is a win and the mushrooms with caramelized onions had an awesome flavor. Not bland like what I imagined saut\u00e9ed mushrooms would taste like.\nDesserts was a tray of mini samplings of cheesecake bites, carrot cupcake, and what appeared to be a peanut butter cup. Let's just say I had one of eat and I wish there was more on the plate. \nOverall great atmosphere. Has a modern hip feel. I would return to try their other dishes"

They were able to accommodate us in a private room which was perfect.  The whole experience was great...the food, the service.  All of our guests were pleased and left with full stomachs!  My 2 favorite dishes are the salmon and the surf and turf (filet mignon and lobster tail).  Don't miss out on the lobster mashed potatoes!  I'm always too full by the time dessert comes around, so I've never tried any.  This is literally the only place that I love enough to leave the Strip to come eat at.

And this is just a personal thing, but I don't like my steaks pre-cut; I like cutting them myself. It completes the steak experience, if that makes any sense.\n\nThe lobster mashed potatoes, though good, didn't meet the hype. In fact, I thought the mushroom mashed potatoes that came w/ our steak was better.\n\nThe creamed corn was good but not up to par w/ the one at Lawry's.\n\nI liked the creamed spinach w/ the melted cheese on top as well the asparagus.\n\nThe overall taste of the food was more on the salty side as I found myself constantly needing to rehydrate, but that brings me to the next point: the service here was immaculate. Very professional, attentive and hard-working. Made for an enjoyable meal."

Steaks are obviously all decent, although not the best we've had.  I would give the food 3.5 stars, decent but not sure if it worth the money.  \n\nBiggest disappointment was in the attitudes of the 5 hostesses when you first walk in.  If they are trained to be curt and unpleasant, kudos - then they deserve a raise.  We arrived early for our reservation and ended up getting seated right away, but we walked past numerous empty tables for 2 and got seated at a table that had been squeezed in between two large parties.  We have no issues with communal dining, but don't seat people at a cramped table when the entire restaurant is fairly open.  Most of the other tables remained open while we were there, so it's clear they weren't reserved.  The attitude of our server wasn't much better - all of the waitstaff we interacted with were fairly sterile.  2 stars for the staff.\n\nIn a city with an endless choice of great options, I'd avoid this.  Definitely not worth the trip if you aren't staying at the Palms."

This restaurant has everything from phenomenal food and massive wine selection, to impeccable service and a swanky, romantic atmosphere. \n\nThe hosts paid attention to the reservation notes, ensuring that the chef was notified of my partner's tomato allergy. The server, Robert, was a well-seasoned veteran of the industry, and not only was able to course together a meal for us - which we thoroughly enjoyed - and made it fun in the process. \n\nThere were a few things that stood out with Robert, making him one of the best servers that I've had in Vegas. Firstly, his attention to detail was on point. He noticed that the server assistant brought out the normal bread selection, which had a focaccia-type bread with tomato sauce on it, and made him take it back and bring out non-cross contaminated bread to the table. Next, he clued in on the fact that we were having a date night, and made it just a little extra special, making sure to spend a little extra time getting to know us and surprising us with dishes that he selected for us. He was very playful, completely respectful, and extremely gracious. \n\nWe started off with Kumamoto (CA) and Blue Point (NY) oysters, gigantic large shrimp and an order of delicious Short Rib Ravioli - which were complimentary, thanks to our trusty Yelp check-in. He paired it with one of my favorite Sauvignon Blancs, Brancott, from Australia. Our main course was equally spectacular. I had a 22oz bone-in Ribeye steak, seasoned to perfection, and cooked to a true medium, which was paired with a delicious Cabernet Sauvignon from Alexander Valley. \n\nWe were sad that we didn't save any room for dessert, because everything on the menu looked amazing. \n\nA+.

If you are stranded at the Palms, you can go and get the steak  and be happy (the fries smelt good at other tables, but I didn't have them). \n\nOverall I felt like I was not treated like someone who would be spending a lot because it was mostly older men in the restaurant. I was traveling for business. Maybe it didn't help that I inquired about the pre fix meal (it was at 6:30, not busy, and I would have expected all menus to be presented since it is highlighted on the website and a coworker recommended it). Anyways, I asked just to look at the pre-fix menu (don't offer it on the site if you discourage it in person), and the waiter reluctantly and very quickly just said what was on it. I wasn't allowed to see the menu itself to compare if I would like the offerings but I heard steak and thought that would be good. I went to order it, and my coworker was going to get a filet from the regular menu with other things, but I was told both of us have to do pre-fix. This makes no sense. A pre-fix menu usually lets people have a tasting, if they don't want to stuff themselves silly. I expect pre-fix to be smaller portions to enable someone to try many things. If my coworker wanted to get a soup, salad, and $60 steak, why couldn't they? \n\nMost of the food was disappointing. The bread was not good, not fresh, bland. \n\nI had 3 other beet salads that week in Vegas (I am a beet salad connoisseur) but couldn't be finished because it was drowning in dressing. Every piece of lettuce looked like it was dipped in oil and there were barely any beets. The buffalo chicken wontons seemed like they were frozen food but were good. \n\nThe filet was delicious. Very, very good. Cooked perfectly. The sauce wasn't very good though. I would have expected one sauce to be included if it wasn't exceptional tasting.\n\nI spent about $175 for two people, which is fine, but would have liked better service for that price. It was my most expensive meal of the week, and the worse."

N9ne definitely exceeded my expectations as I'd heard it's known more as a place to see and be seen, than for it's food.\n\nI had the wedge salad with the balsamic dressing rather than the ranch to start and it was easily the best salad dressing I've ever had in my life.  For my meal I had the filet mignon. It was delicious! Cooked perfectly, tender and a very tasty glaze on it.  I'm not a drinker, so I can't tell you about that aspect.\n\nThe prices weren't as bad as I originally anticipated either and N9ne is easily one of the more reasonable upscale restaurants price wise in Vegas.  I'm a local, so I've been to many of the well known Vegas restaurants and this is definitely one of my favorites, I will be back.\n\nThe atmosphere was very trendy, in a weird way reminded me of a Virgin America flight.  Dim lighting with a purple tint.  Tables far enough away from each other that I didn't feel like I was eating with strangers.  Service was also excellent, from the hostess that greeted us all the way to the bus boy.\n\nThe missing star is because it's loud in there.  The music is better suited for a club than an intimate dinner.

They have a strict policy for group's over 10, you have to sign a contract and put a credit card down to hold the reservation. Didn't experience this with any of the other restaurants I made reservations with and thought it was a bit too stringet with the policy of charging $25 per person if someone in your party is a no-show. Thankfully, we all made it there..on time (a big deal since we were running late for everything all weekend)!!!\n\nThe staff was friendly upon our arrival and the service good for such a large group. They serve bread baskets that contained a variety of rolls and breadsticks (I remember a pretzel roll and some type of cheesy spicy breadstick) all were tasty. We all received a small salad before the entree. It was delicious and included the best piece of bacon any of us have ever had. No joke!  I ordered the scallops ($44) as an entree. It included three jumbo scallops, a scattering of shrimp, and some potato hash in a delicious cream sauce. I loved my meal! Only wish more came on the plate! Sides cost extra, so I vetoed that. Looking back, wish I had gotten something to accompany the scallops. Tried my BFF's shrimp alfredo, was yummy! The portion seemed really small, but everyone that got the pasta said it was just right and filling.\n\nI would recommend this place to people who don't mind splurging for dinner (don't go if you are on a budget!). I think the prices are steep for the amount of food you alctually receive. I wouldn't feel a need to go back while visiting again, which is why I give it a 3."

I swore by SW @ Wynn, but my friend staying @ Palms Place really liked N9NE.  He works as a butcher, so he knows his meats, so his recommendation carries a lot of weight.  \n\nOur dinner reservation was around 6:30 pm on a Tuesday.  When we walked in, we really didn't need one because it was dead, although it did get really packed as we left.  But since we were like 1 of 5 tables there, our food was served quickly and service was incredible.\n\nI started off with a Moscow Mule.  Lately, it's been my new go to drink and most places I've been to (unless they promote it as a specialty) don't do it right.  N9NE did it right...they used actual ginger beer.  They even used a copper cup.\n\nWe started with the calamari and WOW.  I don't think i've actually ever had fresh fried calamari before...it was always frozen.  This was definitely fresh....you could tell the difference.  It didn't have any rubbery texture to it.  Perfectly cooked, I couldn't stop munching on these.\n\nThe complimentary bread was a variety of different kinds of breads...pretzel rolls, focaccia (SP?), and some crispy flatbreads.  All tasty and moist...none of it was dried out.  \n\nI ordered Barry's Special, which was a prime rib w/shisito peppers and pearl onions in au jus.  I had it cooked medium rare and it came out exactly how I requested.  The peppers and onions gave it a little bit of zest, but not to the point where you couldn't taste the beef.  The peppers and onions themselves were also amazing with the beef and I ate everything on that plate.\n\nFor sides, we had ordered some gnocchi and creamed spinach.  The spinach came out melted with cheese all over it and the gnocchi was definitely made differently than what I'm used to.  The gnocchi almost looked like chinese rice rolls they serve at dim sum (cheung fan), sitting in a small layer of a cheesy cream parmesan sauce.  \n\nThe gnocchi was fantastic...it was seared on the top and bottom and it gave it a small crunch (not too crunchy, think of when they make a grilled burrito at taco bell...that level of sear) that enhanced the flavor.  It wasn't as thick as most gnocchi is...it was definitely more delicate but I like this twist on gnocchi as it didn't have that floury taste that gnocchi sometimes has.\n\nThe spinach was the only disappointment of the night....way too salty.  \n\nBetween 3 people, our check total was about $200 (including drinks)....not bad for a quality steakhouse.  \n\nPics:  \nhttp://instagram.com/p/etHfSSAjhl/ Barry's special with the gnocchi in the background.\nhttp://instagram.com/p/etHOQgAjhU/  Kobe style beef burger with homemade fries.  The fries were definitely made there, not frozen, and cooked in peanut oil.  I love the way they even stacked them up....I don't see many places that make a presentation out of fries.\nhttp://instagram.com/p/etHIBKAjhL/  Kobe style meatloaf with a fried egg on top.  This one was definitely unique....a little salty I felt though.\nhttp://instagram.com/p/etHsgqgjh3/  The gnocchi.  Sorry for the crappy blurry shot.\n\nAside from the one blunder of creamed spinach, everything here was excellent.  The service, the food, the drinks, and it wasn't outrageously expensive compared to other steakhouses I've been (like BOA) for what you get."

For a moment, there is peace on earth and meaning in life.\n\nThat is what eating steak and prime rib at N9NE is like. \n\nThey also have great side dishes, including gnocchi (I think E Jay pretty much says what I was thinking), mashed potatoes with lobster (only the BEST MASHED POTATOES YOU'VE EVER EATEN), and salad. I recommend their sashimi and rock shrimp appetizers. The dessert was also amazing - chocolate pre-smeared on graham crackers with a small fire for you to roast your marshmallow.

My lobster mashed potatoes were tasty, but not as rich as my girlfriend's creamed corn... mmmm.\n\nIf I could change anything about N9NE, it would be to remove the shoulder pads from their servers' white sportcoat/jacket uniforms and shorten their length. \n\nIt was kind of disorienting to see all these Don Johnson/Miami Vice jackets walking around serving us..."

I had the 35 day dry aged bone in ribeye. It was chewy, fatty and not very flavorful.  There was an overpowering rosemary flavor.  While I enjoy the herb it was a flavor mismatch, in my opinion.  The steak was over cooked slightly but I dealt with it. \n\nEarlier in the week, I ate at Stripsteak in Mandalay Bay and for $5 more, I had a American Wagyu ribeye cap that ranks in my top three steaks of all time.  Plus they give you duck fat fries. \n\nSkip this pedestrian steakhouse and go directly to Stripsteak."

Seafood: Oyster & caviar = Refreshing,  Prawn & Crab leg = some healthy meat on these guys.\n\n2. Kobe burger: I have to admit that I do not like fresh cut fries until I came to N9ne. They always soak up too much oil and tend to come out tan brown.  So generally, I like the pre-made fries that are fried (i.e. Fatburger fat fries and the like).  However, the brick-like gangster fries that accompany the Kobe burger are stupendous. They come out piping hot, so let them sit for a minute. The portion is deceptively generous. (Even to the trained eye with an appetite, it looked as if it could have been conquered. Not even close.) This burger is so rich that it gets gender specific because it's hard to go through it alone - if you are a girl. I must note that this delicious burger was so rich, it was hard for me to digest. But that's purely a personal hiccup because I don't eat meat often so it's always hard for me to digest beef.\n\n3. Killing Me Sweetly.  You got it  - time for Desserts.\nTried the whole dessert menu. So, out comes a marble slab as long as a coffee table with every dessert that is offered at the restaurant. The pix do not give it justice of how massive the dessert sampler is. Because of this, my party closed down the place far past the closing hour. \n\nAfter the intial shock & intial purring, immediately, universal mind control took hold. I knew I liked it and all of them were calling my name. I loved all the desserts and so to break down each and every dessert would probably make this review my longest one ever.  Since all the desserts were sinfully seducing, it's safe to order any dessert here and walk away happy. \n\nHowever, something worth mentioning is the colossal carrot cake. I love carrot cake.  But through the years, I've come across many a carrot cakes suffocating in cinnamon & nutmeg.  To the point where I stopped selecting carrot cake as a dessert option. Then, I come here and eat my favorite carrot cake to date. Now, to the masses who have become used to the heavy cinnamoned & overpowered nutmegged out carrot cakes, this carrot cake might taste too mild for you. Honestly, this is how a perfect carrot cake should taste. \n\n4. Drinks are on par. \n\nAMBIANCE: Love the blue lighting and the restaurant layout.  Very spacious with high ceilings and even though the place was filled to capacity, I didn't get that crowded feeling. Mix of LA vibe, Sex & the City night out, & a touch of Vegas.  Plus, Kid Rock & entourage and one of Russell Simmons guy was there. Whoooooooo's house? Run's house. (Run DMC wasn't there though. Whaddaya gonna do!)\n\nPeep the pix.\n\nParking = self (free) & valet parking. Own lot. \n\nLocation = in the corner. To the right of the line that forms for the bottom entrance of Ghost Bar. \n\n(4.5 stars, rounded up for good measure.)"

We had our own atmosphere and our own crowd that night.\n\nHowever, the food was fantastic. Seafood platters were fresh, delicious, and very generous for our party of 40+. And there's really only one thing to talk about: the rib-eye, medium rare. One of the best steaks I've ever had. Absolutely incredible.\n\nI tried to order a Spanish Rioja, but the server emphatically, passionately suggested that I try a different Spanish red called Clio from Jumilla instead. It was stunningly good. My date and I, along with a couple friends, finished 4 bottles of it. We were also given some great icewine with dessert.\n\nAwesome meal, but honestly you just need to get a rib-eye. The instant you taste it, you won't care about anything else."

We splurged a bit and had ourselves a feast. Service is pretty relaxed, staff is not what you'd expect from a fine dining establishment, but they were attentive and apologetic when our server spilled water all over the table.\n \nOur feast began with carpaccio, lobster pot stickers and avocado fries. The carpaccio was luscious and unique because it was served with a quail egg in a steak tartare nest. It was delicious. The lobster pot stickers were pillows filled with yummy Asian flavors and lobster, of course. Tasty bites for sure. The avocado fries were crisp, but not greasy. They were served with a cool chipotle lime dipping sauce. Decadent and savory. \n\nMoving on the entrees, we ordered the Colorado Lamb, 22 oz Porterhouse and the 16 oz bone in filet. We shared sides of asparagus, potato gnocchi and hot potatoes.\n \nThe sides were all delicious. I often find asparagus is cooked to mush, but these stalks had bite and were cooked to perfection. The gnocchi was bathed in a truffle cream sauce. There were no complaints there, but it was the hot potatoes that were sinful. Au gratin swimming in aged cheddar and jalapenos. I'd return for these potatoes alone. \n\nThe steaks were beautifully prepared, tender and scrumptious, but it was the lamb chops that were stellar. We've had delectable lamb chops elsewhere... Circo, Delmonico, and Aureole come to mind, but these were fantastic. Tender, juicy and presented with a beautiful crust made from parmesan and pine nuts. Mild flavors to enhance the lamb rather than mask it. Sink your teeth into these. You won't regret it. \n\nI couldn't possibly indulge in another bite so I skipped dessert, but the guys each had a red velvet cupcake. The cake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was not too sweet. A perfect end to an exceptional meal. \n\nIt was easy to see what N9NE has been doing right all these years. Solid eats. Hip environment. No complaints."

The scene was trendy and we sat next to a NBA basketball player (we didn't know which one because neither one of us could see him and we didn't want to be rude and stare).  \n\nThe service was decent, a bit slow, but it was also a very busy evening.  The delicious food makes up for the slow service- it was also enjoyable to have a leisurely dinner.  The scotch my fiance ordered was forgotten (either by the bartender or the waiter) but when the waiter realized he hadn't received it, received a double on the house (it was more than a double, the entire glass was filled).  \n\nGreat food and a fabulous experience."

Though I thought Nine was certainly above average, I didn't think it was worth the money.\n\nThe weird thing about their steak is that they serve it drenched in au jus.  They must have dead bovine mutliple personality disorder and can't really decide whether they're serving steak or prime rib.  While I can certainly appreciate a restaurant trying new combinations of things,  I don't think a restaurant that bills itself as a top notch steakhouse should deviate from a classic, simple steak seasoned only with salt, maybe pepper, and sauces (if any) served only on the side.  And the only case where this rule should be broken is if the combination is exceptional.  In this case, the combination is just plain weird.   \n\nIn addition, the steak lacked any kind of discernable char.  The steaks were also very thin.  Not quite Denny's thin, but close.  \n\nAll of the above were the case for my steak (the porterhouse)  and my friend's (the ribeye).\n\nThe Garbage Salad, however, was pretty good.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and want a good steak, go to the SW.  I went there the night after Nine and again confirmed that the SW really is that good."

He took the plates but then walked over to another tables and stacked a plate on top of them. I wasn't sure if he just wasn't very good at his job or if he didn't bother to fulfill my request. \n\nBut by the time the bill came it was obvious he had ignored my request/not even bothered to ask me if I'd wanted my leftovers packed up to go. \n\nI am deeply disappointed in my experience as I had half of my meal left and it was not a cheap dinner. \n \nAfter my first experience at N9NE Steakhouse a few months ago and the Yelp reviews I was surprised by my mediocre experience at this restaurant.

Really worth the price!\nWe were having a wonderful time on appetizers and cocktails and when my steak came very well-done (I ordered medium), I just had to send it back.  I could not spend $55 on a steak that I could not chew... N9ne handled it sooo well!  They took my steak away, brought me a complimentary shrimp cocktail (delicous by the way) and a new steak + a reorder of the sides that my friends had already attacked.  That is first class and I will always make it a point to visit N9ne on all my trips to Vegas."

Yes, it's pricey (as others have mentioned), but hey, it's Las Vegas... so is everything else! \n\nWe started with the Stuffed Mushrooms - nine plump mushrooms stuffed with Alaskan King Crab, and covered in cheese. Delicious!! I also had a Caesar salad (with anchovies), which I described to the others I was with as the best Caesar salad I've ever eaten. For the main course, I chose the 24 ounce bone-in rib-eye. PERFECTION!  I've eaten at a number of the \"high end\" steakhouses (Ruth's Chris, Smith & Wollensky, etc), and N9NE served me the best steak I've ever eaten. Exactly as a steak should be. My wife had the scallops (I know, I know... but she wasn't feeling a steak). Her scallops were perfectly cooked, and wonderful as well. She and I split a loaded baked potato. If I'm being picky (and I have to be to find something wrong with the place) the potato was a bit overcooked... but again, I'm being picky. \n\nWhether or not the ambiance of the place is to your liking is a personal decision, but we loved it. We found it fun and typical of \"over-the-top\" Las Vegas! Our waiter was very prompt and attentive, and his recommendation of the rib-eye was spot on! He was fun, and when my wife and her friend just mentioned off-hand that they were celebrating their birthdays, he brought two Red Velvet cupcakes with candles for dessert. A little cheesy for such an upscale restaurant? Probably, but I really appreciated the gesture. \n\nMy advice? GO! You'll enjoy the experience!"

Being so long since I last been, I will get to the point.  At the time, the theme of the restaurant was very modern and hip.  Ordered the rib-eye, medium rare, and it was good.  The flavoring was where it needed to be and the size was just perfect.  Not only was this my first steak house experience, but my first pure black coffee experience.  What I mean by pure black, I mean nothing added.  The taste of that coffee, was nothing like I've ever had.  By all means I'm not a big coffee guy, and just a couple of sips of coffee has me wide awake.  But this one, I finished and always tell my friends and remember."

It was lovely, but I like to try new things! We had lovely martinis although I forget what they were exactly! \n\nHusband and I both went for the surf and turf and the potato gnocci on the side. The steak was soooooo tender and the accompanying sauces matched the lobster and steak so well. The gnocci was beautiful but it was all quite rich by the time we'd finished our meals. \n\nOn to dessert and really you can only have s'mores here and they were the most fun dessert I have ever had.

When you step in you definitely realize the trendiness of the establishment and you can definitely picture celebrities being here. \n\nThe prices were high but that's what you would expect eating at a trendy place, and so I expect the food to be impressive. Well, the food arrived and surprisingly, it was GREAT. The fillet and the lobster over the bed of lobster mash potatoe was BOMB! I've never had a juicy, cooked to perfection, piece of steak ever before like this and I was craving for more. Haha for some reason though, my steak was smaller compared to my party which made me a little jealous. The lobster mash potatoe was delicious as well with succulent pieces of lobster and creamy and tasty mash potatoes! I would love to come back...when I'm a BALLAR!\n\nAs far as service goes, the waiter's assistant tipped over my glass of water...which kind of ruined my enjoyment of the restaurant.

And the three types of bread were delicious. We enjoyed it all. The filet was cooked perfectly. The 22 oz porterhouse was a treat. I prefer my steak bone-in. And with this cut, it's like having three different 5 or 6 oz steaks. The closer you cut into the meat near the bone...let me stop. I can't. We also ordered their lobster mashed potatoes. That's right. Steak and potatoes with a twist of surf. Guaranteed to win. If is was so great, why only four stars?\n\nIf the hostesses weren't so damn rude about seating us when we arrived at our reservation time, they would have earned the solid five. I ask the question, \"what's the point in having a reservation, if I have to wait to be seated, and there are vacant tables staring at us?\" Perplexed and annoyed, they gave in to my interrogation tactics. It really should not have come to that. Let's be nice to the customers. They are our friends. They have money to give.\n\nOur server Lisa was great. She comped our drinks to make up for the mishap with the hostesses. During the rest of the meal, she made us feel comfortable and welcome. We never had to ask for water refills, she was ready to try and fatten us up with desert. She was on point. I hope she doesn't have to share her tip."

            "review": "As a good friend & I entered the N9ne corridor, Pat Sajak hurriedly sauntered past us as if Vanna White was in an upstairs suite waiting for him; interesting start to the night.   A stunning hostess asked if we wanted a table because we could be seated right away.  We thought it would be busy and planned to eat at the bar. Thankfully we stuck to that plan.\n\nThe meal started with a pair of appetizers: Ahi Tuna Tartare & fried Rock Shrimp.  The delicious shrimp had a light breading that added texture that did not overpower the shrimp.  The assorted dipping sauces were very good but the shrimp could stand alone on its own.  I had less of a liking to the tuna tartare.   What I did not like was the tuna appeared smashed so much that you could not tell if it was indeed tuna being served.  Perhaps I was expecting a presentation of \"ahi-poke\" cubes of tuna where the freshness of meat could be seen and appreciated.  To me it seems that if the tuna is smashed beyond the point of being unrecognized, it's just a way of masking the quality & freshness of the fish.\n\nDespite the very small disdain I had for the tuna tartar, it did not make me less excited for my main dish; the 28 oz bone in Prime-Rib.  Dear Fellow-Yelpers, let me tell you: it was FANTASTIC!  What was put in front of me was a \"Brontosaurus rib-meat\" that only Fred Flintstone could appreciate; it was intimidatingly large.  I could see the perfect reddish-pink of medium-rare that was under au jus poured on the prime-rib.  Upon the first slice, I realized that I could have used a straw to cut into the very tender meat.  The first bite was so breathe taking that I truly did pause and almost cried.  Our server saw this and asked if I was okay, but I held up my index finger as if to say \"give me a moment while I appreciate all that is good in the world.\"  She smiled and left me alone to enjoy the rest of my bite.\n\nNeedless to say, I savored every bite that could muster of my prime rib.  The au jus is a bit different than most I have experienced in that it contains more of an \"herb\" flavor than salty.  That was fine by me because it complemented the already salted outer crust of the meat.  The fat content in the meat was perfect; not too much but just enough to keep the flavor and juiciness intact.  My only regret was that I was unable to finish my Bronto-rib and had to sheepishly ask for a to-go box.  My \"swag\" took a hit and I had to turn in my \"man-card\" for such an offense of not being able to consume such an excellent piece of prime-rib.\n\nDespite the meal, what really made me give my 5 star rating of N9ne was the service.  Jasmin from Lanai, you are a Superstar!!   As we sat at the bar through the entire meal, my friend and I attentively watched Jasmin's hair flip over her shoulders with each sexy head twirl.  Yes, it is relatively easy for two cocktail infused men to observe a beautiful woman do anything but this was completely different.  Working alongside Jasmin was the spiky haired, broad shouldered, Latin accented Roberto.  What I saw was teamwork personified.  \n\nRoberto & Jasmin worked behind the bar like a fine tuned machine.  Need a bottle that was out of reach?  Roberto was there reaching upward for Jasmin.  Need to replace an emptying bottle of vodka?  Jasmin was there full bottle in hand for Roberto as he poured the bottle's last drop.  I watched Roberto quickly make a 16 shot order for a large dinner party. Jasmin was there handing each possible ingredient as he poured them into the drink shaker.  Now there wasn't any bottle twirling, tossing, or singing \"The Hippy-Hippy Shake\" while this teamwork was happening but it was a pleasant side show to appreciate.  Done with laughs & playful bickering like a happy married couple, Roberto & Jasmin worked together perfectly all night.  When there is genuine laughter & joy in the workplace, it can only reflect positively in the product which is served to the customers.\n\nShould you dine at N9ne and have an opportunity to eat at the bar, please do so.  Jasmin & Roberto will do little things like constantly replace your cocktail napkin under your drink just because it got soggy from condensation.  It shows the amount of pride they have to keep their work area clean & presentable to the customer.  This can only translate in being attentively served & making sure you receive the best possible dining experience; isn't that what we all should want?\n\nAnd should you dine at the bar, if your cellular phone needs a a charging, Jasmin will gladly unplug a work device behind the counter and use one of her needed outlets to bring your very important phone to full power.  Need to order a drink or a refill?  Make sure you snap your fingers multiple times in the air for all at the bar to see & yell out \"HEY, CUTIE!\", Jasmin LOVES that and will make sure you are served first and without disdain.\n\nThank you very much to the entire staff at N9ne for making my visit a most memorable one; a return is imminent."

It is cooked perfectly and melts in your mouth.\n\nThe tomahawk ribeye is a beast at a whopping 44 ounces but they treat it right and it is cooked and seasoned perfectly. \n\nAll of their steaks are USDA Prime and they are aged in house. \n\nThe sides are another great treat here. The truffle cream gnocchi is my favorite side dish anywhere. They melt in your mouth and have the most amazing balance of flavors. \n\nThe hot potatoes au gratin are another treat. Pair these with the fire chicken and thank me later.\n\nCocktails here are always made perfect and with high quality spirits. They do an excellent job with wine pairing as well.\n\nThe chefs gifts are creations that sometimes end up on the menu and are always fun to try.\n\nThe desserts are always delightful. You can never go wrong with their table side s'mores. The presentation kicks up an already fun treat.\n\nYou're inclined to see stars here on any given night. I've seen Derek Jeter, Robin Leach, Vince Neil, DJ Pauly D, Playmates galore, several UFC fighters, and more here.\n\nIt can be a little loud but it's a fun and vibrant place."

First a winning hit at the roulette table followed by 40oz bone-in.  And the steak was delicious too.\n\nBut seriously folks.  Gorgeous lighting.  Fabulous wine.  And the waitress folded our napkins everytime we got up to go to the bathroom (hey Di, I know there was a t.v. in the bathroom, but jeesus woman--come back!)  \nThey start you out with a basket 'o fun here so play cool because those hot prezels will get you and before you know it you've had too many glasses of the pink stuff and withtthe hot mustard stuff your first entree will be a distant memory.  Also, if you are a waitress there and some girl named Amy orders wine--please make sure you pour ALL of the wine into the decanter because she will flag you down. Good thing there was a man in purple spandex and a pimp hat on next to us or that would have been really embarassing.\n\nLast but not least is the \"dress code\" that goes on in this joint.  Besides all of the costuming going on here there was also this underground knowledge that if you are of the male gender you must be in jeans and a white pinned stripe shirt or you are nothing.  I'm really asking this question:  guys, is this a thing? or has sean john forwarded an email that his staff has gone on vacation?  It was the scariest thing I have ever seen. Let your damn girlfriends pack for you even if you are on an all-guys trip!\n\nLoving the n9ne.  Viva la Pimps 'N Ho's!!!"

There were only 9 of us and we went on a Wednesday night, and it was my first time.\n\nFirst off, great ambience, and the staff was quite friendly.  Our service was good, and the food was excellent.  I indulged in their sashimi appetizer, which was fresh and quite tasty; definitely a great start.  Instead of the steak (I know, I know lol) I opted for a Kobe burger cooked medium rare, and I couldn't be happier (wish I could've finished it but at least I got to take the rest home ;P).  I sampled a few other things also off of everyone else's plate, such as the potato leek soup, and potato gnocchi in truffle sauce... that alone to me was worth it!  \n\nI really liked that they offered \"organic\" items on their menu.  Kudos for that!\n\nAs a bonus, I actually just found out a friend was working there since I saw him bussing tables and told him it was my friend's birthday.  They came out with a beautiful dessert \"stone palette\" with the words \"Happy Birthday\" on it in chocolate.  The smores were awesome, as were the two types of ice cream/gelato and cake.  Well presented and super yummy.\n\nWould definitely dine here again. :)"

I totally whiffed on this one.  We were all very excited to eat oysters and enjoy a nice cut of steak before hitting the Vegas night club scene.  Oysters were small, did not seem very fresh, and were not shucked properly; meaning they were not completely detached from the shell.  We couldn't slurp them, we found ourselves biting into the actual oyster.  It was frustrating...I got the Ribeye, it  was good, not great.  We got two sides for the table: lobster mac and cheese and brussel sprouts.  Both were very small servings and were not anything special.  Service was forgettable, drinks were average, bill was hefty.  It is just frustrating since I know there are dozens of great steakhouses in Las Vegas and I chose this one.  I will not be returning..."

The atmosphere has a lounge feel, and it's actually quite loud in the restaurant with the music and lively slightly drunk patrons.  So if you are looking for romance...don't come here.  The company I was with was a little bit older...ie reading glasses required age...and they had a difficult time reading the menu because of how dim the lights were in the restaurant.  We started with a few appetizers, the crab cake is big enough to share for two and had more crab than fillers =).   The rock shrimp with the lemon aioli was quite good.  The calamari just seemed pretty average, not too spectacular.  Well when it comes to steak...this place is not on the top of my list...while the steak was flavorful since I ordered the dry aged bone in rib eye cajun style...the meat just wasn't tender like a nice marbled rib eye should be.   The side dishes really didn't impress me as well, the lobster mac and cheese was a little lack luster with small little bits of lobster noted.  The creamed spinach...well it seemed like it was missing the cream component.  The grilled veggies were typical fare and you can probably get this at Red Robin's.  The highlight of the sides were the button mushrooms and the creamed corn.  Overall, I was happy....since my meal was free, but otherwise I probably would pick a different steakhouse if I was looking for a nice date night meal."

It has the prices (and food) that go along with a fine dining establishment, but the service was so awful that all of the effort that goes into such is totally wasted. Maybe because I'm not a playboy bunny?  I noticed that the table adjacent to ours was fawned over by the same waiter. That table happened to have a very beautiful woman who apeared to be a model (a real one) seated at it. So here's the low-down:  we waited for about 15 minutes before our waiter materialized to take our drink and dinner order at the same time.  When I ordered my steak, I told him to bring us an order of each of the four steak sauces that I knew we would both enjoy. He looked at me as if I were insane, which prompted me to inquire if the sauces were extremely large servings. He told me I should maybe scale it back to one or two sauces, because they were 4$ each. Hmmm. So I'm spending hundreds of dollars on dinner and he thinks that a few $4 sauces are going to break my bank?  So I scaled back to only one sauce.  It was a pretty good peppercorn sauce, which I would have enjoyed more of, but the waiter disappeared when our food was delivered and we never saw him again.  Actually we saw him, but he was too busy fawning over the other nearby table to notice that we might like some more bread (completely gone), another drink (the sangria was very good), or anything else for that matter.  \nOnce again, very good food but absolutely the WORST SERVICE I have ever received anywhere in Las Vegas.  And I have been to quite a few restaurants there.  I will not be going back.  There are way too many excellent steakhouses in LV to suffer through this kind of lack of service."

It was noted for two reason: 1) More than $10 for a drink and b) $69... hehe, 69... \n-Hostess was fine, unlike the bitchy, unfed, bottled blonde at MIX\n-Steaks were good but hella expensive... $50??\n-After we ordered, we sat around for like an hour.  Now, thinking about it, sober, I figure it is so that people will order more drinks and appetizers and make the restaurant more money.  Of which we did order more drinks and appetizers.  Sneaky bastards.\n-Claire spilled.  But also, I spilled.  And then Nicole spilled as well.  Again, lots to drink.\n-No doilies here, unlike MIX\n-The burger was fantastic, excellent, excellent burger.  So juicy, and thick, and cooked to perfection.  Awesome.\n-I remember the ketchup being very good as well.\n-The pink pussy I'm referring to - it was a drink, prosecco (the real stuff, not that jizz in a can that Paris Hilton is hawking); with prosecco ice cubes.  I think the drink was called the \"Pink Pussycat\" or something.  But we liked referring it to as the \"Pink Pussy\" - again, adolescent humor from some late-twenty-somethings.\n\nN9NE was really good, it is expensive, but it is expected for Vegas steakhouse, at the Palms."

I think I actually got there on the early side, by the time I left, around 9:30, this place was packed. \n\nUpon entering you will be greeted by a beautiful hostess, which sets the tone for the night. Everything they do at N9NE is intended to be beautiful and hip, which, depending on what you like, can also get in the way of the experience. \n\nPersonally, I enjoyed it, the ambiance is almost too 'cool' for me, the fairly loud music makes you feel like it's a club, but it also sets the tone, which beckons you to live it up. The crowd is younger and generally dressed to impress. I will not waste your time, but I did have some celebrity sightings, which tells you the type of place this is. \n\nLet's get into the important part, food and drink. First, I had a dirty martini up, and it came with 3 blue cheese olives, which for me, distinguishes a place immediately. Not everyone will hand stuff the olives, so big ups to N9NE. \n\nAs an appetizer I tried the gnocchi, which was good but not great, and I also enjoyed the Wedge Salad, which did not disappoint. For my entree I enjoyed the 9oz filet (medium/rare), and it was perfection. As good a piece of meat as I've ever had. Superb! \n\nThe sides are all family style and my group enjoyed the asparagus (good) and the potatoes (good). My server was Heath, who had solid command of the menu and did a very nice job. The table service was on par, my water glass was never empty.   \n\nN9NE is the sexy/hip option when choosing a steak house in Vegas. If you plan to drink, have an appetizer and entree, AND dessert, probably around $100/person. Enjoy!"

If you're a sensible person who enjoys good food and getting value for money, stay away from N9NE.\n\nThe appetizers were boring and unoriginal, comparable in quality to most sports bars or your average Applebees.  The steak was well overcooked, and I find it hard to believe that even if it were cooked properly, it wouldn't be any better from a filet you can buy from any grocery store and cook yourself (I should note here that I had their signature \"world famous\" filet - or whatever self-indulgent tagline they were using to describe it that particular night).  \n\nThe decor of this place must be funded by the Massengill company, because it reeks of douche.  There is a big difference between trying to be modern, trendy, and chique, and trying too hard and falling on your face.  Maybe if they focused more energy on the food versus trendy mood lighting, this review would be different.  The only good thing that came out of my visit to N9NE was our waiter, I only hope that he's taken his talents to a restaurant worthy of him.\n\nThis is the worst meal I've ever had at any fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas, period."

Read from other reviews once others have gotten to the restaurant they make you wait awhile before they seat you even though it isn't full and there's tables open. I HATE THAT. I walked in saw tables set up and ready hoping it wouldn't happen to us, we waited for like 15 min. Sat at a table I saw was set and ready when I walked into the restaurant. Why the heck do you need to have people wait, do you not realize we're starving. It's so annoying- one reason I won't be back, that makes no sense.\n\nGot some of the oysters, they were actually good, came with a unique Pear-Red Wine Mignonette which gave them some points (5 stars)\n\nOrdered the Caesar (1 star)- The light in there is all purple as you can see from the pics, hard to see the food I don't like that. But as I kept eating I noticed the lettuce with that tinge of brown color, I noticed halfway through and I just got pissed. The lettuce wasn't fresh. I ate around it but didn't really want too, I was tired and cranky as hell so I put up with it and didn't send it back.\n\nI wasn't in the mood to eat a huge portion being hungover/tired/whatever vegas does to you and what not so I ordered another appetizer the SHORT RIB RAVIOLO for my meal, came with 4 pieces and I barely ate 3 so I guess it worked out for me hah. Came with truffles and sweet corn, actually not bad at all, good flavors, wish I was more hungry though (4 stars)\n\nThe truffle fries were too thick and we barely touched them. Everyone in my family said their dishes were OK, nothing to really rave about.\n\nNo dessert for us, we were dead beat tired, I just wanted to get out of there and sleep. Tried some other items, but everything was just OK. Salad turned me off. Not sure we'll be back, I'd rather go back to Joe's if we wanted seafood/steak."

The manager comes over and asks my friend to cut the burger in half and says look in the middle, that is medium.  Now first off, when a burger is $25 and when you are providing a service a restaurant would favor the customer.  Well it wasn't until we got the head manager that they took the burger away.

So when there were 2 gnocchi left on the platter, he picks it up, walks it down to the other side of the table and says here is your dish.  We were all like what the fuck did he just do?

The bone-in filet which was suggested to us by our waiter left something to be desired. Flavorful, yes, but it also had the fat and gristle you'd get in a Rib Eye.\n\nOverall, my biggest complaints about this restaurant were the ambiance and the service. It seems like it's trying to be more of a hip club than a steakhouse and, like the Palms in general, couldn't seem to figure out who they wanted to be, or to whom they wanted to cater. \n\nOur waiter was okay but a bit cocky and annoying. When we complained about our drinks being weak, he insisted that they are all equal as the bartenders use jiggers to measure the alcohol. Then he offered to get his manager who came over. The manager did come over with extra shots for the cocktails, but continued the argument the waiter was making about the measured drinks, and also telling us the quality of their mixers make their drinks look weak.

Plus, since my friend had heard some good things about it, it sounded like it was worth trying...and Yelping!\n\nWhen our party of 10 arrived, we were taken to our table almost immediately...off to a good start!  The decor is pretty nice - chic and contemporary, just like what you would expect from a \"hipper\" steakhouse.  The menu was a bit overwhelming with so much to choose from, but it got easier when I ruled out the non-beef entrees (we were at a steakhouse after all).  While half the table paired up to split the \"Bone-in Ribeye For Two\", I was stuck going solo...but I really wanted the same thing (this is where a gf would be handy).  So instead, ordered the 24oz Bone-in Ribeye (medium rare), while getting the lobster mashed potatoes to split with my buddy.\n\nThe potatoes were pretty awesome and probably my favorite part of the meal.  Not only could you taste the lobster, but there were chunks of it in the dish too.  Impressive compared to what I've had in the past.  As for the steak, I knew it was going to be hefty (though part of the weight was tied to the bone), but it still surpassed what I expected.  It looked fantastic when it was brought out though -  the surface had a nice char and grillmark to it.  There wasn't a lot of fat hanging off the meat, but it was still juicy when I cut into it.  I wish it had been more tender, but the taste was great.\n\nAlthough the steak was good for the most part, I did have one hang-up with it.  As I worked my way towards the center by the bone, the meat looked less like medium rare and more like rare.  When I glanced over at my friend's steak to compare them, I saw that his had the same problem.  We both debated on sending our plates back (which I don't typically do) so that they could fire it a bit more, but we figured it wouldn't be worth it.  There wasn't much meat left on the bone anyways, and the rest of our table was just about done.  Still, you would think that for a higher end steakhouse, they should at least be able to cook their steaks more evenly than that.\n\nBeing that we were all pretty full from the meal, none of us had any room for dessert, despite a couple that sounded rather enticing.  The whole restaurant can get pretty noisy, but I really liked the chill yet trendy vibe...different for a steakhouse.  Sadly, the uneven cooking was a downer.  I don't have a (huge) problem with spending money for a pricier meal (and this place is pricey), but for ~$60, they could at least cook it better.  I'd be open to coming back again, but I would rather try a new spot like Craftsteak first.  If/when I do come back again, I'll be sure to check the meat before I start eating."

It was midweek so it was pretty easy to get a reservation.\n\nLocated between RAIN and Ghost Bar, it's centrally located to side of the casino closest to the elevators to both towers.  When I got inside, I immediately noticed the modern decor and purple mood lighting.  I liked.  There's a bar immediately to the right, and the main dining room next to it with some private rooms farther inside.\n\nFood: I started off with the lobster bisque, we shared the ahi tuna tartar, and then I shared a rib eye steak and order of seared scallops.  The bisque was good - not the best I've had but excellent.  It had a large chunk of lobster on a plate, and they proceeded to pour in the piping hot soup on top of it.  Just the way I like it.  The ahi tuna was typical - nothing special here, but presentation was very nice.  It came out in a kind of cone shaped hand-roll style.  The real treat was the main courses.  The rib-eye was by far one of the best steaks I've had anywhere.  Juicy and tender, it melted in your mouth and was full of flavor.  The other dish, the seared scallops were equally as good, being extraordinarily fresh and large.  Each scallop was probably 2-3 inches in diameter.  \n\nDidn't have the chance to have any desserts because we were definitely stuffed after the meal, but I would love to revisit and try again.  Highly recommended - even with the other great choices Vegas has to offer these days!"

While our rib eye steaks were quite good, and the side were good as well, our $120 shellfish platter was absolutely terrible and a disgrace.  First of all, all items were served too cold, as if they hadn't finished defrosting yet.  The lobster, oysters, and shrimp were all tasteless.  The clams had a downright bad taste and the mussels were over cooked.\n\nAbout 1/2 an hour following the meal, several of us, including myself, began to feel dizzy and sweat profusely.  Then the fun began as we took turns vomiting violently our $1500 meal into our hotel room toilet.  There was no question that the cause was... bad shellfish.  Fortunately we were able to purge most of the evil from our system and continue our evening.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the restaurant refused to add the bill to our room tab, claiming that it was too large.  Too large!  We should get special treatment for spending $1500 at this mediocre establishment.  This meant that this money poorly spent did not even count towards future comps from our hotel.\n\nEven thought the steaks were good, you would expect consistency for that amount of money.  I just called the restaurant and was transfered to the managers office, which rang 20 times with no answer.  Then called again and they told me they are going to have a manager call me back when they get in at 3pm.  Am now wondering why they even tried to transfer me to the manager's office when no one was in!\n\nWill wait to see what they have to say, but likely will not be returning to this vomitorium in future."

Not bad at all.\n\nLet's get straight to the point - the food. I ordered the 24 oz bone-in rib eye, and it tasted great.  The only problem was that I didn't feel like the meat was top quality.  There was definitely too much fat that needed to be cut off. The meat texture wasn't all that great either. But again, the taste of the meat was great. \n\nAs far as the appetizers - PASS. We ordered some type of fried shrimp starter which came, seriously, in a paper box.  One of my friends hit the nail right on the head when it he remarked that \"it looks like something from popeyes.\" It literally came out 5 minutes after we ordered. There's no question that it was microwaved or that it was just sitting underneath a heater waiting for people willing to shell out $12 for an order. You might as well pay $1.99 for the popcorn shrimp at Popeyes.\n\nThe sides were not bad. We had the lobster mashed potatoes and also the garlic bean sprouts.  The bean sprouts were great. The lobster mashed potatoes were also good. They weren't quite as good as the lobster mashed at Mastro's, but still pretty good.  However, the portions were miniscule. At least the steaks were hearty enough to fill our stomaches. \n\nAmbiance - the place had purple club/lounge vibe with heavy hip hop music blaring and just a large bustle. There were a couple of plasma TVs behind the bar and also in the \"private\" rooms (with see-through glass doors).  \n\nApparantly, the place is popular among celebrities, or at least athletes. Halfway through our meal, Juwan Howard, Michael Finley, and Howard Eisley sat down at the table right behind us, about 1 feet away. Two of those guys are worth at least $100 million and Eisley is worth at least $55 million.  I wanted to ask them to pay for my steak. My friends wanted to ask them why they sucked so bad. \n\nLastly, price. The steaks are a bit steaper in price than the average steak place. I think it was approximately $55 or $60 per steak. \n\nOverall, I was satisfied with the meal. It wasn't the best, but it exceeded the expecations I had (low).  I would definitely go back if a friend wanted to, but I would prefer to try another one of the many well-reputed steak joints in town."

I arrived dressed to the nines for N9NE steakhouse (see what I did there?) and immediately ordered their finest Chardonnay. Little did I know that would be the most enjoyable item from the menu that night. My husband has an affinity for buffalo sauce, so we promptly ordered the buffalo wontons. We waited for the hors d'oeurves with much anticipation. The excitement began to diminish 45 mins into the waiting game with no apps and little service. Guy FIERI would cringe at this wannabe Chili's creation. Lesson learned that buffalo ANYTHING should stick to its dive inspired culture. These wontons were SOGGY and late. They had not defrosted from the Costco bag I assume they originated from. I thought the hiccup in the appetizers would be the worst of it; after all I never trust Leonard's suggestions. We decided to split the garbage salad. As the name so subtly suggested, IT WAS GARBAGE. I was truly rooting for the tomahawk prime rib to be the savior of our lackluster dining experience. HOWEVER, I should have just sauntered into an Outback Steakhouse for a better surf and turf. We ordered the meat medium rare, and it arrived nearly blackened like it came from my nieces elementary school fundraiser cookout. The lobster claims to be from Australia, but I can assure you it was from the local Chinese lobster pound. Needless to say it was chewy and I questioned if I had perhaps ordered calamari. I didn't. This steakhouse is the epitome of false luxury. Find me at the slot machines if you have any questions. I intend to win back the money I lost at this epically foul establishment."

I finished every single bite of my food despite knowing the fact that I was sitting in my dress headed to the club right after. Didn't want to waste a perfectly superb meal at the cost of $65-$80 a plate. The waiters were extremely attentive to our table. Who knows maybe it was because we were a table of six hot looking ladies? Just kidding. \n\nThis place did not disappoint."

The bar is beautiful or is it just filled with beautiful people?\n\nThe last time I was here I started with a salad and shrimp cocktail.  Then for the main course my dad split a steak and lobster for some surf and turf action.  But both times I went I ordered a couple things that are not to miss.  First, are the sides.  I love places where the sides are so good that you would have been content to just make a whole meal out of them.  This is one of those places!  Secondly, both times I had a side of the gnocchi, or as they refer to them as \"little pillows of heaven\". They are scrumptious.  If you miraculously find a way to still be hungry at the end of the meal then you'll love what they serve for dessert."

When he came back out he served them to me steamed al dente.

Just off of the Strip, The Palms is the place to see and be seen, as is the steakhouse there. I made reservations for 10 of my friends, N9NE was very accommodating especially since i had to change my reservation twice. However, don't be late especially if you are  going to dinner with a big group, their reservations rules are kinda strict but its understandable ($25 cancellation fee per person!). \n\nMy friends and i arrive 5 mins before our 730pm reservation and was seated promptly. As i walked into N9NE i can tell i was going to enjoy my dinner. I loved the 9 in the front of the door and the modernize decor with a blue hue.  The dining area is quite small here, with a round caviar bar in the center of the restaurant. N9NE was playing BETTER music than the clubs in Vegas especially Tao. \n\nThe food here was amazing. Most of the group ordered the Fillet Mignon & 16oz NY Sirloin BUT 4 of my friends decided to split the \"The Best of N9NE\" for $235 which serves up to 4 people. The Best of N9NE included NY Sirloin, Colorado Lamb Chops, Truffle Chicken, Main e Lobster, Gulf shrimps, Alaskan King crab and Potato Gnocchi. Also, our menu included 4 different sauces for each items (meat & seafood). i was overwhelmed! I thought the food wasn't going to fill us up BUT we were wrong! 3 of my guy friends and myself alone couldn't finish everything, we had to force ourselves to finish because we didn't want to waste anything! There was TOO much food!  My favorite items from the Best of N9NE was the lamb chops & gulf shrimps. The lamb chops was perfectly cooked and grill to perfection. \n\nThe service was very attentive and our waiter came by a couple of times to check up on us. Please remember there is a 18% gratuity fee when you are dining in a big group. Our bill came out to $780 without drinks. I thought the price was average and worth every penny for the experience and having fun with my friends. \n\nOverall, our dining experience left us still craving it. Definitely a stop every time we are in Vegas."

Okay, it isn't the most expensive place ever, but it is more spendy than your usual place in LV.  And it was good, don't get me wrong, the food was fine, the service was pleasant, it was a nice experience.  I didn't like the decor; it looks like a nightclub that happens to serve steak.  If I'm eating a 50 dollar plate of lamb, I don't want to yell at my dining companions to be heard over the blare of really bad 90's rock music.  The environment is sterile and cold, with silver and black tones.  I just don't get it.  Why charge that much for food and then have a lackluster, boring, cold, loud dining room?   I probably wont ever go back, but it was a nice birthday dinner for my sister and the s'mores plate was delicious.  Creme brulee was also good, the snickers dessert was not impressive."

Our hostess told us that our table wasn't ready, but that we could wait in the lounge area. We walked toward the bar to find only one empty table reserved for someone else, and the bar completely full. A moment later, we were informed that the table was reserved for us until our dinner table was ready.\n\nWe all ordered some drinks and just sat back for a minute. I was soaking it all up, when we were told our table was ready and we were relocated. Our table sat across from Luke Trembath, aka The Dingo, and there were some other VIPs next to us. Needless to say, definitely  a spot to catch some famous faces. \n\nThe place has a bit of a club feel, with it's dim lighting, neon accents and club music, but nothing was overwhelming. We could talk amongst ourselves without having to talk over everyone else AND the music just fine. Our wait staff was unbelievable! We were attended to every five minutes to make sure we were absolutely happy with everything, and if anything was needed, or our drinks were getting low, it was replenished with the quickness.\n\nWe ordered some steak fries, shoestring fries, mac n cheese, and calamari to pair with our entrees. The calamari, was absolutely AMAZING. Hands down, had to be one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. Fries are fries, and the veggies were alright.\n\nI had a filet mignon, and it was ridiculous how good it was. It came served with some delicious bearnaise too! It was definitely worth the ~$50. The others had a NY strips and porterhouses. After drinks, sides and meals, it was probably $100/ea, and worth EVERY penny.\n\nI'll definitely be back for more of N9NE!"

I definitely don't do sashimi at home, so I always count on restaurants to do it for me.

A huge 40 oz ribeye on a platter served with lobster mac and cheese and season vegetables.  At first I was giong to ask to substitute the veggies because I was expecting your typical zuchinni and squash but I was very pleasantly surprised!  Our veggies were a large serving of grilled asparagus(done to perfection), shallots, and mushrooms.  It was such a perfect combination!  I didn't care too much for the mac n cheese but I do have to say there were some big chunks of lobster in there.  I just felt that the cheese was too cheesy LOL.  The only thing I wish they did differently was I wish they did not preslice our steak.  I can understand why they did it since it was one large steak meant to feed two people but it really did leave the steak a bit dry.  They served it with a cab sauce but for me, I really prefer my steaks with all of it's own flavor and juices.  They also served this with two bone marrows. AWESOME!!

We ordered a couple beers and a couple glasses of cab to pair with the steak. We also ordered a couple sides, one being a loaded baked potato. The steaks were great, nice cuts, cooked to a perfect medium rare and served on a cold plate. \n\nMy friend suggested that he wanted some Tabasco sauce to put on the potato, as it was fairly bland which I agreed. When I asked the older bartender for Tabasco, he responded with anger, \"You don't need Tabasco, this is N9NE steakhouse, are you kidding me\" and he proceeded to walk off. \n\nI thought to myself, he is exactly right, this is N9NE! However, there are far better steakhouses in Las Vegas not to mention across the county. How dare he tell me how I can and can't eat my meal, regardless of how he thinks it should be devoured. \n\nAnother bartender kindly brought the Tabasco and I let the situation go, being that I didn't want to make a scene. I usually don't write reviews, but in this case I had to share my experience which was ruined by one comment. I dine in Vegas often and will stick with SW and Cut from now on. \n\n\nNote: I still tipped 20% on top of the entire bill, being that there were 2 other bartenders that actually helped out and were sincere. Also, I would rate the food 4 Stars. A classic example of why you should always evaluate your help."

The asparagus was in a sauce that was delightful. I have never tasted anything this good. The fries were excellent as well. The only downside here was the terrible service. Our waiter really tried hard. But it was obvious he had no training. There was no decorum or politeness to it. He did not remember who had ordered what. When the food came he was holding up plates asking who had what. Ugh. What has happened to fine dining. I must say that all restaurants at The Palms have good food and bad service actually. Except for Simon. How about a food server training Maloofs?"

The hip steakhouse was so busy by the time we arrived. I guess we weren't the only ones who made romantic plans with their significant other. ;-)\n\nThe menu for the evening was limited. It gave guests the option of choosing a 4-course meal or a 5-course meal, both including sides. Although we were rather hungry, we decided on the 4-course meal. I'm glad we did too, because we left the restaurant stuffed! It's okay though, because the food was delicious. Here's everything I was able to try:\n\nShort Rob Ravoli - Delicious! Perfectly filled with tender beef, chanterelle mushrooms, and parmesan cheese in a pancetta cream sauce. Easily one of my favorites of the night.\n\nN9NE Rock Shrimp - Crispy, golden shrimp served with two sauces: A Sriracha blend & a lemon aioli. The bite-sized shrimp paired really well with the sweet & spicy Sriracha sauce.\n\nArugula Salad - Very distasteful. The bitterness of the grapefruit vinaigrette and the warm goat cheese was so overwhelming.\n\n7oz Filet Mignon - Saut\u00e9ed in red wine sauce & white truffle aioli. I ordered mine medium-well, and it was perfect! Soft, juicy, and flavorful, just the way I like it.\n\nLobster Mashed Potatoes - Please order this! Fresh Maine lobster paired with Yukon gold potatoes is just amazing. You can really taste the freshness of the mouth-watering lobster.\n\nAsparagus - Nothing special, but I love asparagus with my steak. They just go well together. N9NE serves long, thick pieces of asparagus in a tasty combination of lemon, shallots, and olive oil.\n\nMoist Devil's Food Cake - Chocolate cake with chocolate gelato. Talk about chocolate overload! My chocoholic Hubby definitely enjoyed this one, but it's not really my thing.\n\nNew York Style PBJ - Since Hubby took over the Devil's cake, I got to indulge in this decadent dessert. It's a creative spin-off of a PBJ sandwich using New York Cheesecake, a Peanut Butter Macaron, and Blackberry gelato. Super yummy! The flavors all went so well together.\n\n4 stars because I don't think the prices justify some of the dishes we had. Our meal was, however, accompanied with friendly service and a cool, lively atmosphere. The hostesses even gave every girl a single red rose! So sweet! It was a really great evening at N9NE. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion (like us) or just looking for a nice place to dine, I'd recommend this highly regarded steakhouse to anyone."

Service was awesome as we had one server concentrating on drinks, a server focused on food, and a busser in charge of clearing the settings.\n\nWe were provided a pre-fix menu, which included an apettizer of popcorn shrimp, a salad, a selection of a handful of entrees and dessert.  The starter and dessert courses were fine... nothing outstanding. \n\nFor my entree, I chose the kobe burger.  I don't think I'd ever pay $30 bucks for a burger but again, someone else was footing the bill.  It was one of the best burgers I've consumed.  The kobe beef was paired with maytag cheese, and thick cut smoked applewood bacon.  This burger was bold... melt in your mouth good.  \n\nOne oddity was their preparation of the Old Fashioned that I was drinking.  The orange wasn't muddled as typically prepared.  Instead, the full slice of orange was stuck horizontally in the middle of the glass making consuming the cocktail precarious.  Not a deal-breaker, but it was the first time I've experienced this.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed my meal here.  Service was awesome, and I got to eat one of the best burgers I've ever tried."

There was just something missing in most of the dishes. The only thing that made up for the a subpar meal were the assortment of breads and my salad. That's not really saying much....\n\n\nI really enjoyed my salad. They split-ted our portions and our plate was each topped w/ an egg which I thought was very thoughtful.\n\nOysters were really tiny, while some were more plump than others. I wouldn't have minded, but the flavor didn't have me wanting to slurp for more of the ocean's pearl. \n\nI liked that they showed you how much lobster pieces were in the bowl, before they poured the broth over. It was slightly sweet, but was missing a certain umami greatness.\n\nLobster mashed potatoes came w/ huge chunks of flesh, which I was more then happy about. But it fails in comparison to the better lobster mash I've had.\n\nCreamed corn was slightly stale tasting and was not rich and creamy enuff for the hubby's tastes.\n\nI had the 18oz dry aged bone in ribeye, topped w/ fois gras, cooked at med rare but came out to be a medium to med-well. For the price of $68+20 I expected melt in my mouth, steak that was cooked to temp perfection. Sadly I was regretting more that I didn't choose a more safer choice, somewhere on the strip that was much nicer and cheaper. \n\nHubby ordered the 32oz prime rib and he wanted medium but I said med rare would prolly be best just in case they overcook it, which they completely did w/ my steak. But he wasn't happy that his steak was rare when it came out so we asked for it to be medium. Well it came out medium all right after they took it back, but it no longer had the soft texture of a prime rib. They basically just reheated the prime rib and it just killed everything.\n\nWe was an extremely disappointing experience, and I wish we chose a more safer place for steaks. Oh well, lesson learned."

They used La Nova wing sauce from Buffalo, NY, and my husband loved them, he couldn't wait to have them again. Well it turns out they took them off the menu last week. This is where the 5 stars come in, Roberto our waiter/bartender, talked to the kitchen and had them make the new pork wontons buffalo style for us. They were fantastic! \n\nWe also order the rock shrimp, the sauce comes on the side, one creamy, one spicy, mix them how you like and dip the shrimp in, I liked this. We also had filet mignon sliders, 3 sliders with shoestring potatoes,  also very good. After splitting the 3 apps we were full.The HH menu is a great deal.\n\nService was phenomenal!
