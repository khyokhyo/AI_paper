I ordered a burger with sweet potato fries. It definitely hit the spot. The ladies had salad, crab tostini  and theirs was very good as well.  Giving a four stars because I have had better burger before but love the ambiance, service and location which is next door to Convention Center."

For younger members of your party, the children's menu is simple yet delicious. The Mac and cheese is the best! Try it! Service is amazing! Go to the Veranda if u can."

It is located in the Four Seasons Hotel. We love to sit outside by the pool. The food and service are always top notch. Every server we have had has been nothing short of pleasant and makes it a very enjoyable dining experience. \n\nTheir brunch is small, but delicious! Price also includes freshly squeezed orange juice or coffee."

While the room appears lovely, with windows overlooking the elegantly styled Four Season's pool, the bar itself is non-descript with nothing special about it.  Service was preumptory, with no personality and light pours.  The experience was so banal, that I would be concerned with dining here.  Thus, while I'm staying at the Four Seasons, I will avoid eating at Veranda.  Besides, it's a lousy name for an Italian restaurant."

            "review": "The ultimate brunch mecca. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined the delicacies I would try at Veranduh. \n\nI was determined to find a fabulous brunch spot in Vegas for a bachelorette weekend. Not wanting a diner-like place, I was ecstatic when I found Veranduh. I called well in advance and they had room for our party of 9. The day of, we arrived a few minutes early, so our table was not ready yet. We happily waited in the Four Seasons pool area.\n\nWe were then seated at a spectacular outdoor table. The menu offers a la carte items or a buffet style brunch for $37. Drinks were additional but the Unlimited Bloody Mary Bar sold me. \n\nFirst things first, get to the Bloody Mary bar. It had all the fixins'. All types of hot sauces, olives, pickles, bacon, salts, etc. If you had at least 2 (which you will, because it is so delicious), the cost paid for itself.\n\nNow on to the buffet. Holy moly. They have everything you could think of including:\n\nOmelet Station\nMini Huevos Rancheros (in mini cast iron skillets, I die)\nEggs Benedict\nLox\nPancakes\nWaffles\nPastries\nAll types of breads (bagels, croissants, etc).\nMake your own donuts (well, someone makes them for you but you get to choose exactly how you want it!)\n\nI would rather go here every day for brunch and not eat any other meal. \n\nIt is expensive, yet somehow reasonable considering you are in Vegas. The food and drinks are worth every penny. Service was top notch (I wouldn't expect anything less at the Four Seasons). Great for a group, also!\n\nMy only warning would be: pace yourself. Try everything but save room for the next dish.\n\nI hope breakfast in heaven is at Verdanduh every day."

Sure, it's $15 for two, but good luck finding pancakes this amazing anywhere else. So moist and flavorful with a phenomenal cranberry compote and the most perfect under-sweetened syrup. They almost couldn't even be classified as pancakes.\n\nService was impeccable -I'm sure it helps to have a large group of business associates. ;-)"

            "review": "This place is awesome!! It's pretty much hidden inside the Four Seasons hotel.  I've never been to the Four Seasons for all the years I've been to Vegas.  I decided to look for a really good Sunday brunch place. After searching for an hour or so, I decided to go to Verandah.\n\nFinding parking without valet was a bit challenging at the Four Seasons.  I managed to find a huge parking lot that was south of the hotel.  I wasn't sure if it was for the Mandalay Bay beach resort or for the Four Seasons but I parked there anyways.  There didn't seem to have any signs at all what it was for.  If you drive towards the entrance of the Four Seasons, it's valet only.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the left after you go inside, past the PRESS cafe, which supposedly has really good cronuts.  When I got there on Sunday, it was already sold out, so I couldn't try it.\n\nI booked a reservation with opentable before coming to the restaurant.  The server was pretty attentive and got me seated within a few mins of arriving.  The place wasn't packed at all but had a decent amount of people.\n\nI seat outside, which was next to the pool area.  It was blocked off with some trees, so the patrons at the pool weren't bothersome.  After digging through the menu, I opted for the buffet brunch.  It was $40 with unlimited drinks, if you wanted Mimosas and such, you need to pay about $10 more.  \n\nAs I scoured through the food, everything looked good.  I tried almost everything and I had to say, it was good!  The scrambled eggs with salmon were perfect, not too much salt and had the perfect taste.  \n\nThe food varieties for the brunch ranged from banana pancakes, eggs benedicts to fresh made mini donuts (check the photo).  The waiter service was prompt and they automatically refilled my drink when I went for another round of food.\n\nI would highly recommend this place!"

            "review": "Starting at the parking lot you have extremely polite valet attendants and people opening the doors and welcoming you. Walk to your left and enter the Verandah. Do yourself a favor and ask for the outdoor seating. You can hear birds chirping, soft relaxing music, a peaceful waterfall, heat lamps, covered patio so no sun in your eyes. I instantly transported myself to the 4 Seasons in Maui which I fell in love with. Towards the end of our breakfast the pool was filling up. I think the earlier you get to the restaurant the better so you're not experiencing the pool crowd. Even then there were no screaming kids, still relaxing.\n\nOn to the food, its hard for me to decline a customized omelette bar. The ingredients were good but I think a homemade salsa would be much more appropriate for the high price tag we were paying. This was Pace picante salsa straight from the jar. Also a few more gourmet items such as sun dried tomatoes or goat cheese would have been nice. The highlight for me were the mushrooms and spinach which were cooked perfectly.  On to the hot items. Eggs Benedict was delicious, frittata, quiche, corned beef hash, scrambled eggs with salmon, scone with lemon curd, mascarpone cheese blintz with roasted apple glaze, vanilla bread pudding (couldn't try this because it was in a such a big bowl, wish they had a mini size), applewood smoked bacon, peppered bacon, guava pancakes, and more. \n\nThere were a bunch of pastries I did not touch. My husband got a pastry and it was rock hard. I'm thinking people don't waste their time on those pastries and it was old. \n\nOn to the next section- bagels, breads, smoke salmon, capers, tomatoes,  onions and do not miss the honey roasted peanut butter made fresh!!! I asked and there are no other ingredients. It's outstanding! I enjoyed the mini banana parfait with candied walnuts and homemade granola. \n\nThe juices included was fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh mixed berry juice (including watermelon, cantaloupe, and berries blended together). It was really yummy! They also offer coffee. The service was too notch. I never once had to ask for anything but it wasn't pushy and annoying. Drinks were filled and they walked away, I appreciated them not interrupting conversations. They were quick to take plates and asked if we needed anything but like I said it wasn't too much. \n\nDon't be like me and stuff yourself and not leave room for the fresh donuts!! Don't miss out on the donuts. Now take a bite of bacon then a bite of a mini glazed donut and now yours in heaven!!!\n\nFor $7 more you can have a Bloody Mary from the bar. You make it yourself with lots of complimenting toppings and additions!! They also have an option of unlimited Bloody Marys! \n\nI think I would have enjoyed this experience just as much with ordering off the menu. It's pretty expensive for breakfast but a nice treat that has some good quality items."

Got here, there was a lot of seats available outside =T The service was a bit slow. Ordered coffee and that took a while =\\ asked for balsamic vinaigrette took about 5-7 mins.It wasn't busy there was only a few tables.\n\nThe table in front of us left and I was just seeing how long it took them to clean the table. They didn't clean it right away. They cleaned it when we were leaving about 40 mins later. sigh \n\nOrdered the Cobb lobster salad $26.00   Seafood mac & Cheese $20.00 & salmon sandwich with bacon etc for $24.00\n\nThe salad was ok =T had much better before. Nothing special to it. Won't remember it. The seafood mac & cheese was decent and light tasting. The salmon sandwich was heavy & greasy. The bread was nice and toasted but it seems like they put better or oil on it cause my hands was soo greasy from picking it up. The sauce and mozzarella cheese made it very heavy for my breakfast.  Yes my breakfast is most people's lunch =P I wake up late. \n\nThe food was nothing great and nothing that I will be recalling to come back. the service was nice and super slow which I didn't like at all. Also how you going to ask someone how everything is when you just put my plate down. I didn't even try it. And also if I said it's not good your going to make me another one? that I need to wait another 15 mins for =T Sshsh"

We got to sit on the patio and it was a perfect setting...next to the pool. They started out with a bread/cracker basket with a wonderful white bean dip. The dip was so good we had to order seconds. We had a scrumptious salad. Normally I dislike blue cheese because it is a \"strong\" cheese; however, this salad had such a good combination of textures and flavors. The ice tea was spectacular as the ice cubes were made from ice tea. The sweet potato fries had just the right combination of sweetness and saltiness. Service was very good and very friendly. Overall, a very relaxing, pleasant visit."

We had a Sat brunch there. Before we go in, I was debating whether I should have a la carte or the brunch since we had a heavy meal the night before. I finally decided on the brunch because it was just a deal when juice and coffee is included and they will make whatever juice you want as long as they have the fruits. Even though the brunch does not have an omelet station but the kitchen will make whatever omelet you want and it is included in the brunch price. Overall, the food is good ( not excellent ) but the great service and the environment just made a very relaxing experience. We would definitely go back."

We were there for a full 6 days, and if we go back, this is one of the only places we will bother to visit again. The inside of the restaurant was fairly busy, but the patio was almost empty (February). Heaters made the patio very comfortable, and it was so nice and quiet, which is hard to find in Vegas. The service was fast and extremely friendly with good advice and knowledge of the foods and wines. I picked a wine to have by the glass, and when I was only semi pleased with it, the waiter was quick to recommend another and was spot on in his advice from my description of what I like. The food was so fresh and well prepared, it was almost startling. Even their iced tea is really good, and made with ice tea ice cubes to avoid dilution! Talk about detail!"

I was lucky enough to be invited to dinner by a friend of mine, whose parents were in town and were staying at the Four Seasons.  I loved the ambiance the wait staff was professional, courteous, and attentive and provided the level of service you would expect from a luxury hotel restaurant. I think what's unique about this restaurant is that you can have any dish in an appetizer size or an entree size, and the dish is priced accordingly. I had the clam linguini, appetizer size and it was delicous the white wine sauce was superb along with the pasta, freshly chopped tomatoes, and clams.  Verandah also serves excellent bread while you wait for your meal. If you have an expense account, I highly recommend this restaurant."

And, that, it was for us. For starters, my man wanted lunch-type stuff, and I wanted breakfast, so the servers brought us both menus and said it would be no problem to serve either. Ah... I could get used to this... \n\nStar 1 - The Huevos Rancheros. Perfect combo of eggs, cheese, beans, and spices. Also, the fantastic servers (see Star 5 below) were able to whip up a spicier blend of the house salsa that is served as a side. After eating at a resto which prides itself on Mexi food (see my review of Hussong's) on the same weekend, I was pleasantly surprised at the authentic quality of this dish. \n\nStar 2 - the gluten free lemon pancakes. Yum and yum. You could taste the hint of lemon in each bite, but it was not too overpowering. Perfection. \n\nStar 3 - the mahi mahi soft tacos. Again, perfect fish-to-everything else ratio so that you could actually taste all of the ingredients and marvel at how well they worked together. Also, a special shout out to the accompanying guac. \n\nStar 4 - Beverages - First, let's start with the Latte, which I asked be served with a shot of hazelnut. This latte might just be the best I've had in Vegas. No sugar-additives needed, and it tasted very creamy, even though they substituted the real milk for almond milk. And (drum rolls please) -- their iced tea. With the iced tea ice cubes (so that the tea doesn't taste watered down), and the liquid sugar pour (so that each sip of tea tastes like the last one since the liquid sugar dissolves more quickly), it is deliciousness in a glass. \n\nStar 5 - Leo and Lucio - our servers. I should probably have broken them out into separate stars but I'm running out of stars here!! No request big or small was too much for them. The fact that we had 2 servers for 2 diners should alone tell you how far they will go to make sure you have a great meal. These two gents only helped make this meal that much more fantastic. \n\nLest you think we are a couple of barbarians, we did have a special situation which allowed us to sample many dishes at the same time. No, we did not eat everything we ordered at one seating.... that said, these were some of the best leftovers ever!"

There are really cool combinations of breakfast items and there is so much to choose from, all of which is delicious, that you have to come hungry.\nMy friend and I were thoroughly impressed and have no hesitation about coming back.

It was culinary pampering.  Exquisite, white glove service, insanely good coffee and delicious breakfast options.  They make custom blend fruit juice, i think ours was peach mango OJ or something...outstanding.\n\nAs usual, you get what you pay for.  Enjoy!  :-)"

            "review": "This is a review specifically on the Afternoon Tea that the Four Seasons Verandah offers.  I attended this place with my mother to celebrate her visit to Vegas and I decided to take her to afternoon tea here.  \n\nAfternoon Tea here is offered from 3-4pm from Mon/Fri.\nHoly cow.  After that experience at Bellagio, this was just -wonderful.-\n\nThe view out into the gardens was beautiful.  Their current theme of decor was Lilies and they were everywhere, designed into beautiful arcs that hung gracefully in a festoon that was minimalist and graceful.  We had a single table by the window and it was just a must.  It was summer and everywhere we gazed out our glass windows was lush green, green, green.  It was so tranquil and a firm glass of serenity that you rarely can find in Vegas which, to a certain extent, I will be more than happy to pay a ton of money for.  \n\nOf course, being that was at one of the top-shelf properties here in Vegas, I knew going in that it was going to be not cheap.  But it wasn't outrageous and I didn't feel uncomfortable with the price.  The service was top-notch, the quality of the blend of tea, the scones and food was excellent, and I was very satisfied with the entire experience.  \n\nWhen someone asks me where the best Afternoon Tea in Vegas is, I respond with this establishment, if that says anything.\n\n***On my List of Afternoon Teas in Vegas, this is currently rated as #1.  Please check out my list of Tea Houses, both local and national to compare.**"

The eggs benedict is perfectly prepared, served over tender polenta cakes along with snapping asparagus spears.

The son got mini belgian waffles that he smothered in cinnamon butter and syrup.  The service was perfect and the atmosphere is far more relaxing than fighting the lines at the casino buffets."

It's a lovely environment and at dinner the food was quite good--fresh, well-presented, high quality.  One of the better meals I had in Vegas.  The service, during what appeared to be a very slow night, was abysmal; inattentive and rushed (when it came time for the check), not well timed, and overall unimpressive.  I found myself having to look for someone when I needed something, like a glass of wine, and yet the check was presented to me without bothering to ask if there was anything else I would like.  There is too much competition in Vegas to return to a restaurant with bad service."

There were numerous tables, private rooms, and booths.  But we were sat against the window wall where you couldn't really see the outside because it was getting dark.  But you can see the private pool surrounded by green forestry, would probably be nice to sit out there and dine.  The service was good, server was attentive but the restaurant wasn't busy yet and the food runner knocked our socks off.  I lost all my pictures on my phone so I'm relying on the blurry dishes opposite of my foodie buddy Angela T's uploaded photos since we came here for restaurant week.  \n\nOn paper the menu looked outstanding, worthy of the $50.12 price marked.  And compared to the other items offered at other places for the same mark I thought Verandah played it too conservative with such high level of culinary technique.  The drink I ordered didn't impress but the server did replace it.  \n\nThe best food runner ever, not because he was Hawaiian, came out with a complimentary appetizer.  The soup and spoon sides were great.  The first course came out and mine beat Angela's.  I tasted her risotto because I love risotto and it was ahh maybe cooked a little bit longer than needed.  I think argula is one of the better tasting greens out there, the flower is even better but it was fresh.  My first course was a scallop, jumbo shrimp, and can't remember the third item but it was placed on top of a nice sauce and topped with a delicious flavor foam.  The spoon had a sweet fruit taste which completely refreshed my palette.  The runner told me it was to be eaten in one direction to the other.  The second course was what caught my attention and what brought me here.  This dish was so plain.  The monkfish itself was prepared perfectly though so there really was no hating it but there really was no way of loving it also.  I ordered the other dessert just so we could split it and try the others dessert and to me they both ended up being ordinary as well.  For me two of the three courses was just so plain, my appetizer was great though.\n\nThere were some great skills used when preparing our Restaurant Week courses and I appreciate the participation otherwise I would have never come here for dinner.  Culinary skills and mix of flavor to me outshined the bland main course, the complimentary appetizer was appreciated as well and our food runner was on top of every ingredient and knowledge into  how each dish was created.  I thought he was our chef with the way he explained each item as he delivered it to us."

It is secluded enough to give diners and swimmers some privacy, but still be out in the warm sunshine. \n\nThe food is what surprised me. I got the salmon salad and shared the tuna three ways. My friend got the crab cake sliders and it was all delicious. The crab retained its texture and did not gum together like one which is made of all bread crumbs. The aioli is on the heavy side. The salmon was cooked to perfection. A beautiful medium with a nice warm center. It broke apart without flaking everywhere. The use of dressing was light and the flavors of the artichoke and other vegetables were present. The tuna three ways was okay. I am not a huge roll type of person, so I could do without it. The upside was that they did not skimp of the center. It was predominantly spicy tuna. The poke was decent. Nothing spectacular. The thick slices seared was the best of the offerings."

I got the Grilled Portobello Parmesan, which if you get the portobello without the breading is egg-free, as I have an egg allergy. It's a decent grilled portobello mushroom and veggie patty, but nothing to write home about. I also couldn't resist getting a side of the truffle parmesan fries which normally come with the burger (and amounted to $8 worth of fries), and they were quite nice, if not particularly truffle-y; I really like truffle, so that was a little sad. My companions got a menagerie of items (there were 7 of us total), including the Chicken & Waffles, the Traditional Corned Beef & Pastrami Hash Skillet, the Chicken Angel Hair Pasta, and the Tuna Sampler. Everyone seemed pretty satisfied with their food, and the buffet looked pretty good, too (except that I probably could only have eaten like two things on it, so of course it made no sense for me to get that). One companion got a bloody mary as well and seemed pleased with that.\n\nThe service was lovely--our waiter was great looking things up for me and with making suggestions to group members who were on the fence about what to have. I don't think there's anything on the menu that would be vegan as is, but if you're vegan, I'm pretty sure your waiter here could work something out with the kitchen for you. It would be nice to see a vegetarian section (including a vegan sub-section and/or some markers for common allergens like dairy and nuts), but otherwise it was a lovely experience.\n\nOverall, a tasty, if pricey meal, but if I were brunching in the area again, I'd certainly be willing to return :)"

There is also outdoor patio seating by the outside private pool at the Four Seasons which is much smaller than Mandalay but is also quiet and not crowded at all so it's very pleasant.  \n\nBreakfast here is VERY good with lots of options and very healthy fare - so I was pretty happy about that because usually there is only one healthy option and the rest is bad but it was a healthy mix of both.\n\nI tried their healthy sampler which had some carrot/orange juice, a carrot blueberry whole wheat muffin, some quinoa muesli and some yogurt with berries.  It was DELICIOUS.  Best part was their fresh warm muffin - I adored it and ended up ordering it a few more times to have with my other breakfast choices.  My husband ordered their s'mores french toast and, while I usually dislike french toast, I ate some of his and loved it.  \n\nWe got their weekend breakfast buffet one day and enjoyed it very much - at around $40 a person it's fairly pricey but everything at the Four Seasons is (or in Vegas for that matter) so we went ahead.  The buffet also had some healthy options (tons in fact) and the standard fare like eggs, waffles, etc.  I liked that they had scones with lemon cream, mini chicken and waffles, a fresh omelet bar, a fresh mini donut bar, and tons of fresh fruits and pastries.  Very nice buffet with options to please any palette.  \n\nWe stopped in and had a nice lunch out on the patio one afternoon where I ordered their Salmon salad and enjoyed it very much - it was light and healthy with fresh ingredients.  My husband ordered a Bison burger I believe and I tasted it - also very good. \n\nAll in all - we very much enjoyed this restaurant and will likely eat here again when staying in Vegas for our next trip."

            "review": "Very good food and really nice atmosphere. We dropped in for a mid-week lunch and sat outside. Our waitress Kieu (\"Q\") was friendly and happy to give us some recommendations. The Veranda has a nice lunch menu with everything from pizza, pasta, entree salads and sandwiches. I started with a glass of wine which Kieu poured from the actual bottle which is a nice touch. \n\nWe ordered the gorgonzola fries to start. I chose the Charlie Palmer steak sandwich and my mom and other half both went with the Sin City burger. The Sin city is a wagyu burger with white cheddar, bacon, avocado and a side of truffle parmesan fries. The steak sandwich was a NY strip with arugula and steak fries. \n\nThe chips were house made and described as being served with a  gorgonzola \"fondue\". As delicious as the chips were there needed to be more cheese. After the first few chips the rest had no cheese on them. \n\nThe burgers and steak sandwich arrived a short time after.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the bread was super fresh. The steak fries were a little too thick and dry. I absolutely loved the smaller fries served with the burgers though. They were crispy and loaded with truffle and parmesan flavor. Next time I will ask for those instead of the steak fries. \n\nUnfortunately the food runner mixed up the burgers and my mom and other half got each others (one medium, one rare). They figured it out after a few bites so we flagged down Kieu. She was very apologetic and asked if we wanted it remade, which my other half did. She told us the chef said it would be 15 minutes so he decided not to wait. The burger itself was large and they both said the flavor was delicious. We somehow had a little room for dessert so ordered a piece of chocolate cake to share. \n\nAs we were waiting, Tessa, The Veranda manager came by to apologize for the burger mix up. Tessa was a delight to speak to and obviously cares about her guests happiness. She was kind enough to comp us the cake which was a very nice gesture. Overall we had a wonderful lunch and plan on returning for their weekend brunch."

            "review": "Let me start off by saying I was expecting more from Verandah at the Four Seasons.\n\nWhen the hostess was walking us to our table, I noticed mini donuts sitting out and asked the hostess what they are for. She said they are for our guests and you can take one. I took two mini glazed donuts, even though, I did not like the fact that they were sitting out. It looked tacky and for The Four Seasons I expected a classier way of serving them like having them on a tray with serving tongs or keeping them in the back and having the waiter or hostess ask if we would like complimentary mini donuts. \n\nAs soon as I sat down at the table outside I noticed it was dirty. There was a sticky red substance on the table and crumbs all over the table, chairs, and the surrounding floor. For the prices that they charge here, attention to detail can not be overlooked. While looking over the menu, I asked the waiter to bring over some bread and balsamic. The balsamic was low quality and tasted very bitter, the container looked like it had not been cleaned for quite a while and was just refilled before the first shift of the day. I decided on the summer spaghetti and my friend chose the Tuscan chicken salad. \n\n25 minutes later our food had not come out and it was hot as hell outside so we asked to be moved to the inside. As soon as we sat down we noticed it was just as dirty inside as it was outside. The table next to us had dried food particles on the side of it, booths were falling apart, and dust was all in the crevices. \n\nSummer spaghetti- not well seasoned had to add salt, crushed red peppers, Parmesan to make it passable\n\nChicken salad- lettuce tasted like paper towels, ingredients were low quality\n\nI called over the manager to tell him how filthy the restaurant was and that my expectations were not being met. He proceeded to write everything down on a note pad and thanked me for my feedback. I ended up sending the chicken salad back and we shared the pasta. The manager sent over a few complimentary desserts- Nutella cupcake, cherries, Panna cotta with kiwi gelatin on top? Both the Nutella cupcake and Panna cotta were amateur. The cake part of the cupcake tasted worse than a store bought mix and the Nutella buttercream frosting was lacking any type of bold flavor. The cherries were not even good, I felt like the manager just threw together a dessert without thinking it through. \n\nWhen the bill came I noticed I was charged for the chicken salad. I told the waiter I should not be charged for an item I didn't eat. The manager comes back out and says you ate half the salad, and I said we tried the salad and realized it was not up to par. He ended up comping the meal for our sub par experience.\n\nI hope to see improvement after the remodel is done because this restaurant needs to be refreshed and professionally detailed. \n\nI appreciated the manager comping the meal and bringing out a few desserts. However, after the lack of attention to detail at Verandah, The Four Seasons in Las Vegas is not what it's cracked up to be."

LET ME SAY !! the BRUNCH here is FABULOUS.\n\nHere's why : they have a donut making station. Where they make little round donuts - with a hole, but any way you want. FRESH FRESH FRESH and mini, so you can pretend you aren't getting THAT FAT.\n\nThey had these guava pancakes that had a slightly pink tinge, and sound crazy but were very moist and almost creamy. The usual suspects are present - corned beef hash, eggs benedict, french toast, eggs, potatoes, 2 kinds of bacon etc... Some other not so typical stuff also, little personal tins of egg white frittata with veggies, veggie quiche mini's. Lots of nice pastries and bagels, cold cereal, fruit etc...\n\nI think the price was about $40. AYCE. No alcohol included. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice. You can sit indoor or outdoor by the pool. This restaurant is inside the Four Seasons. Service is always good. Good OJ, the kind that tastes like a real orange. YUM."

            "review": "I have to say Verandah at The Four Seasons Hotel offers the best weekend breakfast/brunch in town. I personally think it's better than Bouchon and Mozen. It's $37 per person with buffet style and serves between 7am - 1pm. If weather is nice, I strongly recommend to have outdoor seating by pool. You can customize your own omelet with smoked salmon, chicken, ham, mushroom, spinach, tomato, bell pepper, Jalapeno, Swiss cheese, Cheddar cheese at omelet station. They also have a donut station, which you can customize your own donuts with different dipping sauces & toppings. It's fun to see how bakery chef prepares those mini donuts right in front of you. Everything I had today was pretty good. (Scones, mini banana pancakes, banana parfaits, caramelized peach with ricotta cheese, smoked salmon omelet, vegetable quiche, fresh squeezed watermelon & berry juicy, and even roasted coffee!!) Everyone from hostess, waitress to bus boy is really friendly providing Four Seasons quality services. One more thing I would like to mention is all pastries were not drown in tons of sugar compare to most of other places. They made me feel less guilty and healthier to enjoy their lovely Sunday brunch ^__^"

            "review": "Mismanaged expectations.  From a promotion for a the prix fixe dinner, we dressed appropriately for \"The Four Seasons\" - and what a mistake!  The Verandah is a \"dolled-up\" buffet room, that's probably great for patio dining by the pool, but hardly for dinner.  While the wait staff was friendly and attentive, the service was out of step and not up to \"The Four Seasons\" standards.  After being asked for our water order (we chose Pellegrino), bread was dropped off unceremoniously without any suggestion of butter.  We guess 'everyone' prefers olive oil.  The bread was not at all warm - merely room temperature and poorly presented.  When the butter was delivered - a really long wait - over 5 minutes - it arrived cold and hard - straight from the fridge.  Off to a bad start.\n\nThe first course was a warm ricotta cheese with tomato - quite pleasant.  By now the sparkling wine included with the meal was delivered and acceptable.  The second course was supposed to be a seafood gnocchi but tasted like grammar school paste.  Huge miss!  Third course was 'snapper' (hard to tell) with whipped potato - not bad, but this is a $100 place setting.  Fourth course was short rib with polenta - very so-so.  The desert course was an 'ok' mouse cake with a dollop of ice cream, topped off with coffee.  The entire expereince just felt very \"regular\".  Here's the juicy bit.\n\nMy wife and I dress up for dinner about once a month as a treat.  On this evening, she wore a stunning dress and her best Jimmy Choo pumps - absolutely smashing!  While we wear jeans and shorts when appropriate - we're the last people would call snobs - we were really put off by the fellow at the next table in a \"wife beater\" T-shirt.  Where's the dress code for The Four Seasons during the dinner hour?\n\nWe've not tried the Charlie Palmer steak house adjacent to The Verandah, but doubt a visit any time soon.  Perhaps that's the hierarchy of dining at this hotel - The Verandah for the pool crowd.  With so many terrific alternatives on and off The Strip, The Verandah is relinquished to the back water."

The real star of the evening, though, was the drinks, particularly this drink called the Desert Rose that consisted of Belvedere Citrus vodka and hibiscus syrup.  Absolutely delicious and hands down, one of the best drinks I've ever had.\n\nOn an aside, I had written down the ingredients for the Desert Rose, but accidentally misplaced them.  I e-mailed the Four Seasons and within a few days, they had e-mailed me not only the ingredients, but the directions on how to make the drink.  This is stellar service and it was much appreciated.\n\nWhile I probably wouldn't make this a regular place to visit for dinner, I could see coming here for drinks or special occasions."

We tried both of each course, for optimal variety. Although portions appeared on the small side, this perception was deceptive. Each bite was a powerhouse of flavors, we were quite satisfied. We never had to leave the hotel for meals, a reflection of quality in this competitive restaurant town, rather than convenience or laziness.\n\nThe kids that I've witnessed have always been well-behaved, probably experienced and comfortable in the atmosphere of Four Seasons.

As someone who has always bragged up the Four Seasons this was highly disappointing. I am usually one that always gives restaurants two tries before I give up on them, pretty sure I don't feel the need to return or recommend them.  After writing the manager and not receiving a response, they are obviously not worried about it. I can say the food was good, as it should be for $50 a person on a get it yourself brunch. I did have to pass on the scrambled eggs though they had the appearance of something from a motel 6 free buffet.  The fact that they couldn't refill a drink or clear dirty dishes is certainly beyond ridiculous. Thirty minutes to take care of the check was also on the ridiculous side. Honestly I've had better service at any other restaurant in Vegas and being a local that's quite a few. Sorry Four Seasons you've dropped a few notches in my book."

Bomb diggity.  $40/pp.  Just go. \n\nMy boo surprised me with a breakfast buffet and from the minute we walked in, I felt we were treated like high rollers.  \nVerandah is situated inside the Four Seasons and right beside the pool.  Should you wish to people watch and bask in the sun, then the verandah of the Verandah (see what I did there?) would be your ideal spot.  Otherwise, I'd suggest you bathe in the luxury of elegant decor, white linens, and a relaxed eat-at-your-own-pace ambiance of  their indoor dining area.  \nYou are not obligated to partake in their breakfast buffet, as there was separate menu  that featured the usual breakfast fare.  \nAfter being seated by the friendly hostess, our server took our drink orders.  We then galloped to the buffet area to feast!\n\nThe buffet was relatively small Eggs Benedict, eggs, and bacon.  I was surprised with the quality of Eggs Benedict.  I'm not a connoisseur of EB, but damn.  The biscuit was crunchy!  I did not expect it to have texture if it had been sitting in a food heater/water bath all morning.  That was a good surprise.\n\nI'm not a fan of drip coffee, but damn, even the coffee was good.  \n\nSome stand-out items were the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, peppered bacon, French Toast with berry compote, vanilla bread pudding, and assorted pastries like blueberry scones with lemon curd.  Yummy in my tummy!\n\nAlso Included in the buffet menu was custom-made omelettes.  I ordered mine made with spinach and other standard accoutrements you would put in any omelette.  One thing I MUST note  was my spinach was cooked PERFECTLY in the omelette.  In all other omelettes I have had that included the green, leafy powerhouse, the spinach had been cooked into nothing and offered no *textural* contrast to my omelette.  Oh, but at the Verandah, you see, my omelette was perfection! \n\nAnother area that exceeded my expectations was the efficacy and professionalism of the staff.    My coffee was constantly refilled and other servers (including our own) periodically asked about our food and our experience without being too invasive or too fake.  \nI was having trouble cutting the biscuit of my Eggs Benedict with a dull dinner knife and our server noticed and handed me a steak knife so that I could cut through the biscuit (I couldn't, but I much appreciated the gesture).\nIt just seemed that everyone we encountered was genuinely interested in our dining experience!  That's always a plus for me and makes for a glowing review on Yelp."

There's a station with traditional breakfast items (eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, potatoes, bread pudding, pancakes, etc.).  Other stations include: breads and pastries, fruit and cheeses, and desserts.  Smoked salmon was the only seafood available and there were no carved meats, or other more impressive items that you might expect at this price point.

Veranda does not belong in a Four Seasons Resort.\n\nI don't mind spending upwards of $40 for breakfast just to enjoy an hour in a tranquil setting away from the the casino.  However the lackluster food and service in the past year have left me wondering why I continue to revisit the Veranda.\n\nFood: the menu fails to change with the seasons. The same eggs Benedict with tomato hollandaise and asparagus has remained for the past six months. Something that shouldn't happen considering asparagus is a seasonal veg.  On my most recent visit, hash browns were stone cold in the middle and tasted previously frozen. The poached eggs in the Benedicts, overcooked with almost no liquid yolk, and simple whole-wheat toast, limp, barely toasted, and dripping with butter. A single choice of fruit preserves on the table.\n\nService: the biggest disappointment.  First, the restaurant prides itself on having servers address you by name (Your name is passed from the hostess to your lead server). On one occasion, my guest was addressed with my name (perhaps Asians all look alike), on another, even I didn't recognize the pronunciation of my name.  Seriously, what's wrong with just saying \"good morning\"?\n \nSecond, on my last two visits, I had to ask for more coffee. The server simply brought a pot to the table. It wasn't until I attempted to pour my own refill that a second server rushed over and insisted I allow her to pour.\n \nFinally, on my most recent visit, I wanted to do a room charge at an MGM property. Was told by the server I should complete the room charge form but Mandalay Bay was not part of the Four Seasons.  She needed to get special approval to complete the transaction.  Proceeded to wait.  Finally after watching her chatting animatedly with other employees for 20 minutes and waiving off the busser I flagged down to get her attention, I walked out.  I made the extra step of personally visiting the front desk to verify that in fact the room charge was completed.\n\nYes, these complaints are first world problems and honestly trivial but when paying $80-$100 for breakfast for two, and knowing the impeccable service and attention to detail  usually given at a Four Seasons Resort, this was quite a shock.\n\nI don't see another visit anytime soon."

The indoor seating almost reminds me an island resort's restaurant... and the outdoor seating is beatiful and relaxing by the Four Season's quiet pool. The place has a Mediterranean garden feel to it which is really wonderful. Their food is a bit mediocre as far as Four Seasons dining goes but absolutely always hits the spot with a nice array of salads, sandwiches and other usual hotel restaurants offerings.

This isn't something I'd do often, but if you are into tea parties you should try it at least once. \n\nThe tea service setup is fun (but I was sad that the waiters were not wearing white gloves or anything; for that kind of per-person price they should've been playing it up like a scene out of \"Downton Abbey\") and semi-casual. There were lots of older socialite types as well as a few couples. You can opt to add a glass of champage or just go with the straight tea. \n\nThe tea menu is good, but I was sad that they were out of two of the teas (of course the one I wanted!) the day we were there. They should try harder to always have all the teas listed on hand; that really set a downer tone from the get-go. \n\nWe were presented with a tiered tower of treats: freshly baked scones on top, savory bites in the middle, then sweets on the bottom. The scones were INSANELY delicious. I wish we had a whole tower of just those. The clotted cream and preserves served alongside were some of the most delicious I've had anywhere, even in local tea houses in rural England.\n\nThe savory bites were good but not great. While they tasted freshly baked, some of the textures of the uniform pastry shells screamed \"premade.\" The sweets were the worst of the bunch; we took just one or two bites of most of those. \n\nThe staff said they do change up the goodies that are offered, so you may have different edibles than we had. The staff was prompt, courteous, and kept our teapots filled with hot water.\n\nOne suggestion I'd have for the tea service: it would be nice if the restaurant tried to make it feel more special and/or romantic. Maybe have some live music or play classical music or curtain off a special area of the restaurant. A lot of ambiance was lost with the television over the bar blaring an NBA basketball game. \n\nThe tea service requires a 24 hour's notice reservation, so make sure you call ahead or stop by to avoid disappointment."

            "review": "I just came back from my second meal at Verandah since they got a new executive chef, Antonio Minichiello, who started last September.  The first visit, I had the $45 prix fixe menu (not sure if they're still offering the same deal) -- salad, salmon, and a very interesting dessert (cow milk fritters with fresh strawberries and strawberry sorbet), all excellent.  I'm forgetting the specifics now, but all in all, it was a terrific meal for much less than you'd expect to pay at the Four Seasons.\n\nI ordered a la carte tonight. First, the special appetizer, fried softshell crab in a pear prosecco sauce.  I was a bit disappointed at first because the crab was on the small side, but then I remembered that this ain't the Cheesecake Factory, where just one appetizer could easily be dinner for two Europeans.  In other words, appetizers shouldn't get you full, or anywhere near, since most of your meal is still to come.  After a couple of decades in Boston, I had plenty of softshell crab, and this was the best ever:  light and crispy, not the slightest bit oily, with a sauce that complemented the crab instead of overwhelming it.  I had a second appetizer, capesante, seared scallops in two different sauces - rhubarb compote and aioli - both very good, although I found the scallops a bit salty (granted, I have a low salt taste).  For a main course, I tried the house special pasta: La Pasta Cotta Nel Vaso (pasta cooked in a jar, in case your Italian's rusty) -- artichoke pasta with scallops, calamari, langoustine, shrimp, tomato, and basil -- and yes, it is actually cooked in a mason jar.  You're actually supposed to eat it from the jar, although they do give you a pasta dish if you want to partake more conventionally.  I was a bit dubious, but the dish was superb.  Most important, the pasta was done perfectly al dente, not the watery overcooked mess that most restaurants serve.  All the seafood was also cooked perfectly, so that everything was tender and flavorful.  Cooking it all in a mason jar seems like a gimmick, but there must be something to it because all the flavors combine beautifully.  For dessert, I went a bit crazy and ordered the dessert for two:  tiramisu in a cr\u00e8me anglaise, topped by 3 scoop(lets) of gelato in a caramelized wafer bowl, topped by a county fair-sized fluff of orange cotton candy.  My eyes popped when I saw this huge dessert coming my way, but fortunately, most of the mass is just the cotton candy.  The tiramisu was excellent, as were all three flavors of gelato (white espresso, rum crunch, butter pecan - all made in house).  The caramelized wafer bowl was buttery, just the right sweetness, and perfectly crispy, and even the cotton candy was surprisingly good.\n\nOthers have criticized Verandah for its poor service, but I experienced only top-notch service both nights I went.  My server knew every single item on the menu down cold.  He, along with the food runner and assistant server (actual title?), were terrific.  Service was of equal caliber during my first visit as well.  Chef Minichiello has made Verandah the best Italian restaurant in town, in my opinion.  With a great staff and a beautiful room, it's one of the best restaurants in town, period.  Oh, and it's not nearly as expensive as you would think for being in the Four Seasons."

My husband was so upset that he spent $35 on the brunch buffet and didn't like anything besides the donuts! I had the huevos rancheros and it was mediocre at best. As for the service, the waiters approached about 3 times to take our order in the first minute we sat down, before we had a chance to read the menu, and then didn't come back for a while. My husband used 3 plates to visit the buffet, and not one plate was cleared until I stood up to leave. It was a complete disappointment and I would only recommend going for perhaps a morning coffee, just for the beautiful setting."

And suddenly, we were here at Verandah, led out onto a peaceful & quiet patio, overlooking a nice garden and pool and it felt glorious.  It was perfect for a relaxing, 5-course dinner.  No fake blue sky painted on the ceilings here.  No echos of mall shopping.  We could actually carry a conversation without having to yell, and we could sit back and enjoy the fresh air and sunshine on a gorgeous open air patio.  Why aren't there more restaurants like this on The Strip?  Of the five courses, the majority of them were very tasty and the meal included champagne, coffee and dessert.

That being said, the quality of the food and the setting could not be better.  It's located in the Four Seasons hotel and has a very tropical feel.  They have outdoor seating on gorgeous patio furniture, with palm trees and misters that create a lush and humid environment.  The buffet does not have the plethra of selections that you would find at Bellagio or others, but they are not going for the cheesy Vegas buffet experience where you wait in line for hours and gorge yourself.  The food is beautiful- a huge selection of pastries including plain and almond croissants, pain au chocolat, fruit danishes, cinnamon rolls, brioche, muffins, and lovely coffee cakes.  They have bagels with lox and all the fixings.  There is fresh fruit plated in glass cups (greek yogurt and granola parfaits, macerated citrus segments, fresh seasonal berries, etc).  There is a made-to-order egg and omelette station and about 10 chaffing dishes with eggs benedict, breakfast meats, vegetarian quiches and fritattas, cheese blintzes, and a delicious bread pudding.  Best of all, there is a donut station with a chef preparing hot cake donuts by the minute and glazing them with icing, chocolate, coconut, nuts, etc.  They are small, crisp, delicate and delicious.  Your brunch is served with their fresh juice of the day (which is usually a blend of melons and berries).  They use iced tea ice cubes in their iced tea, a major plus in my book.  Whenever we have peeps in town or it's a special occasion, this is the first place we head to.  Brunch at Verandah is not to be missed."

I loved the way he cooked the fish, one of the best fish dishes I had in Vegas.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you are in Vegas and don't want to have an overpriced dinner."

I'd come back but I'll have to work a little to be able to afford it first.  I guess you can't really expect anything to be inexpensive at a Four Seasons, can you."

It does continue on with that slightly tropical, slightly Asia and beautiful resort dcor from the mandalay. theme.  there was indoor and outdoor seating available overlooking the pool.  the tables and chairs were of rattan amidst the wood tones around the restaurant.   We started with tuna sampler of tuna tartare (ahi poke), blackened sashimi (seared tuna) and spicy tuna maki roll (spicy tuna roll)...good but unimpressive.  We also had the tasty and crispy crab cakes on a jicama-green papaya-mango slaw (this is a definite recommendation...i just love that slaw).   my friend had the original san francisco crab louis, which was loaded with hella lumps of crab meat.  i had the nioise Salad with grilled hawaiian rare tuna (these were meaty bastards that resembled slightly rare steak with a shiny sheen under different lights), haricot vert, roasted potatoes, cherry tomatoes, capers, and big chunks of red and green olives sprayed with vinager.   We also ordered garlic and parmesan fries, sweet potato fries, which both needed a better dip than ketchup.  (note the sweet potato fry comment on my pop's review...totally better over at pop's.)  my friend could not stop raving about the macaroni and cheese (sounds like somebody else out there...Ed M.)  and wholly crap!!!  it was damn good, in fact i took some back to the office and eating it right now.  this cheese is just extremely creamy, but what I love about it is the garlic toast sprinkles all over the top.  when you mix it all up, every bite you'll taste the creamy buttery cheese, the  softness of the macaroni, crunchy little bits scattered throughout.  we did finish it off with the mini eskimos, roasted nuts and dark chocolate covered vanilla ice cream bars on a stick.  i had to have two!!!\nif i could i would like to give this place 3 and a half stars.  i mean the mini eskimos and crab cakes were good.  i ordered the nicoise salad  because it looked and tasted good, plus i didn't see anything appetizing in the entree section.  it is a good thing b/c i probably wouldnt have had the chance to try the mac and cheese and fries.  both items were side dishes, and they were happy to whip us up an order.  i would like to return here for afternoon tea and then add some more insight to this place...till then..."

Restaurant is thoroughly kid-friendly while not for a second compromising adults' menu choices; also Four Seasons-standard.\n\nWe had breakfast here each day and it was consistent and enjoyable, including both the a la carte menu and the buffet.  Highlights of the buffet on the day I ate include salmon and crab at the omelet bar and a donut bar!\n\nWe had lunch once and it was, for the price especially, remarkable.  The trio of tuna is great, and useful especially as a light lunch if you're going on to something big that night, and we also enjoyed the crab salad.\n\nFinally, we had a nice pre-fix group dinner there one night.  Some quite creative items as well as a centerpiece meat and fish dishes that were tasty, just the right size in portion, and otherwise fully on target.  Nothing that really leaped out and demanded your attention to the extent that a fifth star would be in order, though."

My sister made reservations for 12:30 brunch and we showed up a half hour early and they were able to accommodate us (there were very few people there). The valet parking is free which was nice. We decided to sit outside since the weather was nice. We walked through the dining room and saw all the delicious food available through the buffet. We got seated in a remote corner outside. \n\nWhen we sat down, we learned that the buffet was $40 (and even more if we wanted mimosas with it). For BRUNCH. I mean, yes it's Vegas, everything is overpriced and that's a common price. But this place is not in a highly trafficked area and is further south on the Strip, so I can't imagine why they think they should be charging that amount. We went out of our way to drive there when we could've easily found a better meal for the same price in or near our hotel (Cosmopolitan).\n\nWe decided to forgo the buffet and order lunch. We first ordered mimosas ($14 each! They certainly were not that good). A guy (not our waiter) came around offering coffee which, at any other restaurant, is complimentary, especially when we hadn't requested it and the cups they used were tiny espresso cups. When we got the bill, we saw they charged us $6 EACH - for coffee none of us even drank and was cold. $18 for nothing. So absurd. \n\nMy sister ordered sushi and was very happy with it. I believe it was tuna. My friend ordered a salmon sandwich that she also enjoyed, and that came with sweet potato fries. My meal, however, was severely lacking. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich. The pesto aioli was too goopy and thick and not tasty at all (and I consider myself a pesto connoisseur). It came with tomato jam, which I had never tried before, and found it was too sweet (I would have preferred regular tomato or even sun dried tomatoes). I substituted mozzarella instead of the provolone which made it better. But overall the sandwich was just \"ok\" and I found myself scraping a lot of the toppings off and just eating the chicken. My sweet potato fries were BURNED. The waitress came over right as I said to my friends \"these are burned\" and pushed them aside and she didn't say a word, didn't offer to bring more... nothing. \n\nThe bill came - $125 for this mediocre lunch (before tip), including the overpriced coffees that we never ordered.  Considering how much they charge and the quality of the food, I would suggest finding another place for brunch (I can't speak for the buffet or breakfast). But if I'm going to be nickel and dimed, I at least want a good meal and decent drinks. I would not recommend Verandah."

Others at the table had the bloody mary and were going on and on about how great it was so I assume it was delicious, but I'm not a big bloody mary drinker. It took a while for the food to get to me because I ordered early with three of our friends, and then the other four came about 10-15 minutes after us.

Valet is complimentary if dining at one of the restaurants and the valet is quick. The ambiance of The Four Seasons is so lovely and has a much calmer setting than the other hotels on the Strip. \n\nVeranda isn't a far walk from where you'll leave your car with the valet. Inside The Four Seasons it's just a left and then a walk to the end of a short hall. \n\nOur group decided to go with the Sunday brunch buffet and it was a good decision. There were several areas of food to choose from. The hot food area had the usual breakfast foods like eggs, bacon, pancakes, and oatmeal with all of the fixings. There were also special items like chicken and waffles, benedicts, mini breakfast burritos, blintzes (!), and their signature bread pudding. There is an omelet station for those that prefer a customized egg option. In the other sections they have plenty of pastries, yogurts, fresh fruit, meats, cheeses, and delicious mini donuts. They even have a little table with kid friendly foods like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (sans crust).\n\nI really enjoyed the food offered at the buffet. My favorite items were the mini donuts, the bread pudding, and the chicken and waffles. The waffle in the chicken and waffles had jalapenos in it which really kicked the flavor up a notch. Everyone will find something they can enjoy for breakfast. \n\nThe pricing for the breakfast buffet was similar to what you'd pay for Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan or Bacchanal at Caesars . I think those buffets offer a little more food options, but you can't beat the ambiance of brunch at The Four Seasons. Brunch here is definitely more relaxing and has nicer ambiance than other brunch options in town. I can definitely see coming back here for brunch."

The meatball appetizer was out of this world and my lobster risotto was to die for! \n\nThank y'all so much for turning a bad evening into a great one. Your hospitality, environment, wait staff and food selection was the best I had during my trip. Rest assured I'll be sending all my friends who visit to y'all's place!!"

The ambiance was great, and the room was beautiful both inside and outside.  We choose to sit outdoors and the view was nice, beautiful trees and their pool in the background.\n\nWe were in town in part for a John Mayer concert, and the music they were playing was, well, John Mayer.  If that's your kind of thing it was a nice soothing brunch soundtrack.\n\nWe read good things about the brunch buffet, so decided to give it a try.  Everything about Verandah was memorable... except the food.  The buffet selection wasn't special in Vegas terms.  The mini donut station was my favorite part.\n\nWe loved the room, ambiance, location, however the buffet just didn't do it for us."

First off, this place is located in the Four Seasons (self-explanatory).  Second, due to the location of the Four Seasons (it is at the end of the strip) it is a more secluded hotel, and this restaurant is at the corner of the hotel thus making it a nice quiet spot from all the hustling and bustling of Las Vegas.  And lastly, the service as well as all the other desserts and sandwiches are simply top notch.  For example, even though there is an actual reason you need to reserve a spot in advance as they only make enough for the people coming, the staff was nice enough to place an extra order of scones for us to take to go.  They even packed extra jam and devonshire cream after we inquired as to whether or not they sell their jam to the public (which they don't or at least not at this location).  Furthermore, they have a medium size list of teas available, which is more than enough for me as I tend to stick with black tea when I do afternoon teas.  As for the other desserts they got the usual salmon sandwich, vege sandwich, chocolate cake, et cetera...  And yes this place is kind of pricey but really you are in Vegas and in a Four Seasons hotel at that to boot.  \n\nDefinitely my favorite place for afternoon tea.  I always try to at least go every time I go to Vegas but I think their afternoon tea is only on weekdays so call ahead and make your reservation before you go."

Behold my Vegas luck, someone with a group of 14 canceled and we would have a nice semi-private room for our group. Only downside would be that it would be inside. If you have a semi-small group or don't mind waiting, I'd recommend trying to get seated outside on a nice day. It's right next to the Four Seasons pool and seems very relaxing. \n\nSome people in our group ordered a la crate and some got the brunch buffet. Two most impressive contraptions of the meal: the Donut Robot and the fresh peanut butter maker. The donut robot makes donuts by itself and the only need for a human being is to dip the donuts into toppings (but I'd recommend just trying a plain donut fresh). They had an omelette station that had both crab and lobster meat. Traditional breakfast buffet fare including frittatas, bread pudding, lots of fruits and pastries, etc... They also had fresh squeezed juices. \n\nI guess the only negative was the cost. +$40 for the brunch buffet after tax/tip. Being in the Four Seasons hotel, I guess this is to be expected. However, still a reason for a dock of a star. I haven't really eaten at the other casino buffets for breakfast/brunch, so I can't really compare. But I'm fairly certain they're less expensive and might even offer more fare."

For my main entree, I got the braised short rib and that was absolutely delicious. I finished everything under 5 min, and was polishing the plate. \n\nService was good, I sat by the bar and the bartender was super skilled and talented.

There are some that I say are undeniably above the rest and while Veranda may not be one of those select few, it is still incredibly good.\n\nThe setting is great and I don't know if there's a better outdoor seating environment on the strip than overlooking the pool at the Four Seasons. It is a casual restaurant experience which is great for when you roll out of your bed but it also feels like a country club. The prices also reflect that feeling. It is not exuberantly expensive by any means...it is also not IHOP.\n\n-Smores French Toast. Obviously delicious and something that could kill you upon first consumption. Probably worth it though.\n\n-Breakfast Panini. Super good. Won't destroy your stomach but still has a lot of flavor and tastes healthy which is a plus even if it is most likely a lie. Burrata tomatoe spinach pesto eggs etc. It all works.\n\nThe fruit plates and the pastries are also nice and fresh. It's hard to describe the intricacies of a medium to high priced breakfast cafe but you should reasonably know what to expect. I am the kind of person that has never been blown away by breakfast food no matter where it is, except Border Grill but more on that later. For a relaxing breakfast at a cafe it's hard to get better than this."

GROSS. \nWe called over the waitress and showed it to her. She apologized and took it away. It was clearly baked in the bread. \nUnfortunately, the waitress seemed 'annoyed' at us... like it was our fault!! \nShe didn't take the rest of the loaf away.. she leaves it there like we are going to eat more from it!? \nWe had to ask her to get us a fresh loaf of bread... after that she wasn't very attentive for the rest of our meal. I guess we were the problem... so demanding.\n\nAt the end of our meal she brought out 2 mini cupcakes for us to share for 'our trouble'. TACKY. \n\nOur bill was $83 (including tip) for 3 half grilled cheese sandwiches with tiny cups of soup, 3 beverages and 1 LONG piece of hair. \n\nOh, beverages are a rip too. $5 for coffee, ice tea or a diet coke which they serve out of the can at your table.......oh now that's fancy."

It's connected to 4 seasons. We had 3 dishes:\n\nThe margarita pizza (I think that's what it's called) - I thought this one wasn't great, though the girlfriend thought it was the best dish. The bread of the pizza felt a bit too soft, and the sauce plus pizza was lacking. Maybe I'm just being too picky since I'm biased towards NY pizza. \n\nShrimp tacos - these were great, the shrimp was big and fresh, and the lemon and avocado sauce was interesting. I prefer the taco toasted a bit more, but overall I can recommend this dish. \n\nSeafood mac and cheese - This was the highlight of the lunch. They did not skimp on the seafood, with chunks of lobster, scallop and shrimp. I devoured it in minutes. Girlfriend did not enjoy it though, so it may be an acquired taste. \n\nOverall, I give the food a solid 3.

I mention this because she was amazing in accomadating us when we were trying to decide which table to sit at, and oh so sweet!!\n\nThis is where the 5 star experience ends. We waited forever for our waiter, and then waited forever for our drinks, then waited forever for our food. I actually don't mind waiting awhile for food, because I like to savor my cocktail beforehand, but our waiter was pretty inattentive with that, I had to flag him down or remind him to bring us our drinks.\n\nMy hubby ordered bruschetta, soup, and a caesar salad- all very mediocre. They completely forgot to bring him a soup spoon until I got up and asked for one. He ordered the arrabiata pasta (said it was ok, nothing special). I ordered the chef's specialty \"Pasta in a jar', which sounded promising. It arrived around dusk, so I couldn't see the color of the shrimp and seafood so well, but I noticed it felt slimy and squishy in my mouth. I checked it out and the shrimp had a little pink but was mostly grey!! I don't know why I didn't just send it back but instead ate the pasta peices around the undercooked fish instead. It was truly, truly DISGUSTING!! I am hoping I don't get food poisoning from it, but I am sure it is probably flown in fresh daily, so at least there's that.\n\nAlso, I was expecting amazing ambiance, but it was basically like a glorified Tommy Bahama's minus the live music, situated around a swimming pool.

There was only one other table occupied when I arrived but it soon got busy.  My server was Jose and he proved., along with all the staff, to be pleasant, polite, and very efficient!\n\nI ordered 4 things--pear salad, ahi tuna crudo, Penne Tegame, and an apple and fig crostata for dessert.  First I was brought water and quickly the iced tea I ordered.  \n\nThe starter was the pear salad.  Their menu describes it as Bartlet Poached Pear, Spiced Goat Cheese, Endive, Pecans, Porto Dressing.  It was excellent.  The pieces of pear in the endive leaves with the goat cheese was an amazing combination.  The pecans added a texture element that was perfect.\n\nNext up was the crudo of very thinly sliced ahi tuna with balsamic soy dressing and guacamole. An interesting combination with ahi tuna but it worked very well.\n\nFor the main course, I bypassed the signature pasta dish and instead went with the penne Tegame with a spicy Roma tomato and parsley sauce and mozzarella.  The red flecks of pepper could be seen and tasted throughout the dish.  The spiciness was not overwhelming for anyone.  It was excellent.\n\nJose suggested the cannoli for dessert but I chose something different, the warm apple and fig crostata.  It had an orange and vanilla bean reduction/panna cotta gelato.  I am generally not a fan of warm desserts but this was amazing!  Very delicious and an excellent ending to a delightful meal.\n\nService was the best!  My iced tea never got more than an inch down from the top when the glass was refilled.  Plates were removed quickly, and people addressed me by my last name taken from the reservation.  This is what I expect from a Four Seasons restaurant and they didn't fail.  In addition, I received a phone call on the way home because they thought they had found an item I may have left behind.

He walked away.After that a waitress came and asked the same question and we told her the same and she said oh, that's too bad."

Grabbed a poolside table outside, which I am a sucker for, and was pleasantly surprised.  This is a legitimate Italian restaurant...and by that I mean equivalent to a good meal in Italy.  Not Italian American.\n\nTheir signature (veal?) meatballs are really good, super light in texture and lots of flavor.   The Bronzing was great, and cooked to perfection.   Had a couple of pizzas to start out things right, and everyone seemed to love them as well.  I usually snooze through and ice cream desert but they had a really great gelato thing going on  and perfect way to end the meal.  Give how disappointing most meals are in Vegas, Verandah caught me really off guard.\n\nWorth it if you are in the vicinity."

It had asparagus, mushrooms, a few different cheeses, etc.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass, which came with crispy gnocchi, mushrooms, tomatoes and a lobster sauce.  It was so good.  Two of my friends got the tenderloin and another friend tried the crab-crusted scallops.  Everything was amazing.  We also got two desserts, which was actually one too many.  Also, for one friend's brithday, they had given us a little chocolate cake.  Everything was perfect."

I never ever drink red, but his red wine was so smooth with a touch of fruity taste in the end.

The mozzarella was light and it complimented the tomatoes very well \n\nCarpaccio -  oh man, i really really enjoyed this dish. The chef is a genius for including arugulas into this dish! YUM\n\nEntrees: \n\nLampchop : it was very dry :/ my least favorite.. it also came with lots of beans?\n\nLinguine with pesto : it was delicious but very heavy!\n\nMeatballs: it was okay.. \n\nOverall, i really enjoyed their appetizers more than their entrees."

We stayed at Mandalay Bay and it was just a short walk to the this place at Four Seasons Hotel that is on the same territory as Mandalay Bay.\n\n It was a chilly morning and the place was packed inside so were offered to sit at the table outside with a floor heater lamp moved next to us. But you know what? Make sure to sit OUTSIDE as if you sit inside it just feels as a typical restaurant.\n\nService was fantastic: timely and friendly. Place was very clean with people reading newspapers, sipping on orange juices and coffees. If you sit outside, you feel like you are somewhere in Hawaii (palm trees, swimming pool is seen from the terrace).\n\nPrices are reasonable for this level of a restaurant. You can probably spend up to $30/person on a full breakfast. Keep in mind, they have a buffet type of breakfast as well at $35. If you are a small eater, probably you can order off the menu (oatmeal and tea) and it will be less.\n \nThe buffet setting feels very elegant as well. Food looks and smells good; is very fresh and tastes delicious.  The selection is not as huge as in some buffets out there, but it has the staples (scrambled eggs, French toasts, oatmeal, berries, fruit, yogurt, some meat (sausage chicken and pork, bacon), which makes it easy for you to make a selection and not to overeat but still indulge on your favorites.\n\nWant to feel like a royal? Go here on any occasion. It's worth it... but like I said above, make sure to sit outside!\n\nBon Appetite,\nUlyana"

Really wanted to sit outside... but... next time.\n\nThe Brunch... if you opt for the Buffet... it's $35 and includes tea, coffee and juice... we were not that hungry... so we ordered off the a la carte menu.  The buffet is lovely but not Huge and Overwhelming like other hotel buffets.  In fact, from the aromas and the entrees I saw... it looked very appealing and the omelet station was very nice where you can have custom omelets/eggs...  And the Bread / Pastry area made my mouth water... which is why I opted NOT to eat the Buffet... it would have been easy to go Hog Wild with all the good looking eats.\n\nOrdered the Eggs Benedict.... which is served on a round Polenta Cake... I say \"Cake\" because the Polenta was more cake like... sweet and creamy at the same time... (it took the place of the typical starch of the English Muffin)... it came with a nice poached egg and candian bacon on top... you get 2 servings... along with a side of steamed asparagus.\n\nMy mother ordered the Mini Waffles... and while Mini... they were big on taste and very artfully presented.  She got 3... one with berries, one with dried cranberries and one with cinnamon butter.  \n\nOur friend ordered the egg white frittata which came with a side of toaste which came in a basket.\n\nFor a Beverage... I ordered a Bloody Mary.... it's Darn good.... not as good as the one at THE cafe at THE hotel... but definitley Solid.\n\nMom had a Mimosa... she said it was ok.\n\nThe check for the 3 of us... with our 2 alcoholic beverages and 1 coffee was $92 before tip.... this is a bit pricey... but 1) it's the Four Seasons and 2) it's Vegas.\n\nNote... if you order coffee... it's $5.50... personally I think that's a rip off but what do I know."

The highlight was easily the chicken apple sausage, the freshly made doughnuts, fried chicken and waffle and french toast. \n\nThe standard fruits and cured meats, parfaits and yogurts were awesome too. If they wanted to kick up the quality of the cheese selection,  I'd like to suggest brining in Beecher's Flagship cheese from Seattle. Pair this with the cured meats... That would take it to another level, IMO.\n\nThere were 12 of us and we were all really happy with the food. The service was why only 4 stars was given. Took awhile to get someone to refill our drinks. At one point, I even had to search for a server to get refills. If they can tighten that up, they would get that 5th star for sure.\n\nI do plan on returning, for sure and I am looking forward to that for sure!"

Five course meal for a smashing price.\n\nArrived with my pal about 20 minutes pre-reservation to have a drink.  Missed Happy Hour pricing by mere minutes (looks like they offer some really good deals).  Sat at a table about 7 feet from bar.  Not crowded.  We were ignored for almost 15 minutes.  There went any desire to get that bottle of prosecco.  BTW - we were dressed  very nicely and were in PLAIN SIGHT of bartenders and servers.  Not a great start.\n\nFriends joined us - seated on the verandah.  Lovely setting, perfect temp, etc.\n\nMeal was one glass each of sparkling wine and then the five courses.  \n\nOverall it was a very nice meal with great friends.\n\nPros:\nSetting was relaxing and peaceful\nFood was nicely presented and short ribs were melt in your mouth delicious as was gouda fonduta.  I wanted to grab my friends' plates and eat theirs\nBill was crazy low - nice change from everything else in Vegas\n\nCons:\nIndifferent service all around - from oblivious bartending staff to our server(s). Server was not rude or incompetent - just not at level I expected from this venue.\nFood was quite salty and as I love me some sodium - I was fine but we all joked about how puffy and bloated we expected to be the next day.  And we were.\nOne friend had an allergy that she advised server about from the start - they managed to work around it on one item that didn't even mention it as an ingredient but then for dessert - where it was listed - they delivered 4 of same and we had no clue if one of them had been doctored for her.  And no server to ask for clarification.\n\nNot sure if I would go back.  Not a horrible experience but not so outstanding that I can't miss a chance to return."

That alone is worth the overpriced buffet! And let's be honest, we are at Four Seasons here. Did you not expect overpriced? The service was also stellar, which made it easy to go with the 4 versus the 3 star rating. \nMy boyfriend and I went here randomly because we have heard many good things. They offer an a-la-carte menu as well as the buffet. The menu had pretty tempting options like chicken and waffles, and lemon ricotta pancakes, but who passes up the above mentioned in an AYCE setting?! Not me! The buffet was $39, or $51 if you want unlimited mimosas or marys. Also, I must mention their OJ is totally fresh squeezed, or at least tasted so. The buffet included many hot items, meats, eggs, potatoes. But the real winner here was the omelette station and/or the donut station. Chef on hand to whip you up an egg dish of your choice. Love it. I also like all the yogurt, granola, and cheeses. You could taste the quality. \nWe ended up ordering the pancakes, and they were fluffy, moist, and yummy. But not worth $20. I will stick to the buffet next time. \nAlso, I would avoid this place during conventions, I could imagine the tourist taking advantage of a classy buffet such as this."

The room itself isn't too big, but it opens up to the private pool at the resort, making it the perfect setting for lunch.\n\nFour Seasons is known for its legendary service and it really shows here.  They even have a machine which makes ice cubes out of a few of the drinks you order.  That way when the ice melts, it doesn't dilute your drink!  Try that at home and see how impressive you are to your guests ;)\n\nThe lunch is 5-star hands down.  I always get the rib sandwich, which is always cooked to a perfect temperature and just melts in your mouth.  At $18 it's not cheap, but in many ways you pay for the wonderful atmosphere.  I also had the mini Klondike-like pops which are presented really well.\n\nMy dinner here was nothing special and a lot more expensive than lunch.  I had a steak (which I notice isn't on the menu anymore) that wasn't bad, but did not meet my expectations compared to the lunch.\n\nWhen I do come back I am anxious to try the brunch which I heard is the best in Vegas, or enjoy my rib sandwich at lunch!"

The food is all great but nothing to die for.  It is pretty pricey at about 50 dollars a person.  I honestly feel like I can go to Dennys and then Pinkbox Donuts right after and get the same, if not better quality food.  They have a pretty good selection of food but nowhere near other buffets in Vegas that are easily half of the price for brunch.  In comparison, the Belagio brunch buffet is 25 dollars and has a MASSIVE selection of food to choose from.  \n\nVeranda brunch has a fresh donut bar, cereal, fried chicken and waffles, pancakes, eggs, omelettes, and a variety of pastries.  \n\nI still love this place for the ambience but food selection doesn't give you enough bang for your buck in my opinion."

Server was not attentive, $14 Mimosas served in a tiny skinny champagne flute, the orange juice was not even fresh, it was from a bottle but they will lie to you because I asked if it was fresh and I was told that yes it was, then I asked if it was freshly squeezed on the premises and was told that actually not they get it bottled - why the bs?! If OJ is bottled it's pasteurized NOT FRESH, and I could definitely taste that it wasn't fresh. The Frittata ($18) was a very small serving and completely flavorless, even the accompanying veggies were bland. We ended up paying $140 for a simple breakfast for 2. We expected the high prices since it's the Four Seasons, however it was a total let down, we didn't expect the Mimosas to be $14 - what a joke."

The BF got eggs, bacon and toast. The typical and he said it was tasty. I got the Quatro, a small Gluten free waffle, scrambled egg whites with asparagus and pesto, grapefruit segments in agave syrup and a carrot juice shooter. The waffle was surprisingly good and who'd know that it was gluten free...no one! The egg whites were light and fluffy and very flavorful with the pesto. The carrot juice was very refreshing. \n\nOur server was great, my coffee was always full and it seemed when I went to pour my coffee he was right there behind me to stop me and did it for me.\n\nI look forward to my next visit for brunch and am hoping that all the awesome little stations we saw are the norm, I know some are but I have a feeling there may have been some additional ones for the occasion. I shall find out soon enough!"

My friend and I made reservations just to be on the safe side, I mean who knows how busy a restaurant may or may not be on Sunday morning (hint:  don't worry if you DIDN'T make reservations for Sunday breakfast).  \n\nAt first I thought we were going to be late because Las Vegas Blvd was closed for the marathon and so the police were diverting traffic elsewhere, in this case we made a u-turn and went back in the opposite direction we came from.\n\nThankfully we made it on time to for our 8am reservation.  One of the best things I've come to appreciate about Verandah is its location AWAY from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  Since there isn't a casino in the Four Seasons, guests and visitors alike can enjoy the peace and serenity this restaurant has to offer.  And besides this tranquility, their service is just simply impeccable as well.  Everyone from the hostess to the servers make you feel very welcome and treat you like you're one of the Ocean's 11.\n\nBut now let's talk about the most important meal of the day:  Breakfast.\nAlthough there were other items on the menu that seemed appealing, as well as the buffet, we didn't deter from our mission and ordered our corned beef and pastrami hash.  Well, good things come to those who wait and this certainly was well worth waiting for.  Simply put:  One of the best breakfast meals I've ever had.\n\nBottom Line:  Peaceful.  Quiet.  Great Service.  Fantastic Breakfast."

It was my first time having afternoon tea service so I didn't have anything to compare it to but can say that I liked it.  First of all, it was so cute and girly as there were several parties of mothers and their young daughters that afternoon.  What a fun idea for an outing!  As for the tea and food, overall it was all very good.  I asked the waiter if he could suggest something fruity for me and really liked what he picked out.  (I'm pretty sure it was the Mountain Berry Tisane.)  The sandwiches and scones/spread tasted great!  Must admit I wasn't too crazy over their dessert, though.  Some of it was actually dry.\n\nThe next day we came back for breakfast and ate out by the pool.  It was a hot day but clouds and misters helped keep us cool.  The atmosphere was amazing!  Totally recommend eating out there.  The food was average.  Not the best breakfast food I've had but not the worst either.  (Surprising but restaurants can actually do bad breakfast food!)  It was also pretty expensive, maybe $30 for my order.  But then again it's the Four Seasons and you're paying for atmosphere as well.  I got The American - eggs, hash brown, choice of meat, bread, and juice.  I forgot what juice I had but whatever it was it was so delish and refreshing!  \n\nI really enjoyed both of my visits so four stars for Verandah!"

I was wondering if I might of missed something because the food was about as good as a regular breakfast buffet at a sub-par venue.  The outside venue is nice but.... Maybe people don't get out much in Vegas because there are way better places to eat a brunch buffet.  The Buffet at Caesars and The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan are way better for around the same price.  There were five people in our party and one had a birthday and the total was $210.00 after tax and before tip.  My son said Mom you should gave me the $200.00 and went to eat at Sunrise Cafe.  Wow now I know how rich folks get taken advantage off.  I'll be eating at the other fore-mentioned buffets before I come back here.  One note I will say is that we could have just ordered of the menu and it would have probably been cheaper.  So I cannot review it as a regular restaurant FYI."

Bouchon will always be my #1 in my heart, but Verandah has always been a favorite of mine for many years.\n\nFOOD: The first time I ate at Verandah was back in 08' for Mother's Day. As a teenager, fine dining lunch was the only thing I could afford. Over the years, I've kissed goodbye the lobster eggs benedict at breakfast and the only salmon burger in Vegas I'll eat. The salmon was always flavorful and perfectly cooked. If I'm paying a mini-fortune for a burger, I expect it to be prepared the right way. The current menu offers all the classics which they do extremely well. The corned beef has--yummy! But as a fine dining restaurant, I would like to see a little more character and diversity--something unique to Verandah that will make me itch to come back to eat.\n\nDINING: If the weather allows, DO sit outside. The patio area is absolutely amazing on a beautiful day. Its upscale and luxurious but you get the amazing view of the pool. They have big sunbrellas and adorable wicker chairs to lounge around and enjoy your meal--classy! There's also plenty of space between you and the next table so you don't need to worry about being cramped or eavesdropping. The interior is just as nice. \n\nWhenever I come here, I get that relaxed, laidback vibe but I still feel fabulous. This place is perfect for having a nice meal with friends or someone you're trying to impress. If your into American food classics--you'll certainly enjoy this place."

The brunch keeps getting better and it seems like they add more food each time. \n\nWe always sit outside by the pool. This year they offered the normal brunch foods inside. Outside, there was a hot dog/Philly cheesesteak station, pizza station, taco cart, meats, etc. The only bad thing I could say about their food is that the sushi wasn't good. But when is sushi at a brunch ever good? Rice is cold and it just kinda sits out. So that's not a real complaint.\n\nStaff came around offering non-alcoholic sangria in plastic bags which I thought was so cute. I didn't like the taste but it was a neat idea. There was also Las Vegas distillery & brewery there on Father's Day to offer tastings!\n\nI love this place. We will come back every year for the mothers/day Father's Day brunch even though it's a bit pricey. $80 per adult, and I believe my 3 year old was like $16. He didn't eat much. Forgot to mention the infamous donut station; freshly fried and dipped to your liking!! My son was all about it.\n\nService is top notch. Food is great."

Also, their iced tea is the BEST and comes with iced tea ice cubes, so when they melt, they don't dilute the tea. And no packet sugar/sweetener here, replaced by simple syrup. Fancy!\n\nI went there recently for dinner. I planned to meet a friend for lunch but she had to cancel at the last minute. I had been looking forward to it for days, so I was bummed and my kind hubby offered to take me there for dinner (one of the many reasons why I love him, lol).\n\nDinner was great! Ordered the fritto misto (calamari) to start. Fried perfectly and accompanied by a yummy marinara sauce. I had the branzino for my entree, which was delicious. It came with whipped potatoes but I substituted rice (see 2nd paragraph). A side order of truffle potatoes had just enough truffle flavor - many places claim to have truffle _____ but when you get it, you can't even taste the truffle. Not so here.\n\nMini ice cream bars for dessert wrapped up a fantastic meal. Note: my first choice was the chocolate souffl\u00e9, but it takes 15 minutes to bake."

The breakfast menu offers simple American favorites - pancakes, French toast, waffles, hash - plus a couple of ethnic dishes, such as huevos rancheros. Lunch gets a little more ambitious, and at dinner time the menu switches to an Italian theme.\n\n**The Atmosphere\nColors are mostly a range of browns, with lots of wood. Seating is available both indoors and outdoors; while I sat indoors, outdoor seating looked very nice. Overall, the atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed.\n\nService was friendly and efficient. I can't describe this very well, but I had a good feeling about the restaurant. Everything just worked smoothly.\n\n**The Meal\nI chose an often recommend dish: corned beef and pastrami hash, two eggs, and crisp potatoes. It started out with a layer of finely shredded potatoes - actually more like thin spaghetti than shreds - fried crisp. Next, a thick layer of hash. Lastly, two eggs, any style; I chose scrambled.\n\nThe hash consisted of a thick layer of finely minced corned beef and pastrami. It was delicious; somehow I managed to finish the gargantuan portion. The crunchy potatoes shreds were an excellent foil to the smooth hash, although they were a challenge to get onto my fork. The only disappointing item was the eggs. They were overly firm and lacking in character. However, that's a minor quibble. I would recommend this dish to anyone.\n\nI also ordered a latte. It came with a small biscuit that was a cross between pistachio biscotti and shortbread. Slightly sweet, it was a good foil to the coffee.\n\n**Summary\nAfter only one meal, I'm ready to place The Verandah on my list of top breakfast spots. Its menu doesn't appeal to me as much as that at my top choice - Bouchon - and the overall feel of the place also isn't quite as inviting, but the combination of excellent food, good service, and pleasing atmosphere make it a winner.\n\n**The Bill\nThe meal was $21, plus tax and tip."

SO exciting for people like my friend and myself who generally dont get to have a lot of options when dining out.  The GF waffles are amazing, and although they use the same GF bread I do at home... it just seemed better.  Fruit was fresh, and juicy.  Chicken Apple sausage was not under/over done, and the mango/guava juice was sweet and not too thin.  Our men had the brunch buffet, and everything looked great from there as well.\n\nOn the room service/poolside menu  food:  All was fabulous!  A great burger on a couple slices of GF bread with avocado and swiss, waffle fries, skillet corned beef and pastrami hash with eggs and shoestring fried potatoes, the large salads, chicken nachos... I would eat every one of these meals again and again!\n\nService was very good, as well.  No complaints."

            "review": "As far as the old system of dining goes, Verandah would probably be considered a \"5-star\" restaurant. Fancy setting, high prices, impeccable service, etc. However in the new food era, it's not just all about being hoity-toity. To get high stars in my book you need to have good food, and provide some form of value proposition. Based on my breakfast at verandah, I'd have to say that A-OK is proper. \n\nFrom entry to exit here, the service is beyond impeccable. They ask your name at the desk and you're subsequently greeted by name by every server that approaches you. Coffee is kept full, and it's white-glove the whole way. The setting is very pleasant - outdoors next to the Mandalay pool system - very elegant. \n\nThe food itself, however, leaves a bit to be desired. It's okay, but for the price it could be a lot better. I sampled a plate of huevos rancheros that cost about as much as a dinner entree would cost at a decent restaurant. $5 for drip coffee is beyond the pale. Overall it was up in the mid-$20's for a simple entree+coffee breakfast. \n\nI guess I'm not someone who is willing to pay all that extra for exclusivity. Coming from Portland I want the food to be exemplary at that price - especially for breakfast, which is notoriously easy to prepare. \n\nIf you want a four-seasons experience, this is your place. If your main goal is good food, you may be able to do better."

Traditional egg and griddle dishes are served as well as the most delicious pastries I've had in a long time. Dare I say best croissants this side of Paris? All I know is the pastry chef in residence here rocks! I also must mention the made-to-order donut bar available during brunch. So amazing, and worth the extra trip to the gym later in the day...\n\nHappy Hour at Verandah boasts select $5 apps and cocktails. My husband and I love the friendly staff and well crafted cocktails. Go between 4-7 pm for the Happy hour specials."

I've been several times and have always been pleased with the simple but flavorful dishes. The menu has mostly standard fare with an Italian/Mediterranean focus, but everything is expertly done in big portions with the freshest-tasting of ingredients.

Of course, the slick Four Seasons service is in evidence and the place manages that careful balance of feeling refined yet casual."

Easy to make reservations on Open Table, and when I called to update the reservations to a later time they were super polite and accommodating - especially considering the reservation was for a group of 8 (which wound up actually being 7).\n\nFirst, the food - that's what you really go for, right?  The menu looks great; unfortunately, some of the dishes don't deliver.  Although I did like my salad first-course, others in the group weren't so lucky.  One person's scallops were over-cooked and rubbery, and the caprese salad was so salty it couldn't be eaten.  More mixed reviews on the main dishes.  The short-ribs were a hit and people liked the oxtail ravioli, but the skin on my sea bass was soggy instead of a nice, crunchy texture, and someone had undercooked chicken that had to be sent back.\n\nThe worst part of the evening?  The service.  Our waiter came by twice in roughly an hour - first to give us menus, then to take our orders.  Even though it took about 90 minutes to get our dinners, he never came back to ask if we wanted more drinks, say it's coming, etc.  And there were only 4 other parties in the restaurant!  When we finally complained to the manager, there was no apology - simply a head nod.  Truly disappointing.  The apology only came awkwardly during the THIRD conversation with the manager, after the raw chicken had to be sent back.  Then came the after dinner chocolates - they brought 6. For a group of 7. This was possibly the worst service I've ever experienced.  It's a real negative mark on the Four Season's luxury brand.  \n\nBecause I like to leave things on a positive note, the drinks were great, as was the bread basket."

The turkey was moist, mashed potatoes and stuffing great, 3 kinds of pie for dessert, and a quiet, less crowded atmosphere.  Considering everyone working at Verandah was working on Thanksgiving, they were exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  I don't know why we didn't just plan to go here for our Thanksgiving dinner in the first place, but it worked out nonetheless.\n\nWe went back for breakfast the next morning and were happy with the food, atmosphere, and service then too.\n\nOur experience with Verandah was definitely a 5 star experience."

The Mac and cheese was good and big enough to share between two small children. The hot dog plate came with two mini hot dogs. The passion iced tea is so refreshing and it came with unlimited refills! The beet salad was surprisingly very filling. Our server Jose was simply amazing! He made our dining experience very comfortable. He knew to bring the kids out their food quick. We look forward to dining here again."

The place is so lovely, quiet and relaxing it's almost like not being in Vegas at all (which sometimes is a good thing.)\n\nWe opted to have champagne with our tea (why stop drinking now?) and chose the Organic Assam tea which was amazing! Also amazing are the scones, with and without currants. Super light and delicious. The sandwiches (there are four) are all good, but only the smoked turkey stood out to me. We were sadly underwhelmed by the desserts. I think the mango tart was the best of the bunch.\n\nService is fabulous - unobtrusive while still being attentive."

We sat inside, but from the looks of it, sitting outside would still be a nice environment for a meeting. All around, it's a nice spot to enjoy good food, good service and hopefully nice weather.\n\nThe service was excellent and the wait staff was very aware of our needs - we were spoiled! The soup of the day was mushroom when we went and it was excellent - everyone at our table had a cup. Portions for the lunch menu were manageable, too, not overwhelming. \n\nLocated in the Four Seasons at the south end of The Strip, Veranda's staff meets the standards that I would expect at a location like this. They went above and beyond and that was just for lunch. I would love to enjoy an evening meal here."

We didn't realize the entire area was brunch, we stuck to the corner and were already full and overwhelmed with options, we got a second plate. Then realized there was an omelette station, dessert station, fruit, breads, etc. Our server was very nice and we got refills on orange juice, which was by the way the best and most fresh orange juice I've ever had. So much class and so much food, I would definitely recommend this place!"

We had breakfast there during our ray at the Four Seasons with the breakfast package. Normally we avoid buffets but this was outstanding. High points were the fresh doughnuts, breakfast flatbread, quiche, sweet roll, and my favorite, the bread pudding. They also let us order eggs benedict fresh from the kitchen. I recommend this highly for brunch."

Crispy Basket of Hazelnut, White Chocolate, Espresso Gelato, Orange Flavored Cotton Candy\nDouble Espresso and Ice\n\nVisited just weeks ago for brunch as a guest of the Four Seasons there was little doubt that a return to Veranda was in order, and when the recently renovated restaurant decided to open its doors at 50% off to any diner making a December reservation on Black Friday the deal proved too hard to resist - the discount proving most fortuitous in the setting of a restaurant that has the gall to charge $14 for two tiny eggplant rolls and $12 for double espresso of less-than-ideal Lavazza served alongside, not over, ice as if defying one to make a mess in trying to do it themself.\n\nAcknowledging the fact that the first experience at Veranda was coordinated by PR with superlative service from start to finish, suffice it to say that a second meal booked under the name of two friends offered less impressive timing and having ordered substantially with requests for items to be sent out in a rather specific manner the start of the meal was almost inexplicably rushed - the delicious and soft focaccia hitting the table before menus were even opened and both fourteen dollar meatballs and the aforementioned eggplant arriving before a few small bites of brilliantly balanced salad were fully consumed.\n\nTreated next to a pizza that featured a surprisingly buttery crust with little char and rather flavorless tomatoes that thankfully received an upgrade from thickly applied Mozzarella and light accents of basil it would not be long before an onslaught of primi arrived and with the four-top table as well as meager sharing plates obviously overburdened despite our server personally suggesting he would \"space out the pastas\" two of the dishes were immediately sent back to the kitchen - Chef Minichiello obviously taking the gesture seriously by not only coming out to personally apologize, but also individually plating each subsequent course in tasting-menu fashion.\n\nSpeaking specifically to the quality of the noodles, aside from the signature \"jar\" with pasta that logically becomes a bit soft due to the cooking technique, it can only be said that most of Minichiello's housemade creations are served with textbook consistency and with the two meaty courses more 'up front' with the flavors of slow-cooked proteins allowed to shine the flavors of the Pasta Cotta Nel Vaso and Tagliolini were far more restrained, the first melding shellfish and herbs with light cream while the later was an aromatic masterpiece, the saffron and sea beans each offering their unmistakable flavors in balance to sweet, snappy prawns.\n\nPairing a half-chicken cooked Cacciatora-style, with far better results than that at Giada according to my two friends, to two sides that were simple yet impeccably prepared to maximize the flavor of every ingredient it was at this point that each in our party noted that we were becoming quite full and yet with a half-off dessert menu featuring no less than seven items I'd have liked to try it was with some restraint that only three were ordered - the doughnuts a but underwhelming when compared to the buttery seasonal Crostada, but neither even in the same ballpark as the 'signature' in terms of taste or presentation, the cotton-candy topped pedestal featuring soft lady fingers and mascarpone soaked in Amaretto with boozy blueberries and three balls of ice cream making for one heck of a 'sundae.'\n\nTipping on the pre-discount total to the tune of just over $200 for the table it must be said that considering the cost of the meal Veranda presented one of the best dining values on the Strip in this particular circumstance, but taking into account the service gaffs and truly laughable coffee upcharge the question becomes whether yet another visit could be justified at double the price - something I cannot say I'm certain about at this point."

They have redecorated the restaurant in what might be described as Contemporary Pacific Rim for Italian fare. Ambiance aside, it was the dinners that fell hopelessly into the category of grossly over priced for very unimpressive cuisine. One member of our party had to send his inedible pasta dish back, not once, but twice. The fact that his dinner was later comped did not alter the on going dining disruption for our entire party. Other guests found their dinners ranged from grossly lacking to ordinary. A Filet steak that was ordered Medium was served Rare. A side order of spinach was 1/2 cup of tasteless lukewarm greens. The Cotton Candy creation that was to be shared was laughable and correctly described by another reviewer."

What the yelp reviews hadn't made clear (at least among the ones I read) was that the brunch buffet they do is only on weekends.  It says it on Verandah's website; I'm just an idiot.  And I'd been looking forward to a fancy tasty buffet, so other Yelpers, be forewarned!  \n\nSo instead we had lunch.  I had the nicoise salad, and my husband had the ABC pizza.  Both were pretty incredible, but I think I mourned not having the brunch option the whole meal.  \n\nI have to return.\n\nBesides being a really beautiful, chill environment, just venturing into the Four Seasons was an experience in and of itself.  We'd never stopped by before, and it was such a breath of fresh air (literally!) to enter a hotel on LV Blvd that was non-smoking, beautiful without being Vegas-gaudy, and allowed pets.  We had a blast watching people taking their dogs out and parading them through the lobby while we waited for our friends.\n\nEverything about Verandah and the Four Seasons feels so un-Vegas...and that's part of why it's fantastic."

Fair enough.\n\nI especially like having lunch here. I try to get in one lunch per visit, just for this reason alone: ice tea ice cubes. Yes, just like Bonjour Cafe does with their ice coffee w/coffee ice cubes (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bonjour-french-pastry-gardena), this Four Seasons doesn't dilute their ice tea with regular ol' water ice cubes. Bah. That's for amateurs. Here, they bring you a glass filled with ice tea cubes and then pour in the hot ice tea, so you get full concentration and no dilution of a caffeine buzz.\n\nTheir soups, salads and sandwiches are always nice. And if it's a nice day out, you can eat al fresco. \n\nApparently, them changing out by white napkin for a black one because I was wearing black slacks was a big deal, because DK asked what the heck they were doing. I thought it was pretty common, but I guess not. Or maybe I've just been frequenting restaurants where they care about you not walking out looking like a doofus with white lint all over your white pants.\n\nThis is the only Four Seasons I know of that has the ice tea cubes. So don't blame me if you go to another Four Seasons asking for this and they look at you all crazy-like."

            "review": "Located in the 4 Seasons Hotel, this is my favorite place to escape the loudness of Vegas, re-energize and most obviously, eat some delicious brunch. Verandah's menu allows one to either order a particular item for brunch or one can do the all you can eat brunch buffet. Although a bit pricey (I think it is around $50 with a mimosa), you definately get what you pay for with the buffet.\n\nI have been coming here for years and have always had great service, my water, coffee and juice always refilled and my check handed to me at an appropriate time. I highly recommend the guava juice if they have it that day.\n\nSome highlights of the buffet include: 1) omelette station that doesn't consist of a family of 5 pushing you out of the way and a really depressed omelette chef who burns your omellete; 2) delicious pastries including mini chocolate croissants; 3) flavorful apple sausage; 4) cheeses and charcutterie items; 5) fresh fruit galore; 6) and FRESHLY MADE MINI DONUTS :)\n\nI highly recommend this place for brunch if you want a peaceful, quality brunch in a restaurant setting, and to avoid the crazy crowds at some of the Strip's more popular buffets."

I love the loveseat tables out by the pool, so comfy!  The iced tea is so good - passionfruit? with tea ice cubes and liquid sugar - why doesn't every restaurant prepare it this way?  I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.  I love this little oasis on the Strip!"

Sat for about 2 minutes before the SA came over to get drinks, She promptly delivered our juice, coffee and tea. We waited to order breakfast... and waited.... and waited.... and waited some more. There were three tables in the restaurant other than ours. The servers had plenty of time to stand around chatting but apparently not enough time to take our breakfast order. We notified the management were were apologetic, which we appreciated. The server then came over and said \"Can I take your order?\" Seriously? No hello, how are you, good morning? Gee, thanks a lot. As a service industry professional, it really grinds my gears to see people who have great jobs at a semi fine-dining restaurant waste my time because they're lazy. I'm never coming back here. I will say that the hostesses and our beverage server were nice as well as the management so this is just a reflection on the wait staff. You are lucky to have a cushy gig. get it together!!!!"

We had great appetizers and then our entrees came out. My friend ordered the filet steak and it came out a little too well done- although the flavor was delicious. We told them and they cleared it immediately. While they were redoing the dish -the server, manager, and head chef! came out to apologize and sent out two amazing courses in the mean time! (So over and beyond) -gourmet courses that were delectable- in addition to apology on apology (all over a steak taking an extra 10 minutes which was no big deal to begin with). Dinner was cleared and they continued to send out limoncello after dinner cocktails. We had dessert and too top it all off Kevin sent out a plate with a personalized message written in chocolate! Needless to say -excellent excellent service. Delicious food. Cheers to Kevin and to Verandah for a wonderful and memorable evening."

            "review": "There aren't a lot of dining options at Four Season LV but at least what they do have tastes good! We tried out Veranda for both the breakfast buffet and the regular dinner and we were pretty happy both times. \n\nDinner: The service was top notch and in particular, our server (I forgot his name but he was a blondish man in maybe his 40s) couldn't be nicer and more accommodating. The portions were larger than I expected. We split a Caesar salad and it was a generous portion. My husband had the shrimp pasta and he said it was one of the best pasta dishes he's ever had (and he's a pasta fanatic). I had the braised short ribs and every bite was super tender and melted in my mouth. We also tried the dessert that included four ice cream bars (made in house - caramel ice cream coated with chocolate and nuts) and they were delicious and just perfect for sharing. My toddler's pasta with red sauce was a very generous portion and he enjoyed his scoop of gelato as well. The setting is \"fancy\" but they were great with our toddler and had a coloring book with crayons available. \n\nBreakfast: You can either order off the menu or do the buffet and we opted to do the buffet, which is priced about the same as other more high-end resort buffets. What I liked about this is that the food was pre-portioned into single servings so things like bread pudding didn't look all gross after a few people have dug into it. The options include: corned beef hash (with shoestring potatoes), peach pancakes, egg florentine, hash browns (actually, this was a bit salty), bread pudding, scones, house smoked salmon, bacon, sausages, lots of pastries, some kind of quinoa chia pudding, oatmeal, yogurt and granola parfait, omelet station, melon slices, mixed berries, and even more things that I can't remember. There was also a kids station (kids height) with breakfast sandwiches, fruit kabobs, vegetable sticks (with dip), and jam sandwiches. \n\nThe coconut mango Greek yogurt flan was AMAZING. (I need the recipe!) I don't like yogurt but this was not tart or yogurt-y. The mini donuts, which is what everyone talks about, are delicious and made fresh. I recommend the cinnamon sugar one which tastes like a churro."

I had the Cloud of Gnocci for dinner which, as the name indicates, was light and very tasty. I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a heavy big dish, but I loved it. Had the apple tart for dessert, which is beautiful and tasty. Didn't love the goat cheese crumble on it, but they didn't overwhelm the tart. It didn't actually have any pie crust, which I missed.

I've been to London & love their Afternoon Tea, and wanted to do something similar with my friends. From the reviews, I thought Verandah would be a perfect fit. We arrived early & were told we had to wait until 3pm. Waiting 15 mins was fine. We were taken to our table shortly after 3pm, and served water. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. It was 20 mins before anyone took our tea order.\n\nNow...the place was NOT busy. Our table of four was the biggest table they had in the room we were in, and the front room had maybe three tables. What really bothered us was the table of two that came in several minutes after us for their tea, that was served before us. Um...not cool. My friend's water glass was empty several minutes & several waiters rushed past us so fast we couldn't flag them down to ask for more. I contemplated getting up to serve her water myself, but finally a slower moving waitress walked past & I was able to ask for water.\n\nI realize the experience is supposed to be a relaxing one, but when you can't keep water glasses full & you're serving tea and food to people who arrive later than your other customers, that's just not the service I would expect from the Four Seasons. \n\nThe food was pretty good, though. Which is a pity because we won't be going back."

The Mozzarella Carrozza was delicious and I would have gladly ordered a second plate had I been pleased with the service (almost being impaled with silverware when the server *threw* them down on the table in front of us was a big miss).    \n\nThe drinks were quite good as well. I enjoyed the Mai Thai, although it seems the bartender overfilled the drink; the glass was sticky. I'd expect that at a dive-bar, but not from The Four Seasons. \n\nOverall, I was sorely disappointed with my visit to Veranda.

Would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a quiet elegant or even romantic breakfast away from the bustle of the Strip !"

I would prefer the breast meat to avoid the at smell of the dark meat (thigh meats tend to have a smell). Breakfast buffet was fresh and delicious. We stayed at the Mandalay Bay hotel but came here often to dine. The Four Seasons hotel is really nice and quiet. If you want to go to Vegas but not have the hustle and bustle of Sin City, this is your hotel. We might stay here next time."

The setting isn't very formal and there's an outdoor seating area with ceiling fans and shade for those that want to hang outside. \n\nWe changed things up by ordering the calamari (fritto misto). A good choice as there was shrimp/calamari and green peppers which brought it some heat. I looked back at my previous review and my significant other ordered the same thing as he did last year. The Brasato Barolo (short ribs) which is a definitely a MUST try... very flavorful, melts in your mouth deliciousness. I decided to get the rack of lamb which was good, nothing extraordinary....a lil bit over done for the \"medium\" that it was supposed to be but I think I could pass it up next time. The best dish of the night was Antonio's Pasta. It was cooked in the glass jar shown in pictures with scallops, shrimp and the best fresh pasta ever! The flavors were just wonderful and I could have just had that for dinner and been content. We ended it with a wonderful chocolate souffle that wasn't overly sweet and paired well with the dolce latte flavored gelato. They also surprised us with a plate of truffles and a Happy Anniversary written on it....sweet touch to a great night.\n\nVerandah's service has always been and still is attentive. Delicious food paired with great service makes it for a great night. They also know how to make a lemon drop martini like how this gal likes it....bonus points there since I've been highly dissatisfied with a lot of lemon drop martinis at other venues. I definitely will be back for more short ribs, etc."

We were comfortably sat at a round table that fit our group of 6 perfectly. Close enough to the pool but far enough away that you're not getting splashed. So what makes the Verandah Sunday brunch amazing, everything is miniature. \n\nWhat do I mean by miniature. Well, first off - don't even bother getting the a la carte menu. I'm sure its good, but you want the buffet. Trust me. But you never eat enough to pay for how much a buffet costs? I know, that's me too. This one is worth it.\n\nEvery lil food option is shrunk down so that you can try EVERYTHING and not be full. All of the meats, breads, fruits, yogurt, everything is in these little tasters so that you really can have everything. The in house homemade peanut butter is to die for as is the donuts being rolled right in front of you. \n\nOur waitress was wonderful. We didn't even want any champagne after the weekend we'd had and she was so on the ball with coffee and tea refills. Wonderful!

There's a great selection of tea- I had the mountain berry, which is like a hibiscus (so slightly tart and sour) and packed with vitamin C. \n\nThe food was also fantastic. The scones are the best ones I've had-- super light and fluffy. They make one plain and one with currants, and is accompanied with THE best cream. I surprisingly liked all the sandwiches, and I think the biggest difference was the quality of the bread and the fact that the sandwiches were not dry. Desserts were a nice mix and not overly sweet.\n\nThe best tea for me in Vegas would be the food here with Mandarin Oriental's view!"

One day the buffet was set up, and it looked like it was very nice and had a lot of unusual items, but we don't eat enough any more to justify the \"investment\".  I had the corned beef & pastrami hash browns, which was very good and a bit unusual in that the hash was more like very tiny french fries.  It was much better than Carnegie Deli's (in LV or NYC), and reminded me more of how good the pastrami hash at Stage Deli used to be, although it's not the same, of course.  My wife had the tiramisu croissant, which was very good but is more like a dessert than breakfast.  We ate inside that morning, and the service was very good.\n\nA couple of days later, we had breakfast outside, and it seems to take a while to get the waiter's attention and he was nowhere to be found a couple of times when we had a request.  My wife had the quinoa and muesle (or similar), and didn't expect the quinoa to be cold.  That was a bit unusual.  I had the eggs Benedict, which was quite good, but didn't come with toast or any other sides, which seems unusual as well.\n\nMy wife had coffee both days, and didn't remark one way or the other upon it.  I had herbal tea, as my metabolism can't tolerate caffeine, and for both of us there were pots placed on the table for us to refill from.\n\nWe didn't have the opportunity to try any other meals here, but we will if we stay at the Four Seasons again."

I feel like a little kid getting all excited and am disappointed every time I dine at a FS restaurant. I decided never come back to Veranda, but why?\n\n1) The service was not on par with that of other FS restaurants - While the food at Allium and Blue Bar are mediocre, the waiters are friendly and helpful. On the other hand, the waiter at Veranda confused the orders of my friend and mine. She also forgot our requests for water. \n2) The food was mediocre - Although I appreciated the parfait being less sweet, I was not happy that the ratio of the non-fat Greek yogurt and the granola was one to four. I ended up eating dry nuts most of the time. The orange juice that both of us had was not fresh and was slightly bitter. The juice was definitely two levels below that in MOzen at Mandarin Oriental. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the view of the pool and the palm trees, I was disappointed by the overpriced mediocre food of Verandah.

Maybe it was how the Four Seasons screwed up my reservation and made us scramble to find a room the day BEFORE we were suppose to come (a story for another time) that tainted our breakfast. I don't know. The huevos rancheros were good, not great. The coffee was good, not great. It was just off. And to make matters worse, they took off the menu one of the best breakfast items on the strip, the corned beef and pastrami hash. No longer and I was so in the mood for it! Sigh. The track record speaks for itself so I will undoubtedly return again.

Needless to say, I was flippin starving, and when I'm that hungry, I never know what I want because nothing sounds good enough. So I decided that after my spa treatment, to treat myself further by visiting the very near and very posh Four Seasons Hotel. I stopped by the concierge desk at the Mandalay Bay (where I was staying) and asked if there was anything she could recommend me at the Four Seasons and she directed me to Verandah.\n\nLet me just say, that this was the best solitary lunch I've ever had. It was a beautiful, crisp, January afternoon and I chose to sit outside and have lunch with my Cavalli sunglasses on. Having no reservations, I requested a table for 1, but before I was even taken to my table, I was offered a newspaper for reading. I opted for my British Elle magazine instead.\n\nI ordered a sparkling water with lime, and it came out with a varietal bread basket along with some pure olive oil the waiter walks around with in a fancy little pourer. Personally, I think the bread basket is an indicator of how nice a restaurant is, and this was no exception. Wanting to present myself as a posh customer, I forwent most of it, and proceeded to order the Italian Wedge Salad. I love wedge salads, it sets the scene for a high-end power lunch. For my main lunch course, I went with one of the restaurant's signature dish, the \"Christina\" Panini that had pesto chicken, onion jam, basil mayo, tomatoes, and provolone, with a small side broccoli salad. Service was expectedly impeccable, because they brought out the check almost immediately after I mentioned I had an appointment in half an hour (an appointment with the Lion King matinee showing!).\n\nI sat there for an hour reading my magazine, enjoying the sun and solitude, noshing on $30 worth of wedge salad and chicken panini and it was fabulous. Definitely keeping this place my own secret Vegas hiding place, and coming back for their afternoon tea which you have to reserve a day in advance and is only available on the weekdays.\n\nAfter a long night of drinking and gambling, an early spa treatment is in order, and after, a quiet lunch at the Verandah followed by an early matinee show of the Lion King really puts you back in the mood to hit the town again!"
