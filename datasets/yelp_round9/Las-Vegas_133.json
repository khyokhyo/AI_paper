Yellowtail, tuna, garlic tuna, salmon, eel, shrimp, white tuna and twister scallop. \n\nAYCE includes hot and cold appetizers, full or half rolls (you choose) and dessert. Make sure to get a stamp card! \n\nMust tries: Screaming Orgasm, Japanese lasagna, kill samurai.\n\nMy wife usually does the chicken dinner. It's a great a great value for the size. Comes with veggie and shrimp tempura, salad, rice, miso, California roll (you can upgrade to any other roll), miso, and of course Teri chicken."

Great timing. No wait. Seated right away. \n- Sit at bar for faster sushi service. \n- For appetizers, order from waitress. \n- Friendly waitress. She actually told us she doesn't mind if you don't eat all your rice. Just try your best. haha! \n- Amazing sushi chef! We had the legit old Japanese guy. \n- My method of attack:\n1. Get all the items with a happy face on it. That means that they are expensive and limit one per person.\n2. Get the items with the moon icon for dinner only. \n3. Look for the most expensive rolls. \n4. Save room for the mochi. \n- My recommendations unique to Twister \n1. Island tuna poki: good side with sushi\n2. Screaming orgasm: great appetizer\n3. Salmon loves lemon: for salmon sashimi lovers\n4. Spider-Man: for soft shell crab lovers\n5. Rum jungle: Great japanese salsa taste\n- Only AYCE that I've been to where you can get 1/2 a roll! Great for selection. \n- Compared to Goyemon, you can't get grilled fishes here. \n- Come for the unique sushi selection."

After reading reviews we thought this place would be a lot better quality than what we received. Granted everyone raves about their fresh fish that wasn't the case for us. \n\nWe weren't extremely hungry to do AYCE so we opted for a combo plate which had a lot of food on it. Large portion of Teri chicken, veggie tempura, salad and a California roll. For $9 this was a good deal for all the food we recieved. I ordered a San Francisco fire roll but asked for it to be tempura fries with eel sauce. My guy also ordered an order of smelt egg nigiri and I ordered an order of Garlic tuna nigiri. Both of which were not fresh. We alps recieved a salmon loves lemon roll which we did not order but we ate anyway and that was also pretty good. \n\nService was alright and the nigiri should have been fresh,but I would drive elsewhere for sushi even though it's convienently located close to my home. \n\nDon't forget that yelp hours are not correct. They close at 10 not 11!"

            "review": "One of the top sushi places in town. I mostly like to eat their salmon and seared tuna nigiri. Love their red bean ice cream, too.\n\nFor big parties (since everytime I'm here, it's with a big party of 6+), they will do split checks. Ask for the stamp card so that you get a stamp for each person and get the 10th ayce free.\n\nUnlike some places, they will do half rolls, but not on everything. They only have two types of mochi ice cream (and it's one per person) of mango and strawberry. For their unlimited ice cream, they only have green tea and red bean. I wish they had chocolate of either :(.\n\nEach time, I'm pretty happy with their service so that's a plus. Pretty consistent, too. The only reason why I wouldn't come here as often would be because of its location. So far away from me :(. If you're in the area, DROP BY FOR SOME SUSHI!"

            "review": "I can only comment on their takeout lunch specials.  I usually get the seafood poki bowl.  It is an assorted dish of fish such as salmon and tuna on a bed of rice and seaweed.  The types of fish they put in your bowl may vary, but I've always noticed salmon was always in my order.  \nThe portion is quite generous. Not bad for $8.38! I like the container it comes in. The presentation is pretty nice.\n\nThe beef lunch special is not bad either. It says on the menu it's a Kobe style filet mignon chip beef.  For $8.50 you can't go wrong.  \n\nService is great.  The waitresses always let you check your food before they bag it up.\n\nI have yet to try their AYCE!"

We called ahead and ordered a tray of sushi.  When we arrived, the hostess notified the guys that we were there for the pick up and it took about ten minutes to complete.  \n\nOnce home, we looked it over and found they provided three big wallops of wasabi and pickled ginger.  And we loved the spicy tuna, the caterpillar roil and the dragon.  It was a great mix, the ahi was pink and fresh.  Definitely a good choice."

And every time I dine here it is fresh.  I almost always order all you can eat.  \n\nBut if I don't  then I'll order one of their lunch/dinner teriyaki plates (chicken, beef, salmon, etc.)  I like ordering the dish with the teriyaki on the side and adding it to my protein in the amount I want.  The staff has expanded since this place has become really popular.  They are all nice and friendly.  The bar and tables are always clean and the sushi masstttaasss behind the counter always bid you farewell.  If they're not busy making bomb diggity bomb sushi!\n\nI love any type of nigiri, they do have special sushi rolls too.  Crunchy Roll is one of my fav but I really love me a lot of nigiri.  They have specials too, just look up on a wooden board on the wall.  They have a projection screen, a wide screen but not necessary.  \n\nI wish this place had not gotten popular so I can keep it to myself!"

We had the AYCE and it worked out great because most of the rolls can be ordered as a \"half\" roll and it allows you to try more different orders. We did notice that each item had its own taste. Sometimes when eating sushi, everything ends up tasting the same. Chefs were great but had to remind the waitresses several times about things ordered thru them (. Eg: soup, salad, drinks) not a big issue!  It reminds me of the small eateries that you would find outside of the city. Like those small family places that you find In the country or provinces. Like Arnold said, I'LL BE BACK!"

            "review": "I have been coming to this place for over 6 years now and it used to be one of my top 3 favorite AYCE in town. A lot of them have lower quality fish but not twister, that combined with the fact that the sushi chefs are friendly and generous and their 13 meals and get one free promotion, they had me sold. I've eaten here for free many, many, times. Recently though, even I have to admit their standards are falling. Now they have added new items to the menu, superwhite comes to mind, (it was good) and the ninja and angry ninja are still superb, but we ordered the spiderman, and it was not right. Came out as a completely different roll than ever before.. weird, pretty good, but still weird. So we ordered another one to see if maybe they changed the recipe, this one was different than any roll we'd ever had before.. still pretty good but what the hell were they serving us. Not being nit-picky but its pretty bad if the customers know the rolls better than the staff.. One of my favorite things to eat there is the monkey ball, I usually order 3 or 4 to myself but the sauce on these tasted so burnt and not sweet at all that it made them horrible, we barely finished one between us. The service wasn't great this time either as there were more staff in the restaurant than customers and we still couldn't get served/our order taken in a timely fashion. This coupled with the fact that when the guy combined my stamps from different cards he took all 8 off of cards with very long expirations and put them all on a card that had one stamp with a very close expiration. When I returned a week and a half later to claim it they told me I was a week late and most of the cards that I had their expiration was over 6 months away. Looks like they are trying to cut some corners and save some money but I think all that it is doing is driving long term customers away. I mean their fryer wasn't even to temp and all the fried things took forever and came out almost white instead of Golden Brown like they should be. For many years I would have given this place a 5 stars rating but no longer unless they clean up their act they may be another Vegas sushi casualty, especially when there are many better places now that are closer than the 45 mins it takes to drive to twister. It breaks my heart to write this review but maybe it will inspire them to go back to the place they used to be, or head someone away from a bad experience and into a good one. I can hope at least.."

(we live on the east side, near the AFB) \n\nWe love this place. Sometimes it will be pretty busy, but it's worth the wait. A few of the wait staff recognize us since we would come here almost every Friday. They have a good variety of rolls and it tastes good so I think it's fantastic. :) \n\nA big bonus to this restaurant is that you can order half rolls! I love LOVE that because sometimes I could eat more, but might not be able to finish a full roll. It also gives me a chance to try a new roll if I'm on the fence about it. \n\nI'm not familiar with the All You Can Eat. It'd be a waste of our money because we get full after one or two rolls. \n\nWe love this place and are glad that we found a good place not too far from our apt."

            "review": "I came here last night for the first time and had all-you-can-eat.  First, it was pretty packed -- the wait was about 20-30 minutes around 9:00 PM for a group of 6 -- but the wait was worth it.\n\nI ordered the rainbow, volcano, and salmon loves lemon rolls and the screaming orgasm appetizer.  The screaming orgasm came out first, it was presented differently than I've seen at most sushi bars, but the \"ecstasy\" sauce was the best part of it.  There is a one-order limit on these, so I'd suggest if you're going with a big group and you want more than one to have everyone in the group order one, whether they want it or not to get the most out of it. \n\nThe rainbow and salmon loves lemon rolls came out together.  No complaints there.  The rainbow is a pretty generic roll, so it's hard to mess up, but the fish all tasted great and fresh.  The salmon loves lemon roll reminds me of a roll at Sushi Factory East (can't remember what it's called, maybe the LA Boxing roll?).  Anyway, I liked the thin slice of lemon on top, it added an interesting flavor to the salmon and california roll underneath. \n\nThe volcano roll came out last and it was pretty much perfect -- not too much yum yum sauce, but enough to get the flavor.  I also love the baked scallops on top.\n\nI also tried pieces of the Mexican and Rum Jungle rolls.  The Mexican roll was tasty and just the right amount of spicy; the Rum Jungle roll, on the other hand, was good, except for the Japanese \"salsa\" on top.  I'd probably get it without the salsa next time. \n\nFor dessert, I had the mango mochi, which was nothing special, but good.  There is a one-order limit on the mochi and only two flavors (mango and strawberry), but the green tea and red bean ice cream is unlimited.\n\nThe AYCE dinner was $26.95 and there was an automatic gratuity of 18% for our group of 6.  They also have a punch card, where if you eat there 10 times you get 1 free. \n\nThe service was better than most sushi places I've been to, so that was a plus.  They were pretty attentive and usually came by pretty frequently so that we could order more rolls on a steady basis.  Overall, I liked this place, but I most likely will not return unless I'm in the area."

And they have a sushi bar at the front of the restaurant which is great the reason why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the seating is so close to each other you are pretty much part of another without realizing it. This should buy at the Starbucks or the smoke shop next door and expand their restaurant just my personal opinion"

Our party of 5 got the \"big\" table and it seemed it was an inconvenience to them because many people were waiting for that. Our wait between orders was long. Everything was a long wait even for a refill, a napkin or a glass of water. The our server even had the nerve to ask if we were actually gonna finish everything and didn't even wait for us to even finish ordering... she just left! I guess I understand that they were extremely busy but they shouldn't have made that our fault. We didn't ask for that table or to have our food take long to be served. I guess what matters is that the food was pretty good. I still prefer Yama for food and service!"

I never feel like I get my money worth when doing AYCE because I try not to over-eat, so I am limited in the variety I get to choose. \n\nWe ordered off the AYVE menu and it was well worth it. With the half orders available, we were able to try 9 different styles and appetizers. It was the perfect amount of food between the 2 of us. We didn't feel like we needed to overeat to get to try more variety and we left feeling well fed but not overstuffed. \n\nThe service was amazing the whole time, with the owner(?) personally waiting on us and checking in on our experience. We had a great time and were not rushed to get back to the office. We had plenty of time to drive there, eat without rushing and drive back with a couple minutes to spare. \n\nThe prices are decent, though it's still a bit much for lunch. I can't complain as we still enjoyed AYCE with no issues. \n\nI will definitely be back, and hopefully we'll have the same experience."

            "review": "A few months ago, a friend who loves sushi had told me about this place. I believe the first time i tried this was around May 2010. Located on the east side of town at the intersection of Tropicana and Boulder Highway, it was clearly on the opposite side of town where i lived. Prices were average at $26.95/person for dinner, and $21.95/person for lunch. \n\nFirst impression? Upon entry, widely greeted by all the staff in japanese and was quickly shown to our table. According to my friend, the owner is one that stands closest to the entrance to the restaurant at the corner of the sushi bar. He used to be a chef at another restaurant, but later left and opened this place. This is when I first started to rate places i go to, so i didnt have a variety of tests to check the place out, but as of recently i had checked, they passed it all. Fish not presliced and covered with serand wrap in the refrigeration cabinet at the sushi bar. One thing people order initially is the tamago nigiri. It is to test the skill of the sushi chef as well as an initial test for the rice. Both very good. Egg was sweet and cut thick. Rice was a small amount and had a particular nice taste that complimented well. (pride of the sushi chef). \n\nWe had orders the 3 primary fish (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) for nigiri, enough to taste/see the quality before we order more. Small amount of rice, nice good size slice of fish. Rice flavor complimented the freshness and sweetness of each fish very nicely. And then, it was game over. 30+ orders of each salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. Best quality fish ever have tasted at a all-you-can-eat restaurant in las vegas. \n\nOn the side note, you are able to ask the chef what is the freshest fish they have that day is, and try that. Usually pretty good as well even if its not salmon, tuna, or yellowtail.\n\nThe waitresses and chefs are very open to custom orders of any kind (i mean almost any kind... oh man, my friend made a weird one - natto and squid topped with yum yum sauce... i shiver at the idea of natto... *shivers*) \n\nAnother note, try to remember to look at the special on the wall opposite of the sushi bar. Sometimes they have pretty good specials that you can order, that is included in the all-you-can-eat plan. Sometimes they have blue fin tuna or fatty tuna ! O_O YUMMY !\n\nHave tried a few of the rolls and they are pretty good too. None with sauces too overpowering but enough to produce a flavor from the sauce without covering the flavor of the ingredients\n\nAlso... desserts... all-you-can-eat ice cream and mochi... a plus for a lot of people =P esp since i love green tea ice cream =] \n \nQuality of this place is really good, though its far for some people, but in my opinion, definately worth it. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nMy friends and I rate this place a 9.5 out of 10 with a minimum score of at least 7 from the several times we have ate at this restaurant."

First was Nigiri Sushi of yellowtail, albacore, and eel.  My first roll the matsuri,is a shrimp tempura cucumber wrapped in spicy tuna and light tuna with very little sauce. The second order was of the signature Sushi twister which is shrimp tempura cucumber wrapped in tuna. The third was a rum jungle which is deep fried soft-shell crab crab meat and cucumber wrap with spicy tuna and Albacore. I made a point to order all the rolls with no sauce.  My second order of the hot chicken karage, I ordered with  sriracha sauce.  Almost forgot to order the much reviewed about salmon loves lemon roll, which is fresh salmon with lemon in a California roll.  As my stomach is filling up I just asked for a bit of a taste and that's when i ordered (see picture) of the salmon with a bit of avocado on top and lemon. That should have been my dessert. Creamy. Finished dinner with the green tea ice cream."

In fact, my normal means of choice is lackluster at Sushi Twister. They offer many of the quintessential fishes, but nothing particularly unique.\n\nOn the other had, the rolls were not predominantly tempura shrimp based, so my two friends and I went crazy on them. The spice levels next to some rolls made for an exciting adventure, but sometimes falls short of what was promised. I did not find any of the level fives to be unbearable or even tongue tingly. Instead they had a controlled heat that went well with the other components. The Crunchy, Angry Ninja, Kill Samurai were all good. We were even surprised by how much we liked the Cowgirl. Normally we would not order a beef roll, but the meat was tender and cooked medium.\n\nThe appetizers comprised of many standard options and a few specials. The oysters are a must get if they are offered. One order per person is the limit, but the two large bivalves should not be passed up. The Monkey Ball is also becoming more common. The spicy tuna stuffed mushroom comes as a single ball, order more if there are multiple people."

The service was excellent and timely, and they were packed.\n\nOur favorite items included the albacore, garlic tuna, Kill Samurai, and Cowgirl. You can order 1/2 or full orders, which we loved.

A few times my friends brought me to Sushi Factory East (which is now closed, perfect timing since I just got a full stamp card...) a few times. One day I wanted sushi of my own for lunch and Twister was right down the road. I went in, ordered a Japanese Lasagna to go, and walked home.\n\nI have NEVER been blown away by food like this. The roll was simply the most delicious thing I have ever consumed and is now my usual favorite here. (I always get at LEAST half of a roll!)\n\nThe quality here is unparalleled. The service is quick and amazing. The ONLY thing I don't like about this place is how everyone there hawks you down when someone at your table doesn't have AYCE. Not everyone is a thief, and looking at customers constantly so they don't share is completely unnecessary. Have some faith in people. Especially people who are in there bi-weekly spending $40 on sushi.\n\nIf you have a group of 6+ you might have to wait since the establishment is quite small inside and they don't do reservations. Keep that in mind!\n\nFree Wi-Fi if you connect to \"attwifi\" from Starbucks next door during business hours!"

Sushi Twister, though is fairly authentic and now tops my list of \"reasonable\" sushi restaurants in Vegas.\n\nI went there for lunch April 2009 and had the Sushi lunch special for $8.50. This consisted of tuna, hamachi, salmon, tuna ponzu, albacore ponzu, 8 pc calif roll. ( Or spicy tuna roll) and miso soup.\n\nThe miso soup was good, using white miso and used dashi, with tofu and wakame. The only down side was it was a little luke warm.\n\nThe sushi was very good. Fish was fresh and appropriately fatty, and cut appropriately, to the right size. The rice was properly prepared, not too mushy, not too al dente, with the vinegar seasoning. It stuck enough until you put it it\nyour mouth when it fell apart... near perect. They, unlike the many fake sushi places, do put wasabi on the rice, as it should.\n\nI also ordered the amaebi. And they took the heads and made tempura out of them.  Just like at home in Japan.\n\nThe service was average.\n\nAll in all, this place is so far tops on my list.\n\nFor me, one annoyance was the constant trans music playing."

Sushi Twister has the fastest service I have experienced at a sushi restaurant.\n\nI went here on a Saturday night with a party of three, after golfing in Tuscany.  I wasn't sure if there was going to be anything around for miles... but sure enough we came across this little sushi joint on yelp, so we decided to try it. \n\nIt's located in a pretty odd place... small building behind a 7-11 in the lot of an Albertsons... yeahhh weird. Building looked like it was cut out of a strip mall from chinatown... \n\nBut anyways, back to the story... as we were driving there I called ahead to make a reservation, the hostess had informed me that they only accept reservations after 9pm, but since I was calling ahead 10 minutes she put us down. As we got there we were seated promptly, there were a few tables still open. All of us chose all you can eat which cost $26.95 a person, same rules as anywhere else except you can only be seated for one hour for all you can eat. At first I was slightly offended by the rule, but it didn't seem like they enforced it much and the service definitely made up for it. \n\nWhat I found especially great about this place was the speed of service and sushi quality. I think we waited a total of 15 minutes from being seated to having our first roll delivered to our table. This was awesome and the rest of the rolls were no exception! Not only that but the portion sizes were great too, some rolls only had 5 pcs so if you didn't like the taste it was bearable and if you wanted me, heck that's why it's all you can eat, at least you wouldn't be stuck stuffing rolls in napkins. \n\nWhat I didn't like... the plating and atmosphere. The plating was a little disappointing in comparison to the presentation and quality of the sushi. It really bothers me when sushi restaurants use plastic or lightweight plates/bowls... it definitely had an effect on my perception of the overall experience. Also the music totally felt out of place and took away from the average sushi bar look and, it sounded like they were blasting Mix 94.1... I remember hearing a song by My Chemical Romance at one point. Not really sure how that gets you in the mood for sushi... but luckily I was in a group and able to tune it out... \n\nRecommendations:\n\nHands down the best roll for the night was the Angry Ninja, it had a bit of a kick to it but the warm crunchy goodness was delicious!\n\nThe Mango Moji had a very realistic flavor to it and tasted delicious as well!\n\n\nOverall, my expectations were definitely exceeded... I wasn't expecting to have quality sushi from a small joint behind a 7-11... I was very satisfied with the speed of service 5/5, the sushi quality was also a 4/5, however the plating and atmosphere/vibe of the place was off 3/5 for each...\n\nIf you want fast quality sushi then this place is for you!"

First time was for my birthday and this review will be for yesterday. We entered the restaurant just before a rush, so we got in right away and were seating. The Sushi chefs and waiters/waitress' were all very quick to respond to what we needed and were very friendly. \n\nRolls are very good here, though a lot of them contain fillers (Almost all had cucumber), highly recommend the Matsuri and Tiger Yamazaki rolls. I also had their Angry Ninja roll which was suppose to be one of the hottest rolls they had, sadly it wasn't hot enough for this man to burn, but hey the taste of the habanero sauce was hot, sweet, and just all around good for people who aren't more accustomed to hot foods like myself.\n\nBut for me with any Sushi place I go to, its all about the Nigiri. To me, if a place cannot do nigiri right then I don't have high hopes for anything else in the place. I had just about every type they had and all of them were very fresh, they actually season the rice unlike most places as well. \n\nWorth a drive and the price."

But, Sushi Twister is making some good sushi over on the east side of Vegas. \n\nFirst, for those living on the east side near boulder highway and Trop, and around that area, this might be your only option for AYCE sushi. And, it's not really such a bad option.\n\nAfter walking in and sitting down at the bar, I was later told by the sushi chef that  Sushi Twister is owned by the same people that own Ramen Sora in Chinatown. I was expecting a lot, and I think that they delivered nicely.\n\nOrdered too much to analyse bit by bit, but will try to give an overall impression. I thought the fish and seafood quality was good, but not great. I also thought that the rice was a tad bit on the slightly sour side. I also thought that their signature sauce that they put on many of the apps and nigiri, sort of a yuzu-type soy sauce, was too sour as well. As for the apps, I really liked the chicken karage, it was crispy, well seasoned, and cooked very nicely.\n\nSo, I like this spot, but it's a drive from me so i'll stick to my favoritos. But, for those that live in the area, this is a super solid option for those who don't wanna travel to Spring Mtn. Rd., but would still like some quality sushi."

This weekend we had a young gentleman as our server as he was on top of his game. \n\nTheir selection of nigiri is great and choices of baked and regular rolls vast.

            "review": "Before my Seattle trip, a friend and I had a sushi craving. The wonderful think about living in Las Vegas is having the option to go to AYCE (All you can eat) sushi joints. I've heard some really great things about this place from friends and neighbors. The best thing is that it's located right up the street from my house. This meal was a brainer. \n\nThis joint is located on the southwest corner of a very busy strip mall. Walking into the restaurant, you'll notice that it's cozier inside than it looks outside. The joint has a few sushi bar top seating, a couple of high top tables and a few other table seating. Staying in place for a couple of hours, I've noticed that the servers do a good job turning out the tables so there's no wait. Speaking of our servers, they were very efficient. They always came by the table to see if we were alright and if we needed anything else. For the most part, good service. \n\nFor my meal, I decided to get the All You Can Eat option for $26.95 per person. If you're going to have a few rolls, this would be the best option. Keep in mind though, this is one of  the only places I've noticed that holds everyone to the 1 hour limit. Whenever I go with the AYCE option, I tend to chow down on a lot of Nigiri sushi as it's usually a lot ala carte. On this visit, I went with the salmon, ahi and tako nigiri. The serving size was good and the fish was fresh! For other options, I went with chicken katsu, baked mussels, mochiko chicken, shrimp tempura and gyoza. All dishes were good. The katsu used white meat but had a nice crunch to it. For my gyoza, I asked for it steamed. It was flavored nicely and cooked nicely. \n\nOverall, the food is definitely worth returning to. The food came out fast, the service was nice and everything was super filling. If you're willing to eat in an hour and then leave, come down and check them out!"

My husband got an inside tip from a co-worker that knows that the owner purchases the fish the day it's flown in, so it was worth the drive to try it out. Now that we've made the trip & know that the quality of the fish they serve is top-notch, we will not hesitate to go back. Wish it was just a tad bit closer to home but that's my \"I don't want to get in my car & drive any further than I have to when it's 110 degrees\" side coming out. I will suck it up though & make the drive b/c it's that good! \n\nWe've been twice now & both times we have loved everything we've tried. I should preface this by saying that I am not a huge fan of all the \"fancy\" rolls that have become so popular over the last decade or so. I'm an old-school sushi eater, I like the simplicity of Sashimi & Nigiri. I like to taste the fish. When it's all wrapped up in a roll covered in sauces & tempura crunch, it can be very hard to tell if you're even getting a fresh piece of fish & that worries me a bit! \n\nThe 1st time we went, I had a hankering for Salmon terriyaki & was not really in the mood for sushi. Maybe only the 2nd time in my life that has ever happened! I did order the Poki appetizer & it was AH-mazing. The salmon terriyaki was good although the sauce was way too thick & there was too much of it covering the fish. If I order it again, I will definitely ask them to go easy on the sauce! Hubby ordered the AYCE & from what I could tell, he enjoyed every roll he had. \n\nThis last time we both had the AYCE & I will probably only do that from now on. It's a great value even if you don't eat very much & you can choose from hot & cold appetizers as well as all the sushi choices. I ordered the Poki again along with some Nigiri orders & even a couple of the \"fancy\" rolls, mainly b/c I already knew that their fish was fresh. I liked the Angry Ninja & the Sushi twister roll the best. I think I could eat that Japanese salsa all by itself.. yum!  \n\nI was slightly disappointed that they don't have fresh wasabi. Most of the better Sushi restaurants I've been to have it available for an extra charge so I was surprised they didn't have it. I have developed quite the affinity for it & can't really eat the stuff made from a powder anymore. I hope they consider making it available in the future & would be happy to pay an extra dollar or 2 to have some for my sushi. \n\nWe will be bringing the kids next time. Sushi gets very expensive when we go out as a family but the AYCE deal will make it much more reasonable & they will be thrilled.. \"anything we want?!\""

My sweetheart said the Sushi was good in last visits however it seems they have changed and the rolls that he liked are just not what they once were.\n\nOK so we gave it a shot and it disappointed unfortunately, and I am surprised because the reviews and star rating on Yelp are pretty good so?\n\nI do have to say the service was very good, we sat at the bar and they had our rolls whipped up in a jiffy and they kept up on our drink refills!"

They have someone that specifically is for refilling drinks and clearing plates so as soon as you pick up your last piece of sushi your plate is being picked up and our glasses never get under half full!! Sometimes the wait staff can be a little overwhelmed with tables but you never have to wait too long to order your next rolls!! It's a small restaurant but not as small as some sushi places I've been to in town, and defiantly worth the wait if you have to hang out for a few minutes before your table is ready.

Going back to my sushi expert friends, they really only like nigiri but apparently the rolls here utilize the same great fish that's on the nigiri that they don't mind having a few specialty rolls as well.\n\nNow, I am by no means an expert on sushi but when the food is good.. the food is good and the food here is DAMN good.\n\nMy only real problem with this place is unlike Sushi-Mon and the newly opened Goyemon, Twister does not offer all you can eat dessert which is a real bummer since I would love to have like 4-5 pieces of mochi ice cream like I normally do at Sushi-Mon as opposed to the one piece that they cut in half to make two at Twister.\n\nFortunately for them, I won't remove a star because like I have been saying.. the food is f^&#ing good. :)\n\nFor out of towners. This is not within reasonable driving distance of the strip so unless you're staying for a while and you're with other locals.. I wouldn't suggest it. It would be worth the drive if you have the time though."

My husband loves their seared albacore.  They make us special order rolls.\n\nThey also have a frequent AYCE diner card so you get a free meal when you fill up the card.  Sign up for their birthday club and they mail you a discount postcard during your birthday month."

The seafood salad also looked and smelled fresh and delicious.  Everything we had was good except the Japanese salsa.  So unless you like a sour taste, stay away from anything with that on it."

Average everything else  \n\nBoulder crunch - could only really taste the avocado and the eel sauce. Would not recommend \n\nAre you ready - it really is spicy. And I can handle a good amount. That said, it's an ok roll. Can't really taste the roll through all the spicyness. \n\nLasagna - too mushy. Couldn't really taste the flavors\n\nHamachi (yellowtail) - tasty.

It is located in a plaza on Tropicana and Boulder Highway, it's pretty far east compared to everything else I go to (which is usually somewhere on the west side of town). \n\nPlain and simple, they have one of the top quality fish in town with very good cuts. I would have to say they are on par with sushi restaurants I go to in Japan. Nothing is precut beforehand, they cut as they go. The fish are cut to the right thickness, not thin by any means, and the rice is minimal. \n\nDo be careful if you do not like wasabi, you must tell them to NOT put it in the sushi as they prepare it with a bit. \n\nI eat the same thing over and over usually which is ikura, tamago, and masago. I do have the ama ebi, ebi, tako, and sometimes salmon. I have yet to be disappointed by anything here. \n\nThe AYCE is the typical prices you see around town about $27 for dinner at $22 for lunch. Completely worth it, even if you don't like sushi, you can choose from a wide range of appetizers that are delicious! They do have rolls but I go for the nigiri sushi and some appetizers. \n\nThe UNLV Japanese Student Association uses Sushi Twister when they host their sushi nights at UNLV to enrich students in the culture of Japan and such. It is a big hit and good advertisement for them."

However after reading Mike B's review, where he gave it a five star, I thought I should try this place out. Not bad for a non traditional or non authentic sushi restaurant.\n\na.  Location - 3 star - Near my office, located on Boulder and Trop across from Sam's Town.  I like it because there are not too many great places on this portion of town to go.  However, I cannot give this place higher as this place location is not run down, however, it does not feel totally safe. \n\nb.  Service - 4 star I rate the service first as this is what you first encounter.  When the service does not seem to be Japanese I actually get a bit confused and wonder what I am in for.  However, I will gtive the service 4 star as I am reviewing this restaurant and an AYCE style place and let's face it, if it has those complex rolls, it is a non-traditional sushi restaurant.\n\nc.  Food - 4 star.  My rating scale for any sushi restaurant is based on traditional foods and then I order all that big mac rolls that these places serve. Yep, I like those goofy rolls.\n\n- Amaiebi - Sweet Shrimp Nigiri Style sushi . Not bad, came out quickly and nice proportion of ebi and rice.  However, I have to seriously question this as they do NOT serve this dish traditionally where they cut off the shrimp heads and then deep fry the heads and serve them after. This means that where they are buying their shrimp is where the heads are not attached? Or perhaps not live?  Let's face it, if you are service LIVE shrimp it will have the heads on them.  It is a way traditionalists know how fresh the seafood is.  In this case, no head, not fresh.  THREE STAR!.\n\n- Maguro- Again, my standard is ordering fatty tuna nigiri style with a thin slice of lemon and jalapeno.  This is a great dish if the slices of lemon and jalapeno are thinly sliced and in this case, it was absolutely not only thinly sliced, it was the jalapeno was artistically done.  FIVE STAR. \n\n- Uni - The Sea Urchin was absolutely great, nice texture and flavorful.  FIVE STAR.\n\n- All the other westernized rolls - I ate a lot of these and enjoyed them for what they were.  Nothing really stood out for me, mainly due to the amount of flavors.  They have many that are \"level 4,5\" in spice index and I had these and they were not too spicy.  So I would recommend it. THREE STAR.\n\nAs the sister restaurant to Ramen Sora in Chinatown, i would say it is cool that they have a sushi place on the far east side of town. There must be great demand for it.   They have a 60 minute limit on AYCE, and mainly due to fact that they have limited seating and it does get busy.  Overall, nice place, I can absolutely recommend this place and it is somewhere I will come back to for sure."

This spot is at a convenient location off of Boulder Highway. Not the greatest part of town, but not particularly bad. \n\nThe price is basically inline with other sushi joints, a dollar or two more than others. However, $26.95 (which is precisely what I paid here) gives me a large sake and superior sushi at Jayde Fuzion inside the M Hotel. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n-The Screaming for Vengeance roll is a top 3 roll in Vegas. Excellent. (and I'm more of a nigiri/sashimi guy)\n-Server (owner, I believe) very attentive\n-Sushi Chefs were also very attentive, skilled\n-Booze was cheap. I paid $5 for a large Sapporo - $10 elsewhere. \n======================================================\nTHE SO-SO:\n-Music was constantly skipping throughout our meal. Very annoying. Also, half the songs were Cher remixes. I'm sorry, but no one wants to listen to Cher remixes.. I understand that technical issues can at times be out of your hands, but you should turn down the volume if the music is constantly skipping\n\n-Was very warm sitting at the bar. I was sweating. \n\n-Fairly bland fish - we ordered about ten flavors of Nigiri, most were less flavorful than competitors in town. Taste-wise, it was on par with my at home nigiri that I make from store bought fish. It just didn't taste very flavorful\n======================================================\nTHE BAD: \n-HOT PLATES- My NUMBER ONE pet peeve with sushi restaurants is serving sushi on hot plates. No no no. It ruins the flavor, the experience, and the build of the nigiri. Every dish I was served here was on hot plates. No one wants warm raw fish. \n\n-Nagged three times regarding the policy of finishing food. My girlfriend and I weigh 250lbs combined(she's at about 90lbs). We're thin. We know that this is an established rule at every AYCE joint, and we follow it 100% of the time. Never leave a morsel of food on our plate. We ordered a total of two rolls and ten (2pc) orders of Nigiri. If we had ordered those plates individually, it would have came out to less than we paid for the AYCE. And ON TOP OF THAT, we ate everything. She reminded us once when we sat, once mid-meal, and when I asked for the check with two pieces we were sitting on, she mentioned that we needed to finish them (we were already planning on it). It's printed on every menu and all over their signs at Sushi Twister. I thought it was excessive before she even said anything to us, let alone before she told us three times. No other Sushi joint needs to mention it. \n\nWe were certainly the smallest AYCE order on the day. More profitable than any other customers that walked through the door. But really, she shouldn't be mentioning it to anyone. It's on the menu. We get it."

It's next to Starbucks and is near the 7-Eleven gas station on Boulder and Tropicana. One of my friends wanted to eat here last night, and I agreed since I most likely haven't been back here in over a year.\n\nThe appetizers are pretty good. Aurora shrimp are fried and breaded shrimp with a mayo-based sauce, and they really hit the spot if you're into that sort of thing. Their version of baked mussels either has little or none of the creamy sauce, but instead draw flavor from a dark sweet sauce. The sea eel tempura, which I don't recall trying before, is tasty and has the eel flavor but without as much of the typical sweetness of eel sauce. The tuna poke could've used more tuna but was otherwise a decent rendition. The screaming orgasm was delicious and had extra crunch from the tobiko (flying fish roe) mixed into the ubiquitous sauce.\n\nThe nigiri options are solid, although I'm always disappointed that super white tuna is not a standard option. It did make an appearance last night a special, and it did taste nice in spite of being topped with a sauce. I wasn't able to try it prepared sauceless because they ran out, which wasn't that shocking since it was late. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the limited nigiri options were. The sweet shrimp were flavorful and didn't feel mushy (and the fried heads were also nice), and the uni was above average for AYCE. While it wasn't the best that I've tasted on an AYCE menu, it wasn't discolored and didn't have any off-putting flavors. I only recall tasting salmon and tako among the other nigiri options, and both were also good.\n\nI didn't have that much room left, so I kept myself to half rolls. I had to get my \"namesake\" Chris roll, which is shrimp tempura with eel on top. It was as good as I'd remembered. Sadly, I failed at reading comprehension and didn't enjoy my remaining choices. Mind you, they weren't bad in and of themselves, but the Cowgirl was entirely vegetarian inside and only had some seared beef on top, and the baked roll Alaskan Summer was not the best meal-ending option for me because it has a spicy yum yum sauce, rather than a standard yum yum sauce.\n\nOne reason that I've avoided returning is the limit of one dessert per person, and that hasn't changed. The mango mochi was an easy choice, and it's the standard mochi that you'll find anywhere. It was yummy, but I prefer having several desserts with AYCE sushi.\n\nI was happy with the flavor and quality (AYCE-wise) of all of my orders, so perhaps I'll be back to Sushi Twister more often than once a year. It's quite a solid restaurant, but for those who don't live nearby, it's not destination-worthy. I'd only recommend it if you're exploring all that Vegas has to offer or if you've somehow tired of all the other places."

But do you have to be such Nazis about the AYCE rules? \nYour are already one of the more expensive AYCE in town, I've been here 1000 x's, yes I know No SHARING , Eat RICE, No leftovers & you are going to swoop around my table checking my progress if you think I have ordered too much. \nThe fish is good quality, I give you that...but when nearly every roll is fully fried or involves SOMETHING fried, it isn't really fresh anymore anyway right? \nI like how the menu is set up with \n*baked rolls\n*fried rolls (even tho, again almost everything has shrimp tempura or crumb)\nBUT when ordering AYCE thu almost always immediately take away your menu & give you the paper one which does not show even HALF of the appetizers &\nEven some rolls available w AYCE! If you are on this side of town, go for it....but there are friendly, TASTIER AYCE places closer to town!"

I dont like scallops but I recommend trying Dynamite which is Baked scallops on a half shell and they still come out frying to your table. DELIC. And i love how most rolls come out in half portions if you request it so you can try more. There is one with Mango sauce on top OMG it was great. And they give you a stamp card.

I was there for lunch one day and I sat at the bar in front of the owner. Everything was going fine until his friend showed up with his own fish. The owner started to cut his friends fish and setting up sashimi plates right in front of me and decided to completely ignore all my orders after. He started to give my orders to the guy next to him. It sucked I left with great disappointment. So I decided to never sit in front of him again like I told myself last time. I went in there with my family and wanted to sit at the bar. We waited for about an hour for a spot at the bar because it appeared that again the owner was serving his friend and somebody who appeared to be his brother. I have spend thousands of dollars at this place and I do not get treated well there. We still did not get to sit at the bar and that was it. I am never going there again... I left and found another all you can eat spot that night. Sin city sushi is off of Eastern in Henderson just south of the 215. To my surprise when I walked in. JIMBO!! the old owner of Mandas that use to be on Sahara :) If any of know sushi in Vegas that was one of the most popular spots in Vegas.  The service was outstanding unlike twister and I recommend that everybody that goes to twister to try this place it is so much better and the service is great!"

She said she can't serve us unless we paid the bill. No one in my party did this on purpose someone just forgot since some people where paying for each other. She stayed there telling us it was the young woman who was with us and we need to pay if we want to eat. I've been coming to sushi twister for 5 years now and have never been treated this way! We told her take the card and charge it if that's what you want. It was only 30 dollars. We weren't arguing that we didn't want to pay she just approached us very unprofessionally! She literally kept our photo copy receipts in the front just waiting for us to come through the door! In the end we told her charge the card it was probably my friends mom who forgot and the manager was like \"no it wasn't her so I'm not gonna charge you then.\" She made us go through this whole ordeal and embarrass us and in the end didn't even want the payment.

Not too salty and it was flavorful. The salad was yum. It wasn't a typical ginger dressing, but it wasnt that sweet poppy stuff some places use. I would have liked a bit more but it was a lunch portion, so I can't complain. The rolls were good. I wish the crab wasn't the \"mush\" it was, but the rice was REAL good. The wasabi seemed \"muted\". I like it nice and spicy and when I put a big glob on my roll, my nose immediately opens up. It wasn't the case here but it was good. The tempura was delicious. Not greasy at all and I love love the pumpkin squash. LOVE IT! The carrot was perfect and so was the broccoli. I will definitely come back here when I am in the neighborhood. Very good!

Since it was my first time & my friend was bragging about how good the sushi is, we did mostly half rolls. This is probably the most sushi I've ever tried in one sitting :P Thank goodness for those half rolls! Anyway, the server was helpful & attentive. Right when you come in there is an anti-bacterial foam dispenser :) We were sitting in the middle of the restaurant at one of the higher tables. I don't remember them having a tv, but they did have a projector screen above the entry to the restrooms. They also have a Sushi Twister point card; after 10 all you can eat purchases you get one free~\n\nNigiri garlic tuna - it tastes just how it's described. delicious :P\n\nN.Z. Mussels - not big on mussels, but the eel sauce & cream cheese made it taste better for me!\n\nCall a doctor VS Friday the 13th - the sauces come on the side, but I really enjoyed this roll. it took me another 5 minutes to take another piece, but it was great. the habanera [isn't it habanerO? hm] is what got me\n\nEcstasy - I barely remember this roll because the Call a dr. was still burning my mouth. haha, but I know it was tasty! Spicy tuna with cucumber inside with more tuna on top\n\nSpider Man - soft shell crab, cucumber, crab meat thats deep fried with eel sauce always gets me ;) dont forget the shrimp on top!!\n\nAngry Ninja - this was new to the menu, same as the ninja roll but with habanera sauce on top. I dont know why, but that habanera sauce always felt like it was burning UNDER my tongue too. haha, weird\n\nMagic Mountain - super duper light. there was barely any rice in this roll, so if you wana take a break with the carbs, eat this!!\n\nCrispy Vacation - Most of the time I have soy sauce with my sushi, but this was the ONLY roll I dipped into soy sauce. Not as much flavor as I wanted, but then again those spicy rolls were probably still messing with my taste buds :/\n\nJapanese Lasagna - This was my friend's favorite roll & he always gets it when we eat sushi. Honestly, they taste the same to me cause there's so much going on. I'm not hating though! I prefer to eat the baked rolls when I'm juust about to get full\n\nSalmon Loves Lemon - I don't remember ever having a roll like this, but it was good! The sourness from the lemon was perfect since the lemon slice was super thin :9\n\nVolcano - same description as Japanese lasagna.. and I have never had these many rolls in one sitting! BLAH\n\nOh My God - having soft shell crab & eel sauce is cheats! haha, I enjoyed it & my friend said \"it lives up to it's name.. OMG!!\"\n\nFor dessert we had mango mochi ice cream & green tea ice cream. By this time I'm ready to explode from all the sushi. I went into the women's restroom [no, I did not #2 in the restroom! haha]. The signs on the door are so cute btw! But it was very clean & even had a nice floral scent in there. Sushi Twister, you had me at the foam hand sanitizer!! I will return with my boyfriend asap."

Simply the service wasn't good. For example, order a diet coke to drink, waitress bring iced tea, no big deal, but to have to remind her twice isn't good.\n\nAnd the biggee, a pet hate of mine, unlisted food items in a meal, not a big deal to most people, but to those with alergies it can be very dangerous, as such I asked what came on my dish, steak, rice, soup and salad (told you its good value) of course the part that wasn't mentioned just happens to be the dangerous food for me, onions, luckly they were in plain sight, so no issues, again an issue mainly for me, but still something that even McDonald's can get right."

I can't go to Monta anymore because the tall Japanese girl who works there figured out who I am and she has been treating me real bad since I posted that bad review about the place. \nI can't go to Shuseki anymore because it turns out the psycho old man from Ichiza eats there every night, and he is still pissed off at me because a few months ago  I made a very unflattering impersonation of him. \nI don't want to go to Anime Ramen anymore because ever since Ryosuke went back to Japan, the service and food has been bad. I hope he comes back soon. \nSo, I was just about to go to Yagyu for Ramen when I remembered that SUSHI TWISTER is owned by the same dude who owns RAMEN SORA. So in my head I was like: \"Maybe Sushi Twister will have Miso Ramen since they are owned by the Sora people!\". The very thought of me eating AYCE Sushi and Sapporo Style Ramen at the same time overstimulated my brain. I was very disappointed when I arrived at TWISTER to see no Ramen on the menu. But, after ordering two pieces of Nigiri and having a great conversation with the Japanese sushi chefs, my disappointment left instantly. \n\nThis place actually has AYCE TORO! I have NEVER seen that before. But according to one of the workers, the AYCE TORO is like a random promotion. Some days when you show up they will have it, but most days they won't have it. So coming here for the AYCE TORO special is like gambling. \n\nThe Tuna nigiri has the highest quality Tuna I have seen in years. It wasn't even Toro but it had that fatty marbling. The fish was so shinny that the light reflected off it like a shard of glass. The Tuna literally just instantly melts inside your mouth. \n\nThe Eel Sauce with my Unagi was very strong. I don't know how they get the sauce to have that certain kind of deepness. \n\nI love places that make their own tempura sauce. Places that use that generic bottled stuff suck. SUSHI TWISTER has possibly the best Tempura sauce I have ever had. \n\nThey got the best Sushi Rice on the face of the earth. It's seasoned perfectly! Many people don't have the sophistication to notice small details like that, but because I am so awesome I can.\n\nMy personal favorite \"Ichiro Mashita\" roll is the Dead Dragon. You should try it! \n\nI also want to point out that this is the only AYCE Sushi place I have ever been to that puts wasabi in the nigri. Other AYCE Sushi places don't do this because they market their restaurant towards \"westerners\". \n\nI am actually really happy that I came here today. I had a very entertaining conversation with the a chef named Hiro. And all the workers were really great to me. \n\nWhen it comes to AYCE Sushi, Goyemon can't touch this place. Also, I rather come to small independent places like SUSHI TWISTER or SUSHI ON RAINBOW any day over one of Martin Kollefs multi-million dollar bankrolled hipster/douchebag sushi orgy places.\n\nUPDATE OCT- I've lowered the rating from 5 stars to 4 because one of the sushi chefs accused me of being \"HOOTO\". When I told him that I didn't know what that was, he began to describe the person. Eventually I figured out that he meant Hootie B.... I was like: Are you f*cking joking? Do I look like a middle aged man with a Korean wife? Apparently, he thought I was \"Hooto\" because I told him about how most people on Yelp want to kill me. Don't get me wrong. I am a big fan of Hooto reviews and his Sysco comments always have me rolling on the floor laughing, but how the hell do you confuse me as him?"

I went here because the yelp reviews were good. here's the low down.\n\n1. went for lunch  around 2pm today price $21.99 for all you can eat sushi.\n\n2. the selection was good including a wide a sortment of appetizers and rolls.\n\n3. Tried my favorite roll rainbow it was okay, too much rice so we stopped ordering rolls and went straight for the nigiri.\n\n4. the seared tuna and garlic tuna, halibut were great. The eel anago was good also.\n\n5. your all you can eat sushi includes dessert, red bean ice cream good stuff.\n\nWhy did i give them only 2 stars, it's service the wait staff who took your appetizer orders were good. but the sushi chef started out nice but kinda of ignored us seeing that we eat a lot. Last time I check I payed for all you can eat. We did'nt exceed the time limit which is 45 min for lunch. Also the fact that me and my friend were the only ones in the restaurant, there were two sushi chefs and they were extremely slow, like I said we felt like we were being ignored after few orders. It's like you bastards eat too much so it's time for you to go. Hint hint. The food is good but because of that factor I could not reccomend this place unless all options were closed.\nOnly bright thing the sushi chef did give us couple of blue fin tuna nigiri but so what, in the end its the service that keeps you coming back. You dont know how many friends i have that eat sushi that could pop up you business. \n\n\"\"\"I hope that the owners read this review and change their attitude because why advertise all you can eat in 45 min if your not gonna honor it, towards the end i felt like i had to beg the sushi chefs for more. Also island sushi lunch is 1.5 hours double the time of sushi twister and they were so nice and the food was unbelievable****\n\n\nHonestly I would have given this place 4 or 5 stars if it was'nt for the service. You advertise all you can eat, it better be all you can eat without the guilt."

I've had 2 personal friends rave about it, so I ran in (in slippers) and grabbed a menu. I decided on the Boulder Crunchy, the 9-1-1, and the jalape\u00f1o popper. The 9-1-1 was my favorite.

The quality has remained excellent, some of the chefs are extremely pleasant and the rest are still efficient, amicable enough fellows albeit more focused on creating the sushi at hand. All of the servers have been quite friendly and cheerful enough, so we've always felt welcomed when dining here. If you order the amaebi they may offer you the deep fried heads as well- I for one fully suggest consuming those crunchy little craniums, they're delicious! Their screaming orgasm wiz a twist is, naturally, tastegasmic, though if I'm going to be totally earnest I'm enamored with any dish that combines thin shreds of crunchy daikon with a savory soy and mayo sauce. Their baked mussels are fabulous, as is their sea eel tempura. The quality and flavor of the uni and ikura have yet to fail me, and their octopus and hokki are consistently fresh with appealing and appropriate mouthfeel. My boyfriend is quite fond of their ika tempura, which has a sweet chili sauce, while I very much enjoy their seaweed salad. \n\nYummy, consistently fresh food in a welcoming environment in an unexpected location.\n\nThey offer happy hour deals where some of their more popular menu items are available ala carte at discounted prices. \n\nYou can also opt for a LARGE beer, in a glass that's at least 10\" tall!\n\nGochisousama deshita!"

It was fresh and tasty; next time, I'll ask for a bit more \"spicy,\" though, because it was more mild than spicy to me. Next I ordered hamachi (yellowtail) nigiri, and it was perfectly cold and melted in my mouth. I was intrigued by the Dead Dragon roll so finished my lunch with a half order - avocado, shrimp tempura and eel all wrapped up in a roll, tempura-battered and deep-fried, and drizzled with eel sauce.

Because I'm a slow eater and have odd eating hours, I ordered it to go.

The dynamite appetizer of baked scallops, onions and mushrooms is TO DIE FOR. Also the screaming orgasm of fresh raw fish chunks. Yum. My mouth is starting to water just thinking about the fish here. \n\nHonestly I have been to SO MANY AYCE sushi places, including the famous Sushi Mon in Silverado Ranch. This place is better. If it was closer to my house, I would be here at least once a week."

We ordered the first round of nigiri, it had no Wasabi in it. Then when we ordered the second round, they put Wasabi underneath the fish and rice like the traditional way. Then the third round, no wasabi. Kinda weird. Tuna was try, Hamachi was slimey. \nEverything was bland or tasted like sushi I could get at Smiths. There were also bugs on the wall and trash on the floor. I mean, it's right across the street from Crack castle. What did I expect, really. \nI'll stick to blue fin when I'm on the east side."

Now don't be scared if someone hits you up for a cigarette or try to sell you fake flowers, but push beyond that to the sushi goodness! \n\nI haven't done the ayce here, but my love is the sashimi plate. They have beautiful cuts of fish. I also love that they have a small and large option when it comes to the sashimi plates. For you ayce lovers they also will do half rolls!! \nIf you are looking for something to accompany your sushi I suggest the Dynamite. It has scallops coupled with mushrooms and beautifully caramelized onions that totally add a sweetness to the dish. \nIf you are looking to kick back a couple cocktails they do offer many beers. They are super reasonably priced.\n I've had their house Plum Wine and their Plum champagne. I definitely prefer the champagne. It has a much lighter and fruitier taste. It does pair well with the sashimi in my opinion. \n\nThe staff! Omg nicest people ever. Plus, they definitely have a sense of humor. I've knocked over several of their plastic menu stands and they are always nice about it and joke with me. They are even kind to my father who tends to get messy with his soy sauce and wasabi mixing. Plus, their music selection is spot on!!!! Props on that. It's something that definitely sets the tone for a dining experience.\n\nI think this place is spot on with everything I've tried! I look forward to trying more."

I decided to try a couple of nigiri sushi and half a roll of Matsuri.\n\nSushi Twister is located on the corner of Tropicana and Boulder Highway.  It's next to the gas station and shares the building with Starbucks.  \n\nService was really fast.  The sushi chef was very friendly.  \n\nMy first two orders were the salmon nigiri and the garlic tuna nigiri.  Both really fresh pieces of fish.  What I really liked about the nigiris is how firm the fish and rice are (they did not fall apart) AND the small piece of wasabi they add in the middle of the nigiri!  If you eat it all in one piece, you are sure to clear your sinuses!  My favorite part of the nigiri experience is definitely the surprise piece of wasabi!\n\n\nLast, I got a half order of the Matsuri - four rolls of shrimp tempura, cucumber, tuna, drenched in Ecstasy sauce.  Ecstasy sauce contains fish eggs, mayo, ponzu, and I believe a little bit of chilli oil.  No need to dip it in soy sauce...the ecstasy sauce was amazing!  \n\nI really like how they offer both regular and half rolls, especially for times when I want to try more nigiri sushi than regular sized rolls."

The staff is responsive and most importantly, the fish is REALLY fresh!

We ordered about 7 different things right away, and ordered more rolls after that. The server kept telling us we could order half rolls, as if he didnt think we could finish the full rolls. Ha! We sure showed him! But it is nice they have the half roll option. \n\nThe salmon loves lemon roll is deliciously refreshing, if you like lemon and salmon you must get this. The salmon nigiri and garlic tuna were my favorite of the evening, and I love that garlic sauce they use on top of the tuna. For dessert I had mango mochi and red bean ice cream. The red bean was super sweet and tasty. Just a note only one piece of mochi per person for AYCE, which I think is a little stingy. After all you are paying around $30 for dinner with tax.  I would recommend this place for sushi if you are in the area."

Kitchen looks a bit chaotic/seedy but they did a good job of making the dining room pleasant (mainly paint the ceiling black and use minimal quality lighting.) \n\nWe had to wait twice as long as stated on a weekday evening about 7.  Got the AYCE (seems pretty standard around Vegas to have the $26.95 AYCE in many sushi places.)  Quality of fish was decent, about what I get for a middle of the road type place in Seattle.  I like that they didn't give you tons of rice in each piece.  Sat at the bar.  After I hit about $35 equivalent value, the chef was definitely not as attentive and you had to be more assertive about ordering more.  Could be he just got busy too.  Was impressed AYCE includes one order of sweet shrimp and Uni (if you want it.)  \n\nItems off the regular menu; scallop dynamite: NASTY - a pool of oil.  Green salad - way too much dressing, couldn't eat it, and it's the spring greens not the crisp iceberg lettuce I'm used to getting in most traditional Japanese places. Tempura Bowl, good, a little on the overdone side and the pour the sauce on instead of giving you a dipping bowl.  Agedashi tofu, good.  \n\nService, okay.

We noticed that in the past it was \"hit and miss\" few times on the quality and customer service but we hung in there. Today we arrive at 3:30 so we decided to try something different. The place was quiet with two other couples already dining. My husband ordered a \"bowl \" and I ordered a combo lunch, chicken and tempura with 4 pieces of sushi,soup and salad.We both get our soup and a few minutes later my husband gets his bowl and starts to eat after 5 minutes we inquired about my lunch and was  told it was coming right out. After my husband finished his bowl and was done I was still waiting. The wait staff never approached us for any refills and never came with my lunch. After a 1/2 hour we got up paid the bill and told them we will never be back... And my lunch still wasn't done!"

I am a tough critic when it comes to fish....whether it's raw or cooked, I can only eat it fresh. I will literally gag if I'm served previously frozen fish.\n\nWith that said, Sushi Twister is not only awesome for serving fresh fish, but the AYCE concept just blows my mind. How can they serve such great quality fish at such reasonable prices? I mean, $30 per person for AYCE sushi AND kitchen ala carte items?! What?\n\nAnyway, everything I ate was good. I especially liked the toro, uni, and amaebi nigiri sushi. I'm not into maki sushi but the oh my god roll which consisted of scallops, crab, and yum yum sauce was really delicious. And the agedashi tofu and hamachi kama from the kitchen menu was cooked to perfection!\n\nService was great, ambience is perfect, and always a good time at Sushi Twister."

Generally we love to do AYCE and have tried a lot of them throughout the LV valley. So this time we decided to give Sushi Twister a try for AYCE since it was late and we didn't feel like driving too far.  The sushi was ok but none of which were fantastic; this time we also tried the Angry Ninja (new item) , ecstasy & Matsuri.  The place was very busy and at first the waitress seemed very nice but as the evening wore on, she forgot an order and wasn't as nice.. maybe it was because we had 3 toddlers with us. Well we were a party of 4 adults and 3 children all under 3yrs of age.  At the end of dinner, my husband gave his mochi ice cream to 2 of the toddlers and the waitress came over and yelled NO SHARING! you cannot share with the little kids!  My goodness that was just 1 little mochi ice cream ball and she made a big deal about it and embarrassed us at the restaurant.  Food wise we would rate them a 3 star because the sushi was ok but not outstanding.  The best place we love for AYCE or not is SIN SITY SUSHIi, I love Sushi is also very good but they do not offer AYCE.  We took off 1 star from our overall rating because we will not give this place our time or money anymore because of the incident with the mochi ice cream and also because they included the 3 kids in our party total and automatically added 18% gratuity.  I don't think this place is kid friendly.  From now on, I would rather spend my money on gas and drive 20 minutes for fresh and great tasting sushi as well as outstanding service other than Sushi Twister."

Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype :(  it's about $3 more expensive than most other sushi places for ayce dinner and I wouldn't mind paying it if the food was better, b it it's not. I can easily think of 3 better places that are cheaper. Also, the ambiance just isn't there. Decor seems like more of an afterthought and thrown together, music was atrocious.  It was a variety station of crappy 90's and early 2000's music, and none of the songs you liked from then either, and the rap was edited to top it off.  I'll give them an A+ for service, our server was a total sweetheart and very on the ball. The sushi, was just missing something,  the fish was fresh enough but it seemed of a lower quality than somewhere like Yama ( too bad they have terrible service).  Sorry twister, won't be back. I'll drive across town to Daisho, they have good food and good service."

So I knew the perfect place to tame the wild beasts of a family was the one and only, Sushi Twister!  It is also owned by Ramen Sora in Chinatown.\n\nThe trip was a little farther than our home. It was on the other side of town and in a sketchy area. As we got there, we were disappointed and excited because of the long wait in line. It took 20 minutes! But once we got inside, the waitress brought our drinks in a jiffy. Now comes the sushiness you've been waiting for!\n\nSo we started with a large order from the AYCE menu, the long wait had starved us. We got the usual rolls like caterpillar, dragon, and lots of salmon nigiri along with some of  their special rolls like the tiger yamazaki and the sushi-twister and ninja. The \"salmon loves lemon\" was slightly tart when eating with the slivers of lemon, but was oh so good! The crispy vacation roll was crunchy from the garlic flakes with a nice bit of spicy from the tuna.  The orders came so fast that we had to order MORE! \n\nWe ordered the yellow mango with shrimp though the yellow mango was a bit overpowering. The baked scallop appetizer was a little too burnt on top and a bit oily for our taste. Baked mussels were also pleasing. The ordered chicken skewers brought us accidentally to another dish called the pork katsu with a tasteful sauce. All the rolls had good consistency.  The overall experience with the dishes were outstanding, just like the staff's fast and friendly service! \n\nThe interior of the place was a tad bit tight, thus creating the long line. There was a projector screen which had the Sochi Olympics showing. It was a nice size for entertainment. The atmosphere was busy and the chef's were making those great rolls. The prices are comparable in town with kids 8 and under for half the adult prices.\n\nOverall the service and sushi overcame the long wait and trip so I gave them 5 stars. In the end we came home happy, stuffed, and satisfied!"

You can order half rolls for all, except for the rolls that have soft shell crab. The menu is alphabetized and they also have the rolls by category (i.e. spicy, deep fried, baked, etc.). Dessert is included in the AYCE, limit of one for mochi ice cream. For the non sushi eaters, they have a full menu as well. If you are with a large group, this may not be the place for you as it is a tiny restaurant. Great date night place for couples and if you sit at the bar the chefs are all very entertaining.

I kind of miss the previous servers, they seemed more friendly than the ones now, but maybe because they're understaffed or something. I'm giving this place 5 stars because they always serve the freshest sushi and sashimi around. The other day they had oysters, not all you can eat though, sad to say, and that was soooo good, so fresh, you wonder where they got it from, seeing there's no large bodies of water for miles!! The prices are reasonable, both all you can eat ($21 lunch, $25 dinner) and menu items. Their lunch special is cheap ($8.95 for chicken teriyaki, soup, salad, California roll, and tempura) and the portion is good. A couple of  things I would like to request are: a changing table in the bathroom, since my girls' timings are always perfect! And another location in the west side or north side of town (Sushi Twister is located on the east side of town closer south) it is a bit of a drive for us to get to Sushi Twister, but we make the trip anyway just because it is well worth it."

Their tempura is light and tasty, although, they are a bit skimpy on the order size (they give you two per order, another place I go to gives you three).\n\nMy only quibble with this place is the service.  While they are nice, as another reviewer said, after a few plates of sushi, one gets the feeling that the wait staff as well as the sushi chef is ignoring you while thinking, \"Stop eating!\".  Some servers are better than others about that, but this is the one place I go where I feel like this is almost always an issue, whereas it is not with other sushi places I've been to.  I think that for the price they charge for an ACYE dinner, and accounting for the frequency of which I dine there (and always tip well), this is a bit uncalled for."

It's not buffet style (pre-made and slowly rotting as the unwashed masses touch the food and put it back when they change their minds), and instead you order from the waitress. It's great that this isn't a buffet and there's no time limit to ordering, but the bad side is that you can't just get food when you want it. This encourages people to order *a lot* at once and invariably the you end up with more food than your stomach can handle.\n\nThe rolls themselves are quite tasty, each one a mix of the basic fish (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) with other maki standards such as crab, avocado, tempura, sweet and/or spicy sauces, etc. You'll definitely find a few that you'll like given that there seem to be about 20 rolls on the menu. \n\nOn top of rolls and sushi, the AYCE allows you to order anything else they serve as well, so you could really gorge yourself on dumplings and salad if that was your fancy. I believe the only thing with a limit are the mochi ice creams of which you're only allowed one.  No big deal since by the time dessert rolled around, I was so stuffed that I involuntarily gave our nice waitress the stinkeye when she asked me if I wanted mochi as well.\n\nSushi Twister is fun with some interesting decor choices (why are there two carpet dryers on a display area near the ceiling???). The wait staff is super nice and friendly if a bit overworked when I went for a saturday lunch; there was only one girl working the whole restaurant.  I really do like this place and have come back quite a few times when visiting Vegas.\n\nJust remember that as with any type of AYCE, be ready for eater's remorse."

While there are a lot of people that rave about this place, I'm never quite in the same boat as they are.  Don't get me wrong.. the ambiance is great, the staff is friendly, and the location is awesome (about 15 minutes from my house and about 2 minutes away from my job) but the sushi doesn't cut it for me.  There are a few good rolls like the Freddy vs. Jason, Boulder Crunchy, and the Ecstasy roll but the majority of the rolls I didn't really find appealing.  I like the fact that they had low sodium soy sauce, good prices on Sake, and a giant screen projection for a movie or sporting event, but after going there a few times I'd rather stick to my usual hangouts.  On a side note, the chefs were pretty funny and just a tad bit obnoxious at times but that only added to the appeal of the Sushi Twister environment.  Not bad IMO but not enough to coax me back for another AYCE encounter with the \"Twister\"."

I'm a fan.\n\nI've been going to this place for a long, long, time. Years in fact. But like like all things, change is constant and Sushi Twister is not immune, \n\nWhile the food is always good, it's the service that has slowly become an issue. The primary reason for this, as I see it, is that they've simply outgrown their space. The place is too small. They need to expand (which is difficult given that they are on a shared pad with Starbucks with nowhere else to grow) or just plain move. I suppose moving would be a bad idea considering that they have a lock in this area as the only sushi place until you travel all the way down to Topaz and Tropicana or so.  \n\nRegardless, the place is simply too small. When it's busy, which is almost always nowadays, people are literally sitting on top of each other. In fact, I would almost call it communal seating. On my last visit I had a couple to my right that looked to be on their first date (I think they really hit it off!!) and a couple to my left that were an established pair. She was a straight shooter. He liked to tap his feet and hop up and down a little in his chair when the next plate of sushi showed up (he looked to be about 50 years old). He'd even hum a little ditty while he ate. Perhaps he did this for our mutual pleasure? I would have to assume so given that our shoulders were less than a foot apart.\n\nThe staff seems to be overcrowded, overworked and overwhelmed. They aren't nearly as chipper as they used to be. This might have to do with the lack of space and over capacity. Or perhaps it's something else. It might be that they've become so busy that a customers business is no longer appreciated, but expected? This is a mindset that seems to occur from time to time when an establishment become wildly popular. \n\nPurely speculation of course and I certainly hope I'm wrong. Overall the place is awesome and the food is fantastic. If they can work out these couple of kinks they'll be back to old form in a jiffy."

About 15 minutes after we ordered the waitress informed us that we could not bring outside food or drinks in to the restaurant. I explained that our son does not eat anything on their menu but she insisted that it was a their restaurant rule. How INCONSIDERATE of their customers children!!! My husband had to take my son's snack to the car. We wanted to just get up & go but another waitress was already bringing our order to the table, we were hungry and we did not want to be rude and make a scene. I  was very disappointed of this place. They should have mentioned their stupid rule when we walked in the door or when the waitress took our drink order. But they waited until we ordered our food. We would visit often and I introduced many of my work buddies to this place. Since this incident I have only been back to this place about 3 times in the last 2 years & only because its the closest to my home. Before the incident we would eat here at least twice a month. But thanks to that I found another sushi place that is my new favorite and their staff is amazingly courteous and understanding, Kabuki in Town Square. A must try!!"

Great pricing for the all-you-can-eat at lunch or dinner. They will fill you up.\n\nI recommend the Salmon Loves Lemon, the Spiderman and the Oh My God! rolls.\n\nI just took a friend from LA/Iowa to the place a couple of days ago and he thought it was excellent."

Grill salmon with teriyaki chicken twister special for $8.95 it came with miso soup rice and 1/2 cali roll. Ok, first the sushi chefs here are really good and I do not want everyone to confuse them with the hot food cooks.  My only complaint is please clean the bloodline out of the salmon before you cook it. Second, if you are going to leave the skin on the grilled salmon great. BUT, don't cover the Krispy skin with a glaze. \n\nAlso, the servers need to bus their tables more often.  We hate sitting for 25 min with empty plates in front of us. Advice, for the owner/manager hire a busser for your busy times, you will turn tables faster.  All in all its a great place for sushi, lunch and dinner we will continue to eat at sushi twister"

Unfortunately for us they close at 11, so coming late in the evening we were left with an hour or so to eat. When we were seated our waitress seemed a little annoyed, which was just really upsetting. She stressed that the kitchen would be closing in 45 minutes and that she would just rather have us acye-ers place all of our orders at once. We did just that. She made frequent visits to the table and occasionally threw in comments such as, \"Anything else? We all want to go home, you know.\"  No one at my table seemed to take offense, but I, however, found it very disrespectful. The restaurant was not yet closing so for her to just hate her life and take it out on poor, innocent customers was just rude.  \n\nIt's unfortunate because the food was pretty good. I just can't get over the fact that our server had such a foul attitude the whole evening. It's like: Relax and smile a little. Everything's going to be OK. They have set such low standards for customer service that I can't bring myself to rate them more than three stars. Regardless of how good their food was. Meh. Sorry, not sorry."

But I can't say enough good things about this place. \n\nThis place deserves more than just a 5-pack of stars. They really deserve buckets and troughs of the things. Big, shiny, red, buckets of obese stars. Get you, your mouth, and your tummy over here immediately. You really cannot wait any longer. If you find yourself in Vegas doing the strip-thing, you need to make the ~10 minute drive to Sushi Twister.  \n\nThree initial must-dos: AYCE, sit at the bar, and come hungry. \n\nOne initial tip: Order carefully, they will charge you for any leftovers you cannot finish. (Great policy in my opinion). \n\nThe man-piece and I came here for lunch before our long road-trip back home to San Francisco. It was probably the best decision of our lives. For around $22, we sat at the bar and enjoyed gorgeously delicious waves of fresh, expertly prepared sushi, and other wonderfully unique dishes. \n\nWe mainly stuck to the nigiri menu. I'm not saying this is what you should do, but these little guys aren't your typical nigiri (and I live in San Francisco, a veritable sushi-snob space station). They really surpassed anything I have experienced. Expect fresh fish (weird, being in the middle of the desert), and really amazing flavors. They are garnished with the perfect amount of wasabi, sometimes green onions, and various soy-ish sauces that give your wee nigiri bites extra-excellent flavor. We probably tried 80% of the nigiri menu, but some must-haves include: \n\n- Garlic tuna (FAVORITE)\n- Seared ahi (OTHER FAVORITE) \n- Halibut (OTHER FAVORITE)\n- Sake (FAVORITE)\n- Saba (OTHER FAVORITE)\n- Red snapper (OTHER FAVORITE)\n\nBefore I continue to gush about the food, I must say that the service was spectacular. As soon as we walked in, we were taken aback by the 7-9 people enthusiastically declaring \"IRASSHAIMASE!!!\" I twitched a little at the loud enthusiasm, but we knew we were in for a treat. The servers always check up on you, the chefs are wonderfully receptive, seem to love their work, and also seem to have fortress-like memories considering the slew of orders being verbally submitted by the servers. Be comforted. \n\nBack to the food! \n\nThe roll menu is impressive and involves unique combinations that I'm not used to. They have a great array of cooked rolls, of which we liked the Dead Dragon, Fire Cracker, . Use caution here -- I can see it being easy to fill up on these delicious rolls and be too full to enjoy other areas of the glorious menu. \n\nI'm not usually one for appetizers mainly because they fill me up before I get to the good stuff, but these appetizers are cautiously portioned so you can enjoy a variety of dishes and flavors but still have room in your precious tummy-space for more. Favorites: \n\n- Monkey Balls: spicy tuna and mushroom encased in a satisfying tempura shell. Nothing like their Chimp Nad cousins. (I suck.)\n- Hot Shrimp: shrimp, spicy tuna, and cream cheese magicked with tempura to make a seriously delicious snack. You must try.\n\nNeedless to say, the man-piece and I were speechless after our meal here. It's both a gut-wrenching tragedy and a wallet-saving blessing that it's so far away from where we live. That said, I can't really complain much hailing from the sushi-space-station that is San Francisco. Sushi Twister should think about storming its way up to the Bay. You'd be welcomed with open arms and mouths. Thank you for a truly excellent and memorable meal!"

I love it in the morning, I love it in the afternoon, heck, I love it in the evening.  \n\nI stumbled upon Sushi Twister while meeting a friends' friend there for lunch.  From the location (trop and boulder) I thought that it would be ahem, ghetto.  Upon walking in you are immediately greeted and the staff is all smiles.  You get seated right on the spot, whether its the sushi bar or a table (we always opt for the table).  \n\nThe menu has some of the most intriguing and delicious rolls I've ever seen, as well as the favorites of any sushi restaurant.  Things like...  Rum Jungle roll?  Sure!  The Mexican roll?  Sure!   Also they are NEVER stuffed with too much rice...you get the amount of fish you pay for!\n\nFor price-wise, they have all you can eat for $27, which I think is a little pricey, but the rolls definitely make up for it.  So why do I only give it 4 stars?  Whenever you get all you can eat, there's usually a rule saying you have to eat everything you order.  The staff seem to be everywhere, looking at every roll that enters your mouth to make sure you do not share it with someone else (like me, who never orders all you can eat sushi since I can only handle 1.5 rolls).  \n\nBut hey, friendly staff, great sushi, drinks always filled, and not as expensive as other sushi restaurants.  Try it :)"

There is no time wasted and the servers are already getting water and asking your beverage order. The ambiance was wonderful good natural light and very nice Asian Decor throughout. I sat at a high top table with my friends but the sushi bar looked very inviting, and all the sushi cooks were nice and well presented. Our server and busser were very prompt both bringing the sushi and clearing empty plates, our glasses were never empty. The owner came over towards the end of our meal and greeted us with a very warm smile and asked about our meal. I cannot praise this sushi restaurant enough from the staff, to the food and ambiance amazing and the very involved owner makes me give this place 5 stars! I appreciate seeing such customer service and integrity in an age where those simple traits are diminishing."

Including Rice, House Salad & Miso Soup\n\nRoyal California $3.57 (half)\nDeep-fried California roll with eel sauce.\n\nCowgirl $5.98 (half)\nAvocado & Cucumber inside, wrapped with slice of Beef Tenderloin.

The resto is fairly small with a sushi bar and tv. Their sushi was pretty good. I particularly liked the Boulder Crunchy and the Cowgirl. My wife had the Salmon Teriyaki Combo which was a lot of food and can easily be shared with 2 people. I wouldn't order the Royal California again bc having a California roll deep fried did not really make it taste better. Overall, this is a good sushi place as they have cheap prices and I like that they have half portion options."

We usually get the Twister's Lunch Special, which gets me and my mom full and for 8 or 9 dollars it's really quite good.\n\nThe last couple of visits, we decided to have the AYCE sushi for lunch. for 23 or 24 dollars a person, it was A-OK. the menu they have here isn't so different from other Sushi places i've been to around Vegas excluding a small number of other special rolls. The quality is great and the taste is pretty good, but in my opinion not the best. Sometimes the rice is falling apart or not aligned correctly and evenly, that when i try to pick it up the rice slides out. Not too good but it doesn't really bother me too much.\n\nThe Service is good. Sometimes i have a feeling the waiter that serves us is in a rush and wants to get our order quickly so he can get on with another task. The Waitresses on the other hand are nice and keep a nice patient attitude which i prefer.\n\nMy mother and I will definitely go back as Sushi Twister is the closest Japanese Restaurant to us!"

They definitely have quality nigiri. The pieces are a nice size and fresh. \n\nOur server was really nice. \n\nBut everything else was just OK. The gyoza was so-so. The seaweed on all of the rolls was very tough and hard to chew which I can't stand. \n\nMy friend even got a crunchy piece of seaweed it was so dry. \n\nThe dessert selection was really limited in comparison to other AYCE places. \n\nI don't know if I'll bother driving 20 minutes back here again."

Their Screaming O is to die for, their Spicy Tuna rolls are delicious, and their Japanese Lasagna is even better! Best place to eat sushi over on our side of town. The service is alright, could be improved a little it but nothing that needs a lot of complaining about. Even though we have visited them more than 50 times, they still ask us if we want the AYCE sushi and if we say yes, they tell us their \"rules\". Yes, Yes, trust me, I know them already.. but hey, they are doing their job.\n\nThe place is small and gets really busy on Fridays and Saturdays but it's cozy and quaint. The decor is good as well. We always sit at the bar because we like the interaction with the Sushi chefs and I like to see them make my sushi (I find it fascinating).\n\nWe will continue to visit Sushi Twister and we recommend them to anyone who says they like sushi."

I actually only had their simple rolls, sashimi, and appetizers the first time I did AYCE here because I didn't bother to flip the menu over! lol\n\nAs a side note - the miso is great and actually somewhat unique. Service is always great and friendly, it's the type where you have your primary server but every server and busser that passes by your table is always happy to help when asked.

I walked in hoping that Sushi Twister can be my new sushi home.\n\nThe plate that I was given had a piece of rice and smears all over. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it but it wasn't a great first impression. The sushi comes out relatively fast, and you can immediately tell why this is a four star venue because they are honest with the rice. In a roll or nigiri there is little rice and plenty of fish.\n\nHowever, a select few of the fish was not fresh. The hamachi was a troubling, dullish hue. I was so disappointed in the hamachi because it's one of my favorites. The shrimp tasted like it had been sitting for a while. I didn't DARE order sea urchin. On a positive note, I think my favorite were the salmon eggs. It wasn't as salty as others I've tried in other venues and it was the most enjoyable, surprisingly!\n\nI would come back because the chef are clearly skilled. I love the rice-to-fish ratio and I know that sushi places can get unlucky with the fish quality sometimes."

            "review": "I was at Sam Boyd stadium last weekend (with Tom C., apparently - go NZ rugby!), and went to this place because of the Yelp rating. I just pulled in, ordered 2 rolls to go, and then left with the rolls. Took about 15-20 mins to get the rolls. They have a pretty extensive selection with a whole menu section for fried/tempura maki (it's not just AYCE). The place was hopping, very busy for mid afternoon. I got an Caterpillar (eel avocado) roll that was good, and something called a Matsuri roll, shrimp tempura with tuna on top. For the take-out, they separated the sauces in little containers, which is a nice thought but it was tricky to eat in the car that way. \"Ecstasy sauce\" (on many of the maki rolls, including Matsuri) is a bit of eel sauce mixed with spicy mayo and some kind of roe. Matsuri roll was good, better than the eel roll.\n\nYou can find the sushi rolls on their Dinner Menu at sushitwister.com, and you can also find out that they use trans fat free tempura oil, \"BEST OIL FOR YOU WHO CARE FOR YOUR HEALTH\"."

The sushi here is from a much better quality and their presentation is very resourceful. Although some people have raved about their all-you-can eat, I recommend their sushi box for two (around $29). You wil get a nice selection of susji, sashimi, teriyaki and tempura. The serving is more than enough for two people. \nSushi twiester also offers live jazz on some nights, but my grave yard shift prevents me from enjoying those."

The atmosphere is upbeat, and the restaurant is clean.\n\nCons:\n1. The chicken & beef teriyaki options are absolutely drowning in teriyaki sauce.  It would be better (and cheaper for the business) if the chef would hold back on the sauce a bit and allow the patron to ask for more sauce if necessary.\n2. The all-you-can-eat (AYCE) option is priced a little high (Lunch ~$23, Dinner ~$27), especially when you consider that the Bellagio buffet is only a couple dollars more.  The lunch price should probably be closer to $17-$19, and the dinner option somewhere around $23-$25 (at most).  \n\nSummary:\nThe AYCE menu has additional rules you need to know, such as a time limit and \"excess food\" charges.  Since these rules can change, I won't waste time writing them all here, but before you order, be aware of these rules.  Also, you may need to adjust your ordering strategy if necessary, such as ordering a lot of food right away because there's a time limit, and since your items are freshly prepared, you don't want to waste time waiting for your food to arrive.  \n\nThis place isn't cheap, but the quality and taste almost match the price.  I'm not convinced that this place is special enough to warrant a far commute, but if you're in the immediate area, I recommend a visit."

Started-off ordering all the nigiri sushi we could think of, since we didn't want to get too full on ordering the rolls (too much rice).  The quality of the fish was good and the service from our sushi chef Takashi was excellent.  Once we felt we got our money's worth, we started ordering the rolls.  Needless to say by the time we left, you could have rolled us out.  Some of my favorites were the white tuna, garlic tuna, unagi, sake and hamachi.  The Cowgirl, Monkey Balls, Screaming For Vengeance and Twisted Scallop were some awesome rolls.  To be honest, everything we ordered was fresh and delicious.  A must try if you're near Boulder Highway and Tropicana."

The salmon was hands down the best, as it melts in your mouth.  They also let you customize the sushi, whether you want cut rolls, hand rolls or something else.  However, their level 5 spicy sushi wasn't very hot & some items are limited to 1 per person (i.e. mochi dessert).\n\nOVERALL:  Great hole in the wall joint I'll def. come back to. I prob shouldn't be telling you about this place since you might end up going here & causing me to have to wait for a table the next time I'm in town.\n\nTIPS:  \nThey have both a lunch buffet (excludes drink; 11am-4pm) & dinner buffet.\n\nI liked the yellow mango with shrimp, spider man"

Enjoyed it to some point but not enough to give them the 4th star maybe 3.5 star \n\nThe good was definitely the nigiris, not a huge selection but the fish used tasted delicious and looked very fresh. The non-rice pieces were a lot larger then the size of the rice which is always great.  I basically worked my way down the list of nigiris they served. Enjoyed most of them with  the tamago and garlic tuna being just a couple of the ones I like. The one thing I didn't like about the nigiris was the rice didn't seem right or at least made to how I usually get them. They kept falling a part and tasted like it was missing something.  The uni and sweet shrimp is only offered on the dinner menu which for $4 more you can upgrade from your lunch price but I wouldn't recommend unless you really want them, what I was told, the only difference is one order of uni and sweet shrimp.\n\nThe Salmon Skin handroll wasn't that bad, two bites and it was gone. They had something called the Monkey Balls and I had to try it.  It was meh didn't care for them. It was something bitesized and fried but runny and taste so good .  I poured some of the liquids or sauce out after the 1st bite. The fried tofu is served hot so let it cool down and poke salad was a bunch of seaweed and little fish both were alright. The salmon and tuna kamas were both burnt, dry, and overcooked. The green mussles were also burnt and overcooked. The shrimp tempura were standard, ended up getting maybe 5 orders just cause I love shrimp tempura. I didn't see any oysters which are another item I love getting at sushi spots. I sampled some of the rolls not bad. I need to try more they had your usual regular, fried, and baked rolls. \n\nIts a small place and it got busy on Saturday between lunch and dinner. The service started great and got my first orders quickly but after that there was almost 10+ min gap between me finishing my plates and them checking on me. I even got the bill early as I was still a little hungry.\n\nWould I go back? Yes, it's still a pretty solid sushi spot for the area."

            "review": "Sushi Twister is one of the most conveniently located sushi restaurants for people on the East side of town.  I go here for lunch or dinner at least once or twice a week.  Their menu has a great deal of variety.  There are even plenty of things to eat for friends who don't do \"raw fish.\"  The staff is very friendly.  They even know exactly what I will order, and always greet me with a smile.  The all you can eat is $20.95 for lunch, and $25.95 for dinner. Like other places in town, they have a stamp card.  I often get sushi to go as well, and the presentation is very nice on to-go orders too.  I definitely recommend this place for anyone on the East side of town."
