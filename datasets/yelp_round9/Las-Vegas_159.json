It came with honey, jam, bread, etc.  It was a great starter for sharing!  Instead of picking the cheeses, we asked the server to do so, and he did an excellent job.  Loved the Brigante cheese the best!\n\nI split the Pepperoni Pizza and the Spaghetti & Meatballs.  Both were pretty excellent.  My friend slightly liked the spaghetti better, and I slightly liked the pizza better.  The pasta wasn't a huge portion, but it just right.\n\nGlad we tried it."

            "review": "I give it 4 stars in consideration of some nostalgic value (to me). My wife and I have come here each time we stop in Vegas for a number of years. The pizzas are good, creative, and with high quality ingredients. The setup with the round bar in the middle, soft lighting, with location in the St. Mark's square recreation, is welcoming. The lighting with displays of aged meats make me think of some trattorias I have been in Emiglia Romagna. The food is on the pricier side compared to national averages but not awful relative to standard prices nearby on the strip. The service seems to have fallen in quality. The bathroom last time was a little bit on the side of disgusting. The place was less crowded. All make me fear the place will not be here forever (the puck restaurant on the other side of the square closed over the past year)."

I went with a group of coworkers for cocktails and appetizers at 2:30 in the afternoon the restaurant was half empty, I realize this is Vegas and whatnot but I felt the service was rude:\n\nHostess \" Drinks and appetizers... well... we normally reserve these table for people who are eating, but since we're slow we can accommodate you, we may have to ask for the table back though...\"\nUs: \"OK, that's fine\"\n\nI never realized appetizers weren't food.... What if we ordered a $500 bottle of wine? Would they let us take up space then?\n\nWaiter after taking 20 minutes to talk to us: \"No food, we may have to ask you to leave since we save these tables for people who are eating:\nUs \"Yes, we already told the hostess, and she sat us anyway!\"\n\nIt took 20 more minutes for 2 beers and 3 glasses of wine to be delivered, and by that time we had to leave, needless to say the waiter did not get a gratuity from us.  First time I've ever done that!\n\nWe felt unwelcome and the waiter never offered us appetizers or anything else, he was condescending to the people who ordered a beer and asked for a beer list..\n\n\"Enoteca means wine bar, so we only have one beer to choose from.\"\n\nMeanwhile the bar is fully stocked with every type of vodka you could ever want.\n\nI wanted to like the place and possibly go back for dinner, but after this I would never go back, there are plenty of other places to spend your money in Vegas!"

From the Moscato to the olives to the arugla salad and my pasta all the way to the coffee and tiramisu, it was divine.  I can't eat for days I'm so full and content!  Everything was seasoned and prepared perfectly.  I felt like the chefs were in the kitchen waiting for my next order.  The tiramisu and coffee are a must.  The staff were very prompt and professional.  You will not run out of refreshments, nor will a finished dish sit ungathered for long.  Bravo!"

The service was pretty deficient even when the restaurant was extremely busy.\n\nThe food left little to be desired. The dishes are all insanely salty. I totally understand how tragic an under-salted or under-seasoned meal is, but I couldn't taste anything but salt in both the pasta dishes and the pizza that we ordered. \n\nThere are so many great in dining options in the Venetian/Palazzo compound, this just isn't one of them. I definitely won't be returning."

The wild mushroom bruschetta was one of the worst things I've been served in Las Vegas; the bread was charred, the mushrooms were cold and slimy (it was disgusting). \n \n The service was pretty mediocre too; the server asked if we liked the bruschetta and we told him no. He was in complete disbelief and sort of put us on the defensive when he said \"i mean... I can see what I can do about it\". We told him we weren't going to worry about it, but we explained that we weren't going to lie about finding it disgusting and we thought they should know. It was pretty much the last time we saw him until the bill was dropped (and no; he didn't do anything about the bruschetta)."

            "review": "To be honest, this was our last choice for food, but it ended up being a pretty solid choice. Our bachelor party of 12 dudes needed a casual spot to get food without spending too much (in the realm of Strip restaurants), and without traveling too far. Otto Enoteca fulfilled all of those needs quite well. Located by the shops in the Venetian, the space is surprisingly small for how big it looks from the outside, but we were able to get seated right away without a reservation, and drinks/water were distributed very quickly.\n\nWe all split some arancini (fried rice balls), which were quite excellent, so much so, that we ended up getting more orders of it to start off. As for my entree, I got the carbonara pizza, which had egg, scallion and guanciale on top, and was quite excellent. I assumed that the egg would just be a runny yolk on top, but it was actually scrambled on top, which turned out really well. The scallion had just enough bite to cut through the richness of the pizza, and I finished the pizza off quite quickly, almost wanting some more. \n\nService was pretty helpful and attentive, as much as can be in the late afternoon for a group of 12 hungry dudes. Prices were pretty much on par for a casual sit-down for the Strip, with pizzas around $20, and cocktails/wine were about $11-12.\n\nGiven the names behind this place (Batali and Bastianich), it's a pretty decent place for Italian if you're staying in the Venetian, but perhaps nothing to go out of your way for. Yet, if you need flexibility and have a large party for lunch or a casual dinner, Otto Enoteca will do quite nicely."

            "review": "Over the years, Otto Pizzeria at the Venetian Piazza San Marco has been one of my favorite lunch places to hit while in Vegas.\n\nIt's in a big wide open area with high ceilings painted to look like the sky so it really gives you a feeling of being at the real Piazza San Marco - actually better since its AC, not in the direct sun, no mega crowds and clean :)\n\nThat being said I really used to love the bruschetta there.  The standard bruschetta, not the daily \"special of the day\" bruschetta they serve now.  That and maybe either the bread changed or I'm a little pickier about the bread or dough.  \n\nThe pic is attached but the garlic, honey, prosciutto looks and tastes like ham on a big jelly baguette.  Not what I was expecting and disappointing. \n\nSo I usually have some kind of pizza and really felt like a meat lovers so requested a salami and prosciutto combo.  I was warned (and should have listened) that the salami is aged and has a strong, gamey taste to it.  Wasn't a good choice but my bad.  The second thing that was disappointing was that the pizza wasn't hot or fresh.  Tasted almost like it was reheated - and not reheated enough.  Really disappointing as you can totally tell when you're eating old leftover pizza...\n\nThat was two disappointments for the food.  I still love the atmosphere and the service - the busser, waiter and host were all tremendous with excellent service.  They just don't reheat or cook the food.\n\nOverall, if you're at the Venetian, you've gotta eat is the Piazza San Marco... But you might want to try someplace else."

However, my Bf had a change of heart last minute and we wanted to try it out for ourselves and I am sure glad we did. We ordered their Insalata di Mare which was divine. I cannot express myself enough if you are a seafood lover how tasty this salad is and is a must try. Being a cheese fanatic since birth I ordered their Quattro Formaggi Pizza. I really must rave about this pizza for cheese lovers. The presentation of this pizza was very clever and it was delicious. I don't want to ruin the surprise for first timers but you won't be disappointed. \n\nWe arrived during happy hour so we took advantage of their beer and drink specials. Their house made Gelato is also a must try. If you are looking for a yummy spot for Pizza, Drinks and a wonderful ambiance at the Venetian. Look no further. Come to Otto."

Like other low rating reviewers I join in with the same complaint.\nA restaurant obviously existing due to celebrity association, food is mediocre in quality, service is ok and the wine list is acceptable though.\nThat is not enough.\nI went to B&B tonight hesitantly because it was serving later than anywhere else. It was so amazing so I had to write up how bad Otto was.... And under the same chef names.\nJoe B.... Really? Otto needs a major overhaul.\nSticky tables, pepperoni pizza none of the four kids at the table would touch ( and then the grown ups too). Not even a question from the waiter as for why a pizza is not touched in a table of eight. The meatballs are bland, the chicken tastes like a Greek souvlaki, the mushroom appetizer bland as well.\n\nVery disappointed."

Meat and cheese dishes were good, but nothing you couldn't easily surpass at your local Italian market (if you live near one).\n\nAnd the biggest let down was the pizza.  I've had a lot of similar pizzas: brick oven, flat bread, thin crust, etc.. and this ranks below par.  And for the price it is ridiculous.  It was mediocre at best with a premium price tag."

            "review": "Context:\nThis  was the last thing we did on our way out of town after a chaotic weekend visiting family in from the east coast. I don't gamble and I am not a fan of Vegas culture, but I had hoped this meal would be a deperature from the slick and tacky and over the top.  I was looking forward to an authentic, quiet meal in a kitchy, yet relaxing (by vegas standards) environment. \n\nFirst Ominous Impressions:\n\nThe whole meal started off badly. We waited nearly twenty minutes for our order to be taken, even though the restaurant was half empty.  The music was grating and loud (this, coming from someone whose boyfriend has a gold album from his punk band) and it clashed horribly with the music coming from Saint Mark's square. When I come to an Italian place, I really do want Italian music, either Italian classical or opera or Italian modern or vinatge pop, or hell, Sinatra in a pinch, but not whatever that awful American meathead stuff was that was blaring from the speakers.\n\nThe Meal, the goodish bits:  \n\n Once we were seated, the staff were kind and attentive, and my Venetian Spritzer was refreshing and balanced. The fried squash blossom was pretty good, and reminded me of the ones my great grandmother used to make, but the rice flour batter got too chewy very quickly and the frying oil tasted old. \n\nThe Meal, the horror show: \n\nThe vegetable plates came out discolored and overcooked and yet, ice cold (should have been room temp) and soggy with oil. My boyfriend nearly broke a tooth on a stone in the farro (but refused to complain, because he is exceedingly polite). But the worst were the pastas! They were so salty that it was actually painful to eat them. Even my boyfriend agreed to tell the truth when the server came by to ask about our meals.  We were told our pasta was salty because the pasta water is salted. Um...I salt my pasta water at home, with a generous handful of salt, and I love salt so very much, but this tasted like a full tablespoon in the finish of a single, small (23 dollar) portion. Even after we got our pastas back, they were still like a salt lick. I'm not entirely convinced they did anything different at all, and with a fairly spendy price tag, I'd hoped for something actually edible.\n\nOverall Experience: \n\nThis meal was a disgrace, made even more crushing because I adore Mario Batali's show and personality (and, swoon, that red beard!). I had such high hopes, but my dear Italian grandmothers are spitting in their graves. \n\nMario, do you read these reviews? Do you understand that this experience was supposed to be a high note for us? A redemption? The sole tasteful experience of a weekend in hell, I mean, Las Vegas? Meals create memories...and this memory is \ntarnished."

It's far from \"fine dinging\" but maybe a step above casual as well.  The bread was good and so was the service.  But with the food it seems like they were just not trying too hard.  The food has always been good, but not too amazing, just decent.  A lot of it looking like it came out of a can and was Microwaved.  Mario Batali's name is plastered over the place, but  it seems like many of the Vegas restaurants in Vegas where the famous chef might have came up with the fancy sounding names on the menu, cashes his check and disappeared.  Plus, they are very pushy on the wine, which looks to be where the money is.  Don't order wine, don't expect to see your waiter much\n\nSome of the other reviews kinda hint at fake Italian for tourists, but it's Vegas, is is pretty much all \"Fake ____ for tourists.\"  This is clearly that, though.  It's not great, it's just not good and far from authentic or exciting.  I suppose it is still good food and a decent atmosphere, but you can do better, especially in Vegas."

I tend to avoid Italian places when outside of the northeast due to them not usually being as good as the food in places like Federal Hill in Providence and usually being twice the price. Otto proved me wrong.\n\nI started with a selection of two cheeses, taleggio and fontina. My girlfriend ordered the roasted tomato and cucumber panzanella.\n\nI think about that cheese like fourteen year old girls think about Justin Beiber. It was one of the best things I have ever had. I enjoyed it with the table bread and it was served with some type of blueberry, another type of preserved apricots and some incredibly good, fancy honey which appeared to have truffle in it. I'm not 100% sure what was in the accompaniments but it was all fantastic. Creamy cheese with the honey on crusty bread mmmmmhhmmm. I knew right when I was eating it that I would miss that plate until the next time I visit. Cant stress enough how much I liked this.\n\nMy girlfriend said the same about the panzanella. I took a bite and agreed. It wasnt something either of us would normally order but it all came together so perfectly. I'm not one to take a bite of plain tomato but I would eat mountains of this. \n\nMy entree was the Rigatoni with Ragu Napolitana. Big perfectly al dente rigatoni noodles with a veal ragu that was pretty much just stunning. It got better with every bite. At first I wasnt that impressed. Then I kept tasting it and noticed how perfectly and simply flavored everything was. Just another incredible dish..\n\nMy girlfriend had the Bucatini. I'll just say she thought everything of her pasta that I did mine. \n\nThe service was fine. Attentive but not overbearing. nothing incredible but certainly passable. No complaints.\n\nI never really liked Batali much on tv but after eating his food I feel a little differently."

The decor is warm and home-y and it has a live show with a band that plays classical music every hour. The ceilings are around 80 feet and they're beautifully painted and they resemble clouds so it feels as if you're outside!\nThe food and service are both spectacular! \nI have tried the braised pork shoulder and it was so tender and flavorful and the cucumber salad on top was great!\nI also had the rigatoni pasta with veal and it was so rich and hearty. The veal was cooked to perfection and it was very savory!\nI also tried the caprese salad which was to die for. It was during a time that they had cherry tomatoes in season and I liked the sweetness of it. The deserts they had to offer were also so amazing! They had pistachio and olive oil gelato and it was so creamy and amazing! \nThe service was great! Everyone on staff from the managers to the servers and even the hosts were all so kind and warm! \nI love this place and want to continue coming back for as long as possible!"

We originally happened upon this restaurant when we were window shopping at the Grand Canal Shops in the Venetian.  It has now become a must each visit.  Everything on the menu is great, but they offer a specialty pizza that is out of this world.  I am not even a real pizza fan, but this one is one I dream about!  It is a CORN PIZZA.  Yup, corn.  If you are looking to taste something different and amazing, please try it.  It is a white pie with a creamy corn spread, mozzarella, cherry tomato slices, scallions, and a hint of red pepper.  The only reason I am not ranking this establishment with 5 stars is due to the lackadaisical nature of some of the staff, particularly the hostess.  However, that would never stop me from returning."

For a couple of pieces if it wasn't centered on the mozzarella your slice was just tomato sauce and nothing else. Very unimpressed and very expensive. Had eaten at Wolfgang Puck's the day before across the walkway and would give that 5 stars."

The service was spot-on and the food was awesome.... so much so that I ate there twice during my week long stay.\nHave some cheese - I highly recommend the taleggio. It is fantastic by itself and even better with the honey, cherry, or apricot they bring out with the cheese. I got the cheese both times it was just so good.\nThe fried cauliflower was hands down the best fried cauliflower I've ever eaten.  It didn't need any dipping sauce, just a little lemon juice that's it.\nThey make their own ricotta in house and you can tell. \nWe got great wine recommendations from our waiter. \nOf the 4 main courses I've seen/eaten not one was disappointing. The spaghetti and meatballs was simple and tasty. The veal meatballs on polenta I will definitely have to have next time I go."

Go!\n\nTease:  Iron Chef, Mario Batali's small Italian Pizzeria and caf\u00e9 in the Venetian casino. \n\nWhy I went:  We were in the mood for a nice lunch before flying home and this seemed as good as any to try.  We love his place Mozza in LA, so why not give it a whirl?\n\nWhen: 11/20/12, we went for lunch early.  It looks like it could get crowded.  It wasn't when we went.\n\nFood:  For drinks, I had a really solid spicy Bloody Mary ($14), and my wife had a tasty glass of Lambrusco ($12).  We enjoyed an app of olives, and 1 cheese that were exceptional!  The olives were good, but the cheese was amazing!  Sadly, I can't recall the exact one...but it was a harder Italian cheese served with the most ridiculously tasty truffle honey we've ever had!  We over-ordered so that we could take some food home with us...  We had a pepperoni pizza.  Very good...but not Mozza good!  Nancy Silverton's influence on the crust in Mozza is apparent when comparing it to Otto.  There just is no comparison!  However, the pork shoulder and the buccatini Amatriciana were SUPER good!  The pork shoulder at $26 isn't inexpensive, but it's worth every penny!  It's Mario's signature dish and is packed with flavor.  Also, the pasta was simply perfectly prepared.  It had some nice spice and was so good...I overate and finished it!  The pasta was $19 as was the pizza.  All reasonable given the quality.  \n\nService:  Good.  Cruz T. did a fine job serving us.\n\nHints/Final thoughts:  Get the cheeses, apps, pastas...and pork shoulder!  Save the pizza for elsewhere.  It's good, and if you are craving it, it does the trick.  But if you've been to Mozza...don't expect similar."

We had a great table facing the entertainment in the \"square.\" Our waiter was really friendly and walked us through his recommendations for the menu.

The pizza was really good - tons of fresh prosciutto and the crust was done just right. The carbonara pasta was pretty heavy and had an odd but good taste if that makes sense. I think a really stinky cheese was used. I don't know if I would have liked it as just a single entr\u00e9e because it was so rich but it was a great combo with the pizza.

I detest celery, but how on earth do you blend octopus, potato, and celery to make the best salad ever? I would go back to eat this. The small portion is plenty for two people.\n\nI got the calamari pasta with squid ink pasta and a pesto. It was super salty and heavy-handed as can be with the garlic. You couldn't really taste anything besides the garlic. In theory it sounded delicious on the menu, but I wouldn't recommend it. It was really oily, and the pasta was more raw than al dente.\n\nService is hit-or-miss. When the crowd was thinner, service was spot on and great. When things got busy, I ended up waiting on my check way after the folks at the table next to us cleared out, even though they got there after me. Very few times do I find myself getting irate with how long I have to wait for my check, but this was one of those instances.\n\nNot sure if I would recommend going back again.

The following were ordered and I sampled each:\nRomana Pizza (anchovy pizza)\nLasagna\nRavioli\n\nAll three were mediocre and something you would find at a buffet at Vegas.  That would be fine if I was visiting a buffet, but I tend to avoid the petri dishes that we consider buffets as much as possible.  So...if you go to a restaurant, you expect decent food for the price you pay.  You don't expect overpriced beef a roni.\n\nWe all paid relatively high for raviolis that were not filled with anything (not sure if the chef screwed up or the filling was cooked out in the sauce), lasagna that I could cook better using a Batali recipe, and my Romana pizza that obviously had old anchovies.  The anchovies tasted like sardines that had been sitting out for a few days and were sometimes licked by a cat.  Super fishy..more than a normal anchovy.  The sauce on the pizza had the taste of a canned sauce, and the cheese was flavorless.  The capers were the only thing decent on the pizza.  \n\nI asked the waitress about the anchovies, and she just said \"yes...that is how anchovy tastes.\"  No...that is not how they taste when they are new.  I have eaten at 5 star restaurants and the anchovies were fresh.  What they gave me was horrible.\n\nBatali has cookbooks all over the place in that restaurant and I noticed we were right next to the Venetian streetscene play...so I put two and two together.  This must be his throw away restaurant (place where he sends his older food) and he believes the touristy area of the place will suffice for driving traffic.\n\nAlso, the service was sub par for a supposedly higher scale restaurant.  It took them some time to seat us (although there were a lot of tables) mainly because nobody was at the station for about 10 minutes.  This didn't just happen with us.  Other patrons were standing in a line with about 7 tables open because the hostess was nowhere to be found.  Bad experience, but it is a learning experience.  Apparently a top chef's restaurant can suck, and this one sucks.  I also learned that if push comes to shove that I can live off of cat food.  That will help in the zombie apocalypse."

The service was very good and we were seated quickly with prompt service\nHowever, I would attribute that to perhaps that we were eating dinner early for Vegas standards and was not very full.\n\nAlthough I have never been to Italy, my wife has and assured me the food was very authentic. She had the pancetta and goat cheese pizza and I had the Napoliante or pasta with veal in sauce. Both were excellent. I also recognized that Mario Batteli is one of the owners, which is not a reason to rate a food both very interesting."

The waiter came and brought me my iced tea quickly.  He recommended the spaghetti and meatballs to me, which I ordered. Even though the restaurant was not busy, it did take quite a while for the food to arrive, however it was probably the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had.  The sauce was on the spicy side, which I like and the meatballs were pretty much bite size.  \n\nI did not order desert and since this was lunch, I cannot speak to the wine menu but would recommend it for lunch if you have the time."

We had ZERO complaints, and that's unusual. \n\nWe gave the wine guy a price range for a wine and a general idea of what we like, and he picked out a wonderful Zin. We loved it. Our waiter was awesome. I wish we got his name--Asian guy. He explained the menu to us in detail and gave us great recommendations. What I like about this place is that you can get cheeses and appetizers that are relatively inexpensive and will fill you up.\n\nWe started with:\n-Ricotta fritters: 6 balls of cheese, rolled in bread crumbs and fried in peanut oil. TO DIE FOR\n-Lentils \"alla Toscana\": really tasty if you're a lentils fan\n-Panteleo cheese: A goat cheese--delicious\n-Taleggio cheese: A cow's milk cheese--also delicious\n\nLike I said, these were all really reasonably priced and we were pretty full with them. Not full enough to skip an entree, of course. Who do you think we are?!\n\nWe decided to split the eggplant pizza. The dough was perfect--soft, but crisp. I worry about eggplant (and other veggies) making the dough soggy, but this didn't have that issue at all.\n\nFor dessert, we got the Otto Sundae. If you don't splurge on this, at least get the gelato by itself. It's housemade and SO GOOD."

I liked that the pesto was a really light walnut, celery pesto, so it wasn't overly creamy and filling. I normally absolutely love sunchokes, but these were just chunks of roasted sunchokes. They were also a bit too tough to go with the pasta. I would have liked them to be roasted a bit more, to the point where they're really creamy and almost \"melty\". I though that would have complimented the pasta in terms of texture a bit better. It was odd to have to stop, cut the sunchoke (with some difficulty), and then continue eating. Roast it a bit longer, and then it will probably just seamlessly meld in with the rest of the dish - and be a bit easier to cut through!"

The wine and cheese. They offer a really nice five dollar antipasto platter that features charcuterie, olives and some cheeses. The menu also offers cheese options that can be ordered singly or in tastings of 2-5 different types. The water buffalo mozzarella continues to be a can't miss item but the Fontina and others are great too.Nice homemade bread accompanies all orders  ....Ahh the wine ... This time we started with a wonderful Proseca and followed it with a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc. We  topped the adventure off with a beautiful Pinot Noir that dripped fruitiness and depth.

We requested to be seated in the piazza area, but were told it was full, but would try to get a table out there. well, after 10 minutes, we were told it couldn't be done. Big surprise. We then were escorted to the back dining room area . Nice room with wine bottle decor and a very smart elegant atmosphere. Loved the taste of the room. That was great, Mario. \n\nI don't know how to tell you this, Mario, but I'll try stating my overall experience with all the respect and admiration I have for you. \n\nWe ordered the penne dishes and the Taliatelli dish for my daughter and had the cheese appetizers.  Pasta was prepared adequately and tasted great. No problem, except portions were extremely small compared to the other Italian restaurants we've visited in LV.  So small in fact that we all stopped at another restaurant within an hour because we were all hungry still.  Unheard of from an Italian restaurant where the food at the table is abundant.  Ok, so you have ambiance.  \n\nOther issues.\n\nWhen we were seated in the dining room, there was already a full table of 6 people having dinner and were sometimes too loud for the room.  No biggie.\n\nThen after a half hour or so, servers were scrambling to put 4-5 tables together for about 20 people who had shown up.  In this small room? Are you kidding? Since this room was small these people were very loud and disturbing to everyone.  So much so, I couldn't hear the server explaining the desserts on the menu.  It was so disturbing, we chose to leave the second we were finished with the entree. \n\nWe were sorry we didn't do 'Trattoria Reggiano' on the way in.  The food looked out of this world and everyone seemed to be having a great time.\n\nIn short, nice place, but needs some work on the portions, selections and stuffing about 40 noisy people into a small room.  Server should have moved us out before.  And Mario, no Gnocchi or Cavatelli or Lasagna on the menu?? Whaa??\n\nVery disappointed with our initial visit and will probably not visit your restaurants.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nSincerely, Sal Carone"

We ordered the olives, the beets, the eggplant, the parsnips and pickles. Super delicious!!! We ordered the fried mozzarella spedini and sweet potato croquette. They told me both were tasty. My family really enjoyed the pizza and said best pizza ever. I did not try the pizza nor the pasta due to my wheat belly challenge. They told me the crust is thin and crispy. Usually due to the sauce, thin crust pizza gets soggy but this pizza bottom was crispy throughout. The broccoli rabe pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I did not have the pasta but did try some sausage and the broccoli rabe and that tasted amazing. \n\nWe did not have room for dessert but left with a happy belly.

We ordered 5 dishes and shared family style.  \n\nBraised pork shoulder - the The first one we received was fatty and overcooked.  We ended up sending it back to the kitchen. The second time they served it to us was definitely a better cut of meat was a proper temperature, but really lacked overall taste.\n\nCarbonara Pizza - this was simply OK. Didn't wow us and really wasn't that hot. I have had much better pizzas even at California pizza kitchen.\n\nBlack Ink Pasta - temperature was good on this one it tasted OK. It really lacked flavor.\n\nVeal Meatballs on Palenta - this was a good helping size. The temperature was very good on these. But again lacked overall taste. I wasn't impressed.\n\nCarrot Side Dish - oddly enough, this was my most favorite part of the entire meal and it's a side dish!. They were perfectly cooked tasted absolutely fantastic and I could've made a meal of them all alone by themselves.\n\nTo wrap it up, the service was excellent but the kitchen just didn't deliver the food. I've had way better meals for $120 tab than I had last night. It was just OK. \n\nPut this place last on your list. Of all the fine dining locations In Las Vegas don't make this one of them."

Another server finally spotted us as we were preparing to leave and came over to say our waiter was a bit overwhelmed and she would take our order.  Since we were eating mid-afternoon there weren't many patrons around, so I don't know what overwhelmed the waiter.  Anyway, when the food finally came we still hadn't seen our drinks.  The food was memorable for how forgettable it was except for the pepperoni pizza which had an off taste.  So the overwhelmed waiter finally returned to us magically refreshed and very upbeat.  I can't imagine how such a change occurred so suddenly.  So upbeat, in fact, that he mistakenly charged me for an extra glass of wine and when I brought this to his attention he slapped his forehead and exclaimed that he had indeed caught that and had prepared a new bill but had forgotten to print it and present it to us.  No, don't worry, these things happen (when you're trying to scam your customers).  $115 for 2 for lunch.  Is that really normal?  To think we were sent there by an enthusiastic concierge from the Palazzo.  I know great food and I know great service and this place has neither."

After being completely blown away by the service and food at the other Batali restaurants we have patron-ed I was looking forward to a great lunch date on my recent spur of the moment Vegas trip. Although I was happy overall with my meal, I was not like BLOWN away with it nor was I extremely impressed with the service. I cannot put my finger on it exactly but our server, although pleasant was the not caliber of server I expect for this price point. A fifty dollar lunch is a fifty dollar lunch and my server should not have tacky black and white stars chipping nail polish, a wrinkled shirt, and not be extremely knowledgeable about the menu. The food came out at a good pace, we have the fried saffron rice balls, which were nice, the meats plate with some salami, and then split a pizza. The best thing about this place was the pizza crust. So thin and crisp I think it was a deciding factor in us picking up a new pizza stone at Williams and Sonoma on the drive home.  In closing, a perfectly adequate meal but for the price I was expecting to be wow'd a little more and definitely to have a more professional waitstaff."

Weird.\n\nWe also shared some Verdure: Olives (plentiful dish of olives), Lentils Alla Toscana (always solid), and Eggplant Caponata (decent).  Our server had to use a rolodex looking device to explain the Caponata to us. She better have been new; she was slow, inattentive, and not too bright.\n\nWe shared a pasta and a pizza.  Both bleh! We had the Rigatoni with Pork Belly and Swiss Chard, and cheese.  How is it possible that this dish has no flavor whatsoever?!?!  One of the most boring dishes ever. What a waste!  We also shared the Sausage and Peppers pizza.  Terrible.  It says Pizzeria in the name!  Sausage was bland, pizza was apparently salt free, and the sauce was flavorless.

The highlight of the meal was getting out of the terribly uncomfortable chairs as we left.\n\nWe had reservations through the hotel concierge but still had to wait for our table. When we were seated, we made the apparently unforgivable decision not to order alcohol and were promptly ignored by the waitstaff. It's been a long time since I've had such a grumpy waiter.  \n\nImagine my surprise when the waiter dropped off a plastic package of \"cracker-like\" breadsticks. At the time I was surprised, but more was to come. We ordered a set of appetizers, a pizza, and a salad for the two of us, earning an impressive sigh and eye roll from the waiter who returned with a small plate of actual bread (from costco I think) with some oil and vinegar.\n\nNow, most Italian places take pride in their olive oil and vinegar, and with the chef Mario connection my expectations were high. But this oil might as well have been canola, and the vinegar was merely caramel colored and bland.\n\nAfter my water glass had been dry for about ten minutes someone showed up and dropped our appetizers on the table. The mozzarella was burned and the squash blossom was a grease bomb going off in my mouth. Both lacked any real flavor.  The caprese salad was a decent preparation, but the tomatoes were not very flavorful and the pesto had an unfortunate amount of mint.\n\nThe pizza arrived after another ten minutes. And was the wrong pizza. The girl who brought it offered to let us keep it, but was going to add it to our bill if we did. We really wanted the pizza we ordered, and when we said so she took the other pizza away in a huff.\n\n20 minutes later, our ordered truffle pizza arrived. It looked pretty good, smelled good, and we were excited that this might be turning around finally. Alas, I could barely get down one bite. My wife managed two. The pizza was bitter, the truffles were burned and flavorless, and the whole thing was drenched in the same flavorless oil that they served with the bread. \n\nThe high point of the meal turned out to be the prepackaged cracker sticks that arrived first. If course, the waiter wouldn't do anything about our 9/10ths uneaten meal, so for $70 we got to come back to our hotel room and snack from the minibar. Yuck."

It also reminds me of past travels abroad. \n\nSimulated outdoor dining ha! Your view is a pretty good replica of St. Mark's square in Venice, ahem... minus the Cathedral, sexy Italian guys, and pigeon poop LOL! \n\nI like to eat earlier rather than later in the evening (better for your health) so I did not have to wait for a table at 5:30PM. Before I talk about what I ate I have to share that while waiting for my libation; I saw that there was a crowd gathering and I noticed that they were mesmerized by a damn Mime that was supposed to look like an ancient, white, venetian statue. The Venetian Hotel was playing along, with strategic lighting and a platform for her to stand on. Of course she only moved when a tourist gave her some money - and then they took pics standing next to the sham. I totally detest that kind of shiz but did not let it upset my appetite and just laughed at how funny people are *rolling eyes* \n\nMMMMmmmmmmm okay here were go: \n\nI actually chose starters again but all were so delicious and are ranked by delectability below: \n\nFried Risotto Balls = OMG! I forgot the actual menu name, but I think you get like 4 of them for $9. Imagine if you will; warm, cheesy risotto rolled into a ball and flash fried to a crunchy golden brown. Non greasy goodness and they were gone within a blink. \n\nProsciutto di Parma = Dry cured ham that melts in your mouth. This is not your down stream prosciutto but actually imported from a little but well know town of Parma. To learn more about why I had to try this specialty: http://www.italyinsf.com/2008/10/21/prosciutto-di-parma/ \n\nRoasted Beets with Saba = Even if you are not a beet fan, this is a pleasing, light and healthy balance to the fried risotto balls. I was happy to see their choice of yellow and orange beets instead of the same ol boring red. The roasted flavor is immediate and the Saba, which is a cooked grape juice really made it pop, another good choice. \n\nI'm actually going back to the Venetian in a few days and will plan on trying their squash blossoms, grilled radicchio w/ smoked mozzarella and braised pork shoulder. Stay tuned!"

With all the choices in Las Vegas, and having experienced a nice variety of them during our stay, we were looking forward to a simple spaghetti and meatballs dinner with some Mario creativity to flavor. \n\nReally cool spot, Mario. The atmosphere was nice and we enjoyed the piazza setting. Great lighting, nice \"show\", simple elegance- all worth a little extra, in my book. We've paid a lot more for a lot less ambiance in this town. Hostess seated us with a very big smile and I liked that. So thanks for all that, Mario.\n\nI don't know how to tell you this, Mario, but there's some disconnect from there- so I'll try. We've experienced the best and worst of dining throughout Italy and we get the Fritti, Insalate, Piatti dining experience, and we do appreciate it. But, we're in Vegas where it's always not so transparent how authentic dining in Vegas can be. So, spaghetti and meatballs for $20 might need some clarification in this stippling of cultures. I sometimes defer to a quote I was once offered in another country when I asked directions of another US citizen- \"We're from America, we don't know s***.\" Most of those walking up to view your menu might not know s*** about requiring multiples of $20 dishes to be able to rub their substantial bellies on the way out.\n\nShame on us, we fell for the $20 pasta dish. Oh, it was authentic. That is, relatively minimal, delicious, perfectly cooked and lovely. I might add my disappointment with your arrogant and negligent server. He made it clear that his interests were elsewhere in the room. In addition, my son's request for Gnocchi with meat sauce was accepted with \"I don't know, but I'll ask\", and dismissed with \"We can't do that\"- what??? So he ordered spaghetti with your little Irish hamburger marbles that you call meatballs (of which we each ate one of the ten or so little impostors), and very soon after, we're completing our dishes. Also, nice job at the math blackboard during staff training. Two persons, two pieces of bread- four persons, four pieces of bread. (Reminder- America/Vegas).\n\nMario, if I were anywhere but the middle of a \"mall\" in Las Vegas, I might have added some consideration for the menu authenticity. Get your best marketing people and figure out a way to clarify to your walk-ups that the $20 pasta is a side dish or offer the Walmart Shopper option for a couple dollars more. And let the people have what they want if it's Gnocchi with meat sauce. Also, please try to update your online menu info, it isn't even close to real time. \n\nNow that I know, I have a special little spot where I can get an authentically prepared snack between shopping and dinner for less than room service. Again, thanks for that. \n\nSincerely, Vegas visitor."

And to boot, even though the food is top notch, there is no need to dress up! :)  The only reason I'm giving it a 4 vs. a 5 is that is is a bit pricey, but I suppose that's to be expected in Vegas in general. Def recommend it though!"

It's located in the Venetian Hotel, known for its \"Venice\" theme with gondolas, water way, quaint shops and 65 ft ceiling painted to look like the sky. Sitting in tthe middle of an indoor town square, which is where this restaurant is located, you really do feel like you are outdoors at sunset. \n\nThis is \"no quick bite before heading back to the hotel\" place, at least you shouldn't let it. I don't mean the service is slow, it's quite the opposite. Allow yourself enough time to savor fine wine and food. \n\nI couldn't resist but ordered cheese and wine, Italian-made, of course.   The  Lucerne Chardonnay ($17 a glass) and it's light, smooth, refreshing.  I then ordered a cheese plate with fresh Ricotta -- smooth, light, and buttery, not too salty. This cheese is made at the restaurant.\n\nI finished with a Whole Wheat Pasta with proscuitto. The one thing I admired about Mario's pasta is that the al dente is cooked to be slightly crunchy but also soft at the same time. I could never repeat this texture at home.  \n\nYou can't go wrong with any Mario restaurant, and this one is no exception."

You do have the option of by the glass, and the ounces vary from 4-8 oz. We let our server pick our pizza for us, he suggested the Sweet Onion, (proscuitto cotto, bel paese) the crust was pleasant, like a typical version of thin, crisp Neapolitan-style, but the way the prosciutto was placed really threw me off, it was literally slices like what you would put on a sandwich, placed all over the pizza. The pizza was really lacking in flavor as well. We also split an arugula salad, which was also a miss. I don't see myself visiting this restaurant again, as there are way better pizza places in town, and many more Italian options."

From the service, to the food, to the ambiance (minus the tables with kids), it was all perfection.  \n\nFirstly, we loved our server.  He was so patient and offered us a reasonably priced wine after we described they type of wine we like.  He offered wonderful suggestions and didn't push us to order too much, or too little.  \n\nWe stared with several appetizers:  ricotta fritters, which were incredible, lentils, way better than I expected them to be...(I wish they sold those at Trader Joe's), and two cheeses which were accompanied by jam and honey to compliment them.  We had a goat cheese and a cow's milk cheese.  \n\nBy the time we had gotten through the appetizers we were too full to each get a main course.  We were in the mood for pizza and split the eggplant pizza.  The eggplant was shaved thin.  The pizza had red sauce, which I love and the crust was perfectly thin but not so thin that the slice drooped onto your hand.  It was a fantastic pizza.  Finally, for dessert, we had the Otto Sundae.  Real good and made with gelato."

For appetizers, we ordered the fried formaggio cheese and an app that I can't remember the name of that was basically fried pizza dough wrapped with prosciutto and topped with cheese. Both were just ok at best.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the linguine with mussels which was fantastic. The noodles had been cooked with saffron and they were really excellent. My friend has the baked ziti that was on special and it was phenomenal as well. \n\nFor dessert, we split the gelato sampler where you get to choose five flavors of gelato. We got chocolate, vanilla bean, pistachio, graham cracker and salted caramel. These were not very good at all. They weren't creamy and almost had the texture of ice milk, which was really disappointing. The flavors were pretty spot on but not all of them worked well as gelato flavors (I'm looking at you, graham cracker). \n\nThe service was decent, which is what I would expect at a place of this caliber."

The service was not great, heck it wasn't even good.  Let's get the bad part of the review out of the way.  We were seated towards the side near the back, and behind us were 2 other tables that the waitstaff had to keep squeezing by us to get back there.  Annoying.\n\nOur drinks were not kept filled, in fact, I think the waitress only asked once if we needed anything.  Other than that, she would walk by us very quickly and just say Enjoy.  At once point another table was madly and frantically waving their arms to get her attention, so she went over there to help them, and promptly disappeared before taking our dessert order.  She was gone quite awhile.  When she did come back, she took our order, but didn't write it down.  Time goes by, she comes back and double checks my order, and said, Oh, I got it wrong then, I'll have to put it in again.\n\nThe restaurant was not that busy, and this type of service was inexcusable in my book.  Especially at the prices you are paying.  I know its Vegas, everything is overpriced, but for a casual restaurant some prices were high for what you got (mostly talking about dessert). Plus we were not told about any specials, then a few minutes later we hear our waitress reciting specials to the table next to us!\n\nWe ordered an appetizer of fried eggplant.  The order was much bigger than I expected.  The waitress asked if I wanted dipping sauce with it, so I said yes.  Turns out that dipping sauce was an extra $2.  Thats fine, but I hate when restaurants do that, I feel like I'm getting the wool pulled over my eyes.  Eggplant and sauce were delicious.\n\nWe got a margherita pizza which was FABULOUS!  Crust, sauce and cheese were perfect!\n\nthe 2 salads were good, and decently sized (we got 2 smalls instead of sharing a large one)\n\nDessert, we each got a trio of gelato.  One combo was chocolate malt, espresso and graham cracker.  Second set was huckleberry sorbet, concord grape sorbet and vanilla gelato.  Each item tasted great, but the portions were skimpy for the accompanying price tag of $12 each set.  I know they are using local ingredients etc.  But when 2 desserts tally $24 they better be mind blowing and they werent.\n\nWould I go back? Yes, especially for the pizza."

I liked the outdoor seating area. Very cozy and very European. It was nice. \n\nFor lunch, we decided to share the Tuna salad and the Margherita pizza. For the salad, the menu read, \"Tuna Roasted Tomato Artichoke Caprese Burrata Pesto Cherry Tomato Salad\", a lot going on so I was a little intrigued at what the salad would look like.  It could also use some punctuation too.  The salad overall was a 3. A little too tangy for me to rave about it but nevertheless, it was tasty and enjoyable. I think they if they can simplify this salad, it would really go a long way. \n\nThe margherita pizza is what made this lunch for me. The crust was nice and thin, very tasty and had the right amount of cheese on it. I know it's pretty authentic to just place the whole basil leaves on the pizza but I never understood why restaurants do this because you can't get the taste of the basil in every bite. I prefer cooks and chefs to chiffonade the basil and then sprinkled on top. That way, the basil goes a long way.\n\nThe service here great.

Outrageous prices. The prices were horrible and the service was even worse. They gave us bread but brought out the olive oil when our dinner was coming out. They said they had no mushrooms or asparagus to put in our pasta which I saw plenty of people that did...not to mention I find it very hard to believe that an Italian restaurant has no vegetables period (as our waiter informed us). It was number 2 on our friend's list of places to eat but I think that list needs to be reevaluated. The location in the Venetian is nice but that is pretty much the best part of the restaurant. The others in our group did like their pizza and I thought it was decent so I threw in an extra star for that."

It was flavored well for a pomodoro but seemed somewhat out of place on the pizza over all.    Each slice of pizza had exactly one slice of mozzarella and exactly one leaf of basil, $18.    For those that are under the impression that Mario Batali is laboring back in the kitchen, you should reconsider.    This is a celebrity endorsed restaurant nothing more.    The wine list is kind of a joke.    Many glasses are in excess of $20 and some as much as $64.  Only two reds less than $15 and only one dry red.   I've had plenty of good wine in the $12-15 range why not offer some of those here?  I don't expect to pay $25 a glass even if it was, in theory, fine dining."

A long time before the waiter came to our table and I was ready to get up and leave.  The waiter came over, not apologetic, asking what we wanted to drink.  Me grumpy - replied that we were ready to order.  Waiter very calmly replied, yes, but what would you like to drink.  So then from that point, service was great.  Food came out quickly.   We ordered the margherita pizza with buffalo mozzarella - crust was perfect crispy but chewy too, sauce flavorful, mozzarella slightly smokey.   Also had caprese salad - expected balls of mozzarella and cut up tomatoes that you get at supermarket, but this was so good with soft mozz cheese, herbs, olive oil.  I've never raved about caprese salad before.  Now in retrospect, I liked the waiter - seem so European, no apologies, lunch should be enjoyed not rushed.  If I blurred my eyes, I was in Venice, St Marks square."

I was not impressed with Mozza (another Batali pizza place in CA), so my expectations were low. The cheese was insane! It was sooo fresh and creamy and light, it wasn't leathery at all! The dough stayed crisp at the bottom, which I have never seen before. Usually when u first get a thin crust pizza at your table, the first slice is nice and crisp, but the following slices get soggy and buckle when you pick them up. This one held it's shape like a crisp little cracker, but it had that unmistakeable chew of a pizza.  My GF was obsessed and she said it deserves 5 stars. I did wish the sauce had a little sweetness (it's more salty than sweet) and maybe a pinch of oregano. My other favorite Pizza place is Tirovino in LA.\n\n I was really disappointed with the gelato. I ordered the Graham Cracker, Almond Ice Milk, and Dark Chocolate Malt. They were packed in layers in a little metal cup, which irritated me, I wanted to taste each flavor, not have them all mashed together! Wtf?  I tried to separate them as best I could but the flavors were kind of boring and not as interesting as I thought they would be. The ice milk was the best but it wasn't a smooth creamy gelato, more like an icy sorbet. I couldn't taste the malt in the chocolate one at all, Too bad, because I love malt! The graham cracker texture was nice, but this needed a pinch of sea salt or something. I got a cone on the side and it looked fine, but tasted burnt. Anyway, it definitely wasn't worth $13. There are much better desserts to be had in Vegas, like the berry nutella crepes at Paris and Bellagio ;)"

We were not disappointed.   If you have not had water buffalo mozzarella (bufala), it's much more buttery (higher fat content) than american mozzarella--a different animal altogether (no pun intended).   The crust, because it's DOC, was also magnificent-- thin, crispy to the last bite, and you could taste the wood fire in it.  Just wonderful.  \n\nIncidentally, we also had the arancini and fried cauliflower (yummo).  Both were good.  Had two different glasses of red wine--both very nice.  The service was attentive.  Overall a very nice visit."

Im a big foodie and didn't even notice this was Iron Chef Mario Batali's Restaurant (yeah, I was THAT tired). \n\nFirst thing I have to say is that the Olive Oil they bring out with the bread (ask for bread service, not only is it delicious, its free!) is amazing, easily the best and the most flavorful olive oil I have ever tasted. What I recommend is to order a few different dishes and share amongst your party, italian style after all! We ordered the Pancetta and Goat Cheese, I'm not a big pizza person but boy was this delicious I couldn't stop eating it (The pizza's here can easily be shared by 2 people) We also ordered the Penne alla Norma, very tasty! But the real winner of this meal was the Marinated Chicken Paillard!! I HIGHLY recommend ordering this when eating here, it cannot be missed! AMAZING is the only word I can use to describe this dish, I still crave it each and everyday and so does the rest of my family! I could not figure out why this meal was so great and flavorful, this meal had a special quality about it that I couldn't put my finger on, but then I turned around and I saw, very discretely, Mario Batali's name and I quickly understood why this was a high quality meal. \n\nThank you Chef Batali, I praise you for this glorious meal. \n\nEverything about the meal was perfection (service was so-so though, that is until it was time to leave the tip! wink-wink) The atmosphere is also great, feels like your outside and they have some great entertainment. I will most defiantly be back on my next trip!"

Although the restaurant seemed full, we were promptly seated at a table that afforded a view of the square (i.e. I watched a \"statue\" throughout our entire meal).\n\nOur waiter was enthusiastic and I must note, pronounced the Italian perfectly (although he clearly wasn't Italian).  He guided us through the menu and since we weren't that hungry (and had dinner reservations for Bouchon), we decided on an appetizer and a pasta dish to share.  We got the gnocco frito, and per the waiter's suggestion, had prosciutto wrapped around it.  HEAVENLY!  I've never had anything like it:  it was almost like a savory funnel cake with salty prosciutto and finely grated fresh parmesan.  Omg, yum yum yum.  The portion was huge too - definitely a share-able appetizer!  We then got the spaghetti and meatballs, which is my favorite dish and I'm always on the search for the best meatball ever.  Were these it?  No, but I loved the spicy-ness of the dish and the freshness of the basil really paired well with the pasta.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Otto Enoteca was the wine.  Otto has an enomatic wine dispenser, which permits you to get small to large glasses of wine, based on what you like.  This means that your gamble on wine is actually quite diminished; something interesting for Vegas where gambling is so prevalent!  I took advantage of and got a small glass of the Brunello.  The bottle retailed for $220, but my small glass was just $17.50.  A coup, if you ask me, to sample a super rare vintage of one of my favorite wines.  Yay.\n\nHubby went the amari route and the manager gave us a very personalized walk through of the numerous selections, pointing out the specific ones beloved by Mario.  So special!  The manager seriously spent about 20 minutes just with us walking through all the various types, before we settled on 4 different ones to taste and savor.  And yes, artichoke liquer is actually tasty!\n\nAll in all, impeccable service, unique italian eats, and a great people-watching spot make this one a fun afternoon spot.  I would definitely go again and try the pizza, which looked amazing!  \n\nBut note:  Is it the best Italian you will ever have?  Nah, so I'm not sure I'd recommend this as a prime time dinner spot (especially with the price tag), but I did really enjoy it!\n\nOne weird thing worth noting:  we ordered soda water, but it wasn't until the end of the meal that I realized it was being poured from a fancy bottle instead of simply served from behind the bar.  And then the bill came:  $7/bottle.  Oooooooops."

Another asked for additional olive oil for his bread, his server told him that they give you enough for your bread and wanted to be sure that he would not waste the additional oil.\n\nAs for my food the fried cauliflower was heavily coated in uncooked batter and the pasta was extremely salty.  I sent the pasta  back but thanks to a language barrier (the busser did not speak good English), my dish returned with NO salt.\n\nOh well.  They took it off the check and comped my wine so I was satisfied.\n\nThis is still a good place for a quick bite, especially if you want to enjoy the show that is the Venetian."

All of the wait staff were extremely kind and helpful in making recommendations and taking care of any of our needs. Carlos our waiter was awesome and we even mentioned at the end of the meal how he was so smiley and attentive and it added to our meal. I only gave this place an 3-star rating because I wasn't particularly fond of my meal. \n\nI had the pasta carbonara and I think I had high expectations that just weren't met. I think I learned my lesson and shouldn't order items off the specials. My sister had the lasagna (and I had a few taste tests) and it was excellent. The sauce was so delicious. \n\nWe ended the meal with some housemade daily gelato. Olive oil, Vanilla Bean and Salted Caramel. I forgot to mention that we started the meal with a cheese plate. It was three different kind of cheeses - mozarella, fontina and parmesan. They serve it with bread and then small sides of honey, apricots and cherries. It was delicious but who doesn't like a good cheese.\n\nI thought the portion sizes were more perfectly fine.

Not because I don't think it deserves 5, but because I don't want people to think I give top ratings to everywhere I eat.  The truth is, I generally only rate a place if it is really good or really bad.....and I mean reallllly bad.  I don't like being negative or nitpicking unless they have truly offended me or made me feel they have stolen my money.  That being said, I've had nothing but great experiences here and so I can't help but give it the 5 Star treatment.\n\nThe cavatappi with lamb ragu dish is mind-blowing. I will admit, I'm a sucker for lamb and this dish is one of the reasons why. I must have had it for the first time 4-5 years ago and it's what keeps me coming back every time I am in Vegas.  The meat and cheese platters are delicious, but a little on the pricey side.  Not that it isn't worth it for the quality you get, but it can really make the bill add up if you go crazy (which I tend to do).\n\nFunny enough, I'd say the one thing you shouldn't get here is the pizzas.  I've had some friends that loved them and some that didn't. I haven't really tried them to be honest.  I just know that if I am going to spend the money to go out in Vegas, I wanna get something I can't normally get everyday. So I'd say if you venture out, try the unique dishes or the charcuterie, you'll love it.  If you just wanna eat some pizza, go find a local pizza spot and you'll walk away with some extra dough.....see what I did there....okay, I'll stop now."

Otto's has an eviable location and whilst staying at the Venetian hotel with my 70 year old mother-in-law and twin 7 year old boys, convenience and an easily acquired view (of the Venetian square) counted for a lot.  Unfortunately, our dining experience was ruined by the staff's refusal to provide a side of pasta with marinara sauce to my mother-in-law!  She's from back east, so she's used to family style Italian places where one gets a side of pasta with a main course. They had the audacity to suggest we purchase another entree of spaghetti and meatballs for $23!  I went escalated to the manager and received the same response. I was told at one point that because the food is prepared in a kitchen that's not actually on the immediate premises, custom orders are not possible. It surprises me that an Italian restaurant with these price tags wouldn't be able to produce a plate of \"pasta with marinara\" by request. Given the sponsor chefs (Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich) are of such notoriety, I was surprised and disappointed.  Maybe they treated us poorly because we had our 7 year old twin boys with us or we didn't look sufficiently sophisticated.  (You try looking good after chasing 7 year olds all day and dealing with your M.I.L). Very disappointing."

(sorry, I couldn't help it)\n\nOn their side, the pizza was thin, crispy, and as close to real Neapolitan pizza as I've had in a long time.  \n\nOther than that, the service was fair to good:  the place was very busy, but service was kind of slow and bordering on not attentive - long waits between the waiter's visits to our table.  \n\nDinner was longer than we wanted, and it felt even longer due to the setting at \"St. Mark's Square.\"  I realize that many people find the the fake street scene environment at the Venetian to be novel and even charming.   \n\nHowever, to me, the location was simply not relaxing - loud echoes like a gym full of people, lots of people.  The music of the amplified \"acoustic\" street performers sounded like it was in an echo chamber - the \"sky\" was vaulted and reflected any sound below.\n\nPeople-watching was interesting, but only one or two steps above the freak show on the strip, with the typical bachelorette parties in crotch length dresses, wasted dudes re-enacting The Hangover, and tee shirt covered pot bellies.  In short, a lot of American tourists.  This kind of sucked the charm factor down to near empty.  Ultimately, it was a mall...  in Las Vegas.\n\nAnd was a big mall.  Entering through Palazzo might have provided a shorter path to the restaurant.  As it was, the walk through the Venetian shops was looooong - both in and out.   \n\nTo summarize, the food was good, but it was pricey.   However, with lack-luster service in a setting that I found to be harsh, I don't need to return."

Despite being the smallest meatballs I've ever seen, the meal was good. I had an overpriced Bloody Cosmopolitan to wash it down and I think I enjoyed that too. (I couldn't pronounce most of the drinks either) It was powdery, but maybe it's supposed to be. I was worried that maybe I ordered a chick drink. My wife didn't say anything though.\n\nThe waiter and assistant waiter were both very cool, laidback, and casual as was the lady that showed us to our quiet table at the back.\n\nMy only hang-up about this place is their prices. They don't accurately reflect the kind of restaurant that this place actually is.

Three stars for the food and one star for the service.\n\nArrive at the restaurant at 11AM and the entire place was EMPTY so we thought the hostess would be glad to see some customers.  Boy, was I wrong!  She barely cracked a smile as she directed us to the seats.  After we placed our order with the waitress, the breadman came by with a plate of cold bread...didn't even bother to offer some olive oil or cracked black pepper (all the other tables that came after us had those offered tableside).  The waitress was literally one foot away from my wife when she tried to ask her for some olive oil...totally ignored my wife.  She didn't even come by to refill our water.  The last time we saw the waitress was when she shoved the dessert menu right in front of my wife's face...pretty rude.  C'mon, Mario Batali...if you are going to charge $20 for pizza at lunch, you should hire some more pleasant people.  \n\nAs for the food...mediocre.  Friday's special was the carbonara pizza.  It was a fair dish...the egg was slightly over-cooked.  DO NOT get the artichoke pizza.  The prosciutto they used was completely flavorless and the scariest part is...that more than half of each slice was pure fat!  So, as you bite into the slightly sour (from artichoke...tasted like they are from a can) and spicy (from chilli) pizza slice, you get a mouth full of white, greasy flavorless fat.  Disappointed...prosciutto should be full of flavor!!!  \n\nWe ate at Le Cirque the night before for Thanksgiving and the service & food were impeccable.  Mr. Batali has too many restaurants in Vegas and the quality is suffering.  Rather than caring about money and hiring rude but cheap servers and using less-than-quality ingredients, maybe he should care more about his customers."

We were walking through the Venetian earlier in the day and decided it would be a great spot for later. A four star review is probably a little generous however there were definitely four and five star aspects to my experience so I'll err in their favor.\n\nWe showed up for our 8:15 reservation were seated immediately in an \"outdoor\" table. It was nice to enjoy the views of the Venetian Courtyard while being serenaded by the nearby musicians.\n\nThe most daunting task and possibly my favorite part of the experience was selecting the wine. The rest of the group wanted red and I was in the mood for white so my decision was pretty simple. As a big Sauvignon blanc fan I just went with the only sauv blanc being sold by the glass. Now the other ladies got the pleasure of working with the sommelier to find their perfect bottle of red wine. I don't recall his name but he was just a plethora of knowledge. I could have listened to his descriptions and stories of the wine all day. If I could give 5 stars for just the sommelier I would. \n\nWe decided to go family style with our food and ordered the Caprese Burrata Pesto Tomatoes, Mozzarella Di Bufala, Cypress Grove Goat and one other cheese as our starter. For our mains, we split three pizzas which included the Margherita 'D.O.C.', Truffle and the special of the day, which was a pesto pizza with a garlic white sauce. So the cheeses were phenomenal, specifically the goat cheese. The caprese salad was pretty good too, as I'm not a tomato fan and the tomatoes almost seemed like roasted red peppers. Sadly, the pizza was the least favorite part of my meal. I only sampled the margherita and pesto pies, but they were just overall bland. The best part of the margherita pie was the fresh basil, but it just slid off the slice along with the mozzarella. The pesto pie was just lacking the usual burst of flavor that one would expect when eating pesto. \n\nAside from the sommelier, the rest of the service just seemed a little off. For example, after we finished our cheese and salad appetizers they did not remove our small plates. The cheese came with honeys and spreads which wouldn't have mixed well with the pizza that was just served, and we had to ask for new plates for dinner. That was the only faux pas but they were just generally lackadaisical. It took a pretty long time to settle our bill, even when paying with just one credit card for the group. \n\nI'm not ready to write off Otto Enoteca entirely as the appetizers, sommelier and atmosphere were pretty great. I'd just hope that if I were to return the other pizza options were more palatable."

Not the basic American version with heavy sauces and a ladle of sauce on a mound of spaghetti. \nWhile I have not tried the entire menu, I have had the privilege of having several items. \nI always start with the Ricotta Fritters. These are crunchy yet creamy deep fried balls of ricotta cheese. I dare you to try and eat just one.\nI usually follow that up with the Rigatoni with Ragu Napolitana. It is served a bit al dente, so if you prefer softer pasta, ask them to cook it a little longer. The ragu is light with a flavorful blend of shredded veal and pork. \nI have also had two different pizzas. The Margherita and the Sausage and Peppers. Both were wood fired with a light crisp crust. I preferred the Margherita. It was so light and fresh. The perfect amount of sauce as to not over power it. It's making my mouth water thinking about it.\nIn the past I have also tried the Ravioli (Butternut Squash with Browned Butter and Sage drizzled on top) and the Gemelli (with Sausage and Broccoli Rabe). Again both were very good.\nThe portions are a bit on the small size, however, they are deceivingly filling. \nI have read several reviews that mention they think that the price is a bit high, even for Vegas.

But you must consider the location, ambiance and the Operatic singers and minstrels that are playing and singing in the square. \nIf you are looking for quiet, you may want to sit inside. If not, the patio is great!\n\nBuon Appetito!"

Our server suggested the caprese salad with the prosciutto and copa.  Both good but very over priced.  We also ordered the eggplant and ricotta pasta which was not very good.  The pasta was too salty and too under-cooked.  I understand Italians cook pasta al-dente but our pasta was on the raw side.  This was probably my first and last time there.  I'd much rather eat across at Postrio."

Excellent choice I must say. We wanted to try something a bit heartier, so it was the short rib ravioli up next. Very tasty and a generous portion. The only drawback is the ravioli could of had more short rib meat inside, but still flavor tasty. The final course was some tasty cheese with cherries, apricot and black truffle honey. An enjoyable afternoon and tasty snack at this Batali restaurant."

I will go back for this dessert. The price of this dessert and the wine (we only went for a cheaper 250ml portion of red to share...can't remember which one...for about $15) are reasonable, especially considering that we had an operatic floor show in fake St Mark's Square.

This lovely little spot in the Venetian is wonderful. We got at table \"outside\" (which is really inside the Venetian) and Marissa, our waitperson, couldn't have been more engaging and knowledgeable and Daniel was very attentive. We ordered a small selection of cheeses to start off. The cheeses (parmesan, ricotta and taleggio) were a wonderful way to start along with the bread and oil/balsamic they bring out. The five of us all ordered pasta - a different selection \nfor each person but we passed around bites so we all got to try everything. One plate came out later than the others so the manager brought out a small dish to try until the entree came out (without asking or prompting - this is what a top quality restaurant does). It was made of pumpkin and farro with a smoked cheese - it was quite good. For my entree, I had the short-rib ravioli that was flavorful and simply done - exactly what I wanted. My daughter got the penne alla Norma which was my second choice as I love both eggplant and good ricotta. This was delicious too. Not one speck of food remained on any plate at the end of the meal and we even split a decadent dessert five ways - a honey semifreddo with poached pears. This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas. The service is top notch and the food is amazing."

This one is at the mid-level price range so if you want to scratch that Italian food itch, this is a solid moderately priced option. \n\nRather than being set in a dark restaurant the 'outdoor seating' vibe makes you feel like you're in an outdoor Italian sidewalk cafe. That makes it casual and relaxed, including occasional performances on the town square under the faux Venetian 'sky'.\n\nThe menu offers a decent range of unpretentious simple Italian dishes and a robust wine list. The prices are pretty reasonable for the most part for the quality of food. I say relatively because much of Vegas fine dining is overpriced, including Mario Batali's restaurants. It's not the food prices that are the problem, it's the drinks and wine that are jacked up to the top end of the scale. \n\nOverall, you can count on a delicious meal here with decent service featuring all the things we love about true Italian fare. \n\nThat's why we come every time in Vegas. It usually works out to $50-$70 a person all-in. \n\nCheers!"

Located in the Venetian, open air next to the ongoings in the main \"square\" food was a great surprise. We ordered the ricotta and pancetta fritters, one was cheesy other was salty, mix those and it was delicious! Paired them with 2 glasses of Italian wines (recc by the staff) and the sausage-pepper pizza. Yum the crust was just right with burnt edges, fresh ingredients esp the meats, he has a rotating meat stand in the center of the restaurant. Loved it! Decor is lovely reminding one of a outdoor place in Italy. Definitely worth a stop here!"

My daughter's pizza was brought out within 10 minutes of ordering, which I thought was a good idea to keep her occupied.  However, she completed her whole pizza and our food was still not out (40 mins later) so she had to sit through our whole meal with nothing in front of her.\nI had the gemelli pasta.  Pasta was way undercooked.  I know what al dente is.  This was undercooked.  The pasta had a horrible, dry texture and the sauce was practically flavorless.  The broccoli rabe was also undercooked in my opinion.  The sausage was nothing special and the whole dish did not come together at all.\nThe bill for the table came to $177 for pasta and pizza.  One pizza came out cold and the pasta's...........well you could get the same at Olive Garden.  Another strike for Vegas strip restaurants.  As a local, I far prefer eating off the strip for better quality at a lower price. #touristtrap"

The dish was absolutely amazing!   I could have definitely has a whole other serving of it as it was that good.  The pasta itself was the best part as it was cooked perfectly and had this amazing consistency to it.  The sauce was absolutely divine and made me want to fill a thermos with it and drink it.   I definitely recommend this spot.   While the dishes seem basic they are very well made.  It really makes you appreciate the quality in a simple well-made dish.   \n\nFancy decor.  If you eat in the venue it is a nicely decorated spot with dozens of wine bottles adorning the walls.   \"Outside\" seating has you in a fenced Ibarra of the Grand Canale Shoppes under the artificial sky ceiling that adds the perfect touch to the meal"

The hostess was sweet and didn't even seem to care that we looked like little drowned rats (and we were too hungry to care). The server and his assistant were very personable and even gave hugs when requested (albeit very tentatively... probably not something they are asked for on the reg).

Her assistant, Nikki, took care of our immediate needs (water, bread, etc) in a way rarely seen outside of New Orleans or San Francisco.\nNow for the food itself:\nWe started with the Caramelized Onion Bruschetta-- it was amazingly savory; with a slight hint of bitterness. Super yummy! Next was the Caprese insalata. There is nothing more perfect than fresh mozzarella and roasted tomatoes, unless it is also paired with a perfect pesto. Ahhhh.\nMy final foray on this journey, was the Rigatoni. The   pork had an unctuous fatty hint that took it to a whole new level of wonderment.

I should preface this by saying that I've been to other Mario Batali restaurants, specifically Carnevino and Mozza, so I had hope that this one could live up to the other two.  I was sadly mistaken.\n\nThe service was spotty and for the most part rather bad, the busser or server assistant didn't even know what types of hot tea they had, and also didn't think they had honey for it either.  It also took half an hour for the server to make his way over to our table even though he only had the 4 tables in the backroom we were in.  The food also didn't make it's way out in a timely manner either, but I don't know if this was the kitchen's fault or the server was just slow at putting the food order in, but the table next to us, who sat down 20 minutes after us, go their food first, very disappointing.\n\nNow for the food.  I had their version of cioppino, and was not pleased with the quantity/quality for the price.  I'm not saying I didn't finish it, but I was starving at that point.  I was happy to have some of the pizza the table ordered and also had a few bites of the pasta norma, which was quite tasty.  The cold salads that they offer at the top of the menu were quite good, and I thought were honestly the best part of the meal.  The lentils were dressed nicely and cooked just right, they were al dente so held up well.  Their eggplant caponata was also quite tasty, although it had more peppers in it then I'm used to, but still tasty.\n\nOverall, I am not planning on coming back here ever again, there's way better Italian here in Las Vegas for the price."

I am very happy to say it met my expectations in every way, from service, to food, and even price! \nMy other half and I came here on a random date night. Even though the restaurant wasn't easy to get to, I love the location. It's fancy, but still semi casual with people in jeans at the bar. Also a great place to people watch as its an indoor patio inside the Venetian's canal shops. \nOur server was so on point. Literally the second the hostess seated us, she was behind her offering wine and water. We asked about appetizers and I told her the type of cheese and meat I usually like and she came back with the perfect platter. The truffle honey to pair with the cheese is to die for. I could eat that on anything, and continued to dip my bread, cheese, meat, and even Brussel sprouts in there. \nWith the wine, cheese, and brussels so good, I was waiting for something to be wrong!\nNope, did not happen. Our entrees were served and they were Italian perfection! Fresh al dente pasta, with ingredients that matched perfectly. The pasta servings were actually decent sizes, not huge where its unfinishable. Even the herbs used made a noted flavor to the dish. I felt like Mario Batali himself was back there critiquing and Mr. Bastinach was across from me judging the plate. \nI will make a point to come back here and try the pizza and other pasta dishes. \nAmazing in every sense of the word."

Everything was amazing: our server was amazing, the menu was amazing, our food was amazing, and our table on the patio was amazing (in the shadow of the intriguing leaning tower of salumi). \n\nI had to chuckle when the waitress took our pasta orders and mentioned that the pasta was prepared al dente but she could have it cooked more if we wanted, so it would be soft. It was a sweet offer. Perhaps she mistook us for people from the Midwest or something, but I laughed out loud (which was not polite, but it was a gut reaction) when my 8 year old said he liked his pasta cooked properly -- al dente. She understood the message precisely and what we received was perfectly cooked pasta with extremely flavorful sauces. So flavorful, in fact, that we acted like we were from the Midwest and sopped up the sauce from the empty plates with our bread. :) \n\nWe didn't really want to leave so we looked at the dessert menu. I almost choked on my tongue when my teenager said he wanted the \"three flavors of gelato for $12\". WHAT, I thought. (Not really.  \"What?\" is what I said; WTF is what I thought.)  But then both kids wanted that, and after reading the flavors we all wanted that. So we picked our three flavors, all four of us, and -- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT -- spent almost $50 on essentially four scoops of ice cream. But what ice cream it was. Awesome textures and flavors. The Olive Oil gelato was the most interesting ice cream I've ever eaten.  An experience we are glad we didn't miss. \n\nWe'll certainly return on a future visit to Las Vegas, or New York, or Los Angeles, or"

It's not that I want to give Otto a 1 star, but I am compelled to.\nLet me start out with some of our mistakes or variables that you have to account for when eating out:\n- we came a little after 11am on a Saturday morning (aka right when they open)\n- we expected a lot from this place since it has a \"Mario Batali\" on its sign\nOur server was quite nice, tried very hard to sell us the appetizers, but we only wanted to grab a quick bite before gambling - plus, we had to leave at 2pm to catch our flight, so we are basically in a rush.\nThe bread was okay - my friend said it was grainy. Their breadsticks came in a package - they were alright.\nWhen the food came...that's when the nightmare started. We had a long night of partying, were running on 4hours of sleep and planned to go to the Wynn Buffet but decided there was not enough time, so Otto it is.\nBack to the food. I thought Italian food is supposed to be all about olive oil, tomatoes, basil and al dente pasta. What we got was SALT SALT SALT. We got:\n- overly salty lasagna\n- overly salty other pastas (I forgot the names)\nThey were horribly salty. My friend ended up telling the server his pasta was too salty (and the pastas were nowhere near al dente - some were over and under cooked). He then ended up getting an arugula salad with parmesan cheese - that wasn't great either because it was overly oily.\nOverall, the food didn't look as pretty as the Venetian atmosphere surrounding us and I probably won't be going back again. \n\nLesson of the day: take into consideration the variables I mentioned above and hopefully you'll have a better experience here like most of the other yelpers."

The mozerella alla caprese, comprised of mozzarella, pesto, pine nuts and tomatoes seemed fresh and was fresh tasting.  The penne alla Norma was also well received.  Unfortunately, dessert brought salted caramel gelato that lived up to its name as it had large bits of sea salt that weren't entirely welcome and harsh.  The olive oil gelato was silky and definitely interesting.  Overall, our meal was pleasant, but sadly, lacking the finishing touches that should be a Mario standard.

We sat outside which I would recommend as there was a lot going on to watch and see."

Particularly when you go to a place with popular chef ...\n\nSo here are the things that I did not like in Mario Batali's restaurant\n1) Gnocco fritto is supposed to be served with meats and cheeses not alone! If you don't believe me check out \nWikipedia http://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnocco_fritto#section_1 \n... I know you can't read Italian but just look at the picture! There is salami next to it!... You could get it right if you order Gnocco fritto for 9 $ then a couple of cured meats for 20$ and one cheese for 5$ but it gets pretty expensive for an appetizer!\n2) mozzarella di bufala was subpar at best. I'm actually fairly sure it was just plain mozzarella, not bufala !\n3)the pizza had a gallon of oil on top. Seriously it was was  dipping! I've had better pizzas (even in the states!)\n4) my husband got spritz and was perplexed... He thought the mix of wine/aperol was Not right (and usually there is not olive in it even thou i googled it and found out that one version of spritz has olive in it so maybe this is what they were going for.)\n\nHere is what I liked:\n1) prosciutto di Parma and bresaola were good\n2) my husband seemed pleased by his pasta with clams even If it was quite spicy\n3) the honey served with the mozzarella was good\n\nSo, overall...food was ok but since it's a famous chef and all I expected more... Maybe Mario batali could take another trip to Italy? And pick up better titles for his books (Molto gusto sounds pretty weird!)"

One in our party ordered a caprese salad, which was served with hot stewed tomatoes. This was communicated to us ahead of time, but given the warning on the menu that they do not adapt menu items based on 'capricious whims' we assumed the chefs knew what they were doing. In this case, they did not.\n\nThe truffle pizza delivered on truffle goodness. The asparagus and preserved lemon pizza was fine, but I wouldn't order it again. \n\nThe vegan at our table was stuck ordering a side of broccoli rabe. The broccolini was so stringy that she nearly choked. Not recommended.\n\nThere are a lot of great dining options in Vegas. Our group experienced several of them--Bouchon, Sushi Samba, and even the unassuming La Pizza in Paris were better than this. You have other options--keep walking."

            "review": "Ok, where to start.  Figured I wanted casual italian from a celebrity chef, and made the family walk from the Cosmopolitan to the Venetian for what I heard would be a better meal then Scott Conant's  DOCG Enoteca (especially any fish based on what two 'foodies' had told me).  All I can say is big mistake, BIG MISTAKE!  The atmosphere at the Venetian - well designed and entertaining (despite being older then some of the newbies) - was worth the walk but the food was ok, sub-par if you consider that the menu and items were done in conjunction with a  celebrity chef (Mario Batali).  There was not one item ordered (except the Penne alla Norma) that was up and beyond what I get locally in a Detroit suburb's italian restaurant.  We started with 3 Verdure dishes (olives, beets in saba, and farro verde) - the farro was good, but the other two tasted grocery store bought level at most (lacked depth and uniqueness) never again. Next I ordered another item recommended by the server - Insalte la supurba (I think), marinated tuna and white anchovy salad - what a disaster, not only did the tuna lack any kind of oomph or upgrade from Starkist albacore white, the anchovy (white, house cured) lacked character and carried an unusual stench rendering it inedible for me.  The salad was returned only after one bite and I genuinely feared furthering my culinary adventures here.  Thank god my wife had ordered a spring pasta(the only pasta made in-house) with english peas and vegetables, that was acceptable - otherwise I would have rated the place as a solid one star eatery.  Not all is bad here, the location (in the middle of the 'Piazza de Marco' (of the Venetian Hotel)) is outstanding all it needed was a few pigeons to complete the experience - but in retrospect, we should have ventured to Wolfgang Puck's place just a few steps away then waste a Franklin on something not worth the mile walk on the Vegas strip."

And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.\n\nThe Service\nWe decided to eat at the busiest time in the evening so much of the issues with the service were understandable. In fact we were there right after a large convention let out on Tuesday. The hostess was very nice and was able to seat us at the bar which ended up saving us from a long wait. Once at the bar we received our water and menus. Later the bread and oil made its way to the table/bar. Our waiter was as attentive as he could be seeing that the place was crazy busy. \n\nThe Food\nWe had a salad, rice balls, and the pork raviolis, and of course bread and oil. The salad was so simple it didn't inspire me to want to finish it. The rice balls were just tasteless. And the raviolis had a processed taste to them which wasn't too bad but I could definitely make better ones at home. Bottom line...if you have to eat here just get the bread and oil with a nice over priced glass of wine.\n\nThe Experience\nUnfortunately poor Otto's gets a one star because the food just didn't pass the \"Can I make this better at home test\" plus the price was not in line with the taste. The portions were all out of line with what a normal human consumes at dinner which made us search for a hefty desert after we left. Thank god the Venetian has tons of places to get a tasty desert. I mean it's amazing what a tasty treat can do to make you forget about an tastless dinner. \n\nHere is a tip for the management!\nThe view of all the goings on in the court yard at the Venetian is priceless. And the fact that the huge Sands convention center brings in countless hungry visitors in the evening who will eventually fly back to their home towns, makes your place unique. In other words you have a captive audience. So you really don't have to change a thing. Many of your customers are expensing  their meals and could careless what the food taste like. Perhaps it would be a wise idea to raise your prices and ship in food from Fazolis. The food would taste better for sure and the profits would sky rocket."

The broccoli rabe was inedible. I had to send it back, and I rarely send back food. Anyone who knows how to cook this vegetable knows that this time of year is the end of the season and the stems are tougher and need to be sliced or chopped and cooked separately to soften them up before adding the leaves.\n\nNone of my party of 5 had anything positive to say about the food. The meatballs in my colleagues meatballs were literally the size of meatballs you put on as a pizza topping. He couldn't stop talking about how small they were. Laughable if it wasn't for the price we paid.\n\nI'm normally more cordial and constructive in my comments but this meal was offensive. I'd give it one star but the hostesses, servers and manager were both nice and professional.\n\nYour empire is only as good as its foundation, which is the quality of your food, the value of the experience and the customers willing to pay for it. Forget that at your peril."

The beer menu was TWO beers, one bottled and one on tap. Both boring. I can go on and on about just how un-enjoyable this place was, but I've already wasted more time on it than it deserves. \nThis establishment proves what we should have known from the start... it is nearly impossibe to get GOOD food so close to tourist attractions.

Talk about fresh-made salumni!\n\nWhen the elevator doors open to Shop level, I'm immediately transported to my Happy Place as we stroll by the Canal on our way to Otto in the piazza in St. Marks Square.\n\nWe love starting with a glass of rose Prosecco - it's refreshing, cleanses your palate, and sets a fun tone for the rest of the meal. A variety of salumi and formaggi is served with a trio of condiments: brandied cherries that are incredibly addicting, an apricot mustardo, and truffle honey. \n\nHere's a tip: try the taleggio cheese with the truffle honey. Heaven! The funkiness of the taleggio is complemented by the earthiness and sweetness of the truffle honey. Another favorite combo? The gorgonzola dolce and a bit of brandied cherry. Mmmm... Want something creamier? The ricotta is house made and super fresh.\n\nBased on a recommendation, we tried the fried brussel sprouts. Oh holy he!! they were good! I think I like these better than the cauliflower frittelle...\n\nNext, a little pasta (love the bucatini all'Amatriciana) served perfectly al dente. And last, but not least, the braised pork shoulder we lovingly nicknamed \"sweet meat\". Super tender served with a glaze of Averna and apple reduction and topped with fresh cucumbers & thin slices of (Fresno?) chiles. SMH it's so good. Need a starch in your diet? The smashed potatoes are aMAZing.\n\nAnd you've got to save room for dessert. Seriously. Jessica makes the most delectable, tasty treats and she is so creative AND the desserts are updated so the offerings are fresh and new. The Honey Semifreddo includes moscato poached pears and marzipan cake and is even better than it sounds!\n\nThank you again, Otto, for a wonderful, wonderful meal!"

On the positive side our service was very good and the server was very helpful with his personal suggestions and honest opinions. The food came out quick and was very hot. \nOn the down side the food is pricey for what you get. I had the special shrimp pizza for $20 and while good it was not \"that\" good. The special melon salad with prosciutto was a major disappointment. The melon was very unripe and was hard. There was way too much mint on the salad which overpowered the bland melon also the tiny sliver of prosciutto  did not justify the $14 price tag. The assortment of fritti we tried were a  mixed bag with the cauliflower being excellent but the squash blossoms squirted out their hot filling right onto my wife making quite a mess. The server said that happens some times.... Maybe a warning would be appropriate. We did like the gelato sundae dessert as it was rich and creamy and not over sweet. \nI wanted to love this place but the $100 price tag was just not justified.\nI will continue to wear my orange Mario crocs with pride"

My mother's panzanella was light and refreshing, although a touch too sweet for my tastes.  For an entree, I had the braised pork shoulder, which the waiter said was a house specialty.  The meat was a little dry and stringy and the sauce was cloyingly sweet.  My mother had the pasta ala norma.

The next table was not in the corner and provided lots of good people watching as well as room to move.

I liked the white sardines but they were a bit chewy. Perhaps this is the case with sardines as I am no expert as I usually get them either out of a can or fried. They were palatable though.The peppers did not have any personality and I am not sure if they were freshly roasted or plucked out of a jar.\n\nFor our main she shared an eggplant pizza. For a pizzeria, it was not so hot. The eggplant seemed to be an afterthought just raw unseasoned thin slices of eggplant plopped on top beneath arugula which, unlike my CSA arugula, was not peppery or spicy and was quite bland. It certainly was not cooked long enough for any of the flavors to meld together and then add the arugula. :(((\n\nIt was quite evident from the taste of everything that this is a numbers business without that touch of love Mario and Joe devote to their true restaurants. The atmosphere was pleasant enough and the eye catchers snazzy, such as the tower in front, a salumeria I believe it was, but I doubt Mario is ever in the kitchen except to trip over the boxes of food brought in and stub his orange clad Croc toe.

In short, your stomach will likely be satisfied and your wallet will likely not be empty. \n\nHowever, I cannot overlook a very racist remark Mario Batali made not long ago. It will not stand I'm sure folks will chime in with contrary opinions. Feel free but just like Mr. Chik-Fil-A who chose to use his position and power to spew messages of hate, Mr. Batali has to face the consequences of revealing private opinion in a public setting.

The bread was good and I like how it came with the dipping oil and vinegar.  They brought out 3 pieces for 2 people which I didn't quite understand why they didn't have even number of pieces.  But I guess that was all that would fit on the late.  \n\nThe menu contains more wine choices that food so if you want to try a different wine, this would be a great place to go.  I had the rigatoni ragu with veal and pork shredded in tomato sauce with the pasta.  The portion wasn't too big but just right and saved enough room for dessert.  I liked the meat as it was different from meatballs but filling.  During the meal, we asked for more bread and the assistant waiter was very quick to respond to our request and told us to let him know if we wanted more.\n\nFor dessert we had the tiramisu.  It's not the usual tiramisu that I've had but it was good and I liked the espresso gelato.  It's definitely pricey at $14 though. \n\nIt wasn't a cheap meal, $21 for pasta, $12 for drink, and then dessert  but it was a great atmosphere and meal."

We were a little disappointed this time because they were out of pepperoni pizza that they make there so \"settled\" for the four cheese pizza. The four cheese pizza at Otto's has each cheese separated so none overpowers the others and was very good - heck, we may even order it on purpose next time! I see some of the other reviews not loving the pizza here and maybe we do in some part for the romance of it, but what I really feel is that America's fast food pizzas are thick and greasy and overly saucy, so that a crisp, clean pizza like the ones at Otto's doesn't measure down (not up!) to them. Give it a try, savor the individual flavors and savor the moment, ask for advice on the wine if you need it (the staff is great about that), and enjoy the surrounding architecture."

She was attentive, helpful, and had great insight into Vegas history and sights.  \n\nWe split the verdure grande platter.  Everything on it was excellent, except the beets.  (They were probably fine, but I don't care for them.)  I loved the garbanzos with tuna, the farro, the lentils and the squash.  The broccoli with chile was fine, as was the eggplant caponata.  I wish I had asked for the marinated olives.  \n\nJeff and I split a pizza that had goat cheese, prosciutto and a light tomato sauce.  The dough was thin and crisp.  The saltiness of the prosciutto was ameliorated by the sliced green onions and the cheese.  A bit salty, but a delicious bite.  \n\nWe were lucky that the olive oil gelato was available.  Each bite was excellent.  There were buttery, flowery notes, but not the gross mouth feel nor overly sweet aftertaste of some ice creams.

I forgot what i was drinking but it was a nice big Italian beer for $8...not bad prices for Las Vegas. Just as we took our first sip of beer our table was ready.  Sometimes I think restaurants want you to order a drink at the bar even though your table might be ready...it is a smart business move but as a consumer I find it tacky...oh well!\n\nWe were given a great table in the fake outside. These restaurants crack me up with all of the fake elements. I feel like I'm eating on the set of a movie every minute. When are they going to make fake birds come over and try to eat my real bread? At least I hope it's real...the bread I mean!\n\nI made a special request from the waiter. I wanted my pasta cooked in a fresh pot of water with no salt. He said no problem. Some girl in our party...I don't even know who she was but she started giving me a hard time. Telling me the rest of the table was going to have to wait for there food because of me. She also started saying other things but I tuned her out. I didn't know she worked for the restaurant. Oh wait she doesn't! Just completely annoying! I'm still wondering who invited her? I would give her 1 star if I could review her!\n\nHere is the funny part. All of our pasta hit the table and someone at the table said, \"can we get grated cheese?\". The food runner then said, \"I would recommend you try the pasta first because our water we cook the pasta in is really salty and people always complain it is too salty!\" I looked right at this girl and said,\"Wow that's ironic the food runner would say that!!!\". I then looked at the food runner and said,\"Load me up on the cheese because I had my pasta cooked in unsalted water!\". I then shot a dirty look at this girl sitting at our table. She knew I directed it at her but she had no come back at me! I've never met someone who would attack someone at there own table for a special request!!! I hope she liked her salty pasta dish!\n\nI had the pasta with the shrimp and it was really good. Guess what? It wasn't salty at all. In fact, others at the table commented at how smart I was for requesting fresh unsalted water!  Sometimes it is good to ask and I was so happy with this restaurant honoring my special request.  A slammed restaurant that still cares about making there customer happy.  I love it!!!\n\nWe also started with a pizza too and it was really good! I was really surprised at how tasty everything we ordered. I would come back here for dinner and drinks but I will not be dinning with that mean girl ever again. I am so glad I have no idea who she is and hopefully I'll never see her again. You gotta love Vegas!!!"

            "review": "Las Vegas is Disneyland for adults and dining at Enoteca Otto Pizzeria in the Venetian is a pretty good representation of that.  Enoteca Otto Pizzeria has both indoor and outdoor (or pseudo outdoor) dining here.  To get the maximum faux design, you will want to eat in their outdoor dining area that is modeled after an Italian train station.\n\nThe pseudo outdoor area has nice tables.  At the center of the restaurant is a cylinder train tower that appears to be used for curing meats.  The canal shoppes surround this restaurant (fake buildings, statues that come to life and that blue sky, which I think looks better here than the skies at the Forum Shops or Paris).\n\nOtto (as well as its surroundings) features that Disneyfied decor/atmosphere, but it also has the backing of a celebrity chef (Mario Batali).  We went here for lunch and the pricing was reasonable (when compared to the many overpriced Vegas restaurants).  Pizzas went about $18 while pastas were about $20 or less.  You would expect to pay at least that for most sit-down restaurants in nice Vegas casinos.\n\nThe complimentary bread was packaged crispy breadsticks followed by focaccia bread (with olive oil and balsamic vinegar).  Standard stuff.\n\nWe ordered the tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula pizza.  This is one of the better pizzas Mario Batali and Nancy Silverton serve at Pizzeria Mozza in West Hollywood.  This pizza at Otto was okay but not great.  The pizzas had a thin and crispy crust, but it lacked both the flavor and the chewy and crispy texture of the Mozza crust.\n \nThe flavor of the pizza at Otto was okay.  It was a little salty, but that is kind of common with these prosciutto pizzas.  The pizza had too much tomato sauce as it oozed out with each bite.\n\nWe also had the Brussels sprouts with pancetta.  Brussels sprouts can be a little off-putting, but I have had good versions of it like the Brussels sprouts salad with vibrant fruit at The Bazaar or the tender Brussels sprouts with salty pancetta and creamy parsnip puree at AOC.  These Brussels sprouts were boring in flavor.\n\nIn addition, the pancetta was not good.  It did not really taste like pancetta.  Instead, it tasted like country ham.  While I was not a big fan of the flavor, they were definitely generous with the portion size.\n\nBefore ordering, the staff informed me that none of their pastas were housemade.  It was disappointing, but we forged ahead and went with a thick spaghetti dish that came with tomato, cured pork and onion.  Unfortunately, the pasta was served a little cold.  Also, the tomato sauce looked like it had dried on the spaghetti; it appeared that it had been sitting around for a while (it also had that appearance of re-heated pasta though I doubt the cooks would do that here).\n\nThe flavor was not that great.  It just tasted liked cold tomato sauce. There was not much of the pork and onion.  My friends really did not enjoy the dish and asked the server to remove the dish.  Not something I would do.  No matter how bad I usually eat whatever is put in front of me.  What can I say?  I am a good guest.  The staff did kindly remove the item off the bill without further discussion.\n\nFor dessert, they were out of our first choice (fried dates) so we settled on a scoop of housemade salted caramel gelato.  The gelato was not well presented.  They filled the gelato in a cold sundae cup.  There was not much gelato above the rim of the sundae cup though.  It was flat too--like someone had flattened the top with a spatula.\n\nDespite the presentation, the gelato was actually quite good (and better than the gelato we had at Mario Batali's other and more expensive Vegas restaurant Carnevino).  The gelato was cold and creamy.  The flavor was good.  It was both salty and sweet.  They sprinkled some sea salt on it to give it a more pronounced salty taste.  Despite the salt flavor though, the sweetness of the caramel still came across.\n\nService was very good.  We were served by a waiter and a waitress. Both servers were dressed casually and they were friendly and funny but also polite and attentive.\n\nAfter having mostly positive experiences at Mozza, I was hoping that Otto could become a good Vegas spot for tasty food at reasonable prices.  Unfortunately, most of the food here was average to below average.  Otto is definitely a Vegas restaurant in how it makes the most of its faux but still nice atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the food here is too similar to many other Vegas restaurants in how it is not worth the money and lacking in both flavor and quality ingredients.\n\nComplimentary parking (including valet) is available at the Venetian Hotel."

You need to accept, right now, that you will not possibly be able to experience all the amazing things Vegas has to offer.  In fact, as much as I plan my trips (and boy do I plan them!) there is inevitably a moment when I walk by something and think, \"why didn't I make time for THAT???\"\n\nI tell you that - to tell you this.  Understand that Vegas is a lot about knowing your price points and researching the best value for your money.  Example:  If a quick McDonald's breakfast and coffee (yum) is just as good as a gourmet omelet from Mon Ami Gabi (at the Paris - YUM!) then save the money and spend it somewhere else. \n\nOk, back to the review.\n\nWhy you should try this place:\n-Ambiance, Ambiance, Ambiance, value, value, value for that ambiance\n-Located in the Venetian along the Canal shops, with occasional live music nearby\n-Great food for Mid-Price point ($20-30 entree, with apps separate)\n-Extensive Wine List, approachable prices\n-Service is quick, lots of tables, easy to get reservation (use opentable.com!)\n-Food is authentic, southern style with red sauces, lots of garlic and homemade sausage (not as good as my Nonna's, but then again, nothing ever will be!)\n-Skip the dessert and grab a gelato at the nearby gelateria and stroll your way back through the shops\n-Consider splitting a pizza (6 thin crust slices) and some side appetizers\n\nWhat you need to keep in mind:\n-A reservation is a good idea, just because Vegas can get busy FAST.\n-This is not superfine dining.  Don't expect a really posh atmosphere but understand that everything in the Venetian feels a bit classy and you can totally be dressed up if you want to, either way, you will fit in.\n\nMangia!"

I remember getting little containers filled with beets and rabe and mushrooms, and eating them alone in Washington Square Park. This Otto is less affordable than the original--even New York can't rip you off quite like Vegas--but it's equally pleasant, with excellent food and a casual, friendly ambiance.\n\nOtto is in the Venetian, in the central spot formerly occupied by Enoteca San Marco, which was more or less Otto by another name. You dine faux al fresco, under the painted Venetian sky, and you yield to the gleeful corniness of your surroundings. My husband and I came for a late dinner, right off a Friday night flight to Vegas. We had a reservation, but it looked like we could've walked in. Our waiter Eli L. was excellent. He took his time recommending both food and wine, and attended to all our needs with warmth and absolute competence.\n\nWe drank red wine by the glass--Montepulciano and Barbera--and indulged in a wonderful meal. There was fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic, and we ordered a big spread of starters. We got prosciutto di Parma and coppa, which were both excellent, as well as a plate of gooey taleggio served with black truffle honey and syrup-stewed cherries and apricots. We also got a pot of Otto pickles, which overflowed with baby carrots, cauliflower, fennel, radish, and turnip, all crisp and zippy with brine. Feeling extra indulgent, fresh off the plane, we got the caprese with oven-roasted cherry tomatoes, pesto, and milky burrata. Entrees were probably unnecessary at this point, but we did finish our pastas with alacrity. I had the linguini special, cooked a nice al dente with shrimp, garlic, and chile. My husband had the tagliatelle with butternut squash, brown butter, and sage. This one was too sweet for me, but he liked it. We ended this decadent meal with a bowl of sorbet and gelato--huckleberry, lemon, and olive oil, all perfect and perfect together.\n\nDinner was expensive, but that tends to happen in Vegas, and I thought it was very worthwhile. The food, service, and atmosphere were all on point, and I'd recommend Otto to anyone looking to sit down to a good Italian meal."

It was fine. Maybe I was looking for wonderful. I've had margarita (I know I'm spelling it wrong) pizza before that was so special in it's simplicity, because it was handmade and oven-fired, with flavors and textures that made your brain light up, but this pizza was just okay and not worth the $20 you end up spending on it. The lasagna was good, solid. Still, not amazing.  When we got our bill, $71total, it hurt a little bit to spend that kind of money on this meal, even with the great atmosphere and service.

The Barbera was wonderful, but when  got to the bottom of the glass I drank in a large wad of sediment.  My glass had been the last poured from the bottle and they weren't paying attention.  I then had the tiramisu and some coffee.  The tiramisu tasted nice, but the mascarpone mixture was the consistency of peanut butter.  It was so thick it was sticking in my mouth.  We didn't see much of our waitress, but the busboy was incredible.  He was very attentive and even helped us with more coffee when our waitress had disappeared.  Not the worst italian food, but for their prices it was very disappointing."

This is probably one of the only 3 stars I frequent a few times a year because I'll bring guests here.  \n\nWhat I like is that you can get more authentic unique Italian dishes such as the Bucatini all' Amatriciana.  All of the pastas are served really al dente and salted because it is cooked in the pasta salt water.   The taste is real rich becuase it is cooked in bacon...yummm\n\nThe rigatoni is also really delicious which is small spiral shaped pasta served in a cauliflower ragu with garlic and chili flakes...very tasty.\n\nThe pastas were delicious but they are around $15-20 and come in small portions.  I think this place is a good spot for lunch, but as many other reviewers have mentioned, the service is attrociious.\n\nI stiffed someone for the first time in years and for someone who's worked in F&B in my past life, it takes alot to do this.  Nevertheless, the food is good."

            "review": "We enjoyed Otto several times while in Vegas.\n\nOur first visit, we started with Caprese (Burrata, Pesto, Cherry Tomatoes). The burrata was amazing and the pesto tasted fresh and bright. The cherry tomatoes seemed picked at the peak of flavor - they were so wonderfully sweet! We enjoyed the Caprese so much that we ordered it the subsequent two times we dined at Otto. \n\nNext, we tried the Grilled Pacific Tuna with Sicilian pesto with broccoli rabe as a side. The tuna was grilled to medium rare and has a great, fresh flavor. The pesto and greens scattered atop the dish added to the great melding of flavors on the plate. The broccoli rabe, unfortunately, was bitter to the point that I couldn't manage more than one bite. \n\nDessert was a trio of gelatos: dark chocolate malt, salted caramel and pistachio - YUM!\n\nThe next trip to Otto, we ordered the Caprese again, along with the grilled tuna (no more broccoli rabe for us, though). To round out the meal, we ordered the Bucatini all'Amatriciana (tomato, cured pork, onion), which we'd somehow missed on our previous trip - if we had seen it, we would have ordered it from the beginning! Again, the Caprese was sublime, as was the tuna. The bucatini was also amazing, to the point that we needed more bread, then our fingers, to make sure we got every last bit of sauce left on the plate. \n\nOur third trip to Otto, we varied it slightly. We went with the Caprese and the bucatini, but mixed it up by ordering the Marinated Chicken Paillard (arugula, fried eggplant, ricotta). The Paillard was delicious, so simple yet expertly prepared. The eggplant was a nice, thick slab and the creamy ricotta complemented the rest of the dish nicely.\n\nAll in all, the only disappointment was the broccoli rabe, everything else was just wonderful! If the Shoppes at the Palazzo were a bona fide neighborhood, we'd have our favorite neighborhood restaurant right there."

The waiter took back the broccoli & brought the autumn vegetable but they were turnips, parsnip & onions only.  All white veges...boring.  I expected butternut squash, carrots or something else to make it more interesting.  When the check came, I was charged for a full size salad.

I got my meat fix by ordering the bresaola carved to order.  Yum.  And I ordered one of their vegetable pots.

There was a lot of smiling and laughing and joking without anything raucous going on.  \n\nI had two glasses of white wine and left feeling as if this was my favorite dining experience in Las Vegas in quite a while.

Three and a half stars seems right.\n\nWe started with Arancini as an appetizer and it was very good. Arancini is stuffed rice balls, coated with breadcrumbs and then fried. It was crispy on the outside, and the inside was filled with a delicious combination of cheese and jalape\u00f1os.\n\nI ordered the Seafood alla Diavola. This dish had a nice variety of seafood in a spicy tomato-based broth. The seafood was fresh and included mussels, fish, shrimp, and squid. The broth was flavorful, but only spicy in spots (whenever I found a pepper). I thought it was good, but not outstanding.\n\nThe open air (simulated outdoors) restaurant has a lively atmosphere. We were seated at a table adjacent to the walkway. It was very loud at our table because of the pedestrian traffic and music performed in the open space.\n\nThe service was adequate, but our waiter could have been more attentive. The service should be exceptional in a restaurant like this, especially with all the other competition in Vegas.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a good dining experience. A safe choice for casual dining."

The salad was awesome.  I had never had proper balsamic vinegar before - I have just had the grocery store stuff.  The real stuff is really great and I can see why it is so expensive.  \nThe atmosphere is fantastic.  We sat out on an 'indoor patio' where you still had the feel of people walking around and hearing the music, etc. - all while being in climate controlled comfort.\nHonestly - we went to Vegas to try some restaurants but did not want to break the bank either.  This place was spot on IMO.  It was what we would consider a splurge type of place in terms of quality, with only a 'moderate splurge' pricetag."

I ordered a pasta, described as with pecorino and pepper , and this was exactly what I got.  It was disgustingly plain looking,  as it was just narrow, long pasta noodles with pepper, cream,  EXTREME amounts of salt, and the cheese (pecorino) was melted and mixed in.  It was NOT even garnished with any parsley or any greens, it was just plain pasta--no veggies at all.  Presentation was horrible. It was just piled on a very plain plate, not even on an attractive plate.  It tasted like I just threw a box of spaghetti noodles in, mixed some cheese in and threw some pepper on. This place is in a PRIME location at Venetian, so I was definitely surprised at the quality of the food. Mario Batali, your name has forever been tarnished in my mind because your name is on this restaurant. My meal was the most dissatisfying meal I have ever had, and to top it off, I PAID someone to make me this horrible dish, I didn't even make myself the worst meal of my life!!!  It was $17, which I thought to myself (based on the location/looks/chef Mario Batali's name on the restaurant) seemed like a bargain, but I was let down almost instantaneously with one bite. The best part of this visit was probably the packaged breadsticks they give you in the beginning of the meal-- yes, individually packaged breadsticks, which were not even good. \n\nI went in a group of about 7 people, and I tried everyone's dish-- it all tasted the same--but theirs just looked better. I thought maybe I had just picked the bad menu item, but they were all bad!! I think though the worst dish was the \"salad\"--and we were all confused because the \"salad\" included radicchio + mozzarella. It sounded good on the menu--although I am not a fan of radicchio because of the strong bitter taste, I decided to try it. To my surprise there existed a dish even WORSE than my own! It was not a bed of fresh, raw veggies + fresh mozzarella-- it was in fact cooked radicchio mixed with melted mozzarella. It was an epic mess. \n\nSo disappointed by Mario Batali's cuisine. I will NEVER be returning here NOR will I be going to any of his restaurants because clearly this restaurant is ruining his image, and nothing is being done about it. \n\nI will NEVER be returning to this restaurant,"

I like that they don't try to upsell you on items.  Some stand out dishes are the seafood diavola, osso bucco and the margherita pizza. A nice touch is the special pastas and bruchettas they serve daily and those are listed on the back of the main menu.   On Sunday, they had a ricotta bruchetta with pesto and almonds.  I had never had the combination before and it was a wonderful starter.  The pesto was super garlicky which I love and with the housemade ricotta the flavors were strong and balanced.  Desserts here are amazing. Try them all!  I liked the strawberry shortcake best.  Though a year ago, they had a fig or date shake that no one liked but me.

Surprising to me since I manage a fine-dining steakhouse across the street and this price is almost twice what I charge.  The waiter \"warned\" me that this is a deconstructed tiramisu ice cream...it sure was.

I'm a big foodie, and I love Mario Batali's other restaurants. \n\nI'm totally a big fan but this particular restaurant is his lower end, budget type, not so special place. For what it is, and what it's trying to be, it's ok. But if you're in town for a great Italian meal, then do not come here.\n\n- caprese salad: they use cherry tomatoes (which I've never seen done), and instead of fresh basil, there's a pesto mix blended in \nNot your traditional caprese, and not different in a good way. Budget style.\n- prosciutto & arugula pizza: great crust, good sauce & topping ratio, but the prosciutto was extra oily & salty. I've had this before at other restaurants and it doesn't taste this way. Also, the arugula should be generous and crispy/fresh. This wasn't \n- veal lasagne: not enough cheese, or sauce. needs more fresh herbs/spices. It tasted bland and just not delicious. \n\nIt's hard to believe any MB restaurant isn't delicious, but believe it. This is a pass. You're better off a at Olive Garden for the same price."

We had:\n\nRicotta fritte - absolutely amazing. You must get this appetizer if you come here!!!!!!\nArancine fritte - these were ok\nQuattro formaggio pizza - this was ok. The only thing different was that each slice of pizza had a different cheese rather than a blend of cheeses all over the whole thing.\nBalsamic onion pizza - this was their special of the day. It was sooooo good. I've never had a pizza like this. The contrast of the balsamic onions with the ricotta cheese was an awesome combo. \n\nIf you feel like having a little snack, stop by here for the ricotta fritte. My mouth is watering just thinking of them, lol :)"

The waiter took 10 minutes to show up, then was pretentious and rude when we only ordered a small amount.  He then made us feel uncomfortable by sneering at us to the other wait staff after we declined food we did not order, and laughed at us when we didn't order dessert. Tonight we ate at CUT by Wolfgang Puck and cannot stop raving of the service and food.  Otto is not a casual restaurant or inexpensive. If you're looking for something in this price range or a little more, try CUT."

The pizza was a 3.5 star.  The veal and beef meatballs good.  Both pasta dishes were served with way undercooked noodles which were actually crunchy. Who they have cooking I have no idea but nobody is testing.  Food was way to salty.  This restaurant wouldn't survive in most big cities.

The dough was fried perfectly and the fresh grated parmesan was the freshest I have ever tasted. Then ordered the \"Margherita D.O.C\" which was topped with an amazing tomato sauce that was seasoned just right, bufala mozzarella and basil. That pizza alone was breathtaking, but the real winner here was the \"Pesto\" pizza. Thin wood fired crust topped with ricotta, olive oil, and green pesto. When it arrived I admit it looked like the pesto was going to be overpowering and bitter, but boy was I wrong. I have never tasted such a balance of flavors in one bite. The medley of cheese and pesto was perfect. Was disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try the pasta because I'm sure it is amazing as well.\n\nIf you like REAL Italian food, I suggest you try this place."

The meatballs were super dry. Like they were frozen for a long time. The portion was for a kids meal. A joke. I was so sad. Expecting fresh yummy Italian food since this was Mario Batali's joint. I thought they would make fresh pasta! It wasn't that cheap for boxed pasta. The pizza was okay. It needed more sauce. Now the service was terriable. The waiter never came by to ask how things were so we had to flag him down to let him know the pasta was not cooked. They never re-filled our water. I had to flag the bus boy down for water. He spilled water down my leg and food and didn't even say sorry. This place blows. I was disappointed since I really wanted to try Mario's food. Don't eat here. Vegas offers a ton of better places.

A few years ago this place used to be called Enoteca San Marco and I could honestly say that it boasted the best pizza I've ever had. Unfortunately ownership has since changed and although the menu looks almost identical to its earlier version, the quality has dropped a great deal. As things stand now, Enoteca has 2 things going for it: a good location in the middle of the replica of St. Mark's square which means that you will get a chance to see a performance of the \"Phantom\" soundtrack and some Italian opera pieces during dinner and that you won't pay an arm and a leg for a meal. The pizzas are about $18-21 each and are sufficient to keep you satiated and  one can easily feed 2 diners if you add an appetizer or 2. I would say the Prosciutto and Goat Cheese pizza is the best, although the last time I ordered it the pizza came out burnt and overloaded with cheese. Do yourself a favor and don't order the Pesto Pizza; it is supremely disappointing. Finally the wine list is (as expected) dominated by Italian vintages but the staff does not offer much in the way of suggestions if you're having trouble deciding. Their pours of wine are also stingy and the waiter made the mistake of using a wide rimmed glass for champagne. If you're not in the mood for pizza, the restaurant offers a limited selection of meats and pasta which are rather standard Italian fare and which you can get for approximately the same price and superior preparation in the nearby Canaletto and Postrio."

And worse yet was our waiter, rude rude when we wanted it taken off the bill.  Manager not much better, should have comped the whole meal with our total disappointment of the evening...but he did not!  The only shining star was Erika at the bar. Mario..what's up, you need to pay more attention to wait staff and customer service.  This was a BAD Italian experience.\nI'm all Italian, this was bad!"

It offers both outside and inside with a large and nice wine list. We were not in a mood for a big feast but just wanted some fresh and delicate italian food. My friend ordered the pizza and it was very disappointed. Ingredients aren't very fresh and the recipes aren't very exciting. I ordered the pasta with lamb ragu and my other friends got the meat balls. Both dishes were recommended by our waiter. To start with, the portions are extremely small. I am european so I do not except to have a huge plate of pasta but unless you have a massive lunch, you will be hungry after this. This goes against the italian food spirit... The ragu was ok. The lamb was great but it was lacking a lot of flavor. The sauce was very basic tomato sauce which I suspect they use in every dish. My friend got the same sauce in the meat balls. Unfortunately, the meat balls were so small that you couldn't get full flavor of the meat which I think is key.\n\nAnyway, I do not think i will go back there. Too expensive for what it is just because the owner is famous and doesn't deliver on high quality food. I don't mind paying big $$$$ at all when it comes to food but it just has to be top.

As for the atmosphere, it makes the most of the location - on par with all the other indoor patio places in the casinos and better than some.

Most people that dine here are able to sit on the patio so that they can people watch while they enjoy some delicious food.\n\nWe didn't make reservations and were seated inside the wine room.  Only complaint was that it was pretty stuffy inside which I thought was weird considering the amount of wine they had nearby on the shelves.\n\nAs we were browsing the menu, a server brought over the water along with some bread http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#BybPUIq7bTLkopItCcsTXA.  \n\nWe opted to share a few appetizers which included the sweet potato croccheta and the spiedini http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#64U553oYf5iPiEJNBYzcSw.  Both were fried to a dark golden brown and were tasty.  Highly recommend the spiedini as it came out hot and was like eating a gooey cheese melt.\n\nNext appetizer we shared was an assorted vegetable antipasti which comprised of the following marinated olives, eggplant caponata, roasted parsnips, roasted cauliflower, and the otto pickles.  All were tasty but be warned that the pickles have a very very strong vinegar taste to them which people may/may not like.\n\nWe then shared the prosciutto and arugula pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#vreDtfVTfDNJCRA3SZqRGQ.  I cannot tell you how good this pizza was!!  The crust was crispy throughout and combination of prosciutto, mozarella cheese and their sauce was amazing!  This is where the vast majority of pizzerias that serve thin crust pizzas fail as it's soggy in the middle of the pizza.\n\nNext up was the gemelli pasta which consisted of their homemade sausage with broccoli rabe bits http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#6Q7NoNkvAMfRK_jyyFYILA.  The sausage once again did not disaapoint and was simply awesome.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the broccoli rabe and sausage combination was to die for.\n\nBatali did not disappoint once again and I wouldn't hesitate to dine here again when in Vegas."

I spent 15 minutes on Monday night going over the menu with the two women at the reception desk. I was told that they have gluten-free pasta for most dishes and that the homemade sausage is also gluten-free.\n\nFor my Thursday lunch I ordered the gemelli with house sausage and broccoli rabe, made gluten free by substituting GF pasta. The server returned to my table several times to let me know it was taking a long time because they boil a fresh pot of water for all gluten-free orders to prevent cross-contamination.\n\nMy order was not delivered by my waiter, but by someone else. She said it was gemelli without cheese. I said that mine is supposed to be gluten-free and not without cheese. She said that she made a mistake and it was gluten-free and she would bring cheese to my table.\n\nRight after lunch I picked up my luggage and left for the airport, giving myself plenty of time to catch up on work in the Amex Centurion lounge before my 7:00 flight. \n\nAs I was walking to the lounge I felt queasy and knew I was starting to have a major celiac reaction - which I did for the next 3 hours. Anna took very good care of me letting me lie down in the children's room with a cold compress on my head.\n\nAfter talking to the chef and several employees, Paulo determined that there WERE two special orders of gemelli at lunch; one gluten-free and one with no cheese. I got the wrong one and paid the price. He said they are very, VERY careful with food allergies but something went wrong at the last moment - and he is determined to ensure that it doesn't happen again.\n\nOkay, so I will give them another chance when I am next in Vegas. Paulo - thank you so much for your follow up."

Delicious cheese and prosciutto, great subtle lemon flavor.  Very nom.\n\nVegas is pricey but Otto's items were only a couple dollars more than a comparable place in the Bay Area where we're from.

The lunch crowd at I Mulino (at Caesar's Forum Shops) is non-existent, so it's easy to get a table and experience some really good Italian food.\n\nThis place was seriously crowded on a Sunday night in the off season.

The salumi platter offers a nice choice except . . . when you order \"all five of the salumi\" you get two versions of head cheese.  Now we are not sqeamish but we had no idea that two of the five would be head cheese and frankly . . . head cheese tastes like DOG CRAP.  (No, we've not tasted dog crap, but we have a pretty good idea of what it must taste like.)  We gobbled up the other three and nudged the waiter a bit \"Hey, what the heck was that stuff?  Was that head cheese?\"  He says, \"Yep.\"  We said, \"We're not fans of head cheese.  We sure wish you would have told us it was on the platter.\"  He giggles and says, \"Huh, Huh, yeah, not many people like that stuff after they order it.

I have been a fan of his for many years and was left disappointed with my dining experience at B&B. Otto is located in Plaza San Marco and has outside seating which adds to the ambience. Performers in the Plaza\nsing every couple of hours so we were lucky to catch one of the shows. First We ordered the Burrrata and cherry tomatoes which was amazing. The pesto added the perfect balance with the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes. We also ordered the Prosciutto de Parma which was thinly sliced and was a perfect match for the Burrata. Lastly we had the sausage and pepper pizza. The pizza crust was thin and crispy and the contrast of the spicy sausage and the sweet peepers was a great pairing of flavors. Thanks To Otto my faith has now been restored and all is well. This is a great place for a quick lunch or a nice dinner since there are other Italian dishes offered other than pizza."

They were wrong.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, the service was bad, the food was bad, and on the flip side, it was expensive.  By bad food I mean tasteless and overcooked.  My sausage and pepper pizza was a thin, tired looking, dark red sheet of cardboard.  The best part were the crushed red peppers the waiter eventually brought because they had both a nice kick and a nice flavor to them.  \n\nYou don't have the excuse I did.

The decor was nice but a little too formal for a bistro.  The Margherita pizza was evcellent, better than what we had in Rome.  The gemelli pasta with brocolli rabe and housemade sausage was really flavorful but the pasta itself was too al dente for us.  We thought they should have offered to shave some fresh parmesan on the pasta dish but they didn't.  The appetizer fritti arancine (fried rissoto) was excellent; the fritti di Prosciutto was not as good.  Pistachio and dark chocolate malt gelato was as good as it gets; really smooth, rich and flavorful.  We found the wine by the glass and by the ounce way too pricey; a 4 ounce glass of their middle of the road white and red cost as much as our entres."

            "review": "I will fully acknowledge that being from California (born in So Cal, now living in Nor Cal), I am a food critic without a doubt.  I also understand that Vegas restaurants that are play offs of their main establishments are meant to cater to a broader variety of people that often come at the sacrifice of quality and variety.  In any case, however, what I'm trying to get at is, it'll be good, but there aren't too many places that I seem think are great.  Such is the case with Otto Enoteca.  Greg and I stopped off here after wandering around the Venetian and trying to find a place that was moderately priced for a Linner (Lunch + Dinner).  Greg had just visited Mario Batali's place in LA, so naturally he thought to try here just out of curiosity.  We both decided against pizza since that usually gets taken care of past midnight in Vegas, so we went with two pasta dishes: Bucatini all'Amatriciana and Gemelli.  Leading up to this, we ordered two drinks, a Bellini and a beer while waiting for our food.  Our waitress was nice and very courteous, but what I didn't understand was the table bread situation.  After we requested the bread, it came out in a basket...and that was it.  No butter, no olive oil, no salt and pepper on the table, just bread.  Um, ok?  We were starved, but they certainly didn't put much effort into presentation.  The bread itself was delicious, but it probably would have been better with something else.  Anyway, the mains came out, and the waitress had warned us that they serve the pasta al dente.  No kidding, as it would seem.  I typically don't like al dente but was willing to try it.  My dish, the Bucatini, had great flavor to it with a spicy tomato sauce, onions, and some cured  pork.  My only issue was, much like the bread, it was literally just pasta on a plate.  No additional decorations, no detail to presentation, just pasta on a plate.  The plate itself wasn't that big, but I wasn't going to complain about the portion.  Anyway, Greg's plate was also good, and he was convinced that his plate was better than mine.  I had one bite (the maximum bites I was allocated) and it was tasty.  Anyway, after the meal was over, we sat around and people watched which I would say is valuable since there's a million things going on in that little plaza.  Ultimately, I'd say this place is a little pricey considering the fact that a) it was just pasta, b) absolutely nothing special done for the dishes, and c) I think like most places in Vegas, the restaurant can hike the prices up since people like myself will pay for it.  I might come back here next time if I feel like pasta, but for $35/person, I'll see if I can go somewhere else."

Plus, since it was a Mario Batali restaurant, we wanted to see how it compared to Carnevino and B&B Ristorante.  \n\nThe bartender who served us at the bar was knowledgeable and attentive.  He was also very friendly.  My wife chose one of his cheese selections to add to her Prosciutto Di Parma plate and she was pleased with it.  We thought it was a bit ridiculous that they ask you if you want a side of Pomodoro sauce and then ding you $7 for it but it's Vegas and even an extra napkin will probably cost $1.  We are used to it.\n\nThe wine he suggested was not her favorite but she wanted to try a Pinot Grigio that was a bit different.  I ordered one of my favorite white wines:  Bastianich Vespa Bianco so I was very pleased since it is not easy to find.  Mario Batali restaurants seem to carry it in Las Vegas however because I last had it at his B&B Ristorante.\n\nThe atmosphere and the experience would most likely be enough for us to return in the future."

I read some of the reviews commenting on the pizza not being good and I completely disagree. I was in Italy last summer for three weeks and the food at Otto's is as close to true authentic Italian cuisine as I have found in the U.S.A. The problem is that most Americans eat Americanized Italian food not true Italian food.  In italy chicken comes on the side and never smothered in cheese or sauce. I love the bellini's at Otto's. For people who have never tried a Bellini, it is the national drink of Venice. I also love the pizza at Otto's, it is light and flavorful just like Italy. American pizza is smothered with cheese, not Italian pizza. It's too hot in Italy to eat heavy meals. On saturdays they make homemade lasagna which is light and delicious, one of my all time favorite dishes at Otto's.  Make sure to leave room for the gelato which is also very authentic to Italy. Real Italian gelato should be light and airy and bursting with flavor and that's exactly what you get at Otto's. If your looking for authentic Italian cuisine then Otto's is the place to go, but if you want crappy Americanized Italian then try olive garden."

The waitress was a snob and used hard sell tactics.  She made outragious claims about the food.  She told us \"everything\" was organic.  Not likely.  She went on to say how the quality of everything was so special that none of us would have every had anything that good.  I have been in the food business for years and was insulted by her implication that we were country bumpkins. When we didn't order the dessert she told us not to get any from the adjascent vendor, cause it had artificial colors and flavors.  WTF.  When she couldn't sell us \"everything\" she abruptly left and pretty much ignored us for most of the time we were there.\n\n2, There were 6 of us.  (2) couples EACH shared a salad and one entree. The other couple each had a entree, no salad.  No one had dessert and only one person had a drink (a coke).  The bill was 180.00  I could stop here but.........\n\n3. When my husband and I asked for the dressing for the octopus salad to be on the side, she pretty much rebuked us and said it was the best lemon vinaigrette we had ever tasted and we must have it on the salad.  Ok, we did.  Never even tasted it.  The salad was $14.00 and had a couple of pieces of octopus and a couple of pieces of potato.  It was ordinary.\n\n4. My husband and I ordered the Grimalini.  It was so undercooked that I could not eat it.  The waitress overheard me say this and after commenting that I didn't understand what al dente was took it back.  When it finally came back, it was almost the same as it had been.  There was about (3) tablespoons of overcooked dried out sausage and some rapini (not bad).  I did not eat it at all. The bread was aweful and my husband had to ask for oil. \n\n5. My husband's uncle ordered the meat balls and spaghetti.  It was the smallest portion I have ever seen for an entree.  There was a handful of marble sized meat balls???? I can only imagine what they tasted like.\n\n6.  The others didn't complain about their meals.\n\n7. While waiting to go to the ladies room I could see into the kitchen.  There was a large tub of chicken sitting out unrefrigerated.  It was there when we came in and it was there when we left.  Someone call the health department.\n\nMario Batteli YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING.  Take a look at your restaurant.  If this is the best you can do................"

When we were there, some opera singers and performers were doing their thing on the square, and they actually were great! I had a salad, nicely proportioned, with escarole, pears, walnuts and pecorino. The pears were browned around the edges from age, meaning they'd been sliced awhile previously. It's little things such as this that made me realize this is just an overpriced touristy place. In Las Vegas! Who would have thought! Since this is a pizza place I should have gone with that but just wanted something light. Service was a tad snooty but adequate. I wasn't expecting anything special and got exactly that.

            "review": "I like to judge Italian restaurants on their margherita pizzas and spaghetti with tomato sauce.  Both of these dishes are very simple, but if done right, can be amazing.  Based upon the server mentioning how small the dishes are, we ordered both, along with a sausage and peppers pizza, and a cheese plate.  The portions were not as small as the waiter said or what other reviewers have mentioned, and we are not exactly lightweights.  \n\nWe started with a cheese plate of bufala mozzarella, taleggio, and Cypress Grove goat cheese.  The plate was served with bread, cherries, apricot, and most importantly, honey with black truffle.  All three cheeses were great, and I loved the honey with black truffles.\n\nThe margherita pizza was very good.  What really made it stand out was how crispy the crust was.  Many pizzas tend to get soggy over time, as the sauce seeps into the crust, but this remained crispy until the end.  The sauce had a nice fresh tomato flavor.  The cheese was good, though I wish it had more of it.  It was not the best margherita I have had, but I would definitely order it again.\n\nThe spaghetti and meatballs were good but over salted.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  The sauce would have been better with about 1/3 less salt.  The meatballs had nice flavor and added a little kick to the dish.  I was hoping the dish would be in the same class as spaghetti at Scarpetta, but it most certainly was not.\n\nThe service was great.\n\nOverall, I would eat there again, though I am not particularly anxious to do so."

The second thing I really liked was my burrata caprese. Absolutely tasty. You know that scene in the movie Ratatouille, where Anton Ego the Critic is transported, with one bite, back to his childhood home in rural France? I had a moment like that, back to a sunny cafe in Italy. I had a pasta, the carbonara special, which was nice but somewhat heavy. I regretted ordering it, despite having had a hankering for carbonara which had actually led me to choosing the restaurant, because it was just too much. A light series of sorbetti helped me recover, and of course, the finishing off of the wine. Mmm."

The pizza was unbelievable.  It was around $15 or so for a personal size (we shared, it was a snack) and was perfect.\n\nThis restaurant is perfect where it counts, execution and quality of ingredients.

The bottom crust was crunchy with a wonderfully chewy end crust.  \n\nWe also tried some of the appetizers:   Cauliflower Frittelle  and  Frittelle di Prosciutto.   Frittelle di Prosciutto was good but very salty.   Cauliflower Frittelle  was also very good, but the portion size was large and we had to stop ourselves from over eating.\n\nService was a little slow, especially for being lunchtime on a weekday.  However, we would go back because the pizza was just that good!"

Two of us shared appetizer portions of brussel sprouts and gnocci fritters.  The sprouts were absolutely delicious, and were quickly consumed.  The gnocci fritters were frankly weird, and reminded us of ballpark fare.  After the appetizers, we had two salads.  My wife had a mixed green salad with balsamic vinegar and prosciotto.  I had the octopus salad with celery and potatoes.  Both were excellent.  \n\nOn a later occassion, and needing a quick meal, we revisited Otto for lunch.  This time, it was only a 3.5 star experience.  Service was adequate, and the food was fine, but lacked flavor.  We each had a salad (good) and shared a clam pizza.  I am a fan of seafood pizzas because they provide so much flavor... not this one.  It was undercooked and bland, regrettably.\n\nOverall, this is probably a 4-star restaurant.  I hope that your experience more resembles my first time rather than my second time."

            "review": "A harrowing experience that I have never forgotten \n\nOn December the 27th, 2010, my family and I decided to eat at this establishment, a quaint and attractive corral of tables inside the Venitian. Thinking that pizza was universal enough and since I love cheese, I ordered the pizza quatro fromaggi. It should be called the \"pizza quatro dimone.\" \n\nWhile my fellow diners were privileged to partake in good and tasteful victuals, my experience was horrifically different. The \"pizza\" arrived, a thin yet textureless crust more bland than a saltine cracker. Oh, what I would have given for the remainder of that meal to have been so bland! \n\nThe sauce was somehow simultaneously as bitter as orange juice served in an aluminum cup and as sweet as frosting, smothered atop the pizza in a bloody masacre-like fashion. The surface of the pizza would have been only sauce, but for one horrific, greasy, formless globule of cheese in the center of each piece. I'll never know if it was the Tallegio or the Cacio that fell me.  \n\nAnd here, I start to go blank. The memories, the horror... \nThe taste of bile and frosting mixed with locker-room sweat and sourness, mixed with the at once rosey yet musky dirty-water \"Esscence of the Venitian\" scent wafting through the air ducts. I could taste nothing but that for days. Every food I ate for the rest of the day tasted of IT. \n\nNow I sit here, more than two years later, still remembering every once in a while that terrible taste, that permiating aroma. I can still smell it on-call, just by remembering. \n\nShame on you, Mario Batalli. In all of your culinary genious, you have hidden ONE fateful dish on your menu, making for a cruel game of russian roulette. \n\nAlthough you may partake of its benignant friends, BEWARE of this pizza and the evil it portends!"

Chad was not only a great server, he guided our food orders as to not order astray.\n\nWe started with Mozzarella and Anchovy in Carrozza (a fried anchovy and mozzarella sandwich served with a fennel salad), 3 cheese plate consisting of burrata, buffalo mozzarella and goat cheese.  The cheeses were served with black truffle honey, macerated apricots and cherries.  Wow!  The cheeses and accompaniments were amazing.  The sandwich was good and quite rich.\n\nWe decided to go with pizza as our main course.  I chose pacetta and goat cheese and my wife ordered the pepperoni.  The pizzas were good.  Mine was on the salty side and mellowed out by the slightly sweet sauce and the richness of the goat cheese.  My wife's was basically an upscale pepperoni pizza.  We opted to pass on dessert.\n\nSo how does this deserve 4 stars?  It was upon our return the next evening.  We asked to be seated with Chad and he delivered once again.  We started out with the same cheese plate as before.  Equally delicious.  I opted to go for the Vongole pizza (olive oil sauce, mozzarella, clams and chili).  The pizza came to the table with the clams still in the shells.  The pizza was rich and creamy without being overload.  My wife ordered the Gemelli pasta (house sausage and broccoli rabe).  The pasta had a nice bite from the rabe.  We passed on dessert this evening as well.\n\nOtto had consistent solid food with great service.  I will be back on my next trip to Vegas."

            "review": "This was our third and final dinner on a recent trip to Vegas. After exquisite meals at Yellowtail and Scarpetta, we were ready to be impressed (in a more casual setting) by Mario Batali's joint. \n\nFinding the place was our first hassle. The Venetian could use some updated signage. Finally someone told us to \"bear left at the canal\" and we were on our way. We arrived in a quintessentially Vegas setting: a pseudo piazza with a few designer shops and restaurants. After two meals overlooking the Bellagio fountains, this was totally mediocre. We took our \"outdoor\" seats and reviewed the menu.\n\nOnce we picked our food, we placed our orders in one of the most irritating interactions with a waiter I've ever had. When I ordered the arugula salad to start, he said to me, \"Do you know that arugula is bitter... are you sure you want it?\" Wtf? I guess we were in Vegas where folks from all walks of life, including those that never encounter arugula, eat out. I guess he was trying to be helpful. Mostly I was insulted by having to explain that I do in fact know what arugula is and do in fact want to eat it.\n\nThen I ordered the gnoccho fritto as part of our fried appetizer. Again, the waiter explains what it is as though it's definitely not what I have in mind and possibly won't like it. I don't care what it is. I want to try it.\n\nThen I ordered the gemelli for myself with their housemade sausage and broccoli rabe. AGAIN, \"Do you know what broccoli rabe is? A lot of people don't know.\" Yep, I know what broccoli rabe is. Thanks! \n\nYadda yadda, other than the above mentioned experiences, the food was pretty solid. We asked for the bread and received it half way through our entrees (and no olive oil to speak of, though I guess we should have been more clear about that). The fried stuff was fried stuff. It should have come with more sauces for dippin'. The arugula salad was tasty, but there was nothing particularly special about it. The girl who brought our wine commented, \"I love that salad. It's so... simple.\" Indeed.\n\nMy pasta was delicious. I scarfed down the whole plate, which was impressive given the massive amounts of fried food I'd just had. The housemade sausage was spot on, and the broccoli rabe was plentiful and well-prepared. My sister had the pesto pizza and loved it, though I thought it was a bit too rich and couldn't imagine eating much of it. My mom had the bucatini and loved it, as well. \n\nIf you find yourself near this place, give it a try. But don't go out of your way. They have some work to do in the service department, and maybe they should just write out explanations on the menu if customers are frequently confused about arugula and broccoli rabe. I say spend a little more and do Scarpetta instead if you have time to plan."

We ordered the Prosciutto Arugula pizza. Had it been decent, we would have ordered the Margherita too. This came with 6 very thin small slices. I like thin crust and the dough was not bad, but it was burned on the bottom. The pizza itself only had 3 toppings: almost no cheese, prosciutto, almost no arugula (literally 3 tiny pieces on the whole pizza) and super tangy tomato sauce. The problem wasn't the lack of variety of toppings. Some of the best tasting pizza I've ever had had few toppings. But there needs to be enough of those very toppings. Anyway, the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a can, but if it was made there which I assume it was, that shows theirs taste even worse than Prego or Ragu, yuck. The little cheese that was there (not even certain there was cheese amongst the strong sour tomato sauce) & meat slid off the entire pizza along with the tomato sauce. I was constantly putting the meat back on. For this dinky little awful tasting \"pizza\" we paid $20, was it even 12 inches? The bartender was really pushing us to get a 2nd one being it's small. After that experience, no thank you.  The 2nd star is only because the atmosphere there is so nice, it's in the Venitian after all. Violinists were playing behind us, of course little of the good part of the setting had anything to do with the restaurant itself, but rather the lovely Italian inspired hotel. If that pizza is a representation of the quality of their entire menu, then I don't think they deserve that amazing space."

We arrived a bit earlier than our 5 o'clock reservation and I didn't see my awesome waiter from last time, Jeffrey, so I didn't bother to ask to be in his section.  That sadly was an error.  He did show up right around 5 but it was too late by then.  The waiter I got assigned wasn't nearly so attentive (he actually disappeared partway through our meal) and to be honest, much as I hate to say it, I could barely understand his accent so I didn't ask as many questions about the menu as the first time.\n\nWe ordered five cheeses - the three I had last time plus gorgonzola and parmesano reggiano.  I love blue cheeses but the gorgonzola was actually a bit too strong for me, which I found really surprising.  My favorites this time were the aged goat cheese and the parmesan.  I still love the cherries that come with that dish.\n\nFor entrees my honey ordered the lasagna and I ordered the sausage and peppers pizza.  I had a bite of his lasagna and thought it was very good.  The pizza alas was just mediocre.  The sausage didn't have much flavor and it was sparse on cheese, though the cheese was good quality, and to be frank I didn't find the sauce very flavorful.  I preferred the goat cheese pancetta pizza from last time, which was different enough from a 'normal' pizza that I wouldn't compare the two directly.\n\nFor dessert we tried the cherry shortcake which was pretty good.  The cherries were sadly not the same ones as on the cheese plate which is what we were hoping for, but were more like queen anne cherries.  It was still a decent dessert but didn't hold a candle to the amazing pear sorbetto from last time which alas was not offered on this visit.\n\nI still like the restaurant overall but I'm feeling like it's very hit or miss, with some potential for greatness that isn't always realized."

The apps were okay - certainly not bad - but nothing special.  (also some drinks and wine which were just fine)\n\nThen we had two pizzas.  The Margarita DOC pizza and the Pancetta/Goat cheese pizza.  The Margarita DOC was truly disgusting.  The thin crust was tasteless and soggy.  The tomato sauce was as if someone had taken campbell's cream of tomato and slapped in on cardboard.  Then there was a dab of mozzarella.  Overall a tasteless, soggy, bizarre tasting mess.  C'mon Mario - please don't tell me you actually think this is good?   The other pancetta/goat cheese pizza had a little more flavor but still mediocre at best.  (btw: note to restaurant - those breadstick packets you put on the table are old/expired/have a funky chemical aftertaste).\n\nThe setting in St. Mark's square \"a la Venice\" is charming and romantic.  Really a lovely setting - and reminds me of my trip there many years ago.  The service is\neager, but weirdly clumsy - like they  are trying too hard to let you know that this is a serious dining experience - overly explaining every little thing - and educating you on every ingredient if you ask a question about the menu - which is nice but just too much.  They also push certain dishes or desserts - but they go on forever when you really just want to cut them off and let them know you hate Pumpkin so no need to do five minutes on the\" deconstructed pumpkin cheesecake in a jar\".  Just sayin....   Somehow - we spent close to $200 on this meal - a lot given what it was.\n\nI had read the mixed reviews on yelp - including one that mentioned the Campbell's tomato soup tasting pizza - but I figured they were probably just being bitchy - and the location worked for us as we were going to see a show at the Venetian.  But the mixed reviews are accurate - and we will not be returning to Otto anytime soon.  Mario - still a fan - Joe, still not a fan."

It most definitely did not disappoint.  \n\nService:  Fantastic.  As a solo dinner, they didn't offer to seat me at the bar or give me the pity look.  And since this was the \"getting over the guy\" trip, this was super helpful.  \n\nFood:  I ordered the Caprese, the Bucatini with cured pork and onions, and for dessert, the Dark Chocolate.  All three dishes were absolutely delicious.  It's been a few days and I want that meal again, like right now.  \n\nSince its in that square area of the Venetian, the atmosphere was really cool.  Needless to say, I was extremely impressed.  I walked out with a full belly and a smile!  Thank you, OTTO!"

In all honesty I like the place a lot.  What I liked most about it is that they have a very good selection of Italian cheese.  Which I love and they have Broccli Rabe which I love more.\n\nSat at the bar by myself after a god awful day at the trade show.  Had a nice glass of wine which they sell by the ounce. I thought I was back in high school buying  pot but the selection was great and while worth it.\n\nThe staff at the bar was atentive but not the best.

Now..although this restaurant felt a teensy bit like a chain restaurant (must have been the look and feel of the menus and the paper-wrapped breadstick appetizers), I still enjoyed it immensely. Just make sure you can find it on your own accord since not one staff member we asked at the Venetian knew where it was. Strange.\n\nWe started the night off with the squash fritti, which was basically a french fry in squash form. I am a fan of anything fried, so you can't really go wrong here. The fritti were perfectly crispy--also a plus in my book.\n\nI ordered the braised pork shoulder, which I was told by two servers was the best thing on the menu. It was melt in your mouth delicious! This is a no nonsense dish for those who like meat. Very few frills...just some vegetables sprinkled on top and some balsamic around the plate. Both complimented this dish very well. That's really all an avid meat-lover like me can ask for!\n\nMy friend who dined with me is admittedly not adventurous when it comes to food, so she stuck with the spaghetti and meatballs. I got one bite of a meatball, which I could barely pry away from her on account of her loving it so much. Hard for me to tell much about it in one bite, but it seemed like a very standard meatball.\n\nWe finished off the meal with a dark chocolate cake, dark chocolate gelato, graham cracker gelato and meringue all tucked into a martini shaped glass. Very yummy, and also a recommendation from our fabulous server from Turin (so sorry I failed to get his name!). \n\nService was fabulous, and all servers within a 10 table radius were attentive and helpful, regardless of whether you were their responsibility or not. Last but not least, I have to mention the music selection. Since Mario had been dinged for his music choice at Babbo before, I must commend his Black Crowes song flowing from the speakers inside. A little \"Sister Luck\" never hurt anyone before."

I should have asked but his pizza at Eataly is Napolitana, so I assumed. Mistake. He charges $18 in Las Vegas & $14 in Manhattan.  I won't go back to Otto."

Mario Batali may have his name all over this restaurant but if he only knew the crappy service provided by their staff I don't think he would be too happy.  I am an honest diner with a world trained palate and this place, in my views, is just average.  Pizza isn't really worth trying.  New York's Lombardi's and Grimaldi's step all over this place, even a little known place called Adrienne's located in New York's Stone Street can beat their so called \"prosciutto and arugula\" pizza the waiter spoke so highly of.  How is it that a simple task of taking orders becomes such a complicated matter?  Waiter is assigned a table that has a number on the dining floor layout for ease of service.  Waiter comes to table, waiter enumerates diners, waiter writes orders in chronological order, runner delivers orders in the same order within reasonable waiting time.  Basic right?  Not at Otto's.  The runner is going around four or five tables asking if someone ordered the cauliflower fritters.  He even delivered the first batch to the wrong table, who had just placed the same order literally 45 seconds prior to delivery by runner.  They must think the service there is so excellent because their order only took 45 seconds.  We had to wait 25 minutes for our fritters.  A waiter nor runner should ask who ordered a specific dish at a table with multiple diners.  Flavor wise this place has a lot to ask for.  I can only salvage the Gemelli with home made sausage and broccoli rabe.  It may just be the only thing they got right at this place.  Prices are outrageously high for this type of food.  All in all the place can be a lot better. And for their prices you should expect that much high standard of service and attention.  Not the concept here.  The concept is: Otto's is a celebrity chef's restaurant therefore prices should be high without regards for service and ambiance.  Dining should be a memorable experience with food you can't cook at home.  Not at Otto's."

I was in Venice last month, and it is a very modern smaller version of San Marco Square, non-the-less it was a perfect spot for the restaurant of the infamous Mario Batali. \nThis will always be memorable, because my parents are locals of Vegas, so they were meeting us here for lunch.  Meeting my BF for the very first time, so yes I was nervous. So he ordered a bottle of red wine knowing that a glass would help me. \nI have to say, that I was never a big fan of Italian food and perhaps I take that after my father.  So I was a little apprehensive that my dad would not enjoy his lunch with us. Fortunately everything we ordered was a hit.  We started w/ arugula salad... my favorite. But you can't go wrong with that, it's pretty simple. We also shared  a margharita pizza as an appetizer.  I love that it's thin crust. It was delicious. Both my dad and BF ordered the steak. My mother had the lasagne, and I ordered the grilled succulent pork chop.  We all shared a bite of everyone's main entree, and they were all incredibly yummy!  Our desert was sundae of 4 different gelati. coffee, pistachio, caramel, and chocolate.  Sinfully good! Our friendly waiter was very patient and attentive.  And best part was my parents enjoyed their lunch and getting to know my bf. It was sort of preliminary rendevous to get a taste of where my parents were off to... they were getting ready to leave for Europe... They are about to spend the entire summer in Italy... primarily Venice. So how cool was that?"

There aren't words to describe it. It was juicy, flavorful, and tender. I've had a lot of pork that was dry and overcooked, but this one was complete perfection! Sure, the service was a little slow, but it was very crowded, and once I had a bite of that pork shoulder, all my annoyance at the wait vanished!

The Venetian is so pretty, I love walking through it along the canals with gondolas. \n\nI have been to both locations of Otto, Las Vegas, and New York City. The menus are pretty similar, but i find the wine list is better in NYC. I am a fan of this really obscure Italian wine, and the NYC location has it, LV doesn't. But don't let my snobbery cloud a really good wine list in LV.\n\nYou can order 2 different sizes of salads, which i like. Had the arugula and parmesan which was very tasty!\n\nThe pizza's here are fantastic. Had the house-made sausage and peppers pizza which was cooked perfectly. The sausage has a bit of heat to it, and the thin crust is awesomely cooked.\n\nOtto is a great way in Vegas (and NYC) for great food and great prices!"

Then for my main course, as I am enjoying my tuna steak I notice a small black hair on my plate.  It was clearly not my own, and I showed the waiter who took it away.  While he offered to get me something else, my appetite was lost at this point. It is a shame since the wine was great and my bf was happy with his food, but the overall quality of service is just not acceptable, especially for a chef who I greatly admire.

We made a reservation ahead of time and there was no wait.\n\nWe ordered a plate of Gorgonzola, the fried cauliflower and fried ricotta balls as an appetizer, then two types of pizza and the veal and ricotta meatballs, and a very nice and reasonably priced bottle of Chianti and cannoli. \n\nThe Gorgonzola was tasty and was served with honey, cherries and apricots, which was nice. The fried cauliflower was GREAT - unique texture and delicious flavor. The ricotta balls were like a fancy jalapeno popper and were tasty too. \n\nI really loved our pizza margarita - I love buffalo mozzarella and the sauce was flavorful enough to balance it - and my friend's four cheese pizza was good (except there was way too much ricotta on the ricotta slices). We shared an order of the meatballs, and were so happy that we did. The meatballs were moist and flavorful. I wish the polenta had been less \"grit\" style, and that there had been more of it - there was MAYBE a couple tablespoons and we were expecting a little more, but it was good.\n\nAnd the canolli was delicious - three small canolli with creamy filling that wasn't overly sweet. It was just sweet enough that you weren't overwhelmed, but not saccharine-y.\n\nThe reason they don't get more stars - I wish some of the portions were larger - I get that Vegas is super expensive AND this is the restaurant of a famous chef, but other places in Vegas have a better cost/portion ratio. \n\nAlso, the pizza was delicious but the crust was just a TINY bit overcooked for my taste. I like a pizza that has a firm but slightly chewy crust, and the crust here was too crispy all the way through. And the bread they give you was kind of flavorless and dry - good for the cheese my friend put on it but otherwise kind of bland. \n\nI'd like to go back and try out some other menu items but it'll have to be the next time I'm ready to splurge!"

The service was good but the food wasn't worth the price. I had a $25 truffle pizza with only a slight hint of truffle (probably from an oil). It just wasn't worth it!  I expected more from Mario (Eately was much better)."

            "review": "Above average for a casino restaurant.\n\nWe were fortunate to snag a table for dinner right along the rail in the \"courtyard\" meaning that we enjoyed the string quartet that was playing as well as the incomparable people watching that Vegas casinos offer. If you were with a significant other, it would be pretty romantic - all the atmosphere of St Mark's Square in Venice without the worry of being shit on by hordes of pigeons. As it was, I was here for work and had to confine myself to enjoying the fashion choices of the tourist hordes.\n\nWine - well, an enoteca generally means \"wine bar\" where the choices are many and the price is reasonable. This is Vegas - the choices are many, but the prices are mighty. That said, I did have the best prosecco I can recall (bone dry) for a relatively reasonable $12/glass.\n\nFood - I had a hard time choosing between pizza and meatballs. But at the end of the day, who doesn't want to sample Mario Batali's balls, amirite? All ball jokes aside, my meal was really good - if meatballs could ever be described as \"light\", these were. I liked that they were served with polenta rather than pasta. And the serving was generous - 3 large meatballs. Personally, I can only handle two balls at a time. (sorry, couldn't resist)\n\nSide - Cold peas with prosciutto & mint - absolutely delightful.\n\nService - slightly above average. We didn't see her a lot but no real issues either.\n\nTwo further questions:\n\nDoes \"Otto\" mean something in Italian? Otherwise, it kind of seems odd to name a restaurant after the bus driver on the Simpsons.\n\nThis place is located across the piazza from a Wolfgang Puck joint. Do the servers here fight it out after hours a la the Sharks and the Jets? Because that would be pretty awesome."

You'd think you'd be getting superb service but no, our waiter didn't even greet us when he got to our table. He just said \"you ready to order?\" And throughout our dining, we barely saw him like once. But asides the crappy service, the food was great and there was an opera performer outside and we loved that!"

Never had anything like that before and was honestly a little wary of trying it, but I'm so glad we did!"

We also ordered pasta dish - the Bucatini - rich and with a bit of bite - lovely.  Prices were reasonable and mid-range - will visit this place again if I'm in Vegas."

There were 2 or 3 women, neither could be bothered to greet us properly and we sat very near to their little podium, so we got to hear their copious complaints about how busy it was. Ladies, busy is good. busy means you have a job! Yay for busy. Also, no patron wants to hear you complain. It ruins my ability to pretend I'm at a sidewalk cafe in Venice. \n\nHere's the 5 star thing- The perserved tuna bruschetta. That was a work of art. \n\nIf you're hungry and nearby and they aren't too busy, eat here. Don't seek this place out, though."

My gf had a plate of linguini and mussel and saffron, she liked it ok. The busboy was really nice and friendly. Ambiance is good. The wine glass starts at 11 but raise quickly to 40$+, only 3 choices below 20$ a glass! Vegas I guess.."

            "review": "I can't give half stars...but if I could...I would give this place a 2.5. I would have to say the service was very good. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu and suggested some good appetizers and entrees, well at least he made it seem like they were good. There were 9 in our party. We ordered a cheese platter with some nice condiments like apricot marmalade, cherries and honey that went amazingly well with the ricotta cheese. I don't remember what other cheeses we ordered, I think there were like 8 different kinds on there. They were cheeses that you could buy at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods or even possibly at an Italian Deli, which I'm sure would be way better. That platter alone was about $30 and we ordered 2 different pizzas....might I say I had better. I would prefer a Pizza from Pizzamania in Long Beach, Ca. over the pizza from Otto.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had a Grilled Pork Chop for our entree, the server suggested for the pork to be cooked medium rare...but when we got it it was well done and dry. I'm just glad there were juices from the pork that I could dip my meat in. I didn't want to send it back because we've waited long enough for our food. All the other pastas that everyone else in our party ordered looked like below avg pastas. I've had waaaay better pasta cooked by yours truly. Like any other restaurant in Las Vegas, everything was over priced for the way it tasted. It wasn't anything special. It's not a place that I would recommend to others. I never like Mario Batali that Orange Croc wearing chef...he seems to be way to over arrogant for the menu at Otto. I don't think I would go there again. Just Sayin!!!"

The service is ok, but really lacks the polish and finesse you'd expect at a B&B restaurant. Pizzas are great, as always. Cheeses are great too. I go here any time I'm at the Palazzo for a glass of wine and cheese. Save your \"meals\" for elsewhere. Carnevino, for example."

Yes, it is not Babbo (my favourite MB and JB restaurant) but you don't have to call a month in advance for over an hour hoping to get a reservation, and it is a completely different experience. \n\nThe appetizers and pizza are amazing, the pasta is superb and the desserts are to die for.

The ambiance is that faux Venetian vibe with the artificial sky above you and the feeling of being in Venice, which I have indeed visited and I wasn't teleported back in time by the surroundings.\nThere was live music playing on the courtyard stage which was very pleasant.\n\nWe were given three small pieces of bread or as Al Bundy would have called them \"toaster leave'ems\". We asked for olive oil which helped. I was ravenous by this point because it took a good ten minutes to read over the extensive wine and cocktails list. \n\nMy quattro formaggio pizza was meh.  It tasted like those Kashi pizzas sans the fiber aspect that makes it tolerable because it's good FOR you. There were no spices used in the sauce at all. However the cheeses were delicious. I enjoyed my (yes, you read it right MY) bottle of Prosecco Flur. It was not too sweet and a nice bubbly to accompany the \"meal\". The saving grace of the evening was their dessert--their dark chocolate cake with whipped salted caramel, toasted vanilla meringue, and dark chocolate malt gelato was utterly sinful. Thank goodness for that dessert! Would I return? Only for that dessert and Prosecco!"

It was topped by a light cheese (I'm sorry I don't know exactly what kind cheese it was but it tasted like provolone) and some chives to cut the richness of the dish. \n\nFor my main, I ordered the chicken paillard. The dish had many layers, starting with a slice of fried eggplant for crunch and bitterness. On it, they spread ricotta to add a creamy texture to the dish. They then added a layer of tomatoes followed by two layers of grilled chicken. The charred edges of the chicken added the perfect amount of smokiness to offset the ricotta. For a little bite and a little acid, they placed arugula that was dressed in a vinaigrette.  A little olive oil finished the dish.  It's a beautiful dish and worth a try. \n\nFor dessert, I had a pumpkin cheesecake. It's an interesting dish, composed of both crispy pumpkin chips (tastes similar to sweet potato chips) and thicker slices either boiled or grilled. Underneath was mascarpone (the cheese in the \"cheesecake\") nuts and graham cracker to mimic the flavours of a cheesecake. It was an interesting dessert but definitely not a sweet finish. If you want something sweet, then go for something else, like the gelato that they make in-house. \n\nThe only not so nice thing is the lighting - it's a bit too dark for my taste. \n\nTip: Daily specials are great - check the back of the menu. \nTip: If you're the designated driver of the night, ask about their sodas; they also make them fresh in-house."
