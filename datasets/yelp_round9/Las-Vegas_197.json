            "review": "We have ordered delivery several times via EAT24 and it is ridiculously fast!!!! Fresh, hot, and fast! \n\nOur favs are Pad Thai (no egg), Pad Kee Mao, and yellow curry. The crispy vegetable spring rolls we have also ordered before and they were yummy. Hot and crispy. \n\nThe yellow potato curry is one of the best I have ever had. I love the way they cut the potatoes...big. \nIt comes with steamed or brown rice. I love having the brown rice option! \n\nPad Thai here is large and flavorful. We ask for no eggs and it comes with a large pile of sprouts and I love the ground peanuts and slice fresh lime.\n\nThe Pad Kee Mao (I get it medium and wow it's pretty spicy) is full of yummy Thai basil and big fresh flat noodles. \n\nThe portions are big here and the prices are on target. \n\nWe are fans of Komol but for different reasons. My husband said Weera's food is better...but I like Komol more because of their herbal salad. \n\nNo mock meats here at Weera, just fresh Thai with the option of tofu. We get the extra veggie option instead of tofu."

They have a 10% facebook check-in.\n- Free thai tea ad? haha. you pay 3.50 for the thai tea, then you get unlimited refills. \n- Lots of egg with pad see ew! Loved it. \n- Kale too hard. cook it more.\n- Small portions. For 10, not a deal. Good thing there's the groupon. \n- Green curry was great! eggplants were soft and delicious. right mix of coconut milk for the curry. medium is a perfect blend. \n- Small portion of rice. Just one scoop. \n- total came out to 19.58 but the remaining credit from the 20 is voided. \n- Great place for a coupon, but to come without one, I'd reconsider."

It is good, it is not insane good and I'm still morning the loss of now closed Thai BBQ's Tiger's cry and crispy spicy catfish, but it is totally solid and perfect for lunch. The waitresses are always cool. All the curries are great. It is family friendly, but kind of boring. I'm glad they got rid of the old fake fishing rod decoration (which I now miss) but the new decor is not making me feel so homey and comfortable- its kind of sterile, but whatever, great food. its solid and never disappoints, just not amazing."

We did manage to have some communication error (though I'm not sure on whose fault because it might be the lack of English skills on part of the waitress, but it doesn't matter at this time) with an order, but they fixed that for us.\n\nWe ordered L5. Pad Kee Mow with beef (flat wide rice noodles stir-fried w/ mint, chili, tomatoes, & Thai spices) and I liked the noodles. Eventually, I was just grabbing the noodles to eat. Beef was good, too.\n\nOur second order was T2. Ped Nom Tok (sliced boneless roasted duck homemad w/ chili pastte, herbs, spices, & lime juice). I couldn't tell that it was duck but it was yummy in a weird way? It was the sauces and spice and everything nice on it, I suppose? Haha. I would order it again, at least :b.\n\nI will definitely be back in on a future visit to try their other dishes. I would like to try some more of fellow yelpers' recommendations :)."

Their crab fried rice is excellent, uses real crab meat and is a large portion. Their orange chicken is great! It is crispy, orangey, and hot when it comes out. Spring rolls and peanut sauce were awesome as well. The rolls were nice, crispy, and very fresh. The sauce was flavorful and did not taste like it was previously stored. The only downside I see here is the pop background music, not a fan of listening to top 40's while I'm eating."

We usually get the  Massa man Curry, Thai egg rolls, and Pad Prik King. The flavors are good, they are accommodating to personalization, prompt on checking on you, and super friendly.\n\nWe always had the same waitress at the beginning and she knew our order and the ladies there always would say hi and play with our young son if it wasn't crowded. I have taken friends there almost every time they come to town and they all enjoyed it too."

The green beans are still slightly crisp and the red chile paste is spicy good.  Next we get the sweet and sour pork, with the veggies cut in decent size wedges covered in a tangy sauce.  We then got the spicy eggplant with pork.  I love sweet thai basil.  Finally we got the pad thai noodle.  This is always one of our favorites and this one is up there with some of the best.\n\nThe food was very good, the service was excellent, worth a return trip."

The food has varied on my visits between outstanding and good. It's not always consistent, which is why it gets only 4 stars.\n\nDo: Try the pineapple rice, it's so damn good!\nDon't: Accidentally wander in to the shady looking massage parlor right next door. Weera is fairly nondescript, as is the massage parlor. I nearly ended up through that door by mistake on my first visit."

I called one day to make an order for pick up because I was sick, so I ordered the usual beef salad but this time I also asked for a Thai iced tea and asked if I could put a little ice. He said he would have to charge me extra for less ice. So I told them to scratch the ice tea off. Then he says, \"ok, so you don't want to order anything\" ummm. No why would I not want my salad I love and get at least once a week?! The fuck! I thought to myself. I should of gone somewhere else but I was sick and Hungry. Also what do you expect from an Asian place. Most Asian are bad with customer service."

We can actually have a conversation!  The employees, from the chef to the wait staff, are wonderful people who truly care who came in to dine.  The menu is fantastic in its variety, and their specialty is duck.  For vegetarians, the tofu eggplant is divine & they will accommodate any appetite.  We love the chicken basil (or eggplant), Pad Thai shrimp, all of the curries, several duck specialties, mango salad & daily specials.  Weera also has happy hour 7 days a week which includes great drink prices & several appetizers.\n\nBON APPETIT to you at Weera Thai!\n\nK I K I"

The bill was wrong and took a few times to fix e.g. we ordered 3 Thai ice tea together and we were charged for 7, 3 of which with the $1.50 deal, and 4 more at full price which we didn't order or get.

I have a food allergy to onions, so the soup was suspect - when questioned, it was removed to be sure.    \n\nCondiment jars: Thai \"chilis\" were jalapenos in vinegar, no peanuts, three versions of red sauce.  I prefer bird's eye that chili in fish sauce.  \n\nHeat: Ordered a 4/5.  Nice glowing heat, but half the jar of vinegar jalapenos climbed it up to face sweat under the eyes.  Happy.    \n\nIn conclusion: reliable thai food, looked at what others ordered and wondered what it was as it looked very good.  My onion allergy limits my options, but always looking for good food."

Sauces that are so rich that you leave feeling bloated and bogged down.\n\nThat notion was not present here.  Everything, from the crab stick appetizers right on down to the wonderful curries, has a lightness and delicate nature to it.  Fresh.  Flavorful.  Complex.  Satisfying, yet leaving you wanting more.  More of the fantastic flavors of Thai food without that after-Thanksgiving-dinner feel to it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, you will walk out of here full, but not over stuffed.\n\nAnother positive: service is friendly, attentive, dare I say sweet?\n\nDo not be weary of Weera Thai.  After trying seven things on the menu, it is clear to me that they know how to serve up some amazing Thai dishes."

Those dishes are some of our go to dishes. If you download the app five stars, you accumulate points with Weera Thai. You can get free entrees, appetizers, etc. What's nice about Five Stars is that Weera noticed my birthday was coming up so they offered a complimentary dessert. You know I can't pass up dessert, so we decided to get the sticky rice with mango. :) soooo good!! And the portion was perfect!!! That was really cool!"

I have had this three times and they always put a lot of crispy duck that complements a tangy salad of greens, cherry tomatoes, Papaya, cashews and more. \n\nI have also had the pad sew eww which was great but I would have like more veggies, but the noodles and sauce are perfect- fresh and delicious.\n\nOne item that surprised me was the mango sticky rice. I typically don't indulge in these kind of desserts, but I was pregnant and it sounded good. Now it is a standard when I go here and I'm not even pregnant anymore! The sweet rice comes with a always ripe mango and a warm milky sauce. Delish!\n\nAlways great food and I have been and ordered delivery. Great service for both!"

I love places like this that offer brown rice as an alternative and decided to substitute white for brown. The crab fried rice was full of flavor and tasted like they used fresh crab. The duck curry was awesome but was a little too spicy for a #3 but like most Thai places i always believe the number depends on the chef that day. \n\nFor desert we decided on the durian sticky rice with coconut milk. Now for all of you that don't know what durian is its that infamous stinky fruit usually found in most Asian markets. At first I was hesitant to try the desert so I tasted the rice without the fruit and it was pretty good. I then tried it with the durian and it was like nothing I've tasted before and considered it one of the best deserts I've ever tasted. \n\nGood Thai food and really friendly staff and the best stinky sticky rice I've ever tasted."

After pulling in I started to question his choice but upon walking in, wow really nicely decorated and everything was sparkling clean!  \n\nWe came right before happy hour ended (it ends at 7pm) so we ordered a couple of half price apps to start.  We decide to eat family style and just try a bunch of new stuff.\n\nOur appetizers included fried tofu, thai egg rolls.  Our dinner included the specialty that everyone who comes here seems to talk about fried papaya salad, amazing but eat it fast because after it cools not as good.  Pork Larb, a new dish for me it is a citrusy  mint meat dish, delish when eaten over rice and definite redo.  Panange chicken curry my boyfriends favorite dish quite good here.  Fried Mussels coated in egg batter, not my favorite dish seemed overly oily but the size of the mussels were large!  We finished with the sticky rice and mango, mango perfectly ripe and the creamy flavored rice do to perfection.\n\nI tried a bit of everything then went back for seconds on the items I liked best which was everything except one so needless to say I was beyond stuffed.  I think this place is gonna give Lotus a run for it's money.  I will defiantly be back!"

It's always really wonderful.  \n\nWe usually get the crab sticks, sometimes that large soup (I think they are all great) the papaya salad (the best!).  We love it all.  Haven't had anything there that wasn't hot and super yummy.  We have probably been there 15 times now.\n\nThe only deficit I would say is that once in a while, the service is a leetle bit lacking.  Nothing major though and the servers are very nice, always!  Would also love it if they'd install a soda machine.  Nothing like cold Coca Cola (with free refills)  to go with the hot and spicy food of Weera Thai."

(Dragging feet) \n\nAs I lay in the hotel bed on my tummy browsing yelp for good yummy vegas eats. I couldn't decide between  between Thai food or indian food. Hmmm...which one? (Thinking mode) I called Weeras and placed an order over the phone. 1) Thai tea 2) Dessert: sticky rice with mango 3) Pad see ew 4) Mango shrimp salad. Order was successfully placed with a long 45 minute wait. Oh boy the nervousness kicked in...\" I hope this food is good.\" \n \nI reminisced about my day at I.B.S. What a spectacular day it had been! My smile was quite frozen in place after meeting Ty Pennington. My 1st real up close celebrity meeting. My thoughts were eventually interupted by my 2 year old who called me from his ipad. My little precious nephew. Never fails to make me smile. He kept me busy until *ding dong* \"Yesss\" the food was here. With a quick bye I raced to the kitchen. \nStanding over the dining table. I reached into the double bagged goodness. Everything was wrapped great. Out came the Thai teas. It almost felt like xmas. Unwrapping all the goodness. I opened the sticky rice mango dessert. Yes!!! Im guilty. I had dessert with dinner. I couldn't get enough of the rice and coconut flavor with a bite of sweet ripe mango. I felt I had landed in tropical heaven. \nJust when things couldn't get better. I opened the shrimp mango salad. Tasted very similar to papaya salad. But with huggggggeee shrimp (which I didn't eat) and loads of cashews. The combinations were orgasmic. Ba baM! \nThe pad see ew was yum. Only one bite. I was 2 busy drooling over the mango goodness. Taking one bite of salad and another Bite of sticky rice. It was a tie between both!!!! \nSo with that said this place is a .....\nMust Try!!!\n-delivery charge $3 +tip \n-order placed with ease over phone. \n-food arrived in 30 min instead of 45min\n-leftovers next day taste just as great."

The decor was decent, with my only complaint being a few antique American posters around the room under all the Thai decorations. They do have excellent service as they are extremely attentive and polite. \n\nI think their specialty is duck items, and I do agree. Their Laab was tasty and savory without being too herby. \n\nWe also had Pad Thai and Pad Se-ew, which was also also good without being too salty and too sweet (for the Pad Thai). \n\nWe also ordered 2 Tom Yum dishes: (1) seafood (2) pork ribs(? - can't remember.. some type of pork bone). In terms of favorite dish, I would go with the pork ribs tom yum because I prefer my dishes sour and I don't really prefer tomatoes, which make soups slightly sweet. In fact, we liked the pork ribs tom yum so much, we ordered another! :D The seafood tom yum was still okay though, just not suited for my tastes. A fair warning though; the preparations are Thai in custom, so they leave inedible herbs in the soup to maintain authenticity. You will know they are inedible because they are really chewy; I would just scoop it out. \n\nThe great thing is, they do allow you to change the level of spiciness. I believe there are 5 levels you can choose from, depending on how hot you can handle the food. \n\nFinally, the famous Thai tea. I have to say, it was fine to me, but I have a sweet tooth, so this tea may be too sweet for the average person. However, I've had teas that are just too strong in tea level, and this one was just fine.\n\nAll in all, great job so far. If I were them, I would make new take-out menus soon and change the front of the restaurant to get rid of the \"Royal Thai\" name and put in Weera Thai so people do not get confused."

Every time I come here, the owner asks me if there is anything he can do better.  And every time I come here, the food gets better!  This is a respectful business that could easily turn into a regular spot for me.\n\nToday I had the Rad Nah, the Pa Cha, and the Roast Duck with Weera sauce.  \n\nThe Rad Nah was spot on in the gravy department.  It was thick, tasty, and smokey.  The noodles were pretty good, and the pork was really well prepared.  I would say that Weera does a pretty good Rad Nah, and that makes me happy.  \n\nThe Roast Duck dish we had was really tasty.  It was just a bit plate of sliced duck, along with a sweeter sauce.  The duck was well prepared, not fatty or gristly.  Another solid dish for Weera.\n\nThe Pa Cha was really spot on.  The Pa Cha isn't as strong as the versions I have had at other Thai restaurants that make this wonderful Thai dish, but the fried catfish was really yummy. We ordered it a 5/5 spice level, and it was spot on with flavor and heat.  I really recommend this dish at Weera.  They do it well.\n\nDue to the A+ service and the improved food here, I am happy to say that Weera has earned a star in my book.  I will definitely be returning more often.  I have yet to try the curries, but I believe that Weera's specialties will be the soups and the stir fry dishes."

I've gone a couple times here, once for lunch and once for dinner (just missed happy hour by 4 minutes and didn't get the benefit of the doubt on pricing).  My Thai friend wanted to eat here because they featured an Issan menu which is where she is from. \n\nWhy the dilemma in star rating? Well, the restaurant is clean, looks like its got new flooring, tables and chairs, and nicely decorated even though its in a run down strip mall just south of Decatur on Sahara. Parking can be kind of tight.\n\nThe service for our two visits was exceptional. Seated quickly, waters brought immediately, drink orders taken within 5 minutes. Food comes quickly too. \n\nFood, this is where is becomes a bit muddled for me. First time I had the Chicken Pad Thai lunch special ($7.95). Comes with a salad and soup. The presentation isn't as nice as Naga Thai in Henderson. The soup is nothing special at all and the salad basic but larger. The pad thai was delicious with plenty of peanuts off to the side along with other condiments. 4/5\n\nFor dinner I had Pork Pad See Ewe (sorry my spelling sucks). Good sized portion, but like only 3 mini stalks of chinese broccoli. Wasn't the best I've had and this is one of my staple thai orders so a little disappointed. 3/5\nCrab rangoon appetisers were really good, loaded with cream cheese and not so much crab but the wrapper is light and crunchy. Very good 4.5/5\n\nMy Thai friend ordered Larb Ped and Papaya Salad at lunch, and Duck Bone Soup and Beef Stew Noodle Soup for dinner, She gave them medium reviews as they weren't spicy enough for her Issan tastebuds except the Papaya Salad. I sampled the Beef Stew Noodle soup and it tasted like Thai Pho, It was good for me because it wasn't spicy. The Duck Bone Soup fired me up with just a taste of the broth. I don't like spicy food though. \n\nOverall, somewhere around a 3.8 star rating. I'd go back for the service and cleanliness of the restaurant, just at happy hour to take advantage of some better pricing. Wednesdays from 4-10pm is Singha beer specials, one of my favorites."

They have other solid menu items, and for a great price.\n\nI have been here about 10 times.  On my last visit, I ordered a pad-thai with no spices (like I always do).  The dish came out very spicy, uneatable for me.  I told the waitress, who said that I couldn't send the dish back.  I told her to ask the manager, which she did, and was told I had to accept the dish.  I said it was too spicy, I don't eat spices and this wasn't what I ordered, so I wasn't paying for it.  She said okay, so I ate my other (I was really hungry) dishes and left for the Hawaiian place next door (which is amazing).\n\nThat was the most absurd experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  The management clearly didn't care that either their waitress (who barely spoke English) or their cook messed up my order and a repeat customer was unhappy.  With actions like that, I'm hard pressed to see how they will stay in business."

            "review": "We ordered delivery from here twice while we were on vacation in Las Vegas. We were happy that they delivered to the Westgate Resort, though I had to meet them outside the hotel because they aren't allowed to deliver to the rooms apparently. They will instruct you to meet them at the valet parking (this is the main entrance to the hotel on the west side). However, it would be much smarter to meet guests either at the North Tower or East Tower entrance. It's less busy here and more convenient access from the guest rooms. Sometimes the valet/main entrance area has 50+ cars including buses and taxis moving in and out. Not to mention that it's a hike from here back to your room. The North or East Tower Entrances would be much more convenient for their customers, which should be the focus. However, delivery was quite fast and the food was great. \n\nDuring our two meals, we had the Mongolian beef, BBQ pork, beef stir fry with garlic pepper sauce (excellent), seafood soup w/shrimp, spicy pork, egg rolls, and papaya salad. Everything was very tasty, though my wife thought the papaya salad wasn't consistent with the Isaan-style papaya salad she's used to. And I wouldn't recommend the Mongolian beef as it is nowhere near as good as most Mongolian beef that I've had at Chinese restaurants. And that's probably the key - this is a Thai restaurant and the Mongolian beef is a Chinese (or Chinese-American) dish. The beef stir fry with garlic pepper sauce however was excellent. The Thai egg rolls also excellent. \n\nThe total came to $50 on one occasion and $60 on the 2nd occasion. Which I think is a bit pricey for 2 entrees, 2 appetizers, and no drinks/desert. So minus -1 star for being a bit over priced.  Recommended."

I told her Weera had gone downhill but she wanted it anyway. I said fine. We ordered around 9:30 (they close at 10) for delivery. The guy delivers around 10, and when we get around to eating we see that they left out a thai tea. I paid for it, but they left it out, and they were already closed. Thank goodness I ordered from eat24 cuz the guy took it off for me. Fast forward to today and I really wanted thai food so I tried them one more time. Ordered online, and this time I decided to have my hubby pick it up. He got there and they asked him for his credit card. I already paid online. Basically I was charged twice. Is everyone over there new and they don't know to check if things have already been paid for? Why does the service suck so much these days?

I actually came to eat here by happenstance. In what appears to be a sleazy strip mall, the diadem of Thai flavors is hidden amongst the now-gone seedy massage parlors. I walked into friendly greetings and a warm smile. As the years past, this restaurant has expanded into an upscale ambiance, where you can dine in dressed-up attire or gym clothes, as I have often done.\n\nAt first, I kept coming back due to their lunch specials. A heaping portion of THE BEST pad thai in the Western United States, a bowl of field greens salad, and a cup of soup de jour ranging from tom kha to tom yum to accompany the egg roll allowed this pescatarian to enjoy great food without having to pick out bits of chicken or beef or pork. I have tried other pad thai dishes in Nevada, California, and Arizona based on Yelpers in those regions and nothing has come close to the sweet and savory flavors in Weera Thai's pad thai.\n\nAlbeit the food warms the soul, I keep coming back due to the consistency that Weera Thai provides during lunch and dinner. Yeah you get the occasional heavy hand with the same spice level, but the food and customer service always remains top notch. Refills of water without asking, new silverware and plates between courses, and a rotating \"specials\" menu will have you asking how such a 5-star location continues growing its business off the Strip.\n\nChef Peter and Sasi is the duo you wish to grow up and emulate when you find that special someone. Their hearts are just as big as their creative ingenuity. You are always treated with the utmost respect from the staff, even the people that yell angry epithets at them for their food not coming out as quickly as fast food. They are always appreciative of your business, feedback, and happy demeanor after sharing a meal with them. Kudos to Weera Thai. You'll be sure to see me here at least once every week. :]"

I ordered vegetable fried rice and wonton soup. The fried rice is excellent; not overly greasy and enough egg with perfectly cooked veggies. The wonton soup was a hit too. The broth was delicious and flavorful. Took note that those 2 will be ordered again in the future. I had the shrimp pad thai and hubby got the green curry with beef, both spicy #3 (medium). Fantastic, as expected! \n\nThe excellent service made the whole experience a 4 star. For a Friday night, we got seated right away, waited about 10 minutes for our orders, and our drinks were always filled. We were disappointed they didn't have the mango with sticky rice, but understood that it's seasonal so we got the coconut ice cream instead (also delicious and my 3 yo devoured it in minutes). \n\nCan't wait to go back and try their other entrees!"

Quite a lot in fact.  Weera Thai is one of my favorites.  The food here is more flavorful than that at Pad Thai restaurant.  Especially when it comes to spice.  Their spice level goes up to five though I am only willing to try a three at this point.  After that, it becomes too much for me.  Typically though, I order no spice.  I like to let the true flavor of the meal shine through and not be concealed by overbearing heat.  Some dishes just don't need the heat.  Like sweet and sour chicken.  Let the sweet and sour stand on its own.  The tempura is perfect thickness.  The sauce is tangy.  They vegetables are crisp and fresh.  No change necessary.  The pad thai here is some of the best I have had.  The rice noodles are chewy.  The flavors are intense.  The chicken is tender.  A great dish.  So far the only dish I have ordered that I did not enjoy is the pepper garlic chicken.  Actually, I ordered beef and received chicken.  I did not care for it at all.  First of all, I prefer white meat when eating chicken.  This was fatty dark meat.  Second, I was not expecting black pepper.  I thought it would be very garlicy with fresh chili peppers.  I don't care for the taste of massive amounts of black peppercorn.  I will not order that again.  \n\nAll of the lunch specials are served with steamed rice (unless noted otherwise), an egg roll and a small salad.  For a price ranging from $6.99 to $7.99, depending on your choice of protein, Weera Thai is a little higher priced than some other Thai options but the price shine through in the quality.  This is one of my go to places for Thai take-out in regular rotation."

I would have to say that this is an exceptional place for Northern Thai food! \n\nThey have a happy hour from about 4-7pm, but they extended the offer until 9pm today. So, I tried their Crispy Papaya Salad with shrimp offered at $5.00. This was amazing! The dressing is a slightly sweet lime juice, which goes great with the julienned papaya, cut green beans, tomatoes, and peanuts. \n\nFor an entree, I chose the Red Curry Pumpkin at spicy level of two. This Thai red curry has Thai spices, chilies, bamboo shoots & coconut milk, with your choice of meat. I selected the crab meat. It was served in a huge oblong bowl with brown rice on the side. The flavors were sublime! It was a generous portion for less than $15.00.\n\nFor dessert, I had to try the mango and sticky rice to compare to Archi's. Although it was a large portion with fresh ripe mangoes that were delectable, the sticky rice and coconut milk was a little too sweet for my liking. To avoid this in the future, I could order the coconut milk on the side.\n\nI enjoyed their Jasmine hot tea with dinner and dessert. The china was beautiful. The service was excellent!

But later on you will realize that you ate durian.  Your breath will be horrible.  And if you don't know what durian is, don't try it.  You will regret it, eventually.  I'm apparently a glutton for punishment.\n\nService was good.  A little timid but good.  The servers hovered with concern a lot but ultimately knew when to come in and ask if we needed anything.\n\nI recommend trying the pork jerky.  And let me know if you actually get anything spicy here.  We asked for food as spicy as possible and it came out not so spicy.  But maybe we did not look Thai enough?\n\nInteresting variety of food and good service garners this establishment a \"Yay!\""

So it really boils down to the dining experience for me.  Weera is a low-key, intimate space with soft lighting and a conservative selection of sakes and wine.  When we went, there were couples on dates, families with kids, groups of friends and a table of 6-footer models.  I think anyone would be happy with this space and food.  Service was great but quite slow on a Friday night.  \n\nThe first bite we had of their pad thai was bit of a letdown, but the next few bites we took must've had some voodoo spice or spell because we were loving it more and more.  It was a dish that did not wow you with a punch, but the flavors crept up on you like the butler on Mr. Deeds... very very sneaky.  We also had the Thai chicken wings, sauce on the side for my little man.  Bad idea.  There wasn't any flavor on the naked wing.  The final order was Crispy Pork Basil.  I haven't heard my hubby say it in a long time but he muttered \"Holy Lord God.\"  He was enamored.  To me, it was very good, close to perfection with its slightly sweet buttery sauce, the balance with crisp vegetables and the yummy fried pork (normally I like to keep the sauce off fried skin to keep it crisp).  Overall though, we were very happy with the food.  They even provide kiddie plates.  50 brownie points right there!\n\nSo many Thai options... but we would definitely go back to this one.  Wee heart you Weera!"

They would have served us, but we found out that, despite the long conversation we had with the owner the last time we were there, they still had only a very limited selection of wine, and nothing we'd drink.  The owner suggested we go to Weera Thai, just a few doors down.  Alas, he may regret his decision to send us there.\n\nAt nearly 10 p.m., unlike the empty restaurant we'd just left, Weera was hopping, and we got the only available table.  And they had the Riesling we like to drink.\n\nWe ordered soup, and when it was served, it wasn't the Tom Kah Kai we usually order, but the Tom Yum Kai.  It was my mistake, and the waitress (owner?) offered to change it, but we decided to keep it.  And it was beyond delicious!\n\n\nWe shared a Mussamun Curry with beef, and for once I gave in to hubby's Pad Thai request.  Both were excellent, and the Mussamun had the distinction of having much more \"stuff\" than the vacant bowl of sauce that we've experienced at too many other Thai restaurants.\n\nService was excellent, and we think we've found our new favorite Thai place."

I have been here twice but a few years back, today was the first time trying this place after post renovation. \n\nFood has always been good but the place went from casual, quick food to more modern and have more unique items. The new design is very pretty, more modern, brighter, nice and clean. They also expanded so the restaurant is larger now, great for large and small parties. \n\nWe were greeted immediately, water was brought out as soon as we sat down. Their Thai Tea is soooo good, you can clearly smell and taste the tea and not too sweet to where you get sick of it easily, plus the tea came in a large glass, definitely bigger than other places. Our waitress Arunothai was so nice, she made recommendations, answered questions and was so patient as we looked through our menu (their menu is huge! so many options!!).\n\nThey have the big menu and they have a smaller brown menu that you should definitely ask for, our waitress said the items on the brown menu are authentic Thai items. \n\nWe ordered total of 7 items and the two that stood out were the Pork Liver Larb and the Fried Catfish Papaya Salad. The larb is cooked medium based on our server's reccomendation, and it was delicious, the liver was so soft, the sauce tasted amazing! This dish was gone pretty quickly! The catfish was very different, have never had something like this. The catfish is shredded and mixed with...something...then deep fried with papaya salad on top with salted duck egg and pork skin on the side. First of all this dish is HUGE, definitely can be shared. We love papaya salad, order it every time we go eat Thai, the catfish and the salted egg are nice addition of the traditional salad.  \n\nThe stir fried clams was also very good, lots of clams compared to other places where you get a bunch of empty shells. The sauce was amazing, sweet and salty, and a little spicy! We ordered 8 items but only 7 was brought out, which was fine since we were stuffed. \n\nWe ordered 7 items, 2 extra rice bowls, a pot of tea, and a Thai tea and the check came out under $100. Not expensive at all, great price, great portion, good service, and good food. Will definitely come back for more."

The flavors were delicious and unique. After coming here for dinner, I was sold on this place. Thinking of how delicious this place was for an entire week, we returned here again on a Sunday for a lunch special. We ordered the red curry lunch special and the black peppered chicken which comes with a fried spring roll, salad, and a little soup. We also ordered the fresh veggie spring rolls. I wasn't a fan of anything we ordered. Everything tasted light and watered down. The black peppered chicken was far from palatable. The fresh veggie spring rolls tasted ordinary. We were disappointed, but I am sure we will go back again and try this place again.

We have also tried their appetizer sampler and absolutely loved it. It is rare to order a sampler and love everything on the plate, but I did. It consisted of cream cheese ragoons, stuffed chicken wings, spring rolls with several types of sauce including peanut, and sweet and sour type varying in intensity. I also enjoyed their combination drunken noodles with a generous portion of meats and shrimp.

When we walked inside no one was eating and I thought it was kind of odd considering it was a Saturday night.  We immediately ordered our Thai Teas and since I have been craving curry for so long I ordered the yellow curry with chicken (yes, I know I like to play it safe). For our appetizer we had the fresh spring rolls with tofu. And when I took my first bite I tasted the rice noodles and something else almost like meat. But it was actually the tofu! The peanut sauce was also a nice compliment!  Very tasty and I recommend ordering this if you're contemplating on ordering an appetizer. The curry was pretty good hardly any spice at all because I requested for level 1 (their spice scale here is 1-5). The dish also had carrots and potatoes. Does this normally come with potatoes because I wasn't expecting it at all? The servers were very friendly and checked up on us regularly. They require a $15 minimum with card or they charge you a .25 cents fee, which is not bad at all. I don't think I'd be back here again, but worth going to if you're going to use a groupon, yelp deal, or living social coupon."

I ordered delivery tonight for a specific time. Unfortunately about an hour before the delivery was due I found out my husband had an accident and I had to rush off to go pick him up. I called the restaurant and asked them if they could just deliver 1 hour later. They told me they had already left with the food and couldn't do anything to help me. Uhm... what? You were going to be an hour early from our scheduled delivery time? I'm only 3 miles away. after some arguing they finally agreed to deliver my food at the requested time but said that since they had already made it that it would be cold. So you're telling me I just paid $15 per person for cold food? No. I don't want cold food. The girl on the phone said she would check with her manager and call me back. An hour later I hadn't received a call back so I called the company I ordered through who told me Weera rescheduled delivery for tomorrow at 8PM? What? So they called them again and Weera showed up 15 minutes later with their driver complaining to us about the delivery complication. Well I'm sorry I tried to give you pretty much an hour advance notice before the scheduled delivery time. The Thai Iced Teas were terrible and taste like old stale tea. All of the food was soggy and the vegetables weren't fresh at all. I'm positive that they did not prepare fresh food for us... this was a microwaved soggy mess version of what they used to be. \n\nWe used to order from Weera at least once a week and have spent thousands of dollars at their restaurant and referred MANY people to them. I'm really disappointed in this entire experience particularly the lack of compassion and rude attitude I received from their employees when I had just explained that my husband was in an accident and I had to leave right away. I guess this is goodbye to Weera... it's been a nice run guys but as a formerly loyal customer I don't deserve that kind of treatment particularly when there are at least 5 other Thai restaurants in this area that deliver."

I have been to Weera Thai a few times in the past year for dinner and most recently for lunch.  After trying out their regular menu and also one of their lunch specials, I personally think that you get more value ordering from their non-lunch specials menu, even if it is before 3pm during their lunch special promotion hours.  \n\nSo don't be cheap and walk out becuase your party came in 2 minutes past the lunch specials promotion period. The $2-3 extra you pay for each entree will defintiely get you much more food, in spite of the trade off of not getting the cup of house soup, fried egg roll and a lunch side salad (all are rather unimpressive). \n\nThe staff have always been friendly, and deliver the prepared dishes shortly after it was cooked with care in the kitchen.  Their Green Curry is bomb.  Their Spicy Glass Noodle Salad is healthy and delicious, and can easily substitute as an entree or be shared as an appetizer salad.  The Pad See Ew is one of the best I have tried in all of Las Vegas. If you enjoy having duck, their Slice Duck (Weera Thai Style) will not disappoint.  The Thai Fish Cakes appetizer is generous and good.   The Spicy Thai Sweet Basil made with Beef lunch special was just okay at best, maybe it is better prepared with anything but beef, but it was definitely my least favorite item that I have tried at this cool restaurant.\n\nIf you have room in your tummy after your meal, consider getting their Durian over Warm Sticky Rice (assuming you do not have an Andrew Zimmern aversion to this pungent fruit).  Otherwise, get their Mango Sticky Rice during the summer, when mangos are in season.\n\nAfter reading Yuhi K's review, I must remember to order the Coconut Water served in a young coconut, instead of the common Thai Iced Tea or Thai Iced Coffee, on my future visits.  And try one of the Steamed Sea Bass as recommended by Arvin when I am in the mode for fish.  When winter finally arrives, definitely going to have to try their Thai Beef Noodle Soup, the best of Las Vegas according to Theresa C.\n\nAmbiance: 3.5/5.  Comfortable dining environment with Thai decorations and even a small television showing Thai programming featuring what appears to be a Thai food channel.  On the larger flat panel TV on the right side of the restaurant, it is usually on FoodTV or one of the professional sports games.  But the audio entertainment is provided by Sirius Radio's POP stations.\n\nService:  4/5.  Freindly, attentive. No complaints.\n\nFood:  4/5.  Again, you pay slightly more but also get great value when ordering from their regular menu san the lunch specials.\n\nParking:  4/5.  Usually it is not a problem finding parking.\n\nLocation:  Fairly close to the Sahara exit on the I-15, so perfect if you are staying at Palace Station down the street.  Otherwise, easily accessible in a centrally convenient location for most resident of Las Vegas.\n\n4 Stars. A no brainer.  \n\nSide note:  The restaurant is aggressively promoting itself online, so you can usually find check-in offers (via Yelp get 10% off your bill), or promotions like Yelp Deals and occasional promotions from other competitors. Just tip on the pre-discounted price of your meal."

Located in a run down strip mall on Sahara, its always hard to venture off into some less lit parking lots. \n\nGreat vibes from the moment you walk in, the decor makes it feel very home-y and authentic. \n\nI ordered the shrimp and mushroom Tom Yum soup, and with every bite it kept getting better and better. I should've ordered a large it was so good! \n\nNext you can never go wrong with some Thai Beef salad but this one was amazing. On their range of spicy-ness from 1-5, I ordered a 3 and it was perfect. Not too much spice you burn your mouth, just enough to enjoy the salad. \n\nFinally we asked the waitress what dessert she recommends, and she mentioned the Bua Lua (Taro) dish.. oh my.. what a way to top off the whole meal. Its a warm coconut milk with boba like texture balls..  definitely ordering that again! \n\nThe whole spontaneous decision to find a thai restaurant was totally worth it after finding this place, my new go-to spot!"

We got three appetizers because there was a photo of happy hour specials for $3.33 between 5-8pm. The crab rangoon, crispy shrimp and dynamite chicken wings. all amazing and delicious. especially loved the crab Rangoon. \nfor the entree we took misti's suggestion and decided to split green curry, and we got it with duck at a level 3 spiciness. It really wasn't spicy at all but it was SOOO good.  indeed the best green curry Ive had in Vegas, with huge chunks of eggplant and duck meat. mmm. I also had the Harney & Sons tea, it was very good. \nEverything was perfect except for the bill at the end of the meal. They did take off the $20 from the coupon, but the appetizers were not $3.33 each. When I asked the waitress about it she said that they no longer did happy hour. So I said to her, but I asked at the beginning of the meal if there was happy hour and you guys said there was...she looked confused and blank, and apologized that her English wasn't that good. I believe it was the drink waitress who said the deal was valid and the food waitress that said it wasn't but in the end, we paid $21 for appetizers instead of $10, which was really disappointing. \nStill, I'll go back, it was fun to discover a new place, (and there was a promising korean restaurant next door too!) I recommend you check it out too, but don't count on happy hour appetizer specials. at least, get it in writing first. :P"

My friend I was with had never had a papaya salad before (one of my staples when I'm eating Thai) she doesn't like spicy food, so I had to tone it down for her, we ordered 2/5, it is true Thai Chili spice, so be careful when ordering. This was perfect. I ordered the Garlic Shrimp, this was the chef's special, it wasn't your typical garlic shrimp that I'm used to ordering. The shrimp are actually pan fried and served with the shells on. I was trying to be healthy, so I was a bit disappointed when I saw that it was pan fried, but it was really good. If you're not ok with eating the shells, I wouldn't bother ordering this dish. My friend had the Tofu Panang, she raved that it was the best she has ever had. \n\nTheir menu is $3-4 higher on each dish than other Thai places in town. They do have a full Issan style menu."

We ordered the pad see ew, larb salad, Thai spring rolls, and red curry chicken. The minute my daughter tasted the red curry chicken she proclaimed \"This is the best curry I've ever eaten.\" It was wonderful I'll admit. The Thai spring rolls were so fresh and crunchy that I only got to eat one as my 2 kids swarmed them. The pad see ew didn't disappoint as the Chinese broccoli was plentiful and the pork cooked to tender perfection. The larb I ordered with a spice level 3 and the flavor was amazing. What I love about Thai food is that unexpected matching of cool cucumbers with hearty ground chicken, spiced with peppers and cilantro. It's like comfort food with a kick. Don't let the exterior strip mall discourage you from trying this place. Once inside you'll find an upscale dining establishment with an attentive wait staff and insanely delicious food. The portions were huge and we enjoyed the leftovers for a few days after. If you like Thai food, you will love this place. I can't wait to go back and try the duck curry that our neighboring table raved about."

Crab rangoon should be simple and other restaurants add too many spices to out do other locations to get the American market.

After our first bite we both just stared at each other and said, \"oh my god.\" I don't know what kind of coconut milk they used but it was probably the best Panang curry I've had here. We got it in a spice level 3 (out of 5), but I'd probably get it in a 4 next time because I think it'd be even more amazing with just a little more spice added. It came with a side if white rice, but after we ate all of it we ended up pouring it on top of the Rainbow rice which proved to be a good idea. \n\nSince we ate so much rice, we got full pretty fast and got a little of everything to go. Needless to say I'm pretty excited to eat leftovers tonight!\n\n5 stars in my book\n\n\nBonus: they have drink happy hour from 4-8 (possibly 3-7, so you might want to verify)"

Since we have a rental car, it wasn't a big deal driving there.  The place is located in a quiet strip mall with tons of parking.\n\nMy husband was craving for some real coconut and being from the Philippine Island, we grew up eating this stuff.  I was really surprised that it tasted exactly like it was in the islands - fresh, sweet and refreshing.  If I didn't eat too much, I can probably finish another one.  So when you come, make sure you order that!\n\nTo eat, we had the Crispy Duck Salad and the Garlic SeaBass.  If you know me, crispy duck and sea bass are two of my favorite things!   They were wonderful.  The servings were enormous and can actually feed 4 people total.   We decided we didn't want to waste any food so we sat there for hours and savored our food down to the last morsel.  In the end, we had difficulty standing up and walking to our car but no regrets!  The best Thai food we ever had:))\n\nAnd as a bonus, the staff are all very friendly and nice.  They never stopped checking on us and they're always smiling.  That's probably the reason why we ate so much!"

I had take out once from here that a friend ordered and it was so good I wanted the flavors again. \n\nI was greeted when I walked in and told to sit anywhere. The nice lady came over brought me water. I ordered pineapple fried rice with chicken, pad see ew with beef and a Thai iced tea. \n\nThe pineapple fried rice is amazing you have your choice of meat. The rice is cooked with yellow curry, big chunks of tomatoes, big chunks of pineapple, cashews and green onion. Huge serving. I chose chicken which was big chunks. \n\nPad see ew is sooo good too! Be careful there are two one is made with curry. It is stated. This one is the regular you pick your choice of meat. Large flat noodles and bok choi in a brown sauce with you meat. I chose beef it compliments the everything very well. Huge servings.\n\nI was going to order egg rolls but I forgot. I always order Thai iced tea it's always soooo good.  I took lots of left overs home but that was the plan. Both heat up nicely and gave me enough for 3 other meals. \n\nPrice wise it averages about $10-$13 an entr\u00e9e. The flavors and portions are worth the price. The staff is nice and attentive. My suggestion would be go in two or more and sample each other's orders or plan on a lot of leftovers."

I usually use either Panang or Red Curry w/Tofu and a Tom Yum Soup w/Chicken as my lab standards. After 4 meals at Weera Thai over the past month, it has because obvious that Weera Thai is my (current) favorite!\n\nVery generous portions and generous proteins in the portions. A large Tom Yum w/Chicken is easily a meal in itself, as is the Panang Curry w/Tofu. Flavor and thickness of curry is spot on, and the price is the best quality-to-value Thai in town. The Tom Yum broth is kept hot in a flame-pot. \n\nThe restaurant is extremely clean, the waitstaff and chef are super nice, and their Sahara Avenue location has proven to be very convenient, inspiring some last-minute Weera Thai redirection when deciding where to eat. Cleanliness was the reason we dumped our old Thai restaurant crush in search of a new one. Weera in love!\n\nI am so confident in Weera Thai that I took my visiting East Coast family (party of 12) there for dinner over the holidays. One of my sisters and brother-in-laws declared Weera's Tom Kha as the best they'd ever had in their lives. \n\nWith the current Yelp Deals promotion ($10 for $20) you cannot afford not to try Weera. Weera is also doing a 10% off special when you check-in on the Yelp app. Yelp friendly indeed. Go tonight!"

I finally made it for lunch a few days ago, and I have to say -it was a disappointing experience.\n\n  I chose menu item F-6 (Spicy Thai Holy Basil with chicken) -which was stir fried chicken, onions, chili, and Thai holy basil leaves. The chicken itself was sliced -not ground and was a little tough and dry. The dish appeared to be swimming in grease -instead of a sauce. I didn't know sliced chicken could be greasy... \n\nThe level 3 spice out of 5 barely registered as spicy, and as a result the food was bland. Why do most Thai places skimp on basil? I thought this was a dish that featured basil?  Instead, I found myself on the hunt looking for basil underneath the rubbery overcooked chicken. \n\nThe restaurant itself is clean, quaint, and inviting. My order was done in 10 minutes which was nice considering I was on my lunch break. However, I would rather they took their time to make sure the dish actually tasted good. \n\nI won't come back as there are just too many good Thai places to choose from in Las Vegas."

We had a little over an hour before closing and rushed over. It's off the strip in a neighborhood not too far from chinatown. \n\nWalked in, was immediately greeted with smiles and escorted to our table. Our waiter was the best! He was so attentive and helpful. He was patient even though we asked several questions about unfamiliar dishes. He offered honest suggestions and had a smile to go with each one. We were curious, indecisive, and wanted leftovers. We ordered yellow curry w/ shrimp, spicy basil fried rice w/ shrimp, crab rolls, chicken fried rice, chicken pad thai, mango sticky rice, and a few alcoholic beverages to go with our meals. Mmm...mmm...good is all we could say. Every forkful was flavorful. \n\nCurry was the right consistency. It was loaded with plump shrimp, potatoes, and carrots. The other noodle and rice dishes were full of fresh veggies and herbs. Portions were large and they did not skimp on meat. The crab rolls were like long egg rolls. They were a tiny bit fishy and may have been better if we ate them right away. Instead, my friend was busy sipping her wine and I, my special menu mojito with fresh chunks of mango. Yum...theee best!! The late night happy hour made them even better. We had plenty of leftovers to take back to the hotel. My friend's boys were still up and ready to eat when we returned. They had never eaten thai food, tried and liked everything. The next day, leftovers were devoured by all of us. \n\nAs for the restaurant...decor was gorgeous and authentic.

It's fresh, well prepared, flavorful, and offers a complexity that most mortals (including some of the top chefs in Vegas who go there) simply cannot prepare at home.   It is clear that the Weera Thai owners and staff actually care, want your dining experience to be positive, and value your business.  Care is taken to keep the restaurant very clean, and the relaxed, casual, atmosphere is great for conversation.  The service is polite, efficient, friendly and attentive, never intrusive.  I've tried most Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, the extensive menu (including Issan) differentiates itself from others. It has rave reviews from a number of  food critics;  A recent Desert Companion review of Thai Restaurants in Las Vegas claimed it \"Best Thai Food in the Universe\" and \"Mind-blowing\".  The portions are ample and the pricing is very reasonable.  \n\nReading the other reviews, ..I've not been there during peak lunch hours.  Keep in mind that it is a small establishment and being way from China Town and the Strip, in a small strip mall, means that it really has to deliver to draw customer in order to offer the more extensive menu; if they are out of eggs rolls...there are so many interesting excellent choices not offered elsewhere.  The Pad Kee Mow (Drunken Noodle),  is outstanding, (I think the owner said that they get the noodles fresh daily!) - I'll take freshness, at the expense of their being out of something on occasion, but personally I've not experienced that.   As of late, I ask the waitresses to select something for me that I haven't tried before - not something I'd not do in many restaurants.  \n\nThere are times where it can be a bit busy in the evening if a number of tables show up at the same time, and there are large groups.  My suggestions is go with friends, or a date and enjoy the dining experience, and the environment that allows for conversation.  I dine out often with friends, and am not a stranger to fine dining, and worked in the restaurant industry myself for many years when younger.\nI was in Las Vegas for Christmas, and went there both Eve and Day with friends (who are from Asia, live in Las Vegas and are knowledgeble and selective about their restaurants, and fine dining).  They loved it.\n\nSome ideas in addition to Specials there: Panang Curry, Pinapple Fried Rice (hint of curry) combination , Tom Yum or Tom Kha Gai, Crab Fried Rice, (can't recall the name...but there's a duck sausage) I finally tried the Papaya Salad (a bit sweet for my taste, and a bit heavy on the dressing for my liking).  I'd order it again, but ask for less dressing and spicer heat level).  I've had the Spicy Thai Holy Basil with Chicken - mentioned by another reviewer -no complaints."

There were 2 head tilting experiences but I'll go ahead and skip the first experience because there isn't enough characters on yelp to thoroughly convey what just happened. When there are paying guests, denying or making excuses for a simple request is a poor business move, especially if it's not compromising the integrity of the establishment or of the food. Anyhow, moving on...\n\nTom yum Kung: 3/5 stars. Good flavor. \n\nSpicy fried rice: 3/5 stars! we had the soup brought out to us first at a level 2 like the server suggested even after I told her that I can eat really spicy foods. Wasn't spicy enough so I had her tell the kitchen to make the rest of the order a level 3/5. Her response, \"well they already made the fried rice, but I can tell them to make your pad see ew spicier.\" \n\nHm...so then I have to add the Sambal and other spices by myself? But then it won't taste the same. Irritating.\n\nPad see ew: 2.5/5 stars. Bland! \n\nMango sticky rice (sauce on side) : 5/5 stars! Bomb! Rice came out fresh and warm, mangos were also fresh with great flavor! \n\nServers were sweet and attentive. I just wished they accommodated what I asked! It's not difficult to re toss the fried rice in more spice even AFTER it was done."

We got seated right away and served glasses of water, but it took fifteen minutes before our order was taken...and we had our menus closed for about 12 of those minutes.  My waitress was not familiar with the wines they were serving and more importantly the food that they were serving. I do not eat any sugar, so I asked about the duck salad warning her I can only eat very little sugar.  I asked her what was in it, she couldn't tell me specifically, just said  vegetables and duck.  I asked her about the sauce, she said it was not sweet, I asked her if the sauce could be put on the side, she said, \"No.\"  However, she came with the alternative that the chef prepare the Duck salad without using sugar. I accepted and ordered the duck salad with 3 star spice.  I then asked about the wines, she knew nothing about wines (fine, I understand not everyone drinks) and quietly flipped over the menu that showed \"Pairings\".  My husband ordered the Tom Yum Kai and Pork Ka Pow , without any modifications other than 3 star spice.  We shared the soup and agreed that if was mostly a premade soup base, which they used too much of.  The broth was too intense, yet not what I would think was 3 star spiciness.   His Ka Pow was very bland and had no resemblance to the Ka Pows we've ordered at other places or made at home.  We had to ask for the chili condiment kit to adjust the spice.  My duck salad was very disappointing given the price and alterations she said they could do...Very little duck, atleast a half mango (she didn't mention there was fruit- again I can't eat sugar including sweet fruit, and then the salad was dressed in a very sweet sauce...even my husband who is sugar tolerant said it was too sweet).  Needless to say, it was disappointing...my Thai craving is still craving."

The food is always, hot and delicious, and they even use great little cardboard Togo boxes. This review is long overdue!***\n\nExperience:  I came in for lunch after one of my chef friends told me to try the Crispy Duck Salad. I've tried many things here, but this is my first time trying this dish. \n\nFacility:  it's located in a tiny strip mall along Sahara.  It's pretty small, but it has booths, tables and chairs and even a few bar seats.  It's a quaint little place that has a small diner like feel. \n\nService:  They sat me immediately in a small booth in the back. Perfect because I'm rollin solo today and prefer not to sit in the middle of the room looking lonely. \n\nFood:  love that they have Coke products!!!!  \nCrispy Duck Salad - (5/5) wow!  He was right!  I don't think they make anything bad here. The duck is crispy and amazing!  The greens, carrots, and tomatoes are fresh and tossed with a sweet and sour type dressing with garlic and cilantro. I ordered it spicy, which adds the perfect balance of heat to the sweetness of the fresh mango!  It also has cashews that add slight decadence and nice crunch to the salad. Great dish!\n\nOverall:  love this place! The worse part about eating here is deciding which dish to order and which dish to forego. I use them regularly to deliver food and stop in from time to time for some eats too.\nUntil someone shows me different...this is my number 1 Thai restaurant!"

The food is great and the thai ladies working there are nice.\n\nSo, for the 4th of July weekend my family planned to go there for dinner. When we arrived, we noticed that they have renovated the place and it was a much bigger than what I used to know. It was busy, but we cared to wait since we wanted to eat some of our usual dishes again. When we got our table, it was a bit awkward because it was squashed between two other tables and one of our chairs was blocking the path to the restrooms which created unwanted passing through by other people and disturbing our dinner. Then, we have this nice thai lady taking order from us. However, she wasn't taking down any notes. Instead, she was memorizing my orders, so seems like she was pretty good at it. Until, we noticed that we made the order before a couple arrived next to us. But, that couple got their food first and one of the waitress accidentally brought the couple's food to our table. We ordered the same type of dish and when the waitress realized she made a mistake, she was confused and took the food back.That is when I realized the lady who took our order made a grave mistake. We ordered the eggplant dish with beef, but it arrived with chicken and as soon as I saw my favorite dish of crispy pork and vegetables, i realized the portion was smaller than before and the quality dropped just by looking at it. Usually I finish the whole plate but this time I cannot chew some of the pieces, the skin felt like rubber. I can sense that the chefs are out of their breath and exhausted from cooking over and over again at a very busy time. Overall, we didn't get to enjoy our dinner fully. I didn't complain because we are already tired and hungry and we don't feel like bringing up these issues. However, the thai lady who took our order was very nice to bring a coloring paper and crayons for my son to keep himself busy."

I came to meet a friend for their lunch special and find it nice to have the salad and soup as a starter which comes with it! Also the soup was their Tom yum so that is nice because I had the chance to taste it for future reference and I would be in favor of it as well. Great portion for a special. This was my first visit which was recommended by my friend so as far as consistency, I will update in the future. I know how much they make you walk past your tables to check on the guest but that would be the only thing I would say that was a little annoying. Only because there were only two tables in the restaurant and I had a small 1 yr old and a 2 year old who were frigidity but not anywhere else but the table. That can feel unwelcoming if I cant dine comfortably without feeling like I'm being watched every 3 minutes or so. I am not exaggerating, and I know this because there was one lady coming to fill our waters but the guy was pacing back and forth looking at our table. When it came time for the check he didn't come back which was also annoying because you would assume he would be on top of it as many times as he passed through. We had to go to the register. All in all, still a great place, maybe just a little space for the customer to not feel like they can't eat in peace."

Both my GF and I loved it.  It was thick, sweet, tasty, spicy, all that a Thai dish should be.  I think we both rated it the best from the thai restaurants we've been.  The cold rolls in rice sheets were also super good, but what made it great was that warm peanut sauce that came with it.  It was peanut creamy, sweet and rich tasting.  Also a high ranker.\n\nThe duck dish was the only thing I thought was OK.  They really tried to pad their pricing by including duck dishes and Sea bass.  There's really no reason to order the duck dish, since it wasn't really very good anyways.  It was a mix of really heavy tasting thai spices, and it was too much for my senses or distinguish any kind of flavor.  Just too strong in my opinion.\n\nWeera makes me a fan.  Also I really enjoyed the way the restaurant looked and how the walls were decorated.  It's pretty nice ambiance for a date.\n\nEdit: 4/16 \nWere Back again!  During lunch this time.  Unfortunately lunch was a big dissapointment.  The portion of the lunch specials was half the dinner portion.  To compensate they include fillers, a salad, a spring roll, a bowl of watered down tom yum soup.  Biggest issue, was the food Must have been cooked by the sous chef.  The red curry was super watery and the  fresh spring rolls that we loved so much last time, the peanut sauce was watered down and full of starch and not rich peanut flavored.  Was 100% different and not remotely good.  i probably wont come here during lunch time.  Ill try this place at dinner again to see if its a consistency issue"

I had the Yelp deal and it worked beautifully.\n\nI started with the crab stick appetizer.  Here's how the menu describes it:  Deep fried rice paper wrapped with mix crab meat & cream sauce, served with homemade plum sauce.  When I saw 6 sticks, I thought there was no way I could eat all of them and have room for dinner.  Wrong!  They were so very tasty you could never leave one to be taken away.  The plum sauce was good, and my server brought me the hot spice holder and I used some chili paste to spice up some of the sticks.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered from the Issan (northern Thailand area) part of the menu which offers foods with more spice kick.  I got the Ped Nom Tok, and the menu describes it like this:  Sliced boneless roasted duck home made with chili paste, herbs, spices & lime juice.  I asked for a spicy level of 4 out of 5.  It was spicy, but from my little array of spices, I added some extra red pepper flakes.  The dish was superb!  The mint that garnished the dish and the raw cabbage gave you something to cool your palate when the red pepper heat got to be a bit much.\n\nTime for dessert.  I had two things in mind.  Durian sticky rice or coconut ice cream.  I had been warned that the durian would cause horrendous breath.  Anthony Bourdain describes durian this way.  \"...Your breath will smell as if you'd been French-kissing your dead grandmother.\"  Since I was going to a show after dinner, I opted for the coconut ice cream.  It was the safer choice, and it was very good with some small chunks of coconut mixed in.\n\nI started dinner with a Thai iced coffee and I had an order of sticky rice.\n\nThe service was fantastic.  There were three ladies who were very attentive and answered a couple of questions I had.  I thought the one was going to say \"chicken\" when I opted out of the durian sticky rice dessert.  \n\nThe Yelp deal worked fine.  I paid $10 and received credit for $20 from Weera.  She took the code off my iPhone and asked me to mark the deal used which I did.\n\nAs I said before, this won't be a one time visit.  It is good, and I am a fan!!  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for letting me know this place exists."

Eggroll was standard, but decent. \n\nThe panang was good. I like the lime shreds on top for some aromatics and the curry sauce is thick and rich. If you like a more coconut creamy panang base then you'll probably enjoy the way they style the curry here. I like all kinds, depending on my mood and today the creamy style was agreeing with me.\n\nTofu pad thai had decent flavor, but it was too saucy. It had a mouthfeel closer to carbonara than stir fried noodles and neither of us were fans of it. Don't know if this is just the style they do or if it was a mishap. \n\nThe portion sizes, specially considering these are lunch specials, were very generous and come at a great price since lunch specials are $7-8. \n\nThai ice tea was a good sweetness to tea ratio. Best of all, during lunch they're only $1 as well as thai ice coffee and soda. They also have a happy hour for drinks and appetizers though I missed what time that was at.\n\nI can see potential in the food, but since one of our entrees was just alright, I think maybe a 4 is high. I will be back though as the dinner menu had some interesting Issan regional dishes and I can always be into curry!"

Duck is one of my favorite proteins, so you don't like duck, you can skip the rest of my review, but for those duck lovers out there, they keep the crispy skin on, and then pour delicious green curry all over it!! The mixed vegetables are the way to go as it makes the dish taste more fresh than a bunch of eggplant. We got everything at level 4 (out of 5) spice and it was very modest compared to other Thai restaurants in town. \n\nWe also ordered tom yum soup (first time trying it), and pad see ew. Tom yum is an interesting soup being sour (really sour. I was puckering at almost every bite) but I don't like spitting out all the random things in the soup that look innocent, but end up being crunchy (lemongrass?). It was listed at #8 on CNN's list of 100 foods to try before you die. I've tried it, and now I'll know not to order it again. Pad see ew was standard and mango sticky rice had a pretty sour mango for a $6 dessert, although the rice was cute in the shape of a heart. Service was sweet and they made sure to ask if we had any coupons before getting our bill so as not to waste time. \n\nIn summary: duck lovers, do NOT pass up the green curry with duck and mixed vegetables."

Some dishes are better than others so I'm just going to list which ones I've had.\n\nSample Appetizer Plate (Deep fried tofu, fried wontons, Thai egg rolls & chicken pot stickers) - I would not order this again. Everything was blah and not a lot of flavor.\nDuck Bone Soup - As stated in the name, it's mainly a lot of duck bones with broth. The soup itself tasted good but not enough meat for my tastes. I might try the pork rib soup once it's wintertime.\nNom Tok Moo - The pork is grilled but they let meat cool down to room temp before its served. Seasoned with rice powder, spices, lime juice and chili makes for a very tasty dish.\nKana Moo Krob - Basically, fried pork belly with chinese broccoli and oyster sauce. My favorite dish here especially since the pork belly was cooked to perfection. There's also another pork belly dish called Ka Pow Moo Krob which I can't wait to try.\nGreen Curry - It was wonderful but the best part of the dish is the eggplant!\nPad Kee Mow (Drunken Noodles) - Well executed ... no complaints here.\nCrab Fried Rice - Absolutely, not one piece or smidgen of crab in it. I should've sent it back.\n\nAccording to one of my friends, she thought the neighborhood is kinda sketchy but I have no problems returning especially if they are still serving the fried pork belly entrees!"

First off customer service was soooo bad. I asked for my coffee because my thai coffee had to much creamer. I literally had to ask 5 times. And when they finally brought it we were done eating and waiting on our check. Our table next to us was complaining on how long they have been waiting for a waitress to bring them there bill. At this time there is approximately 5 tables and 4 waitresses.\n\nThe tom yum chicken was really good! ANgel wings, Papaya salad, nam KAO, pork sausage and basil stir fry chicken was not all that great. Everything is sour and the basil stir fry is an authentic Thai dish and I would have thought that would have more flavors. \n\nIt gets worse *sigh* as the waitress was bringing our meal she pours the rice all over me!!! And breaks the bowl right next to me. Could you imagine if it was my soup? I didn't get an apology however what I did get was \"I didn't mean to do that\". I had rice on the side of my hair, on my pants and on my shoes. At this moment after waiting for some time, I became very frustrated. \n\nOverall customer service is very poor. Food quality is OK. However decor is very nice. \n\nI'm hoping when I do go back and give them one last try it will be better."

But then I drove past and saw that it serves Issan food and I though hmm, got to check it out.\n\nAs a lone diner I had just two dishes, the Issan green papaya salad (on the Issan menu, not to be confused with the \"regular\" papaya salad; the difference is extra fish sauce and an additional level of heat) and the Ped Nom Tak (duck.)  I asked for 4 of 5 on the spiciness scale and the chile in the papaya had me acting like a rat in a lab experiment, shocking myself again and again because I was so desperate for another bite. It was also a great value at $6.95 and I finished every last sliver.\n\nThe duck was the opposite, thank god, unctuous fork size bits of breast in a mysterious brown gravy. There was mint and garlic and what looked like ground rice but must have been crack, it was that good. Again, this lone diner finished the whole thing. Both the salad and the duck had a stack of squares of cabbage leaf in the corner of the plate, I assumed to use as a serving implement, but I needed something to soak up the heat and sop up the duck gravy so I ordered the sticky rice, a nice accompaniment.\n\nThis is a simple but pleasantly decorated restaurant with tablecloths under glass like a hundred other mom-and-pop Asian places you have visited. The service was attentive and friendly (though they had some trouble with the Yelp coupon, so pay attention to the bill). I was lucky enough to talk to the owner afterward and told him how happy he had made me. He was interested that I was in town for CES and hoped to get some more show-goers down his way. Since this was the last night of this year's show, he will have to wait for another day. I thought about those folks waiting 2 hours for a table down the street at Lotus. Their loss.\n\nUPDATE: Yelp contacted me asking me to specifically write about my experience with the Yelp deal. It was okay. I have the Yelp app on my Droid X and was able to access the deal there and show it to the server. She copied down the code number and asked me to mark the deal as \"used\" while she was watching which I did. Then the $20 discount initially did not show up on my tab and they had to rerun it which they did... simple miscommunication at the cash register. Bottom line, I think the Yelp deal worked fine and I'd happily use one again."

First we order chicken potstickers. For $5 we got 8 pieces, I was impressed because none of the other Thai restaurants would give you that many potstickers in an order. It was a bit salty but tasted pretty good. For the main dish we ordered chicken teriyaki and chicken fried rice. The food came out really fast since they weren't really busy. They put a lot of rice on the plate. I was happy this far until I got a bite of the chicken teriyaki. First of all there's not much you can do to ruin a teriyaki dish. It wasn't the flavor of the sauce that made me upset, but the fact that the chicken taste like spoiled meat. I made a complain to the waitress about the weird taste of the chicken. And she said that it was just different style of that region. Helloooo, do you think I'm stupid. I know that different region cooks the same food different way hence the different flavors. But no, the sauce taste just like plain teriyaki sauce, and that's not what I tasted on the chicken. I'm Asian and I crave for  good Asian food all the time. I'm not picky but bad Asian food just turns me off. As far as my husband, he's a white guy but an extremely good cook and cook many asian dishes better than most. He took one bite and pushed the food away. He knew the meat was rancid and ate no more. So when the waitress came back he told her that the meat was bad, and she said ok thank you. \n\nSo when I asked a different waitress to box my fried rice, I told her about the bad teriyaki chicken that we didn't touch, she told us she would check with the kitchen and the owner. After several minutes of waiting, we decided just to leave the cash on the table and don't even bother. As we were walking outside the restaurant, the first waitress came and asked us if we want thai tea to go for screwing up the order. My husband told her he's never coming back to the restaurant again, and her comment was ok thank you very much.  I told her I don't want any thai tea and how upset I was that she tried to convince me again about the different style. Come on! I could understand if maybe I didn't like the flavor, but Bad Meat is Bad Meat. Period. The fact that the owner keep defending the flavor of what I know is the weird taste of bad meat just pissed me off more than the food itself.\n\nWe eat out quite often. I give praise where it's due and complaints where it's due.\n\nSo will I ever come back here again? Absolutely not! There's so many good Thai restaurants in Vegas, and I wouldn't even consider this place as one of them."

The Tom Kah Kung coconut soup with shrimp and mushroom is a family favorite. The broth is so flavorful with fresh lemon grass, cilantro and kaffir leaves surely revive my senses! The pad see ewe with beef never disappoint. The sauce is not to sweet or salty. It always has a good portion of meat, noodles and Chinese broccoli.\nThe Happy Hour menu is another added bonus! The service is outstanding and always open to accommodation. Take advantage and call ahead since this place can get super busy! This place is overdue. You've earned my 5 stars!"

We ordered the Panang and Massuman curries and they were quite tasty and seemed a bit creamier than usual. The portions are huge and two people could share one curry and be full afterwards. A nice little Thai place just a couple miles off the strip."

Was my hubby's first time trying it, he's skeptical of seafood, but he loved it. Says it is his all-time favorite appetizer now. I ordered the Panang beef and it was yummy. Ordered it 5 out of 5 and it came out spicy though, honestly, I expected it to be a little spicier. Still good with fresh ingredients and nicely cut beef. Hubby got pork pad thai and it was also really good. Noodles were a good texture, sauce was perfect, veggies were crisp and pork was tender. We'll be back. If only they delivered further than 1 mile!"

Not even looking back, asking questions or wondering what I missed.\nBecause in my experience - I never really missed much.\n\nDon't get me wrong; I enjoy pads, tom kah kai, curries and papaya salad once in a while, and really, nothing is wrong with them. They are even quite good, most of the time. But what makes me really sad is that I KNOW that they are only the tip of the iceberg, and that there are many, many other treasures to be found. Well, eaten. But most places don't bother, or choose to \"hide\" these culinary pearls in secret menus that I am too scared to request upon ordering after being told once that they don't exist.\n\nBummer.\n\nNow you can lure me in anyway. And Weera Thai did just that, with the promise of Issan food. Northern Thai Issan cuisine is more sour and spicy than Central Thai food and is cooked in hot chili peppers, rice powder, served with sticky rice. The result? My nom tok which was thinly sliced grilled beef with rice powder, spices, lime juice and chili. Just to die for, and accompanied by the best tamarind-based sauce ever. There are a whole variety of similar dishes using beef, pork, duck and fish.\n\nNot in the mood for Issan?\nWhat about crispy pilot fish stir fried with Thai holy basil? Or ground pork stir fried with Thai holy basil & preserved duck egg? Or squid sauteed in a garlic, cilantro and pepper sauce?\n\nAnd for the least adventurous, Weeara does classics as well, and perfectly so. The simple spring rolls and the crab sticks we ordered were by far the best I have ever had. Fresh and vibrant - they redefined what they could be in the best of worlds. Wide rice noodles had just the right bite, and the green curry of my friend was outstanding.\n\nSkip Lotus of Siam, and come here. To top it all, service is absolutely darling!"

Our experience probably would have been better if I didn't have such high expectations, but it was still pretty good.  \nThe crab sticks ($8) we ordered didn't taste all that crabby.  The texture didn't resemble crab at all, and they had a pretty fishy flavor.  I would not order them again.\nBeef Pad See Ew ($9)  was pretty standard.  I forgot to ask them to make it without sugar (most Thai places go overboard), and was pleasantly surprised when it came out just the right amount of sweet.  \nWhat I really wanted to try here was the steamed sea bass, and that was actually better than I expected.  They have 3 varieties ($16 each).  1. Rice powder/chili/lime 2. Spicy sauce 3. Ginger.  The server recommended the spicy sauce one, so we went for it.  It came out in a soup bowl.  There was a very generous amount of broth, veggies, and the bass fillet on top.  The fish was super juicy, and flaky.  The broth was really tart, and delicious.  Perfect over rice.  \nThere was a lot of confusion when the check came.  That was a little annoying, especially since the restaurant was nearly empty.  The girl that brought the check forgot that we had a coupon, as did the girl we initially gave it to.  They reprinted it, but the amount was still wrong.  They reprinted it again, and we were finally able to pay.  \nA-ok just about sums up the experience in general, but I will be back for more sea bass."

So citrusy and refreshing with two large juicy shrimp, ground meat and red onion was on point and a great combination. My new favorite thai salad from now on. \n\nThe next starter we ordered was the bbq chicken with chili sauce. This was ok and tasty. We won't order this next time. \n\nFor our entrees, of course you can't eat Thai without ordering Tom Yum soup,  we ordered with shrimp only. By god, the shrimp in this soup are ginormous! I think there were 9 or 10 total. Each shrimp was like 3 mouthfuls. I have never went to a thai place that served shrimp this large anywhere! They were plump and juicy. The soup was level 3, it was super sour and spicy, just the way its supposed to be...I'm drooling again just thinking about it.\n\nWe ordered the red curry with tofu. This was mouthwatering. I absolutely loved the wide slices of bamboo and basil leaves, soo good. The tofu was plentiful and large as well. The curry was the perfect sweetness and the right amount of spice (level 2). Other places I've been to, were overly sweet with coconut, and was downright sickening sometimes. But they got it just right to balance with the other spicy foods we had.\n\nAnd last of all, we ordered the sliced beef salad. Compared to the glass noodle salad, this was just not as good in terms of citrus. It was a bit spicy because we ordered level 3. It kind of reminded me of Vietnamese banh mi pickled veggies. So we won't order this next time.\n\nBut I have to say overall, this experience was top notch. Believe it or not, this was all for only two people for around 50 bucks. Thats not bad for 5 dishes. Given, that the starters were 6 bucks each, a really good deal. Back in LA its 50 bucks for 3 dishes, and you don't get nearly as much food. We will definitely come here again for our Thai cravings :D"

The Thai Tea was only $1 at lunch.  They were located in a small strip mall on W Sahara Ave/S Valley View Blvd in Las Vegas. \n\nThe Tom Yum soup and the salad came out at the same time.  The soup was warm and was served in a tea cup.  The salad was of good size and had a ginger dressing.\n\nI ordered the Pepper Garlic Sauce Shrimp Thai Hot.  It came out at least 10 minutes before my friend's entree.  Awkward.  There were 6 shrimp with the tails on with carrots, mushrooms, green bell peppers, scallions.  There was no spice at all.  I had  to ask for a spicy tray.  The vegetarian egg roll was bland.  The amount of sauce with it was sparse and watery.\n\nMy friend ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry.  She ordered it mild and wished she had ordered it medium.  She took half of it home.  The server boxed the leftovers.  \n\nI wish I had ordered one of the curries, because it looked good.  I really enjoyed my Spicy Shrimp Salad that I ordered last time.  It had the appropriate amount of heat. I would not order the Pepper Garlic Sauce Shrimp again.\n\nI will give them another try."

And we found it! I thought the prices were quite reasonable for a thai food place, especially in Vegas but of course my mom and cousins thought it was a bit expensive because they're use to good cheap thai food. Sorry guys. We ordered soup to share which was really good but my cousin said a little bit spicy and it wasn't spicy at all, cream cheese wontons, chicken wings with sauce on the side, and other stuff I can't quite remember but everything was really good and had a great taste to it. \n\nMy favorite was the mussel cake or hoi todd which I thought was cooked perfectly. Not too crispy, not gooey at all, perfect texture, perfect sauce. I really enjoyed it and felt like it really hit close to home. \n\nOverall I would definitely suggest Weera Thai if I'm back in Vegas and my friends are craving authentic thai food."

It was empty when we arrived, but everything came out of the kitchen fresh and favorful. The staff was also very accommodating(my husband and I are vegetarian...so they were great about not including any fish sauce, etc. in the curries that we ordered.)\n\nMy husband had the red curry with tofu, which was yummy and I had the spicy eggplant with tofu. Both dishes were piping hot and served with rather large portions. We asked for both to be medium spicy and the spice was just right. The red curry had great cocounut flavor(wasn't overpowered by the coconut milk). Both dishes were served with rice. We had little doggy bags to take home because we coudn't eat anymore!\n\nI'm glad I found this place and it definitely satisfied our Thai craving."

The food was reasonable priced and plentiful. The chicken green curry came in one of those quart sized containers and was the perfect balance of coconut milk and spice. We also got a salmon red curry which was less successful but still delicious. The salmon was slightly overcooked and the portion was not as plentiful at the green curry.

The service was quick. I called them and reserved  a table in advance; hence the wait time was minimal. Even otherwise, there was no much crowd here (visited this place on a saturday night).\n\nThe next time I am in Vegas, I am sure I will visit this place again. \n\nI tried Spicy chicken fried rice and veggie fried rice. Both were excellent."

So we ordered from Were a Thai for the 1st time: GREAT lunch special, a entree, salad, egg roll AND soup. Yessssssss, all for $8.50 I was hooked. \n\nTo us born Americans Thai for is well known for PAD THAI and Weera Thai does not disappoint. Noodles are aldente, veggies are crisp, meat juicy and tender and peanuts on top CRUNCHY. We eat w/ our eyes right? The plate is very colorful, it's so fresh looking, steam rising from your pile of noodles, I wanted t dive in head first. Be careful when you order HEAT aka \"SpicYness\", I'm all about spicy food and then I met my match. I asked for a level of 5, thinking that it was going to be some type of mediocre heat, baaaaaaaaby I couldn't finished my food was so hot. My eyes got watery, nose started dripping and I started sweating. BUT I couldn't stop eating it was so good. \n\nIf you find yourself on Sahara/Valley View try out Weera Thai, if you are in fear of paying full price for something you may not like then go at lunchtime (you get a lot of food w/ the lunch special) or grab the Groupon or Yelp deal. If you are a foodie, you will definitely enjoy Weera Thai's food. By that's only my opinion, try it out yourself and see if your opinion about this place matches my opinion about this place."

Well because the shells are breaking into small peaces when (not carefully cooked) that can be mixed with the clam meat and when you chew it, it can really break your tooth. It happened to me with the whole serving and was truly disappointed because it was one of my most favorite food. Pad Thai is also going down the drain..\nThe older waitress with shoulder length haired has some kind of issue ether with me or she's just a b rude individual. She made me and my husband feel so uncomfortable when waiting to be seated which it takes a whiled, plus we have to always stand and look awkward when people are eating, just watching us stand there waiting for someone to appear and hopefully to help us. We are always so kind to all, and love the waitress with the short/short hair she's always kind and helpful beside the other one mentioned above. \nWe found this place a long time ago before any upgrades were ever made. It's unfortunate that the small, cozy, great food, and great customer service is diminishing by the minute. \nMy disappointment is so greatly and so upsetting to have been placed in such uncomfortable place due to the waitress that it's disgusting and needs to be taken cared of that issue. If she can't handle a busy place she needs to be out! \nWe will never be back to Weera:("

The subtle sweetness, creaminess, and spice is a good combination of flavors that always leaves me wanting more. Other notably good items is their satay, pad thai, and fried rice.\n\nWhere this place shines is their lunch special. A good selection of dishes for under 10 bucks. They also toss in a salad, soup, egg roll, and a side of rice. Even though its under 10 bucks, the entree portion is always filling, and it always has the taste of being made fresh. \n\nService is always good and the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are enjoying yourself and the food is good.\n\nMy only occasional problem with the place is that the meat that comes in the curry is sometimes overcooked and chewy.  But it doesn't happen often, and even when it does, the curry as a whole is still awesome, and the hot(temp) curry sauce helps soften up the meat.\n\nI have been going to this place for years, and I always look forward to going back.

The experience would have continued to be 5/5 for us, given that the food is delicious and the waiters were once very kind, helpful, and sincerely nice. However, our experiences since their renovation have been disappointing, and recently, incredibly frustrating due to the bad attitude and lack of customer service of the rude, curt female manager working. Our waitress was very sweet but did not speak English, so there was confusion when she asked if we wanted brown rice, despite the fact that they did not have any at the time. This was no problem when we received only white rice, because as two laid back people, we understand stuff happens. When taking our order, the waitress did great by asking what level of heat and what type of meat we wanted. However, she did not ask what type of tofu I wanted, like they had during previous visits, and I had not thought to tell her because it honestly had spaced my mind. This should have been a simple, easy fix, but the manager made sure that not only was I not going to get steamed tofu, but that she was going to berate and belittle me in front of my boyfriend and the other patrons of the restaurant by spitefully lecturing me at our table about the fact that I needed to specify, or else they are going to make me whatever they want. I have never been so rudely treated and embarrassed in my life. We were so disgusted by this woman at this point, having barely touched our food, that we requested to have our food to go. Instead of letting us pack our own food, the waitress took it all to the back. Upon arriving home, much later than we had intended on having a nice, relaxing meal, as if to add insult to injury, our packed meal had about 20% of the curry that we paid for in the small containers, which made the meal not even worth eating. I called and complained, to which naturally I was combated with lame excuses for their terrible actions. We will never go back there again. If I find out the name of said manager, I will edit and place her name so that you can request not to have her have any part of your dining experience."

Regardless, I think it's time for a review! \n\nI believe I found this place after searching for \"best thai food in vegas.\" It was listed among the top three along with Lotus of Siam & Komol so I had to give it a try after already trying the latter two restaurants. I am sooo glad I did because this has become one of my regulars/to go restraurants when I'm not sure what I'm really craving.\n\nYUM I don't think there is a single item on this menu that I don't like. I used to order the same items every time I came.. so much that when I forgot what it was, the waitresses would finish my order for me! Some of my favorites here are: the panang curry, the green curry, crab fried rice, and garlic squid. I won't get into each thing individually because I just don't feel that any words can do it justice, but will note that everything is always fresh and PACKED with flavor. Just think of a regular thai place and multiply the flavor by 5. So. Good. \n\nI also liked the pad thai. Normally, I don't like pad thai because I find it to be waaay too sweet or saucy, but this is really good. I've ordered it a few times for delivery to school and never had any complaints. Speaking of delivery-- they deliver to a pretty wide area including the strip! woohoo.\n\nMy all time favorite thing though would have to be the thai iced tea.. yes.. a drink! It tastes significantly different than thai iced tea from other places (other places tend to have a slight chocolate-y flavor which I'm not a huge fan of). It's hard to explain the exact taste... just trust me & try it! After all it is $1 or 50% off during lunch/happy hour I believe. \n\nThe service here is amazing. Everyone is very friendly. My only minor complaint is that the parking lot outside gets extremely full sometimes!"

I enjoyed the Pad Thai, it was a good sized portion and a great value. My brother didn't like the Mongolian beef enough to order it again, but left satisfied. Unfortunately, service was sluggish.

A friend recommended Weera, and in we went on a Thursday evening.\n\nHappy Hour menu of apps and half price drinks from 6:00-9:45PM, we opted for the fresh duck spring rolls ($8)- a huge portion served with a tasty marmalade-like dipping sauce. The rolls were packed with duck and fresh herbs, most notably the flavorful mint that other places skimp on or leave out all together. Definitely a dish I'd order again.\n\nNext we shared a hot pot of tom kha kai, which was delicious and boiling hot, packed with tons of chicken, cilantro, mushrooms, and ginger. Very flavorful, really hit the spot.\n\nBF chose the beef pad se ew entree, at the recommendation of our super-sweet server- and we were not disappointed. The noodles were super fresh and chewy, great texture that was almost like velvet. I haven't had fresher noodles since we were in Chinatown in the Bay area.\n\nLast, we opted to box up our entree leftovers and share a dessert: mango and sticky rice. It was plated beautifully, and the flavors were spot-on: mango was perfectly ripe, rice was warm and had the perfect texture, and the sweetness was not too overwhelming. \n\nService from both of the ladies working throughout our visit was top notch: drinks were refilled before they even got half empty, we were checked on repeatedly between courses, and they had radiant smiles on their faces every second. I've received lesser service at five-star with much higher price tags (and expectations). The service here was genuinely the absolute best I've had in recent memory- and their food was top of the line, too. Food is priced well: for all of the above, our bill was under $40 before tip. This is definitely a place we'll be back."

Even though I love the version of this dish at Archis and Pin Kaow who do it ground up, I always wanted to find a place who did it well with nicely sliced pieces of chicken.  Many times the restaurants that attempt it leave you with chunks of fat on the chicken still intact, or the slicing job looks more like Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw got a hold of it and not the fine carving skills of Michael Myers.  To summarize:  THIS CHICKEN WAS RIGHT!\n\nAnd I finally remembered to order brown rice!   Oh and the Egg Roll was fantastic.  \n\nHoping they can keep this up, they really earned this 5 stars today."

Kinda wish we did because our 3rd order came out cold (spicy duck) so we sent it back and decided to stick with the pineapple fried rice.\n\nGood thing I suppose because I had planned on using a $30 living social deal, but my friends used a groupon now deal and they refused to let us use both, even though it was separate checks and my friends came in and ordered way before we got there. They told us we could sit elsewhere and they would take it, otherwise the \"big man upstairs\" was watching and they would get in trouble if they took both. They were nice though and even asked if we wanted to still ordered which obviously we did, but it just turned into a big disappointment.\n\nLast visit we had similar issues (cold food that was overly salty which they tried to fix, but ended up tasting even worse, but they took it off the bill at least) and while the sea bass in garlic sauce was really good, the portion size and sticker price left us feeling like we should have just ordered more pineapple fried rice.\n\nUnfortunately I probably won't be coming back here if I can get a refund on my livingsocial coupon, otherwise it'll probably be the last time and I'll be just going to Pin Kaow from now on."

They are really welcoming and the water here must be extra filtered because it tastes just like bottled! My first time here, we ordered the pad thai, tom ka chicken soup, and I think it was the duck curry. The pad thai was not the best I've ever had...but it was good. The tom ka, was SO flavorful, but also really spicy. The duck curry is what hit the spot (even though my mouth was on fire) I would totally recommend this place to anyone and I would definitely return. \n\nNow let me tell you about my return visit, We ordered the pad thai again as well as the curry, but were craving dessert. We ordered the mango sticky rice and I think they had mistaken the mango sticky rice for regular sticky rice. Since this order was to go, I assumed they had it right because most to-go orders are pretty simple. I didn't bother checking once I got it since I was in kind of a hurry. Unfortunately, I didn't trust my gut when I went in and told them what I ordered, because when I told them what I had gotten, the employees looked at each other and said \"uhh three items right.\" For that reason I'm a little grumpy with this place which is why I am only giving them three stars."

I wanted to find an authentic fare, and became intrigued after reading several reviews about their Issan cuisine. The squared-shaped interior started with center tables vertically arranged, followed by booths, wall-to-wall cultural artifacts, TV, and a small bar in the back. The atmosphere was casual with lots of foot traffic throughout the day.\n\nThe Khor Mee Yang ($9.95) arrived with strips and pieces of marinated charbroiled pork nicely blackened on the ends. The mix of tender charred, lean, and fatty textures was highly addictive, but the marinade and spicy tamarind sauce could have been better, as the level of spiciness was not as robust as I like it to be.\n\nThe Khao Pad Pla Salid ($9.50) included a huge portion of fried rice filled with deep fried salid fish, basil, and peppers. The fried rice carried a decent airy texture. Too much fish sauce made it too salty to my liking, but the fried fish was crispy, moist, plentiful, and nicely flavored. The server initially described this dish as \"spicy fried rice.\" However, we didn't find a hint of heat even after we had requested these dishes to arrive Thai spicy.\n\nOverall, portions were excellent with discernible authentic flavors. However, the level of spiciness was the absent element that could have advanced the flavors further. Contrary to other reviewers' account, our service was timely, attentive, and friendly. I would be interested in returning to give them another chance."

The Eggplant had a good kick to it, but delicious and is great to have as a veggie dish.\nThe Crabstick appetizer is very popular because we originally ordered it to start with, but they were out.

The duck was savory but you're caught unexpected with the sourness of the initial flavor.  The yummiest dish was the clams. It was awesome and had I known, I would've ordered two orders of the clams.  I ordered the spice level at a 2 for my coworker but the dishes would've been better at a 3.  The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable. I had paid $10 for a $20 groupon so the value of the meal was awesome for what I paid."

It is prepared like a traditional papaya salad, but in the place of the thinly sliced papaya, you get to devour mango. And, I think it is far superior to papaya. The thoughtfulness, creativity and cravability of this dish is a perfect representation of Weera. I have had numerous notable Thai standards, like the green curry, but they really stand out by always having a little twist on the standards that are equally, if not more, delicious."

Whenever I'm looking for a new Thai restaurant I always look for Misty Y and Dan P's reviews, once I see that they give it a good rating I am ready to try it out.  \n\nI had the Spicy Basil with Chicken lunch special, spicy level 3 out of 5 and thought it was spiced perfectly for my taste.  Usually some restaurants will either under spice or over spice when asking for a middle of the range level, but this was perfectly spicy will not making me reach for water after every bite.  The flavors on the dish were also spot on.  You dont get too much but for $6 I couldnt complain.  \n\nI cant wait to come back and try their duck dishes.

            "review": "I like to judge Thai Restaurants based on how well they make Pad Thai. I mean, that's basic enough, right? I mean, if a restaurant can't make a good pad thai what makes you think their other food is going to be up to par? So... I did just that. \n\nFirst time I tried their pad thai, and I thought \"Wow... This is better than most restaurants in Vegas.\" It was saucy, tangy, sweet, with the right amount of noodles with the condiments provided. So, I thought, \"I want to try this place again!\" \n\nThe second time around wasn't the same as the first, or the third, fourth, or even fifth. Is it just me or most Thai restaurants just can't get Pad Thai right? Overall, it had a hint of tang, but in terms of a good balance between, salty, spice and sweet, they just couldn't get. And in most cases, the noodles are a bit over boiled, that they tend to stick together as if adhered by dull glue. So,sometimes when I'm in the mood for Pad Thai, I would cross my fingers and hope that they make it good this time around. Why would a customer even have to do that? \n\nBut of course, I'm not going to base my review with just one entree. I thought that maybe, pad thai isn't their forte. So, I tried the next best thing which is pad see ew. This was just worse than the pad thai. While I thought that the latter lacked flavor, the pad see ew, I ALWAYS shoo away from because the first time I got it, it was a blob of salted noodles colors light brown. I could pick up the noodle and I swear they would probably stick together shaped like a brick. Not only that, it was also over boiled, and was left sitting for a while (because we ordered for delivery), and tasted a bit dry. It was so bad, that I traded this nasty dish for a mediocre pad thai. \n\nI've also tried their yellow curry, and I have to say that it's not something that you'll remember.  It's a pretty basic curry with a pretty good kick of spice, but the chicken, potatoes, carrots, and other veges looked like it was just thrown in with the base that it hardly caught it's flavor. Did prepared the veges and meat separately and have a base for curry somewhere else and put it together? I really would like to think that they didn't. I'm not saying that the curry is bad. I think it's pretty average compared to other restaurants in Vegas. \n\nOnce of the latest entree that I tried from there was the Spicy Chicken Basil. I ordered it because it was in their lunch special, and from other restaurants, I've had a pretty good experience with many. Chicken was bland, but the sauce was flavorful. Again, the part about the chicken and veges... Did they boil that separately in a big batch and just put together with many of their orders? I was a bit disappointing with the portion considering that it wasn't an entree that made me say \"wow\". \n\nThen, the last thing I got their was their pineapple fried rice. Okay, I gotta give it to them on this one. This was pretty damn delicious and a huge portion. I think next time I go there (in the circumstances that my friends would want to go here again), I would order this as the safest thing that I can eat and actually like. \n\nIt would be horrible of me to say that this is a two out of five because this place is a hit and miss for me. I've had good days in which the entrees I've ordered was good enough for me to enjoy, but I also had days when I was left disappointed. So, overall I want to say... It's not bad, but it's not great either."

I would always eat here and it never made me sick but since it has reopened I have ate here 3 times and got sick every single time. This last time it gave me food poisoning and I'm currently dealing with that now, up all night throwing up. Also this place made 4 other people I know sick with food poisoning as well. Usually places will give you a bad meal once and it's over with but now there has been MULTIPLE different cases of actual food poisoning ever since Weera opened back up. I'm not sure if they had their health inspection or not but someone needs to get in there and see what the hell is going on. I'm extremely upset with this place and will never go back or eat Thai food again. I have never been so sick in my entire life or had food poisoning. All I ordered was pad Thai which I get at any Thai restaurant and it's always fine, but there's clearly something wrong going on in the kitchen. My friends ordered the sweet chili basil and different curries and got food poisoning too. We all had to go to the doctor because it was that severe. I do not recommend this place,  unless you want to be sicker than you've ever been before. Disgusting, unsanitary and the kitchen needs to be inspected. This is not cool. Be careful if you do decide to go here."

It's very comfortable and clean on the inside.  \n\nWe all got the lunch special and ordered thai ice tea which was a 1.50 more with the special. We all agreed that the thai ice tea was too sweet and needed to be watered down. I think I poured half my water into the tea. All I can think about was... Man me running uphill for a mile this morning is the equivalent of 1/3rd the calories in this tea. \n\nI ordered the pad Thai and my friends had a variety of stuff... The pad ke pow, curries etc. I liked my pad Thai. It's on the sweeter side but it's saucy and hits the spot. I also liked my friends dishes as well. The curry was rich with heavy coconut hints. Everything  was very flavorful. The lunch special also gives you a general portion of leafy green salad... Not that iceberg lettuce situation some other restaurants give, and a bowl of delicious Tom yum soup.  \n\nYou can pick the spicyness levels of the food from 1 to 5. My friends got a level 5 for their curry but it wasn't too bad. You can definitely taste it in the end and it stays with you for a bit but I can handle it and I usually go for a medium or mild. \n\nI was very satisfied with the meal and will definitely be back."
