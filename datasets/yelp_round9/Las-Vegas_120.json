We end up here due to the wait time at the other restaurant. \n\nI gots to say the rolls were meh, nigiris were even worse, sushi was far from fresh, and just everything they had was not too impressionable. I was quite disappointed with my meal here and the best thing about this place is probably the great service. Waiters and staff were all super friendly and nice. \n\nI'm giving some stars cuz of service but I could do without this place for sushi. :/"

The restaurant itself is a small, quaint place not a ton of seating but when we arrived we got sat right away. It did fill up quickly however so I'm going to chalk it up to good timing. \n\nWe intended to just go in for a few rolls but then we realized they had AYCE so why not. The AYCE menu is a smaller than some other AYCE menus offered at some near by sushi restaurants but pretty comparable to the type of sushis. The sushi was pretty fresh and came out fairly quick, which is a plus because nobody likes to wait too long in between orders.\n\nService was definitely one of the best I have had in any restaurant. I think the server was the owner or maybe manager, either way he was on top of it in every way! He made my son laugh a lot so that was another plus!"

Once we even received a free roll that had been made by mistake. The beer on the happy hour menu is cheap and a big bonus if you enjoy a drink with your food. Little out of the way for most but definately worth a try if you love nearby."

That being said, we did enjoy all the rolls and appetizers (especially since I'm from Hawaii) we ordered. I like the fact they offer AYCE as that gives you the opportunity to try everything. Also, the price is comparable to other AYCE Sushi restaurants ($26.95 for dinner). It's a good spot, but just not my favorite. Definitely give it a whirl if you're in the area and in the mood for sushi!"

Waited a good 15 mins To order sushi however the sushi chef was busy and looked like he didn't want to be interrupted.  We had to literally demand him to take our order, he didn't even acknowledge us. The nigri orders are extremely small and for the price I expected a lot more.  Yellowtail didn't even seem sushi grade.  We were so fed up with waiting that just got the tab and left."

Our fault. Later that day, we came back and again had to wait 1.5 hours so we just decided to order to-go. haha. We used the Groupon (20 for 40) to order the widow roll, 2 salmon skin hand rolls, a cali hand roll, seafood yakisoba, and beef don for 3.50 extra\n\n- Long to-go order wait. 1.5hr \n- Widow roll: soft shell crab with avocado. lots of avocado. more soft than crispy shell. I'd get the 808 special instead\n- Salmon skin: Stuffed with salmon skin. More skin than salmon! Tasty! More! :)\n- Cali hand roll: more imitation crab than the roll. less rice\n- beef don: Almost tastes like yoshinoya. lol \n- UFO Instant Yakisoba with seafood pieces from the sushi\n- I suggest coming here during their happy hour only for a deal. 7-9pm fri and sat even drinks! Perfect :)\n- Go to 808 tapas"

Now as far as the food it's good quality and always fresh! I only come during happy hour and I always get the garlic chicken which is full of flavor and very tender plus it's only $2.95 I believe which is craziness! I also order the crunch roll which is like 3 bucks and I order the deep fried Cali roll which is delicious and also costs like 2.95. So I end up getting 3 different items for the price of 1 roll at every other sushi place. \n\nGood sushi\nGood service \nGood prices \n\nCan't go wrong here!"

Happy hour its always busy and they open at 4:00pm their will be a line waiting to get in. Food is good their 808 signature roll is the best. Prices are reasonable and you can also choose all you can eat just not with the groupon the happy hour and all you can eat do not apply with coupons. My daughter age 11 even ate sushi their and she normally hates fish so when I say its good its good. Only thing I would change is the music for an hour and 1/2 I had to listen to rap music as a business owner myself I would choose something that is more suitable felt like I was in a night club not a sushi restaurant."

I'm a pretty generic sushi lover, meaning I'm not huge on sashimi and I like the sweet, tempura and fried rolls that appeal to most everyone; so with that said, this roll appeals to my taste.

            "review": "For me 808 sushi has the best AYCE in town. Now I know there are so many AYCE and gosh knows everyone has their favorites. Personally the things that makes it stands out above the rest is the appetizers or pupu selection for one. They have things that cater too the 808 style like kalbi action, tonkatsu style pupu, and way they cook it all local style. The quality of the fish is top notch for me everything tastes fresh and looks awesome. The speciality rolls have nice diversity too them. I enjoy the spicy pele, dragon roll for me automatic, and LOTS LOTS of nigiri ones. \n\nThe wait staff is very friendly and on top of it. I must admit that they forgot about one round (I went with roommate dinner bday celebration) but going four five rounds lot too write down. Lol! The only true thing pick at is if the place is busy (its hit or miss but sure weekends they do well) don't expect the sushi too come flying at like other AYCE sushi. They only have two sushi chef at most so full house been too might take time. Still think worth it plus you can relax more enjoy the pupus!\n\nThe place has bunch of tvs. Monday night football not ask for more sushi on and watch MNF. The owner is from Hawaii so all about support another local boy! Roots."

We had good timing, no wait, and they were having a \"happy hour\" with selected items including sushi for great prices.  I love anything with spicy tuna and I immediately picked out a few rolls.\n\nEverything came fresh, made as we waited, the initial order, I believe included about six items, came rapidly.  We loved the garlic chicken, shrimp tempura, Ahi Poke, and the mochiko chicken.  I loved \"da kamikazi\" roll, the dragon roll, Haleakela and Hawaiian style roll.  \n\nWe had those things eaten quickly and eagerly picked another round.  The whole time, the place was filling up with more customers.  But we still continued to get fast service.  \n\nWe enjoyed everything and certainly would make this a regular sushi favorite."

It's not the first time we've been here as the food here is quite good and is quite evident by the fact that there is a half hour line waiting to be seated.\n\nUnfortunately, while the food on the appetizer menu is quite tasty and their sushi is average, the service tonight was below average.  Our server was busy and as attentive as she could be, but the issues were rather with the items on the menu which were out of stock / not available.  While she informed us of both the hamachi kama and salmon kama being out, she failed to let us know that the uni (quite possibly one of the best items on the menu) was also unavailable as their vendor didn't have any in stock to deliver.  We found out about the lack of uni when she came by to ask what we would like for dessert as all of us were anticipating another plate of sushi to be delivered to the table.\n\nNow let me explain...  I could have totally understood this if there was some mention made of this before or while we were putting in our initial order.  I could have even been okay with this (although disappointed) if this was mentioned in the middle of dinner.  Instead, my family waited in anticipation for a plate of uni nigiri and was instead greeted with the information at the near end of our meal.  Uni itself is sea urchin and is definitely not for everyone.  No matter where you order it, you will either love or hate it.  For some I think it's a consistency issue.  In the case of my family, we love it!  We have actually walked out of other sushi bars here in Las Vegas because they didn't have any.  Las Vegas has many sushi bars and almost limitless choices of great food.  \n\nOver the past few years, we have actually followed the owner of this establishment from other places he has co-owned or worked at as the food has always been good.  Tonight when my father approached him about the lack of uni, he seemed dismissive and quite unapologetic to the point where my father was going to leave an 8 cent tip on the check to get his message across that perhaps in this economy that service and humility toward your customer can only get you ahead while the adverse will get you the opposite.  I left an additional $20 with the check (and my father's 8 cents).\n\nThe sushi here is okay.  I actually drive a cab and have been recommending this establishment whenever I'm asked in person or on the dispatch radio about a sushi bar.  The items on the appetizer list are awesome and I definitely recommend the Garlic Chicken and Tako Karaage.  Tonight was just an unfortunate experience and I definitely feel that the situation could have been handled differently.\n\nI'll be back again in the new year and hope that things are better."

We crave their 808 special roll and with 50% off for happy hour, it's definitely a treat.  Their Miso Black Cod and Kalbi is also very good if your doing AYCE @ dinner time.  The staff is nice and they are all 808 fsho.  I'd recommend this place for anyone looking for top notch sushi."

            "review": "Located in Summerlin (west of the 15, off the 215).  I used to hate AYCE places - until I came to 808.  I stopped by here on my latest trip to the Ninth Island (Vegas), based upon my yf Lisa S' review (from Vegas).  I also wanted to support my Hawaiian bruddahs.  Lisa S' review was spot on with 4 Stars.\n\nAs opposed to the food laying out like most AYCE places, they make the food to order.  At $26.95 and $3 for a large Japanese beer or $1 sake during HH, its a good deal.  My friend and I ordered the following from the app menu:  Ahi and he'e (tako) poke; garlic chicken; salmon kama (no hamachi kama that night); tako karaage; fried smelt and miso black cod.  From the sushi menu we ordered kani; salmon skin handroll; unagi handroll; soft shell crab handroll and two futomaki rolls (Maui and Da Hawaiian - she ordered these not me - lol). \n\nOverall, the appetizers were very good.  The ahi poke was fresh and flavorful.  The only thing I would change was adding more limu.  The he'e (tako) version was, eh, so-so.  It needed more shoyu and limu.  The garlic chicken was as advertised - nice and garlicky and not greasy.  The salmon kama was fresh and silky as this part of the fish should be.  The he'e karaage melted in your mouth!  The he'e was so fresh.  The fried smelt were nice and crunchy - Kind of like anchovies, but bigger.  But the best of all was the miso black cod.  OMFG - Broke Da Mouth!  It was buttery smooth and oh so fresh!  I wanted to order more, but I abstained because I didn't want to ruin my tastebuds.\n\nThe sushi was pretty good too w/ the exception of the rolls.  The kani was ok for what it was.  I should have known it was fake crab.  The rolls were for primarily for my friend so, I only had a bite.  They were not to my liking - I guess I am old school and I have not fallen for the sushi roll craze.  The hand rolls were fresh, huge and creative.  The salmon skin was nice and crunchy.  The unagi came w/ avocado (I have never had it this way). The avocado gave it a creamy finish.  The soft shell crab came w/ a salad made from the crab meat - How creative!  It was very good.\n\nSince I ate most of the apps, hand rolls and drank most of the beer, I didn't have dessert.   My friend didn't have as much, so she ordered the banzai bowl - vanilla ice cream w/ a small apple turnover and chocolate topping.  The other options are vanilla and green tea ice cream or 3 flavors of frozen mochi.  She really liked the dessert.  \n\nShaka to my bruddahs for good food, that is made to order and AYCE.  It was Da Kine!"

We used a groupon on a couple 2 item combos and soft shell crab appetizer. The combos included a ton of food, I think their garlic chicken is even better than island sushi's since its spicier. \n\nFood was quick and service attentive, but don't bother with the soft shell crab if you're doing ala carte. It's not worth $9 for 2 teeny crabs. Writing this, I actually just realized that when we did ayce last time they said they were out of soft shell crab for appetizers, but we got spider rolls. So they're liars too. Nice... \n\nI will still never be back for their sushi, or attempt the frustration of going there for dinner, but I'd probably go back for the garlic or mochiko chicken entrees."

This used to be my go-to sushi place close to the house but no more.\n\nThe kid and I both had the AYCE and I don't think it was worth it. He loves rolls and I'm more soups, salads and apps. All the rolls were fair; I would give it 3 stars. But the sides, ooooh the sides were so dissapointing. Up first, kalbi ribs. An order consisted of ONE rib sliced into 5 pieces. That part didn't bother me and flavor was fine but it was so incredibly chewy Mr. Ed couldn't even break it down. There was no way to even swallow it after a minute of chewing so I just spit it out. Yea that bad. The potstickers had no flavor. I don't know if it was prepackaged and cooked on sight but I can't possibly believe some company made this to sell and people actually buy it. Last but not least was the salmon kama. I love any kind of kama with hamachi being a favorite. But this wasn't even edible! It went beyond just a \"fishy\" taste. I believe it was actually spoiled. It just had that spoiled fish smell and flavor. I think the waitress knew what was up because she was so quick to apologize. \nI've had bad food but don't believe I've ever had spoiled seafood :-(\n\nSadly won't be returning to this neighborhood joint unless it seriously turns a new leaf."

I've been here twice and could not find a better sushi place that does their Salmon Skin Hand Roll as well as 808 Sushi.  They also offer Hamachi Kama, Salmon Kama and Miso Glazed Black Cod for AYCE so that's another bonus.  \n\nService can be overly attentive, but i guess that's better than no service.  Could be bad timing too because every other bite i took they were asking if i needed anything, and there's a whole lotta chewing going on.  Eating is no joke.\n\nWould def come back here if my buddy invited me to eat or vice versa. \n\n3.5"

            "review": "Out of all the sushi joints that I have been to, I am surprised that I did not yelp about this place. \n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity of my friend raving about 808, I made her go try it out with me. We went for lunch, because I am a beast and was sure I would regret eating so heavily at night. Instead I would gorge myself and pretend that my body would burn off all the calories during the rest of the day. Although we did not get the full menu, the lunch list was more than adequate.\n\nWhen we entered the restaurant, it did not look like anything special. There is nothing that stands out in comparison to any other place. \n\nWhat it lacks in appearance, it makes up for in taste. For appetizers, the tako karaage, agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, and ahi poke are amazing. In fact, I am sure my friend and I could eat our money worth in the last two items. \n\nThe main reason why I like this place is because they do not overload a roll with rice. The sushi comes out a little smaller than most places, but that is a good thing. It has been so long since I have been here that I forget the names of the rolls. When I go back, I will write out an in depth list. My biggest issue is with the use of soft shell crab. I prefer that it be whole, but at 808 they mix the meat with another fish and sauce. Half the pleasure of soft shell crab is to eat the exterior of the creature. On a positive note, the fish is fresh and you can taste it in the nigiri. I love hirame( fluke, sometimes called halibut), unagi (eel), ahi (tuna), tako (octopus), and sake (salmon). They are all basic, but essential sushi. \n\nThe staff is friendly and quick, but as our meal was wrapping up the service took a turn. In my mind, it was because they wanted to keep us there and not let us leave. It was the weirdest experience. Usually people give you the bill and just as quickly take it to rush you out. Instead we were left sitting there being asked by the chefs if we wanted more.\n\nIf you are not an AYCE type then go during happy hour for half off all cut rolls and beer. Monday through Friday from 3pm-6:30pm."

This is actually our second time here and we went during their summer happy hour - a menu of 1/2 off of rolls and pupus or hors dourves.  \nI love poke, a Hawaiian dish of usually ahi tuna with spices, onion, and sometime macadamia nuts.  Now if you go to Hawaiian grocery stores, (Daiei), they will have 10-15 varieties of poke.  I usually love salmon poke.\nSo 808 Sushi gets 2 stars for going out of their way to make salmon poke for me!  (Hubby had the ahi tuna poke)\nThe other star goes to how big a bowl of that salmon poke that was for only $5.00!  I could not finish it.  (Maybe because I ate it with a half a bowl of rice).\nWe also had the spicey scallop roll which was very good.\nThe last star I gave was to their long john pastry and mini Hawaiian cakes or cupcakes of dobash, haupia and guava.  Yummers!  Bakery goods come at 11:30 a.m. every day...\nI am sure we will be here again...!"

The sushi chefs are very friendly.  My only issue and why I didn't give five stars is there service.  The trick to 808 is to just ask for what you want.  The waitresses go off in the corner and chat so if you need something, you will need to call them to you. So we order like 2 of the dollar sakes because we don't know how long it will take to get the next one. I think becoming regulars they know us now so they are more attentive. But you can't beat dollar sakes and 2.75  dollar rolls."

There's no designation as to whether this menu item is raw or baked so I assumed that it would be similar to other scallop/mayo sushi items at other sushi restaurants in that it would be baked. Not so here. It didn't taste very good (texture of the raw scallop with mayo mixed in....blech). \n\nOther than that small mishap everything else was awesome. Will definitely be back :)"

There are a bunch of expressionless Koreans that draw their eyebrows on serving us. If that's what you want to call it. \n\nBy far the worst service I have ever received here. No one stops to refill drinks, ask how everything is going, or if they can get us anything else. You have to flag them down and ask for more food and drinks. Also is it that hard to smile? We're not in North Korea. Even though it looks like it.\n\nThis place has really let itself go. The quality of food has gone downhill dramatically. The girl that seems to be running this place is definitely under qualified and too worried about what's on her phone then what's going on in the restaurant. \n\nYou need to get your local staff back. Because what you got going on now is a definite let down to the local community. You were one of a handful of 808 eateries that represented well. You had the name, the food, and majority of your staff was actually local. Just cause you lived in Hawaii doesn't make you local either. It's in the heart and there's no heart there."

Ate at the bar and I opted to do ala carte because I usually don't eat much. Chef Lee made my rolls and he was a great guy! Very friendly and nice. Ordered an Alaskan roll and Kilauea roll. Finished both and left full and satisfied. Bill was only $11 for two rolls; can't beat this price! Knocked off a star cause the dynamite mix on top of the Kilauea seemed a little off to me.. loved that the Alaskan had ikura on top,  yum."

Overall all i can say was what a bad experience. \n\n    From the start i called to make a reservation as stated on the  Groupon but was told no reservation needed. As my friend and i walk in 808 sushi the only available seating was the sushi bar and a table next to the door, we took the table next to the door even though we were already cold. ( the table wasn't cleaned off). As we waited for them to clean off the table i look around and it seemed cold and dark, not a welcoming place.\n    The server asked if we were doing happy hour or groupon, we told her groupon and she handed us the menu for the Groupon. :(. I was very dissapointed about the menu, i expected more variety of Rolls and appetizers. After ordering we over heard a table talking about still being hungry and complaining about waiting over 15min for their check. \n      When it was our time to get our check we waited less than 10 min. We order 2 California rolls, 808 Roll, 6 piece Screaming orgasm , miso soup, shrimp tempura. total was$ 48.75 with Groupon discount it came to $8.75. I gave them $20.75 after waiting another 10min for my change back i got back only $9.75 :/ ya i was confused for a moment myself (i guess they wanted to take some of their own tip out of my money first). honest mistake maybe !!! . But we were cold and to disappointed to stay any longer. Wont be returning !!!!!"

The place was packed so I thought, \"Must be a good sign, right.\" There was one empty table, but the hostess didn't even move and just pointed it out to us and said, \"You can just sit over there.\" \n\nFood here gets no love from me. We ordered 2 orders of negitoro and salmon hand rolls, combination plate w/ 2 entrees (garlic chicken & miso black cod) which is supposed to come with miso soup, salad, rice, and dessert. We also got a spider roll. Let's start with what I liked, which was the miso black cod. I thought it was delicious and cooked just right. I would order this again. Unfortunately, I can't say the same with the rest of our orders. The garlic chicken was so greasy and just didn't look right. I had garlic chicken before from 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate which I loved, so I was expecting it to resemble that but I was let down. The salmon hand roll is ok. I had better at a Korean/Sushi/Chinese place we dined at yesterday. The negitoro was worse. It was basically just tuna sliced in cubes with scallions hurriedly put on top. The spider roll was the worst thing I've ever eaten in a long time: completely drenched in sauce that it completely fell apart when I barely picked it up with my chopsticks. I had a small bite and quickly put it back to the plate. The dessert never came to our table so I cannot comment on it. \n\nAt this point I just want to leave and move on so we asked for the bill. Our combo plate was supposed to be $14.95 but we were charged $29. They could have thought we ordered 2 combo plates but our bill specifically stated: 1 Combo B: $29.99. I pointed it out and the lady apologized and fixed the mistake right away. I'm just glad I caught it while we were still there. Needless to say I am not coming back."

We brought in our own cakes which wasn't a problem either!\n\nI think we had everything on the menu (or very close to it!) at least once.  My cousin even ordered two bowls of curry and rice . . . but it was his birthday so I didn't give him too hard a time! We did a little bit of sharing and tasting amongst each other, but here's my favorites:\n\nmiso black cod - AMAZING!!\nahi poke (wonderful, even if frozen - we asked, they were honest!)\ngarlic chicken\nhamachi kama - Uncle said this was the best ever!\n808 roll\nda kamikaze roll\nnatto nigiri - MMMMMM!!!  \n\nOne missing thing though was the baked green mussels and fresh oysters, neither was on the menu.  But there were so many other delicious options, we didn't miss it at all.\n\nLots and lots of mochi ice cream for all -- mango, strawberry, chocolate and coffee.  And generous scoops of green tea ice cream, plus cake!!  We were rolling out the door with full bellies and happy memories!!"

If you need more wine, water, a drink, I have had to ask multiple times.  They will stand in the corner chatting away.  Dont expect your check, you will have to ask for that too. It sucks, because I live in the neighborhood next door and my friends drive a few streets over to another place because they don't the service in 808. If they could get great servers this would be a five star deal to me. You cant get a better deal on sushi anywhere when it comes to their happy hour."

I've never gotten sick or had any issues with their sashimi or raw foods. They are perfectly made, and made with really cool artistic decorations and great combinations. (Not your nooby typical spicy mayo, crab, and avocado rolls)\n\nI love the location of this place because it's very close to my house so it is very ideal. The restaurant is very clean, and designed quite well. Very Japanese feel to it and the tables are really cute. The staff are always really nice and welcoming. Definitely a good sushi spot!"

Both very flavorful and delicious! For our main entrees, we ordered the 808 special, Dragon roll, Tiger roll and Tempura roll. The sauce of the rolls is pretty good as its a combination of sweet with just a tiny kick! \n\nIt's also great coz aside from the HH, they have AYCE sushi! Lunch is $20.95 while dinner is $24.95.

Well, they most certainly can at 808 Sushi!\n\nWe're from Hawaii, so trying to find fresh fish here has been very tasking!  It took us 2 1/2 years to finally discover this place, which is on the far west-side of the Strip, Mountain's Edge.  I mean, we've done Sushi Mon several times before, but I can't help but get the feeling of it being so \"tourist-y\" over there.  Here at 808 Sushi, the feeling is a little more \"local\" in style, and you don't get that hurried, stuffy feel from the staff either.  Despite the bar-ambience at 808 Sushi, I still find this place to be very family-friendly as well.\n\nThe AYCE is fantastic!  We had to at least dine here for both the lunch and dinner AYCE before we could review for the place with a clear assessment.  Lucky us!  Lunch AYCE is $20.95, my daughter eats free, she's 4.  The dinner AYCE is $24.95, again daughter eats free, while my elementary-school son eats for $12.95.  He could have eaten a la carte off the menu, but we know his growing appetite by now.  Next, we need to try their Happy Hours, Monday thru Friday 3pm-630pm, Friday and Saturday 9pm-11pm.  I hear it's half off certain menu items and their beer, plus $1 hot sake.\n\nAll their nigiris are ono!  I don't need to list all of them, so just know that they ALL are delicious!  Yes, they are smaller in cut, but it's all you can eat.  So, therefore:  Eat All You Can.  Hah!  I've tried their special rolls too, which, although tasty, I've never been a huge fan of these \"mainland-style\" rolls anyhow.  Despite my particular sushi style preferences, I did enjoy their Da Kamikazi roll, tempura, soft shell crab, eel, and salmon.  But, in the end, all I want is nigiri sushi!\n\nTheir hot menu is great too!  Their lunch is a modified, limited version of the dinner one.  I have to mention their Mochiko Chicken!  Soooo crunchy and tasty!  The kids had 3 orders!!!  Also worth mentioning, their Ahi Poke is quite flavorful for such a small portion, but it packs just the right punch (keep ordering, if you like it that much!).  Other notable items are the Agedashi Tofu, Garlic Chicken, Miso Black Cod (Butterfish), and Tako Karaage, just to name a few.\n\nAnd lastly, I have to say that the staff here is super friendly and warm-welcoming.  This is THE definite contrast to the staff at Sushi Mon.  Again, Sushi Mon seems to hurry you through, yet take their time w/your orders.  They unfortunately don't do a terrific job at explaining their \"limits\" and \"restrictions\" on their AYCE menu.  But, at 808 Sushi, with just a few \"restrictions\" to your order, they explain it well enough here and are much more friendlier about it too.  This is probably due to their laid-back approach on their service and their customers, which by all means does not mean their service is lackluster.  It just means their friendly Aloha attitude makes your experience here that much better!"

You can also get all the appetizers you can eat, many of which are really good - ahi poke, garlic chicken, etc. If you don't do AYCE, they do have happy hour and you can get $1 sake and half price rolls.

It's just marked to show which dishes are made with raw fish. They should really label that soon... Now because this is all cleared up, this is now my absolute FAVORITE sushi joint to go to again!! I love this place. :D"

They also have the usual AYCE lunch and dinner, but your best bet is that happy hour... half off all sushi and $1 hot sake (M-F 3-6:30pm and Fri/Sat nights from 9-11).  Atmosphere is decent, basically just a bunch of tables in a large room with some flat screens (definitely wish they had booths).  Service is great, and they do takeout.  Favs include the 808 special (soft shell crab topped with spicy tuna) and the 007 roll (cali roll topped with shrimp, avocado, and eel sauce).  Easily one of the best happy hours in town, especially if you live in the Rhodes Ranch area."

They have a pretty decently sized selection of full rolls from $3-$8. We ordered two unagi rolls, a Philadelphia roll, and a Maui special. (I used to go here before and the Maui special was one of my favorites. Yesterday, the Maui special was the best tasting out of all of them but it still just didn't deliver.) The Philadelphia roll was okay and we were actually only given one unagi roll even though we ordered two so we shared the roll and I actually felt bored eating it. There was no flavor at all. It tasted like I was just eating rice. \n\nAt the end, we were still charged for two unagi rolls and we almost didn't catch the extra charge. One of the servers (there were three different people helping us the entire time) apologized for the extra charge but didn't offer a refund, just offered that we took it to go. So we did. Out of all three people there was only one girl who I actually thought was genuine and nice. The other two were just there to get their job done. \n\nOverall, for $20 for a couple of flavorless rolls and choppy service? I guess if you're looking to not spend or eat too much... Or if you don't care about the service then you could check it out. I'd rather go somewhere else."

Not only did they have what he wanted, but they had so many other tasty items to choose from and they had AYCE for just $24.95.  Since that day, we've been here more times than we can count and it has become our favorite sushi spot.\n\nWhenever we go, we order some ahi poke, Da Kamikaze Roll (tempura, eel, spicy soft shell crab, and salmon with eel sauce), 808 Roll (spicy soft shell crab and tuna with spicy mayo and eel sauce), and Rainbow Roll.  He gets the Mango mochi for dessert and I always get their Bonzai Special (deep fried apple spring roll with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce).  Those are our favorites, but we've also tried the shrimp tempura, tako poke, hamachi kama, mochiko chicken, miso salmon kama, and a few of their other rolls.  We've yet to be disappointed.  My boyfriend's sister did try their teriyaki chicken and enjoyed it, as well. \n \nThe place is really laid back, the staff is always friendly, the service is always prompt, the seafood is always fresh, and the food is always yummy!"

            "review": "Never had a worse experience at any restaurant. The main thing that rattled my nerves was the service. I had recently moved into the neighborhood and had a late-night sushi craving, so I thought I would try this place out. When I walked in, I noticed right away that it looked like this place was being ran by a bunch of kids. Granted, the hostess/server didn't do anything wrong, they certainly weren't inviting. I sat myself at the sushi bar. \n\nAfter looking over the all you can eat menu, i told the waitress that i had decided to do that. They informed me that it was just a little passed 10pm and that last call was 10:30. I have been to a few all you can eat sushi places in Vegas around closing and understood the last call rule, but the way the said it to me made me feel like I was inconveniencing them. Let me first start by saying, the menu was very limited compared to other sushi establishments around the city! I was sitting (literally) right in front of the two sushi 'cooks.' Neither of them acknowledged me, but instead were speaking about some of the tables in the restaurant, making fun of them, and bad-talkng the hispanic cooks in the kitchen line behind them.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes of just sitting there, the server came by and took my order. I was craving a baked roll--like a lasagna. They had one similar, so i ordered that, along with a couple others. Right when one of the cooks (bigger guy that seems to have been in charge) saw my order, he told me he couldnt make that roll because he was out of scallops. I know, for a fact, they didn't run out of scallops because I saw one of the prep cooks with them. For whatever reason, they just didn't want to deal with it. \n\nAnyhow, I ordered something in place of that roll. While waiting and observing these guys go back and forth about how they cant wait to get out and huffing and puffing every time someone ordered something else, I couldn't help but to think \"why am i spending money in this place?!\" I sat there for seriously just about 10min for two rolls. When I was finished with those, I was expecting my other to come up...waited for another 10 minutes before the 'cook' realized he forgot to start making it.\n\nTo shorten up this review a bit, I am gonna leave it at that. The service was awful and the food was crap. Please people, drive a little further and spend your money at Goyemon (or even Oyshi)! At least you know they appreciate your business, you'll get good service and the food is great (speaking of Goymeon)."

The waitresses do not come around often. For example,  I was brought a roll, finished it in about 5 minutes. Then had to wait 20 mins to get my next roll.\n\nIt has been like this multiple times.

We sat at a table for 4. We ordered our food and my brothers' food who was to join us. Not too long after the food arrived my brother showed up along with our friend (unbeknownst to us). Naturally we all want to sit together, so, my husband grabs a chair from an empty table behind us for our friend. As soon as that happened the waitress rushes over to us and says that we can't do that so I told her ok than can we move to the table next to us that was a table for 6. And she tells us we can't do that either, she says in order to be sat together we would have to arrive together..WTH!!..mind you it just us and couple that was dining at the time. So, explain to me what the issue is here? My brother left along with our friend. Of course I'm confused of what just happened and wanted an explanation. To make a long story short she said it's Dean's policy (the owner) cuz there's been numerous complaints blah blah blah and that they are trying to figure out blah blah blah...really right now, save it, if you're still trying to figure $#!+ out on how to run things in the dining area than use your better judgment or your own discretion on on certain issues...like I said it was a slow day in the 808... \n\nbtw...get your knives sharpened or somethin cuz there's gotta be something wrong when you pick up one sushi and the whole roll is still connected....sushi gone wrong! \n\nYeah, such a shame to call such a place 808 when there's no ALOHA spirit or service! \n\n1 1/2 ago I raved about this place and would rate it 5stars...NOW if You ask me today I would rate this place ZERO stars but I have to rate at least 1 star to post my review.\n\nJust so you know we were here 2 weeks prior to this incident with disservice and today we decided to give it another chance...and it has gotten to this point.

The other was sloppy, like the cook seared a big chunk of tuna and then snipped it with scissors. The ends were way overcooked and 30% of the middle pieces. If I wanted plain tuna I'd just buy a can. Reason for the 3 stars is the first two times eating here it was pretty good. Just a different chef that night I guess. Hit or miss."

We use to come about once a week or so, until all our waitresses were replaced with some new ones. Our once a week trips became more like once a month. Don't get me wrong,but if you're going to name your restaurant 808-please have some sense to have people with some aloha or people that can pronounce the Hawaiian terms that's on the menu. \nNevertheless, we walk in tonight, excited to use our gift certificate that we got for Christmas, bring in some out of town family, and have the worst experience ever! What a shame 808 Sushi!!! Too our surprise, after a horrible customer service experience-waiting to get our orders about 3 times, hot tea not hot, and not even warm, waitresses clearing plates while we're in the process of eating off of them, water not refilled timely, reminding waitresses what we ordered, and then the most unbelievable experience ever.... Now we're ready to pay with our $200 gift certificate . Quickly, the waitress says, we can't do cash value and that the $200 will be forfeited. I'm appalled and state, \"We don't want cash back, we just want the remainder of our balance perhaps in another gift certificate?!\" She rushes to her manager on duty who took about 30 minutes to call the general manager 'Agnes' to tell us the same thing. Now, you have not only lost loyal customers, but this loyal customer has no problem sharing the stupidity of this restaurant. \nWhy sell someone a $200 gift certificate when you have to use it all at once or loose it?!!!! No one has time for that $h*+!!! It's $26.95 per person  for AYCE. I don't have a family of 8 to use it all at once, or specify somewhere on that big card all the rules you just made up. This isn't a group on special, my Mother-in-law paid you $200 so we can enjoy this restaurant a few times!!! FYI, sell smaller increments, or warn the buyer of this rule-(waitress heard of 2 days ago), unless your intention was to rip someone off! Who does that???!!! Or do people a favor don't sell them at all, so no one else gets ripped off. Never stepping foot in this place again and in all honesty, I would rather drive the 30 minutes to Island Sushi where they have the EXACT menu with competent people that have 'ALOHA!'"

The meat was super grisly, hard to eat, and smelled of flat top or cooking device.  \n\n\nI had deep fried roll - witch to me just had panko on top lightly crusted the bottom of the roll was not breaded. The rice was good thankfully not hard. \n\nThe dessert was the biggest disappointment - While the idea of a apple filled egg roll  like dessert intrigued my mind it fell threw on execution the ice cream was mixed into the dish and melted I MEAN COMPLETELY MELTED INTO THE DISH, Thus voiding the crispy texture of the actual dish. I was looking forward to this dish. I think since we live in dessert area I am from Phoenix too that the best way to carry ice cream is individually to avoid this process either in a smaller container and let the person place it on its own.  \n\nI really wanted to like this place I really did. However I just left a complaint with menunu and will follow threw hopefully to work out a refund. I would expect quality like this at a denny's rather the sushi joint. \n\nMeh sadly disappointing."

My husband and I come here quite often because we live really close by and sometimes my co workers and I come here to get some lunch too. \n\nThere service is mediocre when the right guys are not working. It seems that the guys do a better job than the ladies. Every time I've come and have had a lady help me I'm always waiting at least 30 to 45 minutes for a to go order even if they say give it 20 minutes or so. If I'm dining in the ladies are not as attentive. Also, when it says happy hour, I expect to get happy hour prices, but if the ladies are present they will not honor it for take out. \n\nThe foods great, but overall I try to only come here when it is happy hour since it's hard to get good service. The service brings their stars for me."

Both times everything went great. \n\nFast Service? Check! \nGood Food? Check! \nWide Selection? Check! \nFresh? Check! \n\nBoth times I started the meals with Miso Soup and Edamame. Their miso is par for the course. Also had the Agedashi Tofu which was very good. They offer a deep fried Philly roll. Which is one of my faves. The crunch on the outside, slightly melty cream cheese mixed with the salmon. Um mm Good! Spicy Scallop roll was Yum. Then had some Nigiri pieces. All were fresh, and a good size. Especially liked the Garlic Tuna. \n\nAnd then $2.50 for Hot Sake to wash it all down. I dunno how it gets any better."

The service is usually good as well, since it is a small place you have to expect that though.  There isn't really anything that jumps out at me though and that's why I have to give it 3 stars.

The appetizers are included, and the best is the Miso Black Cod. OMG, it's buttery, soft, melt in your mouth amazing. Too bad with AYCE you can only order one. I also love the poke, and the gyoza. Yummm I'm drooling just thinking about it! \n\nOnto the sushi! The best roll here is the 808 hands down. You can't get better than this. It's spicy and sweet, and everything nice. And the fish here is SOOOOO fresh! The salmon nigiri, the albacore white tuna. Mmmmm.

The bar seats were all taken but 1 and there were 2 other tables taken. We were both a little concerned that they weren't busier on a Sat. night. We took a table anyway and hoped for the best. As we rattled off our first set of orders were told they were out of Hamachi Kama ( both our fav)   Damn what a bummer.. We almost walked out but the hunger pangs in my belly told me to stay. Standouts on hot apps were the garlic chicken (very juicy) salmon collar and miso cod ( buttery and delicate) Unagi was very good but the tamago(egg custard) was terrible! The worst I ever had. The color was very off putting and I shouldn't have even tasted it. It was ice cold almost frozen! Eww.  My friend ordered a couple of fried rolls that were ok\nNothing special. The big problem was the service. Our waitress was completely unavailable to us! In 2 hours never once came to check on us. The night might've been a complete flop if not for the guy expediting the food. Super personable and funny. He even found one last hamachi and brought it to us to share. :) we ended the evening with dessert( u can only have 1 ) forgot the name but it's like a apple pie filled spring roll with vanilla ice cream whipped cream and chocolate sauce drizzle. Pretty good but the spring roll was a little greasy. As we were waiting to pay I filled out a comment card. Our waitress was the cashier and reads it right in front of us and very rudely says \" sorry my service was so bad\" !! We were both a little shocked. We left the restaurant and stood outside talking about what just happened when the manager came out and explained how she was new there and they were short a waitress tonight. He apologized and wanted to know what he could do to make us happy. He started to offer us a meal for next time but we said that is unnecessary. He was the best part of our night but there are way too many other sushi bars for me to try before I would even think about revisiting this one."

They probably have the best happy hour prices and menu that I've ever seen. All of their simple rolls, fancy rolls, fish, etc are AMAZING.  I especially love the black cod, garlic chicken (as stated before), and specially rolls. The crazy thing is that its in vegas, and you don't get good Asian (let alone sushi/Japanese food) at many places. It is moderately priced, and I think anything under 30bucks for AYCE, made-to-order sushi is great. I don't like that Todai-way of eating when the sushi has been laying out. The only reason why I wouldn't rate this place a 5 is that one time I went and they ran out of rice...HUH??! like forreals?? haha but, giving grace, it was Thanksgiving week and Black Friday was probably crazy busy...But still, who runs out of rice at a sushi place? I think the workers could of at least said something else while we waited for them to cook more...because being \"out of rice\" just made them look silly. it was almost humorous cause they ran out of 2 kinds of sodas too. The nighttime workers are a little slower and a little less approachable. BUT, I absolutely loved the daytime worker's hospitality.  I think their Hawaiian accents just make me happy too. (: A few times a couple of our groups' orders didn't come out, but it was kind of okay because our eyes were bigger than our stomach. ANYWAY, overall I LOVE THIS PLACE. I live in California, but will come to 808 Sushi every time I visit Vegas. Overall, the food is forsure a 5+ quality place! (:"

Their Happy Hour is Monday - Thursday 11:30am - 6:30pm, Friday 3 - 6:30pm and 9 - 11pm, Saturday 4 - 6pm and 9 - 11pm, and Sunday 4 - 6pm.\n\nWe ordered:\nAhi Poke ($7.95) - Hawaiian style tuna over a bed of seaweed salad. This tasted amazing!\nGarlic Chicken ($2.95) - Deep fried chicken dipped in garlic soy sauce. This was so moist on the inside and delicious!\nPork Gyoza ($2.95) - potstickers with ponzu sauce. This was okay.\nSalmon Katsu ($4.25) - panko-crusted salmon with tonkatsu sauce. This was good.\nTeriyaki Beef ($4.25) - grilled beef marinated in teriyaki sauce. This was delicious!  Gotta have this with rice!\nCrunch Roll ($5.00) - shrimp tempura, avocado, cram/crunchies, eel sauce\nHawaiian Style Roll ($6.00) - spicy tuna, cucumber/albacore, poke sauce\nKilauea Roll ($7.00) - California roll/baked dynamite mix - this was awesome!\nThe Mexican Roll ($6.00) - shrimp tempura, spicy yellowtail, jalapeno, srichacha sauce\n\nFor dessert, we got the Banzai Special (5.95) - deep fried apple spring roll with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream with chocolate drizzle.\n\nThe fish was fresh, the food tasted awesome! We ate everything so fast. With tip, we paid about $17 per person, which isn't bad. We had all the food we needed to eat, so this was a better deal than the all you can eat price.  We'll definitely be back!"

Try the Hawaiian style, Maui, 808 Special or Haleakala rolls, you can't go wrong. \n\nI saw the owners in the Sahara and Ft. Apache shopping center. They seem to be looking for a new place to lease.

On my last visit there (this was several months ago), we finished eating and we asked the cashier to split our bill which we had done dozens of times before. He told us that the owner said they aren't allowed to split bills anymore. Very inconvenient and they should probably say something about this on their menus or before we order. It seems obvious to me that when a group of four 18 year old friends come in, they're probably gonna need the bill split. \n\nAdditionally, the food is average. There are much better places to get sushi in Vegas. I've gotten sick before right after I ate here. Not sure if the two are related but I'm not going to go back and risk it."

The tuna and salmon collar is... is... sooooo good. If you've never had fish collar, you've been missing out. And unlike some other places that do AYCE, they don't try to fill you up with rice.

Now don't expect a \"irasshaimase\" when you come in because this is not a sushi spot that tries to pretend to be Japanese. Instead they're they give off a chilled islander feeling which is cool. \n\n808 Sushi are one of the few remaining sushi spots that still charge 24.95 for their dinner AYCE, sweet (I believe its 20.95 for lunch). I posted pictures of their AYCE menu and you'll notice they have a fairly decent hot menu item, some key items are the hamachi kama (yellowtail collar) and unlimited salmon collar. Most places limit you to only one salmon kama per person, but 808 lets you have all your can eat, but limit one for the yellowtail. The yellowtail kama smelled great, so I'm assuming some freshness from it, although the salmon kama did not give off such an impression.\n\nI feel that the hot menu items are a better choice than the sushi because the quality of the sushi items were nothing special. I know that its AYCE so you can't expect high quality fish and craftmenship, but.. its weird the rice and cuts of the fish are all different sizes. I noticed the chef was relatively young, maybe less than 30? So I'm sure over time the execution will improve. The rolls were decent, but didn't really have much to distinguish one from another, and most of the rolls contain eel sauce. The fish wasn't the most fresh, but didn't taste like they've been in the freezer for too long. My green tea ice cream was in the freezer for too long though because the smoothness of the ice cream was attacked by ice.\n\nThe service was nice and prompt, there was not too much wait time in between each set of order, drinks were refilled promptly, and request were done in a timely fashion. \n\nBy the way they have these cool fish paintings on the wall."

Miso soup seemed like it was missing something and I longed for tha Hanaoka miso soup.  The edamame also seemed a little flat and over cooked.\n\nBut wait, there's more.  The kalbi was tender, smoky, and delicious.  It was a good portion size and there was enough for me to be \"busog\" and take some home with me (which I'll enjoy as I write and watch football tomorrow).  It tasted like party food.  If I closed my eyes I could imagine my family there being loud and kids running around.  Comfort food is definitely the key word when I think of this place.\n\nBF had a B combo plate (13.95?) of chicken teriyaki and sashimi.  Not a fan of sashimi so I passed on that.

I walked over to see what they offered and the owner must have seen how big my eyes got at the sight of these WHITE CHANTILLY CHIFFON CUPCAKES and just handed it to me for me and my family to try. *heavennnnn* they were DELICIOUS! afterwards, my mom & aunt walked over to the case to see for themselves and the owner handed us ANOTHER pastry to try. this time, the little container it was in had a question mark. i asked what it was about and he said that the girl who bakes these pastries still hadn't come up with a name for them. from that he explained that the customers are the ones that come up with the names. there's a box on the counter for you to drop a slip into with what you think the pastry should be named. if your name wins, you win TWO AYCE dinners!! oh, i've never grabbed a pen and paper faster. the \"question mark\" pastry was another slice of heaven.. i won't share what name i gave but i think it's a winner ;]\n\nthis place if 4 STARS just because i haven't had a chance to try too many things on the menu yet (so far so GREAT!) and because the \"hot\" tea was just lukewarm and he offered us more lukewarm water to make it hotter hahah!\n\nthis place is going to be dangerous for me.. it's on the 215 (my commute to school) so i can see myself calling in take out orders every so often ;D with one visit.. i can already say i will be a regular ;D\n\n& i'm looking forward to attending HAPPY HOUR!!"

The crunch roll was just your typical cooked roll with shrimp tempura, nothing spectacular about it.\nI also shared the kake udon with my son, since he only eats noodles. This had to be one of the worst udon noodles/broth I've ever tasted. I think the udon packets you buy from a grocery store taste much better than what we had.\nMy husband had the katsu curry don, he said it was \"meh\". I guess my homemade katsu curry don is much better. The portions of this dish was pretty big. \n\nOverall, we had a wonderful service from them (I give them 4 1/2 to 5 stars for their service and attentiveness but their food is only worth 1 star). I don't think we plan on coming here again."

It's hard finding a TERRIBLE sushi place in Vegas (but they exist, I'm talking to you Nagoya on Ft Apache) but if you live in the southwest this is the one of the only places I'd go."

Might as well eat before we go...sushi craving, iPhone, yelp, filter for open now = 808 Sushi, 4 stars, sure why not?\n\nThis place was pretty easy to find, in a little strip mall in the southwest part of Las Vegas, far from the strip. Wasn't too busy and the 3 of us were able to get a table for 6, and trust me, we needed it. Sat around wondering if we should do the AYCE for $24.95, it's hard to get full on sushi for less than $50/person so the choice was easy. You can order a la carte but you'll end up spending way more (i'll get to that).\n\nOur waitress Val was the sweet, innocent type that still has her Hawaiian accent. She was very attentive as were the rest of the servers with refills as well as additional orders. Tip: the * on the menu means you can only one per person, so it stands to reason these are the more expensive items. Didn't realize that til the end and by then we missed out ordering a few things.\n\nOrdering is simple, the front page has mini portions of appetizers/entrees and the 2nd page has rolls, nigiri, and dessert\n\nHere's what we had:\n\n(#) is the number of orders\n\nI took photos of almost everything we ordered, I'll do my best to upload them\n\nAhi Poke-excellent, not much other than a little sauce/ponzu/sesame seeds\n\n(2) Agedashi Tofu-pretty standard\n\nCold Tofu-it's just tofu, good palate cleanser\n\nEdamame-standard\n\n(4) Garlic Chicken-this was good but I didn't like the sweet sauce it was cooked in and also drizzled, I ordered one with sauce on the side but it wasn't the same, Kurt F loved the sauce and drenched his chicken in it, to each his own...\n\nMiso Black Cod-this was excellent, wasn't planning on ordering it but we did during last call and I was sad when it was so good and I couldn't get more. Had a very buttery flavor but the chef said that taste was from the miso glaze and sake\n\n(2) Pork Gyoza-standard\n\nSeared Poke-not a fan, I like seared tuna but for some reason the raw poke was better\n\nRolls: I think rolls in general have too many dif flavors so I shy away from them\n\nPhiladelphia-standard\n\nPhiladelphia Deep Fried-standard\n\nSalmon Skin-mediocre/standard\n\nSpider-didn't try but heard it was good, a little heavy on the rice but it's AYCE, just order another!\n\nAlii-I was intrigued by the wasabi lime mayo but it overpowered the sushi, which might have been the point seeing as how it was deep fried white fish (mediocre\n\nHaleakala-Kurt F liked the scallops, he stabbed my hand as I was trying to take a picture\n\nHawaiian Style-this one was really good, would definitely order this again\n\nNigiri: in addition to the appetizers, this is mainly what i ate\n\n(4) Albacore-excellent\n(4) Garlic Tuna-excellent\n(2) Hamachi (Yellowtail)-wasn't fresh enough for my tastes\n(4) Hirame (Halibut)-has always been one of my faves, didn't disappoint\n\nDessert: (you can only order one per person)\n\nBanzai Special-excellent, best of all the dif choices\nScoop of Green Tea Ice Cream-Dan Y thought it was too cold. but hey, it's ice cream!\nScoop of Vanilla Ice Cream\n\nKurt F. is Jewish and i'm Chinese so on our way home we calculated how much we would have spent. The bill including tax/tip was $103, if we had ordered a la carte, $287. We win! It would have been more but Dan Y didn't hold up his end of the bargain to stuff himself. \n\nI'm fairly certain that Val was tired of running back and forth getting us all this food but she was awesome. Good experience, next time we're staying off strip I'll be going here for AYCE and this time, I'll order the Miso Black Cod first!"

Mind you, I have been a huge Sushi Mon fanatic since I discovered all you can eat sushi, so if you are going to open up an all you can eat joint, you gotta know your competition. \n\nThis place actually bodes well for competition.   I give this place 3 stars.  \n\n(1) For the price.  Good deal for all you can eat sushi for dinner.  Complete w/ sides, nigiri, and rolls.  \n(2) For the friendly service. The waiters were nice, and the first round of orders came out pretty fast.  My boyfriend and I can scarf down the first order in less than a minute though, and the second round came 15 minutes later, which is way too long to wait.\n(3) Variety.\n\nIt lacks the 4th star, because there should be a little bit more on the area of variety even though I did give it one star for this.  There are no baked rolls, or special sauces, or \"to die for\" type specialty rolls.  Everything tasted OK, but nothing came out at me to order a repeat time.  I'm from the Bay, and specialty rolls are all over the place here, and their super flavorful.   I think this place needs to add some spice to their flavorness.  It lacks the 5th star because the hamachi freshness was not as fresh as I'd want it to be.  I eat lots of raw sushi, and mercury comes a long with it, so it is VERY important to ensure you store your raw fish correctly and keep it fresh for customer's health reasons.  \n\nOh and one more thing, I would love to see a seaweed salad, or side salad available on the \"sides\" menu for the all you can eat folks.  More sides is just always great.\n\nI know this place just opened, and I will come back for a revisit! Thumbs up so far.  I will revisit my review once this place gets crackin!"

It was maybe a little bright in there, but since this is '808' Sushi, I'll tolerate the Hawaiian dose of sunshine through the large glass windows. \n\nThere's a really good energy in here, with lots of families and friends and happy people who seem to really love sushi. The servers reflect that as well - they're very friendly and highly interactive, and it's awesome when a wait staff allows their personalities to shine through. \n\nHappy Hour is fantastic! I'd really rather not gorge myself on all you can eat sushi if I can avoid it, so 808 Sushi's affordable, delicious food during Happy Hour really makes me... Happy.\n\nI preferred the rolls over the nigiri. Really good unagi-based and tempura-based modern-style rolls, they're flavorful and have great texture without being overdone. \n\nThis all makes 808 feel more like a cozy, neighborhood sushi shop to visit with familiar friends for lunch, without having to deal with the long lines, large menus, and all-you-can-eat pressure and rush of more mainstream restaurants. \n\n(For some reason we caught the happy hour from 11AM-3PM on a weekday, which doesn't seem to be listed anywhere on their website or menus, but is common knowledge among the regulars. I'm not sure about the details, since this was \"my friend's sushi place, not mine\", if you know what I mean. \n\n...but I think I'll be adding 808 to my personal rotation now, haha!)"

I got the order and a bunch of mushrooms and other weird stuff was the \"dynamite mix\" as soon as I saw the mushrooms I had her take it back. They need to specify what's in the roll.

They've got a good selection of both sushi as well as entrees/appetizers. \n\nRegarding AYCE: The AYCE option is only around $21 at lunch, which is a great deal. Their menu includes both rolls/nigiri as well as things like their mochiko chicken, poke, gyoza, etc., so even if you're not in the mood for sushi and would basically like to eat ALL THE APPETIZERS/hot items you've got yourself an excellent deal. \n\nLunch Specials: They've started offering lunch specials for awhile now, and their most expensive offering is $8.50, which includes a mound of rice w/ furikake, a full portion of mochiko or garlic chicken, 8pc spicy tuna roll, 3 nigiri (salmon, yellowtail, tuna), and salted warm edamame. The rest of the lunch bentos are cheaper and have a ton of stuff too. \n\nIn short, great portion sizes, good prices, and consistently good food. They don't put a ton of rice on their sushi as well which I appreciate. It doesn't blow my mind but I don't hesitate to come here for AYCE or take out. They are also the only place I know of that offers *reasonable* donburi like katsudon and oyakodon. (I know a place that serves katsudon in a box that barely fits 1.5 cups of food... for $8-9...)\n\nOne minor criticism from my point of view is that their spicy tuna filling is more like the texture of spicy poke. Instead of finely chopping/mincing the tuna and mixing it with the spicy sauce it is large chunks of tuna coated in the sauce. This makes the spicy tuna less spicy which makes me sad. Prepared this way it isn't much different from putting a bunch of wasabi on my tuna. Then again, I am the type of person who grew up eating spicy food and there are people on this planet that find bell peppers spicy... /shrug"

            "review": "Well... where to start... \n\nMiso black cod.. as recommended per a previous reviewer, had no flavor at all... it was very bland.\n\nThe 808 Roll was good, however it was nothing special.. the sauces they used on it didn't have any flavor. \n\nI was expecting a lot more out of this place... they limit you on a lot of things (1 per person) and those (1 per person) portions are so miniscule it makes you wish there was more then the measly ounce that you get... \n\nThe Ahi Poke was served in literally what looked like a Sake shot cup. it had a strange flavor to it and looked greyish pink, not sure how fresh it was but I only had a bite and I was done with it.\n\nThe soft shell crab they use in the spider roll was definitely cold and cooked a long time before they served it. \n\nI was hoping for more, I really was. from all the positive reviews of this place it seems that they were either having an off day or stopped caring so much about how they prepared their products. \n\nThe most disturbing part was listening to the two NSP Troopers talk about putting bullets in people's heads. not sure what was going on during that conversation however that part was duly noted loudly however I would expect someone dressed professionally in a uniform to act a certain way if they chose to take their lunch break at a sit down restaurant. I'm not removing stars for that but I'm making a notation of it because that's simply how I feel. \n\nI subtracted a star for the very small portions and limit as such,\n\nsubtracted a star for really no flavor in anything I had.\n\nSubtracted another star because I thought that they were really being lazy that day and didn't seem to care what they were putting out.\n\n1 star for the service my cup was never empty.\n1 star for how clean the restaurant looked.\n\nvery disappointing. however I may return in the future to see if things are different, if that's the case I'll write a new review, if not. then this will remain as my only saving grace to this place."

            "review": "This place has GREAT sushi but TERRIBLE customer service. I actually come here all the time. But only because I love sushi and it is very close to my home. There is one particular asian girl who works here whom is about 5'7\" always has her hair up and absolutely has the worst customer service skills I have ever experienced. I come in there ALL the time yet she NEVER makes eye contact, always sounds like she hates her life and her job and she NEVER remembers me or calls me by name or even remembers what I order. She literally acts as if she has never seen me and it's the first time, every time I go in. It bothered me so much that the last time I went in to order my \"usual\", that when she asked my name, I slightly laughed, looked her dead in her eyes and said, \"I ALWAYS come in here and you never remember my name or act like u even recognize me.\" And I shook my head annoyed as hell, paid, left zero tip and walked out. Her response? A nervous laugh and \"We get so many people\". -_-\n\nI also was annoyed when I came in to pick up an order another time and two of the employees were talking about two adults with 2 kids who were currently dining. The couple and children looked like they were not well put together or maybe were poor and the employees started discussing them (right in front of me), making jokes about them being cheap and not tiping and much more. News flash! TIPING is an EARNED effort! It is not an obligation. Quit acting like entitled employees and earn your tips! (This is coming from someone in the tip industry). Not only that but how rude of them to talk about patrons in front of other customers. I seriously worry that they would do something to your food if you don't tip based on their immature and under developed work ethic. Great food. Very bad service. EDIT: These employees have either been fired or quit because I no longer see them. Also, their customer service has improved so I changed my rating from a 2 star to a 4."

            "review": "Decided to try this place based on another website & the fact that it was close to my work & I would definitely go back here again. We arrived around 12pm. There was only 1-2 other tables in the place but I think the fact that it's so new (open for 1 month) that no one yet knows about them. They do have an AYCE menu but since we were on a time constraint we opted to just get a couple of items of the menu. I do want to try their AYCE. Unfortunately they don't do 1/2 orders of AYCE like some places but I guess I will just have to take a few hungry friends so we can try many things & really get a feel for the menu. \n\nMy guest ordered the Haleakala Roll which is a California Roll, Spicy Scallop, baked with eel sauce. He stated that it was very good. \n\nI ordered Unagi (which I was leery to do since I've had bad  experiences in the past at other locations but opted to go for it.) It was quite delicious. Cooled very well. Soft & not hard & rubbery. I also ordered the Spider Roll which is one of my favorite rolls. I figure that if a sushi place can make a good spider roll that I like then they are worth going to. Um - bad mistake. It was over cooked so it tasted burnt & flavored the whole roll wrong. I informed them of this right away (we were seated @ the bar) & they immediately made me a new one which was much better. I told them how the bad one tasted & they said that they purposely over cook it since people want their food over done. I don't think that's the real case - I think someone just got carried away @ the fryer. But due to the fact that they took immediate care of it & were concerned about our satisfaction - I would definitely go back again. I also ordered a Rainbow Roll as my dining mate wasn't that fond (or familiar) of nigiri based on a previous experience. I think we've all had that bad experience that causes us not to want to try something again. So I opted for the Rainbow Roll since it wasn't straight up Nigiri. He decided after the 5th & final piece that \"bait\" wasn't all that bad. I think (hope) that he will try it in the future.  \n\nAmbiance was nice for a lunch crowd. A little chilly but I was sitting directly under the AC vent. The owner Dean (and rest of staff) was super nice, chatty & helpful. Dean even gave me a 20% off card for my next meal there. I inquired about lunch & happy hour specials & he said that they would be implemented soon. They will have happy hour every day of the week with 50% off some of their rolls, $1 sake, beer specials, etc. I will defiantly be going back for lunch (even with my so-so spider roll experience) as well as well as maybe even stopping off for a happy hour sometime & they didn't even have to throw in the complimentary Banzai Special.  \n\nMenu: \nhttp://808sushimenu.info/Menu_Page_1.html \nhttp://808sushimenu.info/Menu_Page_2.html"

If this was my first time here, it would be my last.  \n\nFirst, they were out of hamachi kama, which was forgivable, but still disappointing.  For the first half of this visit, the sushi chef seemed to ignore us.  After that he was more attentive.  Unfortunately, his skills, if you call them that, were not up to par.  The rolls were cut inconsistently with some pieces so small they would fall apart.  Other pieces were so large, they could not be eaten in one bite.  I ordered one baked roll.  He forgot it in the oven.  Mistakes happen, just don't serve your mistakes to me.  It was burnt to the point of being not edible.  Even the server commented on it being burnt.  One of the guys was pushing oyster shooters because they made too many.  Fine, I decided to have a couple.  Not too bad, except for the piece of styrofoam I got with it.  \n\nThis visit wasn't a total flop.  The miso black cod is great.  The bonsai special is always a good was to end the meal.  \n\nI will return only because everyone is entitled to a bad day and I have had good meals here in the past."

That's really been my only negative experience.  Like I said though the other handful of times we've had no problems.  Oh and they got the best desert of an AYCE sushi place too lol.

The service was excellent both times and the quality of food was spot on. This is my new go to spot for AYCE. \n\nThe menu for AYCE is huge. A lot more choices than most AYCE Sushi restaurants. It was $26.95 per person. I didn't get any pictures because we ate the food so fast. They have a couple items that you can only order once (Miso Black Cod). But it doesn't matter because the menu is huge. Oh and that Miso Cod is so good, literally melts in the mouth.\n\nWe are totally those people that pig out on AYCE sushi. Here is what we ordered:\n\nPhiladelphia Roll (2), Candy Cane. 007, Hawaiian Style, Triple Crown, Rainbow Roll, Miso Cod (2), Nigiri-- Albacore (2), Hamachi (2), Tuna (2), Amaebi (2). I know pigs!!\n\nThey also have really good prices on alcohol. We ordered to Kirin Lights for $4.00 each. Most places are $7.00.\n\nThey have Happy Hour everyday (I think) and pretty much everything is half off including Sake. This is a great deal if you are not going to totally pork out like us. The restaurant is actually a good size and they get the food out fast.  If you are looking for a great AYCE I would def. give this place a try."

Service was mostly good but we had a wait before they took our order (kind of strange too since another waitress wasn't busy, refilling things which should be done on their down time).\n\nWe were able to order a couple of items on the happy hour specials and they made a \"last call\" for orders.  We ordered some combinations and there was a *lot* of food, that we had plenty to take back (luckily we had a full kitchen at our resort so that worked out).  There was another patron there that was also visiting from Hawaii and he blew up balloon art for the kids.\n\nThe Hawaiian twist on the food was very good and made for some delicious combinations.

The rolls are made a little smaller (thinner) than most sushi places, which is fine by me.  In an AYCE setting, that just means being able to enjoy more variety.  My group had the six different rolls.  We felt the Lahaina, Hawaiian Style, and Pele were all very good.  The appetizer selection is not quite as extensive as some other AYCE places, but they were all quite good.  I appreciated the three raw fish choices they had -- Ahi Poke, Seared Ahi Poke, and Seared Salmon Sashimi.  They were all prepared well.  Most places have more fried appetizers than anything, so this was a pleasant surprise.  A positive note is that the Ahi Poke is simply a bowl of fresh fish and is not layered with \"filler\" items, such as seaweed, cucumber, onions, etc.  Our server was efficient and friendly, although her knowledge of the menu items could definitely use some help.  Overall, I enjoyed the meal and would come back.  Oyshi Sushi, about a mile away, has a larger menu and the sushi and rolls are slightly better.  The only problem is that you will have to wait a while during peak hours and the last couple of times I went, the service was REALLY slow."

I ordered all you can eat, I started with Ahi Poke which was ice cold, Tempura Veggies and Shrimp (How could that get messed up), Da Kamikazi roll (Good flavor), 808 Special (great Taste), Haleakala (It was ok), and a half Kilauea which I was told that would have to be my last. When I asked why they could not answer me, the place was picking up I had been there for about 35 minutes so I looked on the menu to see if there was a time limit nothing on the menu. the staff had a ok attitude. But overall It cost me $29.14 for a small bowl of frozen Ahi, 2 tempura shrimp, 5 pieces of tempura veggies, and 3 1/2 rolls which I could have had off their happy hour menu for about $23. There are quite a few sushi places in Vegas my recommendation is go somewhere else, if you have a time policy or any other policy have it up in writing so customers know what they are"

I am a respectful eater and I expect the same treatment as a customer. Don't hawk at me, I understand the rules and I will not share. Or perhaps they were staring because they could not believe the amount of food that I could eat all on my own?  Regardless, please don't stare and just serve my food.\n\nIt's better than bad.  The service was slow. I enjoyed that they have hamachi kama on the AYCE appetizers, which I love. The poke tuna was ok, it lacked flavor. Shrimp tempura was a little soggy and warm.  I did like the agadeshi tofu.  I liked the tako karaoge (deep fried octopus).\n\nNigiri sushi.....It was hard to decipher if the fish was fresh. They kept on putting sauce over the nigiri when I asked them not to. In order to taste the fish if it's fresh or rancid, eating in its rawest form is the best way to determine. I ordered the following twice...Yellowtail, white tuna, snapper, which all had sauce added to it. Masago and Ikura was a little salty but I kind of like it. The amaebi sweet shrimp was really good, but the deep fried shrimp head was hard and chewy. They never served my hokkigai (surf clam) and said they ran out of the Uni after waiting for 30 minutes....\n\nThe salmon skin hand roll was really good.  I wanted to order some special rolls because it looked really great from others. However, they don't let you order half orders rolls unless it is your last order.  These rules are weird to me and especially when they forget some of my items. \n\nOne great thing about 808 Sushi is that it is right around the corner of my house and the convenience is fantastic. \n\nWould I come back here again? Yes, because I really want to push them to DO NOT add sauce to my Nigiri unless requested. I must review by the quality of the fish and next time...I want to try the special rolls and dine with other AYCE eaters!"

If you never tried this real authentic version of spicy tuna (the fake looks bright red from schiracha sauce) then you won't know WHAT you should be craving!\n-Hamachi collar. Ask any chef, she/he knows the best part of a fish is the collar (except for toro). The fatty flavorful meat seared crispy on the outside but soft and wonderful on the inside, just like me!\n-Miso Cod, soft buttery with mild miso sauce. I like this much better than the traditional miso butterfish which has more shoyu in it. This version is much more delicate.\n-Salmon collar, which has an intense amount of fat in the meat. Was pure inddulgence.\n-The nigiri - uni, unagi, hamachi, and halibut were all of quality standards.\n\nDuring the ending though I felt I was overloaded with msg, I think due to the natural fattiness and saltiness of the Hamachi collar, Miso, and salmon collar. Bad move eating all three in one sitting but had to try since it was my first time here. Next time I'll limit myself from indulging in all three.\n\nIf they had baked clams with the crusty mayo sauce on top, it would be perfection!\n\nWent on a Wednesday, 2 large groups came in, luckily, when we were nearing the end of our dining experience. This place gets crowded, and for a good reason!"

I usually order their combination dinner (teriyaki salmon and shrimp tempura) because you get a good amount and it keeps me full. Their teriyaki salmon is my favorite thing on their menu.

I've never tasted garlic chicken like that before. I would come to 808 sushi all the time and order just the Garlic Chicken and be satisfied. That goooood. The Ahi Poke and Cucumber salad was delightful. So glad it did not taste fishy. Yuck. I like how they add seaweed salad with the Ahi Poke on the bottom, not a bad pair. Now with the sushi, I've only tried the Kilauea roll, Hawaiian style roll, and salmon skin roll. It wasn't bad. Quality of the sushi and presentation was mediocre.

While he may have one of the best eel sauce, he is still an apprentice. Offering a very limited selection of apps and rolls that fail to impress me. \n\nTheir house roll, 808 special was just okay. If they're own house special roll fails to impress me I don't think the other rolls will impress me. I also took half a dragon roll since it was my last order, no complaints here, but nothing special either. Maybe I'm just being a sushi elitist.\n\nI was given the shrimp heads from my sweet shrimp that was lightly fried. It could have been much better if it was fried more throughly through so I can actually eat the entire head in 1 bite, instead of just sucking the inside. Places like Lotus of Siam and even Brian's Beach Sushi get this, but not Ichiza or this 808 Sushi. \n\nThe ahi poke, I just couldn't bare myself to finish it. Just something about the flavors made me not want to finish it and I hate wasting seafood.\n\nThe hamachi kama, yellowtail collar, was grilled to a crisp. It just wasn't grilled right because all I could taste is burnt flavor. To be fair, grilling seafood properly is really difficult to get it just right, sadly they fail to do this properly. Hikari got this right.\n\nThe seared salmon sashimi was good, but I found it unnecessary to add the hot peppers on it. Salmon already is very flavorful on its own, no need to add additional spices that mask its natural flavor. \n\nThe gyoza came out hot, crispy, and tasty, but request it as pan fried instead. This will help preserve more of the flavor that get lost when you fry food.\n\nThe uni had the good creamy texture, but the dark yellow color tells you the grade of uni isn't that great. But hey, it tastes great and thats all that matter.\n\nThe banzai desert is apple pie filling wrapped up in a dough to form what resembles an egg roll. Its deep fried and then cut in half, served with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream. Good, but a small problem with this. Combining something that is relatively hot like the apple pie filling and taking a bite of an ice cream is not a good combination. This may hurt your teeth a little because of the coldness of the ice cream and the hard and hotness of the apple roll. Its similar to filling a plastic bottle with hot water, pouring it out, then immediately pouring cold water over it. Try it for yourself and see what happens. This  temperature differential is not good for you. Letting the apple roll cool down will fix this problem.\n\nThe fisherman also has a Hawiian dad that takes over part of the menu. The dad's influence is great for those who don't like sushi, but those wanting more of the Japanese influence will be disappointed because there is no dynamite, screaming orgasm, soft shell crab, oysters, or toro on the all you can eat menu.\n\nThe sushi bar has an open kitchen, but there are also someissues with this. First, if you sit right next to the grill, you'll get some of the smoke from it. You also see the owner ordering his staff to make sure the order gets out. While I really admire his push to get out food, it just kind of kills the good vibe of eating at a sushi bar. I just got a bad vibe from the owner at the end of my meal, despite having a very good vibe of him at the beginning of the meal. How quickly things change. Otherwise, the front of the house are really attentive and really friendly.\n\n808 Sushi is another sushi restaurant, but I'm not really seeing the hype about this place. With some small improvements and additions, I can see this place being really special. Otherwise, its just the place you go for all you can eat sushi with a limited selection, and happen to have friends who don't like sushi. Spend a couple of more bucks and stick with Hikari or Sushimon for your all you can eat sushi needs."

We have driven by this place numerous times over the past 2 years and not once set foot in here so we decided to go there for our date night. It has a very positive upbeat ambience. A bit small. Definitely have that family feel to it. The manager on duty was extremely attentive and checked in with all guests to ensure beverages were being refilled, etc. Best sushi we had that night was Candy Cane. It was delicious. Prices here are average for AYCE. Checkout is a bit inconvenient as it is directly in front of the entrance and hard to tell if people are coming or going. Again small location. They have multiple TV screens up for sports and such. Overall good."

Once we were told we could not be seated until the whole party had arrived, meanwhile the restaurant had one other table. I could understand that if it was busy and we would be holding up a table for a big party. We were only a party of 4. \n\nThey also made an issue when we had asked for separate checks. Our server said it was fine but when we received the check it was not separated and they had added taxes as well as 18% gratuity with NO breakdown. When we had asked to at least explain to us the taxes and tip the server then passed us off to another server who was extremely rude despite us being polite about the matter. She then passed us off to the manager and made it very evident she was upset. \n\nThe manager explained again it was their new policy but could do us a favor since they were not busy. We then asked if they expect each party over 5 to have one person take care of the check? Should we have to split our parties to different tables just so we could each pay our own check? It is one thing to not split our check however to make an issue of the way we are paying is just ridiculous. \n\nLastly, as we left no one even said good bye as they normally do. \n\nOur family frequented this place at least once a week and I can say we will NEVER go here again."

For its price, the quality was amazing and it tasted much better than other high-end sushi restaurants. I would've like to have tried more, but my stomach couldn't handle everything.

They have a large kitchen, sushi, and roll menu.\n\nRecommendations: \nKitchen menu -  Ahi poke, Garlic Chicken (juicy), Mochiko chicken, pork gyoza, teriyaki chicken\n\nRoll menu - 808 special, triple crown, baked scallop, haleakala, kilaeuea, unagi.\n\nDessert: (comes w/ the all-u-can eat menu)\nBanzai Special (AMAZING)\n\nI don't ever order teriyaki chicken because it's on a typical teriyaki sauce, but this place has its own unique recipe and it doesn't taste like any teriyaki chicken I've had. It was delicious.\n\nA+++ on all categories"

The last Sushi place we have been going to, we were always the only ones in there and it always concerned me (both as to why? and how fresh could the fish be if there was no turnover) - so seeing full tables bodes well to me.  We had to wait 10 minutes for a table since it is so small in there, but I was ok with it.\nWe are AYCE fans, but their AYCE menu is sort of limited IMO...but we still found lots of things we enjoyed!\nWe started with the Garlic Chicken per the Yelp recommendation and it was super good!  We only got 4 small pieces, and I saw another table get a much larger portion which made me sad as I could have eaten more.\nWe tried lots of different rolls and didn't get over stuffed super fast like at other places. The fish tasted fresh, but we get the Special rolls that aren't really fish fish.\nThe spicy tuna, spicy crab and spicy mayo - none were all that spicy.  I could have used some more heat. However, I still loved the taste and there was no burning in my mouth!\nMy only complaint is how they run the waiting on tables.  We had 3 different people take our orders, and they wouldn't always know if someone else had recently taken a order. They would see us not eating and someone would stop to check on us and want us to order another roll - while I totally appreciated the attentiveness, it made for some confusion about what rolls we were on and what we were waiting for. \n\nThey offer a punch card - 10 AYCEs get 1 free.\n\nAlso, very kid friendly apparently.  There were TONS of kids in there."

Full price I would stay away from it though.\n\nWe got lots of different appetizers from cucumber salad to a Salmon Katsu.\n\nThen come the rolls.

This is a review of a non-sushi item, so while my personal experience was 2-stars, I am giving a one star bump for the possibility that they offer a better sushi experience.\n2.

Previous to this discovery I had been thinking \"boom like an 808.\"\n\nNow, for the review:\n\nWhile I do occasionally go for AYCE sushi, I am not a sushi fanatic. I wasn't raised on seafood, so I have to be in a special mood to order AYCE sushi. When I went to 808, I was not in that mood, so I ordered chicken yakisoba and a house salad instead. \n\nThe server forgot my house salad, so no information there. However, I was not a fan of the noodles. There were slim pickins when it came to vegetables, and the chicken was not my favorite. It had a flavor that I refer to as \"chickeny chicken,\" which I understand really makes no sense, but it is an artificial, perhaps frozen, chicken taste. I ended up piling all of my chicken in a corner of the plate and simply eating the noodles. \n\nI guess the lesson learned is skip the noodles at a place known for AYCE sushi."

The sushi is more Americanized and the quality and taste is a little above other Hawaiian-sushi joints"

I had the mochiko chicken plate and kalbi plate to go and it was pretty puny for a plate lunch, maybe a sampler.  the mochiko chicken was all dry and tasted too much like uncooked flour.  the kalbi pieces were cut too thin and all burnt. the salad that came with the food was small and tasted ok. they do have a pretty good menu selection which is a plus so i'll probably give them another shot. they also have the kauai special sushi combination so i have to try it."

Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard ...\"\n\nNo seriously, this hawaiian sushi joint is okay.  The half-price happy hour makes it worthwhile.  However, they really need to take it easy on the sweet-teryiaki sauce on their rolls.  The specialty rolls were drenched in this sauce.  Way too sweet.  If you go, ask them to not add any of this sauce on your rolls.  \n\nMoreover, this restaurant is on the AA dining awards program.  Six miles for each dollar spent.  $30 tab means 180 miles.  Shazaam."

So my good girlfriend and I love to try out different places for happy hour and we are some sushi lovers! So.. what do we do hop on yelp and look at some local places not far from where we live to go eat! 808 sushi pops up and we set our taste buds on it. The pictures didn't do justice! Everything we ordered was extremely tasty! I love the fact that they have the happy hour as a to-go option! AND the happy hour doesn't require for you to sit at the bar tops like most places which is another plus. Customer service was above par because EVERYONE speaks to you when you first walk in and when you leave. Sitting at the bar top watching the sushi chef prepare our food was actually pretty cool. He was very friendly and kept a good conversation going! We tried so much and I'd have to vote the 808 Rolla and the Tempura roll as my favorite! I will return for sure, especially because it's not even a mile from my house."

It's not the best sushi place in Vegas but happy hour is pretty decent. \n\nNote to bigger parties --they don't let you split the check which kind of sucks. So make sure to bring cash. I didn't know that beforehand but luckily, I had some on me."

I was pretty disappointed with the Tako.  I understand that octopus is a bit rubbery... but I just had to try it. Maybe they had found a way to  fry it with our overcooking it....nope.\n\nGarlic Chicken was super yummy.  My new favorite.  We love karaage.  The sauce that they dip this one is is delish.  Even our picky daughter ate it....and LIKED it!\n\n\nMy bf ordered a 2-item combo (Kal-bi and Chicken Katsu) that came with rice, miso soup and a salad....And dessert! mochi ice cream.... yum.\n\nI ordered a small Chirashi...and I tried to order my daughter a side of Chicken Katsu but the nice server lady said, \"thats a LOT of food...the portions are pretty big\".  I took her word for it.... even though we're pretty big eaters ;) haha\n\nShe wasn't kidding.  We ended up with a ton of food... we finished it all.... but there was a lot of it. And it was all delicious. \n\nDownside: they close at 10. Which sucks. because It's 9:56 and now I'm in the mood for the monster Chirashi...."

Everyone is very helpful and kind.  The rolls like I said taste great.  Non happy hour the rolls are larger and still packed with great flavor.  Not the best sushi place around but tasty!"
