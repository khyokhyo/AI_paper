That is alot of $$$ but we just went with the flow...and it ended up ok."

            "review": "I came here for the first time this weekend and some girlfriends and I enjoyed an amazing meal at FIX. We sat in the lounge area, which is a great spot to people-watch. The caesar salad is a great opener, with a wonderful dressing and the perfect amount of shaved parmesan.\n\nOur pre fixe meal, which mostly consisted of appetizers and small bites, then progressed to lobster tacos, which I enjoyed even though I have a pretty strong seafood aversion. These are cold and about the size of two bites, but they are made with mango, avocado, and cilantro. Excellent. We had Bill's Spicy Tuna, which are cubes made with crispy rice and finished with a garlic ponzu sauce.\nWe were given Buffalo style wings as well, but I didn't have as much of those because I was too busy filling up on the Kobe sliders, which were prepared at a perfect medium-rare and served with aged cheddar and grilled onions. And the fries. Oh, the fries. What IS that seasoning? -- Maybe garlic and sea salt? Whatever it is, it's delicious and highly addicting.\nOur dessert was a banana-filled doughnut, which I didn't try but heard raves from the others in our group that did.\n\nOur service was nothing short of outstanding. Sabrina took amazing care of us and made sure that no glass was empty, and that everyone was enjoying their meal. Attractive female servers are a dime a dozen in Vegas, but Sabrina was friendly and totally personable to boot!"

            "review": "We tried out this trendy spot before we went to a show at the Bellagio Hotel is Vegas. The atmosphere was great and the low lighting set a romantic/relaxing vibe. We were seated right at the time our reservation was set for and handed our menus. We had three different servers approach our table at different times to take our drink orders, which let us confused as to who our server was. The drink order took about  15-20min to come out, which seemed quite extreme seeing that there were many tables still open for seating. The cucumber martinis we ordered were equal to two martinis. They were DELISH! We ordered another round along with our food order to ensure that we get to enjoy them before the start of our show. We ordered a couple side salads and split the Truffle Penne Pasta dish, which was more than enough for two people. Once we had all finished our dinner and drinks we had to wave down our waitress for a third round of drinks and our check. It literally took her 20 + minutes to brink our drinks and another 15 minutes to bring our check. We once again had to waive her down to run our credit card and that took another 10 minutes for her to complete. Thank Goodness we gave ourselves almost 2 hours to eat otherwise we would've missed our show! Overall, the atmosphere, food, and drinks were great but the service was horrific, which is why I could not give this place a better rating. I would highly suggest you come here for a drink or two and skip out on the formal sit down dinner."

            "review": "We wanted to eat here the first night we flew into Vegas but the wait for a table around 10PM was like 30-45 minutes so we said forget it.\n\nAs we were killing some time in the Bellagio on a separate day, I saw an advertisement here for a prix-fixe meal for $40 from 5-7PM. Now, that's still pretty expensive, but if you just look at the entrees on the menu at Fix, just alone the entree will cost you at least $40! The only caveat was that you'd have to have an early dinner, which was fine for the 3 of us, so we made a reservation for 7PM and I made sure to ask the hostess that even if we arrived at 7PM, would we still be able to order the prix-fixe menu and she said \"of course.\"\n\nSo we arrive exactly at 7PM, were shown our table which looked out to the Casino floor (score! since I love people-watching). I told our server we were going to dine from the prix-fixe menu and she said it wasn't available. I told her that the hostess earlier said we'd be able to so she checked with someone and told us that out of the 3 entrees only 2 would be available, which was fine with us; so we ordered!\n\nHere's the lo-down:\n-caesar salad or tomato soup\n-daily pasta or roasted chicken (surf & turf not available)\n-doughnuts or brownie\n\nI got the tomato soup which was sooo good and I loved how they cut the crust off my grilled cheese! The daily pasta was good too, but the smell of the truffle-parmesan actually made me a bit queasy. The best part of the meal of the dessert. I recommend the brownie which came with a cold espresso drink. The brownie was warm, chocolaty and rich in flavor. Portions weren't tiny at all and I'd definitely come back just for the set menu! Service was attentive, hospitable and warm."

            "review": "Full Disclosure:  I have an axe to grind with this kind of food...\n\nFor the short attention span set:\n-trendy food (not a compliment)\n-mediocre burgers inside fantastic buns\n-upscale, modern atmosphere\n-cute, if precious presentations\n\nThat being said, put in proper context (i.e. this is the Bellagio), their food is reasonably tasty.  It's meant as an upscale bar restaurant, and it gets the job done, albeit with the typical lack of soul that is par for the course on the strip.  I stuck strictly with appetizers, as was recommended by a friend who really enjoys this place up and down.   The highlight of the menu were the Kobe beef sliders...but not for the beef.  As we had a large party, I had a chance to sample sliders from different orders, and the range of doneness was completely inconsistent.  Some were nicely med-rare while, unfortunately, many others were well done with the core of the burger a dead grey.  This was almost made up for by absolutely frickin wonderful burger buns.  Great texture, good sponge, and a hint of sweetness in a white crumb.  A nice touch is that the buns are brushed with an egg wash which gives a boost to the texture.  Unlike the burger itself, every bite of bun that I had was a good one.\n\nNext up was a frito misto which included both rock shrimp and squid. Nothing too shabby, but the seasoning definitely overpowered the contents.  However, if you're into the batter, then I guess it really won't matter what's inside.  Actually now that I think about it, it was definitely more like Cantonese style \"salt and pepper\" coating more than an Italian Frito Misto...\n\nThen came the \"very adult mac & cheese\"  basically it was mac & cheese with surprise!  (not really) truffle oil.  The mac & cheese is then cut into sticks, breaded up and deep fried.  To be straight up, a good number of folks at our table really enjoyed this, but I found that it overused the truffle oil.  Again, if you're of the \"never have enough foie or truffles\" mindset, then you'll actually like it.  Truffles are a potent ingredient, and in my opinion, it's a difficult thing to balance properly.  Most places want  to impress you by hitting you over the head with it, and FIX is not alone.\n\nA nice flourish was something they call \"forks\", but basically it's smoked salmon with a little creme fraiche on top of a speared mini-blini and topped with osetra caviar.   Pretty normal brunch fare, but presented cutely.\n\nOn the other hand the \"Kobe chili cheese fries\" was completely forgettable, although the regular fries were nicely done.\n\nThe decor scores on the \"make you feel cool\" vibe with the wavy wooden plank roof, and it's appropriate for the location.\n\nIn the end the style of food is pretty unimaginative, it's typical snazzed up \"comfort food\" that probably hits the target market, but doesn't satisfy folks who have respect for real comfort food.  Also, it's a prime example of gourmet pandering...\n\n1. take a simple food\n2. add pricey ingredients\n3. ?\n4. PROFIT!\n\nExcept in this case, we all know \"?\" actually means \"charge up the ass.\"  Even if you can't relate to my take on things, have you ever thought...\"oh man, Kobe beef's so overrated, I don't know what the big deal's about\" ...well that's because of places like this.  Basically, restaurants know that if they put Kobe or Foie on their menus, they can instantly charge a premium and sell hundreds of the dishes a night. (I could also rant on things labeled Sea Bass and the use of short ribs....but I'll save that for another time).  \n\nProperly prepared Wagyu and specifically Kobe can be a truly heavenly experience...but when you take what is essentially beef's version of foie, but then grind it up for burger patties or chili, the ingredient is slaughtered.  You can duplicate the result at home just by grinding up corn-fed chuck and adding extra strips of beef fat to the mix....  In any case, actual Kobe, and Kobe-style meat should be almost scary white and as raw as you can stand.  So next time you see Kobe ground up for something, braised, or cooked like a regular steak, skip it, your wallet will thank you and your tongue won't miss a thing.  If you want Kobe, but  cringe at the thought of beef sashimi,  just head out to Nobu at the Hard rock.  Their new style Kobe Beef is both different from the traditional shabu shabu, but still respects the ingredient.  It's been around for years, but they still manage to do it well.\n\nSure, I hate this kind of food, but at least they make up for it with some winners, and it's perfectly appropriate for what it is."

            "review": "My cousin came up on bacarrat, and decided to treat us all out.  So walked to around Bellagio, and settled on this place -- can't go wrong with steak and lobster.  It was Aug 1, a Sunday night.\n\nThe place is pretty dark.  Woulda been nice to have an intimate dinner for 2-4.  We had 12 or so?  They seated us at 2 adjacent round tables.  Our table was having lots of fun and laughing, so the other table asked if we could have em pushed together, and they actually did it... kinda weird to have 2 round tables pushed together, but whatever.\n\nThey played a lot of top 40s hits, which I felt kinda threw off the ambience.  Jazz or R&B mighta been better.\n\nAnyway, I went with the seabass, as did a cousin of mine.  It came with risotto, which we both noticed was undercooked.  The seabass itself was ok, but not worth $30.\n\nAnother cousin got the filet mignon, which he loved.  He also raved about the sauce it came with...\n\nWe also got the aspargus with truffle fondue sauce, which was... interesting.  It was a delicate texture that packed a punch, but I can't say I would get it again.\n\nThe lobster mash looked and sounded amazing, but disappointingly fell short.\n\nOne of my cousin's daughter got a steak + Maine lobster.  She thought it was good, but nothing great.\n\nThe other table got \"the ultimate Shell fix,\" which was this big appetizer plate with lobster, prawns, crab, clams, and oysters.  When they bring it out, everyone's eyes lit up and we oo'd... it definitely help whet our appetite.  I think it came out on a 4-layer plate rack... brownie points for presentation.\n\nThe bill came to over $600, and it was nice of my cousin to pay for all of us.  Personally, I separate my dining experiences into the following 3 categories:\n\n1) dining out = $20-30\n2) splurge = $40-60\n3) big splurge = $100+\n\nAnd the line between splurge and \"big\" splurge is thin.  I think for the amount of money dropped per person at Fix, we could've enjoyed our food much more.  To be fair, probably 75% of us were really happy with the food.  I was still held up on the hard risotto, and the \"meh\" seabass.  Next time I'm back in Vegas to splurge on a meal, I would definitely want to check out a new place."

A liquid-less martini glass with a puff of cotton candy arrives to your table and then the waitress shakes her shaker, pours the concoction over the cotton candy, and it dissolves and disappears. Don't be sad though, because this drink does not disappoint! I ordered the gumdrop martini which arrived with a skewer of 4 large gumdrops across the top. Mmmm! It was almost too cute to drink!"

            "review": "Even though I'm giving Fix a one star rating, the food was rather good. To be fair I'll give a full review and then switch gears at the end...\n\nI was in Las Vegas last month with my company for Magic (the huge fashion convention) and on our first night in town we decided to go out and have a fancy company dinner. After several calls to multiple restaurants we finally decided on Fix in the Bellagio.\n\nWe showed up Sunday evening around 9pm and the place was completely packed. Luckily we thought ahead and made a reservation. In just a few minutes our table for six was ready.\n\nTo get the night going we ordered a couple bottles of wine. We took our time looking over the menu and even longer making our final decisions. Everything on the menu seemed delicious! I landed on the lobster tacos (with grilled mango, and cilantro) to start. The four small tacos came on a serving plate that perfectly fit each taco. The shells were crispy and the lobster was fresh and juicy. The small cilantro leaves were a great way to make the lobster flavor pop even more.\n\nFor my entree I got the seabass (with risotto, baby shrimp, and lobster broth). The cut of fish was cooked perfectly and when I cut into it the lobster broth soaked in and made the bass even more delicious. The baby shrimps were nice additions as well and were cooked just right.\n\nThe night was going great up to this point. The food was delicious and the service was top notch. It was a great night to celebrate our first night in Sin City. That is until my boss found a safety pin in her risotto (see photo I included). Yes, a safety pin! You know, those incredibly sharp objects that can stick in your throat if ingested. Yep, those things. Thankfully she saw it before she unknowingly ate it. Of course, we immediately called for the manager as our server took the dish away.\n\nThe manager told us that this \"doesn't happen that often\". Hmm, so it has happened before? How could a safety pin even land in someone's food? If I find a hair in my meal the review instantly drops down to 3/5 stars and I expect the meal to be free. But a SAFETY PIN is completely inexcusable. The real kicker was that my boss didn't receive a new entree and when we got the bill her dish wasn't even comped. Instantly we called for the manager again and made sure her meal was free. Honestly we were completely shocked that the entire meal wasn't comped when a mistake that dangerous has happened.\n\nWhen dining out at high-end restaurants it's expected that your experience will be flawless, especially when you're paying these extreme prices. When something as outrageous as a safety pin finds its way in a customer's dinner, I, as well as the rest of my co-workers, would expect the restaurant to do anything and everything it can to remedy the mistake. Unfortunately the restaurant failed on every level and fully deserve such a low rating. So please, be sure to inspect every bite while dining here!"

At first I was having doubts whether we picked a good place as nothing on the menu was jumping out at me.\n\nI decided to go outside my comfort zone and order Duck & Waffles (Confit, Fried Egg, Maple Bourbon Syrup). I was blown away. What a weird combination of flavors that worked amazing together. The duck was cooked perfectly and paired so well with the waffles, syrup and eggs, I couldn't believe it. My only gripe is that 2 fried eggs should be served, as one egg isn't enough for the number of waffles and size of the duck portion. \n\nOur food came out quickly, but our waitress wasn't paying attention and wasn't sociable.  \n\nSo happy we chose FIX and the Duck and Waffles!"

I had the sliders and they were honestly the best sliders I have ever had. Cooked to perfection, and very filling. I was initially concerned about spending $29 on sliders, but after receiving my plate of 3 along with fries, I was full and couldn't eat anymore. Only negative I have and why it's not a full 4 or 5 star is because we had reservations and still had to wait about 15-20 minutes before getting seated, and then once seated it took about 45- 1 hour to receive our food. People of about the same group sat about 15 minutes after our table and got served before us by about 10 minutes. This cause us to be late for our bottle service over at Marquee which didn't start our night off right. \n\nLet's hope that was a one off experience on service and not an every time occasion."

I am seriously having orgasms in my mouth just thinking about how good the food was! \n\nFound this place when I decided to skip the usual buffet and eat somewhere different and non-chainy (not a big fan of chain restaurants, but anyway....). Came across FIX.. on Yelp. \n\nAte mini lobster tacos and at $23 for 4 mini (and I mean, mini), you would think one would be put off, but the taste is amazing! Served with avacado puree and the tastiest lobster that might ever touch your tongue. Also had the very adult mac and cheese. \nO M G! I mean, you can hardly go wrong with mac n cheese, but the mac n cheese sticks were lightly battered and fried, filled with the creamiest blend of unique cheeses, and some garlic aoli or something. Doesn't really matter, because it was deee lissssh ussss! \nLastly the scallops on potato pancakes doesn't sound fabulous, but the scallops were melt in your mouth and cooked to perfection. With the bacon and crab hollandaise sauce, yummmmm, my mouth is orgasming again. \n\nFor the prices you might expect a restaurant that looks higher end, and also being that it's located in the Bellagio, you might expect snooze and snob, but the place is very lounge- like, people enjoying the bar, the electronica music and the good looking (well- mostly) people. \n\nThe 3 waiters (yes, 3 waiters) - Brock, Tom and Costa- were very attentive, nice and provided excellent service. Were they working undercover? I don't know, but they did a great job waiter-ing.\n\nNext time in town, I am for sure going to get my Fix!"

We had the lobster tacos, calamari, rock shrimp and some tuna for appetizers. I had a excellent sirloin that came with two types of sauces on the side a au poive pepper sauce and a red wine sauce that were both delicious. others in the party ordered the Salmon and Sea Bass that looked great. For side dishes we had the creamy spinach, lobster mashed potatoes  and sauteed mushrooms they seemed a little salty by themselves but with the steak it evened out nicely. For dessert we had the fried donuts that came with a banana and chocolate sauce. Not the cheapest meal to be had but certainly one of the best. I liked the atmosphere in the place it had a nice modern feel to it and the wavy wood panel ceiling was cool. Plus I was told they like hiring hostesses that are tall :)"

Embarrassing when you take a group of 11 people for a special event, make a reservation weeks in advance, then are being FORCED to sit at two separate tables, when there are multiple opportunities to fix the situation. We stood in the middle of the restaurant for 25 minutes while having to negotiate this, and the restaurant was HALF EMPTY (early pre-O dinner)... Calls to their HQ were answered with \"well, you ARE getting two tables not too far from each other, aren't you?\" Their only saving grace? The food was good and the servers gracious - that will not change my opinion about this company who operates multiple outlets in the best Casinos on the Strip and elsewhere...

However, being a Los Angeles native with many years of Vegas experience, I consider \"FIX\" to be the typical trap. \n\nNone of their dishes are stand-outs that you would go to Fix for because they specialize in something special. Nearly everything they serve can be had much better or cheaper somewhere else. The steak, yes it was good, but if I want a killer steak for cheaper actually, I'd walk north on Paradise for a couple blocks and sit down at Ruth's Chris. \n\nI sat with a big party and was able to try a variety of dishes. I personally had the sea bass, which was served on a bed of risotto It was tasty but the small size and \"average\" dish didn't warrant a $48 price tag. \n\nThe drinks carry your typical Vegas price tag. For a Dewar's on the rocks and a Saphire tonic, the price without tip was $27.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food was good, but the prices are simply outrageous for dishes I can get better at other high-end restaurants."

We had a fabulous evening with delicious food and drink- and awesome service from Tommy, our server (as well as the rest of the staff).  We made a reservation for 6:30 pm and were seated immediately.  There were lots of options and LOTS of things that looked delicious!  We ended up choosing the items below:\n\nKale Caesar Salad-  Delicious! The kale combined the anchovy dressing dressing made for an interesting take on a classic!  The kale was crisp and fresh, and little squares of cheese and croutons made for a nice start to the evening.  We decided to share- and they even split it for us!\n\nBone-in Rib-eye- Perfect.  It was medium rare-just as ordered. Red/Pink on the inside and a nice char on the outside. Again, Perfect.  I went sans sauce- because I think good meat doesn't need sauce- but the Chimichurri sauce was ordered and I tried it with my steak, and it was quite good.  The steak also had two thin and tasty salt and vinegar chips on top- together they were QUITE delicious! The only rib-eye I've had better was at Ruths Chris.\n\nUltimate Very Adult Mac and Cheese- Think Macaroni Mozzarella Stick-esqe with a cheese dipping sauce. It's not what I was expecting- but was very pleasantly surprised none-the-less.  I love Mac and Cheese- and I LOVED this!!\n\nSteak and Maine Lobster - I did not order this- but I have to say it looked very good.  I tried a bite of the lobster (and I don't really enjoy lobster),and this was quite tasty.  The filet and lobster were both sizable portions as well.\n\nCreamed Spinach - I've had great creamed spinach- and then I had this.  Adding the cheese was an extra oomph that made me not want to stop eating it (we should have got 2!)\n\nTiramisu with Blueberries- It was good. Of all the things that we had- while good, was the least memorable.  I was sold when they said blueberries in Tiramisu, and again was quite good.  I think I would try the Banana Bread Pudding next time (although- I don't remember seeing it on the dessert menu.)\n\nDonuts- It was my birthday and they surprised me with a warm sugary donuts with dipping sauces. The apple dipping sauce with the donuts was incredible- would definitely have this again!\n\n\nI will say- the prices are on the higher side, but we were completely aware and satisfied with what we ordered for the price.  It was a treat- but not someplace that we could eat every night.  We will definitely be back!"

While cruising the Bellagio, I saw this joint, and immediately made reservations for night two.\n\nIt was a Saturday night, and this place was just packed with beautiful people.  We had reservations for 8:30, but didn't get seated until about 8:50.  No big deal, we had some great drinks, and one of our party was asked to kiss a bachelorette party bride-to-be. It was an absolute riot, and we made quite a scene.  \n\nWe finally were seated, ordered more drinks and placed our appetizer order.  We opted for the buffalo wings and beef carpaccio. Before our order arrived, I gave my buddy a hard time for ordering buffalo wings at such a nice joint, before an evening of going out. Once the order arrived, I took back everything I said. The wings were outstanding.  I can't do them justice by trying to describe them here.  Just do yourself a favor and try them.  They were very unique, and were served with an amazing blue cheese dip.  The carpaccio was also fantastic.  They were served with a truffle infused olive oil, and capers.  The meat was insanely delicious and very fresh.  I could have eaten 5 plates. :)\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the rib eye, medium rare.  It was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the side of hand cut fries that I got as an accompaniment were really tasty.  The guys also got the drunken lobster with gnochi, and the burgers (sliders) that I got a small bite of, which were very well done (and even would be worth ordering as an appetizer, as you get 3 sliders with the order).\n\nGreat food, awesome ambiance, right in front of the night club Bank (which they got us on the guest list for), and is open to the casino floor, so you can people watch while you eat.  Love this spot, and would definitely come back.  In fact, I will definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas."

The reason I'm knocking one star off a 5 star review, is because 5 of us ordered the rib eye (delicious), two of us medium and three of us medium rare and by the end of the meal, we were pretty convinced that the two mediums got the medium rares and the one guy who really wanted a medium rare got the medium.

I kid you not, it was a $16 4 oz piece of chicken added to my $16 salad. Similarly, the waitress offered my friend another soda - which we later found was not a refill, but a new $4.50 soda. When we raised this to our waitress, she sent over the manager. To our shock and surprise when we raised these points to him, not once did he apologize but went further in regards to the chicken to reply \"it can't just be complimentary\". Yes, thank you...

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the price tag. \n\nIt's unfortunate that a restaurant that was so well designed opened up onto an odd end of the casino, where the slots meet the mall. And of course diners are seated casino-wards, instead of tucking people back in against the well-designed interior walls. \n\nAnd no draft beers at all, only $20 cocktails and $25 glasses of wine."

My husband arrived at least 20min ahead and ordered a couple of things it took almost 40-50mins for his order to arrive. We got there ordered a few items and they came faster than his, hence the comp from the mgr. He made a modification to the slider and it came out wrong. The fried mac & cheese bars weren't worth it, the truffle oil is too strong. The burratta was AMAZING!!! Wrapped in phyllo and fried, yummy!!! The crab cake poppers were ok, but the gravy underneath was tasteless and sparse. Creamed spinach was ok, crispy tuna was ok, spiced fries didn't really have any spice to them. Wouldn't try again."

Die Ausstattung ist im gesamten dunkel gehalten, viel dunkles Holz sowohl am Boden als auch an der Decke und passt sich so der Umgebung des Casinos gut an, eine Seite des Restaurants ist offen gestaltet zum Casinobetrieb hin.\n\nNeben der regul\u00e4ren Speisekarte wird auch noch ein 3 G\u00e4nge Men\u00fc angeboten, es beinhaltet Auswahlm\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr Vor- und Hauptspeisen und kostet aktuell 60$/Person ohne Getr\u00e4nke.\n\nWir hatten uns f\u00fcr das Men\u00fc entschieden, die Speisen waren durchweg gut und sehr ansprechend in der Optik. Was positiv aufgefallen ist, der Service war zum einen gut ausgebildet und sehr z\u00fcgig.\n\nEine bessere Bewertung ist aus meiner Sicht nicht m\u00f6glich, da das FIX einen entscheidenden Nachteil hat. F\u00fcr ein gem\u00fctliches Dinner ist es einfach viel zu laut im Restaurant. Das liegt wohl zum einen an der Hintergrundmusik sowie an der Raumakustik, je weiter man sich zum Casino hin platzieren l\u00e4\u00dft, umso geringer ist das Problem denke ich, wobei dann die Ger\u00e4uschkulisse der Spielautomaten dominanter werden wird. Im hinteren Teil des Restaurants ist es jedenfalls kaum m\u00f6glich den umgebenden L\u00e4rm zu ignorieren, so kann man ein ruhiges und gem\u00fctliches  Essen zu zweit leider vollkommen vergessen.\n\nMein Res\u00fcmee f\u00fcr das Restaurant, gute K\u00fcche, aufmerksamer und schneller Service jedoch kein Ambiente, dass meinen Bedarf an Gem\u00fctlichkeit befriedigen kann. Schade!"

My friend and I were talking about how one of the things we don't enjoy in Vegas is having dinner in a dead mall.  Most of the restaurants that we enjoy always end up being in the mall and of course, no life around what so ever, so during dinner, we'll be looking outside and there's no one. We're in Vegas! We want the life and the hustling of people outside!\n\nComing here wasn't planned. We have heard of FIX in Bellagio being a great restaurant and just knew that it was your typical American food. The birthday girl wanted some great American food and some meat!  So between FIX and Tao Restaurant, we decided to go with FIX.\n\nComing here, our wait wasn't long, but we did happen to make a quick reservations before coming.  We were seated in a nice little booth and then the menus were presented to us.  \n\nThe menu of course was a bit pricey and a little pricier than we had expected.  \n\nThe boyfriend and I got the pork and the other couple got the filet mignon.  \n\nBoth were delicious!  Omg!  Both were cooked to perfection!  The pork, we actually had that cooked medium and it was very tender, juicy and flavorful!  It's always a hit or miss for me with pork at restaurants, but FIX does it really well!\n\nWe also got some sides: mashed potatoes, fried mac and cheese and asparagus.  \n\nThe mashed potatoes were smoked mashed potatoes and it truly had a smokey flavor to it which was interesting.  The asparagus had a truffle sauce that accompanied it which made it 100x better!  The fried mac and cheese wasn't really my favorite. But the boyfriend reallllly liked it!\n\nI wouldn't mind coming here again in the future! But of course, probably for an event."

The food was spectacular as well. If I could give them 10 stars, I would in a heartbeat without hesitation. Here's what went down:\n\nService: 5/5\nThey treat you with nothing but respect and kindness here. The minute you sit down, they lay down your cloth napkin in your lap and tuck in your chair. Tom, our waiter, was amazing the entire time... he's a natural at hospitality. He knew the menu like the back of his hand and was more than happy to answer any questions we had. He went into great detail about everything! He also had some help from another waiter who was also very kind to us. He noticed we were sharing our entrees and offered to serve us our scallops and seabass. So nice!\n\nAmbiance: 4/5\nI'm biased against really dark lighting and loud music. But the booth was really comfortable. It's definitely a hip place to eat with a fancy flare added to it. \n\nPrice: 4.5/5\nItems are on the pricier side of things, but the care and attention the chef gave to each dish we had warrants the pricing choices. \n\nFood: 5/5\nThe food was absolutely amazing. There was nothing that I didn't enjoy. We started off with the Very Adult Mac n Cheese with prosciutto and truffle oil. It's similar to fried mozzarella sticks except when you bite into it, you are met with decadent and creamy mac n cheese! The outer crust is perfectly fried and the inside is rich. It comes with a side of cheese sauce. Make sure to have each bite with that amazing sauce. The waiter offered us more sauce, but we were fine with the amount they gave us. Again, great service! Next we ordered the seabass risotto with shrimp and lobster broth. That broth! Delicate and comforting! We also ordered the scallops benedict, which I adored! This has got to be in my top 3 best things I have ever eaten. The scallops were perfection, the potato pancake added a nice texture, and the crab hollandaise complimented the scallops very well. I almost didn't want to eat it knowing that by the end of the meal, it would all be gone! At this point we were really full, but Tom enticed us with the dessert menu. Tiramisu trifle it is! I normally don't like dessert, but this was something else! Great dessert to share. My compliments to the chef!\n\nNext time I'm in LV, I will not hesitate to come back. The combination of the exceptional service and the incredible food makes this my new favorite LV dinner spot."

I don't know why, but I felt that every server/busboy looked like they were rushing around.  Too many tables for each of them?  \n\nWe settled for the kobe sliders, cold seafood appetizer, and lobster tacos for our \"meal\".   BTW it took them 10 minutes to get back to us to take our order after we told them we were ready. \n\nThe lobster tacos are TINY but very flavorful.  The cold seafood appetizer is tiny as well but very fresh.  The kobe slider are delicious...but I love any burger.  Too bad they cooked it well done when I asked for medium rare. \n\nAfter you order, a busboy is pretty quick at taking away your plates and refilling your water but our server constantly looked busy.  \n\nOverall the food is MEH and after spending over $100 bucks at this place I felt like I stepped into an overpriced, loud, snobby nightmare."

I went in part because the buffet had a huge wait but I didn't want to spend more than the buffet would have cost. The reality is that is not really possible at Bellagio (hence the reason that the buffet line is so long). This was the next closest restaurant that I could find price wise. I had the penne pasta with prosciutto, peas, and what was supposed to be truffles, but really ended up being a dusting of grated truffle. 31 dollars later I only finished half of it because I was a little salty and frankly it wasn't worth 31 dollars. outside of the truffles this was a 12 dollar olive garden caliber pasta (I didn't even really taste the truffles).\n\nThe creme brule desert was actually pretty good. Would I go back there? Maybe, but there are entirely too many other places in Vegas to try that I don't see a reason or need to do that."

I read many reviews and decided FIX sounded like something we would enjoy. I wanted to go somewhere nice, but not too fancy. I don't like super fancy restaurants or gourmet food. I like a good steakhouse with menu items I can identify. The menu I saw online, seemed easy with a few fancy things I didn't mind trying. I made reservations online and when the show was over we headed to FIX. We were seated immediately and our waiter was very attentive. We ordered a glass of wine each on the ipad menu. The decor was great. Dimly lit, but our table looked out toward the casino floor. The music was upbeat, but not too loud as some reviews complained. We ordered the lobster tacos, kobe sliders, mac n cheese and mushrooms. The lobster tacos were very small, but WONDERFUL! We both agreed that the size was deceiving, because each had so much flavor and was just enough for the two of us. The Kobe sliders were juicy and delicious. The mushrooms were also very good. The adult mac n cheese was pretty good, but I didn't finish them. Nothing too special about them. Our bill was about $100 but worth it and made our date night that much more fabulous. We will definitely go back and recommend to friends. We are still dreaming of those lobster tacos!"

Both dishes were phenomenal.  We were closely attended to by all of the staff during our whole meal.

We had a reservation for a party of 20, if your entire party can't make it there is a $40 fee per empty seat. Our party was seperated into 3 tables, they have no large tables there. After being seated we where greeted by several waiters, they share the tables. We were served by a very mean waiter. He gave us total attitude, forgot to take one persons order at our table. We waited 30 mintues for our food. While the other two tables ate we sat staring at each other. I spoke to the manager about our horrible service and he apologized, of course. Out of our three tables mine was the only one that added the tip to our bill. So my thinking is because we didn't not order as much liquor as all the other tables and I spoke to the manager, they then added the tip to my bill to guarantee they got something out of us. My aunt told me that because Vegas really has know gauranteed customer returns there is no need to try to impress the customer. SO TRUE.  I do not recommend anyone eating here at FIX. The food was pricey and really didn't taste that great. Service was horrible to say the least and if there was a star that gives a 1/2 Star I would have choosen that."

I loved design of the ceiling in particular. The menu was good and the food was equally good. No disappointments here.\n\nService. Sigh...service was a big let down! We sat at a table and watched a booth next to where we were seated turn over twice before we even received our bill. We honestly felt like because 18% gratuity was automatically being added to our bill (for parties of 8 or more) that the server wasn't interested in making sure we were having an enjoyable meal. \n\nWe had a problem getting separate checks, which I can understand, but all-in-all this is a restaurant I will never go back to and I would not recommend it to anyone. \n\nThe manager, who was apologetic and nice enough, brought a round of shots for the table to make it up. We left the shots. If you wanted to make it right, you would have acknowledged that this could have been avoided had you been walking the dining room to check on the tables instead of manning the host desk and chatting with the 20 something year-old hostesses. I realize it's a difficult job to manage a restaurant, but at least make an effort. Try being proactive instead of reactive and expect that a round of shots will make it right.\n\nI went to Mon Ami Gabi (across the strip at the Paris) for lunch the following day and I was blown away by the service! Fix--you need to remember that people pay for more than ambiance and food, we expect service too, and in absence of that, we will go elsewhere.\n\nThumbs down FIX and do yourself a favor and go have a drink or a meal at Mon Ami Gabi and take notes...take copious notes!!!"

The food was on point, but the overall experience was just ok.\n\nFor foods, we had an array of cheeses and wines.  Hot food wise, we had some of the best hors d'oeuvres.  Let's first start with the crab cake sliders.  ON POINT!  Nicely toasted bread, stuffed with sliced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, bacon, crab cakes and a nice aioli sauce.  The crab cakes were filled with meat and not too much filler.  I truly appreciated the different textures this slider offered, from the toasted bread, to the semi crunchy crab cake and the refreshing lettuce.  Don't be fooled though, the crab cakes truly are the stars in this dish!  We also had the adult mac and cheese.  The components of mac and cheese, formed into small square bites and breaded/fried, served with a butter dipping sauce.  To me, I wasn't crazy about those bites.  Seemed like the macaroni or whatever pasta used was stuffed together and condensed, not fluffy which then made the dish really dense and not light as I would have liked it.\n\nAnother highly recommended dish we had was the lobster tacos!  SOOOO good.  The lobster meat and fixings in the shell was cool and refreshing.  There was a lot of lobster meat in those small taco shells which was a treat in itself.  Super crunchy and held up to my expectations.  I LOVED this dish!  Lastly, we had the beef sliders.  Although a small slider, the beef patty was thick and perfectly cooked.  Accompanied with a thousand island type sauce, melted cheese, tomato slice and pickle chip.  The burger was juicy, the bun was toasted nicely with butter and baked to perfection!\n\nMy only downfall to the ambiance was the staff.  I understand we were with a group of 50 and kind of drunk, but they were told well in advance. The place was really dark and too intimate for what we were there for, so it brought down my vibe just a little. The servers were cordial, but the bartenders were a little rude.  When asked for water, they were a little impatient as it wasn't bringing them any revenue.  The manager was a little pushy when it came to us, but totally understandable as their other guests were staring at us.  The manager's intentions were to keep us in our section so we don't disturb the other guests and I can appreciate that.  \n\nTrust me when I say, the food alone will bring me back.  I'm sure it'll be pricey, but when I think of those crab cake sliders or lobster tacos, I can't help but run to Fix!  I invite you to visit this place for the food!!  You will not be disappointed."

I'm up for that music when I'm dancing in a nightclub, not when I'm eating my dinner.\n\nFoodwise..they get a thumbs up! For an appetizer we got the lobster taco. Yummy, but you get 4 bite sized tacos for the hefty price of $22...not worth it. The $18 French Dip is worth every penny and then some! Best I've ever had! Thick slices of steak that melted in your mouth with every bite, sandwhiched between a soft chewy baguette. bread! \n\nDo not try any of the signature cocktails...We tried half the menu and they just got worse as we kept ordering.

There are so many great places to eat, so do your research and find the place for you. Fix seemed to meet all my expectations. So, I made reservations as soon as I decided on the place. I am glad I did. When we arrived, the place already looked pretty full. Note that Fix is no place to have a quiet, calm dinner. It's basically a restaurant that is preparing you for the fun and loudness that you will get into later in the night. Their menu isn't too big, but still has a good selection - sushi, salad, steaks, seafood, and sides. The other thing to note about Fix is that you don't have just one waiter and one server waiting on you. It seems like a whole team. Every time someone took our order, brought us something, asked how we were doing, and brought our check it was a different person. Weird, but hey, they got the job done. We ordered drinks - mojitos, whiskey, and champagne. My friends ordered the Truffle Pasta, Scallops, Sushi, and some sides. I got the Scallops and a side of asparagus. I had been eating and drinking all day, so a steak sounded good, but just not what I wanted at the time. Everything was delicious. Very good. Added perk to our experience? Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel were there dining as well. We didn't bother them, since we didn't even know at the time. But later when we did find out, I thought, hey, if it's cool enough for them, it's cool enough for me. Glad we ate here and I am especially glad we had a good experience."

I have to admit I dined at Range in SF the same week where we paid about half as much (it's Michelin star) and the food was twice as good. \n\nThe service was relatively snappy although there were pacing issues at the beginning. About 1/3 of the way through the meal the servers got it back together at which point everything was right on. They're certainly nice enough, but did nothing memorable - I also felt their wine knowledge was a bit rehearsed as opposed to experienced. \n\nThe restaurant itself is tucked next to the Casino in the Bellagio, which means if you sit near the exterior of it your looking out onto the casino, which isn't a memorable view if you ask me. The restaurant across the casino, called something Fish (yellow fish maybe? I can't remember) has views of the fountains outside (although the service there was much much worse). \n\nBut I guess this is Vegas, and this is what people expect.

The place was packed, not very social, but our waiter made sure we got into Pure with some free passes and VIP entrance for everyone at the table.  How's that for service?\n\nThe only caution I would make is to bring your own wine.  The markup on their bottles is SIGNIFICANT... more than I've seen anywhere.

There were pictures of Rachel Bilson and even Paris Hilton celebrating parties there, so we felt that it must be good. FIX was described as having gourmet \"college food\". It definitely had those bad things we all loved in college when we had no time to cook. We ordered the Mini Kobe Burger sliders, and the famed Buffalo Chicken wings. We even ordered some fries, which came in a cute little swirl like container. All of the food we ate was good. The price can be on the upper side, but it's still a nice trendy place to eat at in the Bellagio. I might suggest eating the steak, since it is also advertised as having one of the best steak in Vegas (as do many restaurants by many different critics!)"

It was probably 8 ounces BEFORE cooking, because it didn't appear to be more than 6 ounces by the time it hit our plates. There was NO FLAVOR at all to them, but they WERE TENDER.\n\nAlso ordered their HUGE baked potato and we split it. A tray came out with it with small medium-size cups containing soft butter, bacon, chives and sour cream so that we could load the potato as we wished. That was a nice touch.\n\nIt said that we could order a Maine lobster tail on the side for an extra $25.00. Foolishly I anticipated a nice 6 - 8 ounce lobster tail and cooked to perfection. WRONG! The lobster tail couldn't have been more than 3 ounces of lobster meat! There was enough lobster meat for THREE VERY SMALL BITES. Seriously - not an exaggeration at all. Included with the lobster meat, there were 3 small pieces of asparagus and 2 tiny shitake mushrooms. \n\nFor dessert, I had a piece of pumpkin pie, which was VERY tiny.\n\nWe each had just water to drink, and the bill came to over $166.00. + gratuity, so our total bill was just under $200.00.\n\nThe service WAS good though."

Essentially a nightclub that happens to serve food, Fix is as much about what you look like and who you're with as it as about the food.  The room is gorgeous, and the curvy wooden ceiling which is the centerpiece of the restaurant supposedly cost about a million bucks by itself.  Almost as good looking as the physical space are the people who inhabit it.  Fix is always packed with some seriously good looking people (a large share of whom are celebrities of some sort) who come to fill up before going to out to hit the clubs.  \n\nGiven that I've spent the first half of this review talking about everything but the food, you'd almost expect it to a.) be beside the point, and b.) suck in a very expensive way,  So how is it?  Think comfort food meets nouveau rich (kobe chili cheese fries, truffled mac and cheese) that's very very well executed.  My recommendation is to go with meat, specifically the ribeye (get it sliced and seared), since the steaks here are aged USDA prime, and are actually better than what you get at Smith and Wollensky or the equivalent.   Desserts, punctuated by donuts that put Krispy Kreme to shame, are another high.  Bonus points for service that's essentially perfect and lacks the pretension usually found at places like these. Best of all, Fix has a late night menu they serve until 1am on weekends.\n\nSo in summary, it's not cheap, but if you like good food and good looking people, there's really nowhere better to go.\n\n(PS - If you're a group of a good looking girls, call ahead and they'll give you some seriously special treatment.)"

We had a table of four, and found out that we would have two servers waiting on our table that evening! How great! We placed our orders, got our drinks and appetizers in reasonable time, but when the entrees were served, items were missing, and some items we didn't order were on the table? Oddly, the two servers that were helping us were then nowhere to be found...gone! Someone else finally came over and took over as our server. When we explained that we were missing items that we ordered, we were brought over another item that we didn't order. This was ridiculous considering now we were one of two tables occupied in the restaurant. We ate our food, which really was pretty delicious, and after the meal we still had a few items left over.  When someone came over to remove plates, they asked if we would like to have the items boxed up. We said yes. The new server, came back with a check, we paid, and never saw the boxed up food? So again, we had to ask...someone said they were going to box up our food, but they never came back with it? The server went in the back and 'found it'. I really hope it didn't come out of the garbage, but the service was so horrible at 'Fix' that I wouldn't doubt it. The Bellagio has many restaurants with delicious food available, but if you'd like to be treated with some respect and not like a 21 year old drinking your first few beers...don't go here. 'Yellowtail' is fantastic and is straight across from 'Fix'. Both 'Jasmine' and 'Le Cirque' are incredible as well."

Creamy, cheesy and flavorful.\n\nThe Wedge: Fresh and loaded.\n\nPro Flat Bread: Cracker type bread (although delicious) with fresh arugula.\n\nChicken Wings!!!!..: Oh. My. So good. I don't usually like chicken wings. It takes too much effort - like eating an ear of corn. These chicken wings were awesome though. Stick it in your mouth, pull the bone out and done. You have easy bite-sized, deliciously flavored, tender meat.\n\nMaybe I like this place so much because I wasn't paying the bill. But hey... it's Vegas. \n\nI really didn't think this meal was going to be as pleasing as it was. Recommended!"

The ambiance was very nice and trendy. I decided to have a salad and the Tomahawk veal chop. The salad was decent, its just a salad after all. The veal chop in which I got medium rare was cooked as I liked it so I was excited to get my first bite. The veal wasn't as juicy as I thought it would be, and the taste of the meat just didnt' come out at me as I had expected. The food wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't on par with the price of $47."

I ordered the filet, 5 oz that came with a great sauce. Unfortunately, when the sauce ran out the meat itself was rather dry, something you wouldn't expect with a filet. The chicken my partner ordered was also pretty dry without the sauce.\n\nDesserts were excellent, but a little small. For example, there were only two donuts to go with a lot of dipping sauces.\n\nBtw, the tap water the serve seems to be unfiltered, it has that rather odd Las Vegas taste to it. I'd recommend ordering a cocktail or wine.\n\nThe service for us was excellent and attentive, and the restaurant itself is beautiful. I just wish the food was better given the price."

So excited to get it because like I said our stomachs were basically eating it selves. We get them, it's only four tacos, which is fine two for each right?

I particularly recommend the tomato soup starter -- the soup tastes like a good cheese pizza without the crust, and it comes with an impeccable grilled cheese sandwichlet.  The crispy chicken is also surprisingly good; no breading, just a crispy skin.  But then I've eaten here twice and neither my wife nor I ever had anything you could call a dud.\n\nHowever, nothing is over-the-top great, and with a prominent bar, TV screens, no tableclothes, etc., it doesn't feel like a fancy restaurant, and you just don't feel your $60-$80 per person was well spent, even at the Bellagio."

Here's where you go for that divine experience.\n\nNow on to the food.  For appetizers, my party of 7 shared the crabcakes and egg rolls.  The crabcakes were damn good, but a bit hard to maneuver.  It's doesn't have much girth, but is like 4 inches high.  So imagine stuffing that sucker down your throat (I know, I know, I couldn't resist with the terminology).  Great nonetheless.

It went really well together! \n\nMy husband and I  shared their special $90.00 steak medium well. They say it's good for two but I can see three people eating it.

The lobster mash was a little bland and cucumber martini I liked but it was weird and my co-worker took a sip and throught it was gross. I like weird things sometimes. Of course it was Vegas and overpriced but the scallops really were pretty perfect. However, you only get three and I am a big eater and left there kinda hungry.

My date had the scallops and he enjoyed them.  The prices are a little higher than expected giving the atmosphere.  The only things I was very surprised about was the noise level and how it completely opened up to the casino.  They had music blasting as if you were in a night club.  The servers had to scream to talk to you and you couldn't even have a conversation with your date.  I personally would not return for the noise level alone.  There are too many other places in Las Vegas with great service, food, and a lot more quieter."

We had the lobster tacos, the calamari, and the Kobe chili cheese fries. The tacos and the calamari were great. The calamari actually is probably some of the best I've had. The tacos were fresh and filled with lobster but really small. For $24 I'd probably choose something different next time. The chili cheese fries were disappointing and were our least favorite app.\n\nI went with the 28 day dry aged ribeye for my entree. The glaze on the steak was great and the steak was cooked perfectly. A very good quality steak but if you're going out specifically for steak there are better Vegas options. I still felt very satisfied with my order though.\n\nFor the sides we had the very adult mac and cheese and the smoked mashed potatoes. Both were outstanding. I'd come back to this restaurant for the mac and cheese alone and the mashed potatoes tasted like they'd been smoked for hours in my smoker. \n\nWe had the bread pudding, doughnuts, and the s'mores for dessert. Bread pudding was the table favorite and the doughnuts were our least favorite.\n\nAll in all Fix is a little on the pricier side but you get that you pay for. The quality of the food and the creativity of the chef make Fix and good place to check out if you're hungry in the Bellagio."

            "review": "With plans to visit Bellagio to see O and possibly check out a club, our bachelorette party group of four ended up at Fix for dinner. Before my arrival I'd already written the place off as overpriced and overrated. In my personal opinion, it still was overpriced however I did have an enjoyable meal and a nice experience.\n\nWe were seated immediately in a large booth in the center of row of the restaurant against the wall. We were tucked away from other groups and had a nice intimate experience, well as intimate as you can get facing out towards the casino floor and slot machines. Overall the atmosphere was very posh. The ceiling was wood paneled and not evenly tiered across the restaurant, giving the place a unique look. Of course there was some mood lighting to set the scene. \n\nThe service was a combination of attentive yet too cool to care. Those sound contradictory, however our needs were met without feeling smothered by an overly friendly, personable waiter. We were expecting a fifth to our group and they did do a great job keeping an eye on timing both in a sense of moving forward with our order and waiting for an extra guest. We had multiple people checking on our table, none of whom really stood out or made an sort impression. \n\nWe started with a round of cocktails. I went with the Raging Berries which consisted of Veev, Stoli Blueberi, Lemon Juice, Blackberries, Sage Simple Syrup, Blueberry Red Bull and Fresh Blackberries. It was very refreshing and not as sweet as the description would lead you to believe. It wasn't too strong which was a little disappointing. \n\nOur group started with the Ultimate Very Adult Mac and Cheese as an appetizer. I was expecting a noodle dish versus fried cheese sticks. It worked out well that there was four to the plate and four in our group. It was tasty but really nothing to write home about. I'd call it a glorified mozzarella stick. \n\nFor my main, I went with the Braised Lamb Cavatelle Pasta. I think the quality of this dish really swayed my opinion about Fix into the four star category. They did not skimp on the lamb and it came in absolutely delicious morsels. Now talking about decent size portions, there was a ton of pasta. I certainly did not walk out hungry! The lamb, roasted butternut squash, ricotta and garlic bread crumbs really complimented each other and made it a cohesive dish.\n\nWith a night of drinking ahead of us, we skipped the desserts and left to catch our show.\n\nWhile I probably wouldn't return to Fix, I was happy with my experience and my dinner and think it's worth checking out if it fits your budget."

My buddy and I showed up without a reservation at 8pm last Friday and were told it would be an hour wait, no problem, hello craps table. We returned about 45 minutes later and grabbed a drink at the bar, after a drink or two I noticed it was 9:15 so I went to see what the hostess had to say. Long story short people with reservations had been waiting over an hour, but somehow we were seated about 5 minutes later... who knows. Anyway, the food is awesome, we couldn't get past how good all of the appetizers looked, so we just ordered a ton of them and shared everything. Everything was great, especially the lobster tacos. They also served baked-potato break, yes you read that right and I know how it sounds, but give it a chance before you judge... its awesome.

My mom was excited about the meal all day and couldn't wait for the show to be over so that we could eat. \n\nFIRST, let's get this out of the way now. Yes, it's an expensive restaurant and yes the items are pricey. However, I feel that if a restaurant can justify their prices with flavor and quality, then it's worth it. Fix was WORTH IT in my opinion. \n\nI was honestly more excited about drinks and dessert, so I didn't order an actual \"meal.\" I ordered the Yellowtail Jalapeno Sashimi and the Sausage Flatbread pizza. I thought the Sashimi was EXCELLENT. The blend of vinegar dressing with the fresh jalapeno and fresh fish was superb. The pizza was also great. I also had some of the Kobe Beef Chili that we ordered for the table, and HOT DAMN...that was probably the best chili I've ever consumed in my life. It had a savory sweetness to it that complemented the kobe so perfectly - YUMMMMMO!!\n\nNow, as for drinks and desserts, BEST $100 I've ever spent in my life (well I should say best $100 my parents ever spent ON MY LIFE)! I had 3 martinis ($20/each), but all were surprisingly strong. I don't mind spending an arm & a leg on drinks, as long as there is more alcohol in them, which was defintely the case. I had the cucumber martini (with fresh cucumber & cherry tomatoes), extra dirty belvedere (they didn't have Ketel One surprisingly), and an Espresso martini. \n\nWe also ordered 3 desserts for the table (all $10) and they were all AMAZING. I have this weird geriatric affinity for bread pudding and have to order it at any restaurant that offers it, and this was THE BEST I EVER HAD (yeah, just had a Drake moment right there). It was just sheer perfection. They also have fresh sugar donuts that come with chocolate and peanut butter dipping sauce which were also really good. Last was the Alaskan Strawberry dessert that was surprisingly good considering they probably didn't use fresh strawberries (considering it's November in Vegas). \n\nALL IN ALL...TOP 5 MEAL I'VE EVER CONSUMED!"

The risotto was a little mushi (definitely not al dente) but sauce it was in was pretty good. My friend had the steak and he said it definitely beat out some of the bigger named steak houses who charge upwards of $75 for a piece of crap slice of beef. He eats out pretty frequently so... I let you interpret that.\n\nI will try this place again if I stay at the Bellagio. We got turned down at their 4 diamond restaraunt since it was a busy Saturday night in vegas."

            "review": "It was a long week in Vegas, but this place certainly helped to take a major piece of the edge off. It was a group dinner, so we were afforded the convenience of the private room. The main dining area is a bit to close to the main casino floor, and the ambient music is a bit too uptempo for quiet, classy, dinner...but then again, this is Vegas.\n\nThe menu is a bit all over the place, but if you know where to look the options can be quite fulfilling. My advice is to trust your waiter. We were directed to the lobster tacos as an appetizer. I thought this seemed a bit rudimentary for such an upscale, but I was pleasantly surprised. The serving size, style, and taste were all 5 star.\n\nFollowing the appetizers we were told that the house specialty were the steaks. I opted for the New York Sirloin and it was brilliant. The side sauces added the cherry on top. The sides we selected were the lobster mashed potatoes, House Steak Fries, Asparagus, and Mac and Cheese*. The Mac and Cheese gets a special note for being fantastic.\n\nWe finished the night with dessert and coffee, and man-oh-man I wish I had saved a bit more room. We put one of each on the table to share and I was not disappointed with anything. If you can make it to the Bellagio I suggest stopping in."

My dad ordered the filet mignon and tripled fried fries. Let me tell you, those fries were incredible and I can't compare them to anything because they are on their own level. Highly suggest ordering them! The filet was cooked perfectly and does not need any sauce as it is good on its own. I ordered the salmon which was cooked perfectly - flakey yet crisp on the outside. Love the bean salad and truffle oil vinaigrette. \n\nService: This was my only complaint - every 3 bites someone would come and ask how the food is. I love when waiters and waitresses are attentive but when you can't go a few minutes without being checked on it just seemed like an overkill. Again, some people will love this but it was difficult to eat and have a conversation."

            "review": "On Sunday, 6/15/14, my girlfriend and I decided to hit up the FIX located at the Bellagio for a late night dinner. Earlier in the day/evening we attended a wedding at the Tropicana. My girlfriend was actually a bridesmaid. I didn't get to eat that much cheat food during the day so I was really looking forward to ordering a lot of food at the FIX. I looked at the menu and checked out the pictures on yelp about two weeks prior to our Vegas trip. I thought the menu had a lot of good food dishes to choose from. I honestly thought the FIX was going to be an excellent dining experience but it was everything but that! \n\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived at Fix around 10:30 pm. I made a reservation off of opentable which is my go to website for making reservations. We could here music playing as we walked up to the FIX. The restaurant had an open feature design. The lighting was very dim and it reminded me of a club rather than a restaurant. The FIX had a bar/lounge area to the right of the restaurant. The hostess section didn't make since to me. You have to walk up an incline area leading up to the hostess. Once we were checked in, we were escorted to our table. As we were walking to our table I noticed a platform step where someone could easily trip over. One of the waiters even said while pointing at the platform step, \"Watch your step.\" I thought the design of the restaurant was just okay. I get it, it's in Vegas and most of the restaurants have that club/lounge type of atmosphere but there was nothing special about this restaurant. The dining tables and booths were just average to me. \n\nFood:\n\nLet me start off like this. The food at the FIX was a huge let down! I'm actually pretty mad and pissed off because this was the last meal of my cheat day. I started off with the Bobby Baldwin Burger (kobe sliders, aged cheddar, grilled onions, spiced fries.) This is FIX'S signature dish. A lot of people rave about this dish and I had very high expectations for it. The sliders were mediocre at best. It honestly didn't taste like high quality kobe beef. They definitely weren't the best slider/burgers I've eaten. The sliders didn't have that wow factor and they were way overpriced for almost $30! The spiced fries were decent tasting. \n\nFor my main entree I decided to go with the Crispy Skin Pork Shank (Sweet Corn Spoon Bread, Creamed Collard Greens, Southern Mustard BBQ Sauce) and a side of Ultimate Very Adult Mac & Cheese (with truffle oil & prosciutto). First off, I'm a huge fan of pork. I love pork! I love pork dishes! This pork shank was horrible and nasty! The outer layer of the pork shank was way too crispy and inedible! I know this was a crispy pork shank but I think they went over board on the crispy concept, literally! Once you get past the outer layer crispy part of the pork shank, there was more of a carnitas textures. I would of been thrilled if the pork shank tasted like carnitas but it didn't. The pork didn't taste old but it didn't taste right. There was something off with the taste of the pork. The creamed collard greens were whatever. I had a few bites and that was enough. The southern mustard BBQ sauce didn't taste like BBQ at all. It tasted like a strong brown mustard. The sweet corn spoon bread didn't taste good as well. Another thing, the pork shank was way overpriced. I have no problem spending money on good food but spending money on bad food just doesn't make since. \n\nService: \n\nThere were two waiters that waited on us throughout the night. They were both friendly and polite. They seemed to like their jobs very much. There was nothing wrong with the service. \n\nOverall: \n\nIf you are visiting Las Vegas or staying at the Bellagio, I would avoid eating at the FIX. There are hundreds of better restaurant in Vegas. The FIX is way overpriced and their is nothing special about the restaurant. I hope they take the Crispy Skin Pork Shank off the menu because it is horrible! I would of definitely sent the pork shank back but I had a $75 dining credit from the Bellagio so I decided not to. The FIX needs to seriously \"FIX\" their menu, recipes and the overall concept of the restaurant."

I doubt few go back after the 1st time. Horrible service and food. \n\nFood - Chili Cheese Fries: Fries tasted like they had been cooked 3 days prior and stale. Cheese - not for sure exactly what it was but it was not cheese. I've had canned chili taste better than what they provided. \nAdult Mac & Cheese - a twist on overpriced cheese sticks. Lobster tacos - I didn't realize taco shells came in that small of a size. \n\nService - it didn't exist. We sat in the lounge area of the bar where there are tables. The waitress moved a guy, there by himself, to sit a large group and then they ended up not being able to sit in the bar because of some being underage. They took the poor guys menu and never brought him his drink. We asked him to join us thinking his service would improve but all four of us ended up having very little to no service. \n\nMy advice - don't waste your time as you will be greatly disappointed!"

Executive Chef Renieri Caceres of Fix had picked some dishes he wanted us to try and we added some others from the menu.\n\nThe items we had consisted of five appetizers, two mains, and three desserts.  The dishes were:\n\nAppetizers:\n\nLobster tacos with grilled mango and cilantro\nProsciutto wrapped dates with chorizo, roasted piquillo & San Marzano sauce\nDuck prosciutto flatbread with Fromage Blanc, onions, Pecorino cheese, and Rocket Greens (from the menu)\nWood grilled bruschetta with Greek yogurt, citrus, and blackberry jam\nUltimate very adult mac and cheese with truffle oil and prosciutto\n\nThe two main dishes were:\n\nDuck and waffles, confit with a fried egg and maple bourbon syrup\n100 day dry aged bone in rib eye with lobster mashed potatoes and sweet corn spoon bread\n\nThe desserts were:\n\nChocolate s'mores with flourless cake, graham crunch, burnt fluff, and milk chocolate pudding\nWarm banana bread with coconut ice cream and Malibu Anglaise\nWarm apple pie filled doughnuts with rum raisin and cinnamon apple dipping sauces.\n\nIn addition, we had iced tea and I had a plain coffee after dessert.\n\nWe were greeted at the podium at 8 and shown to our table by a pleasant hostess and were soon taken care of by a great team of servers who were excellent.  Iced tea glasses were replaced before finishing the one we were drinking, water glasses were kept filled, and the table was cleaned between each course with politeness and great finesse.\n\nThe dishes were all very good.  The only dish I thought wasn't very successful were the lobster tacos.  The bruschetta was excellent.  I asked about the round yogurt balls in EVOO and the server explained the technique for making them.  Spread on the grilled bread and topped with some blackberry jam, marvelous!  Not to be outdone, the prosciutto wrapped dates with chorizo were large and very tasty.\n\nIn the main, the duck was wonderfully done with a crispy skin and the waffles were quite good.  The amazing thing was the 100 day dry aged ribeye, something that we were told was a special.  It was tomahawk style, sliced from the accompanying bone as providing approximately a dozen medium rare slices of delicious beef with a flavor I haven't enjoyed before not having had beed aged that amount of time.\n\nThe desserts were amazing, too!  My favorite was the warm banana bread pudding with coconut ice cream and Malibu Anglaise.  The doughnuts were very good as was the s'mores.  Any one of the three would be worthy choices.\n\nTwo and a half hours later, we left, quite full and with a big smile from the delightful meal we had just finished.  Many thanks to the two chefs and a top notch crew for making dinner such a memorable event."

Other yelpers rave about them, but I wasn't that much of a fan to be honest.  The oysters, like all the others at the Bellagio, are cold water and smaller.  They are the better ones.  They were delicious, and only need a drop of lemon juice to bring out their flavor and full potential.  I also got a bowl of the tomato soup.  It was fantastic.  They gave you bacon and goat chese grilled cheese pieces on the side.  Was great to dip into the soup!\n\nFor the main course, I got the 10 ounce filet.  There was an option to go Oscar and get king crab on top of the steak.  I declined since I got the soup and I was already running out of storage space in the stomach.  Cutting into the steak showed that it was perfectly cooked.  It tasted fantastic!\n\nWe got the seasonal cobbler for dessert.  Holy sh*t.  One of the best cobblers I have ever had.  It barely made it around the table for everyone to try.  If you like cobblers or pie, or apples, GET THIS!\n\nI will surely be back if I am in the Bellagio again!"

The roasted potatoes were awful, the steaks wasn't even close to the temp I ordered, frankly you can get a better steak at Outback than you can here, and it won't cost you $70!  With all the options for high-end dining in Vegas, this place should be an option out of desperation.  I could go on about how terrible the food is here, but the bottom line is that the Bellagio should be embarrassed to have this place in their hotel.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to charge $50 - $100 for a steak, you better be able to cook the darn thing properly.  Your pork belly steam buns shouldn't taste like you purchased them at Sam's or Costco and nuked them to order, your \"shaved seasonal vegetable salad\" shouldn't be 6 pieces of shaved radish and a couple pieces of carrot.  This place is a total rip off.  Don't get me wrong, the manager comped my steak when he saw it, as he should have, but you can do so much better dining in Vegas than this place.

I'm writing this one only because the unhappy memories of dining at Fix have stayed with me for several days.  I understand that expensive food has become the norm in Vegas but more often than not when you spend more than $100 for food on the Strip you're likely to get something really good.  First of all, FIX looks great from the outside but from inside it's sort of a mess.  One half is way too dark so that you literally can't read what's in front of you and the other half is illuminated with the glare of slot machines.  It's really annoying.  I ordered the $18 Spring Roll appetizer which consisted of three, right of out of the box frozen, greasy, machine-made springs rolls.  It was really astonishing.  My entree was the Kobe sliders - something like $25.  I swear to God these are the same sliders you can buy at Costco, although my memory is that the one's you get at Costco taste better.  The buns were as generic as bread can possibly be.  Flavorless, dry, hard to swallow.  There was a little dab of mayo and a little slice of roma tomato on each one, plus one of them had a little purple string that we finally identified as a grilled onion.  The meat was tasteless.  The presentation was horrible. My fellow diner HATED his penne pasta entree and didn't finish half of it.  He said it was so salty it was inedible.  I would probably have complained but we had somewhere we need to be and just wanted to get out of there. The waiters were efficient. I felt back for them.

As a younger costumer I usually feel like less of a priority compared to older tables when I'm out to eat. However, the servers were helpful and attentive, appearing happy to help. The cocktails were fantastic! We started of with the focaccia with truffle, which was worth going back I Vegas for in itself!  \n\nThe ultimate Mac and cheese is a staple at Fix and was great as well! The sliders and mashed potatoes were delicious! The restaurant was pricey, but the food did not disappoint.\n\nWe ended dinner with coffee and the s'mores dessert. I HIGHLY recommend the s'mores dessert! Even when I was past full I could not stop indulging in it. Overall a great dinner!"

I had the filet mignon and mashed potatoes.  Which was actually pretty good! I didnt finish it all, and since we were going to the Bank afterwards, i couldnt take a to-go box, which still makes me sad (because i paid so much for it).  The only down side was the price.  This place is crazy expensive.  I can deal with pricey as long as the food is to die for, but it wasnt worth it.  I probably wont be back just because of that."

From their Kobe Beef sliders to their Lobster dishes to their Donuts, FIX never ceases to impress me with the simple ingenuity and creativity that goes into some of their dishes.  They take the idea of \"comfort food\" to a whole new level.  I do not want to repeat a lot of what has been said in previous reviews, but my recommendation is to definitely give this place a try (plan on spending $200-$250 for 3-4 people).  Their cocktails are nicely done in presentation, but nothing spectacular.  Anyways, to do it right, get an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  Otherwise you are missing out on the experience that is FIX."

As well it doesn't take long to get seated which I am glad to say otherwise there'd be less stars on this review.\n\nThe Fillet Mignon, best I've ever had, the lobster mash was a little on the salty side but I'm not there for the mashed potatoes. The lobster tacos are rather small but full of flavor and not overpowering. When they have Lobster Tail on the menu, it should be ordered by someone at the table so everyone can at least know what perfection is. My homeboy had it back in 2006 best thing on the menu but I haven't seen it since :( The desserts are awesome too. I don't like Creme Brulee but here I do. It was perfectly crisped top and not overly sweetened. Their chocolate syrup covered donut, indescribable. After eating here you will usually just want to fall in to a deep sleep to avoid anything ruining the perfect night.\n\nThe place is a bit higher priced than one might like but hey you're in Vegas, everything is overpriced. You come to Vegas to spend money with the delusion that you can make some back. I don't know anyone who goes to Vegas to \"save\" money. \n\nA cool byproduct of eating here is the celeb company. The first time I ate there I saw Alex Rodriguez (NY Yankees), the last time I saw Irv Gotti (Murder Inc.) havin dinner with Phil Ivey (World Series of Poker)."

This was by far the most decadent dessert I have ever had, and worth every penny of the $9 they charge for it....Their Shake and Cake was incredible too...Espresso Shake with a hot fudge brownie....WOW, their desserts were really off the chart!

I'm vegetarian but even without the prosciutto on it, it was seriously flawless and incredible. I'm looking for a recipe right now to try to recreate it. \n\nThe ambiance is a little loud and dark for a more adult crew, but for us it was fine.

After going thru the list of eateries a few times over, we settled on FIX as it seemed to offer the most of what everyone liked.  Now I was hungry but my friends were less so we had a lighter than normal meal overall.\n\nLocated right off the casino floor, FIX has the dimly lit atmosphere and styling of your typical overpriced LA restaurant accompanied by a menu that is primarily steak & seafood, aka American cuisine.\n\nIt seemed to cater to a slightly older crowd meaning mostly diners ranging from 30-50s and with that a pretty relaxed crowd with no booming music or crazy light shows...all that was provided for free from the casino floor.  You can dine either in the bar portion which has a few tables and be served by hot cocktail waitresses, or in the normal, much larger dining area and be served by more conventional servers.\n\nI ordered the trio wagyu beef sliders and 'adult mac n cheese'.\n\nThe beef sliders were alright, juicy and cooked with a healthy pink in the center, so nothing to complain about, they hit all the right notes but I wasn't wowed or felt like it was a party in the mouth.\n\nAdult mac n cheese - ok this was the anticpated party.  Basically I was served what looked like 3 giant fried & breaded mozzarella sticks and thought 'uh ok' picked one up and took a bite.  Wow.  Flavoured with white truffle essence, this were incredibly rich, intense, powerful sticks of bundled macarorrni floating in a cheesy suspension and they were damn good, in fact i took two of them to go and ate them on my walk back to my hotel down the strip.  \n\nMy friends ordered the beet & greens salad which was ok but not remarkable and the lobster tacos. Ok  at first I thought they were joking when the tacos arrived because they looked good...but were scaled for the size of 2 foot tall human beings, picking them up were a challenge as I kept worrying they would slip between the cracks of my fingers.  Again, they were decent but a little dissapointing due to do the size (but they did make for hilarious photo ops).  I scanned the other tables to see what their main entrees looked like and the various seafood, pasta and steak dishes looked like moderate to healthy sized portions, especially the two levels of 'surf n turf' I saw.\n\nWill I come back here?  Probably not, there was little in the experience to draw me back but what we had was interesting enough or at least provided us a good laugh which makes it sort of worth going once."

            "review": "The epitome of a Las Vegas Dining Tourist Trap.\n\nTheir menu is so unbelievably over-priced for uninspired food, presented under the guise of sophistication, that it borders on comical and is certainly cliched.\n\nWe ordered several appetizers for our party of 4, which we shared as our meal.\n\nSpicy Tuna: Great dish that is a common appetizer at many, many sushi places. A small dollop of spicy tuna served atop a deep-fried block of sushi rice. Tasted fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. At most places this is a $6 - 8 dollar appetizer. Here, its $25 - and you get 5 pieces that are about 1\" square. \n\nChopped Nicoise Salad: I don't even know where to begin with this one . . . the portion served was comparable to a side-salad you'd get at a place like Denny's. The ingredients were fresh and presentation was nice, I'll give it that, but was it worth $19? Unequivocally, no.\n\nKobe chili cheese fries: This might be the worst offender, which we ordered for the sheer comedy of it. I love how places add \"kobe\" to the listing and assume that this allows them to triple the price. Any restaurant who is using legitimate kobe beef, is: a) NOT going to grind it and b) NOT put it into CHILI. What you get here is a nicely arranged log cabin of french fries, a small crock of \"kobe\" chili, (aka steak timmings simmered in tomato sauce), and a little container of some sort of melted cheese sauce, which is most certainly more cream than cheese, as it never solidified despite sitting on our table for close to an hour. This was $21 - just under a buck a fry.\n\nThe \"Very adult\" mac and cheese: Ugh . . . I'm pretty sure I've seen these at Costco for something like $20 a case. Its macaroni and cheese, tossed with a piece or two of proscuitto, shaped into a log and deep fried. Please . . . Four pieces for $14\n\nBobby Baldwin Burgers: one of their \"signature\" dishes. All of the same as noted with the chili above applies here too. You get 3 sliders - which are exactly the same size as any other slider - for $31 dollars. That's $10 a piece. Absurdity.\n\nWhole roasted cauliflower: aside from the fact that a) you are served a CHOPPED head of cauliflower (contrary to the description of \"whole\"); b) there were no raisins or hazelnuts; and c) the menu SHOULD read \"brown butter bath\", this was the best appetizer we had. I don't know where they shop, but at my local Whole Foods, I can get a head of cauliflower for about $13 less than the $14 price, and I'm not buying by the case.\n\nDrinks/bar:\n\na) Hire a proper sommelier, please. The wine selection is very mediocre for Las Vegas, though the prices are far above average.\n\nb) Hire a proper mixologist, please. There are about 3 - 4 speciality cocktails, and they're rather uninspired. A pineapple mojito? Please.\n\nService: service was fine for our table. We weren't left wanting for anything, water was promptly refilled, and they were attentive. HOWEVER. Serious warning here:\n\nA food runner brought an appetizer to our table, set it down and walked away. One which we did not order, as this happened within several moments of us sitting down. About a minute later, just as we began to reach for the mystery appetizer, another waiter ran over, snatched up the plate and apologized that it had been given to the wrong table. The waiter then turned around, placed the very same appetizer that had just been sitting on our table, onto the table behind us. Not only is this likely a health code violation, its disgusting. We were immediately turned off and wondered where else our food had been prior to arriving at our table. The proper course of action here would have been to leave the appetizer with us and prepare a new one for the table who actually ordered it.\n\nThere is also clearly a ventilation problem in the kitchen. Its hot in Vegas. I know that. I live here. Our server, however, regularly came out of the kitchen, sweat dripping off his forehead and down his face. He was not the only one either. I tried (very hard) to not imagine the chef's sweat dripping into my food.\n\nAmbiance: note that the dining room is basically on the casino floor. If you like the smell of smoke wafting into your meal, the sounds of slot machines chiming away and passerby's staring at you as you eat, then this is the place for you.\n\nGrand total for 4 people: $240 with 18% tip. Again, none of us ordered an actual entree.\n\nI have no problem paying that much for a meal . . . its not the dollar amount thats the problem. Its what you get for that price. The food was very mediocre - not bad, but certainly not good either. Drinks were very substandard. Service was fine, but serious sanitary concerns. The only reason this place can charge as much as it does is because its on the strip and in the Bellagio. They're clearly catering to the tourist crowd looking for a fine-dining experience, hoping to capitalize on travelers who don't know any better. Everyone in our party left there feeling a bit cheated and blatantly robbed."

I selected the kobe sliders for my entree becuase it was one of the more basic items and was about middle of the road on prices. I loved the presentation and it was a good-sized portion altogether.\n\nThe dessert was fantastic.The chocolate brownie and espresso milkshake were chocolately, but not too sweet. It was a great ending to a lovely meal."

So we made 7:30 reservations and the place was empty. We were sat right next to the hostess table, where all the waiters and waitress congregated to bullshit, even though there were plenty of better oriented tables she could have sat us at. My husband got his little burgers and I got the filet and lobster. Neither of which were very impressive. My steak was overcooked to medium well (I asked for medium) and my poor husbands little burgers were nothing special at all. One good thing was the mac n cheese....that was tasty.We also had about 4 different servers so it was pretty hard to distinguish who ours was when we actually need refills and such."

I don' t know what the deal is with some of the restaurants in Vegas, but they tell you they are booked with reservations (when there are open tables) and then have you wait at the bar for all of 2.5 seconds (just long enough for you to order a drink, but not receive or pay for it) and then tell you they will seat you. Why so pretentious? Anyway, the meal overall was satisfactory, with one shining star: the penne with truffles, pancetta and peas. It was delicious and hit the spot. We were able to split this along with the fries, lobster tacos, and bread pudding. The other items were good (not great) but the pasta was by far my favorite. The bill was standard for Vegas--probably $120 for the both of us with drinks. Watch out for cocktails though, they will run you about $15 a pop. The husband loved his pineapple mojito, but I thought $15 was a little much for a Vodka (house) soda with a splash of grapefruit. Overall, this was a good restaurant with a chic atmosphere and an army of a wait staff."

I have to say I do prefer when it's one week in the spring and one week in the fall. Even this yelper has trouble with this many expensive and rich meals in a two week period.  But I'm gonna take one for the team and do as many restaurants as I can.  So I started with fix at Bellagio and it's in the main casino .  The thing about this restaurant is , it's very awkwardly set up. There's not a lot of space to move around and the surroundings are very.... small.  I thought initially the service would be good . But when we finally decided on our wine and our restaurant week meal, the server took absolutely for ever to get us our bottle of conundrum .  I have the tuna appetizer and it was excellent. Certainly the best thing about the meal.  Now this appetizer would normally cost $21. Because it was part of the restaurant week three-course meal I only got three pieces but I was quite satisfied with it. It's served on crispy rice and it's very good.  The steak was excellent I always ask for medium rare and they got it right and it was served on a bed of creamy potatoes.  Dessert was a brown butter cake and it was quite good. There was only one choice for dessert on restaurant week menu . If it was something I didn't like that be something to complain about but I really did like the dessert.  All in all a good start to restaurant week but if I were going back when it wasn't restaurant week I would likely think it was a little pricey."

Our server Devin was so patient with our table and he made sure everyone's order came out correctly. \n\nI feel like we ate so much food.. from the wings... sliders... bone in filet... adult mac n cheese... scallops... and about every dessert they had! My favorite are their wings, a little spicey and so amazing!! Every steak I have ever had here has always been cooked to perfection... but the bone in is my favorite!! If you don't order the mac n cheese you are missing out... they fry it like a fishstick and serve it with a truffled cheese dipping sauce! OMG and the warm doughnuts are insane!! \n\nThe vibe of this place is FUN, ENERGETIC, and TRENDY! I just love coming here before heading over to the Bank nightclub right next door! Makes life easy with a larger party! If you want a little more relaxed environment come earlier in the night around 5:00 when there are less people. \n\nAs for price its worth every dime! The apps are not overpowering and thats why they are apps, not meals, and the steaks and sides are nice and oversized! Don't come here with a tight wallet, because you want to be able to fully enjoy the menu! Plus its in the Bellagio....so you know how that goes.. :)\n\nThis place is just one of my favorites, and make sure to make a reservation because this place is always booked :)"

Attractive staff, loud music playing and an open front that faces the casino, right next to the nightclub. It is actually run by The LIGHT Group. They run The Bank Nightclub,Jet Nightclub, Yellowtail Sushi, and a few other night-life spots and restaurants around Las Vegas. It is trendy and LOUD.. with scantily clad female servers and bartenders.. and is normally not the kind of place that I would go for a good meal , but we were there to have a night out on the town so it was perfect. The food was good, the service was good and it really wasn't as expensive as you would expect. I mean.. it was about $80 per person when all was said and done, but that was with 4 cocktails, an appetizer of Lobster Tacos, two entrees and two side items. Not 'everyday' kind of spending.. but i t was quality and I liked it. I had the Kurobuta Porkchop for my dinner, and my friend had the Scallops... good quality on both. \n\nI would go there again for sure.. provided that it was a party-kind-of night.. not for a quiet meal.

The restaurant is very beautiful from the outside and we where looking forward to dining. The restaurant was relatively empty and our hostess seated us on the outside edge next to the casino walkway (So much for enjoying the ambiance). It would have been nice to ask if we minded being seated there when there were so many empty tables inside. \n\nWe ordered an appetizer (the Margarita Flatbread) and it was very bland and lacked seasoning. As we were finishing the appetizer, two servers stopped by our table and proceeded to clear my empty plate. My wife's plate was empty but she still had one piece of flatbread left. We asked to keep her plate but the servers excuse for taking her plate was that our entree's were on their way. Sounded like a legitimate reason so we allowed her to take the plate and leave the last piece of flat bread. Well, our entree's took about another 10-15 minutes to arrive so my wife went ahead and finished without a plate. Bottom line is, if we ask to leave the plate, leave it. \n\nThe entree's arrived and I will say my steak and seasonal vegetables were very good. My wife's sea bass still lacked salt but that took asking two servers to bring salt to the table. Another disappointment was the lack of attention from our server. It would have been nice if my wife was asked if she wanted another cocktail but that never happened. The manager asked how our experience was and he seemed generally concerned. \n\nOverall for $200 for two people, I'd expect a flawless dining experience."

Since it's located right next to The Bank Nightclub, it is the perfect place to start a night out and fill your belly with food to soak up all the champagne and vodka you'll drink later!\n\nI absolutely love everything about the restaurant (but I can't seem to justify that 5th star).  The ambiance is dark and beautiful with all of the wood.  The service is great, but not stuffy.  The signature cocktails are amazing (especially the raspberry sin - which has cotton candy as a garnish! And the cucumber martini, which is super refreshing and perfect for summer). They present their cocktails, wine and beer on an iPad, which is super hip and easy to navigate.\n\nI have not had many of their actual entrees, as we always end up getting the small plates and appetizers.  Last weekend I was in here with about 7 other Ladies for a birthday celebrating and \"Girls Night Out.\"  We weren't disappointed.  We all shared everything, and when I say everything, we had just about 2 of everything on the menu. What can I say - we were hungry! :)  \n\nHere is a brief rundown:\n\nlobster tacos - these are a can't miss - even the presentation is great!\n\nFinger Licking FIX - I dream about these wings.  They are perfectly spicy and are \"lollipop\" style, so they are easy to eat and not messy at all.\n\nYellowtail Sashimi - This wasn't my favorite (after tasting the next dish), but the yellowtail was really fresh and overall it was a decent dish.\n\nBill's Spicy Tuna - SO GOOD.  The ponzu was amazing.  I could've eaten this all night, and I am not really a sushi person.\n\nCalamari - Again, decent.  Nothing to write home about, but good.  It's hard to \"screw\" up calamari, so this was pretty standard.\n\nBobby Baldwin Burgers - Named for the President of the Bellagio. 3 kobe beef sliders with American cheese and onions and served with fries.  They were pretty good, but a little too juicy/messy for me.\n\nTruffle penne - I was really impressed by this pasta dish.  The peas are an awesome addition and it was super filling.\n\nVery Adult Mac N Cheese - Probably one of my favorite things I ate.  So cheesy and fried and delicious.  The dipping sauce took the cheese to another level!\n\nFor dessert, you can't come to FIX and not get the donuts!  They each had a slice of banana inside (which was strange at first) and had both chocolate and peanut dipping sauces on the side.  Pretty much their signature dessert.\n\nApple Cobbler - I am not a big sweets/dessert eater, but this was my favorite out of the bunch.  The cobbler was warm and crumbly with vanilla ice cream on top.\n\nWarm Banana Bread Pudding - I couldn't get past the texture and only had 1, very small bite.  It just wasn't my thing.\n\nOverall the service was great, the atmosphere was fun, and it was the perfect start for a night of clubbing.  If you are in the Bellagio, definitely stop in for dinner and drinks!"

That being said, this place is way overpriced for the value and the wait staff leave a lot to be desired. We have actually had the same waiter twice now and both times he has been less than stellar. Considering the atmosphere and location this is not much of a problem, but with the plates as expensive as they are??? Menu also could stand more updating and larger selection."

            "review": "On our last visit to LV we decided to venture from our usual eateries and try Fix.  I was a little hesitant based off the 3 star yelp reviews but nevertheless  I was excited to try something different we were the first people in line waiting for the restaurant to open.  As I approached the hostess with our reservation some guy with a large party abruptly and rudely cut in front of us and talked over us saying he needed to be seated....him and his party of 40 or so.  Great. He made it seem very urgent as they were going to start trailing in shortly.  One of the other employees must have seen the whole thing happen and waived us over thankfully someone there was attentive.  Our order for party of 2 was not about to get stuck in a queue behind his party of 40 so we quickly ordered right away.  The bruschetta aka crack bread, the lobster tacos, the sliders and the penne pasta was what we ordered all of the items were off the hook.  My only gripe was that the bite sized lobster tacos were so small.  I inhaled the lobster tacos and the bruschetta.  I thought I wouldn't leave satisfied based off the smaller portions but we ordered two items per person and it was more than enough.  Fix was so amazing I cannot wait to go back."

Hey, I don't mind going to the bar...just don't make me wait toooo long....which it wasn't.\n\nWe were seated promptly just after getting a drink at the bar.  The bar is pretty nice by the way.  The restaurant is right off the casino floor, so when you add in the music and all the extra noise it can be a lil loud.  \n\nAnyways, we started with the shell fix appetizer which consisted of lots of shellfish options, like fresh lobster, prawns, crab, clams, oysters.  It was good, but it was also a bit pricey.  I had the drunken lobster as my main and my significant other had a steak (don't ask me which one).  His steak was the best he had ever had, and my lobster kicked a$$!  To end our evening we had the warm banana bread pudding, and let me just tell you I would go back to this restaurant just to have this dessert again...it was that good!!!\n\nTo sum it up, the food was excellent and the ambiance was pretty nice as well.  I am only giving Fix 4 out of 5 stars because we were seated really close to the door to the back where all the food comes out, so it was very busy around us.  Also, the seating was very close, so with out trying we ended up hearing our neighbor's conversation...not my cup of tea!"

We didn't arrive until 6 and we're on a bit of a time crunch at that point but shouldn't have a big deal there were probably 4 other people in the entire restaurant. It was Sunday night. We were told there would be a few minute wait while they cleaned our table...umm okay?? Besides us being late for our reservation...there were about 20 other clean tables? I'm confused. The service was fine..that of which you would receive at say..applebee's or outback..slow..unattentive..the guy was nice but nothing extraordinary for an upscale restaurant. The food was mediocre at best. That's why it's getting 2 stars. My steak had no flavor. I had the 8oz filet and my boyfriend got the organic grass fed new york strip also with no flavor.

The sports game playing on the TV near us felt out of place, though a friend said it's likely someone was betting on the game and wanted to see its outcome.\n\nOur group of six didn't have reservations, but we secured seating by the bar. Service was outstanding! Our servers (Monica and Candy) were attentive and friendly. Monica got us tasty shots - the one I remember was a lemon drop with blueberry. (As you may have read elsewhere, their waitstaff is indeed gorgeous. I freakin' giggled like a middle schooler when Monica flashed a smile in my direction.)\n\nA few of us were recovering from a buffet earlier that day, so we went for side dishes and appetizers:\n- The Bobby Baldwin Burgers ($25) - three kobe sliders (with cheddar, grilled onions, and spiced fries) - were excellent, moist, and flavorful. Wish I had some right now.\n- I'm an oyster junkie, so I had to get their oysters ($3/oyster; East, West, and Speciality oysters available) were fresh and delicious.\n- The Forks ($21) were a little cheesy (in both senses of the word) - smoked salmon, caviar poppers, scallion blinis. My least favorite, but still tasty.\n\nI'd stop in again for the sliders, and perhaps their entrees (my one friend enjoyed his 20 oz. Ribeye ($49), and I trust his opinion). While the food was as pricey as I expected for a casino restaurant, the food TASTED better than I expected, even for the opulent Bellagio. Recommended for a try."

Next we split the Truffle Penne with had prosciutto in it which was delectable! they had already split the portions and brought the servings in two separate dishes. It was so tasty and creamy, that I could have had more but it was just enough to save room for dessert. For the dessert, we listened to the advice of our server and ordered the banana infused donuts that came with sides of chocolate and peanut butter dipping sauces. Even though this sounded a little bizarre, it was actually very good and we ate them up really quick!! cant wait to come back and try other things on their menu that I saw but was unable to try on this trip!, no worries...i go back in a few days!"

The service was friendly and good enough.\n\nFashion Report:\nNot that it should keep you from eating there, but the outfits the girls are required to wear are borderline absurd. The plain black dresses aren't nearly flashy enough to be Vegas-slutty-chic, and aren't made up of enough material to qualify as something that could actually be called clothing. I have to believe their underwear alone would have been less revealing, somehow, and certainly more flattering - bravo to the designer who created a simple, black \"dress\" that all at once shows too much back, chest, stomach, legs, butt crack AND cheeks! Hats off, really! The casino cocktail waitresses at Binions looked more dignified. To the point, just ill-paired for the restaurant's elegant decor."

This wasn't a problem because we all just headed straight to the bar. Our party of seven was seated and we all looked over the menu. Being on a set budget for dinner here, can be difficult. The items are all a little pricey, but that can be expected for dinner in Vegas.\n\nWe weren't that hungry, so we all seemed to get appetizers, side dishes, and drinks. I ordered an Apple Martini that was delicious! One of the best I have had! Our meal took a little while to come out...but that is understandable for a part of unexpected seven. I had the mini crab cake BLTs and mini loaded baked potatoes. Both were delicious...but VERY small portions. Luckily I wasn't that hungry because I would be STARVING. The portions are very small for the prices given. That is why I deducted a few stars.\n\nBut, the atmosphere is very cool! If you are familiar to the restaurant STACK, it has a similar look to that. Pieces of wood are stacked upon each other around the room, making an almost ribbon-like effect. The mood lighting is comfortable and the deep colors of the wood create a soothing effect. It is a really chill place to either have drinks or dinner with friends and family. Just a little pricey for not that much food??"

Don't get me wrong, I have no issue paying for a nice meal that is deserving of $40+ per entree (Quince, Coi, Gary Danko, Michael Minna, Valentino, Spago, Melisse, Daniel, Tru), however, given the rather boring menu and unbalanced flavors of the food, I have no plans to return for another meal.\n\nPerhaps the first warning flag was how easy it was to get a reservation for Sat night given we made the reservation just a few hours before dinner. When we arrived in time for our 9pm reservation, the restaurant was half empty. (Never a good sign especially given it was prime dinner time on a weekend). The space was nicely decorated and wasn't overly stuffy like some other Vegas restaurants. Perhaps this was the only redeeming quality about this place. \n\nWe ordered the tomato soup and fried rock shrimp to start. The soup tasted liked the Trade Joe's Roasted Tomato Soup. It was okay but I expected more from a $16 first course. The grilled cheese sandwich that accompanied the soup was greasy and unappealing. The fried shrimps were oily and bland. We didn't finish either dish and our meal was not off to a good start. To make things worse, we then waited 45 minutes (no joke) for our entrees. There were no bread baskets to nibble on during the wait and our waiter didn't come by once to acknowledge the unusual long wait for our food or to check on our drinks. Finally, when the entrees arrived, we were all hoping the food would redeem this place, but sadly we were overly optimistic. As many Yelpers pointed out, the pasta had way too much truffle oil in it. It is true that too much of a good thing is not always good. I sat across from the friend who ordered the pasta and the smell of the overly truffled and parmesan'd dish made me slightly queasy. The roasted chicken was unbelievably dry and tasteless, and the sliders were worst than the frozen White Castle ones you can buy from the grocery store. \n\nOverall, a poor dining experience, not to mention the $100 we spent per person on dinner. We would have been better off eating at Olives or Yellowtail Sushi, both of which are located in the Bellagio and have better food and atmosphere."

I tried some tuna that my mom got which was really good and the margarita flatbread was certainly better than mine.\n\nService is very professional and impressive. Our waitress was very helpful and kind throughout the meal. There's just no way I would go back with the price tag and average food unless I was staying in The Bellagio and didn't want to venture outside the hotel."

It came off to a rocky start because we arrived promptly at 8:30p.m., however, our table wasn't ready until 9:00p.m. despite our set reservation at 8:30p.m. It didn't help that there wasn't any available seating in the bar area to pass away the time. \n\nOnce we were seated, the service improved to stellar. We had a pre-fix menu that included a tremendous amount of food. We started off with the most juiciest cheeseburger sliders (which were my favorite, btw), mini crepe pancakes served with creme fraiche, smoked salmon with cream cheese inside that were shaped into little pouches and attached to an end of a fork, fresh yellowtail. OH-MY-GOD. Everything was delicious. I chose the butternut squash ravioli, but thought it was a bit too sweet for my dinner palette. Our waiter was so kind enough to get me a different entree to which I chose the seabass and that was unbelievable. It was big hunk of sea bass served with risotto in a light broth. For dessert, we had homemade doughnuts that were served with chocolate and peanut butter sauce---woah!!!\n\nI'm definitely returning to this restaurant the next time I am in town."

The service was perfect through the entire meal. We started off with the Yellow Tail Jalape\u00f1o and the Spicy Tuna. For the main course I had the crispy skin chicken.

Let's go back light years ago, when I worked at Caramel Lounge as a Cocktail Waitress.  \n\nWhen Fix first opened in 2005, I was fortunate to be able to attend the grand opening and got my fix on!  In addition, the Light Group employees had discount rates so I took advantage of the delicious appetizers and meals from FIX kitchen at the end of my shifts. My ultimate favorites are:\n\nKobe Beef Sliders - These little succulent burgers are served on a long rectangular plate and poked with a toothpick to keep everything in place.\n\nYellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno and Ponzu sauce - Yes! The Jalapeno on top of the yellowtail is so addicting that ever since my first bite, I always order my sushi with thin sliced Jalapenos\n\nFingerlicking FIX Buffalo Style Wings - These chicken wings are re-shaped into the bone so that it is perfectly fit for a finger licking FIX! You will understand if you have tried this! \n\nBobby Baldwin Burgers - Named after Mr. Bobby Baldwin himself... This comes with the Kobe Beef Sliders with the spiced fries, grilled onions and aged cheddar. The fries are seasoned just right with an aged cheddar dip, which makes you feel like you are fine dining with Nacho Cheese extravaganza! \n\nCrispy - Rock Shrimp Chili and Calamari Lime are crispy appetizer delight seasoned with a fresh taste of ocean.\n\nDry Aged Rib Eye - This rib eye steak is enormous that Chef Brian Massie himself, was surprised that I could I kill off the steak on my own leaving without a trace, except for the trails of my fork from sweeping up the excess meat juice!\n\nAt my recent visit, I tried the lobster tacos in addition to my favorites. I love the freshness of the grilled mango and another must try is the martini drink called the cucumber essence! Cucumber martini is so delicious and perfect for a hot summer day to cool off from the heat! \n\nFix has great interiors and lounge music playing. I have always enjoyed  the restaurant being open to the casino and it's nice to people watch as they walk back and forth from casino to the Bellagio shops. In addition, Fix staff are friendly and servers are beautiful.  \n\nIf you have the cash to splurge and want to check out a beautiful staff, then put your nice out fit on and get fixed at Fix..."

Our table was nice and pretty private which was great for a large party on a busy night but that was one of the only good things about this place. Everything on the menu sounds great but not much actually delivers. Standout dishes were 2 entrees- the scallops and the seabass. Portions here are small and service is not good. Our apps came out in literally 5 minutes however entrees took more than an hour. By the end of the meal we just wanted to get out of there and so we past on dessert. Portions small and prices too high for what you get, even for Vegas. Bottom line- go somewhere else... not worth the money."

            "review": "Food: Mostly average with a few highlights (lobster tacos, rock shrimp, scallops, mac+cheese, lobster mashed potatoes). I would probably avoid the steaks - all the ones I've tried here were way too salty, with the possible exception of the ribeye (which I only had a bite of). Dover sole was also disappointing - especially at its $62 price point - as it was overcooked.\n\nDrinks: Love the cucumber martini here. Actually most of the martinis are great, even if many are pretty girly. Gum drop and strawberry aviation martinis are really good and come with fun garnishes. There's also a chocolate banana martini that's on the dessert menu but not the regular drink menu (what, are they trying to say there's something wrong with having dessert before dinner??)\n\nService: Very hit or miss. I would strongly recommend sitting at the bar if you have a small party, as the bartenders have always been friendly and efficient. On the other hand, there have been times at the tables when it feels like the waiters/runners/busboys are so overworked that their harried and sometimes overbearing manner really tempers the overall experience. Also, on busy nights, food can be very slow.\n\nOverall, I think 3 stars might be a tad generous. FIX winds up being one of those places where if my friends and I are already at Bellagio and don't have existing dinner plans, then sitting at the bar at FIX for a relatively quick bite will get the job done since we know what's good on the menu. The problem is that I think there are better restaurants for that - even in Bellagio."

I did enjoy my meal here, everything was cooked perfectly--for $42 I had \"drunken\" lobster, spinach, and my most favorite part of the dish was the potato gnocchi which was pillowy and delicious, too bad they only give you 4.  Thank goodness I'm a lightweight eater, I can't imagine too many other people getting full on this meal.  Their ribeye was cooked perfectly but unfortunately the only side it came with was 2 potato chips. huh?  Trendy yes but lame.  Again, paying for ambience so grab a mojito and go with the flow.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Other items on their menu include sliders, fries, poke, other cuts of meat (filet mignon, kobe beef), pasta, party platters, even cheeseburger and tomato soup, so there is a decent selection of food just know the bill comes out to $80 per person average with drinks for a \"casual\" meal in the hip bellagio of vegas."

Perfectly cooked ground kobe topped with onions caramelized just enough & a big slab of melted cheddar. \n\nVery Adult Mac & Cheese:  My preference is without the truffle oil but if you like truffle oil the rest of the dish is delicious. \n\nTomato soup: NOT your Campbell's version. It is a hearty soup that could be a meal in itself. robust yet a creamy texture. Served with a mini grilled cheese. \n\n... and the drinks were never empty. \n\nI looked up my bills & averaged them:  with several cocktails they averaged about $178.00 per trip.

The service was impeccable - waters always filled, extremely friendly servers, quick service, more than happy to accommodate (2 people in our party had a peanut oil allergy, and because all their fried foods are fried in peanut oil, our server went out of his way to not only tell us exactly what on the menu was cooked in peanut oil, but to also check in with our table to make sure we weren't accidentally sharing the items cooked in peanut oil).  \n\nThe food was SO good. We ordered sides of mac & cheese (fried mac & cheese, comes w/ 4 sticks), creamed spinach, & lobster mashed potatoes. Everything was really good, but the mac & cheese and the creamed spinach really stole the show. I ordered scallops and they were amazing. The scallops came out on top of a thick strip of bacon on top of something fried (potato, I think) with hollandaise sauce drizzled on top. Presentation was excellent and the food tasted even better. Even though the portions looked small, it was surprisingly quite filling.  \n\nThe food is pretty rich, so keep that in mind when you're wearing a restricting cocktail dress. May want to bust out the loose, flowy tops for this restaurant. :) I'd dress up a little to match the vibe in the restaurant (but it's a little more relaxed then the other restaurants in the Bellagio). Definitely not too expensive either. Though it's fairly open if you sit \"outside\" closer to the casino, if you get a table inside it definitely feels more removed from the rest of the casino. Cocktails are a little pricey, but at least they're using good liquor. Fix was great & I'd definitely come back."

Seriously.  They blamed OpenTable, whatever.  At the end of the day, if they knew there were problems, how come nobody contacted us? RIDICULOUS.\n\n2) Prices - $44 for a piece of fish or chicken? Really? I've been to top restaurants in LV, NYC, SF, etc, and while I've seen expensive food, it comes along with... amazing service, uber-fresh ingredients, creative menus, etc.  This was just ripoff central.\n\n3) Food quality - my seabass was bland, as in had less flavor than microwaveable fish sticks.  One person in our party sent their food back!  Chicken was dried out, sides were meh.  The \"bright spot\" was the appetizers, which I cannot recall even a few days later, so probably not too bright.\n\n4) Ambiance - eh, it was \"fine\".  Nothing special, no great decor, nothing revolutionary.  \n\n5) Service was decent, they kept glasses full, etc.  Again, not amazing (no synchronized food delivery for example), just average.

I think the concierge at The Venetian actually recommended FIX at the Bellagio Hotel so, off we went in our heels and hoochie outfits. \n\nMother of God.  FIX is ridiculously, fantastically, wonderfully GOOD. Yummmmmmy.  Orgasmic.  I can't even tell you what we eat but, EVERYTHING - and I mean everything - we ordered was fantabulous.  The complimentary bread/breadsticks, the appetizers, the main courses and the desserts.  Especially the motherfreakin' desserts. Oh. Mah. Gawd. Becky.  I think we ordered some sort of salmon or caviar mouse appetizer that was served in teeny appetizer spoons but, I swear, being ripped off for single-bite appetizers never tasted so dang good.  Each of us ordered a different dessert so I think, between the five of us, we tried every single dessert on the menu.  My friends have photographic evidence of me actually picking up one of the plates and licking it clean.  Sad, huh?  Another place I would never go for a first date because I'd scare my date off.  \n\nIn terms of ambiance, FIX has lowered walls, which means one section of the restaurant is in open/full view to the public.  FIX is also immediately adjacent to one section of the main casino floor.  Since there are lowered walls, it's an excellent place to people watch on the casino floor.  Of course, this also means that passers-by can watch the \"human zoo show\" as you turn into the food monster and inhale the twelve dishes you can't help but order and devour.  But FIX is also loud, crowded and full of well-dressed clientele - so maybe you won't get noticed as you destroy your second dessert,...\n\nFive stars for FIX.  Too bad you can't dress down and wear sweats - I could have eaten more if I had some room to work with.  \n\n[Side note: The event/party promoter for \"Light\" at Bellagio stopped by our table to hook us up with free admission into the club.

Ribeye was very good although I still think it wasn't amazing. Good cocktail - Cucumber Martini. Good casual dinner - not a fan of the lighting but good times with some coworkers."

            "review": "FIX is the first restaurant run by The Light Group, which previously had created several trendy lounges and clubs (e.g., Light, Caramel, Mist). FIX was their chance to create a trendy restaurant. It was a success, and they've since followed up with STACK, a similar type of restaurant at The Mirage.\n\nThe menu concentrates on trendy or inventive variations of standard American fare. Lobster tacos, yellowtail sashimi, and Kobe sliders share the menu with scallops Benedict, steak and for dessert, banana filled doughnuts. Trendy drinks are also available. Care for a habanero mango margarita?\n\nThe bartenders and servers certainly have that trendy look: young, thin, dressed in tight black skin-and-tatoo revealing clothing. Service is friendly and efficient. On Halloween, the look varied a little: lots of black, white, and the occasional red undergarment not so discreetly displayed.\n\nLocated just off the casino floor, the room is loosely divided into three areas: bar, lounge, and dining room. The same menu is available everywhere. It can get pretty noisy, but somehow it's not objectionable - just fun.\n\n**Meal #1:\n* I started with a crab cake made of shredded (not lump) crab meat, but with very little filler. It was baked, and served on a pool of remoulade sauce. Rating: good.\n* For my entree, I had Scallops Benedict: three large sea scallops, barely cooked through, on top of applewood smoked bacon ,a thick layer of spinach, and shredded potato cake. It was a good combination of flavors, executed well; very good.\n* For dessert, Shake and Cake: espresso milk shake and a brownie. The milk shake was in an espresso cup, with icy froth, and a strong coffee/chocolate shake; very good. The brownie was soft, chewy, nutty, intensely chocolatey. Wow! I want another.\nThe bill (including one drink): $80.\n\n\n**Meal #2:\n* I started with their daily special: toro tartare. This consisted of several thin slices of tuna that tasted more like maguro (regular tuna) than toro (tuna belly). Nonetheless, good.\n* For my entree, I had Drunken Lobster with Prosciutto Gnocchi: a lobster tail, medium size, split and resting on what was presumably an alcohol based sauce. That doesn't sound so great, but it was very good.\nThe bill: too much. With one martini (gin of course; none of those newfangled vodka martinis for me), it came to a little over $90.\n\n\n\nFIX is loud and trendy, and serves trendy food - just the kind of place I'm likely to hate. However, the atmosphere is more fun than anything else, and the food is surprisingly good. If you can put up with the prices, it's a worthwhile destination."

Buttery, melt in your mouth and seared to perfection, served atop risotto in a lobster broth. This would definitely be on my \"last meals\" list. The truffle penne pasta with peas is good and one to make at home. The lobster tacos are also very delish and have a good amount of fresh lobster meat. The filet is good like you would expect any filet served on the strip. Even if you think you don't have room, order their donuts for dessert anyways. They're served warm with 2 dipping sauces...yum.\nDon't expect to have much conversation as it's pretty loud. Service is usually good and signature drinks though pricey are very good.\nIt's been awhile so I think it's time for another Fix :)"

At Stack I found the service at the table to be pretty good, and the food was pretty good. What I hated about the place was the attitude of the hostess and the women behind the bar. Well, that and the fact that the place was ridiculously overpriced.\n\nAnd you know what? Fix is just like Stack! The hostess had the same crappy attitude, and just like at Stack we were seated at probably the worst table in the restaurant. Yes, that's right, the restaurant stereotype lives - parties with children or women dining without men get stuffed in the back corner tables. But the worst attitudes are the women behind the bar. These girls have a heightened sense of self-importance the likes of which I have never seen (just like at Stack). These women are walking sterotypes.\n\nThe table service was attentive and good. The food wasn't bad - I had a New York strip, daughter had Kobe sliders with fries, wife had filet with shrimp. Wife and I each had a cocktail. $25 for two cocktails? Really? I mean, really? Tanqueray & tonic is $11? Really? What a rip-off.\n\nThe bill for three of us (only one cocktail for each adult) and no dessert was over $200. I feel like I have been completely ripped off, and I'd rather have that feeling at the craps table.\n\nAs an aside, this place could gain an extra star if it would do two things: 1) enforce the dress code; 2) dump the women behind the bar"

We were seated immediately, and had a good view of all the people walking by in the casino.\n\nI chose the margarita pizza and the adult's mac and cheese. The pizza had the usual ingredients, but it was a little more \"flat bread\" style, served in a rectangle shape. I was afraid that I'd look like a heffer if I ordered a whole pizza just for myself, but luckily the size of the pizza was perfect! I naturally inhaled it anyways, but at least it didn't look like I just dominated a huge Domino's sized pizza (this is what I convinced myself anyways). Pizza was very good, and tasted very fresh. There were even little juicy warm tomatoes on top, which added to the freshness.\n\nThe mac and cheese was definitely different that I expected....perhaps because no where in the description did it mention it was fried and served in fried sticks with a side of truffle oil. Even though it wasn't what I expected, it was still very good! My favorite part was the inside of the fried sticks which contained the mac and cheese. I kind of wished that the mac and cheese was just served regularly and not fried though because it was VERY rich and I actually didn't finish it all. I think the mac and cheese on its own was good enough to not need the fried outer coating.\n\nI was very intrigued by the dessert menu, but was way too full after the rich food. If I had room though, it was a tie between the mocha milkshake with chocolate brownie and the donuts...they both looked delicious."

If you are not looking to spend hundres of dollars on a meal go somewhere else. \n\nI went here on a date (on New Years Eve) before heading to The Bank for a show.  It was the only place to get a reservation for dinner near our show location.  When we arrived the staff was GREAT and let us sit at the bar.  They even let us use the reserved seats until our table was ready.  They have a GREAT selection of liquor too, my man in a big scotch fan so he was VERY excited to see they had a great selection. The drinks we got before being seated should have been our first clue to the bill...it was $40 for 2x drinks!\n\nOnce we were seated they brought out the menu...it is a mandatory four course meal! Which is AWESOME if you are hungry! Each person pays a flat rate and they get an appetizer, salad, main course, side dish and dessert platter.  We did NOT look up the price before coming here but figured it'd be a few hundred bucks.  We were NOT prepared for the $165 flat rate price of dinner per person, when the waiter told us I was a little shocked.  Ot was $40 and $60 upgrades for the specials too. My date got the lobster which was a $40 upgrade and worth it. It was AMAZING! However, after we already ordered and ate the appetizers/salads the waiter told us that the lobster was in addition to the main course so we could get something else if we wanted.  Since we were going to a show we didn't get any other food, but I was not very happy about this! There was so much food in the 4 courses we could have got one meal w/ a lobster on top and split everything. Oh well, the dinners were really good. I got the filet mignon w/ adult mac-and-cheese. It was AMAZING! The best steak I have ever had, and the mac-an-cheese was at the suggestion of the waiter...good choice. I had the kobe sliders for an appetizer too...they were delicious! My date had the lobster and the asparagus, both were wonderful! The dessert was a mixture of chocolate covered strawberry's and candies...all good. We also got a bottle of wine, a suggestion of the waiter (reasonably priced at about $55 bucks a bottle) it was really good. \n\nThe food here was AMAZING! It was probably one of the best meals I have ever had, it was trendy American food with a twist.  The service was also the best I have ever had, the waiters were engaging and friendly with out being over bearing.  My ONLY complaint was the price. We spent $600 on dinner for two people. Yes, we should have looked more into the price before going but the food was not worth that much money. Definitely great for a once in a life-time meal though!"

We had the deep fried deviled eggs. AMAZING was my favorite appetizer until. We tore into the Kobe deconstructed chili cheese fries. STUNNING!  \n\nFor my main I had the 20oz bone in ribeye. I am typically a filet guy but went off the map a little since it was my first time there. Trying a filet would not have been fair as I have my favorite places for filets.

I ate the edges and got as far into the meat of the steak that I could and let the rest lay. The flavor or the ribeye great. I just wish I could've enjoyed it for all 20oz. My only regret is that we. Didn't get desserts. \n\nWell I did have a third Manhattan. I got a good 'Fix' and would do it again.\n\nIf my steak would've been perfect. So would their score."

Much better ambiance than Le Cirque for diners under 60.\n\nGreat service from our cocktail server! The kale caesar and truffle penne pasta were both delicious! The portions are substantial for the value and we ended up taking the donuts home. \n\nMust get cocktails: Raspberry Sin* & Cucumber Martini!! Soooo good!\n\n*eat a pinch of cotton candy before the cocktail dissolves all of it :)\n\nWhen we're back at the Bellagio, we won't dine anywhere else. Highly recommend!"

            "review": "As someone said before, it's hard to complain about an expensive restaurant in the Bellagio. But there's more negatives than just the price.\n\nWe'll start with the positives.  It's a trendy place, modern decor and all of the waitresses are dressed in little black dresses.  Monica was my server and she was incredibly friendly and helpful.  Also, as most Vegas restaurants don't allow casual attire, I got there early and was allowed to eat in shorts and a t-shirt.  I had intended to go home and change before eating, but my hunger got the best of me.\n\nNow on to the negatives.  This place is WAY over priced and basically surviving, IMO, based on the fact that it's in the Bellagio.  Any other hotel other than Caesar's or the Wynn and this place couldn't get away with charging what they do.  The food is subpar.  My $50 steak was dry, overcooked and had little to no flavor.  As an appetizer my Mom and I shared the macaroni and cheese sticks or whatever it is that they call them. They were disgusting.  I forced two down my throat only because of the price of them.  My mom had the pork chops and I don't think she even ate half of her meal.  She also complained that it was dry.  I had a shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and that was mediocre at best.\n\nI'm not one to complain about pricing, I'll eat at Prime anytime anyone wants to go, but if you're going to charge prices higher than Nine and other top end Vegas restaurants, at least have the food to back it up.  Neither my mom nor I had any alcohol with our meal, we each had an entree, an appetizer and shared a side.  Our bill with tip was $250.\n\nSave your money and go elsewhere!"

Our part did not want to spend another hour waiting for a desert. They took off our drink off our bill which was nice, but to be completely honest should of taken off something a little more expensive, especially for the fact our food was at room temperature by the time we actually got to eat."

The heavenly combination of scallops and crab sauce over tiny potato pancakes was perfection. Very rich but clean and fresh tasting.\n\nMy dinner companion had a lovely veal chop and lobster mashed potatoes. She loved her dinner and said it was very filling.\nShe sampled a few wines before settling on a Jordan Cabernet. She loved that, too.\n\nWe shared the banana doughnuts with insipid dipping sauce. This was a rancid tasting, stomach clenching mistake. \nEven though much of it was left, no one really seemed to care.\nThis wasn't the worst part of the evening...\n\nAfter we were seated, a couple sat down at the next table. They had clearly been fighting for a while and the food and wine didn't help things. It was beyond awkward. At one point, the man placed himself between our two tables and continued the argument that was both personal and pornographic. It was awful and didn't let up until he got up and left.\n\nIt was very disturbing. I have a bit of claustrophobia and as I had no clear path out and my breathing space impaired, I started to feel lightheaded.\n\nThe manager should have been sensitive to the situation and either moved them or us. All I could think of was how to breathe with all of this going on. The throbbing and ultra loud music didn't help matters.\n\nWe thought this would be the finest meal at the Bellagio but it was a terrible experience."

The wood ceiling design is very cool. \n\nService - very good\n\nFood - 2 8 oz filets ($48 ea) cooked perfectly but have a heavy smoke flavor of mesquite. Not the flavor profile I look for in a $48 piece if meat. Let it speak for itself....it will with flavor, juiciness etc. It's not a BBQ restaurant and mine don't taste that smokey. This was VERY disappointing for us. We've been to Ruth's Chris, Flemings, Morton's, Maestros etc. Steak like this is not supposed to have a smoke flavor this heavy. \nTruffle pasta was great with prosciutto  and peas but was $37. Very pricey for this dish. Even $27 would have been too much. \nSides - smoked mashed potatoes were to whipped for my liking and were served in small taurine ($12). Mac and cheese ($15)bites were good. Basically like 4 fish sticks only better. They were good, but not great. Creamed corn with a touch of jalape\u00f1o was the best. It was very good but again in a small taurine. We wanted more for $12! No bread offered to the table either. Bummer. \n\nDrinks - pineapple mojito ($20)!!\nJack Daniels and 7 UP ($14) each\nRobert Hall Syrah was great for $52.00. \n\nOver all - nice place inside Bellagio but just a tad pricey with small portions.\n\nBottom Line - I'm out and wont be returning to FIX. There are much better places that have better food with better prices including appetizers."

Still, the menu boasts some unique tastefully done dishes and some delicious cocktails. The service was friendly and the price was okay, not the best for the food you get.

The bar was half full and there were 2 bar tenders working 1 female and 1 male. It was clear to see the male bartender was taking care of the servers and the guests at his end of the bar. We waited patiently for the bar tender to greet us or even ask us what we wanted to drink. 10 minutes go by nothing not even a glance at us or eye contact. We both took turns going to the ladies room and now 20 minutes go by still nothing. The bar is not packed by all means and there are at least 3-4 empty seats. Im beginning to wonder if we were invisible , if she was just plain tunnel visioned, if she was in training, or if she was prejudging us because we were not white.  The rest of our party is now arriving and still no drink. Being a bartender and beverage server in las vegas myself i start to get upset at this horrible service.  30 minutes now and just as i decide i had enough of being treated like were invisible. Our table is ready and we get seated. The dinner was average, and the waitress and bussers were very attentive. I am very big on service and come from over 15 years in the customer service industry. So the bar staff gets an overall F! The wait staff an A and its because of them i didnt rate this place with a 1 star. The hosts a B. My overall experience of my first visit to fix after hearing such great things was to say the very least is im not impressed."

Presentation was adorable. Taste was a bit average for restaurant style burgers. I got to taste the lobster tacos and kobe chili cheese fries. These were the stars that night and I probably could've gotten full off these apps alone. Lobster tacos were interesting, I wasn't expecting to taste anything cold, and the thin shell made it easy to bite into. The chili cheese fries were BOMB!! Presentation again was cute, a stack of fries, hot bowl of cooked chili, and mini pitcher of cheese sauce. I def would recommend this to start off with, but it might outshine your entree. I tried some of the meaty entrees like rib eye (med rare), thought it was too bloody for my taste. Tasted ok, but I'm not really a steak kind of girl. \n\nService was friendly, woman's bathroom was clean (there was a male worker waiting right outside the doors...made me feel a little uneasy), decor was fancy.

However , since I was driving all day and haven't eaten a thing, i asked the waitress if there was some bread or anything to get my blood sugar up. She directed me to ordering an appetizer lol. \n\nThe food : the lobster tacos came in 4 tacos , each was about the length of 2.5 quarters long. That is pushing the miniature trend a bit, don't you think ? And on top of that it was about 25 bucks. It was a pretty bad deal for mediocre food. I dont understand why people rave about it. It wasn't freshly prepared as well. It seemed like it has been sitting in a refrigerator in some tub and they just scooped it in the taco shell. \n\nThe sliders wernt bad , but again I dont understand why people are raving about it. It was your average sliders, perhaps with better grade meat. 30 dollars ish. \n\nPrice: i have to say that their price point and the food that i experienced has a huge disconnect. The food is pretty average and standard but they are charging a premium. I get it if you have a view of the bellagio fountains , or if their food was spectacular , but neither is true. I happily shelled out $$$$ at prime , yellowtail , and olives because of the view but maybe im missing something at fix. \n\nOverall: I think for the aggressive price point and the caliber of food you're getting , there's better options in bellagio and certainly better ones in other casinos."

The service was awesome and the food was great.\n\nFood: This place is known as a steak house with an emphasis for late night dining. Since I don't eat steak, I had the lobster entree with a side of creme spinach. The lobster was very good and included a small portion of vegetables. The spinach was excellent. Creamy, not too salty, and fresh. The lobster was very juicy and delicious. I loved it even though I am normally not a huge seafood girl. For an upscale bar restaurant, the portions were pretty good. \n\nAmbiance: It's very nice and even though there was music playing the entire time, I could hear myself while I was talking. It had a classy modern look with black trimmings. It was a bit dim and attractive yet subtle enough to fit into the theme of the casino. My friend and I had walked passed it without seeing it the first time around.\n\nLocation: Since it's right next to the Bank (lounge/club) at the Bellagio, I will agree with others that you can def. people watch. There will be barely clad women and well dressed men walking pass the restaurant or pre-partying and eating there before moving on next door. Since we went there for a very late dinner (around midnight), the club next door (the bank) also had a couple promoters standing near the restaurant handing out the VIP/free admission tickets for ladies. \n\nService: The service was truly 5 stars here. Both of the guys that served our table were totally genuine, downright awesome, and 1 was originally from the Bay Area (irrelevant but yay!). They were very attentive and checked on us multiple times. When I wanted to use the bathroom, one of them even showed me where it was and walked me to it. \n\nBathroom: Very clean bathroom! Single stall - 1 female, 1 male though technically it can just be 2 unisex bathrooms. There's a lady that attends to the bathroom (both male and female) and she goes in and wipes/cleans the bathrooms quite frequently. \n\nPayment: Takes credit card and you can charge it to your room like most places in Vegas if you happen to be staying at Bellagio or one of the other properties owned by the MGM Mirage group.\n\nIt opens late night and serves dinner until 1am. They never rushed us and provided great service. We sat around chatting for awhile and was never asked to leave.\n\nGreat center strip location and service."

Your table gets assigned a group of servers and they all coordinate to provide good service. However, their food was just amazing. Their speciality is steak. I ordered the kobe steak and it was delicious. The steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and full of flavor. This dish comes with mashed potatoes which were also pretty good. I wished there was more potato as the dish needed a larger side. For our appetizer we ordered some tuna which was fresh and delicious. Both items were very good but also small. This is definitely a great restaurant if you are craving a good quality steak."

Our same group of 4 was really looking forward to another amazing experience....I'm pretty sure I ruined that.  \n\nI'm a vegetarian of over 20 years.  Menus and restaurant choices have come a long way since then, which allows me to find something to eat other than a salad when I go out.  Back to Fix.  We all ordered the same items....Kobe burgers, tomato soup, and adult mac and cheese sticks.  Here's where things went bad.....\n\nI get through half of a mac and cheese stick and feel something funny in my mouth.  Something not mac-y and not cheese-y.  I pull it out of my mouth and see - gasp - MEAT!  WHAT!?!??!!  Fiance confirmed.  It's MEAT.  \n\nWhen the waitress came over, I asked her if there was bacon in the mac and cheese sticks.  She says \"No, it's prosciutto, why?  You don't eat pork?\"  I told her NO, I'm a VEGETARIAN, and the menu did not list pork as an ingredient and you did not tell me when I ordered that pork is an ingredient.  I had to pull out the piece of pork from my MOUTH before I realized it was an ingredient.  She replies with an \"I know, they really should list it on the menu.\"  And she walks away.  \n\nHello!??!?!?!  I was polite about it but firmly expressed that I was not happy.  No offer to get my something else, no offer to comp them, nothing.  I would have at least liked some effin' donuts.  Geez.\n\nI just couldn't believe the any upscale restaurant in this day and age would have the audacity to not list an ingredient like MEAT.  It's so frustrating. \n\nOkay, I'm climbing off the soapbox now.  Good night."

We started with kobe cheese fries (a build it yourself situation, but yummy).  My friends shared a white fish they loved.  My husband had the filet mignon.  It had a great flavor but was very dry (ordered medium rare) and a little tough.  I had dover sole and this is why my review is rated downward.  I love dover sole and don't get it very often.  At $62 a serving you would think it would be amazing.  Yet, it came out overcook, oversalted, and undersized.  A disappointment all around.

Sadly, the food and drinks are mediocre and insanely overpriced, and the menu descriptions are ridiculously inaccurate. Take your money and go over to The Cosmo restaurants where you at least get what you pay for. \n\nFirst, I ordered the red sangria which tasted like it had a foot marinating in it. I don't know what red wine they used, but it was nasty. I sent it back and ordered a champagne cocktail which was just ok, and certainly not worth the $20 price tag. I'm not sure I've ever paid that much for a drink, even in the SF Bay Area where I live. \n\nSecond, we ordered the fried mozzarella -- I'm expecting something along the lines of fancy fried cheese sticks, but what came out was a big ball of mozzarella wrapped in phyllo dough sitting in tomato sauce. That was fine, but the strange thing was there was no bread/crostini/etc to put the cheese on. Do they expect people to shovel hunks of straight up melted mozzarella into their mouths? It was just weird. I asked for bread so we had something to put the cheese on, and they delivered dinner rolls. Again, weird, but I suppose it's better than eating straight melted cheese by itself. \n\nThird, we ordered the adult Mac and cheese. Nowhere does the description on the menu say it's fried, and out comes fried macaroni and cheese \"sticks.\" They were ok (and honestly reminded me of something off a kids menu, which is ironic given their name), but I wasn't intending to order two fried dishes which was annoying. I'm also wondering who the heck wrote the menu and why they don't just give accurate descriptions of the food they're serving. \n\nFinally, we have the Kobe chili cheese fries. We get a stack of something that's supposed to be fries and a little pot of chili. It was boring. We were sad. At this point we gave up and stopped ordering.\n\nI regret that I spent $112 after tip for a meal that was not any better than one I could have gotten at TGI Friday's."

Called ahead and made reservations but still had to wait 15 minutes. The atmosphere is more like a lounge rather than a restaurant and it can get pretty loud in there. Personally, I loved the music they were playing. There are crowds of all ages. \n\nThe food is delicious. However, you are definitely paying a good amount for each plate. The portions are rather small but of quality. The lobster tacos are an absolute must. The Kobe beef chili cheese fries is great (does not taste or look like your average chili cheese fries). The scallop appetizer dish is very fresh. This plate includes the greatest bacon I have ever tried! \n\nI can see myself returning here. \n\nP.S. They have freshly baked banana filled donuts covered in sugar with two different dipping sauces (peanut butter & chocolate hazelnut) that's out of this world!"

If you hit up Kristen of the Light Group she can hook you and your Bachelorette crew up with an awesome special.  $55/pp will get you a tons of yummy apps like salmon/cavier served on a spoon, Kobe sliders with fries/ Jalapeno Yellowtail Sashimi, a refreshing salad and more then you get a choice of an entree.  Our optiions were Roasted Chicken with crispy skit, Sea Bass and I ordered the Pumpkin Raviolis in a sage and butter sauce.

We had a big group of over 30 people, they arranged to have us sit in round tables joined together, some had 4 people, others had 5 or 6 people.  While the food was sub-par at best, the service was the worst I have ever experienced.   It started during appetizer when each plate had 4 pieces of flat bread.  The servers didn't bother to make sure that tables with 5 or 6 people had enough for everyone, so I had to flag them down to ask.  When the main course was served, the steak came before the steak sauce, and some tables were missing steak sauce.  As the host, I was expecting the waiters and waitresses to take care of making sure my guests were well taken care of.  Instead, I had to run from table to table to make sure everyone had enough sauce. Needless to say, this wasn't the only problem.  The side dishes (mashed potatoes and cream spinach) were so small I manage to get 1 teaspoon of it, and there was hardly enough for my table of 4.  I had to complain, and the waitress brought out 1 extra side for my entire party.  The same thing happened at dessert.  Some tables got their \"doughnut\" desserts, other's did not.  I had to run around again, bringing extra desserts from one table to another.   After complaining to the waitress that I want to speak to the manager, it took an employee of mine to finally get the Assistant General Manager to come over to talk to me.  \n\nIn any decent restaurant, my experience would have resulted in a discount, a reduction in service fees, or at least some sort of compensation to make up for the bad service, but all I heard from him was he was \"sorry\".  \n\nI will never host another group event at any of the MGM properties or restaurant again because of this bad experiences.  FIX needs some serious fixing.  The manager should be fired for the inability to supervise, and the servers need much more training. The food is over priced, and for the $600+ in gratuities they charged me (compulsory for large groups), I was expecting far better service than this.\n\nThe atmosphere was horrible.  You can smell cigarette smoke coming in from the casino, and the sound was so LOUD I couldn't hear anything the person sitting across from me was saying without them having to shout.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT FOR LARGE GROUPS!"

We were a few minutes late to our reservation and they still seated us immediately and were incredibly nice about the whole thing. As soon as we sat down the hostess was so nice and made some small talk and jokes with us which we appreciated, we love people with a good sense of humor. Then our waiter approached us with an incredibly friendly smile. His name was Devon and he told us right off the bat that it would be him and 2 other guys serving us tonight. So we had some questions about drinks and I had seen on yelp to get the raspberry sin and he was honest with me that it was a really sweet drink, but I still wanted to try it. So he brings out the martini glass that has a heap of cotton candy in it and waited so I could record the whole process of him pouring the drink in to make the concoction, so nice of him to do that. For our appetizer we ordered the lobster tacos and calamari. Both were simply amazing. We mainly had Devon asking how everything was going and explaining our meals but there was one other guy helping us who was also so helpful and nice. For the main dish I ordered the filet mignon and my boyfriend ordered the pork chop wrapped in bacon. Absolutely phenomenal. Everything was cooked perfectly. So we joked and talked with our waiters some more and they made the whole experience very comfortable and enjoyable. For dessert we ordered the donuts and they ended up being Apple donuts with 2 different sauces. Best desert ever. I highly recommend the donuts! We even asked them where a good oyster bar was and they gave us a ton of really great recommendations. Overall, we had an amazing Valentine's Day dinner because of the amazing service at Fix and the food, of course."

I made reservations ahead on OpenTable, but it wasn't necessary since the restaurant wasn't too crowded when we arrived on Monday night. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated and greeted by Tom. He was very insightful and knew the menu like the back of his hand. He recommended to us his favorite items, which is always appreciated. We started off with the Adult Mac and Cheese, which to my surprise, doesn't come as a typical Mac n Cheese dish. They dish was fried like chicken fingers and there was a cheese sauce that accompanied it. It was a bit heavy being fried and dipped in cheese, but that's what I was expecting. For our entree, we ordered the SeaBass Risotto w/ lobster broth and Scallops benedict with potato cake. Let me just say, WOW. Both dishes were superb. The risotto was soft, creamy, and savory. The seabass was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin on top. The fish wasn't overcooked or chewy and was very fragile. The scallops was cooked nicely with a crisp on one side. It wasn't bitter, but flavorful with soft scallop meat. It was drizzled with crab hollandaise sauce. It didn't taste like breakfast, but a hearty dinner. To finish off the night, we were given complimentary champagne while eating Tiramisu Trifle. The trifle wasn't too sweet and had just the right amount of cream and lady fingers. The cup was big like a Sunday, but manageable. Throughout the whole night, there were three waiters who consistently check on us to ask how the dinner was. The bill came out to be around $150, which is pricey but is warranted by the location in the Bellagio and great service. This place is truly a gem and is underrated since there are so many other restaurants here."

The place was packed and the menu looked promising, so I was looking forward to our meal.\nThe best thing about the first two courses of dinner was the wine I ordered.  The mixed green salad was rumored to come with candied nuts and pears.  Two flaccid nuts and a one inch stack of matchstick pear slices did not lend much flavor to the dish.  $16?  For a pile of mediocre spring mix?  The pizza was pretty good, but small and not substantial for the price, and my lovely dining companion really enjoyed her salad (the BLT wedge).\nThe service was okay - it seems that 10 tables of mostly two tops for two waitresses is overwhelming though as we were fairly forgotten off in our corner, oh, you know, directly next to the computer where they spent most of their time.  \nHad we not ordered dessert this place would've gotten two incredibly overpriced stars from me.  \nLucky for them the banana bread pudding was quite possibly the most delicious pile of soggy bread I've ever had."

To conduct such service in an environment, where everyone is either drunk or not from there ... is impressive. I wouldn't recommend this place for big groups. When my friend had made the reservation for us, and they said the limit was 5 -- that seemed to make sense. The environment is intimate, cozy and there is a lot of noise.\n\nThe place itself is nice, I love the decor... it's warm woods, make it sexy and the way that it opens up into the hotel is nice. It doesn't close you off from the hustle and bustle that is the Bellagio... and ultimately, that is Vegas.\n\nWhere I run into trouble is the actual menu itself. It's kind of boring. The food, I feel is art here. But more like paint running down a wall. I was uninspired and slightly sober... so I still hold true to that. And that is the point of Vegas, if you eat more than you drink... something is to be said. So ultimately, you don't get your fix.\n\nThere was a wide array at the table. Lobster tacos were $22, and came into very small finger size tacos served on a metal rack. Pizza was tapas size which ran $18. Kobe Sliders with Fries runs $25. Filet runs $50 with no sides. For myself, I ordered like an anorexic -- because I had just swallowed a buffet earlier in the day. I did the Fried Mac n' Cheese which was delectable and the Cucumber Essence martini was great. Total of that $24. And in true Vegas fashion, somehow $60 escaped me at this place.\n\nAll in all, I might come back. If I can let go of my inner fat girl and not surrender to my natural gluttony. Because, when I sit down to eat... I don't expect to feel helpless looking at the food coming out... I expect to feel slightly satisfied."

I am not a seafood eater so I found eating sides and starters would be the way to go. Flatbread, his sister and mom split it....$15 and there were 4 small squares let's say 2\"x 2\". I'm not kidding. I had very adult mac & cheese (per what the menu read) which had prosciutto, mac and cheese breaded and deep fried (think mozzarella stick), and served with a 3 cheese sauce w/ truffle oil. It was delicious, but not for $12/$14 whatever it was. I got 5 sticks I think. THAT was my dinner.

After reviewing our options, we decided on Fix since the place was largely empty at 9:45pm on at Tuesday night and getting a seat at the bar was not a problem.  Just off of the gaming floor, Fix is a chic, modern-looking restaurant/bar with a distinctive wavy wood interior serving upscale American comfort food.\n\nThe cocktail list was, sadly, a clich\u00e9 martini list (really, it is the 21st Century) lacking any drinks utilizing brown spirits.  I started off with the Cucumber Martini ($20) made with Square One Cucumber Vodka, white cranberry juice, and garnished with fresh cucumber and cherry tomatoes.  The drink was nicely balanced with pleasant cucumber aromatics.  It was very pricey (tied with the Bellagio's Lily Bar for the most expensive drinks that I've ever had in Vegas) and, while reasonably enjoyable, not a good value.  \n\nThe gf and I split orders of Kobe Chili Cheese Fries ($17), Very Adult Mac & Cheese ($12), and Beef Carpaccio ($21).  The beef carpaccio was a traditional preparation and presentation.  It was well executed and nicely accented by the drizzling of truffle vinaigrette over the thinly sliced beef.  The chili cheese fries and mac & cheese were far less traditional in preparation and presentation, but no less successful or enjoyable.  The chili cheese fries were a deconstructed/\"build your own\" representation of the classic comfort food staple.  The kobe chili was mildly spicy with a hint of sweetness, and delicious.  The fries were hot, steamy, and crispy.  The cheddar cheese sauce was far from Velveeta.  DC's renowned/way overrated Ben's Chili Bowl could learn a thing or twenty from Fix about chili cheese fries.  The Very Adult Mac & Cheese was presented as three flavorful bars of perfectly deep-fried, four-cheese mac & cheese infused with prosciutto and drizzled with truffle oil.  While it may have been a \"very adult\" mac & cheese, there was nothing my inner child didn't enjoy about the dish.  \n\nFix may not be the best or most acclaimed restaurant on the Strip, but it does what it does, pretty well.  The food, while not inexpensive, is a much better value than the drinks.  Call it 4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the cocktails."
