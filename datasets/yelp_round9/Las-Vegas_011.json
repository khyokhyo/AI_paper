Sleezy Vegas but perhaps the BEST Breakfast on the strip. \nOpen 24 Hours, The Food Good, The Environment Is lots of Laughs and Drunks. All in All This Is a True Liddo Vegas Gem."

            "review": "The Peppermill is a Vegas tradition! Complete with rainbow neon and mirrored ceilings. I think everyone should dine here at least once, because it is an experience within itself. I mean, one time, I sat in a booth right next to Jerry Seinfeld and George Wallace. I'm tellin' you - this place is a Vegas landmark.\n\nTheir menu is a pretty classic diner menu. Think of a little higher-scaled (but not TOO high) than Denny's, with hamburgers, soup, salad, steak, ice cream for dessert and everything in between. All HUGE portions. Including the drink menu... I recommend trying/gawking at their drink called the \"Scorpion.\" Overall, decent prices for decent food.\n\nUnfortunately, service can vary... It depends on when you decide to stop in. Some nights, I've been seated and served with a smile almost immediately. Other nights, I was left hanging for a while in an otherwise quiet restaurant. Regardless, push past that aspect and enjoy yourself. The Peppermill is open 24/7 and is a great place to end up."

Service in the lounge was practically non-existent from what I could tell.\n\nThe menu is very extensive and has some nice breakfast creations on it.   They warn you about the portion size and how an omelet is made with like 10 eggs or something.\n\nI got a \"garbage-can special\" type of dish that had eggs, sausage, ground beef, spinach, onions, hash-browns and a cheese sauce.  It came out in a bowl and while not looking very large, teased me into only finishing half of it.    My wife had French Toast Ambrosia (with fruit and stuff) which she loved.\n\nService was very slow.  Requests for things such as tabasco were forgotten (luckily the table next to us had some which they shared).\n\nI'm sure it's a great hangover joint - just try to catch them during off-hours."

Check.\n\"Interesting\" decor that makes you feel walked through a wormhole into a 70s stripclub? Check.\nAmerican-sized portions? America, Fuck Yeah -- CHECK.\nIndoor firepit? Check.\n\nAs Damon H mentions, the food is \"surprisingly very good.\"  The neon lighting may throw you off, but this place serves some solid grub.  It's on the North end of the strip (e.g. Wynn), so if you're staying in that area it's worth stopping by.  If you're on the South end (e.g. Mandalay Bay), it probably isn't worth enduring the shitty Strip traffic or taxi bill to get here... and if you are staying at one of the examples I listed, you're probably better off impressing your date with room service and possibly another round of drinks back at the room.\n\nThe wait here can be a little lengthy though, but I don't think its as bad as Hash House... and if you are intent on getting here, it's probably best to take Koval Ln or Paradise Rd up to avoid the clusterfuck ;)"

Went and had mimosas inside their fireside bar while we waited 30 min for a table.  This place is always busy but totally vegas from the decor to the staff.  The portions are huge and the one lets are all fluffy and cooked to perfection.  They were out of egg whites unfortunately but the breakfast was pretty much can't miss.  Have never had a terrible experience, and would recommend to anyone that is coming to Vegas!"

Otherwise, you may be doomed to a 20-30 minute wait, if not more (depending on what time of day/night you're trying to get your grub on.)\n\nMenu is nothing spectacular and is pretty standard. The Peppermill is really known for atmosphere and portion size. And the portions are pretty big. Hell, the cup of coffee was a thing of beauty for a coffee drinker like me.\n\nI opted for the eggs Benedict. My waitress uttered \"good choice\" when I ordered, so I expected something fabulous. What I got was .. eggs Benedict. Hey, poached eggs aren't exactly easy to get perfect, so I give them credit for perfectly cooked eggs with just the right amount of runny yolk. Other than that .. pretty standard. You do get 3 eggs instead of the usual 2, and a large portion of hash brown potatoes. Add your own salt and pepper and/or Tabasco, because the hollandaise sauce is pretty flavorless.\n\nOh, if you sit at the counter, watch your neighbors. The idiot that plopped down on the stool next to me decided he needed cream for his coffee and .. without a word to me .. reached across my plate to take cream out of the supply my waitress left for me. Didn't even apologize after he did it and realized that it wasn't \"for everyone\". D.B."

            "review": "Peppermill ended up being the place that most surprised me in Vegas, I wasn't really sure what to expect but now I recommend this place to anyone I talk to who is planning a trip to Vegas. \n\nWe came during the afternoon brunch so my I don't have anything to say about the Fireside Lounge [except that I really want to try it out next time]. \n\nWe came at a pretty random time, like 2 pm or something on a weekday and were quickly sat. The best way I can describe the interior is that it is like an old fashioned diner with a modern twist, it is colored blue, pink and purple! One thing I noticed is that it seemed well maintained and clean, unlike many old school diners and other places on the strip. \n\nService was prompt and friendly, checked on us the right amount of times while also letting us pig out in peace. \n\nThere were many many things I wanted to try on the menu but I opted for an omelet, it hit the spot and was a TON of tasty food. I definitely recommend this place for food after you have been walking the strip all day and have worked up an appetite. The price was more than reasonable for the amount of food you get and we all left stuffed and happy. We also left with a complimentary souvenir photo of our group - fun touch! \n\nIt is a fairly simple looking place from the outside during the day which could make it easy to miss, it is up on the northern part of the strip sorta near Circus Circus. \n\nIf you are looking for an affordable place to stuff your face in Vegas - definitely try the Peppermill!"

When you go inside, it almost looks like it used to be a strip club. I like the variety in the menu and each time I've had something different and I have no complaints yet. I don't know why, but I'm always amused by their sugar; it's very patriotic looking. This is the place I'd go to the morning after."

            "review": "A friend recommended we try this place while in vegas and since it's open 24 hr and was right in front of our hotel we gave it a try. \n\nIt was a Monday night at 1:30am. The decor looked like Prince threw up all over the restaurant. Very cheesy n tacky not to mention old. We had 4 diff ppl ask if we wanted drinks. The hostess asked even before we could look at the menu. After we receive our drinks she tells us the credit card machine is broken and to pay w cash. Ummm probably shouldve told us that before. But good thing I had cash which I usually don't. \n\nFood: how can u mess up chicken fingers and a house salad? For the prices they were charging for cafeteria food i expected them to get something right. Besides taking forever to get our food. The lettuce in the salad was browning. And the ranch was running like it had been diluted with water. I don't know if u could call it a salad because it was just iceberg lettuce and croutons for 5.95. The chicken fingers were so hArd they felt like biting into a brick. And their BBQ sauce tasted like hotsauce and ketchup. \n\nI'm not digging the hooker attire of the staff either. I will most definitely stick to the restaurants at the hotels."

The tangy chicken wrap was a let down, I did not like the sauce for the chicken but I think this place overall has good food. I want to come back and order other items. We also ordered champagne drink which I do not recall the name that was delicious. Champagne with muddled strawberries. Service was fast and nice but ask for a cocktail waitress because our waitress didn't know much about the drink menu"

            "review": "Buffets are overrated and the free breakfast at your mid-budget hotel is just cellophane bagels and hard-boiled eggs.  Solution?  The Peppermill.  It's freestanding, not buried in some casino, so you can park for free and be in the door right away.  If there is a wait, go hang out in the Fireside Lounge and have a delicious Bloody Mary.  It will quiet the demons.  \n\nUpon entering, you will see that the pink, purple, and aquamarine color scheme is so becoming when combined with the thousands of disco-ball mirrors lining the ceiling. Fuchsia neon gives the place all the warmth of a stretch limo circa your cousin's quinceanera in 1986.  The flamingo-patterned Tiffany-esque lampshades are the essence of class, as are the velour booths.  On every table is a dispenser full of rainbow sugar which matches the decor.\n\nIf you think all this sounds cheesy, I want you to know that the place is in perfect condition and squeaky, crazy, pristine clean.  Yes, there is a jungle of silk plants but not a speck of dust anywhere.  It is a lovely, inviting restaurant.  If you have ever been to the Madonna Inn, you will know what I am talking about: well-maintained kitsch is like a beautiful rhinestone-bedazzled Nudie suit one is never ashamed of wearing.  \n\nThe breakfast portions are enormous.  The fruit plate is more like a party platter for 12.  Two people could split an omelet and leave the table full.  The hash browns are crispy, not soggy or greasy.  \n\nThese are restorative foods.  Combined with the Peppermill's professional, attentive service, you can feel your hangover receding with each bite.  I always leave the Peppermill ready for my day's events, whether sunburning by the pool, shopping in the outlets, hiding in a dark hotel room watching \"Ladyhawke,\" gambling away my retirement savings, or braving the gridlock on the 15.  Go disco breakfast!"

It was my first time there, but I had always heard great things about this place, so I figured I'd share this as another first with my girl and I'm glad I made that decision. There's a lounge where you can just sit and have a drink by the fire (the drinks were awesome!) And the cocktail waitresses were so nice. After a few drinks, we walked over to the dining room, which had a 50's retro feel. Our server Samantha was so nice.

So when my wife and I were in Vegas, we decided to check out the Fireside Lounge. \n\nIt's a dark little bar lit mostly with Neon, there is their signature fire pit, a pool of water with fire bubbling out of it. Instead of regular tables, they have cozy little couches you sit in either next to the fire (which was a little too warm for our tastes in July) or roomy booths you can sit in. The atmosphere reminded me of a mix between a Hollywood portrayal of old school Vegas and a strip club... but not in a bad way. We both found it very comfortable and relaxing. \n\nThe service was fantastic! We never went without drinks, the waitress would check on us even if she could see that we were still working on our drinks. She answered questions, was very personable and polite. This was some of the best service we had in Vegas.\n\nWe wanted something light for lunch so we ordered the Crab cakes. WOW these were good! They where flaky, delicious and the sauce the drizzled on top complimented the crab flavor immensely! I would highly recommend giving them a try!\n\nWe had a couple of their specialty drinks. The Blue Hawaiian, which was our favorite. It was very good, and very blue! We also had the Scorpion, which is best described as a fishbowl filled with alcohol and ice cream, it was good, but it took the two of us almost an hour to finish it and it was very filling. After we were done, we were in a little bit of misery until we could walk it off. \n\nOne of the neatest novelty things this bar has is the drink guns. They can push one button on the gun and it will automatically pour the drink. It gives consistency to their signature drinks so no matter who makes it; it will always be the same. It's just neat to watch it in action."

Proportions can be ridiculously large!\n\nOn the night we went, we had plans for later in the evening and I didn't want to be too full... so I was a little concerned due to the size of their servings.  I ordered the cheeseburgers sliders which came with home made Yukon Gold Potato chips.  The sliders were... sliders, nothing spectacular, but the chips were awesome though I could not finish them.  My wife had the chicken pesto sandwich with onion rings, both of which she LOVED.\n\nWe returned a couple of days later for breakfast where I had the country fried steak and eggs which was good, though again I could not finish it (and I am a BIG eater) and she has the French Toast Ambrosia... which was ridiculously large!  It was so big a lady from the next table asked if she could take a picture of it!  \n\nI also noticed the gentleman across from us ordered the fruit plate which was not at all a fruit plate, it was a produce bar stacked on a plate!  I am not kidding, your could easily get your full eight servings of fruits and vegetables in one meal!\n\nThis place is a little pricy, however in most items you get enough to make two (if not more) meals.  Proportionally speaking it is very reasonable.\n\nTHE LOUNGE\n\nWe freakin' LOVE this lounge!  Again chrome and mirrors, red and blue neon, red velvet booths, and a fire spewing, boiling water fire pit!  I have always thought this would be exactly the kind of place where swingers would meet up prior to their assignations!\n\nThe waitresses all wear cocktail dresses which are very nice.  They prohibit you from wearing hats of any kind calling it their \"dress code\" but there are always people in there dressed in shorts and t-shirts so I am not too what the boundaries of this \"code\" are.  \n\nThey have a really cool menu advertising \"retro\" drinks like champagne cocktails, Manhattans, and scorpions in big bowls.   I ordered a Vodka Gimlet (which seems more and more to becoming an endangered species as far as bartenders go) and our friend ordered a Beautiful.  Both drinks were made correctly with no questions asked.  \n\nAgain this place can be pricy.  In fact we spent more here in the same amount of time as we did at Treasures, a very high end strip club.\n\nMoney aside, I would find a reason to go to Vegas just to hang out at the Peppermill Fireside Lounge.\n\nThe ONLY reason i don't give it 5 stars is the cost.\n\nEdit:  My wife's preferred drink this weekend was a Pina Colada.  She wanted me to point out that the Peppermill was the ONLY establishment that served her PC in a hurricane glass as it SHOULD be.  It may not seem important but it shows that they pay attention to the details."

It's down the strip near the Riviera Casino. \n\nWe walked into the lounge area as there was a wait for the diner side and decided we just had to hang out on the lounge side! The seating area is low back velour couches with little marble pedestal tables. There are neon lights and plastic flowers and mirrors! Oh the mirrors! Cue the 70's music!!!  The servers wear 70's style long black nightgowns and are very friendly. \n\nOk food and drinks- we tried a few of the specialty drinks (green tea martini, oatmeal cookie martini with ice cream of course, espresso martini, White Russian). They make a solid drink here. We ordered a few appetizers- be warned they are enormous. Our little pedestal table was overwhelmed. The food on the lounge side was basic bar appetizer fate- but it's the atmosphere that wins here. \n\nThere is a fire water table thing in the center of the lounge as well- very cool. Overall a very funky fun place to hang out. I will be adding it to my list of stops next trip.  \n\nDon't forget to break out your leisure suit!"

Still have found memories of that part of the strip so underdeveloped. All of sudden see small strip mall and all these neon lights. Not just lights talk about vibrant colors and ones that flash in and out. I remember the sign out front had even more personality but notice thats gone. =( Thankfully the restaurant still stands. It almost landmark of sorts knowing the history of the place combine with some of that Vegas style all its own. Really who would think place big fire pit right in the middle of the bar/lounge right next too the restaurant. Someone walking around asking if you want free pictures with The Peppermill as background. The diner style food breakfast, lunch, or dinner at anytime. The bright colors the waitress have on. Too all the trees (think fake) inside makes you feel like walked into another world. NO disneyland but one of those things see Vegas could drum up and pull off. \n\nI ended up getting the maserati omelette. Not like motherload of omelettte. It was smothered with lot of goodies. The best part was the meat sauce over the top of it combine with the egg and loaded filling. I barely finish half of it. It came with tasty hash browns. I enjoyed most was the nice crispy brown on the outside but yet moist on the inside. Along with your omelette get choice of bread or muffin. I went with the blueberry muffin. Nothing too rave about but still was good. Again huge muffin. My friend also had omelette. Seeing twins just as big. No doubt getting value on the strip here at The Peppermill. \n\nI would could come back again! =))"

We must have walked in at just the right time because we were immediately seated in this very eclectic, gaudy diner. The waitress attire varied between what looked like a 80s throwback soda girl outfit and a 90s style prom dress. Hilarious and awesome. \n\nFamilies were sat around us, no drunks, no rowdy people--as others have mentioned. And the menu was a classic, American diner reprieve from fancy or over-the-top touristy stops. Me likey. The prices were a little high for breakfast-fare, but again, this is Vegas. \n\nTheir eggs Benedict was the absolutely delicious and featured a split, well-toasted English muffin, topped with THREE poached eggs and some super-solid hollandaise sauce. And by \"super-solid\" I mean just classically delicious. No overly-powerful lemon punch, just well-balanced, rich goodness. Those hashbrowns were also off-the-charts good with fluffy and crunchy spots. I topped mine with Tabasco and loved that some of the yolks and hollandaise dressed the sides of the 'browns. \n\nAn honorable mention goes out to the coffee! Smooth, awesome diner coffee. \n\nAlso, this place doesn't look like it's changed much over the years, and really, that's part of its charm."

The exterior of the building looks rather unassuming aside from the neon \"Peppermill\" sign at the front, but once you walk through those doors you are officially in Vegas. The amount of neon lights is just unreal! The 50's diner/tropical oasis combo is something I am sad to have gone my 25 year life without experiencing. There are flamingos everywhere, and their tableside sugar is rainbow colored! If all of this doesn't scream Vegas to you, then all of the hungover/still partying people dining alongside you will!\nThis was our stop for breakfast before leaving Vegas on Sunday morning. Standard breakfast fare, but giant portions! I had the eggs bennie which was delicious! My husband had the biscuits and gravy that even a human vacuum like himself could not finish. My dad had the ham and eggs with a slice of ham bigger than his face.\nThe wait staff was really wonderful. Very quick and helpful. Overall, I truly enjoyed dining here and cannot wait to go again!"

Stepping in to the restaurant, I felt like I was in Vegas circa 1980 and had just awoken from a night of partying and invited a coke dealer stripper to breakfast with me. We had a huge party of like 15 people, so we waited in The Fireside Lounge until a table was ready. I sat at the bar and put $20 in a video poker machine and ordered a bloody mary, while some of the party went and sat around the bad ass indoor fire pit. Just a side note, you don't get free drinks if you gamble, so I paid eight bucks for the bloody mary. The machines have penny hands though so I just sat there and lost 80 cents in half an hour. The bloody mary was huge and was pretty good, but not spectacular or anything. When we got seated, they had a booth that fit all 15 of us except for two people in the party who sat in a booth next to us. Our server was seriously amazing, she was the best server I have ever had anywhere. She was super friendly and on top of everything, always coming back for refills and didn't make a single mistake on a 15 person order. When she brought the bill, she had split it 15 ways because she wasn't sure who was paying for who, now that's awesome. I got the Peppermill omelet which has turkey breast chunks and tomatoes with jack cheese and hollandaise covering the omelet. I subbed avocado for the tomatoes for no charge, and I think it was way better that way. When the food came, the omelet seriously looked like it had been made with a dozen eggs, it came with a huge order of hash browns and toast. The hash browns were thickly shredded and cooked perfectly. All in all this was a great meal to nurse my hangover on my last day in Vegas. Oh yeah, the price of the food was very reasonable, I think maybe ten bucks for the omelet that my obese ass couldn't even finish."

When we called for the manager to at least feedback to her what had happened, she said \"what will make us happy\"? So I said, comp the birthday girl's food. She did not do that but gave us 20% off. Anyway, we will not be back there again. :-(."

We were not disappointed!\n\nNone of us had been there before, so we made the mistake of ordering an entree each. Their servings are really big! I fill up fast, so I ended up taking more than half of my meal home. My aunt and I both ordered the Spinach and Feta omelette and I really enjoyed it. It had a good amount of feta cheese, which is a big deal to me. They serve it with potatoes and bread. I chose the blueberry muffin which was served warm. Yum!  \n\nMy mom ordered the fruit plate and it was enormous. It included strawberries, grapes, honeydew, banana, cantaloupe, pineapple and watermelon. They also give you a small banana nut loaf with marshmallow cream. It was so good!  \n\nMy grandma ordered the Pancake combo. It came with three large pancakes, three eggs, two bacon strips and two sausage links. It was a very large entree. I should also mention that I really enjoyed the coffee here. \n\nAll in all, it was a great and very filling meal. The service was really good as well. I'm sure we'll go back."

We went there on 2/25/12, sometime around noon-ish.  The decor is this strange mix of neon lights and faux exotic plant life (think blooming cherry trees and birds of paradise).  And the Fireside Lounge is too awesome for words.  We put our name in for a table, then went to the properly dark & swanky lounge to enjoy a couple Bloody Mary's.  It was the perfect place to zone out while sipping our tasty beverages as we continued to wake up from our very late night playing poker at Bill's Gamblin' Hall.  Once we got seated, I ordered the Feta & Vegetable Omelette.  It was scrumptious!!  It had spinach, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and provolone cheese on the inside, with crumble feta and tomatoes sprinkled on top.  The portion was easily large enough to serve two people and I could only eat half of it (that's a bummer, as I don't like wasting food).  PLUS, that half omelette with its usual breakfast sides were so filling that I just had a Nathan's hot dog later and was good for the rest of the night.  The service was also great, with our friendly and helpful server Jennifer.  Please do yourself a favor and have breakfast here at least once the next time you visit Las Vegas!"

Maybe it was the day and time that I actually came in, but I was really expecting more from this Vegas classic. The decor was basically strip club fluorescent purple tones with nothing that reminded me of Vegas of the 80's or late 70's when I used to go with my parents as a kid.\n\nThe food was good ( a step up from Denny's) and the service was decent. But the worst part of my experience was the patrons. I've never seen such a gathering of hipster douche bags with really bad tattoos - I wish I had my camera.  All I heard around me is people yelling loudly about how they had just rocked out at circus circus or partied at the stratosphere - which is not wrong, just something you don't want to be trying to show off about. My girlfriend and I couldn't even eat comfortably, so we just took our food to go.\n\nBottom line, if you want get the retro Vegas experience, go to downtown. Its changed, but some places like the horseshoe and especially the freemont still have that 70's and 80's Vegas feel to it. As far as the peppermill (fake retro) big disappointment, but I might try again possibly at a more reasonable time. I recommend it at least once in your life but keep you expectations low."

When you first walk in, the Vegas Denny's theme still holds true with one small exception. You will notice a double glass door in the back left corner that leads to the Peppermill's Fireside Lounge. The 5 stars is solely for the Fireside Lounge and not the Restaurant. \nYou instantly enter into a late 60's early 70's themed lounge that relaxes and surprises in the same breath. The decor looks like they actually had well kept furniture from the 70's imported through some kind of time portal and not the new furniture that is meant to look retro. I ordered the scorpion (Giant volleyball sized drink) because I saw Bourdain order it himself and our group loved it. We (my wife and myself) got it blended with the ice cream and the couple we were with got it on the rocks. Both are very tasty but I'd have to go with ice cream variety. We order the Peppermill sampler which had cheese sticks, chicken fingers, shrimp, and bruschetta to name a few. It served its purpose and tasted good but nothing too standout about it. \nThe service was on spot and great!! Peppermill's Fireside Lounge is a must stop if you're in the Vegas area. Great for pre/post parties or even being the main attraction. \nHere's my advice to the Peppermill owners- Keep up the great job and don't change a thing!!!"

They had very good food I'm a breakfast type guy so I ordered 3 pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage; it was a menu item but I forgot what it was called. My date ordered the 3 cheeseburger sliders and onion rings. Like I said the food was very good and they have large portions so make sure when you come you have a pretty empty stomach, we didn't even finish our food but they made for great leftovers."

Luckily, they have a lounge area where you can order drinks and sit in front of a fire pit over water while you wait to be called. The Fireside Lounge definitely gives you a reminiscent vibe of old school Vegas with the pink and purple neon lights.  \n\nAfter my second Bloody Mary, the hour flew by quickly! ;) Once seated, I ordered the steak and 3 eggs, which came with hashbrowns and your choice of toast or muffins ($19 before tax). The portions were HUGE! I was pleasantly surprised by how tender the steak was! I ordered the eggs over medium and it was cooked to my exact preference. As for the hashbrowns, it was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. It really is a great diner and I could see why it was so packed! This place is great for any meal of the day since they are open 24 hours."

You won't be too disappointed by the MASSIVE portions.  I mean, pancakes larger than a frisbee (but luckily very soft and fluffy).  But beware, these portions can't really be finished unless you're a serious eating machine (or you're sharing one meal with, like, four people), and you will pay for them.  VERY expensive for what's essentially \"diner\" food.  For the experience, I think it's worth it once. \n\nI like that the cocktail waitresses come by almost right after you sit down to see if you want spirits from the Fireside lounge.  The service is hit or miss.  For instance, if you say you need a \"minute\" to review the menu, be prepared to wait a lifetime for the server to come back.  \n\nThere is a photographer that comes by to take a free souvenir photo of your party.  We got it one time and the last time we went, we were gone before they came back to give it to us.  \n\nLet the bright lights draw you in; enjoy the over-the-top decor and a decent meal."

Mozzarella cheese, fresh basil instead of lettuce a nice touch, red onions some were hard and not good so I had to pick them off, tomato, Prosciutto (prosciutto was old and hard had to pick that off as well) and pesto (lots almost to much pesto) sauce on a ciabatta the bun was awesome.  All burgers come with the choice of french fries, onion rings or potato salad (I had onion rings pretty awesome as far as onion rings go ;)\n\nI do think however I would come back for some late night drinks in the bar area they are really cool looking and the setting, fire pits and appetizers are pretty good I hear!

It was not on the strip, so I was a little unsure about heading there at first, but it is more than worth it. We were there for breakfast and the omelets were huge! The menu is pretty extensive, mostly basic dinner food, but something for everyone. I am a lover of breakfast to begin with, but I was over the moon about this place. Did I mention their sugar is colored? At first glance, it almost looks like glitter! LOVE! The service was quick and everyone was friendly. The waitresses wear uniforms that go along with the ambiance of the place: Vegas meets townie dinner meets flamingos...very neat little place that I would have never found if it weren't for a friend who visits her family. I will definitely be returning for another breakfast or two on our next trip to Vegas! Go and get an omelet, you won't be disappointed!"

I loved the multi-colored sugar on the table, the kitschy decor, and even the huge portions, which are typical for diner establishments, but the food just wasn't that good even under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe Peppermill is considered to be a LV institution with extremely kitschy decor (think of fake trees, neon lights and vinyl wrap-around booths). It's right across the street from Circus Circus, giving it somewhat of a creepy vibe at night. This area of the strip just feels dead now. \n\nMy review is based mainly on the food, which was surprisingly lackluster. I expected it to be at least better then IHOP, but it reminded me of Denny's. I ordered a cheeseburger that was pretty greasy and my friend's salad was made out of iceberg lettuce with huge piles of fruit that looked unappetizing. My sweet potato fries were okay, but tasted like they were previously frozen.\n\nI would have given it a higher rating, but I expect diners to have good \"junk food.\" I think The Peppermill may be better for breakfast, and it's definitely worth a stop if you are interested in Vintage Las Vegas. Also noteworthy is procuring a bag of multi-colored sugar (yes, they do sell it at the register)!"

The cocktail waitress were very friendly and courteous, but our waitress seemed to be having the worst day of her life. \n\nUpon being seated a server brought us our drinks but he wasn't the server. We waited on our server another 10 minutes before I decided to say something. I ask a random server for help and eventually they track down our server, Elisha. I don't want to pile on her as the worst, because she brought out our food fairly quickly. What I didn't like was her attitude. From her \"I guess you're ready to order\" when I asked to for a server to her slamming my change on the table after I paid for our meal. \n\nIn sum, great food but the service is shaped by the server."

WTF. This wasn't a necessarily cheap cocktail for a coffee shop type of place, I expected a bit more than what I got. I didn't finish it. \n\nI didn't have one, but the desserts looked great."

What i love about this place obviously is the 24 hours of service, very \"Vegas\" ambiance (neon everywhere with mirror walls) and very good food and service. Service again is awesome, they even have cocktail waitresses that serve alcohol with your dinner. \n\nI would recommend hands down the BBQ pork ribs dinner , the meat is so tender it falls off the bones and the rack is so big it hangs off the plate. Get it with a side of onion rings, chicken chowder soup and a coke and you are set! Other notable favorites include the Chicken Fried Steak, Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Lasagna.\n\nThe lounge inside the restaurant is also pretty fun especially if you are like me and do not really prefer the loud expensive ass clubs on the strip."

Once you get inside other reviews called it a Denny's wannabe while others compare the decorating to a cruise ship. I think both of those descriptions are appropriate, only in a very positive way. Our server came to the table right away. She took our drink orders and answered questions about the menu. The couple we went with had there before. They warned us about the size of the portions and so we decided to share a salad. Boy that was enough. We had the steak salad. They prepared the steak perfectly. Volume of food was huge. We certainly did not leave hungry. I would recommend this restaurant for an informal meal at a very reasonable price. Don't expect anything fancy. But the food is good and I will plan to go back again."

I ordered the focaccia chicken sandwich along with curly fries. My only complaint was that the bread was a bit dry but the chicken was cooked perfectly and the curly fries were greet too. The ranch was sub par, but I'm somewhat of a ranch snob. \n\nThe service was a little bit slow but eh it's on the strip technically so what do you expect.

The cheese was hard and when I mentioned it to the waitress, she said that's how they always are. Hmm...ok.

It's messy and that is how I like them. A few times I ordered breakfast and it seems like my friends always order breakfast too. It's pretty good, nothing special.\n\nOverall, if you want a fun atmosphere, this is your place. It's not the cheapest place for breakfast on the strip but its gonna cost more than if you go a street over, even though it's kinda in an empty part of the strip.Thinking about it, some of the stuff on the menu is way overpriced but you're paying for the location and atmosphere! If you're a tourist, I would go here! This place has been around for a long time and it has been in a lot of TV shows, so that's kinda fun too.\n\nI almost forgot my favorite thing to order here...the banana split.

The Peppermill has not changed in years and full of enough neon to have their own Neon Museum.  I love it!!\n\nThe food portions tend to be the highlight at the Peppermill.  Every dish is on steroids.  For the bros out there, I don't mean that literally.  They hook it up to the max at the Peppermill and still manage to keep the price per meal very low.  I used to come here for their burgers, fries, nachos, and desserts.  They're all good.  But now, it's all about their 10 egg omelets.  That's not a typo...10 freakin' eggs AND it's still served with toast & hash browns.  I even talked to one of the shift leaders and she stated that most people eat only half of their meals here.  Well, not this guy. I will deMELish their omelets every chance I get.  They're omelets are so good that it would be a shame if I had any leftovers. \n\nThis restaurant is always busy and a wait for a seat should be expected.  The service is top notch as well.  I highly recommend the Peppermill, especially if you're craving a beast of an omelet. \n\nJust a note...\nSome people have mentioned that the Peppermill looks like strip club inside. All that's missing is a stripper pole.  I beg to differ with these people and think they got it backwards.  I think a strip club looks more like a Peppermill.  All that's missing is their 10 egg omelet.  \n\n2017 Yelp Review #52"

            "review": "I waiver between 4 and 5 stars on this. I'm at about a 3.5 to 4 for the Peppermill Restaurant and a solid 5 for the Fireside Lounge.\n\nLet's start with the Fireside Lounge. This is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I've loved it since I first visited Vegas years and years ago. It's one of the first places that springs to mind when I think of \"old Vegas\". This little tucked away lounge is both classy and neon. It's both laid-back and fun. I can just picture any classic Vegas star sitting on a couch here.\n\nThe Fireside Lounge is pretty small. When you walk into the Peppermill, you'll see a small glass door off to your left labeled \"Fireside Lounge\". When you walk through it, you'll see lots of blues, pinks, and greens, bits of neon, mirrors, and plenty of fake plants and trees. But it so works, it feels classy - old Vegas classy.\n\nTo your right is a small, low bar with some video poker. To your left is a large indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing. Around the indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing is a huge circle couch. Around the rest of the room are smaller couches and some chairs - in an array of different sizes to accommodate just your size group. And the way it is all laid out, it is not too hard to find a private corner for some snuggling.\n\nOn corners around the room are TVs playing all sorts of music videos. Sometimes it 80s hair bands, sometimes it's a live Pearl Jam show. It's different just about every time I go. And it's never too loud. It's just there in the background, providing ambiance and conversation starters.\n\nThe best part is that the cocktail waitresses wear long, black evening gowns. It just adds to the whole environment and experience. There's a decent cocktail list and bar snack menu. Don't expect anything inventive here (though, they have been trying some new martinis). It's all classic and old-fashioned (and that is what is going to taste the best here). Think Mai Tai and shrimp cocktail.\n\nCombine all that with it being open-24 hours and you've got a must-do. It can be a romantic spot for couples and a chill spot for a group of guys or gals. And I've seen a few celebrities here too. Not the type that host at Pure, but the type that you might catch performing at The Joint.\n\nAnd I have to add that the staff at the Fireside are pretty open and willing to accommodate. My husband decided to surprise me with an Elvis impersonator for my birthday, and he set it all up with Fireside for this Elvis to come in and sing to me. So yeah, Fireside is totally a 5 star place.\n\nSo on to the Peppermill Restaurant. Sure, there are better 24 hour restaurants in Vegas, but almost none with this kind of atmosphere. And the food is well above average. I can't say I've eaten here a lot, but the handful of times I have, I haven't had any complaints. \n\nThe portions are huge - so don't be afraid to share. My favorite menu items are actually the omelettes. They're huge and flavorful (no going stingy on the cheese and fillers here), and they just really hit the spot after a long night of drinking and gaming. 3.5 stars for the food, but add 1/2 a star for the ambiance.\n\nThe Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge are novelty Vegas places not to be missed."

There was a wait list and it was cool that we got to hang out in the fireside lounge and get some drinks while waiting in a dark, mysterious lounge by a fire that was surrounded by water. In a way this diner was a bite too dark and it pretty old school retro. I mean it is a diner and at least they did something interesting about this place lol. After our wait was over we got seated, there were fake trees surrounding the booths and was not as dark as the lounge area. \n\nMe and my bf split the Joe's San Francisco Special after asking the waitress if the food portion is share able and she said yes so we just shared it. OMG the food portion size is huge! Good thing we shared because it was also so filling that we could not even finish it.... The food itself was interesting it seems to be it could of been scrambled eggs with spinach , plus some pork sausage on the side, with hash browns, and all covered on top like a nacho cheese sauce but instead its all layered in the dish as one whole meal!  It was quite yummy! Will come back here again if I come to Vegas again!"

I've never actually been here for breakfast, although I've been here during \"breakfast hours,\" but I have heard their breakfasts are great.\n\nNo, it's not new, extremely clean, or filled with gorgeous modern decor, it is more along the lines of Vegas in the 70's, at least everything I can imagine that was good about Vegas in the 70's:)  I once heard that this is one of the oldest operating businesses in Vegas but I'm not sure if that is true.\n\nTheir bloody mary's are delicious, the portions are large, and they have a large selection of finger type snack foods,  which is good after a drunkin' or somehow otherwise intoxicated evening:)  The service is always top notch and the waitresses, no matter what age, are all attractive and wear long black dresses.  Yes, that may seem cheesy but personally, I think it is unique and I love it!\n\nEverything from the red velvet seating to the hot tub like fire place contraption to the mirrored walls with christmas looking lights everywhere help add to the perfect \"old school\" Vegas type of experience.\n\nI \"heard\" that lots of \"dancers\" like to hang out here after their shifts are over at the various gentleman's clubs....wink, wink:)"

It's so weird, it's awesome, it was one of the highlights of my trip, no lie. \n\nPeppermill feels like to stepped in a time capsule into a diner with odd waitresses wearing ball gowns.  The food is cheap and very very good.  They are open 24 hours, and have a super cool little lounge that was filmed on Gigolos (If you haven't seen it google, no judgement here :))  We ordered sandwiches all round, with sweet potato fries.  Everything we had was a super large portion and very tasty.  \n\nThe lounge part is my favorite with a big sunken in room with a large fire pit right in the middle.  Drinks are reasonable, and service was fast.  Def. a cool little spot to get your grub on at 3a.m. or romantic spot for drinks.  Loved it!"

I had to devote a place I actually LIKE for #500!!!\nI'm a sucker for reality tv, reading books by celebrities, etc.  Holly Madison mentioned that this was one of her favorite places, and I think one of her reality show episodes had her peeps dining here.  This is also a favorite of the locals, so I visited this place for breakfast with friends a few years ago...the portions were HUGE, and we actually remembered this as being a \"favorite\" of ours.  Las Vegas has numerous restaurants to choose from so if you remember a good one...you'll want to return rather than taking a risk elsewhere.\n\nI was back there this past weekend, and I asked my friend where she wanted to go for dinner...she didn't care.  Since we had a car this time I suggested Ellis Island, or Peppermill.  She's not much of a beer drinker, so I thought she'd like the ambiance in this place better so we stopped in again.  There is lots of parking in the lot here.  This place has a 70's roller disco kind of vibe to it... it's cute, totally not cheezy!  VERY \"Vegas\" I might add.  Of all my facebook check ins while I was out there...this place had the most \"love that place\" comments from my peeps back home.  \n\nPortions are HUGE here...you will not leave hungry.  The staff are great too.  This time we just got a few appetizers and drinks (we both ordered the \"bubble bath\").  There is a lot of mention of the nachos so we got those and barely made a dent in them, we got them with chicken too.  We also got the sliders which were very tasty.  I will absolutely keep coming back to this place when visiting Vegas, and you should too!"

We went on a Thursday, well, early Friday morning and it was the perfect amount of busy. There were 4 of us and we found a place to sit right away. The seating is cool and intimate. The actual fire lounge area is meant more for couples as the couches that circle it only seat 2 people. \n\nLooking around the joint, it was a good mix of people. There were some couples on dates, the obvious locals, larger groups and everyone was having a chill, good time.\n\nThe specialty drinks are as tacky as the decor and again, I say that in the most loving way. The four of us shared a big ass fruity drink called the Scorpion and then ordered 4 separate cocktails. We also ordered the sampler platter that consisted of fried chicken strips, fried mozarella, fried shrimp, onion rings and bruscetta, basically drunk people food :) Our bill was only about $70!\n\nAs far as I know it's open 24 hours, it's in the dicey area of the strip but who cares! It's worth the possible mugging  ;) We only hung out in the lounge area, didn't check out the restaurant so I can't comment on that.\n\nThis will be on our list of things to do while in Vegas for now on without a doubt."

Way back in the day, during my first trips to Vegas, back when I was really young and didn't know any better, I thought The Peppermill was one of the coolest places everrrrrr! Some guy took me here and I remember being so impressed. He had arranged for us to sit at one of those nice romantic, sunken-in fireplace areas and was acting like he had to pull some major strings to get us sat there but was able to pull it off because he was some big shot Vegas local, yada yada yada... I can almost hear my old self saying, \"Oh my gosh, you mean they have actual fireplaces in there and we can sit next to them? WOW!!!!!\" I seriously must have been easily amused and/or completely wasted because this place is proof that some things are better left in the past as memories...\n\nI can't believe I was in such awe of The Peppermill back in the day. *SMDH* Boy times have changed! I walked in after having talked about how cool I remembered this place being and I was instantly embarrassed. My friend gave me that, \"Really Bobbi? This is THE Peppermill?\" puzzled look. Sadly, it was nowhere near as cool as I had remembered it being. The design is completely old school and tacky as all get out by today's standards. There are mirrors everywhere (I think even on the ceilings... bowmp chicka wow wow) and tons of neon. It reminded me of a scene out of the video game Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards. Nate M. said it best, \"Is it a strip club or a Denny's on psychedelics?\" I could not stop giggling about the cheesy decor and for that I give this place three stars, for the entertainment value alone. I had a blast laughing at my past self while reading other's perceptions of this place. \n\nThis is your basic diner/greasy spoon restaurant that is open 24/7. Yes, The Peppermill is pretty famous but the food is nothing to write home about. If you're looking to feel like you've time warped into a scene from Austin Powers or people watch, this is the place. They serve those big touristy fishbowl style drinks that you can share with multiple straws. Service was good. \n\nDress like Larry from Three's Company and take someone on a date here and with a straight face, spritz some breath spray into your mouth, lean over and tell them this is your favorite restaurant, I dare you. LOLZ!"

            "review": "Peppermill is a fixture on Las Vegas Blvd.  Located just south of the old Rivera Hotel and Casino, it's within walking distance of the casino properties on the north end of the Strip.  I had heard about it for years and they have a website that makes the place look pretty darned cool.  I finally made it there when a relative came into town, was staying on the Strip and wanted to meet us near their hotel. It was the right time to give The Peppermill a try.\n\nHonestly, everything was just okay.  Certainly nothing was bad or wrong, but nothing was better than average.  I was a little surprised.  We went back again several weeks later, but the experience was the same.\n\nThe waitstaff did just what waitstaffs do:  seated us, took our order, filled our drinks when they were empty (but didn't keep them from going empty), and brought us our check when we appeared to be finished.  They didn't take too long for anything and didn't rush us either.  Get in, eat, get out.  Average.\n\nThe food was average too.  This was disappointing since I had heard so much about The Peppermill before--almost all very positive.  I don't even remember what I had the first time, and I rarely forget what I order at a place the first time I'm there.  The second time I ordered the Southwestern Beef Kabobs.  They tasted fine, but were overcooked and dry as a result.  I'm pretty sure they sat under a heating lamp while the other dishes were being prepared since the vegetables were also dry.  Again, not bad, but not really great either.  I'd expect this kind of food in a roadside diner, not in a fairly well-known restaurant and arguably a feature on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nThe atmosphere is unique but nothing special.  It's certainly a cool change from sitting in another generic restaurant, but it seems they may have once been a special place but have now forgotten they're on The Strip in the middle of a city known for an amazing assortment of all kinds of amazing restaurants and a huge variety of food.  The website make the place look very cool.  Better on the web than in person.  Once again, not bad but not great either.  Just average, and I'm not sure average can survive on The Strip these days.\n\nParking is super easy:  park right there in front of the restaurant.\n\nI sincerely hope The Peppermill doesn't go the way of the old Sahara and the Riviera.  They could be something great.  (They SHOULD be something great.)  If you're on that part of Las Vegas Blvd and need a decent place to eat, it'll certainly suffice.  But with all the choices within just a few miles, I'd honestly go elsewhere.  There are too many other great restaurants to chose from.  Even though The Peppermill is okay, because they don't seem to care about where they are or what they could be, I can't give it more than two stars."

In other words, you're freakin' wasted. \n\nYour world is starting to spin and you need some food to keep functioning (and to ensure you don't puke or OD). You stumble into a Denny's and you are blown away by weird neon colors, friendly service, and good food at great prices featuring out of this world portions. You are so amazed by the experience you feel you as if you are dreaming, high, or both.\n\nWell, the paragraph above pretty much describes my recent experience(s) at the Peppermill, except that I was not on a Charlie Sheen style bender. Even stone cold sober and pissing holy water, I was amazed by the food, service, and of course, the neon colored look and feel of the place.\n\nAfter a long day of traveling and working, I came here for dinner and had a delicious half pound burger with grilled mushrooms, Swiss cheese, crispy bacon, fresh produce featuring onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and a delicious dill pickle that Snookie would salivate over. With my entree, I was given the option of a side of fries, curly fries, or onion rings. I opted for the hot and crispy curly fries. And when I say side, I mean a 2,500 calorie mountain.\n\nIt was a quality meal and well priced ($16 including tip), considering it was more than enough for two people or maybe even three. But of course, being a nasty pig, I devoured the entire burger and ate as many curly fries as a I could until I felt there was a pimple forming at the end of my nose. \n\nI was so impressed by the meal and the service, I let my impressive server (who was in training at the time and being shadowed by another server), that I would be back the following day. As I wasn't pulling a Charlie Sheen, the next day I kept my word and returned with my coworker. Word is bond, yo.\n\nThis time around, I had a chicken focaccia sandwich filled with thick slices of avocado, prosciutto, provolone cheese, all served a side of Balsamic vinaigrette. The sandwich was delicious. This time around I opted for some tasty onion rings that gave me enough grease on my face to start a fire, a small pimple, and a pair of busted slacks. Whatever. I like being fat. No, really. I swear.\n\nIn the end, this has become one of my new favorite places to eat in \"The Vegas,\" even if the food makes my face look young (greasy and pimply) and body look old (round and fat). Good food and good times, even without a Charlie Sheen recipe for disaster."

After rumors circulated in the car that Holly from Girls Next Door dines there often, I assumed it was in the Planet Hollywood or another reputable hotel. Not the case. It is a completely random single-floor standalone restaurant dwarfed on both sides by megacasinos. They did have a private surface parking lot out front though which was convenient. My spirits began to rise again when I saw the interior - a lushly decorated 1980s bonanza of neon lights and big plastic trees...very disorienting, very stimulating, very Vegas. We got a nice big booth by the window and were only temporarily bothered by screaming children. The menu is extremely long and not in a good way. Not only does everything look atherosclerosis-inducing, it's not the guilty pleasure kind of bad food. Also, the alcohol menu is just a jumbled mix of everything - beer alongside cocktails alongside wine, with no explanations. I ordered a Salty Dog thinking it was a beer label I recognized and was rather disappointed to find that it was a vodka-pineapple. My pesto burger was weird but pretty good. To top it all off, they wouldn't let us split the bill, so we endured a long confusing argument with the cashier over how to pay. \n\nOne star for decor, one for the pesto burger. 'Nuff said."

The coffee was standard diner stuff.  I ordered pancakes, eggs, potatoes, and sausage which was all very well and good but nothing groundbreaking.  My wife ordered the fruit plate and that is where the magic happened.  This fruit plate was HUGE!!!  So big, in fact, that we took about half of it back to our hotel and ate it with a bagel for the following breakfast the next day.  It had strawberries, kiwi, oranges, apples, cantaloupe, watermelon, and probably other stuff too.

It reminded me of Hala Kahiki (Anyone from the Chicago area should know what I am talking about) yet way cleaner and prettier.  I loved the fire pits surrounded by water.  What a cool picture I have of me sitting by one.  This was just enough away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip to not feel like a tourist trap (even though I'm sure it is).  The drinks they had were mostly the overly sweet variety for 21 year olds and that's why they didn't get 5 stars from me."

Certainly not a bad breakfast option, but not worth a long walk from your hotel, either (if you are at Riviera or Circus Circus, though, check it out). Omelets are huge but filled with too much cheap American cheese, hash browns were rather hard and unappetizing. Maybe I caught them on a bad day...\n\nI liked the blue and purple lighting and the 70's-style round booths. Waitresses wore \"Hawaiian truck stop\" floral print dresses and were exceptionally nice and attentive. Much better service than the average 24-hour hotel restaurant.\n\nCan't comment on the dinner menu or late night experience - I'll have to go back and try it.  Overall I liked the place, and would be more likely to return soon if it weren't a little out of my way."

When growing up in the late 70's, it was one of our go to spots for large portions of good comfort food, and busty, statuesque cocktail waitresses in flowing gowns.  Man, I remember the colored sugar in bottles on all the tables too...\n\nThere are no more Peppermills in the Bay Area, but this one still survives and is a throwback to that seventies diner.  Yes it's ghetto and cheesy, but think of Denny's, Carrow's, or Norm's but with big booth seating, neon lighting, and chrome accents and that's pretty much the way it was.  The colored sugar is gone, but the portion sizes are still decent.  I don't think I would come here to order steak or pasta, but standard diner fare is fine...\n\nThat said we had:\n\n- The Peppermill Burger w/fries;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=nS6W0CdWP3Wd7CR9WKqkQA\n- The Swiss & Mushroom Burger w/onion rings;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=l2N9_HOlwejbZodafUdzKw\n- The Reuben sandwich w/fruit cup;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=c5ZgwLXL2S4FVSqU2Czkfw\n- Chicken Caesar Salad w/Rosemary Rustique bread;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=pjr7B7xYy25-DWS1zRAr3Q\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=77R2zAj7PfGnm3vU4G7BJg\n\nThe soup and salad comes with the Rosemary bread but only offered a tossed green or spinach salad, so for a little more, I added the soup of the day to my burger and gave it to my daughter so that she could have her soup and salad with a Chicken Caesar instead...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=ETvzWnTaDmgHQ2kk_cUx4w\n\nThe food is nothing spectacular, but the service was even and attentive, no problems throughout...\n\nI once talked to the concierge at the Bellagio for dining recommendations, 'where do the locals go?'  I asked.  I think he oversold this place because he told me then that this was where all the strippers and showgirls went.  HAH!  Maybe that's why I always see hairy truck driver types in wife beaters hanging out.  Then again, it got me interested in coming here to give it a try.  Open 24 hours, I would come back for diner food, or dessert, or breakfast -- even though I've never seen any stripper or showgirl quality patrons, or even any leggy cocktail waitresses for that matter..."

Easily found a parking spot so I had a good feeling it might not be that bad, but then saw a mass of people outside, then a mass of people inside. Uh oh...its got to be a 45 minute wait and I'm starving, so I started to think of where else to go as I approached the hostess stand. \"It will be about 10-15 minutes\" she said. Wow!\n\nAnd it was about 10 minutes. This place knows how to move people in and out fast. Within mere seconds of sitting down, a waitress drops off the 24 hour menus and takes a quick drink order. I ordered the eggs benedict and my friend buffalo wings, extra hot. Food was out in about 10 minutes.\n\nEggs benedict comes with 3 poached eggs over two English muffins and a side of potatoes. All was cooked great. Hollandaise sauce was a bit lacking in flavor though. I'll give the food 3 stars. Nothing special. My friend said her wings weren't that spicy. They were pretty good sized though.\n\nOverall, the service is what makes this place special, along with the cool decor. While sitting there we were approached for bar drinks twice, and a free photo which I doubt is actually free. My first time here I had a chicken fried steak which was pretty decent, but the eggs benedict weren't all that this time so I'll try another meal next time I'm back."

I still remember my shock at the size of the pancakes when it arrived at the table. So, I thought \"okay, the portion sizes here are impressive\". Then I took a bite and this is hands down the fluffiest pancake I've ever had! \n\nMy Maserati Omelette was also enormous - I wouldn't be surprised if they used a whole carton of eggs to make this beauty.

I was craving breakfast and I had a huge selection to choose from. After much convincing from our server Nick (who was quite awesome btw) I went for the Maserati Omelet. Filled with mozzarella cheese and sauteed mushrooms and then topped with an Italian sausage marinara sauce. This is totally not the type of thing I would order but I am so glad I did as it was pretty stellar. \n\nOur bfast portions were beyond huge. I think it was advertised as a 3 egg omelet but there had to be at least 5 eggs or they get their eggs from pretty large chickens if not. \n\nNick was our server and he was great! Service was great all around from the hostess, to the guy who took our drink order and to the cocktail server. Will totally return here next time in Vegas and needed some late night Vegasy eats."

It's typical old-school Vegas gaudy and very crowded. We waited an hour and 20 minutes on a weekday to be seated (now lunch-time) but were looking forward to the food because of the reviews.  They offered us cocktails while we waited (at 10am?  Well, it's Vegas, I guess).\n\nFirst, the service was excellent.  The waitress was hustling and she kept up with all of her tables.  She was also very polite and attractive.\n\nBut that was where the good points ended.\n\n I got the corned-beef hash because it seemed to be one of the highest rated breakfast dishes.  Where I live, I'm used to corned-beef hash being fresh corned-beef sliced thin and layered over oven-roasted potatoes with sauteed onions and peppers and poached/basted eggs.  I was happily anticipating this sort of dish based on how stellar the reviews were.  Instead, I got a HUGE bowl of what seemed to be Hormel corned beef hash from a can with two basted eggs plopped on top.  Other than the minced potatoes mixed in with the copious amounts of \"meat\" and 4 slices of fresh (but well refrigerated) green tomato as a garnish, there were absolutely no vegetables.\n\nI'm no stellar cook, but I would not serve food of this quality (or lack thereof) to guests at my home, let alone try to pass it off as a dish in a restaurant.  I also thought the size was overkill.  I HATE wasting food, particularly meat, but as a normal large (NOT fat) man, I was only able to eat about 1/3 of this dish and still walked away uncomfortably full, and being on a trip was not able to take any home with me (sad).\n\nI can only surmise that the people who rate this place 4 and 5 stars are:\n\na. rating service only.\nb. into \"all you can eat\" style dining.\nc. tourists from places with nothing resembling a decent restaurant.\n\nSorry, but it was big waste of time and money.

The food was great I had the eggs Benedict probably the best eggs Benedict I have had in a while. \nThe only thing that I have to complain about is the wait it took for us to be seated... Have no fear they have a full bar and fire pit to keep you entertained while you wait... James the bartender was AMAZING!!!!! He had great recommendations and was up for the challenge of being our bartender!!!! Overall, this was a great place and I will definitely be back!"

My cohorts went to bed early because of a long day ahead for tomorrow, but I'm a late night person (usually go to bed around 3:30-4am) so I left them in the room & went exploring. We were staying at Circus Circus, and after walking around for an hour just checking things out I decided to kill a little bit of time playing slots. Now, I'm not into gambling but I figured I'm in Vegas so I might as well do a little bit of gambling. Within 5 minutes of sitting down I won over $20 on a slot machine so I decided I would cash out & use the money for a late night steak dinner. I didn't see anything at Circus Circus that fit the bill so I went out walking and within a few blocks saw The Peppermill. I figured that was the place.\n\nIt was pretty much packed so I sat at the counter. After looking the menu over I quickly decided on the New York Strip & eggs. The place was bustling with patrons & countless waitresses buzzing around. I ordered my steak rare, my eggs sunny side up, the hash browns crispy & an English muffin. The waitress was nice, friendly & attentive.\n\nEverything came out as ordered. The 'shred' on the hash browns were larger than typical but I found them to make the texture even better than the normal shred. I found nothing wrong with each item in my dinner. The steak was rare, tender & trimmed properly. Eggs were spot on sunny side up. Hash browns crispy. Everything was exactly what I was wanting in a late night dinner. Adding a few dollars for a tip to my winnings, I paid & left satisfied."

There's also a guy coming around to the tables taking pictures trying to get you to buy them. They're super cute, but does anyone actually buy those?!\n\nThe portions are HUGE HUGE HUGE. The two of us couldn't finish an omlette, a bowl of clam chowder, and a milkshake! Hell, we only finished half of it! We're big eaters too x_x I don' remember which omlette we ordered, but it had a lot of meat and it was okay at first but pretty sickening after a while. The vanilla shake was good. It's the thick kind, which usually isn't my thing. Clam chowder was way too salty and just not good. I think a can of Campbell's Chunky clam chowder is 100x better! \n\nI think the Peppermill would be a perfect late night filler, but I don't think I'd come here again unless I was seeking out drunk food."

So I decided to have brunch here for my 30th birthday. A milestone celebration. I ordered a Mediterranean Omelet that was supposed to have crab and shrimp and cheese. The omelet came full of shrimp and cheese. I found no crab. I asked them to remake it. The waitress spoke to the manager. The manager told her no, that they would not remake my omelet. They would take it off of my check. But I was then left with a half made omelet. I highly doubt I will be returning. I don't recommend this location. What a downer."

Imagine if Big lots sold a furniture line they called Gothic rainbow. Now imagine you're looking at it through purple shades and that's what the place looks like in daylight. They also have Tiffany style lamps with flamingos on them - someone should go to jail for that. Did I mention the ceiling is covered in black mirror tiles? \nThe large portions are no compensation for the underwhelming quality of the ingredients. Sour 1980s Gas station coffee, flavourless vegetables, and the cheese in my omelet resembled a generic version of a Kraft cheese slice."

The pancakes and hashbrowns were also tasty. \n\nThe Peppermill is a must see when you are in Vegas. The Fireside Lounge next door is beyond kitschy and has all kinds of tropical drinks,  even some non-alcoholic ones. They serve honey roasted peanuts and play ridiculous music videos.  If there's a wait for a table at the diner,  take a seat at the bar and wait while sipping a Zombie or virgin Pina Colada."

It is a Vegas must, open 24 hours and known for its large kitschy drinks and breakfast items. I lived in Las Vegas in 1998 when they were still building the Bellagio, and the Strip looked very different. I remember well coming out of the lounge side of the Peppermill, having eaten their Ambrosia French Toast or their pancakes, and seeing the retired strippers in their therapeutic tennis shoes and their car wash skirts with suspenders running pots of coffee around the restaurant side while the counter was lined with pilots in their uniforms. The restaurant gets busy now, but it has always been popular, and I visit when I can."

We were disappointed at our experience because we had read good reviews and thought we would like to try this Vegas staple. It does not live up to its hype and really didn't look to have much to offer as I looked at people's plates on the walks in and out.

It's the ultimate cool, nightlife vibe sans the crazy Strip Tourists and the annoying energy that they always bring. You know, the energy  that screams... \"I'm 21.. in town for the weekend from Cali , and I'm going to Pure!.\"  You get the drift. \n\nThis is a place that locals haunt.  And if you are an out of towner and just happen to be here, then that's probably because some kind hearted  local took pity on you and told you about it. \nSo enjoy.

Chicken tenders, cheese sticks, shrimp, and GIANT onion rings.  If I had a complaint, it would be the onion rings are too big.  Also with the mass of grease is a few pieces of Bruschetta.  Thet were good, but the tomatoes seemed as if they had been marinating too long, kinda squishy.\n\nDinner, I had the Ciabatta Pesto Burger.  Beef, Ciabatta bread, pesto, red onion, tomato, pancetta, fresh mozzarella, and instead of lettuce.... a crapload of basil leaves.  This is now one of the top 5 burgers I have ever had in my life.

When I went this last January, I finally made the time to get over there for a 3:00pm breakfast. If I knew what I know now about the Peppermill, I'd beat my own ass for not going sooner.\nThe lettering on the outside said a lot when I see \"PEPPERMILL\" spelled out in a rainbow of neon lights.  My friend Kristina and I skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment. Chills ran down our spines as we were slapped in the face with what I can only describe as pure neon splendor. A resounding WOW was all we could say until the hostess made us snap out of it and asked how many in out party. I couldn't help but ask her, \"Do you get a headache working here?\" She giggled and said,\" When I first started, I thought there was no way I could work here for long, but you get use to it.\" \nAs she led us through the forest of silk trees and flowers to our table, we admired her classicly tacky floral uniform and shimmery tights. I've never been more jealous of a working environment. The menu was large and filled with a huge assortment of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.. always being served.\nI called my brother in law for \"must-haves\" and was told to get the Bloody Mary, among other specialties. I went ahead and ordered my Tower of Bloody Mary and it was amazing. I'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy, so we ordered that.. along with the Fantasia waffle. A belgian waffle covered in fresh fruit, blueberry syrup and choice of whipped cream or sour cream. We ate until we thought we would explode, but the fun didn't end there.\nRumors of the breathtaking \"Fireside Lounge\" and it's famous fire pit drew us to it's glory. If I thought the neon goodness was only in the restaurant, I was extremely mistaken. Take all the yummy neon lights, then dim the rest of the lights, add some pink couches and cocktail waitresses in gowns and full make-up (no matter the time of day).. you have yourself the Fireside Lounge. Oh wait! It gets better... The FIRE PIT!! I've never seen anything so amazing. Imagine a tiny jacuzzi with fire coming out of it and the vent lined with little TV's showing the hottest sporting event. Nothing short of fantastic. We sunk into a spot around the fire and it took Superman's will power to get us up and out of there. \nDo yourself a favor. Go to the Peppermill. If not for the decor, do it for the food. Yummy!"

Definitely an interesting crowd.  It's more of a date spot, so if you are looking to meet people (other than prostitutes) you may want to think twice before coming here.\n\nThe bartender looked irritated and wasn't friendly and I don't understand the long gowns they make the poor cocktail waitresses wear.  Drinks are a little overpriced considering this really isn't a part of the Strip where tourists hang out.  A beer and a vodka cranberry cost $13.\n\nI have to mention that the floor was FILTHY.  It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in about two weeks.  Bleh.\n\nThe Fireside Lounge is a place that is trying to cling to its '70's heyday and I like it.  Vegas needs more old-school.

BUT I have to say I was really surprised by this place. Such a funky, cool Vegas spot. Yes all the other reviews are right. Very Kitsch and lots of neon and mirrors and the fireplace in the middle of the restaurant is pretty cool. TIP: when you walk in you have to go to the bar/lounge area to the left for this stuff. There is a main eating room/diner area to the right when you walk in. GO LEFT to the lounge. You can still get great diner food and big drinks in there.  I did feel like the place could have been a strip club at some point. I kept looking to see if there was some remnant of a stripper pole in there somewhere but couldn't find it. Never researched the history on this joint so who knows? Anyway, I love finding weird fun and funky spots outside of \"The Strip\" and this one definitely one to visit."

Tacky 50's diner feel with a 70's disco themed decor it's lemme say.....quite \"interesting to the eye\" (haha).  Anyways despite the shocking decor upon walking in we were kindly greeted and taken to our booth. We were promptly brought waters and menu's. I ordered the egg white veggie omelette. It was great, the eggs were fluffy the veggies were sauteed and it wasn't greasy at all! As if the omelette wasn't enough it also came with homefries, fresh fruit and toast. My friends all ordered some different variations of omelettes all which looked great and they said tasted even better. All in all experience was good, food reliable, and servers were all very nice and helpful when asking them questions about different things to do around the city."

            "review": "This review is for the lounge only as we'd already had dinner and came here for the dive bar ambiance and drinks.\n\nFrom what I could tell, the lounge is to the left, restaurant to the right. Inside the lounge/bar area, it's dimly lit with couches sprawled around all over, and small fires burning in central areas (usually with couches encircling them). As most of the fire areas were occupied, we found a small section and sat down. The menu had an interesting list of drinks and we each picked out something when the waitress came by to take our order. I chose a weird \"cream cheese icing\" drink just for the hell of it.\n\nOur drinks came out and I was presented with a martini glass rimmed with graham cracker crumbs and this eye-crossingly sweet icing flavoured drink. Seriously, if you're not a fan of sweet drinks, don't get this. I love sweet drinks and it was delicious but it pretty much made me done with drinking afterwards! \n\nWe had a small incident that resulted in my drink on the floor (and on my pants) and the waitress who saw it came over and cleaned it up, while we apologized and asked for a second one to replace it. She brought it over and even though the spill was our fault and we expected to pay for it, she never charged us for it! Hooray! (we did leave an appropriate tip to show our gratitude!)\n\nThe bar itself isn't too loud and rowdy (we were there between 11:30 pm and 12:30 am, give or take). TVs scattered around up on ceiling were playing videos of live performances of a range of music, mostly 70s and 80s rock, which was pretty neat to watch.\n\nSadly, we didn't stay, just long enough for the one drink. As we had just flown in that day, we both had a sudden crash and wanted to just to find our hotel and rest up. We had planned on staying for a few rounds of drinks but unfortunately did cut it short. This place is on our list to return to though next time we're in the area, as the dive bar atmosphere was pretty awesome and the service was top."

We were there for dinner and, although seated immediately, were there for nearly two hours.  The server grabbed a box for me to take the remainder of my food home in, but didn't think to grab the check at the same time?

            "review": "Two cliches apply to the Peppermill: everything you've heard is true, and words can't describe it.\n\nThere's no way to fully descibe the decor of the restaurant & lounge. It's kind of a retro-futuristic 50s/80s neon hybrid. The pink is bubblegum hot, the blue is sky electric, the mirrored tiling and faux greenery add to the surreal atmosphere. Recently several huge monitors were added to the entry/waiting area, and a widescreen travelogue of tableaus from around the world plays on them. A new one pops up every few minutes. Times Square, then Tokyo, then whitewater rapids. It's like a postmodern vacation.\n\nThe lounge is built around a circular flame pool, but there is also grouped seating available. The bar offers traditional seating. Be warned, the cocktails pictured on the cocktail menu are as large as they look. Pace yourself!\n\nThe restaurant is mainly diner-style booths for seating, with counter service available if you'd like to get a look at what's going on in the kitchen. Here even the menu is huge. I can recommend the Old-Fashioned Belgian Waffle, the Western Fruit Plate, the hamburgers, and the Nachos Nachos Nachos. This is also the kind of restaurant where sometimes just dessert is enough: recently a friend ordered a sundae thinking she would get something simple and ended up with a dish almost as big as her head.\n\nThe prices look a little spendy, but when measured against portion size, they're a geat value for a Strip experience like this. Go, and be prepared to be tempted to buy a bag of pink & blue sparkly table sugar as a souvenir."

Over the decades, bits and pieces of stand alones (stores, cafes, smaller casinos) have been plucked from the ground like weeds. I think it is a good thing for Vegas's economy but I also feel that something should be preserved, maybe that's why I have always liked this place.  I have a fondness for Peppermill because it is as old as I am, we were both born in 1972. \n\nOn my most recent visit, I bought a friend for brunch before I ran him to the airport. As soon as we were seated he mentioned that it reminded him of diners in Jersey where he grew up. I felt I made an excellent choice because nostalgia is always a good thing! We decided to split the enormous pancakes and Joe's San Francisco Special. We also ordered coffees and of course this cocktail darling couldn't resist one of their glorious Bloody Mary's! \n\nThe portions are huge so it may be a good idea to split it or know you will have breakfast food leftovers for awhile! The Joe's SF Special was like a huge platter of \"stuff\"... Eggs, ground beef, sausage, spinach, Potato, cheese all together. It was pretty awesome and comforting. The pancakes are huge! When the serving platter was placed on the table my friend exclaimed \"What's this?\". Uh those are pancakes my friend. I really want to meet the spatula that flips those pancakes. Do they use two arms to flip it? I'm pondering but need to finish up here. The Bloody Mary! Get one. They are beautiful and yummy, especially needed for a Vegas brunch!"

The employees wear weird costumes that I don't quite understand. The waitresses dress in blue and white overall/romper get-ups and the bartenders wear ball gowns....it's just unexplainable. But the service itself was sort of slow. It seemed as if there were more employees on the clock than actual customers. \n\nThe do have a guy who comes around and takes photos to capture your dining experience. It's sort of like Buca di Beppo and you get a complimentary photo with your meal. The photographer did inform us he wasn't with the restaurant and worked off commission so it was kind of awkward not buying the photo....\n\nBut as far as the food, it's mostly breakfast options, the portions are large, and it's relatively inexpensive.  I had the Crab Cake Bene (poached eggs and grilled crab cakes on toasted English muffins, smothered in Hollandaise sauce) and I opted for the Hollandaise sauce on the side rightfully so because it was REALLY thick and salty. The crab cakes were already heavily salted down so it really didn't need to be lathered, smothered or bathed in any salt. \n\nThis place has a decent location, decent price; ok food, LARGE portions, sort of outdated and gimmicky but possess a charm none-the-less. I wouldn't suggest the Crab Cake Bene nor any of their other lunch items but they do serve Breakfast all day 24hrs so it seems like a great drunk place to visit. Other than that its mehhhh"

It was busy, and there was a wait, so we went into the fireside lounge. What a cool, hip, old-school Vegas setting! The Bloody Mary was the best I have ever tasted (I normally don't like them, but this one was awesome). The reviews that my husband  saw suggested ordering one, so we did (and two more). The food was amazing with enormous portions, so beware. For Vegas, the prices are reasonable, and we had excellent service in both the bar and restaurant. We will make it a point to go back to this place on our future trips to Vegas. The only negative is that it is down next to the Riviera, and walking in that area is a little shady.

I'd heard about it forever, but finally went after a performance of La Cage aux Folles at the Smith Center ran a lot longer than we expected.  It was late, we were very hungry, and I figured they'd be open.\n\nI was unprepared for all the neon.  But I LOVE neon, so this place had my kind of vibe.  It took a long time to slog through the big menu, but as we were looking I was also noticing the size of the portions passing by, so we decided to share an omelet, with hash browns and a toasted bagel.\n\nThe omelet was gargantuan, and when I asked our waitress how many eggs it had, she said \"about 10.\"  That meant four eggs for me, since I always make sure hubby has a bigger portion.  That's usually my quota for six months.  I've never been a big fan of home fries, but these were the bomb;  I just couldn't stop eating them.  My only nit was the bagel, which was barely toasted, but I think even more toasting couldn't have saved it.  You can't pass off this thing with a whole to a New Yorker and really get away with it.  It looked like a bagel, but didn't quack like one.\n\nWe didn't have drinks, but had a good time looking at the mammoth drink being shared at the table next to us.  Next time we will indulge, either in the restaurant, or in the lounge, which I made sure to check out before we left.  Spectacular!, and I can't wait to try it.\n\nThis all took place the night before I was to leave for Jersey for an extended period.  The next night, friends were arriving from the East Coast, and where did hubby take them?  You guessed righ.  And that couple liked it so much that all three of them went back the next night, too.   With all that food, I hope I'll recognize my husband by the time I get back!\n\nPeppermill is the closest thing to our beloved East Coast Greek diners, but in true Vegas style, glitzier, bigger, brighter, and over the top.  In a good way."

Since this place is open 24 hours a day, you see an interesting cross section of America.\n\nTip: Make sure to go in the back room and check out the fire pits and love seats. For guys, I recommend going between 4A-6A, the girls that work at some of hottest Vegas night time places are going home and stop in to eat before they go home."

I agreed we should try this spot so I didn't eat much all day so I could indulge a bit with a breakfast at 2am. As we showed at 2am, a little tipsy I may add, we all head to the RR to wash up I ask if I should put our name down for a table? My buddy looked at me a little confused and replied,\" They have a f'n restaurant? Were here for the lounge.\" To this my reply was,\" They have a f'n lounge? I was here for the food.\" Turns out we caught to different shows featuring to different sides of this joint.\n\nAs we enter the lounge we were set back by the d\u00e9cor that seem not to have been updated from the mid 80's, but it worked. The environment had a certain level of comfort that you don't get in a big hotel lounge. Great group seating, this spot even had a fire pit indoors. None of the music was dated I say past 87' but as I said it worked. A mix of locals getting off work and tourist coming and going we ended up drinking and eating for about another 3-4hrs. Our waitress was beautiful to the point we were willing to take each out to spend sometime with her, it was great. \n\nThis is definitely the spot to hit if you want away from the Vegas norm."

First off the hostess and wait staff were friendly and helpful.  Our waitress answered all our questions about drinks and when one of the couples with us ordered the large nachos she recommended the small and boy am I glad she did because the small could easily feed 4-6.  The drinks were well priced and made well.  I opted for the Bloody Mary while the BF got The Scorpion (as seen on TV) - both were mighty tasty.  Our group not only had the nachos but also the BBQ sliders, ribs and the app sampler.  All were made really quick and tasted good.  There was even a photographer who came around and took group pics of us (free of charge).  We showed up around 4pm on a Friday and though the fireside table was reserved at 7pm the waitress politely notified us but didn't pressure us to leave or even move (which we did when more of our party showed up around 6:30pm).  All in all I give this place 5 stars and will be going back next time I'm in Vegas!"

Tatu from Fantasy Island is pointing at the disco ball saying.. De plane.. de plane!\n\nI can only imagine those days. \n\nThe food here is average fare. It's all about quantity here with average quality. Breakfast is served all day. Go ahead and be a kid and eat pancakes for dinner.\nThe pancakes here are huge. They're bigger than your face big! The quality, however, is sub par. It's too starchy. I prefer IHOP compared to the pancakes here. We also shared corned beef hash, poached eggs, (gave away my tomato to Coco), and a side of toast.

Oh my, what a trip.\n\nWe drove up to this restaurant down toward the older part of the strip around 11:20AM on a Saturday  morning; there were people waiting outside.  We decided to try it anyway & went inside the where the hostess took our name for a 35 minute wait.  We went to check out the lounge - you MUST check out the lounge.\n\nTacky might be a good adjective but fun tacky like a walk back into the 70s.  Neon lights, mirrors and silk/plastic florals & greenery throughout the darkened room illuminated with multiple tvs playing music videos from days past; seating is in semi-circular pit arrangements.  The bar was full with some patrons playing video poker while others just took in the scene.  The focal point of the lounge, however, is the step down fire pit with the flame glowing in the middle of a pool of water.  There was a guest of honor from a bachelorette party interestingly clad with various monetary units & mints hanging from her ensemble hamming it up two couples who wandered in with their 70's garb and took multiple \"what happens in Vegas stays...\" photos.  It was a free show!  Oh, the drinks were fine - my bloody Mary was a bit pricey but it did come in a hurricane glass (remember those?)\n\nWhen our name was called for brunch - we were seated at a window booth (all booth seating).  The floral motif continued and was accompanied by tiffany style lighting.  We saw omelets the size of your head go by - and the line outside continued.  Since it was the noon hour by this time we chose to order sliders & pesto chicken sandwich from our waitress wearing a carhop type of getup (short skirt).  Both food orders were really good and accompanied by a copious pile of fries. \n\nPeppermill seems to be a local favorite but many taxis came through too.  The after noon timeframe brought in a younger set of patrons - the line had gotten a bit shorter but it would no doubt get longer as the late night crowd woke from their night of partying.  It's on our list for a return visit."

We looked over and saw a HUGE cockroach (approx 2 inches long) crawling across the seat of the booth. The manager quickly ushered those people out of the restaurant. I also asked to speak to the manager since we had just started eating and the manager was immediately defensive saying things like \"It didnt touch you\" & \"we're in Nevada, you know how it is\". During this time a few employees stood there, looked at the roach crawling around and walked away. Not one person cared enough to kill it or to apologize to those of us who saw it. The manager had no interest in hearing what I had to say or in trying to make the situation 'right', and actually told me \"You're not coming back here again anyway, so why should I bother to do anything\". SERIOUSLY?. Needless to say, our appetites were ruined, we sent the remainder (over 1/2 of each plate) of our food back and got stuck with a $55 bill. We should have walked out like the table on the other side of us."

From the super awkward, host who seemed to be on something to the super adorable busser, David we had a blast even before our food came. I ordered the chicken fried steak which was great but too heavy to eat in 100 degree weather, and my friend ordered the sirloin with the garlic mushrooms. I thought she messed up for a minute, I would never ever order steak in a diner but it was amazing! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, I was green with\nfood envy. Then it got real interesting, an older couple was sat in the booth in front of us, and the gentlemen was dressed kinda like a thug. Aka thug nasty... was the highlight of our trip. A year later we still talk and laugh about him like we know him, if anyone does know him can you tell him I'm looking for him?! I just want him to be real with us."

In the diner there are huge artificial cherry blossom trees all over the place. The decor is like nothing I ever saw before. The food is excellent, too. At least what we had was good. We had breakfast. My husband got the pancakes and they were three enormous cakes that even he couldn't finish. (He ate the three pound Big Daddy Luke burger - but that's another review!) I had the french toast collage and it was yummy, too. The Collage is bacon, eggs, and french toast. \n\nWe took a cab here. I don't think it is the best neighborhood to go wandering around.

There's plenty of counter \"diner style\" seating if you're on your own or a couple, though, so walking in might work.

Nothing like getti g up at 5 PM after a long night on the craps tables and being able to get your pancakes and eggs.\n\nLarge.... nay, gigantic, portions on many items.  Nachoes are at least 4 people, fruit plate is easily big enough for 3-4, etc.  Hefty burgers, big bowls of soup and generous portions of fish on the fish and chips (watch this dish, if the grease is a little old in the fryer it might not be the best).  Definately a handy spot even if it IS on the far end of the strip."

Big portions of diner-style food are the main attraction, and a skilled group of servers deliver well prepared food with a smile.\n\nOmelets are huge.  This ain't Denny's or IHOP.  And they're delicious, too.\n\nSandwiches are all huge.  The burgers are best eaten with a fork, as they are big, piled high with your choice of tasty toppings.  The Focaccia Chicken sandwich is gargantuan with juicy chicken breast, avocado, prosciutto, and melted provolone cheese.  I dare you to eat the whole thing.  \n\nFor me the star attraction at Peppermill is the Onion Rings.  I started my cooking career at Howard Johnson's decades ago, and besides being a great place to get ice cream HoJo's made a few things very well that brought customers back.  Onion rings were thickly hand-sliced then dipped in condensed milk, then battered, dipped in condensed milk a second time, then battered again before deep frying.  The results were amazing, and Peppermill's got a good process, too, as their O-Rings brought me right back to HoJo's kitchen in Maple Shade, NJ.\n\nPrices are not cheap, though they are not casino-expensive either.  Any way you look at it, you'll find lots of yummy food, served by good people and fair prices.\n\nIf you're at the Convention Center take the walk or pay the cab fare.  Considering the food there you'll thank me later, fellow Yelper."

I knew from the minute I walked in the door that I liked this place!  Funky decor, neon lighting, big fake trees throughout the restaurant, and the wonderful Fireside Lounge.  This has got to be the best diner in Las Vegas, and the setting is unforgettable.\n\nIn the lounge, the video poker machines at the bar are fun, but the seats around the water feature and fire are the best!  Last time I was in, I saw Brooke (Punkin) from Charm School.  She was having fun with some guys and kept getting approached by fans.  We left her alone.\n\nThe food is very good, as far as fried stuff and diner food is concerned.  Don't expect a healthy meal here.  The service is quick and friendly and the price is fair.  If you like the Peppermill in Vegas, the good news is that they have an entire casino and resort in Reno under the same name that takes the crazy design to a completely different level."

We paid $20 to get there, because we take uber, and paid $30 for food, mind you we only got a philly and fruit. With that being said we are not in the best shape with money so having spent $50 for the worst service, was not okay. We rarely go on dates so it was really frustrating that all this happened. But even then we still paid for our meal. We get there and after waiting 15 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us, when she did all she said was \"are you guys ready to order\". I am a server and am very easy to please, because I am a server I am way more lenient about things then others. But this experience was unacceptable. After the long wait when we finally got our food *which was good* we asked for ranch and when we did she said \" I know I'm getting it \" in a very rude way and also never smiled. Then it took her about 8 minutes to get a little side of ranch. By then my boyfriend had maybe 2 bites left. The table in front of us had asked for a lemonade 5x in total and didn't even get that. They not only had to ask the busser who blew them off and continued setting up silverware but also another server who still didn't bring the lemonade by then they were extremely upset and left. so we definitely were not the only unhappy people. Very disappointed because I was so excited for this date. Will not be returning unless things change."

Over the years, many celebrities have frequented the location, including Elvis.  I'm glad that I've visited this place more than once.  \n\nTo be honest, though, the look of the place is drab and not really upscale.  The lounge looks like an 80's porn star man cave.  Full of mirrors, blue and purple low dim lighting, a fire pit in the middle of the lounge.  Thank goodness it's a historic location of Las Vegas.  \n\nMy drinks were about $5-$10, including beer and vodka sodas.  For the appetizers, we got a crap load.  I'll just list them and give a little bit of my opinion:\n\n-Shrimp Cocktail for $12.95:  Nothing glamorous, cocktail sauce is tangy, lots of shrimp given.\n\n-Chicken Quesadillas for $11.50:  served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  Your standard quesadilla, again nothing stand out!\n\n-Chicken Nachos for $16.25:  Lots of items.  This was a huge plate but the cheese hardened quickly.  Sides included jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and black olives.\n\n-Bruschetta for $8.25:  tomatoes, basil, garlic, onions, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese, served on toasted herb focaccia bread.  This was actually flavorful and moist.  One of my favorites!\n\n-Chicken fingers for $10.25:  Your standard pub fingers.  Kind of dry.\n\n-Caprese salad for $8.95:  Sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil.  The slices were thick and grouped together, it was delicious!\n\nI know I'm missing some of the items but we literally got a few of each of these plates.  Our group was pretty big!  At the end of the day, it was your standard pub food.  Nothing that really blew me away.  I would go back because of the status of this historic icon."

The Hamburgers have perfectly cooked Angus beef on a golden grilled bun. The fries have that impossible to find crunchy outside & tender inside, every single one of them.   The Pastrami is tender, juicy, and plentiful and served on buttery grilled rye bread.  Be sure to order the \"Scorpion\" drink for a whole new twist on \"Burger & Shake\".  I wasn't expecting the \"King of The Hill\" of Diners but after 20 years of trips to Vegas,  this  was a long overdue & fortuitous find."

You can get full bar served to your table as well. My faves are the omelets, and they have the best bagels and cream cheese! Big salads and big burgers and hot food also. GREAT pasta meals. then once you are done eating retire to the bar and try to get a seat next to the fire pit. you will see some interesting people mozy through there.

It's a lively atmosphere with music videos on the TVs. Without a doubt, the vibe of the place was the biggest appeal to me here. I tried one of their benedicts, and the flavor had me charging through my meal (it can be said in my defense that I was very hungry that night). Again, I sampled their Bloody Mary, and that was \"Yes\" and \"Please\".\n\nI did not, however, sample their Fireside Lounge this outing, but I did go in to check it out. I love their fire pit. It's really impressive, and now I have to find an excuse to go dress up and experience it proper.\n\nThis is a classic restaurant. My only regret is not visiting it sooner now that I've been able to experience its food and appeal. While I have grumbled in the past that Vegas doesn't respect its history, I hope they have the smarts to leave this landmark location alone, and let it continue to do its thing.\n\nI can see this becoming one of my new favorites."

We were headed to the Cowboy Christmas at the Convention Center, but ended up enjoy ourselves more at breakfast with your entire restaurant standing room only all the way outside to Las Vegas Boulevard. You must have been the most popular restaurant in town today.

OK, AND ON TOP OF THAT - they charge you for EVERY REFILL.  EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.  I was even charged for a whole other cup of coffee when I just asked to top off my cup to make the coffee hot again. So, what... ? They put in less then a 1/4 of a pour and charge me for a whole cup of coffee?  I don't think so. I have no desire to go back there again.  But...\n\nThe Lounge - cool vibe, the food seems to be better when it served back there (still can't figure that out) and the drinks are REALLY REALLY good.

No flavor what so ever. The baked potato was even bad. It was over cooked and damp tasting like it had been sitting in a steam oven all day.

I was in the lounge the week before and I had to go back to the restaurant part.\n\nI've been on a mission this particular week, looking for people I worked with. \n\nThe food is incredible, you can see by the pics. Everything IS over the top, but it was already that way if it makes sense. Restaurants now try to make everything over the top with what I call Epic Menu. It's already been spoofed online and in tv. You have millions of \"mash up\" options can get combos that don't make sense just to be creative (i.e. burger taco?). Restaurant developers have gone crazy from all the cooking shows on tv trying to come up with new trends. But here, they just have many... accessories? To things that make sense that you don't get at the national corporate graveyard restaurants. \n\nSomething happened/s at this bar (meaning counter service, not the lounge, just went over this!) that I haven't encountered at any restaurant I've ever been to. The portions are so huge, if you go by yourself, you will have leftovers. That's given. \n\nSo, I have been to the counter by myself before. This is probably the only restaurant I regret going to by myself because I always enjoy going with a committee of people, we always wind up sharing and sampling each other's food. And that's because the 32 volume leather bound menu can give you an indecisive aneurism when ordering. \n\nOne of the first times I ate here was with a group of Goths I started hanging out with. There was one who decided to go to the empty booth next to us and push her breasts against the window. And while everyone was stupid enough to not take a picture of this (this was back when we still could have put it on myspace), the memory of it struggles and blurs every time I try to rethink of it. I just remember black and lace and... volume. I did go on to date her after months of hanging out \"as friends.\" and it was damn worth it. I have to mention the best off the menu special I ever got here, amirite? \n\nSo, at the counter, hungover one night by myself, I had a bunch of leftovers and I seriously doubted it would make the long journey home. I was walking since my motorcycle was possibly at Sahara, or Stratosphere, that kind of night. A couple of seats down this cute couple of girls were also finishing their meals with 2/3's left over as well. They asked me if I wanted to scoot over and help them finish. And then we ate our meals, hey-ooo! See what I did there? They were on vacation and their next trip, we got together again. You probably know I love Peppermill, right? \n\nThere was one more story I wanted to tell, but you get the idea of how great this place is. We went here the night they imploded Stardust. I'll have to figure out where I can continue that story unless I want to do a clearly obsolete review of Stardust? the only place more over the top than the Peppermill is the Peppermill CASINO in Reno. My best attempts would underdescribe that LSD farm."

We stayed at the Riviera and we always saw this 24-hour restaurant with a huge crowd.  It reminded me of the Denny's in my local town.  I read some of the reviews on yelp and we made our way here before the drive home.\n\nGreat breakfast! I had Joe's San Francisco Special.  It's a fat omelet with onions, potatoes, cheese, spinach, and lots of meat.  You get one side which is a choice of toast, blueberry muffin, or a bran muffin.  I chose the blueberry muffin.  It was fresh from the oven and tasted delicious!  The prices are not bad and the food is great.  I'll definitely want to try their lunch and dinner."

The restaurant was crowded but there wasn't a wait to get a table. Ordering drinks took forever because the waitress had to get a separate \"cocktail waitress\" to take our alcoholic drink order. One of our friends joked she wouldn't order a steak based on what she saw walking to our table. The price for a steak dinner ranged from $26 to $29. I commented back to her for that price how could the steaks be bad. Boy was I wrong. I order a New York steak and shrimp dinner for $29. The steak was the size you would get for a $9.99 steak and eggs breakfast. To say this was over priced is an understatement. I know size isn't everything but this steak didn't even taste good. The other dinners (chicken nachos and a fresh fruit platter)  were no better.  If that wasn't bad enough our cocktails were of the premixed straight from the fountain gun dispenser type. Needless to say no one finished their food or drinks. What a waste of money. As for the maitre d' I wonder if he gets some sort of kick back for sending people to this place. So much for asking a local where to eat."

While you wait for your seat, you can play at the slot machines or visit the fireside lounge where you can see the fireplace!\n\nThe waiters are friendly, the sugar is fun and colorful, but the food does take a while to come out. But when they do, the portions are quite large!\n\nThe New York steak and eggs was ordered at medium rare, but It came out medium. Juicy and tender enough, with pepper sprinkled on top. It comes with a choice of bread, where you can choose muffin or toast. The blueberry muffin was very moist, soft and delicious with some sugar on top.\n\nThe turkey dinner (seasonal) was actually very good. It wasn't dry at all. Came with a side of stuffing, cranberry jam, mash potatoes with gravy a dinner roll and some veggies.\n\nWe also ordered the Soup salad and bread. The chicken soup tasted fresh but the salad wasn't very fresh, some of the leafs were already starting to brown. You are given the choice of Garlic bread or Rosemary. We went with the garlic bread, and I was happy to see that it had cheese on it.\n\nThe Ciabatta pesto burger, was ordered medium but came out well done. Had it been cooked correctly it would have tasted pretty good. Ordered with a side of Onion rings which were on point!\n\nIf you're very hungry or looking for something to eat at odd hours, this restaurant will definitely satiate your appetite! But if you're searching for quality, I recommend going elsewhere!"

Looked at the menu, tried to decide on some real diner food. No grilled cheese on the menu?  No tomato soup?

There is plastic bougainvillea everywhere, creating little oases of privacy, despite the mirrored ceilings.  Purple, pink, and turquoise lights add to the \"ambiance.\"  Nothing about this place is real.  It's Vegas, after all.  Get out of the hot Vegas sun and soak up some fireside kitsch.

It is not as upscale and modern as places in the Bellagio or elsewhere, but we were not expecting it to be. I was delighted with the decor and found it very comfy, cozy, intimate and fun. The AAA travel book said they the waitresses would \"treat you like big shots\" but they did not, and that was OK too. But our waitress was prompt and friendly. They have some really cool huge drinks, and we saw a HUGE plate of nachos on the table next to us. We ordered some appetizers and they weren't gourmet or anything but they were fine. Prices are better than most lounges we've been to on the strip. We sat in a cozy corner but next time I'd like to sit by the fireplace.\n\nThen we went to the Peppermill Restaurant on Thanksgiving Day. We were well aware that this holiday dinner was not all-you-can-eat and that was perfectly fine with us. We made reservations but there were plenty of available tables. We also told our waitress we would take advantage of their senior citizen discount on the Thanksgiving Dinner. I ordered the key lime martini which was fabulous. Love that the rim of the glass is covered in graham cracker crumbs. The Thanksgiving dinner was excellent and was as tasty as a good homemade Thanksgiving feast. We had driven across country and loved that everything tasted homemade.  It exceeded our expectations. Our waitress went off shift and another came to take care of us the rest of the meal.\n\nNow here comes the problem and why I only gave a 4 star rating. When we went to pay, the cashier snapped at us that there was no discount on the Thanksgiving dinner. So I promptly picked up the little Thanksgiving dinner flyer on the hostess desk behind me and showed her that it was in writing about the senior discount. Well, then she huffed, \"you're supposed to tell your waitress when you are seated.\" We told the cashier that we did tell our waitress we wanted the senior discount but we had a change of waitresses during our meal. So then she had to leave the cash register to confer with our waitress and manager or whoever and came back and took our money. No \"thank you for dining with us\" or \"have a nice holiday\" or anything. Nothing. Just a pissy attitude. Here we had had a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and then had to battle this old bitty. Because it was a holiday and I didn't want to ruin my husband's day, I didn't argue with her over her bad attitude or ask for the manager. Had I pushed the issue, we probably could have gotten a comp or something for her being so rude. We left. \n\nI would go back to the Fireside in a heartbeat, but probably not the Peppermill. They lost our business and that is too bad because we love the Fireside. I just don't want to risk a bad experience there again with another employee."

Waffle - Huge portion with butter on top.  Nothing special.  Just a waffle.\n2. French Toast - 6 slices of toast.  nothing spectacular\n3. Veggie Omelet - The ingredients were great but the omlet itself did not hold up well meaning they added to much liquid (water, milk...i dunno what it was)\n\nOverall, the food isnt very expensive but the portions are huge.  It did lack a lot of flavor but it wasn't horrible.  It would be hard for me to recommend this place for food.  \n\nI would recommend the lounge.  It was actually pretty nice but weird at the same time.  Diner on 1 side and a sexy hot lounge on the other."

Cool exterior, we were pumped and ready to eat!  service was efficient.  Most of us got breakfast, and only one got a sandwich.  All the breakfast food (hashbrowns, omelettes, chicken friend steak) was just blah blah blah.  Sure, larger portions, but NOTHING was amazing or above average.  I can't stress enough how BELOW average their food was.  Not worth the wait.  Not worth the energy.  Staff even got mad for two of our group smoking in the \"fire lane\" -- they were standing NOT in a car.  WEIRD.  where are you supposed to smoke during a 30 minute wait?  will never be back.  why is this place soooooo popular I'll never understand."

But if you have a hearty appetite or have a car full of linebackers or truckers they will appreciate the portion size.  \n\nSadly my order wasn't great. My omelet with spinach was the consistency of sponge cake-yucky.  Our waitress forgot to get us water.

I tried the Southern Fried Steak and it hit the spot. Ample portion, but the taste was not compromised. I got it with hash browns and over medium eggs. The hash browns were crispy and the eggs were cooked properly. Both were good. Now onto the main event. The Southern Fried Steak had an acceptable amount of breading and \"healthy\" portion of beef rounds. Seasoning came through with the savory, yet not overly heavy, gravy sauce. I especially liked the hints of mushroom. This is a must try dish! \n\nOthers ordered the Veggie Omelette, Pork Loin with Eggs, and Crab Cakes. All said their food was good. They appreciated the value-based portions. Looks like most dishes are safe bets here.\n\nService was relatively prompt and friendly considering it was busy.

To be honest I was not very happy. Once I got over not getting what I expected we had a really good time. The food was great, the wait staff was on point, and the atmosphere was super fun. I have been several times since. I went last weekend and I had the same experience as usual. The waitresses are incredibly sweet.

You really can't miss it with the big neon blue and pink sign. I feel like it's just a classic place. I mean my mom used to work there back in her day, its been in movies, and it still packed on the weekend. Peppermill is a unique place. It has been a while since I walked into a bar and was just in awe. I know it's an older place and it could use some updating but fuck it, this place is cool. \nYou have two parts, the lounge and the restaurant. My friend made reservation for the lounge for his and my best friends birthday for 20 people or so. We walked in on Saturday around 8pm and got to our table and started to order drinks. I love their drink menu. The have some basic drinks and then some ice cream items and even the scorpion. This night I was the DD so I could only taste a little bit of everything. Everyone got something a little different. Alabama slammer, grasshopper, creamsicle, and mudslide to name a few. Everyone had a blast and their happy hour is awesome. They have 50% off well drinks, house wines, and domestic beers. Also their beer are in a bottle. We found that out when we ordered Irish car bombs. No biggie tho. \nInside the lounge they have a fire pit surrounded by water. Every time I walked by the seats were all taken and there was a lot of canoodling. The decor reminded us of poison ivy's lair with all the leaves and plants and also a strip club. They also have TVs playing different concerts. It was interesting because music was playing but we could hear each other. We had a large area and a lot of people but we could all hear each other. We didn't have to yell across the table or yell in someones ear. Peppermill was a blast from the past and I want to go back."

            "review": "Passed by this place many times but never bothered to stop by.. Until, we did a \"nearby\" search on my Yelp App... Mann, have I been missin' out for the last few years!! \n\nFirst off, the atmosphere/decor is definitely out of the ordinary and most likely inspired from a nightclub/strip club.. Disco ball glass, Cherry Blossom Trees and Neon Lights.. Interesting and totally Vegas!\n\nWhat will make me come back again and again:\n\nSouthern Fried Steak: This was the Best Chicken Fried Steak I've ever had! Crispy, Crispy Chicken Breading, Good Thickness, Tender and So Flavorful!! The gravy was Great and just made it even better! It came with Some of the Best Hash Browns I've ever had!! Yes, this plate was a Double Whammy!! The Hash had the typical string/shredded potatoes but wider cuts and an amplified potato flavor!! The eggs, I tried their scrambled eggs and they were tastier than average and fluffier than normal. Plus, I opted with a side of White Toast. The Toast was ordinary but it came with a delicious strawberry jam. To Top it off, this entree could easily feed two starving people!!! \n\nFrench Toast: Another Generous Dish that came with 6 Fat 1/2Slices of Texas Toast that were Frenched up Correctly! Nice soft butter and maple syrup (not too thick) just brought it home! Traditional and Executed Right! \n\nMarinated Pork Chops: Came with 2 bone-in cuts, grilled with the nice evident checker marks and lightly seasoned with herbs and spices. Not bad but Nothing compared to the Southern/Chicken Fried Steak. This also came with a small slices of apples and sauce. The side of Hash Browns.. You know how I feel about those! This time, I went with egg whites and a bagel with cream cheese for the included choice of sides. Egg whites were Great (similar to the scrambled eggs) and the Bagel was massive and Satisfying (No, Einstein Bagel but it did the job).\n\nDined here twice now, within a week and this place isn't around the block.. Hint, Hint.. Service both times were Flawless.. Veteran Servers: know what to say, how to say it and when to say it.. Fast service, follow-ups.. I like the Feel and Atmosphere, much different the norm. Prices are alright, they pile on the food and quality is there. I'm hooked on their Southern Fried Steak and Eggs!!! and  Hash Browns!"

Service: Well Mihaela the Russian girl,  best thing this joint has going for them. Without her I'd have probably given a star or two less. So let's say service is average. Ambiance: below average. It feels like you are in some 70s themed, third world movie scene. This restaurant is not fit to be on the strip, half  mile away from encore. A good suggestion in my opinion would be to blow it up along with the next door Riviera."

Decently priced considering how expensive most restaurants are around these parts - looking around at other dishes -- portions are massive. Open 24hrs is ideal for soaking up the booze consumed on the strip. Lounge area continues the vibe with a center piece fire on the water. Cocktails are good - bartenders didn't mind the few suggestive tweaks I asked for. Staff was friendly, accommodating, and quite easy on the eyes. Good spot for a solid meal and funky ambiance."

Then after reading the reviews on here I knew I absolutely had to go since I prefer places with..hmm..lets call it  \"character\".\n\nCheesy. Check. A little tacky. Check. Absolutely wonderful. I think so.  I made the lounge my first stop after arriving in Vegas at 2am. I was surrounded by fake plastic trees and hot pink rope lights. I sat where I could overlook the fire pit and was served by a waitress in an evening gown. She and I bonded over making fun of the guy I was with as he asked a billion questions about martinis and I, the chick, just ordered a beer. The alcohol prices, I would soon learn, are pretty much on par with most places in Vegas. They did however have pretty good booze specials that started at either 3 or 4 am ( I cant remember exactly) and ran for a couple hours. I also opted to feast on some nachos.  One order was more than enough for 2 people. Oh, and I know this may not be important to all but I was very impressed that the nachos were clearly layered. By this I mean Chips then cheese then chips then cheese etc.  Not just cheese on the very top of the chips. What can I say? Little things impress the hell out of me. In conclusion, it was a great start to my first trip to Vegas. Oh, Peppermill I will be seeing you again soon."

Pretty standard cafe food. The portions are enormous so I often suggest sharing as an option. \n\nOn this particular occasion I came just to sit with some friends and have a few drinks after work in the Fireside Lounge. This was actually my first time in that area of the restaurant. On previous trips I've usually had my fair share of drinks by the time I happened upon the restaurant. The lounge is actually really cool. It wasn't too busy and there were lots of cushy sofas to sit on around cool looking firepits. \n\nI ordered a diet soda (because I'm trying to be good on weekdays), but sampled some of my friend's Pineapple Upside Down martini, which was delicious! I look forward to another trip to this lounge for food and drinks."

Does that question even need to be asked?\n\nI've never, ever had a bad experience there, in the many times I've been there over the past 15 years. It's amazing how little the place changes - maybe the management could update the waitstaff's cocktail-waitress-type attire from the Hawaiian nightmare it is now (and always has been), but that's about it. Service is sometimes slower when they get slammed (and they do get very slammed at times) but since I rarely get to bed before 2am when in Vegas, the crowd has usually dissipated by the time I roll in for breakfast at 11ish.\n\nI've almost always been greeted warmly by the waitstaff (although they usually don't know me from Adam until my second or third consecutive morning in), the portions are so huge I can't finish my ham and eggs (and I can eat a LOT of ham) and the eggs benedict is one of the best I've had anywhere. Prices are reasonable, and the coffee cups are large. (Tip: go easy on the sparkly colored sugar in your coffee - the stuff is even sweeter than \"Sugar in the Raw.\")\n\nThe only other place in Vegas that I'd even consider recommending for breakfast in LV is the Grand Lux at the Venetian, but that's like being the second best golfer to Tiger Woods. \n\nAnd I do admit I've never been in the lounge, but I hear it's awesome as well."

We came here because our limo driver convinced us it was popular and good. \n\nThis place is a diner. The inside is very colorful as in purple, green, turquoise, yellow. From what I remember jungle themed.  Inside its a bit sketchy. Nothing like the other restaurants on the strip. Crowd was a bit more \"hood\" or \"ghetto\". Please don't hate me for these comments. \n\nWe ordered a grilled chicken burger and a basket of fruit to go. The 2 others we were with stayed to dine in. They got breakfast. Lets just say they finished eating before we got our take out order. Once our order finally came she forgot our fruit basket and the check. We almost ended up leaving at the same time as the 2 that actually stayed and dined in. \n\nService was terrible!!!!!  \n\nI think I have to come back, dine in and try their breakfast."

However, if you like dining with a lamp hanging in your face, this place fits the bill. It's unfortunate, because the decor and neon lights are cool. In the end, we felt like we were in a bad episode of Charlie's Angels. The food was very sub par. I ordered the \"signature\" burger, and found it dry and flavorless. My wife's turkey burger was unseasoned, bland, and tasted like charcoal. The sweet potato fries were limp, and tasted like they had been sitting in a pool of grease. You can't order drinks from your server, so you have to track down the cocktail waitress. We tried the Scorpion, which supposedly had six shots. It was basically a bowl of ice and fruit juice. There was also a guy going around offering to take a complimentary picture. It reminded me of the guy who would make balloon animals at Carlos Murphy's back in the 80s. The free picture was 3x5. He was harassing a family of Scandinavian tourists trying to get them to buy an 8x10 saying that this was the best deal they would find on the Strip. Overall my stomach felt like rocks the rest of the night. Thanks Peppermill for providing memories we will never forget!"

Great food at a reasonable price.\n\nWent here with one of my buddies after night one of Vegas.  We knew that going to something at the Grand would be expensive and probably not very good, so we asked the door guys for the best restaurant in the neighborhood.  They both agreed the Peppermill was the spot.  It's also close to many places on the strip, a ~5 dollar uber ride or 10 dollar cab ride for us.  \n\nWhile we were on our way, I was anticipating this quaint little diner, maybe some knick knacks on the walls, etc.  Well, I was mistaken to say the least.  Going in here, everything is neon and mirrors.  That being said, it was 7 in the morning (we were on Florida time still) and the place had plenty of people, so it was a good bet this place was legit.\n\nThe menu itself is impressive.  So many different varieties of breakfast food.  I got the French Toast Ambrosia, which is just, enormous.  Whoever can eat this in one sitting is clearly contributing to the national health care crisis.  The french toast was very good, not too heavy.  However, it is laden with whipped cream and about 5 different kinds of fruit, so it will fill you up.  The half a liter of syrup I added to it may have contributed to its density as well.  The fruit is good and fresh.  It's not mind blowing, but this is a LOT of food for a great price and, if you're staying at a hotel or something, you can bring back leftovers and have several breakfasts or share with friends.\n\nIf you're in the area, bring your sunglasses and come down here to grab a bite.  It's a great way to escape the hotels and have some good food in a more local-type Vegas atmosphere."

Oh what to do?!!?  Yep, open up Yelp and let my taste buds do the walking.  \n\nThe closest place that wasn't fancy or didn't require a reservation was The Peppermill.  As we walked past the place (had to get to a crosswalk) it looked like a fun place to have dinner and the rest of you Yelpers had it at 4-stars...so we gave them a shot.  From the outside, the place didn't look like much more than a fancy NJ Diner...just with more neon.\n\nWhen we got inside I realized the place was bigger than it seemed, but it STILL looked like a neon bathed NJ diner...so I was hoping for a good meal at a good price.  The menu here is pretty large, but we were here for a couple of steaks...nothing too fancy, but something that would sit in my stomach for the 5+ hour flight home (what were we thinking?).  Ernesto came over and took our drink orders and was back quickly for the food orders.  We skipped the appetizers (though the meal did come with salad) and we ordered a couple of NY Strips...my buddy added a side of fettuccini alfredo and I stuck with my potato...and we both also got a side of cooked, marinated mushrooms.  We waited a bit for Ernesto to come back with our salads and I asked him 2x for water.  When the salads arrived a waitress named Gabby delivered them and I asked for more water (this time it took about 45 seconds).\n\nOk, I know what you're thinking...these idiots ordered steaks at what amounts to a fancy diner?!?!  Yep...don't judge a book by its cover.  My steak, though a little small, was actually quite delicious.  Cooked with just some salt and cracked pepper it was tasty and done just medium.  My co-worker had to send his back as his was still mooing, but it came back quickly and was more to his liking.  For some reason, Ernesto disappeared and we ended up with Gabby as our waitress.  Now, I'm not one to judge, but this being Vegas and all, I don't think this was the only job Gabby had...Gabby was very friendly, quite a beautiful young woman, and honestly a great waitress.  I hope she ended up taking the tip instead of Ernesto who did nothing more than take our order.\n\nGonna give The Peppermill 3.5 stars and have to round down.  The undercooked steak, the disappearing waiter, the multiple requests for water...the service could have been better (though it got better with Gabby)."

This place is remarkable not only for enduring as one of the last of the old Vegas but because the service, portions and quality have all remained consistently high throughout at least the last 30 years.  They've tweaked when conditions necessitate but haven't really changed what they do because what they do is provide great quality and value without caring what trends dictate at the moment.

Went for breakfast at 8 am and walked into a disneyworld like set up with shiny stainless steel, pink and purple velvet wall trimmings and flamingo stainglass lights. The sugar is even multicolored and the coffee cups are the size of a small thermos. Breakfast is huge too. We got one of the specials with spanish sausage, onions, peppers cooked with hashbrowns and fresh eggs and cheese. Yummy! The bar has this absolutely cool fire place/water pool thing you have to check out. Oh, and of course you can get a bloody mary or strawberry daquiri if your inclined. Would of been more stars but no options under 11$ for a breakfast is a bit steep."

It is a nod to the old Vegas. If you are on the town, this is a great place to wind down an evening with good friends."

Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues?\n\nAll kidding aside, the best thing about this restaurant is the decor.  It screams cheesiness and vintage Vegas, with its faux neon lights and the veritable faux forest.  When was the last time you saw a deciduous tree in the middle of the desert?  I love the decor, and make sure that I always step into the lounge, open 24 hours a day, to see the fire and water fountain as well as the cocktail servers in the evening gowns split up to...here.\n\nNow to the substance.  Peppermill is an institution.  It has been around seeming forever, and had a scene from \"Casino\" filmed there with Sharon Stone.\n\nThe food is average, at best.  It is also overpriced.  The place is best on its breakfast foods, in my humble opinion.  The omelets are huge, but again, overpriced.\n\nThe appetizer sampler platter is good, but overpriced.  Oddly enough, the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item.\n\nI recommend this place for drinks in the lounge, and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the Strip.  The place, while overpriced, is still cheaper than the buffet.  And more fun.\n\nAre you noticing a trend here?  I will hit you over the head with it one more time...overpriced."

The Peppermill has a great atmosphere, decent food, and hefty drinks. I brought an out-of-town friend here who, like me, has an appreciation for the ridiculous and the brightly colored, which this venue has many times over with tons of pink neon lights and 80's music videos playing on repeat. \n\nWe grabbed a seat just above the fire and water sunken living set, and were greeted promptly by a server. We ordered a few drinks and went with classic mozzarella sticks and the Sriracha chicken bites. The food was pretty basic, but I would recommend the Sriracha chicken bites, especially if you're just going to sip and snack. \n\nBeyond the normal vodka soda and martinis, we opted for the Scorpion Bowl. This juggernaut of alcohol and sugar is best served over ice, but if so inclined, you can add ice cream into the mix for that creamy dreamy diabetes fueled coma. The Scorpion Bowl was ok, but insanely sweet and definitely needs to be shared with a fellow boozehound. The bowl is great as a one-time novelty drink, but I wont be ordering this on my next visit to the Peppermill. \n\nCheesy music, velvet couches, and neon lights. I'm there."

So, when she said she wanted to go to a 24-hour place that's so much better than Denny's, I mustered the excitement that I usually reserve for eating Del Taco (\"I guessssss, if there really is nothing elese....).  Upon arrival, you find that it was probably designed by a strip club interior designer:  Neon lights from ceiling to floor and under the tables, mirrored ceilings, sectioned off booths.  Yep, this is Vegas, baby!  \n\nBut, the food, oh the food!  I started with the \"waffle ambrosia\" which is a Paul-Bunyan sized waffle covered with fruit and whip cream.  The waffle has this ultra soft inside, crispy outside, and the cake batter is soooo good...The fruit ambosia is a complete cocktail of freshly cut fruit of strawberries, cantaloupe, melon, grapes, pineapple, and bananas.  And you can tell they just cut it right now...as in 5 seconds ago.  And, if you're not a waffle person, the pancakes are just as good.  \n\nSo, what else?  Because no person is full on just waffles (I can barely eat half)....\n\nBone-in Ham Steak:  Do you love ham?  Do you hate ham?  Who cares?  This ham steak is so thick and juicy that you wonder why anyone bothers to eat that sliced sandwich ham stuff.  Aesthetically pleasing too with grill marks.  \n\nNachos:  BIGGEST NACHOS ever!  Warm chips!  Big chunks of meat!  \n\nOmelets: They use 10 eggs in every omelet and it's so fluffy and yummy... awww....\n\nIce Cream Sundae for $8:  I have no idea why anyone would want to order this.  Why does anyone order an $8 ice cream sundae?  Now I know.  It's like 3-4 servings of Baskin Robbins sundae...with two bananas and the best strawberry ice cream with real strawberry chunks.  There's chocolate and vanilla ice cream and good nuts and a boat load of whip cream. \n\nHonestly, every dish is like the perfect dream: the quality is super high, the food is super fresh, the portions are way too big for one person, and you'll eat food in a way that you wonder why there are even other restauants open.  After awhile, you don't know what to order because you crave the waffle ambrosia but you also want some ham-steak.  The last two times we were in Vegas, we had to have it twice a day...No food can really compare.  \n\nAnd the best part?  A dinner for six with drinks is just a little under $100 with tax and tip.   \n\nAnd strangely enough, every single waitress is really giddy and sincerely nice.  \n\n(Peppermill, if you happen to read this which I know makes no sense because I'm assigning human qualities to a restaurant, then please open one in Sourthern California)."

Otherwise, I'm not liking your chances.  In other words, the portion sizes are quite large.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and a Miller Lite(!)...was able to muscle my way through them, but barely touched the accompanying refried beans.  Very tasty.\n\nI sat at the counter, so I was able to see a lot of entrees come off the line and hear the waitresses complain about each other.  Riveting.\nThe waffle would feed a family of four, I swear.\n\nThe Peppermill is just a diner with a lot of flair.  I'll return on my next visit to LV.  You should too!\n\n\nNOTE:  I.F.O.C.E. = International Federation of Competitive Eating"

Two of the three eggs were way over done, so our server got a new order. By the time the they came out, the rest of the breakfast was finished, and the new order was over cooked as well."

My friends and I came here for brunch on a Sunday and it was pretty packed. The food was really good and so was the Bloody Mary, which I guess they're known for.\n\nI got the Reuben sandwich and it was definitely one of the better Reubens I've had. Some of the other things my group ordered included the corned beef hash (probably everyone's favorite), eggs Benedict, and some other things that didn't stand out.\n\nOverall, it's worth a try if you're looking for a brunch spot on the strip that's not in the hotels."

You can get a steak here for $29.50 max, and that's with shrimp scampi.  We ended up going here instead of eating at the steakhouse in the Paris, where a steak was $40.  Of course, you could probably eat at IHOP or Denny's for cheaper, but we wanted to go someplace that we'd never been to.\n\nWe were blown away by the shiny ceilings, neon, flamingo lamps, and the goofy trees all over.  I would say it's worth it just to see the decor.  \n\nThey have a cocktail waitress that never came to our table, which was really annoying.  We had six people that wanted to drink, so I guess it was their loss.  \n\nThe food came in shockingly vast quantities and most of us left with our plates still half full of food.  We ordered two breakfasts, two steaks, and one pasta dish and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I have no idea if we'll be back unless someone in our party hasn't seen the place, as the food is really just diner food, but it's a good place to experience if you're dying for something that is typical Las Vegas and worth taking photos of."

Well this time it wasna horrible experience when my wife and I arrived it was jammed packed there was a 45 min wait.  So we were offered to sit in the lounge to have a drink and wait for a table. Well we walked in and it was dark and it looked like a sex den out of the 70's tables were dirty and there were questionable stains on the cloth lounges I was feeling a bit uncomfortable. So a waitress cleaned off our table and asked what we wanted to drink so my wife ordereda drink for us to share because it was a large drink and I hadnt ate yet. But the kicker was that the Peppermill has a no hat policy in their lounge? Strange I had a hat on it was a tastful hat nothing gang related or any of that cliche stuff, I was asked to remove my hat because they had problems in the past with people wearing hats strange? I refuse to remove my hat because not only I didnt see a sign stating it but i saw few indivduals in the same area wearing hats so I asked for management, management arrived and she stated that it was just there policy she could gove me a solid reason for the policy she proceeded to tell me about their lawyers came up with this policy odd? So I asked her if I had an open wound or religous wrap hat on my head I would be refused services or would be asked to leave there lounge at this point I was bother by the BS policy the manager offered to see if she could bump up our table wait so im able eat in their dining room with my hat but cant drink in their lounge what BS. I was uncomfortable about the whole thing and I left. This nearly cost my vacation to be ruined cause my wife wanted to eat there still at the Peppermill and i refused too because their double standard unexplainable rule."

I have never been in here when it's dead, there's always people traipsing in and out for their delicious breakfasts.  Plus, when you get there you're probably loaded.  So deciding to have breakfast in a place that looks like a strip club is an experience to be had.  Last time I was in Vegas, I stopped here for breakfast the second I got into town and was not disappointed.  I am not sure what anyone else got, but I also didn't care--I got their biscuit breakfast and it was awesome!  My time there was cut short cause my brother and sister got into a cab with a man that took them 15 miles out of Las Vegas and they needed to be rescued.  Of course, I made them wait to get picked up until I was done eating!"

Definitely an old-school romantic diner type feel. Got seated at a booth and had a pretty hard time choosing between their menu ranging from Southern fried steak to breakfast foods to pasta. While deciding, we got our picture taken in the booth, whcih we got to keep - cute.\n\nEnded up ordering the following and definitely had to split up to the ginormous portions:\n\n-Seafood omelette: Even split two-ways between Kathleen W. and I wasn't enough to finish this. Filled with shrimp and crab, we wondered how many eggs went in this breakfast monster that could easily take up room in a cake box. Hashbrowns were not as great as I would have liked, but the taste of the omelette was just how I would have wanted it, with a good amount of hollandaise and cheese\n\n-Nachos appetizer: Mound of beans, carne, jalapeno, nachos, and real cheese that you can dip in guac and salsa - basically a heart attack ready to happen, but quite tasty while warm\n\n-Fish n chips: Not gonna lie, these were surprisingly good. Thick slices of cod and curly fries was a total win.\n\n-Mudslide: Delicious with real ice cream in there (much better than the pre-made stuff I usually blend). Girls said they could really taste a lot of alcohol, but I really just enjoyed it like a milkshake\n\nSuper filling meal where less than 3 dishes almost exploded our tummies with awesome. A great way to end our Vegas weekend.\n\n*Note: Apparently if we would have told them it was our friend's b-day, we would have gotten a pretty large sundae, but we had difficulty moving ourselves afterwards, so probably a good idea that we didn't let that go to waste by telling them :P"

The fire is actually in the lounge area which I couldn't go into since I'm not 21. We were seated in the restaurant area which was decorated with lots of plants and flower decor with blue and pink lighting. I expected it to be very blue and pink, but a lot darker, so this was way brighter than I expected. \n\nI ordered the Conquest Sandwich and coffee and my boyfriend ordered a burger with mushrooms ( I dont remember the name). \n\nThe coffee was HUGE, probably as big as a regular soda cup. It was pretty cool for pictures, but since it was so big, by the time I got halfway the coffee would already be cold. \n\nThe mushroom burger came first. It came with a bunch of fries and a side of ranch. The fries was pretty especially with the ranch which was very light, not like most other places with thick fatty ranch.  The burger LOOKED delicious , but it was so soggy and soaked in juices from the sauces and meat that it just fell apart once my boyfriend picked it up. He couldn't even eat the buns anymore because it was just completely soggy, so he just ate the contents of the burger with a knife and fork.  \n\nThe Conquest was pretty good from what I recall. I finished my whole half of the sandwich which me and my boyfriend split. It wasn't as fantastic as I expected from the description on the menu, but it was good. It didn't come with any sides at all, so it was just the sandwich. \n\nThe portions we got weren't worth the price of the food. I expected more for what I paid, especially after reading these reviews. I also expected the food to be a lot better because, yet again, the great reviews. \n\nThe service was alright though. The waitress would check up on us here and there to fill the coffee and water. She'd also check to make sure we had everything we needed. \n\nWe probably won't come back here again. At least not until I'm 21 and can check out the lounge :P"

I'm actually surprised he found this place because it's not one of the first things to pop up. Anyways we came here around 10:30AM on a Friday and it was pretty busy. \n\nThe scenery totally draws you in. It's dark with neon purple blue lights running with fake trees and plants. Totally unexpected, but it was nice.  Even the table had some colorful sugar! You can always ask for plain sugar though. (:  Oh and the seats are all mostly booth seats. Yay. \n\nThe food. Wow. Seriously. Did I mention big portions? My boyfriend got one of their specialty omelettes and I got the Belgium Waffle (can I be anymore boring?). Anyways, the omelette came in a huge plate with depth, and 3 slices of toast. Big. Filling. Delicious. I wish I had gotten an omelette. Belgium Waffle. So crisp and so fluffy. Minus the fact I had to scoop off the huge amount of butter on it since I forgot to ask for it on the side. Yea presentation of the food may not be the best, but at least you know you're getting the best for your dollar. (:\n\nService. The lady at the front was so nice! She starts conversation and attends to you ASAP. The waitresses wear these old school uniforms, and work fast. So you can expect to get your food quickly. \n\nI'll be coming back here for breakfast/brunch if I stay on the strip. Better than waiting in line at those over priced brunch/breakfast places on the strip."

We by-passed them and went to the Fireside Lounge side of the facility. We ordered a few cocktails a fruit/cheese plate, BIG bowl of Onion Rings as big as your head...and a plate of sliders. I didn't touch the fruit/cheese, overdosed on Onion Rings as planned and had a slider with maybe a few chips.  The food was again, awesome.

Sure, it's cheesy and dated but honestly, after all the ostentatious marble and gilt-covered surfaces of places like the Bellagio and Caesar's, it's a nice change. It's dark and funky and relatively quiet after being in noisy casinos all day. We came here for a late night snack so I can't comment on the full dinner experience but what I had was good (not great, but good) and hit the spot. Our waitress was attentive but not overly so and kept the refills coming in a timely fashion.\n\nIt wasn't too busy the night we stopped in and we almost had the place to ourselves which makes me think we may have missed out on the full Peppermill experience. Ah well, there are plenty of other opportunities to run into crazy people while in Vegas."

Plus, they did an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffees here.

Neon all over the place and kitschy as hell! (In a good way) I know all the reviews talk about this but I can't stress this enough: the portions are huge!! If you're like me and like to have leftovers, by all means get a plate just for yourself and unless you're Joey Chestnut or Adam Richman, you can expect more than enough for another full meal at home. If you're a tourist though and won't be taking a doggie bag, please do yourself a favor and share a plate with your partner so there won't be so much food wasted. The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the waitress, although friendly, just wasn't super attentive. That being said, I'd definitely come back and would most likely bring a date because this restaurant/lounge is just too kitschy/glitzy/vegasy (is that a word?) not to love."

Sure it holds a lot of sentimental value for me, but once you get over all the things people HATE Vegas for, you realize how amazing this Postmodern Paradise is in all its glory. \n\nThat said, I'm so happy that a place like Peppermill exists, but pretty disappointed that it's taken me 27 years to finally discover and go here. \n\nThis place is SOOOOOO cheesy Vegas - I know there's a Canter's in Vegas, but if Canter's fully embraced the aesthetic of the city, it would look like this place. The ceiling, walls and columns are adorned with mirrorball tiles, the lampshades are stained glass flamingos, and every plant i the place is made of plastic. Even the sugar are rainbow sprinkles! Just don't get too excited and then having to deal with an entire handful of the stuff you have no business really holding. \n\nThe menu is pretty comprehensive - you've got steak, sammies and everything a 24/7 diner-like place should have. Prices are kind of on the steep side, but the food is tasty. We went there at 11pm after spending an entire day in the sun with thousands of others watching awesome bands and had nothing to consume all day with the exception of a cup of cereal in the morning and a beer here and there throughout the day. By the time we got there, we were all FAMISHED. \n\nThe varied menu made it hard to choose, but I nabbed myself a pastrami sandwich, which was perhaps on my top ten list of Best Choices I've Made in My Short Life. It may have been the fact that I was super hungry, but I do not exaggerate when I say I was nearly reduced to tears after each bit of my cured meat on sourdough bread I was so happy. I chewed with the biggest smile on my face while a chorus of angels one can hear even past the super loud decor surrounding me. If I was challenged to marry the thing, I would have plowed over my boyfriend and dashed to the nearest chapel where Elvis would have married us, and our honeymoon would be spent skipping the \"honeymoon\" part and would have gone directly to praying mantis mode and devoured my mate. It was that good. \n\nOh, I sampled other peoples' food as well, and it was all pretty good. \n\nBut back to my sandwich. I don't know...we may have been caught up in the moment, maybe it was just good timing. I don't know if I were to return, things would be the same, but maybe...just maybe, I'll give it a try."

Each pancake probably weighs a solid pound, their omelets are made with TEN eggs, and their hash browns are beautifully crispy and will not leave you wanting anything more. I wouldn't recommend the waffles unless you've really got a craving (you do you), only because they're pretty ordinary in size and taste and don't even come with sides. Their lemon-cranberry muffin is sweet enough to be a dessert on its own! \n\nThis place is garish and gaudy and they know it!

Mirrored ceiling tiles, pink and blue lighting, fake flowers, and flamingo lamps! Wow. Hello vegas. I've missed you.\n\nThe breakfast menu was extensive and the feta cheese and vegetable omlette caught my eye. Artchokes at a restaurant that looks like a strip club? Yes please!! I saw they had a meal with turkey sausage but it wasn't listed on the 'Sides' menu. Plus a side of meat was $5 and so that wouldn't have won anyways. The boyfriend got a ham and cheese omlette and about 15 minutes later, two giant plates arrived before us. Each omlette must have been made with at least 5 eggs and there were about 2 potatoes worth of hashbrowns. My omlette was delicious and there were tons of vegetables and some provolone cheese melted in the centre, with feta on top. We both managed to take half of our meals to go and they fully fed us the next morning too. For $12 per meal, that's an awesome deal.\n\nI would have to say that the perfect ending to our meal was a party of 3 who came and sat across from us. Not only did one member have a giant 1L bottle of watter with him, but he also put on his sunglasses 5 minutes after they arrived. A hangover at its best! But what's with the coloured sugar??"

From the huge breakfast portions, to the breakfast bloody marys, to the waitresses (I swear ours was a stripper at nite!).  The BEST part of this place, the fireside lounge!  Straight out of an '70s porn set/ night club scene!  I LOVE IT!!!\n\nThe food was pretty good, country fried steak & eggs, how can you go wrong?  And how would you know if it was wrong because its smothered in yummy gravy!  The corned beef hash was pretty good, nice and salty.  The one flop of the meal was someone's peppermill omelet.  Otherwise, the steak and eggs were good, as were the pancakes.  Another goodie was the Bloody Mary that was brought out by the drink hostess in a long black evening dress @ 10AM.  FUN!\n\nAll in all a fun experience!"

My cousin ordered the appetizer that came with chicken tenders, bruschetta, onion rings,  mozzarella sticks,  onion rings and butterfly shrimp. It was enough to share with the five of us.

But I'll stop and let this interview excerpt do the talking: \n\n\"Flowers and Keuning head for lunch at the Peppermill, an all night restaurant on the strip. It opened in the seventies, and it's just the kind of place the Killers dig- a bit weird, and seemingly immune from vacationing Midwesterners. \"We hate big crowds,\" Keuning says.\"You can always just pop in and get a bite here. It's a cool place.\" Eating their salads and runny egg specials, Keuning and Flowers stick out among the Peppermill patrons, most of whom are dressed in tees and tank tops. Flowers wears a cream colored, fake alligator skin jacket he got in London: Keuning is in a shiny gray vest and Dior aviators. But no one bothers them or even seems to recognize them, and you sense that's one reason they like places like the Peppermill. Especially Flowers.\"\n\nSo go on, maybe you'll even spot Vegas' most famous rock band...\nhttp://thesponge-dani.blogspot.com/2011/10/victims-pilgrimage-killers-fans-guide.html"

The sandwich was packed with pesto, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. The bread was a nice toasty, crusty ciabatta full of flavor; nice and chewy too. I also tried some of my friend's buffalo wings! That was so delicious. The chicken wings and drumsticks were super meaty and not like those tiny ones you might get at other places. The ranch was good and didn't taste like it came straight out the bottle. I definitely need to go back to try the rest of the menu. I thought the decor was cute and kitschy.  Bright neon lights with cute trees inside the restaurant. It was a very 1960s super groovy, swinging good time! Seven thumbs up~"

I had better luck this time around w/the Maserati omelet filled w/jack and cheddar cheeses, mushrooms and smothered in italian meat sauce.  Very hearty, but def could've used more meat smotherin' since its a massive fluffy omelet. It's almost like a wall/brick of egg, so u need a lot of extras for all that egg.

Using Yelp! app, I came across The Peppermill.\n\nThe decor is very unique.  There's a lot of neon lights, mirrored ceilings, and fake trees.  I didn't see the fireside lounge because the wait was a mere 5 minutes to be seated.  The place was fairly busy, so service was not very fast, but you can't blame the servers for that.\n\nI asked for a recommendation and our server suggested Munch's Breakfast.  Sausage with peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, topped with eggs and cheese?  Sounds great!  I was excited.  The meal came out and it felt like it was missing something.  It felt like I was eating a vegetable omelette - I realized that there was NO sausage.  I called the server over - not the easiest task when she's running around tending to many tables - and she said asked if I wanted to have them remake it.  I told her no since the person I came with was almost done with her meal.  She later brought out a plate of sausages.  Apparently the prep cook forgot to bring out the sausages and the cook just threw everything together not realizing that the sausage wasn't there.\n\nI realize that mistakes happen and it wasn't the server's fault so I didn't tip her less than I would have for the service.  But I wish she addressed this with management so that they could have made some sort of adjustment for leaving out the sausage.  Seriously, that's like giving someone a car without brakes.  A chair with no legs.  A hooker with no condom.  All of the above may work but leads to an incomplete and potentially regretable experience.\n\nSo while I would probably have given this place 4 stars, I have to give it 3.  Give it a shot, but realize that the cook may be high and leave out key ingredients."

The atmosphere itself is a mix between a 70s lounge and an 80s arcade. Very cool. Plus they serve liquor, which is a huge plus. I found the Bloody Mary, while quite generous in size, a little lacking in flavor for my tastes. The Coronaritas however were completely awesome.

            "review": "I could write a ten page diatribe on why I love this place.  I will start with a review for the lounge.  I will then proceed with a review for the restaurant.  I will then sum up my LOVE for Peppermill with a review for their \"banquet\" services - because, yes, when you get married in Vegas... you MUST have your reception at the Peppermill.  That's the only way to roll in this town.\n\nLounge:  seedy, swanky, and fabulous!  The service is fantastic.  I love that these are the most dressed up cocktail waitresses in Vegas.  Long sleek black gowns.  Nice touch.  The drinks are fabulous.  In the morning.  In the afternoon.  At 2 am.  They are delicious, potent, and worth the money.  I love the flaming fire pit adorned with tvs.  I love the electric glow of purple and pink.  The fake foliage?  Very nice.  The chairs are comfortable (even though I have a small fear of what might be on them in the darkest corners, I take some relief in the glowing purple lights overhead... about as close to black light as we're gonna get).  Looking for a nice place to hang out with your buddies after a late night?  Or a place to get the party started at 10 pm?  Peppermill lounge is the perfect spot.  I would say the parking is super easy.  The lot behind the building is huge.  But if you're going to drink... you won't need to worry about parking.  Take a cab.  They're located at the north end of The Strip, on the immediate north side of Ross Dress For Less.  Now go.  Drink.  And Be Merry.\n\nRestaurant:  bring an appetite.  And a tupperware container or three.  The food is fun.  There is a great variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.  I've never had anything here I didn't like.  The portions are MASSIVE.  You can eat until chorizo is popping out of your ears and then you'll look down and still see half of your plate full of food.  Good thing there are fridges in the rooms at the hotel!  The blueberry muffins are warm, moist, and delicious.  Don't waste your time on boring ol' toast.  Oh, you wanted the banana nut bread?  Yeah - you're going to receive and entire LOAF of banana nut bread.  Prepare to share.  My friend ordered the fruit plate with marshmallow dipping sauce.  They brought her a fruit cart (exaggerating, people... but go with it).  In all seriousness - she probably ate her 5 servings of fruit and still took home THREE containers of fruit for later.  And a 2/3 of a a banana bread.  If you're looking for a good deal in Vegas - eat here.  You'll easily get two meals out of one.  And when you're hung over and hankering for a little something when you roll in the door at 5 am - why not nosh on a little banana bread?\n\nBanquet services:  Hubs and I had a morning wedding.  Celebrated with champagne and cupcakes immediately after (see my review for The Cupcakery in Henderson, NV).  Then we took all of our guests to lunch at The Peppermill.  We made arrangements with JoAnn a few weeks prior... selected a set menu, picked out colors and table decorations, got a map of the restaurant to make a seating arrangement... and all we had to do was show up.  It was such a blast!  We had about 1/3 of the restaurant blocked off just for us.  Cocktail waitresses took orders, waitresses took food orders, and we were good to go.  We are proud to say that our friends had never had a bacon cheeseburger at a wedding reception until they came out ours!  Chicken foccacia?  Yup.  Fruit platter.  All us.  The atmosphere was so much fun.  The tables looked fantastic.  The service was excellent.  And it was so neat to see our names on the little display board when we first arrived.  I'm not a traditional sit-down boring reception type person... so the Peppermill fit my and my husbands personality perfectly.  I think everyone had a good time and I'm forever grateful to JoAnn and the crew at The Peppermill for helping to make my special day that much more special... and unique!  \n\nIf you're looking for something \"Vegasy\" to do while in Vegas, plan a trip to the Peppermill.  AND you can say you saw the table that Vince Vaughn sat at in Swingers.  How can you say not to that???"

I loved the CFS but everything was cooked in an oil that I didn't really like the after taste of. But smothered in gravy and didn't notice it on the CFS. My husband salad was very much lacking. It had very nice tortilla pieces in the center but they were so stale they weren't very edible. There really wasn't enough beans or avocado to really make this a southwestern. The chicken was cooked very well, very juicy. But overall not worth the price. Luckily we got 25% off for the wait. \n\nWe went to the Fireside Lounge and this visit was totally redeemed. It was early on Tuesday and plenty of seating available. We got a nice little corner in front of the fire pit. Gorgeous! We ordered the Scorpion and it was Delicious! Well worth $18. It's a great romantic environment. I will be returning whenever we have family in town."

And then when you check back after u have waited for the time they told you to wait, they will add on another 20 minutes??? Ok. So you wait and in the meanwhile you see about 5 more parties of three and four go in front of you. HORRIBLE!! And all they can say is \"its going to be a longer wait cause you have a big party\". Yeah no sh*t! But you've been waiting for the longest time while you are seeing others get seated. In my opinion not worth the wait. Avoid this place and go to Denny's which is right next to it. (Only if you have a big group) cause obviously you get seated quicker if you have about 3 people with you. =\\"

            "review": "so there really should be two separate listings for the restaurant and the lounge because it's night and day. my friend chose this place to have a quick birthday dinner before a night on the town. the outside of this place looks very outdated and not classy at all. but based on the reviews and the location of this place, we decided to give it a try.\n\ninside is just as worse as it looks on the outside. its like a 1970's ate up the amazon forest and threw it up in here. decor is just horrible. we took a peak inside the Fireside Lounge and at least that part looked a lot better but unfortunately, they don't serve the full menu which was what most of the people in our party wanted. \n\nanyway, we were seated in a long booth for our party of 9, all facing the same direction which was really awkward so we asked to have a few extra chairs so that we could sit across from each other instead of sitting on a bench and having to yell like we were benchwarmers. luckily the servers were nice enough to let us do that even though we would be blocking the walk way. the menu was pretty extensive, but honestly, it's just like a typical diner. some of us ordered breakfast, some just a salad, some ordered sandwiches. none were spectacular. i shared the gyro sandwiches which came with a side of sweet potato fries for $12. it was OK. \n\nmy review may sound pretty rough but i'll still give it 3 stars because it wasn't too horrible. it's just a glorified Denny's on the Vegas strip...even though that's STILL not saying much. at least the service wasn't bad."

I love everything about Peppermill. The decor transports me to a magical tacky fairy forest. Perfect when you are drunk and looking for good eats. The waitresses are decked out in equally tacky but booty gazing outfits. Love it. They have plenty of personality too and you have to if you are wearing that fit. The food portions are huge so dont order multiple plates. If you are going with your significant other give the fireside lounge a try. Its really romantic sitting next to the fire with neon lights all around you sipping on a huge and delicious drink. They are open 24/7 so even if your late night turns into an early morning which tends to happen in Vegas stop in. Its not too far from all the major hotels and all the taxi drivers know whats up."

For a Monday morning, it was pretty crowded when we arrived at 10:30 am. Wait time was about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table. We weren't in a huge rush, so it didn't bother us.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when we walked in was the large amount of neon pink throughout the restaurant. Not only that, but there are also lots of fake trees and plants. It totally gives it a kitschy diner feel and reminds me of why I love Vegas! The menu is large and you can get anything on it 24 hours a day. Feeling hungry for an omelet - check; feeling like a chicken caesar wrap - check; does shrimp scampi sound good - check; how about ribs - check. If you're craving it, I bet it's on the Peppermill menu.\n\nMy husband and I stuck with breakfast since it was mid-morning. I had the eggs and bacon and my husband had a belgian waffle. He liked the waffle well enough and it was quite large. My scrambled eggs were cooked well (not watery at all) and my bacon came out crispy as ordered. I hated the hash browns - not only were they not cooked all the way, but they lacked the crispiness that I prefer. It was basically just a pile of potato on the plate. For a soda, glass of orange juice and 2 breakfast entrees, our bill came to $29 before tip.\n\nWe were a tad disappointed in the food, but I guess if you go late at night after a full night of drinking, it probably is decent."

I remember Peppermill from Santa Clara of the mid 1990's - I hear it's gone - it was the same place as this, though randomly placed across Intel, HP, AMD buildings- an oasis/breath of fresh air amid a rapidly developed Silicon Valley locus, same vibe, same neon, all good...."

A ton of variety, I've been there several times and don't think I have ever repeated a dish.  \nThe lounge attached to the restaurant is really cool.  Dark circular seating areas make it a great place for cocktails with friends or dates.  The fire pit near the front is cool too, with plasma TVs all around you shouldn't miss any of the game either.\nThere seems to be a good mix of tourist and locals here.  I think when you come across a spot locals keep going back to, you have found a special place that hasn't been totally destroyed by tourists."

Has been open since the 70s and I hope it doesn't change !!I have to say that the quality of the food certainly hasn't changed I have the French toast collage which consists of eggs sausage on four pieces of French toast and the serving for enough for two people it was delicious the French toast was golden and crispy on the outside the scrambled eggs were so fluffy and the sausage is the biggest I've ever seen! No matter what time of day I go the place is always packed!! You must come here instead of the basic casino cafe."

The Peppermill has been on the north end of the Vegas strip for over thirty years. Many a casino has come and gone in those years but the Peppermill and the adjacent Firseide Lounge has survived.  It is well known for its neon glow, its cute car hop uniformed waitresses and its huge food portions.\n You don't need to worry about the time of day because the Peppermill is open 24 hours and serves Breakfast,Lunch and Dinner anytime. This makes it a perfect late night stop or the place to cure your morning after hangover. For Simone and I, it was the hangover cure, and we arrived mid morning and were immediately seated.  After looking over the waitress, I mean menu, I decided to order the Reuben Sandwich and French Fries. Simone decided to go for the Breakfast menu and ordered a spinach, feta and tomato omelete with hash browns and a Bran Muffin. My Reuben arrived first and it was massive. In fact, it was a club sandwich with three grilled and buttery homemade slices of Rye bread. Between the first two slices of bread was a heaping mound of fresh sauerkraut with gooey melted Swiss and house made thousand island dressing. The kraut was marinated perfectly with the flavor of whole caraway seeds and was excellent as the bed for the thinly sliced pound or so of grilled pastrami which was piled high on the next layer of rye bread with more melted Swiss. This was the holy grail of sandwiches and I amazingly finished the entire thing. The fries were a little to thick cut for my taste but were still fried crisp and were a good side to my sandwich.  Simones omelet was almost equal in size to my sandwich . It was packed full of spinach , cheese and tomatoes and even had some surprise hash browns mixed in with it ( hopefully not left over on the grill from the day before). Simone was a light weight and only downed about 1/4 of her monster meal. The hash browns that came with the omelet were grated fresh and were grilled crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, just the way they should be and i gladly helped Simone finish them.  The bran muffin also had good flavor and was nice, fresh and moist.\nThe Peppermill is a great experience. Come hungry, because there is plenty to eat and you will want to finish it all.  A great Las Vegas landmark, it is not to be missed. 4 out of 5 for the Peppermill ****"

Definitely a step up from the burgers at Hash House A Go Go.  Portion sizes here are plenty.  My buddy kept calling this place a diner but the food quality is a couple notches higher than what anyone should expect at a diner (whether a chain or not).  Also the decor here is hip and funky.

They have pretty waitresses who aren't slutting it up like many of the casino girls.

Before almost every casino, bar, and restaurant either became 5 stars, a total dump, or was owned by some big conglomerate, there was something in between. The Peppermill, my friends, is just that. \n\nThe Peppermill is a piece of history. Nostalgia if you will. It brings back memories of days gone by. It's nothing fancy. It's simply an old school diner, with old school vinyl booths, waitresses, and colors in a non-pretentious setting that probably hasn't changed in some time. The food is typical diner fare and nothing that will blow your socks off, but I must say that my Denver omelette reminds me of something that even Fred Flinstone would have a hard time finishing. \n\nThe prices, although more than an average diner, aren't too bad, especially compared to some of the lush Vegas breakfast buffets. The Peppermill is located down the strip in front of the Riviera, which means having to fight large crowds and hungover tourists is minimal and an added bonus! \n\nIf you're looking for fresh coffee, fresh eggs, and a side of personality in a casual setting, then look no more. You have reached your destination."

I've been wanting to try Peppermill for a while now, especially with all the reviews. We talked to a few locals who were concert go-ers that night and they highly recommended that we head over to Peppermill.  \n\nWhen you are driving there, just be aware that Peppermill is located somewhat off the strip by the Convention Center. It's next to a Ross and there is ample public parking.\n\nWe entered into Peppermill and it was like stepping into a cheezy night club/vegas dive bar/I really don't even know what. The decor is super cheezy and kitchy. I loved it.  It's definitely one of those \"you must experience it for yourself\" kind of places.\n\nI ordered the eggs benedict per my fellow yelper's recommendations.  I loved the hollendaise sauce and the portion size was amazing. The hash browns were cooked a little longer than usual and they were crunchy and tasty.\n\nThe S.O. ordered a feta omelette and I'm not sure what kind of beast of a creation came out.  As the S.O. was eating his omelette, he said, \"Geeze, I'm getting full, I wonder how many eggs are in this thing?\" The waitress replied, \"Anywhere from 10-12 eggs.\" Holy heart attack, Batman! So what's the point you ask? Share, share, share!  The portions are plentiful here.\n\nThe service was also very friendly and great.

Then I ordered food, and now, this place is a must visit whenever I go to Vegas.  So, when I was trying to find a place to hold my wedding reception, EVERYWHERE we thought of wanted a $5,000 minimum.  I had to keep it cheap.  I thought of Peppermill, but thought the place is too nice, it'll be just as pricey as the rest, if not pricier.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong!!!!  They had a catering menu that topped ALL the other menus I had seen so far, they had steak, chicken, pasta, and salmon all on their $28/ plate catering menu.  They asked for no minimum and no pre-ordering.  So I didn't have to spend time asking people ahead of time if they want chicken or steak which was awesome, because planning even the smallest wedding on your own is hard!  I was in touch with a woman named Peggy Orth the entire time, and she made everything even EASIER!  She was pleasant to deal with, prompt in returning emails, and made a few excellent suggestions.  This is all leading up to my big day.   So the day comes.  They had to wait for people to clear out to make room for my 80+ guests.  All of us went to wait in the fireside lounge, and EVERYBODY loved the lounge as much as I did.  Our tables were all ready in about 10 minutes.  Our food was delicious, and it came quick, especially for not having pre-ordered.  The staff made sure my husband and I had our own \"wedding\" table and made us feel like royalty.  Peggy did an excellent job, i would loved to have met her, but she wasn't working that day.  And that goes to show what a great manager she must be, because she's obviously very organized a good at what she does to set up a party of 80 people and have it go off without a hitch when she's not even there.\nPeppermill is on my official list of All-time favorite places in the world!!!  Everyone from the wedding still talks about how awesome a choice the Peppermill was!!!"

Not much else to say. The service has always been friendly and fairly attentive, even when it's packed at 1-2 in the morning. Waters get filled. Missing silverware is replenished if need be. I get my Tabasco before my meal arrives. Seating isn't too big of an issue either. Parking seemed not be much of a challenge on the weekends either. Don't let the pricing scare you, if the menu said it's $12 for an omelette, you really do get $12 worth of omelette and sides. Not a bargain compared to some other deals around the strip, but it's okay. If I had a choice to skip out on this place late at night and go elsewhere, I wouldn't mind. A change of pace from \"tradition\" or a routine wouldn't hurt anyone, especially in Vegas. If my friends want to go here, I still don't mind.\n\nAs for the food you get, it's not bad. It hits the spot at that time of the night. Always good times to crowd around a booth with a bunch of your buddies just to recap your night of partying and tell stories over a meal. LIke I said, the portions are huge. Unfortunately, having left overs in the middle of a Vegas trip isn't such a great thing since most hotel rooms don't have a fridge, let alone a microwave to reheat your food. If you're a normal eater, sharing your plate with someone else might be a good idea. Or if you're drunk and starving, perfect! I like the fact that a bran muffin is a choice as far as toast/muffin/biscuit options go with your breakfast. I usually save the muffin for the next morning for those really slow starts to the day. You know how it is when you party in Vegas. Sleep late, wake up late. Eat a ....bran muffin with your complimentary hotel coffee?"

Most of the time, the servers are disinterested and not really that hospitable.

First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.\n  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...\n    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  \n   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.\n  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.\n~G"

Both are old school, classic Vegas with the restaurant featuring classic American favorites like burgers, breakfasts, sandwiches, steaks, etc. I've been here many times and most everything I've had is good. The prices are high ($20 for a Chicken Fried Steak) but portions are huge so I guess it's warranted. I'm a healthy eater but I'd easily take half a portion for half the price sometimes. This place is super popular so if you're trying to go at a peak time, either try to find a place at the counter or prepare for a pretty long wait.\n\nThe lounge is also old school with the fire pit being the main attraction. It's dark, leathery, and open 24/7. Definitely a place you want to take a date if you want an a romantic after hours dinner. Like the restaurant, prices are higher than they should be but you just can't beat the ambiance."

I had the chicken pesto sandwich that could have been decent if it weren't for the pile of dry mixed greens smashed on the dry bread. There was cheese in there somewhere and little globs of pesto, but paired with a gristley piece of chicken I was far from impressed. And I know what you're thinking- it's diner food, right? Well, I've been to my fair share of diners and had some really decent meals. This was not one of them.  I got fries on the side which were, shockingly, also not good. Some were cold, some were warm, but all of them mushy. Gross. \nMy husband got an omelet with turkey and cheese and hollandaise sauce. He seemed to think it was okay, but not great. The egg was overcooked and made for a hard, chunk of omelet. \nThe best part of this mess... oh wait, there is no best part... the bill was $28 for the two of us and that was without drinks. \nI give this place one star for tacky, over the top, quintessential  Vegas d\u00e9cor and ambiance. Also, the waitresses wear these terrible tie-dye colored outfits where you can basically see their asses. Except these are not asses you'd want to see.  And then cocktail waitresses come out from the fire side area wearing formal wear to take your drink order. This place is a mess and I recommend it only if you're desperate to go broke for crap food."

Portions are BIG. Maybe share a couple dishes between your party. You will not leave hungry. Small eaters like myself, I guarantee you will have leftovers for the next day.

Boyfriend had his heart set on the Country Fried Steak dinner. He thoroughly enjoyed it! A lot! Both our dinner entr\u00e9e came with your choice of soup OR salad.

The drinks were not very strong at all. We also ordered the fruit & cheese plate($8), which was just cubed up block swiss & cheddar, grapes, a piece of pear and a cup of nuts + about 6 crackers. It was alright, but I could throw a way better cheese plate together with 8 bux, no problem. The reason I gave this place 3 stars instead of the 2 is the ambience & atmosphere. I love the comfy seating & the fireplace. It's SUPER dimly lit, which I love. Overall, I most likely will not be returning on my next trip to Vegas as the stage door has way stronger/cheaper cocktails & is pretty much the same thing, without all the fancy seating."

I remembered ate here as a kid, though all I remembered was their giant hot fudge sundaes (they still have them).\n\nThe Peppermill is a very odd place. From the outside it does not appear to be anything special. Step inside and you will find a coffee shop that looks like a Denny's on acid. There are blues, purples and pinks everywhere. There are mirrored ceilings, tiffany lamps and faux cherry blossom trees.\n\nThe waitresses are wearing very short kimono type shirts/skirts. Making things more bizarre is that there is also a night club in the back that has pools in it that spit out fire on top of the water. Despite all of the craziness, the restaurant is 100% coffee shop in the front.\n\nSERVICE: Everything was right on the money here. There was a delay in bringing my food. Though not a big deal, the manager came over and took a percentage off of the bill without us asking. Everything was very prompt.\n\nFOOD: We ordered breakfast. Their hashbrowns are unique, I have never had ones like it. They were great and I am glad I ordered a plate of them. I could tell that they take great pride in the quality and preparation of all their food. Everything was outstanding. The kids ordered kids plates and loved them. We ate one of their gigantic hot fudge sundaes. The bill was about what you would expect to spend at a Denny's.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: For a great breakfast, you have to go to the Peppermill. It is located center strip and should be easily accessible from any of the Las Vegas hotels. It is truly a unique experience."

It's definitely top 5 in my list of chicken fried steaks. You just can never go wrong with a fried piece of steak. The gravy that they add on top as well is savory, flavorful, and not too overbearing. If you want something breakfast meaty, and don't mind a huge chicken nugget, get this.

I got the tomato, mozzarella and basil on \"toasted\" ciabatta bread. The bread could have been toasted more (but that's my preference). The pesto was tasty. There was a really nice amount of fresh mozzarella. The tomatoes could have been better. They were a little mushy, but when eaten as a sandwich, you didnt notice.

The San Francisco scramble was much better. Mostly I was turned off by the customer experience during my first and only trip there. We approached the counter where the hostess were hanging out, and were not greeted. I had to make awkward eye contact in order to get noticed. Lots of gossiping from the hostess and the overfilled entry made my boyfriend and I head to the bar. Drinks were made with no gusto, and none of the bartenders knew of any specials and referred me to the manager to figure that one out. Hello, it's Super Bowl Sunday on the strip, know your business better. Fast forward a half hour later, sitting down and were asked by waitress if we needed more time, and for the sake of time we ordered promptly. There were so many loud groups and fluorescent lighting I would not recommend for an intimate nor family setting. After our check was brought, I inquired whether I could pay with the waitress, she said okay and walked away. -__- If you're in the area I would try it on a not so busy day. If you're traveling more than 4 miles, avoid and head to a decent restaurant where even if it's busy, customer satisfaction will not be sacrificed."

I do however highly recommend checking out the fireside lounge. They have a pretty neat setup with a full bar and gaming and comfortable lounge style seating.  They also have a firepit with sofas surrounding it.  Very relaxing and nice to take a date or friends to share a \"fishbowl\" sized drink. 21 and over on the fireside section and only appetizers.  I always like to tell my friends \"PM in the AM\" as we seem to go to the Peppermill in the early mornings."

(Sitting around the table with a bunch of friends at 4am digging into a MOUNTAIN of nachos.) \n     Now I only get to visit once a year, since I no longer live just a few hours from Vegas. Some visits have been better than others for sure, but I don't think I've ever walked out unhappy. This time I had the Mediterranean omelet ($14), which was good and the creme brulee ($7), which was OK.\n\nThe Good:\nNot only was the omelet huge but more importantly it was good. There was plenty of pretty good quality shrimp and a fair dose of crab. The Hollandaise sauce was flavorful and complimented it well without taking away from the flavor of the shrimp and crab.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe only complaint, and it's not a severe one, is the waitress didn't do a very good job of keeping up with our drinks. It was just bad enough to be annoying, not bad enough to be frustrating.\n\nThe Indifferent:\nThe hash browns that came with the omelet were fairly unremarkable but I have to warn you, while I will eat them, I'm not a huge fan of hash browns so you might want to take my opinion on this with a little caution. \n     While I don't really expect much from creme brulee, I have had a couple that I really savored. This one wasn't in that category, while it was good enough it wasn't any better or worse than the average."

I looked at the list and saw my name up high with a bunch of crossed out names below mine. I was rudely told we had not been past over and would be next. \nI kept thinking \"everyone raves about this place. The food better be damned good because their service surely sucked.\" Unfortunately, it wasn't. I ordered buffalo wing appetizers and they looked like they came straight out of a Sysco bag and into the deep fryer. The taste reminded me of something they may have fed us in grade-school. \nMy entr\u00e9e was shrimp scampi; half a dozen or so over-cooked shrimp in some oily sauce. The saving grace was the rice pilaf. Yes, it also looked like it was boiled, or microwaved in a bag, but it was not bad. \nThe atmosphere - remember the drunk lady?  Well we were at the table right next to her and every sentence was \"f this and f that, this persons an a-hole, f, f,f.....\" I would have said something but she was in a group of people including a large man wearing a \"Tap Out\" shirt who would have likely tied me into a pretzel and made me tap-out. \nTo summarize: lousy service, pre-prepared food that you could make better yourself, and a loud terrible atmosphere. We will not be back and the people who raved about this place to me should have their head (and tastebuds) examined."

Coffee: decent. Our waitress was stoned and the prices were a bit high too. Still, the convenience- (nice to be able to park right next to a decent eats on the strip) and cheese-factor make this a Vegas must."

Neon Lights and plush decor followed by a tree in the middle of the dining area, only in Vegas baby!\n\nOur first stop was this place straight from the airport. My friend went for the usual - scrambled eggs, sausage and home fries. I've never had it so I tried the southern fried steak and eggs. All I can say is that it's perfect drunk food. Filling, heavy and the steak looked like mystery meat lol. Huge portions. \n\nGreat diner that's open 24/7. Oh and I saw Paul Pierce here."

Service was a little disappointing, but not so bad to kill this review. My wife and I went on a Friday close to 11:20am. We were told it would be about 20-25 minutes until a table was ready; we were invited to wait inside the Fireside Lounge.\n\nMy wife and I don't drink but LOVED the atmosphere in the Fireside Lounge. We literally sat fireside, watching the atmosphere, looking over the menu, this is where I discovered that Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis had dined at The Peppermill. Personally I think that's cool. As if it were on cue, our table was ready in 20-25 minutes.\n\nAs we sat, at our booth, Hope you like booth seating. Unless you are at bar we will be seated in a booth! Our server arrived soon after. We were overlooking the menu still as the waitress took our drink orders. When she returned we still needed time to decide. Our waitress said \"I'll be back\" as if our not ordering yet was an inconvenience for her. \n\nThe food was fine. Typical diner like fare. We had mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. I ate a  Philly Cheese Steak, Savory u.s.d.a. choice beef strips flash - saut\u00e9ed with strips of onion, bell peppers, sliced tomato and smothered with provolone on a grilled steak roll. My wife ate what was called, Conquest, Combination of roast beef, cheddar cheese, tomato, saut\u00e9ed peppers, onions, mushrooms, thousand island dressing and bacon, served on grilled parmesan sourdough. The meal reminded me a lot of eating at a diner like Denny's. When I mentioned this to my wife she fully agreed. \n\nAs we were eating, a lady with camera walked by and asked if we would like to pose for a souvenir picture. We agreed.The lady with camera said she would return as soon as we were done with out meals. But alas she never returned.\nThe meal was all but over. My plate was empty; my wife still had a few onion rings on her plate. Our waitress came by and asked how we enjoyed our meals. As we were answering, she took the plates, without asking if my wife wanted those remaining onion rings.\n\nWELL KISS MY GRITS!\n\nAs we were leaving we walked right by that lady with a camera, who never returned to take out picture."

The waitresses and cocktail waitress are dressed up in true diner style. The menu had a wide variety of food and from the things that my party ordered, all of it was delicious. The mushroom dish that came with the steak was phenomenal. \n\nThe Peppermill also has incredibly large portions for the price you pay. If you ask for a side of fries, its in a huge bowl instead of a small plate. Although I did not drink any other their drinks they had a huge drink menu that looked great and all of them came with a scoop of real ice cream. I will have to try it the next time."

You start off betting 25 cents on video poker and you stick a dollar in the slot so you can play 4 times.  You always get dealt 15 or 16 which is super boring, what do you do?  Hit and probbaly bust or not hit and probably definitely lose?  Anyway at some point you'll realize that if you bet 50 cents you can win more if you actually win and get up to $3.50.  Then you get cocky and bet a dollar twice and your money is gone.\n\nAnyway I liked the Fireside Lunge.  There is a fountain in there with a real fire coming out of the middle of the water, you can sit around it and watch the TV screens which are plentiful and playing football, basketball (hoops) and some music videos, good ones like 80s and Roy Orbison.  That puts you in a good mood.  The lights are really bright blue and red.  Neon, with reflective surfaces and free nuts.  I had an \"Amstel Light\" for $5.50 which was depressing, lost $2 gambling and left.  But no one bothered me and you could just waste a lot of time in there I think.  The bartender was REALLY NICE and there are all these fancy dressed up waitresses with their ass and titties hangin' out all over the place.  A good first stop.  Across the street you can get a souvenir  or go McDonalds or do \"indoor skydiving\" and for all of these reasons, overall I would recommend the Peppermill Restaurant, specifically the fireside lounge.  Make sure you are not wearing your gang colors or a ripped shirt though!!!"

That's always a good sign - a place has to be good if there are so many people willing to wait for the first meal of the day! Fortunately, there were a couple of seats available at the counter, and we asked the hostess if there was a queue for that. Nope!! So we just walked straight in and it was the most awesome feeling in the world - jumping a queue of about 30. Haha\n\nAnyways, on to the food. GIANT portion sizes. I am a ravenous beast in the morning, and I could only make through half of my Marco Pollo Omelet and the monster portion of hash browns. My husband ordered the french toast, and got 3 (or was it 4?) huge slices with a mound of fruit on top. The food was not uniquely delicious, but it was satisfying. All in all, we left happy and content.\n\nWe will definitely return whenever we visit the sin city next!"

The Clarion was once the Debbie Reynolds, WWF, Paddle wheel casinos. Now,  it's rubble. Tacos Del gordo was THE PLACE for an arm-sized burrito and super fresh tacos. Now it's an empty store. Further proving that the SLS Is dead wrong by telling us that \"North is the new South \". (that's a truly a DUMB idea. As is the idea of the SLS itself.  Enjoy it now,  I say it's closed by '19) Next month another classic is done. The Riviera sadly closes.  The landscape changes again. Between the quality going down, prices going the other direction and the fact that some of the local residents of the 4-legged variety have been seen nearby.  I wouldn't send anyone to go there.  I used to LOVE the open hearth of the Fireside.  But I have to admit,  I'll never go again."

We also shared a banana split which came complete with chocolate syrup, peanuts, and cherries.  Again, nothing special but it was exactly what you picture when you think of a banana split.

When we walked in, I couldn't decide if I was looking at a scene from National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation or a Tarantino film.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor was straight from the 70s with fake hanging plants and booths wrapped in hot pink and blue neon lights (hence the strip club feel).  The patrons were equally colorful on a weekday morning.\n\nThe food was good old Americana. Huge portions and decent prices. $11.50 for 3 eggs, 3 big sausage links, really crispy tasty hash browns, and toast. Coffee mugs were latte size, so you didn't have to wait around for a refill (a plus if you're a caffeine addict like me) which was good because although the server was friendly, she rarely stopped to check on us. Our table was the only table that didn't have regular sugar packets, which we didn't notice that until AFTER we used what we assumed was sugar from the container on the table. It was sugary (red, white, blue pellets) and left a candy like floaties in my coffee. I kept waiting for the hallucinations to start, but ultimately no harm done. \n\nOverall, it's nothing spectacular, but I love finding new spots and taking in the local color (neon and all). Worth a stop if you're hungry and  on that end of the strip."

The ambiance of this restaurant is actually pretty cool the neon lights late at night make it seem really cool inside and out. The staff was very friendly and suggestive as to what type of burger I should get let's just say I wasn't disappointed all the food was really good. Moderate price range.

However, the last day, our waitress kept saying she would send the cocktail waitress but she never came. She finally came when we were almost done with our meal but wasn't really worth it to get a drink then. Not sure if that's always a problem, but it's just a bit odd."

For $13.50 you get a lot of food. I'm partial to the omelets, which are huge and come with a hefty portion of hash browns and toast/muffins. My two favorites are the Maserati and the Marco Pollo. \n\nThe hash browns are thicker than any I've ever had. It actually feels like I'm eating pure potatoes--not overly buttered ones.\n\nThis place has the classic diner feel, but better food and heartier portions. It's pretty packed, even in the graveyard hours.

I'm vegetarian, so I'm limited to begin with; and I'm kind of a health nut, so that limits me further.

On the other hand, the waffles with fruit are SO GOOD.  I haven't tried the pancakes, but plan to next time I'm there.  I haven't tried any of the dinner options (not many options there for vegetarians), but if you like having breakfast anytime, this place is open 24/7 and serves breakfast items all day and all night.  It's a handy place to come if it's midnight and you're starving!\n\nThe cool atmosphere is why you come here, essentially.

Cocktail waitress frequented a couple times to make sure we didn't want anything. Friendly not pushy. Waitress was friendly and very attentive. Filled drinks right away.  Noticed without asking that we were out of regular sugar packs. My eggs were waaay over runny and I had to send them back.  She was very apologetic.  The manager brought my eggs back perfect and also apologized.  She said she personally sent them back twice for me because they cooks didn't get them right to get liking. Wow. Judy wow. That is personal attention.\nSpeaking of food,  our was great.  My meal was super simple (eggs, sausage & hash browns). Was good.  Hash browns are ribbon style and fresh. But my hubby ordered chicken fried steak. It was really, really good! Huge and cooked perfectly.  Not chewy. Yummy gravy that tasted like sausage. The portions are enormous!

Note - this place is not for those who like new, modern, high-end things. You will not find the Peppermill sexy if you don't like a little grittiness.

However, having a male employee open the door and ask you to hurry up is unsettling and was an unpleasant experience. \n\nPeggy then proceeded to tell me that he couldn't have said that to me because, \"he doesn't even speak English\". I responded by stating he knew enough to stay that. I can excuse the way he said that, knowing that there was in fact a language barrier. That's fine, I am not saying anything poor in regards to his work ethic. It's hard to work somewhere where the predominant language is not your own. \n\nHowever, to be told he didn't say that to me, is condescending, unprofessional and rude. A manager should never speak that way to a guest and they definitely should not end the conversation, which was civil (I wasn't yelling or making a scene, I was simply telling her it was an off putting encounter), by then walking away without another word. \n\nIt wasn't busy. At that time, there was only one couple waiting to be seated. If I was the owner, this woman would never be representing their establishment.

I decided to go today for a different breakfast place.\n\nI arrived about 9:45 and the place was packed.  There was a waiting list for a table, but the counter was open so I went there.  Angela was my server and she immediately got me some coffee.  I have read about the big portions.  It starts with their over-sized coffee mugs.  Very nice.\n\nI ordered the Fruit fantasia waffle, a good sized waffle topped with seasonal fresh fruit and served with boysenberry syrup and butter and whipped cream or sour cream for a topping.  The waffle had a lot of fruit--bananas, grapes, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and strawberries.  It was excellent.\n\nThis is an institution that has been around for a lot of years and based on the people there today, it will be around for a lot more."

Second day had the Pastrami burger. Also amazing. We wanted to come back to the lounge later but we had so much planned, we didn't have much time. Only thing is that the service was a bit slow on the second day when we sat at the breakfast bar. Otherwise, awesome!"

It seems to be pretty packed constantly but the wait for two people isn't bad if you're open to sitting at the bar. The day time and night time waitresses wear different outfits and it's all very \"Alice in Wonderland\" (I'm assuming that's what they're going for). All in all pretty cool with a good group of staff that gets things out decently quick. They have different servers for food and alcohol though which was weird (who wants to tip twice in a meal...?) but we definitely liked it."

The decor is so kitchy and kooky it is just entertaining in itself. The walls and ceilings are covered with mirrors, there is a lot of pink neon happening and there are these big fake cherry trees. They also have a great lounge complete with an indoor fire pit. Their food is typical diner fair, but amped up a bit. Unless you are really hungry and can put away some serious food, splitting an entree is probably just fine. They have got great Reubens, burgers and breakfast. My husband had the California omlette that was so big, he ate half, then we both split the other half for breakfast the next morning. They also have your basic cocktail menu, that you order from your cocktail waitress. This has become a must when we go to Vegas!"

After any buffet, Egg Works, and Hash House were all shot down for having too large of portion sizes, I finally sold them on the Peppermill, largely by promising them neon.\n\nPros: \n - Damn tasty diner food and freely flowing cups of coffee. This is all I really ask for in a solid Brunch Experience\n-Super friendly staff and prompt service, and no problems with slightly different orders and keeping coffee coming.\n- The look on my friends' faces when they realized this place didn't have small portions either! Oh noes, mah dietz. I laughed and laughed and laughed/\n\nCons:\n- Long wait, really with no where to sit and wait. We hung out on a curb and were frequently asked if we needed a cab.\n- Prices were a bit on the high side relative to the awesomeness of the food. Got the impression I was paying for the neon. Wasn't too bad, but also nothing to compose a sonnet over.\n\nOverall Verdict:\n- Yummy classic diner food in a classically vegas atmosphere. Will return when hungover, or with out of town and unadventurous guests. Won't be on the favorites anytime list, but certainly not shabby."

I love the 50's diner look from the outside, the massive portions of virtually anything you can chow down either at a table or at the counter in the restaurant. Nachos are great, huge and perfect for that: \"it's 4am and I need food, stat\" moment; best shared with a friend or 12. Breakfast foods are equally large portions: pancake lovers rave over their stacks; many of my burger loving friends have raved about the burgers. I usually have a gynormous salad, while iceberg isn't my favorite, it is more than adequate here (I never leave without a to-go box) Love that they are open 24/7 and the kitschy decor in the diner. There can be relatively long waits during breakfast hours and at seemingly random times. Worth the wait. Also, it is easy walking distance from many spots on the Strip, so you can walk off some of those drinks/nachos. Recently walked from TI & Bellagio. \n\nJust the diner side would make this great to this NYer who misses a diner. But then...you walk into the Fireside Lounge and are transported into the 1970's (overheard a man telling his wife \"it looks like a den of iniquity\")  Velvet couches in the round with flat screens playing old school videos, plus the famous floating fireplace add to the unique ambience; there are even matchbooks at your tables. There are gaming spots at bar, if that's your thing. \n\nDrinks follow the throwback theme along with Mai Tais, Scorpions & other \"Girl Drink Drunk\" offerings (check out classic Kids in the Hall skit on You Tube, riff on Days of Wine and Roses but very Vegas) and unique dessert themed libations. There's frequently a roving photographer to present a memento of what always turns out to be a good time for local and tourists alike. \n\nThe waitresses wear long black cocktail dresses, and do the classic \"Bunny dip\" to place coasters and serve -- reminiscent of the old Playboy Clubs -- there's a decent array of  bar food and appetizers. On my last trip in April we had Caprese Salad (very good) Shrimp Cocktail (a ok) Chicken Quesadillas (really good, very flaky but took forever to come out) and something else I didn't eat but my friend enjoyed it. Drinks are potent, service can be a tad slow, but friendly. Our water glasses were always filled, drinks refreshed and waitress did keep in touch regarding wayward item. \n\nThe people watching alone is worth a visit. Depending on what time you are there, you'll start to see hungry clubbers, hungry/thirsty \"dancers \" and just your variety of only-in-Vegas sightings. From about 3AM on it gets really shall we say, eclectic?' \n\nSo, I'm a fan. Always have been, always will be. It is a cool spot to chow down, get your drink on or snuggle up to your honey. Long live The Peppermill!"

Who was nice enough to give me the same look on the way out. We decided to have a couple drinks in the fireside lounge area. Found a nice place to sit, sat down and got comfy. We were quickly greeted by our server who was very nice and helpful in helping us out with our drinks. Since I had eaten prior to stopping in, I was just there for drinks and dessert. The host person and our server were both helpful with informing us that only drinks and appetizers are available in the fireside lounge area. No problem so we could have a few drinks and then head to the cafe since the dessert is over the there. \n\n   After we finish our drinks  we head on over to the cafe area. My girlfriend could barely walk so we were both surprised that we were seated as far away from the front door and restroom as possible. No complaints from us we sit down and order. She has the gyro with onion rings and a side of ranch and I order the colossal sundae with chocolate syrup.  \n    Our food is brought out and to my surprise they used hot fudge on my sundae instead of the chocolate syrup that I ordered. I know how rich the hot fudge is and it melts the ice cream which is what I was trying to avoid.  I was informed it was large and that the banana split was 8 scoops. That sounded like too much so i went with the colossal sundae. \n   Let me tell you the only thing colossal about my colossal sundae was the colossal amount of hot fudge underneath my 2 scoops and frozen puddle of mush. Probably melted from the hot fudge which i didn't order.  I didn't take a picture but imagine like 2 cups of warm fudge on the bottom. Just gross. \n\n So its time to pay, her gyro was fine by the way. We ask for the check after trying very hard to get ahold of our server. We get the bill and another 10 mins goes by waiting for our server to take my card. She only came back after hollering at other staff.  She takes my card and returns with only the receipt. I realize instantly my card is missing , but our server had already skipped off. I go to the restroom when i come back I'm greeted by someone making me show proof of identification to get my card back. I understand they do this sort of thing however i was displeased that our server wasn't capable of just returning my card herself. \n    What a mess at what was supposed to be a special occasion."

However, our friends were at the Riviera and said they had heard Peppermill was pretty good. So we actually came here twice. The first time was the first night that we were there, and the second time was for breakfast the day before we left. Both times there were a decent amount of people there, but we only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated.\n\nService overall left a little to be desired. But I mean, what can you really expect? We only were on the restaurant side, although we heard good things about the lounge side of the place. Definitely a diner type feel to this place and whatever you get, underestimate what you can eat because everything is MASSIVE. Two people could easily split most of their plates.\n\nOne time I got the Feta Cheese and Vegetable Omelet, which was huge. It came with an English muffin (or toast or whatever) and potatoes, and I definitely couldn't finish everything. The other time I got the Pancake Combo which included pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausage. The pancakes were like 8 inches in diameter! One of our friends just got the pancakes (not combo) and they were literally a foot across. I mean, massive. Everything tasted really good, no complaints about any of the food. This is definitely a legit option for any time of the day (open 24 hours of course) although I have heard that it gets really busy around breakfast/brunch time."

Neon lights and indoor fake trees aren't something you find everywhere.  The menu is vast and there's something for everyone.  Here's the thing...PORTIONS ARE HUGE!!!.  I ordered the Denver omlette.  When it arrived, I couldn't believe my eyes.  I asked the server how many eggs they put in it, she told me 8-10!  I use that many eggs to feed my family of 4  at a typical breakfast!  The food was good, but nothing extrordinary.  At a table adjacent to ours, we saw them deliver a fruit salad...it included an whole pineapple.  This is definitely the place to come if you are really hungry.  The disappointing thing was that the food wasn't that cheap.  Lunch for four of us was about $80.  Could have had an all-you-can eat buffet for that price.  Service was so-so.  Glad we checked it out, not sure we'd go back though."

If it's not busy you can get a seat right infront of the fire. If not, it's not so bad either, you can curl up on the couches and watch random music videos while nursing a bloody mary all night.\n\nIn the restaurant, the girls are dressed like Hooters girls, in the lounge they're dressed like prom queens in full on gowns. With that said, the lounge is NOT fancy, it's just a cool place to drink and be comfortable.\n\nAgain, still love the Peppermill and I'll probably come back here every time I visit Vegas."

Cocktail prices are similar to all bars / casinos on the strip though I noticed a considerable difference in the portions sizes. One example would be the nearly triple shot premium bloody mary I ordered was taller and stronger than any restaurant I previously ordered from that week. Additionally, the rum & coke I ordered was considerably larger and a lot more affordable. I do also appreciate the lounges efforts to maintain a consistent appearance from its patrons (e.g. no hats inside the lounge). \n\nInside the diner there is a multitude of options listed on their menu, my choice was the mediterranean omelet. Being very fond of seafood, I was pleasantly surprised to see a giant omelette with crab / shrimp topped with Old Bay hollandaise sauce listed on the menu. The omelet itself is not for the faint of heart or small stomached! This TEN egg omelet (which I wasn't aware of until it was brought to our attention after I nearly ate the whole thing) was packed with micro shrimp and some crab meat, but was the most fluffy omelet I've ever ate. \n\nThe customer service was quick, fast and friendly - 4 stars."

Though the times and the menu have changed a bit over the years, the atmosphere of the place has remained pretty much the same. \n\nThe menu changing is actually a good thing. The portion of the food have diminished somewhat, which makes their meals much more manageable. They used to be so large that you were almost forced to eat too much.

Most of our group struggled to finish their meals, but a long day of competition worked wonders on my appetite. That mushroom burger didn't stand a chance.  And the milkshakes? GINORMOUS. In general, I'd say food quality is mediocre, but they give you such a large quantity that I feel most people would be inclined to take half of it home. (I love leftovers) Also, for those of you who are into the brekky-for-dinner thing, breakfast is served all day long. \n\nAdditional bonus: our server was so nice to separate all the orders onto separate checks despite the fact that we presented her with a 20-person group.

So I had alot of time to review the extensive menu which covers pretty much the full gamet of what you'd find at a Dennys (Breakfast, Sandwhiches, steaks, fish, burgers, deserts & Full Bar) but more Upscale.\n\nI had also viewed several Youtube videos, one which featured the Mammoth \"SCORPION\" Cocktail ($20) & that pretty much sealed the deal on what I was going to have to drink. The Scorpion came just as it was shown on the vid and was very good wt no hint of any liquor at all which was strange because if you look up the recipe its loaded with alcohol. I am a vodka drinker and I'm guessing it was the 151 in the mix that had me done drinking anything else & sweating bullets towards the end of the visit. It packs a punch.\n\nThe Bartender in the Fireside Lounge was very freindly & had a good sense of humor especially when I pretended to have poked my eye out on the long straw that came with the drink and demanded someone call Personal Injury Attorney Glenn Lerner. The Bartender immediatly offered up some scissors to cut the straws to a shorter more manageable length.My accomplice had a glass of White wine ($9.50).\n\nAfter conversation over our drinks and very hungry, we went into the main dining room and were immediatly seated in a nice out of the way booth in the back that was big enough for a group of 4 so we had pleanty of room to spread out and make ourselves comfortable.\n\nI ordered the 1/2 order of Nachos wt Chicken ($16) and my Partner in Crime had a salad, Shrimp, and steamed green beans ($20) which looked very good and she had no complaints. The Nachos on the other hand were somewhat of a dissappointment. I have definatly had better. The quantity was overwhelming & in fact wt my huge cocktail, could not finish them. My complaint was they had been covered wt white cheese & baked in the oven and the end result was a concrete textured layer covering them. Also there was very little sign of any chicken whatsoever, though we did find a few small pcs upon a close inspection.\n\n The Nacho's were served wt 2 small cups of sour cream, a chedder cheese sauce & salsa all on the side and was pretty sparse on the other ingredients advertised - tomatoes, blk olives, jalepenos & onions. My expectations were more of a zesty, loose array of all advertised ingredients as I am accustomed  Sort of like a Taco Salad, where one can build each chip as an individual h'orderve. The concrete texture, as well as the limited ingredients, prevented this. Still it was good, but I wouldnt order it again.\n\nThe waitress, overall atmospere & company was very nice and based on my experience I would have no problem going back, or reccommending it to others. Go to youtube and see the various vids there. The breakfast dishes look very good as do the burgers. 3 out of 5."

Their hash browns are great too, and they use real potatoes!  And I like that they use shredded potatoes that they griddle the heck out of, because I like my hash browns crispy.  And for those that want/need a drink in the morning, maybe to recover from the night before, they have a full bar from the lounge next door that you can order from.

I saw some and they were ginormous! 10-12 eggs?!\n\nI ordered the NY steak and eggs- so good! So much food. \n\nThe rainbow sprinkles were super cute! If I'd gotten any sort of sweet dish, I would definitely have poured that on my dish!"

I mean, who doesn't want the Bourdain experience?! \n\nSo after an already long night of drinking, eating and more drinking my girlfriend and I hopped in a cab and ended up here and I'm glad we did! We didn't eat here but we did share a Scorpion. A tropical drink concoction that was the cap for the night! What is in it you ask? I'm not sure about everything but there is some pineapple and LOTS OF BOOZE...oh yeah and ICE CREAM! I don't think you will find it on the menu but you can order it. \n\nIt's a cool throwback to old Vegas that includes an awesome lounge, fire pits and a mirrored ceiling! It's got tons of character and has become a 'must go to' spot for me anytime I will find myself in Las Vegas. Yes, it is over the top and cheesy but Vegas is all about excess anyways!"

Not only are the portions huge, but the food is surprisingly very good.  I've only had breakfast items both times I was here, but It's much better quality ingredients and better taste than any other breakfast place or diner I've been.  Both times, I've had a omelete and they were delicious.  I even opted for egg whites which they'll happily substitute for a slight up charge.\n\nI plan on coming back soon to try their salads and dessert-inspired cocktails that they are known for."

I was in the hunt for a brunch type restaurant that serves good bloody marys and Peppermill did not disappoint. This review is for the Fireside Lounge.\n\nAmbience: \nAs other reviewers have mentioned, the pink and blue neon lights give it a divey, strip club-esque vibe which I totally loved. There's a firepit in the center of the lounge area, complete with comfy seating and overhead TVs. There are several other TVs throughout the lounge. It's quiet, yet not awkward, perfect for the invariable hangover headache. Another plus: they're open 24 hours, so you *really* have no excuse.\n\nStaff: \nThe bartender was great, I wish I could remember her name. Very friendly, sincere and prompt. \n\nFood: \nThe Fireside Lounge only offers food from the appetizer menu. I ordered the shrimp cocktail ($12.95) and a bloody mary (~$7). The bloody mary was definitely tasty, came garnished with a cherry tomato, a cucumber slice and a celery stick. I asked for olives and the bartender obliged. The shrimp cocktail came with 6 large jumbo shrimp, cocktail sauce, and what appeared to be shredded cabbage buried beneath the cocktail sauce. While the shrimp tasted great, they were a bit chewy/tough and may have been frozen a little too long. Also, I don't know that I would pay $13 for shrimp cocktail again.\n\nAll in all, the Fireside Lounge was the start to a perfect Vegas morning (if 1:15PM counts as morning when you're hungover)."

When I was a kid, my dad and all his guy friends would meet for breakfast at the Peppermill the first or last Saturday of the month. It was my first experience of being out with the guys, feeling cool and I wish I could bring back those days. \n\nI'm here to say that it hasn't changed all that much. The waitresses are still wearing shiny nylons, but they are a lot younger than I remember, which is definitely a good thing. The food is good, the portion sizes are GIANT and you could easily order breakfast and share it with another friend or significant other. \n\nThe service here was very good. Coffee cups were never empty, our waitress checked with us numerous times throughout the meal and they even had a cute gal come around and take your picture, which obviously means she comes back 12 minutes later while you have hash browns and eggs all over yourself asking \"Wanna buy your photos? 2 for $29.99 or one for $14.50.\") That's not such a bargain hun.\n\nPeppermill is a much better option that the hotel buffet, which at the Wynn (where we always stay) would have been roughly $35 a piece."

They have fantastic wings and there not way the hell over priced like at the Bellagio cafe. \n    I love the decor as well, The neon is great, and the tree running all over the place is nice also. My only complaint, the damn booths are for tinny people! Im not a small guy and I have a hell of a time fitting into any of the booths. This is the country with the fat people remember?

It's more or less a classic diner, but then in the back there is a fire pit built into the table that we sat at which was different and provided for a beautiful ambiance. Sitting at the table and sipping our drinks was very relaxing and there were many people here on dates or catching up with a friend. The waitresses wore long black dresses which seemed elegant, classic and I thought was interesting. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with the menu. I ordered a chocolate chip martini which was delicious, but I expected it to be a bit more flavorful. My friend ordered a frozen Scooby Doo martini which she did not really enjoy. We shared the appetizer sampler which was huge. It came with breaded chicken, fried shrimp, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings. The food was OK, nothing too crazy. Best items were the mozzarella sticks and the chicken. After about two pieces of food each, we both began to feel very sick and nauseous so we didn't even finish our food. \n\nRating this place a four because I thought my drink was good and the atmosphere is just unrivaled and different. Good place to grab a drink and order a lot of food! Open 24 hours which is really awesome!"

Sorta fun to see, once.  I miss the old coffee shop in the Mirage.  They closed it in 08, I think.  We tried the TI coffee shop, NOT the same thing.  Planning to try the new one in Aria, next week.

But it took an Additional 30 minutes for them to ready our tables we we got there. Upon asking about the delay about 15 minutes in, they let us know that 1 table had been cleared but they were waiting on a second due to our group size. Understandable.\n\nHowever, this wasn't wasted time since we all crowded into their beautiful Fireside Lounge for drinks.\n\nWhat to choose?\n\nAfter reading fellow Yelper reviews, I was focused on trying two things:\n1. The Scorpion 2. The Chicken Fried Steak\n\nThe Scorpion was a massive reddish-orange-pink monster. It created an instant buzz: What the heck is that? Can I try that? The double-length foursome of straws were like something out of \"A Christmas Story.\" All I could hear repeated in the back of my head was \"You're gonna poke your eye out!\" Instant Photo Opportunity. Being Las Vegas we were able to transport it (slowly) from the Fireside Lounge to the Restaurant area for our meal.\n\nGood sweet Mai Tai flavor. You couldn't taste the alcohol.\n\nP.S. The server let us know that you can keep the Scorpion's cup (Known as a \"Fishbowl\") as a memento for an additional five dollars.\n\nTime to do some eating!\n\nPortions were very large. Great for sharing.\n\nThe Southern Chicken-Fried Steak was amazing. Well-breaded. So flavorful. Meaty. Crispy. The kind of food you add to your \"crave\" list. 5/5\n\nThe over-easy eggs were fluffy and delightful. 4/5\n\nThe hash browns were a disappointment. Kind of soft and mushy. Next time (and there will DEFINITELY be a next time) I will have to ask for them extra-crispy. 2/5\n\nThe \"Can I try a bite of that? Oooh Yum!\" List: Their Eggs Benedict 4/5 and also their Pancakes 4/5. I probably would have asked for more samples if I wasn't so happily focused on my Chicken-Fried Steak.\n\nKind of difficult to get a server since it was so crazy-busy for the holiday. Servers were very nice and attentive once you flagged one down.\n\nThis is now one of my must-eat Las Vegas destinations. Yum.\n\nSincerely, Michael"

I have no doubt that if I had had a heavy night of drinking I would have probably appreciated this place a lot more, even though I found it quite good.  The enormous cup of coffee set in front of my partner was setting the bar for what was to come.  The service was a bit quick and abrupt, my partner actually made a comment about trying to find something a little less filling and I think the waitress said something like, \"Well this is all we got\" or something to that nature, but it was more along the lines of funny than it was rude.  I had the Eggs Benedict and he had the Ham and Eggs, note that every item on the menu comes with at LEAST 3 eggs.  Our food did take quite a while, but as I said, it was Sunday Brunch time and the place was packed with a line out the door.  When our food arrived it was hysterical.  My Benedict was enormous, 3 eggs spread across 2 english muffins, and the rest of my plate was covered in a thick delicious layer of hash browns,  Eggs were fluffy and light.  My partner, wow, if I could paint you a picture of how much food was on his plate...  Ok this slice of grilled ham was so large that the plate was literally layered with food instead of spaced across the plate.  The under layer, hashbrowns, above that a huge slice of ham even with the bone, and then the 3 eggs on top.  It was quite entertaining watching him attempt to eat what he could so he didn't feel like he was wasting food.  I will note that our waitress took a drink off our bill for the wait even though we never said a word and we were quite happy to enjoy each others company, so they are certainly not the kind of place that sees being busy as an excuse for not exceeding customer service.  Make sure you are hungry if you are headed here!  This is no place for snacking!"

There used to be a Peppermill in Cupertino when I was younger and we frequented the establishment. Clearly, Cupertino was not a good fit for this type of restaurant but Vegas is just perfect!\n\nOn Saturday, we stopped by for brunch. We got there around noon and had to wait more than half an hour to get seated.  I ordered the burger (because I don't eat eggs) but quite a few people in my party ordered breakfast items.  Everyone (except one person) loved the food.  The portion size is huge!  \n\nHowever, you have to be aware that a lot of shady things have occurred in those booths over the years so don't get too comfortable in there.  Also, the crowd is really mixed - from overweight chicks in tiny shorts to Asian gangsters to local families."

Ordered the nachos, chicken tenders, and the chicken fried steak and eggs. Nachos are sort of deconstructed. The beans and meat come on the side. They were a huge portion, good amount of cheese. I'd rate them 3, though. I come from a state that has good Mexican food, so they are just ok.  The chicken tenders...you get 4 and they are wide and flat. Big portion. Huge portion of fries come with it. Steak and eggs also good. It's a sausage gravy on the steak...and it's very sausage-y. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Chicken fried steak tasted pre-battered, but still good. Service was good as well. You have 3 servers...one takes your nonalcoholic order, one does alcohol only, and the other takes your food order and refills nonalcoholic bevs. Interesting place. I definitely recommend checking it out!"

I wasn't really impressed with the meal at all. Salad was terrible, baked potato dry and old and the mushrooms were disgusting (I love mushrooms btw). The steak was the only thing that kept me from returning the meal. You can easily find steak dinners all around Vegas for under $10. They probably have better choices on their menu but I advise you not to order a steak dinner here. Herbs and Rye off Sahara can fill that void if you feel like splurging on a proper steak.

Upon entering, I was a bit surprised. From the outside it doesn't really look like much but once you step in, it's like entering a different world. \n\nThe inside was really cool because everything was bright and colorful, yet still had a dimly-lit feeling. The bright neon lights and the light above our table didn't make it seem as dark as it felt. I really dig the ambience to this place. \n\nI ordered the pork loin and eggs. The dish consisted of 4 pan-fried pork cutlets, hash browns, your choice of toast, and 3 eggs of any style (I went with poached eggs). The pork loin was soft and tender. I'm sometimes hesitant to order pork dishes (especially pan-fried pork loin) because they run the risk of being hard, dry, and unappealing. The way the chefs cooked the pork here made the pieces easy to cut, and retain most of the natural juices and flavor. Bravo!\n\nThe hash brown shreds are bigger in size than most places that serve similar diner food. The poached eggs were alright, and is best eaten with the sourdough toast.\n\nThis is probably one of the places you should visit if you're ever on the north end of the Strip. Come for the unique ambience, but definitely stay for the great tasting food!"

She said she'd bring more because that's all they had. My bf said \"Well, I ordered onion rings anyway...\" She never brought more fries or onion rings.

The Peppermill of course!\n\nThis is a place that serves as a fond memory from childhood from me. I remember going with my mom or my grandparents to meet up with my aunt when she worked at the Stardust (now long gone). Many times we would come here for breakfast. The Stardust is a childhood memory that I feel was taken from me. But this place still remains.\n\nAs an adult, I love the Peppermill more than ever. Price-wise, it isn't the cheapest. It's pretty much an upscale version of a diner though, so that can be forgiven, especially considering how large the portions are. Last time I went, I had chicken fingers with fries. I received four chicken fingers and could only finish two of them before I was stuffed. And that was on the appetizer menu, mind you. I fondly remember the breakfast platters from when I was a kid, and while I haven't ordered one in a while, they always look like something to die for. Memo: get one of those next time. \n\nAnother thing I remember always being curious about as a kid was the lounge. I would stomp my feet, demanding to see it. Everyone always talked about how beautiful it was and I was never allowed to check it out. Wahh wahh wahh!!! Haha. Well, I'm legal now, and actually can spend time in there. And yes, it was worth the hype. It's intimate and quite lovely, albeit in the campiest way possible with the fake trees, gold barricades and 70s-style pink tube lighting. Alas, even without a date it's worth it to spend an hour or two in there if only for the ambiance. Don't worry, no one will look at you funny. \n\nThe Peppermill is quite the oddity on The Strip, a borderline mystery even. As it's immediate surroundings become increasingly desolate, not only does it continue to stand but every time you go in the place, it's still packed. You're lucky if you're even able to grab a seat at the diner. A strange happening indeed. Not that I'm one to complain. \n\nThe Final Verdict\n\nPros:\nVegas classic.\nRetro vibe and feel.\nBeautiful lounge.\nHuge portions. \n\nCons:\nNot the cheapest food, but the portions make up for that.\nNot the cheapest drinks, but the ambiance makes up for that.\nCan feel a little bit campy, but it works.\n\nReturn Factor: 10/10.

I learned about it by watching a \"Holly's World\" episode but the more I mentioned it to friends, I realized I was out of the loop about this awesome spot! You could come here for any meal. I've enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant, drinks & appetizers in the lounge, and dinner in the lounge. It just depends on your mood. It's a kitschy vibe and reminds me of the Madonna Inn Hotel in San Luis Obispo so if you've ever been there I'd compare the two in terms of d\u00e9cor and vibe. The lounge is totally different - kind retro and I can't even tell you how much I love the fire/water features. I could probably hang out in there all day! I'd suggest you make a stop in there at some point on your Vegas visit!"

We sat in the bar area of the restaurant called the Fireside Lounge. \n\nThe drinks are cheap, the vibe is laid back and the nacho appetizer is a mountain of deliciousness. I dare you to finish it. The corn chips are layered with cheese, jalape\u00f1o, tomato, onion and black olive and came with a plate of ground beef and a plate of refried beans mixed with a nacho cheese.

It was the night before my wedding. Our props were impressive--a set of hillbilly teeth fabricated by my friend's orthodontic stepdad, bolas, dreds and curly blond wigs. These luxurious party materials, and the classic Vegas setting of Fireside lounge, set the stage for a full evening of bacchanalia that (we thought) would leave us too tired to party like rock stars the following evening for the main event. If anything, it fueled the fire.\n\nI go to Fireside lounge to enjoy its big red booths and to sit and mingle. Many a fun nights start or finish at this strip location. The free nuts can partially undo a spontaneous alcohol binge. \n\nUnfortunately Fireside installed TVs in all the booths a few years ago, which diminishes its classic and intimate appeal. Why turn the fireside lounge into a showcase for music videos? That's why I can't give it five stars. \n\nStill, Fireside is a must-see Vegas attraction."

The inside looks like a limo/ party bus... appropriate for Vegas. Cocktail waitresses were friendly; drinks didn't taste like there was any alcohol tho. \nOne star for unique atmosphere. \n\nAfter an hour, I approached the hostess about how much longer & she said \"We're just waiting for tables to get up\" & no apology, which pissed me off. If I've waited way past the amount of time you told me I needed to wait, at least take 2 seconds out of the time your getting paid to stand there to apologize for your hosting skills. \n\nLiterally 1hr & 30 min later , 2x my quote time, we finally get sat! Then, we had to wait some more because it took 3 different people to get our meal started: 1 for basic drinks, 2nd for alcoholic drinks, 3rd for food. We kept hearing \"someone else will get that for you\", WTF. Then we happened to notice that another large party that sat after us got their food faster than us. We're angrier than hangry at this point! \n\nThe food: .. we ate it. Similar to Denny's. Second star for George (our server) for doing your job. \n\nPaying out: Two people of my party had to leave early so they tried to pay their tab at the cashier stand. The manager gave them a hard time because we all had to be there to pay out but the rest of us were still eating. Annoyed af, I got up there & split the check myself. I expressed to her how terrible of a time we were having and she had no comment. Didn't even take two seconds to say sorry or ask about what happened. She probably trained the girl at the host stand. \n\nPoor customer service for brunch."

When you're looking to bring an out-of-towner to a classic, old Vegas joint for a bite - you do the Peppermill. The portions are HUGE, the food is diner-y, and the staff's costumes are absurd. \n\nOn this occasion we over heard the hostess call another diner a 'dumb b*tch' to another staff member, and I was pretty disgusted. Not only should you never speak about a customer this way, there's no excuse for it to be done on the floor in front of other diners. Gross. I left a comment on the comment card at the table. \n\nThe french dip sandwich is so good that my husband gets it every time we go. I've tried some of the appetizers and the BLT - they are typical diner fare, so I'm still searching for my go-to meal at the Peppermill. The menu is arduous and nothing really pops out at you, because it's stuff you've seen before. I'm sure something will eventually tickle my tastebuds. \n\nAlong with the neon lights and indoor trees/garden - you'll find a container of sugar sprinkles on each table which is a lot of fun. I'm not quite sure why each table would need this at all times, but it helps to make Peppermill the Peppermill - and that's okay with me.\n\nA note about the 'in-house photographer': You do not have to purchase photos from them.

It seemed like we bothered her a bit at first because we kept moving around, but she warmed up to us in the end.  One of my friends knew the manager so she came by and helped us out too.  We didn't wait too long for anything, and we had an endless supply of beer nuts.  Everyone seemed pretty chill.  No need to impress or go above and beyond; just very casual and relaxed.  All the waitresses wore long \"gowns-could-be-a-homecoming-dress\".  I thought it was a nice touch.  I mean, why not right?\n\nThe goods:  I'm not a heavy drinker, I just had a couple beers.  There was a complaint that the beers weren't cold so the manager put some on ice for us before she brought them out.  I had a sip of my friend's margarita on the rocks and that was pretty tasty.  Another friend ordered nachos.  They weren't bad.  It was really dark, but I'm almost positive there was mozzarella cheese on them.  Different, but not bad.  I don't think many people come for the food, and if you do, you'll  probably be disappointed.  \n\nThe atmosphere: This is why Fireside has a reputation.  Firepit surrounded by water, bubbled by jets.  It's like Satan's jacuzzi.  We sat in the pit for a little bit, but there were quite a few of us so we ended up moving to a different booth.  The booths are comfortable, squishy, and I liked the throw pillows.  Lots of \"greenery\", helps make some of the booths more private.  I requested that we stay in a booth that was somewhat well lit and very public, Lord knows what happens in those private booths.  This is a pretty cool place, not pretentious at all.  We ended up swapping stories of previous visits to Fireside.  If you're skittish or conservative, I would recommend coming early in the evening or not at all.  This place gets pretty diverting in the late hours.  The pimps and their girls will come in and have their cocktails, and if you're lucky, there'll be a mild drug exchange going on in a booth next to you.  A lot of the transvestites frequent this joint too...I think because the lighting is almost nonexistent (jk).  They're really friendly, so be prepared to converse with strangers.  Every now and again some famous someone or other will drop in too.  Again, probably because of the lack of lighting, so they can enjoy some privacy.  There are TVs everywhere and we enjoyed the old-school to not so old-school music they played.  The Beach Boys are getting ollllllllllld, but still so lovable.  I think this is a place for an older crowd, but a fresh pup with an open mind could probably really enjoy it.\n\nWe went for my going away party and I'm not disappointed.  We had a good time and we didn't bother anyone with our volume.  I would recommend this place for a casual get-together, but not if you're looking for a sit down dinner.  If you just want a place to chill, relax and shoot the shit, Fireside Lounge is a good spot.  Just be aware of your location and understand that anything can happen.  I mean seriously, it's Vegas."

This place screams Vegas. \n\nI pieced together my meal, side of scrambled eggs, side of hash browns and a fruit platter. Portions were ridiculous. The eggs were freshly scrambled, the potatoes nice and crisp. A bottle of cholula on the table makes me happy, who needs tabasco?!?\n\nFriends all loved their meals. Giant stuffed feta cheese omelets and a big bowl of what looked to be everything in the kitchen scrambled and topped with fried eggs.

The fireside lounge has this 70s strip club kind of feel with its decor of red and dim lights. They have a multitude of drinks to choose from and you can go old school and get a White Russian or zombie. \n\nFinally when you get seated, they have both a regular menu, but really is more famous is there breakfast menu. By the way, this is as good as any Vegas buffet, because their portions are insane and much tastier. Had the Maserati omelette and I was in heaven. How often can you have italian with breakfast?

            "review": "Ahh the Peppermill, known for its 80's themed decor, with neon lights and colored sugar sprinkles. I have been to the Peppermill a couple times in the past few months only because I had friends in town. This isn't the type of place to hang out at often because it is pricey. The first time I was there for food, my friends and I were seated at a round half couch table in the back. It was very hard for me to get comfortable because the table is cemented to the ground so there is no way to get extra room. It was a snug fit. Next time I would ask to be sat at a table with chairs. Anyway to eat I ordered the chicken fingers platter, with fries, and my friends ordered a sandwich and french toast. The food came out quickly, they were not busy at all. I enjoyed my food, and my friends seemed to enjoy theirs as well. The portions were hearty and the price was reasonable.\n\nThe next time I had friends come to town, we stopped here to check out the Fireside Lounge and get some drinks. The lounge is inside the Peppermill on the left, and is for the 21+ crowd only. It has plenty of seating, as well as a fire pit with some comfy couches surrounding it. We sat around the pit, and ordered drinks from the happy hour menu. Dirty martini's were only $4.50 each, and we also ordered mozzarella sticks which were like $6 something. The drinks were very good, but the mozz stix sucked. The ranch was BOMB though. This definitely is not the place to make as your local watering hole, but it is cool to stop in once when friends are in town.\n\nOne thing to note is there are NO prices on the regular menu at all for drinks. They have a lot of speciality drinks, with different syrups and add-ins, but again NO pricing, so you have to assume they are $$$$. (The pricing is listed on the happy hour menu for food and drinks though.)"

There is always a wait, but they seem to get the food out fast to turn the tables quickly.\n\nI've never been inside a restaurant like this before.. It is like a diner mixed with a theme restaurant. I couldn't believe all the pink trees inside. Definitely fun and quirky.. Totally Vegas. The food portions are so huge. We shared an omelet and I was certian we wouldn't finish it all. But we powered through and I'm glad we did because it was very good. \n\nNot far from the strip and very reasonable prices, I would come again."

I can completely understand how, if you might have had one or nine cocktails, you would think the Peppermill was the shit. With bright neon lights, ginormous portions, and pretty quick service, it is a drinkers dream. I was charmed by the fake cherry trees and our friendly waitress.\n\nOur food, however, was gross. I had the eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was not hollandaise sauce, simply put. It was gray and was more like gravy. My English muffin was burnt and I didn't quite understand why I had three poached eggs. BFF had the Joe's Special, which sounded really delicious. We fought over who would order it. It was a mix of scrambled eggs, sausage, some veggies, served over potato skins, with cheese sauce. Sounds delish, but wasn't. The potato skins were just boiled potato chunks and the cheese sauce was bright orange. There was nothing real about that cheese sauce. \n\nFor our two meals and two sodas, it was $36.

Well, Peppermill would be the love child.\n\nThis casual dining restaurant on the north end of the Strip between the Riviera and Encore/Wynn is... kinda strange when it comes to decor.\n\nThe place is super dark, with black floor to ceiling and then neon blue and pink lights accenting just about everything. I was uncertain about actually eating here because the decor just does not evoke the kind of restaurant it actually is.\n\nAs for the food, it's definitely above average, family restaurant fare. Lots of breakfast items available all day long, plus a long list of sandwiches and the like. I treated myself to a plate of nachos as an entree since I had been craving them all week. They were among the better I've had, with real melted cheese on top, although they did go a bit overboard with the beef. The people from my conference I was with seemed to enjoy their cheesesteak and burger as well. It probably won't be the best you've ever eaten, especially if you're from a bigger city, but it's pretty darn good.\n\nThe service wasn't so spectacular. Our waitress wasn't very attentive and had this attitude about her that wasn't so much pleasantly refreshing as it was, \"I have better places to be than here, but that isn't your fault so I'm not going to be outright mean.\"\n\nAnd the prices, definitely higher than comparable places not in Las Vegas, but still far cheaper than most of what you'll find on the Strip. And the portions are pretty huge. I couldn't finish my nachos, and I had barely eaten anything else that day up until that point.\n\nSo yeah, it's far from perfect, but it's a nice place to eat when you want a good sit down meal, but are sick and tired of being fancy on the Strip."

No joke, the omelets are bigger than my head, and they should probably give you a shovel to eat the side of hash browns with.  However, quality has not been sacrificed for quantity.

AND she was really warm, attentive and friendly throughout our meal. \nThe cup of coffee was HUGE... like a 16 ounce pint glass with a handle on it. which is fine by me, I love coffee! \nI might mention the greeter warned us that their portions were large. The cup of coffee reminded me she wasn't kidding. \nSo instead of ordering waffles with a side of blah blah, I got the bacon and eggs with a side of hash browns and a ... bagel with cream cheese? No kidding? And like, SUPER easy to spread  WHIPPED cream cheese... all part of the ordinary meal... yeah I couldn't finish. Really generous portions and good food! \nMy GF ordered a focaccia chicken sandwich with avocado and prosciutto. I tried the chicken (not having room to even finish my own plate) and it was really tasty.  The actual sandwich was really similar to a Torta. And of course there was a mountain of golden fries on the side... I did sneak a few of these and can say they were great ESPECIALLY with the house ranch sauce. \nGood thing I walked about 5 miles of the strip after we ate!\nI must say though that even after walking a LOT I was full until dinner time."

The boyfriend and I had a burger and a caprese appetizer for lunch and pretty much didn't eat for the rest of the day. I wouldn't come expecting great food but it's a place to stop for drinks and to take in the atmosphere."

They saute was not drained, so there was about 1/8th of of a cup of oil in the bottom on the bowl.  This also made the hash soggy.  If they drained the oil out before the mix with the hash and flat topped to keep the hash crispy , it would be better.  Toast, Coffee and Service was good.  Just don't order the Munch."

You enter the super dark lounge through glass doors and there is a walk down roundabout with a pool (cool water which I tested) and a mini volcano erupting in the center, televisions all around everywhere but then again the ceilings are covered in disco ball mirror tiles and the walls alllll mirrors so maybe there was only one tv but the reflection in the mirrorS made me see otherwise...  anyway it was very calming after a rough night with the bright pink, blue and tiny lil white lights.  I honestly could have taken a nap here and nobody would have seen me.  There are all these small rooms tucked away amidst the mirrors, red carpet and red couches.  $8.00 Bloody marys which are served in a large cocktail glass along with a HUGE piece of celery, tomato and a slice of cucumber are a meal in themselves make it a double for and extra $2.00.  \n\nIts a good time, make sure to stop by next time youre dragging on a morning in Vegas."

Seriously, come hungry or be prepared to take home leftovers. \n\nWhen a place is 24 hours and they serve breakfast the whole time, I tend toward breakfast food. That being said, their eggs benedict is one of the best in Las Vegas. Burgers are delish and cooked to order (beware asking for rare...they take it seriously and will produce something pretty much raw on the inside). The service is great. Waitresses are attentive and friendly. There seem to always be cops eating there; take what you will from that. \n\nDownsides: The place gets crowded. Really crowded. Weeknights seem to be the best time to go if you want to sit down and eat quickly. Also, the parking situation can be difficult. They have an itty bitty parking lot in front (maybe more in the back, not sure!) right on LV Blvd, so getting out can be tricky. \n\nBottom line: if you haven't been, go for the decor.

I did a veggie omlette but I went all Sally from \"Harry met Sally\" on them. I went egg whites, no salt, no mushrooms and substituted to Swiss cheese.  Yeah I was that pain in the butt special order guy. I even asked for crispy hash browns. Mary took my order on the phone and even read it all back to me. She also told me my food would be ready in 10 minutes. \n\nI was finishing my run and headed over to grab my food. I was amazed at how fast I was able to get my food.

I actually couldn't eat it all and saved half of it in my hotel fridge. Hey it's a desert out here, so food hoarding is acceptable here!  Everything was great. The hash browns were really rich.  I think they were cooked in butter. Mmmm...butter!!! I did have to use a few napkins to soak up the oil spill. The omlette was cooked perfectly but again it was huge. Big enough for two people to share. So keep that in mind when you eat here!\n\nIf your looking for an old school Vegas food place, then this is it. There is nothing left like it on the strip.

Featured in everything from CSI to Showgirls and featuring a 24/7 menu of everything from breakfasts and burgers onward to acclaimed nachos and desserts plus a setting quite unlike any other with drunken creatures of the night in all sorts of disarray it was clear on entering the space that it was I who was the novelty and requesting a table for one while using proper manners I was seated quickly, greeted immediately thereafter, and provided with superlative service throughout my 55 minute and 5 cup of coffee (plus one for the road) stay.  Certainly not 'gourmet' or 'artisan' but wholly satisfying for both 'dinner' and 'show' my order would consist of only two items and electing for the carrot cake as an appetizer while my main course was prepared I was happy to find a modest slice of high quality placed before me, the dense body not overly sweetened but instead nutty and aromatic with a thin layer of cream cheese icing adding a tangy sweetness without overwhelming - a balance I neither expected nor received with the decadent pile of custard-laden egg bread that followed complete with fresh fruits, whipped cream, and warm syrup...exactly the sort of thing I imagine I'd crave after a night of drinking...or after an early morning run...or when I was 8 years old...or 25 years later."

Ordered the Country Fried Steak breakfast. Portions were huge. I got a generous helping of hash browns along with egg whites. Two huge pieces of country fried steak with sausage gravy all over. The sausage gravy actually had a generous amount of sausage pieces in it. Drinks here are made strong and do not disappoint. \n\nThe look and feel of the place just screams cheesy. Reminds you of the days of old Vegas with the neon everywhere. It is nice to see that not everything has changed. \n\nIf you are not in the mood for a buffet or a high end restaurant, this is the place to go. Me and my friends came here before a night of debauchery but you could also go here to recover as well."

The environment is still wonderful and intimate in its cheesy neon-y way, but something has happened to the food.  Namely, it's no longer worth the price they're now asking for relatively simple fare.\n\nA basic plate of eggs and pancakes is over $10 now.  Omelettes are around $13.  Uh... what?  $3 for coffee... very, very oily coffee.\n\nMy chorizo and eggs featured overcooked scrambled eggs with very dried-out chorizo mixed in.  The beans that came with them were right out of a can and heated for way too long, until they were cracked and dry.\n\nMy wife's corn beef hash and eggs was runny, with canned hash underneath.  It was greasy and not very good.\n\nNormally, I'd not be so disappointed by greasy or not well cooked breakfast food -- they're not called greasy spoons for nothing -- but for the price, the ire rises dramatically.\n\nIt saddens me to say it, but if you're after great breakfast fare in Vegas, go for Blueberry Hill, or Hash House a go-go instead.  You'll be much happier.  Maybe we just got a bad line cook that day, but the impression is going to stick with us for quite a long time."

It's awesome, and if you're looking for a weird place for a drink that isn't in a casino, it's really a must-visit. Fire pits and scorpion bowls. Awesome. But keep in mind, adults only.)\n\nThe Peppermill is a restaurant of all booths, and other than high-chairs and the chairs along the counter, there isn't a single free-standing chair in the whole place. Vegas is all about making everyone feel special, and as everyone loves a booth, everyone gets one. And like I mentioned, they do provide the standard restaurant high-chairs that pull up to the end of the booth. All the tables are normal table height, so there's no problem accommodating very young eaters.\n\nThe menu is similar to the best of NYC diners. Namely, there's almost anything on it, from eggs to fried chicken to steak to pancakes. As for the kids menu, it's small and very basic. There are chicken fingers, mac and cheese with fruit, grilled cheese, bacon and eggs, french toast and the very awesome pancake face. The prices are very reasonable (all the kids menu items are either $5.95 or $6.95) and if your child is older or more adventurous they can of course order from the complete adult menu. And don't forget, you're in Vegas so The Peppermill is open 24 hours, 7 days a week including all holidays. \n\nAs for the service, here in Las Vegas we have pretty high standards, and in the seven years I've been going there I've never had anything but an outstanding waitress who has been super friendly to my kids.\n\nThe Peppermill is the perfect combination of good food and outstanding Vegas kitsch."

My husband and I have always made a special trip to the Peppermill every time we're in Vegas, so naturally, we picked it as the location for our rehearsal dinner. I called to make reservations about 3 weeks in advance. I even wrote to them on their site to ask about the availability of a vegan meal for one of my guests. I never got an email or call back, by the way. \n\nWhen I called to make the reservation for 6 people, I confirmed with the manager about a vegan meal. I called back a week later to add 2 more people to my reservation, and change my time to 6PM. So it was confirmed, TWICE. When we got to the Peppermill, they had no reservations for us. The hostess said we would have to wait with everyone else and made no apologies for the mistake. She even said they do not accept reservations, even though it says they do on their site and I called and did so! I asked to speak with a manager. The manager had no explanation and was actually rude about it. Our party had to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, which defeated the purpose of me making reservations in the first place. Then, once we ordered, my meal and my husband's meal was served 20 minutes after everyone else in my party's meal. \n\nThis was the worst experience I have ever had at the Peppermill. My reception dinner was ruined. I was so embarrassed by the poor service and the rudeness of the hostess and manager, especially after we told everyone what a great place this was. I can't see myself dining there again. I was so disappointed. I had other out-of-town wedding guests who asked about dining there. I warned them that the service isn't what it used to be. \n\nPeppermill, if you're reading this, please make your staff aware that in this economy, this is the best way to lose loyal customers, rudeness and poor service."

We stopped in for some cold beers and an afternoon snack. We ordered the nachos, topped with beef. What we received was something the size of a small planet: a mountain of multi-colored chips topped with delicious beef chili, cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes, olives sour cream, guacamole. It was fabulous. And our snack was big enough that we didn't need dinner, and had plenty left to snack on all evening.\n\nSo we came back the next day, (why wouldn't we?), for a real dinner. We split a quesadilla and a steak and mushroom salad. Again, generously portioned and delicious. Steak was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned. Mushrooms, and blue cheese topped the salad and they were delicious. The quesadilla had a fresh pico on the inside and it was phenomenal.\n\nYou must try this place.

You can get breakfast, lunch, or a dinner at just about any time of day.  However, be prepared to wait, whatever time of day it is, you will more than likely have to wait for a table.  And the service is ok.  But the food and prices are worth it."

They wear long cocktail dresses and have big hair and show lot of..um...well, you get the picture. Everytime we ordered drinks, our waitress would sit down on the ottoman. Probably because she was in heals all day, but none of the men or women in my group complained."

They did a great job of fitting as much seating as they could and yet its still comfortable because they are booths and not tables on top of each other.\nThey had a TON of fake flowers all over the place. Even fake trees in the center. I really am not a fan of all that fake flower crap, the colors are usually off of real stuff. The fake stuff gets SO darned dusty, too, and that's just plain gross especially in a restaurant environment. The one fake ivy thing by me didn't feel dusty, but we were still thankful we weren't stuck under one of the trees.\nThey have a cocktail waitress, which kind of reminds you of old style Vegas. The cocktail we were handed didn't list Amy beer at all, so I had to wait for her to come to our table to find out what they had. 1 draft option, Stella, so I ordered it. Alas, they were out. So I ordered a bottles beer. Wouldn't it be the cocktail waitresses job to know that there's no Stella tonight?\n\nAnyway...\nThe menu was what you'd expect in a diner, lots of choices and many fried.. And it was about the quality that you'd expect - we had cream cheese stuffed chicken with penne pasta and country fried steak with mashed potatoes. My hubby said the mashed potatoes were average and enjoyed the country fried steak. My cream cheese/herb stuffed chicken was fried and not too bad. LOADS of pasta, way more than one portion.\n\nWe also had dessert - a brownie Sunday for the hubs and strawberry shortcake for me. I asked for some fudge to be added to it and they accommodated (it's super yummy that way)."

None of us were able to agree on what kind of food we wanted so decided to go to the Peppermill as we always heard they had a huge eclectic menu.  We arrived a 1:20 on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed.  We had called in and put our name on the waiting list (no reservation taken for afternoons I was told) but still had about a 20 minute wait. The potpourri of clientele ranges from families, with grandmotherly types  to young fashionably cool model types and everything in between.\n\nThe decor is retro coffee shop on a bit of LSD... lots of neon and cool black light effects... quite an interesting breakfast spot!\n\nI can't believe it took so long for us go there. So easy to get into.. no 6 level park garages and trudging through the casinos to get to a Strip eaterie.  Parking is easy and the menu is huge, with a lot of old American style standards, and also a few healthier alternatives if you scour the menu well.  The prices are very good and all three of us loved what we ordered. Our server (Destiny) was cute as can be, and very sweet as well as very efficient.\n\nWe had a nice bottle of wine and shared food and drink with each other and it was a treat. Christine had the Gourmet Shrimp Salad... with balsamic dressing...a really huge delicious salad, with fruit and avocado and some good sized shrimp. I had the pastrami burger with curly fries and our friend Maya had the Eggs Benedict.  We ordered a fudge brownie with ice cream for desert that that was huge and we didn't come close to finishing. Our total bill $104.\n\nOn the way out we checked out the Fireside Lounge which is a pretty sexy flashback to the late 70's early 80's with its hot pink furnishings and low profile seating around the fire pit... probably quite the pickup spot in the early morning hours... if the fire pit wasn't there a stripper pole would be a natural. :-)"

It's completely dark, and neon, and looks very much like a diner right out of the 1950s. Gaudy decorations, but hey, it's Vegas. \n\nWhile you wait, enjoy the actual fireside lounge in the bar area. The bartenders and cocktail waitresses are friendly. \n\nAs for the food, it's delicious. Usually you don't complain with 24 hour breakfast. Everything is delicious, you won't go wrong here. \n\nIf you willing to wait a bit for good old fashioned American food, this is the place to go on the Strip."

No skimping on the alcohol.\n\nI did find it a little weird that all the servers are wearing long, black, busty gowns, but they looked classier than at other places, for sure.\n\nThey played old, live music clips of 90's artists singing their biggest hits, like Jewel, Hootie, and Sheryl Crow. Again, a little odd, but pleasant."

I would highly recommend the Key Lime Pie Martini.  Delicious and tasted just like the desert with a graham cracker crust  rim.  A photographer came by and offered to take \"free\" pictures of our group with no obligation.

It's probably the least healthy thing you will order on the menu, but you can feel better about yourself when you see the broccoli and cauliflower on the plate. \n\nIf you need a third dish, I suggest the sampler platter or anything with hash browns.

It took about a half hour for two of us to be seated. They recommended that we wait in the fireside room. We didn't take them up on that but it must be huge because people kept piling in there. You feel like you are in a bit of a time warp here. Waitresses in panty hose and plastic plants abound. \n\nOnce we were seated, the service was great. We decided to split the Lorraine omelette and a Belgian waffle. The omelette was light and fluffy. It featured the perfect amount of bacon. The waffle was solid. I ordered a mimosa for the Mr. It was quite large and carried the price tag to match its size.\n\nMy biggest complaint was trying to pay the bill to leave. They have one old fashioned register for the entire restaurant. I had to stand in a line, along the diner stool area and had to constantly move to get out of people's way. It took over 15 minutes to pay our bill."

My corned beef hash tasted like it came out of a can and not from a fresh corned beef - which is preferable by my standards!  \n\nA guy comes around and very nicely takes a group photo of your table and prints it on to a free postcard of the Peppermill and then tries to sell you a larger photo for your coffee table.  What the heck - we bought two.  \n\nNo casino here.  But just as much old Vegas flash."

Of course, the food was good too!\n\nI had the CLUB SANDWICHES for the first time. There was a lot of bacon and ham. The bread was toasted. It was great. And, it came with a lot of fries! \n\nThe second time, my husband and I shared 22OZ STRAWBERRY MILK SHAKE. It was HUGE and GREAT!!! My husband and I loved it! \n\nAlso, I ordered CHICKEN FRIED STEAK. That was my first chicken fried steak. It was covered with gravy. It was crunchy and flavorful. The steak was so big that I didn't even touch the eggs. Haha... \n\nI like this place. It is a nice little dinner. The decor was very cute. It is a bit off the strip, but it's close enough. I think that it is a great breakfast place with a good price in Vegas. Give it a try!"

Mirrored ceiling tiles, fake plants everywhere you look, old school upholstery, neon lights, this place has it all.  \nWe were seated at the counter and as we order our cocktails we were told there would be a cocktail server around to help us.  What?  But sure enough a lady in a floor length black dress came by and quickly took our drink order before disappearing into the kitchen.  Then our food server came by  and did the rest of the work, very unique set up.  The restaurant was VERY busy on a Saturday morning and the staff was buzzing about trying to get everyone fed, paid and out the door.  We ordered the ham and eggs and the steak and eggs, everything was huge and pretty well done.  Unfortunately I had to leave about half of my breakfast since it was so large but now we know to share for next time."

Tucked away in the 'no man's land' north of Wynn/Encore and south of Riviera, this place is easy to miss unless you're up for a bit of a hike from mid-Strip or have a car at your disposal. My party started with the appetizer sampler platter which could've nearly stuffed the three of us in and of itself. Hand-dipped onion rings, bruschetta and fried mozzarella sticks that were obviously also hand-cut and hand-dipped. All with the requisite dipping accoutrements. So happy. Two of us had the giant pesto burger as an entree and as delicious as the medium-well (ordered medium so I'll order med-rare next time) beef patty on brioche was, I could only eat about half. Good thing I had a fridge in my hotel room as this made for a wonderful snack (even when cold) the next evening.\n\nThe atmosphere is as many others say. Like a fully-blown Vegased out version of an all-American diner. Think Denny's with a neon problem. Just lovely and fits the Strip to a tee. Service was great the night we were there and beverage refills were quick and without having to ask.\n\nWe stepped into the separate lounge next door to have a look before leaving and were simply awestruck. Why did we bother with the restaurant when we could have certainly ordered from a bar menu here and enjoyed giant frou-frou drinks while we waited. So that just whet my appetite for my next sojourn to Vegas.\n\nIt's a timeless classic in a town that insists on constantly reinventing itself. Just go. It probably won't change or close anytime soon, but don't take any chances!"

I recommend the scorpian. Its huge with like 8 different shots but tastes like fruit punch! Or the grasshopper, its like a blended thin mint mmmm....\n\nGreat appetizers too!

Anyway, as the hostess seated us I made sure to check our booth seats to make sure there weren't any stains on it (if you know what I mean). \n\nWe decided to order and I went with a plain 2 eggs, hash brown and sausage meal with a strawberry mojito. My girl ordered french toast and eggs with a mimosa. There wasn't  really anything too special about the food. It was as basic as they come, but the drinks were pretty good! (Boogie Nights is the movie btw)\n\nI did have the opportunity to check out the nice section (separate room) of the restaurant with the fire pit and TV's surrounding it and that part of the restaurant is really cool.

If Marin's Peppermill had that issue,  they probably would have stayed in business!   We were able to get a seat at the counter immediately,  and were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.

Oh my gosh, thick foccacia style bread, buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomatos, drizzled with balsamic and basil served with a side of fresh fruit.  Yum...I just started drooling thinking about it.

No sirree this was the entire piece of meat teetering on a bed of greens.  Granted it wasn't Meyer's Ranch's finest but still for $13.95, holy cow!\n\nLet me not forgot about the most divine part of Peppermill: their breakfast which is served 24 hours.  Of course I've had it at normal hours as well as after leaving the club at 4 AM but the pinnacle of it all is weekend brunch after some hard partying.  Prepare for a 45 minute to an hour wait for a table but so worth it.  Their french toast is melt-in-your-mouth, the eggs benedict is the best classic version I've had in Vegas and their omelettes are too die for and big enough for 2-3 people to share.  Don't forget about their Bloody Marys which are the size of a vase (Rock star tip:  Order an extra shot to ease the transition back to the daylight).\n\nI was torn between 4 and 5 stars because with so many 5 star dining places in Vegas, Peppermill is not the most innovative but I just have to give Peppermill the benefit of the doubt and go with 5 because honestly it is just so d*** good."

I halfway expected to see strippers inside, sort of like the breakfast/brunch bars in Portland. (the building is lit with blue neon) Instead, we got a really cool restaurant where the servers were friendly, and moderately dressed, by Vegas standards at least. We were seated promptly, and within five minutes, our food orders were taken, our bar orders were fulfilled by a different waitress/bar girl, and our sodas and waters were refilled. I swear, I think we were helped by at least six different people, and usually at this time of night, most places are running on skeleton crews. I ordered the ribs, which were amazing, and my friends got the alfredo, corned beef meal and steak, all of which looked flippin delicious.

Perfect spot to grab a quick bite after a night out on the Strip. \n\nCame in at around midnight and we're so pleased to see that there actually wasn't a wait! The place is huge and is completely decorated with the theme!\n\nThe offer almost everything you could be craving at the middle of the night. The best part is, the portions ARE HUGE especially for the price. I ordered the Yogurt Parfait and WOW it could have probably served 5 people. It reminded me a lot of McDonald's parfait but with much much better quality fruits and granola. Other notable dishes: Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap (the curly fries with it is AMAZING), Joe's San Francisco Special, and Tostada Omelet. \n\nThe service was not bad! For the most part, everything was what you would expect from a diner so I'm perfectly pleased. Definitely will be back to check out their Fireside Lounge though!!"

Great decor, indoor trees, friendly staff,  and affordable meals makes this place stand out.  Being just north of the now main drag of Las Vegas Boulevard, its definitley within striking distance and easy to get to.  Most dishes here are under $15 and the portion size are good.  The fact that its open 24 hours immediately made this place one of my favorite places on the strip.  I got the sampler which is quite similar to the Denny's sampler but tasty!  Chicken strips, mozzarella sticks, onion rings....yup, its a diet nightmare.  The onion rings were quite notable.  The crowd is also a mixed bag of locals, tourists and vegas characters.  Highly recommend this place when you are tired of blowing your cash on the strip!"

I was expecting to enter a world straight outta \"Boogie Nights\" or something, but what I got was a decor that looked decidely more \"Scarface\" than \"Casino\". The tacky blue neon lighting and faux foliage made me feel like I was stuck in the 80's. I kept expecting our waitress to bring out a complimentary mountain of \"booga suga\" just to get the feast off to a rockin' start. \n\nThe food here was adequate in quality and price. I got the chicken foccacia sandwich with fruit salad. The sandwich was a heavy meal, due in no small part to the bread, so I opted to ditch the carbs and mow down on the avocado and breast a la carte. The fruit \"salad\" was just a bowl of honeydew and cantaloupe and one single grape. Maybe I'm wrong, but a salad, to me, consists of a multitude of various fruits and such. That's like saying a lettuce and croutons is a salad. Not to me it ain't.\n\nI think my party and I should have headed into the lounge after our meal, since that seems to be all the rage. I'm not sure why we didn't. Perhaps we were clouded in our thinking after such a filling meal. Alcohol is pointless on such a full stomach; it does nothing but further my bloat. Still, this was a blast from the past and well worth our time to check out."

For two, it just exudes Vegas.\n\nI will not be returning.\n\nAfter getting our drinks and ordering my daughter's food, I witnessed a cockroach crawl across the table.\n\nThe waitress came over as I was standing up to leave, in shock, and I explained that a cockroach came over... my friend brushed it off the table... and I stomped on it.  I pointed to its carcass on the floor.  I was still putting my coat on when a manager came by and asked me to please stay.\n\nShe said they were sprayed the previous day and that they were assured they had no bugs.  She invited me to look at the kitchen to see how clean it is.  Then she moved us to a different table.  \n\nI was really freaking out, but no one else in my party seemed to be bothered by the bug.  My daughter has mild OCD and I didn't want to exacerbate it, so I tried my best to not draw too much attention to the situation.  She was starving and it was almost bedtime so I allowed her to eat her pancake and we just stayed.  I know for certain if she was not there that I would have RUN out.\n\nI tried my best to eat a couple bites of my food, but I was paranoid the entire time and could not eat.\n\nOur bill was comped, as it should have been.

They offer a veggie burger and a salad or two and of course breakfast food.\n\nThis trip I was determined to check out the Fireside Lounge.  And I'm glad we did.  We took a seat on the cooshy couches surrounding the fire and ordered some appetizers.  It was a Sunday night and kind of quiet which was fine by us.  The neon, the decor, the fire.  So wonderfully cheesy.  I loved it.  \n\nThey have a few small flat screen TVs affixed above the fire pit and they play music videos and live concerts which can provide some laughs, depending on your taste in music.\n\nI am glad I finally checked out the lounge as I read rumors that the Peppermill may be closing with no plan to relocate.

The waitresses are super-friendly and they'll remember you between visits.\n\nMy only complaints are that the drinks are a little weak and the music selection a little poppy. The former is because I've been conditioned by super-strong Fink Bombs at Frankie's Tiki Room, and the latter is because I'm apparently a hipster douche.

The front restaurant is pretty much a \"Denny's\" but the back has late night bar food, sunken booths with a fire pit and old school decor with neon lights and probably the original lights from 1980.  So fun!\n\nThe food is exactly what you would expect, bar food.  Good quality but bar food nonetheless."

I had the pancakes and bacon and sausage and eggs! Totally yummy. The coffee and hot chocolate comes in huge mugs, which is sort of different from your regular diner. \n\nService is decent and prices aren't too bad, portions are huge, so be careful what you order because it's a ton of food. The decor is cute, 50's style with lit up booths and plants and lights everywhere. Definitely Vegas-like.  Worth trying for sure."

Peppermill is away from the hussle and bussle of the mega resorts but sits conveniently next to the Riviera Hotel with its own easy access parking lot right off the strip.  I came here with a friend's suggestion for breakfast and it was a refreshing change from the overpriced, small portioned offerings in the touristy casinos.  \n\nPeppermill has HUGE portions, I ordered the pancake combo for $12.99 which consisted of 3 pancakes as large as a dinner plate, 3 eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausage.  Not only is this a great value price wise, but the portions are probably double of what you would get elsewhere.  My friend got the chicken and spinach omlete made from 10 eggs!  It was a monster of a dish and delicious at that.  The customers seemed to be a mix of vegas locals and tourists but the vibe was comfortable and inviting.  Service was excellent and attentive.  Would definitely come here again next time I'm in vegas.  Oh, forgot to mention they are 24 hours and offer a full bar, nice!"

Showed up at around 5 am and a friend and I split some kind of nachos that were pretty good. Of course we weren't expecting mexican food and what we got was not very mexican, but at least it was what we expected. Another friend got a denver omelette and said it was the bomb. The waitress was very nice (read she didn't press sexual harassment charges against any of my friends) and had a good sense of humor. It's nice that they're open when you need them.

Aren't we excited!  \n\nI love this place, in actuality, especially as a last stop on a night that's gone on a little too long when the weather's a little too chilly.  At about 2 AM on such a night, warming oneself at the fire pit with a gigantic plate full of nachos is pretty much an unparalleled delight.\n\nThe blue and pink neon is a little too bright, but it gives the Lounge a character no other place has.  I could do without the flat screens playing Phish and the like, but you can't win 'em all.  The drinks are a little pricey, ($7 for a well drink, $9 and up for specialties) but you ARE on the Strip and you're paying for that awesome fire pit too.  (That gas bill must be outrageous.)  The waitresses are always very polite and prompt, and their dresses make me giggle just a little bit.  (Long, black cocktail dresses look somehow out of place and perfectly comfortable there at the same time.)  The Peppermill is really the only place worth lounging at for a local on the Strip anymore, so let's keep it on the downlow and keep the tourists away, shall we?  Shhhhh!"

We headed over to this restaurant that was close to our hotel, and after a short wait we were seated in this kitschy wonderland. There were so many things on the menu that sounded delicious that it took me awhile to decide what to order. I ended up choosing the french toast ambrosia, and it....was....AMAZING. When I read \"topped with seasonal fruit\", I thought there would be a few strawberries or something on top of my french toast. No, it was a platter full of french toast absolutely slathered in whipped cream, blueberries, blackberries, bananas, grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, and honeydew. It doesn't get any better than that, folks.\n\nOur server was very nice and tolerated my friend (who always insists on modifying her menu items). We left a really generous tip. \n\nConsidering most of the food in Vegas is expensive and crappy, this place is a MUST. I would definitely go here again the next time I am in Vegas."

It was only a few blocks walk through the back streets of Vegas. (By that I mean off the strip, for all us tourist folk)  I have been wanting to go there for a while now, and it did not disappoint.\nThe decor was dark with neon light accents everywhere. Mostly of the blue and pink variety. The bartenders were up there in age, so they knew how to entertain and keep conversation going. I forget the bartenders name that was serving my girlfriend and I, but he was a good time. \nMy girl and I ended up finding an open spot at the indoor fire pit so we lounged there for a while. It was interesting... Great for people watching and you get one eclectic crowd walking in and out of there. All sort of race, creed, gender and class. It is now a must go to every time I head to Vegas.\nIf you are the clubbing/ bar hopping type, its the perfect place to sit with the guys and plan your strategy over some good food and a few drinks. On the other hand, its a great place to just sit after a long night/ morning and well, lounge."

I had to get my drink and go out into the waiting area while we were waiting for friends to meet us for dinner. It was super bad.\n\nJust a general observation for Vegas newbies:\nI see some reviews saying their $29 steak was really just a $9 steak. FYI - This is what I like to call the Vegas tax, and while this is just a diner, you're still in Vegas. Everything is more expensive here, even diner food. If you want a good steak, you'll usually have to pay $45+ in Vegas. If you go to a diner for a steak, it will be a diner steak. You're looking at the price with the mentality of where ever it is you're coming from and setting the bar too high. A $29 ribeye on the strip IS a steal."

Heard about Peppermill from a few different sources and it definitely lives up to the hype. It's super old school Vegas feel and you get the best bang for your buck. This scramble was very good and it came with a Bran Muffin. Huge portion and it was only $13.75. The place was packed and I could see why. Great food, large portions, attentive service, cool decor, and great value. This is a must when in Vegas."

It's like I walked into the twilight zone. Very purple.  I think the servers outfits are awesome. I really like the long velvet gowns the cocktail servers wear. The price seemed high for this place.  Fettuccine Alfredo $20.  We decided to share and got the nachos as starters.  The food arrived and we were shocked, the portions were huge!  We invited two more friends. The nachos were basic, made with real cheese, olives, jalape\u00f1os. It also came with a side of beans and the canned type cheese mixed together.  I probably would not order it again.  The fettuccine was surprisingly good.  Added a little pepper then it was better.   It also came with a Caesar salad which was fine and two pieces  of garlic bread.  The 4 of us didn't even finish all the food!  At the end we waited forever not realizing we pay at the front. The server never mentioned it.  I took a peek at the bar and it looked really cozy with a fire pit.  Seems like a cool place to have a drink."

After gathering my belongings I looked up restaurants nearby and yelp recommended The Peppermill. Me and my significant other decided to give it a try. \n\nUpon entering we were happily greeted by a 70's diner like atmosphere. We were promptly seated and had a super happy bubbly waitress who offered us some of the best service I've ever had at a restaurant. She was on top of her game the entire time! \n\nI ordered the cheese sticks and nachos for an appetizer. The cheese sticks were pretty good but the nachos were out of this world! They were HUGE! (And extremly tasty.) I ordered the peppermill breakfast combo (pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage) and it was excellent. WAY better than a Denny's or chain. The pancakes were thick and hearty. My significant other ordered the salmon and loved it! We ended the night with the brownie and ice cream which was absolutely to die for! \n\nWe enjoyed the restaurant so much we came back for a second round! We ordered Wings, breakfast food and a sandwich (I can't remember the name) with roast beef, thousand island and a few other things which sort of resembled a reuben. We were completely satisfied with both meals and are going to miss this place when we leave! \n\nIf you are looking for amazing food, a great atmosphere, A+ service and a bill that won't leave your pockets empty, I HIGHLY recommend The Peppermill!"

At any rate, I was primed and ready for a hearty, big-portioned meal. The Peppermill apparently has notoriety for that. I'm pleased to say that it didn't disappoint.\n\nWe were enticed by the Chicken Nachos as an appetizer. Little did we know that the Chicken Nachos would actually end up as our appetizer AND dinner. The serving size was enormous. Huge! Slathered in a variety of melted cheeses and topped with all the usual suspects, it was amazing. What I loved about it was that all the accouterments were served on the side: a bowl of re-fried beans and more melted cheese, sour cream, salsa and hot sauce. It's nice to be able to have control over the toppings.  Heaven! Bliss! After we were done with the nachos we knew we couldn't even consider ordering a dinner entree. \n\nI'm a little disappointed because I really was excited about trying Peppermill's Red Pepper Chicken Pasta. It'll have to wait until another trip, sadly. \n\nWe also ordered margaritas. Honestly, they seemed watered down. But we are from San Diego and have very high standards for our margaritas. As such, I'll give them a pass for that. \n\nThe Peppermill appears to have an eclectic demographic, consisting primarily of locals (at least at dinner hour). Our cab driver confirmed that. The douchebags don't typically venture that far down the strip, from what I've learned. \n\nI would highly recommend this place. If you're a foodie like me, you will leave in a happy food coma. Make reservations in advance to avoid a wait. I'm glad I did."

However once inside you'll see its true appeal. It literally looked like a strip club but was missing the most essential aspect of it, a pole! That could've, would've been nice! \n\nThe front end was nice and did a great job dealing with all the hangry (hungry and angry) people. However, the service was a bit off once we were seated. It took a while for our waitress to make her way to us which is understandable given that they were swamped but we had been waiting for 50+ minutes and could've used a refreshment right off the bat.\n\nOur orders came out all together which was nice; none of that awkward waiting and watching for others to get their plates. I got the Eggs Benedict which was pretty good and priced at at about $13. I liked how the hollandaise sauce tasted. It was a bit tangier than others I've had in the past.  The eggs were poached nicely and ran lovely through my crispy hashbrowns. My friends tried numerous things such as the club sandwich, the BLAT sandwich, and an omelette all of which was pleasing.  \n\nOverall, definitely not a bad option if you're in Vegas and want something yummy and fun for breakfast. However, if there's a long wait I wouldn't bother. I personally, didn't think it was worth the 50+ minutes we waited to just get seated. I did think the lounge was a fun place and wouldn't mind stopping by there for a pregame drink."

Looks like third time's a charm, because I was finally able to step inside the glory that is Peppermill, and loved it so much that I came back the next morning for brunch part two.\n\nPeppermill is like an 80s Club + Rainforest Cafe, so basically my two favorite things combined (not even really joking about that). Please take a moment to imagine neon pink and purple lights running along the ceiling, lush fake foliage abound, vibrant blue stained glass lamps overhanging each table, while you enjoy your morning booze and breakfast. No, seriously. IMAGINE.\n\nBoth mornings, we dropped in and put our names down before heading into the mysterious \"Fireside Lounge\" door. The 80s club vibe kicks up about 200 notches here, as you descend into a circular pit complete with rusted orange sofas, and outdated music videos on a tv that hovers above a circular pool and fire pit. It feels good for about 18 second before it's absolutely too hot to be down there, but you don't leave because it's just. too. cool. Start off by enjoying a cocktail in any variety (A sweet strawberry take on the mimosa? A ridiculous huge daquiri in a glass the size of a baby's head? Even coffee with baileys will do ya!), served by a young lady in a satin prom dress, before being whisked away to your dining experience.\n\nBreakfast on both mornings was deelish. Morning A introduced me to the eggs benedict, while Morning B seemed fine for the chorizo. Both were extra tasty. On Morning B I asked if an iced coffee was a possibility, though it wasn't on the menu - the server happily accommodated by pouring coffee over ice into an ice cream sundae glass. I also love that coffee comes with options like vanilla creamer and RAINBOW SUGAR! \n\nPretty much I wanna be here like 'erry day."

Food is 1000 Xs better too.   \n\nI had Philly Cheesesteak and it was the best.    Also had a Buffalo Chk wrap which was also amazing.    Great fries and great service.\n\nSit at the counter for some fun watching the whole operation!"

First of all, I think it's probably CRAZY on weekends because we were there on a Wednesday morning and there was a crowd of people... luckily only a 15 minute wait, though.  Perfect timing for us to head into the Fireside Lounge for a Bloody Mary!\n\nThe Fireside is AWESOME.  It's so 70s Vegas... all shiny and neon.  There is a big fire and water element in the middle with couches around it in a circle.  Love it.  The Bloody Mary was huge, but not so strong.  I just totally loved the atmosphere and it was nice for us because it was also pretty empty, so we had the fire pit to ourselves.\n\nWhen they called our names, we were sat in a big booth and ordered our breakfast.  The husband had a French Dip and ordered the fruit as his side and WOW, it was a huge bowl of nice fruit, including a whole cut up banana, strawberries and melons.    Very nice. I was jealous.  I wanted to try a bunch of things so ended up getting scrambled eggs, hash browns and biscuits and gravy.  It was WAY too much food, so I only ate about a third of it.  The \"three eggs side\" was more like about 5 eggs.  The biscuits and gravy were good, but not great and a huge plate.  I think they should do a smaller version.  I wasn't that fond of the hash browns either.  Only the very top was crunchy and the pieces are just too big for hash browns.  But, otherwise, I enjoyed the food.  \n\nOur server was attentive and the food came out quick.  Cost for food was about $30, but I over ordered.  We really enjoyed our meal and the whole experience.  I definitely recommend a visit to the Peppermill!"

Not to mention the Rose Bowl was going and we needed a place with big screen to the watch the game. \n\nSo, Peppermill it is and thank you god for that place. \n\nThe hostess told us that the Lounge only have starters, so we planned on drinking and watching for a bit with a sampler, then head back to the restaurant for food during half time. \n\nWe walked into a rose vine covered Lounge with the bar on the right and watery fire pits on the left, flat screen and semi circle couches are all over the place. The lounge server was Anna, a dark hair Romanian beauty that looks like a cross of Rachel McAdams and Lauren Graham but hotter, younger, with longer legs. Yes, I know I shouldn't be reviewing this place based on her, but it is that golden sunset at your Malibu mansion that sets your place apart to other locations. \n\nThe food and drinks were a flowing, everything worked out with pretty good service. Then we left at half time for food, which just was a bit overpriced but it is very good. Service was prompt and Silviya's suggestion on the omelet are a great one. Milk shake and carrot cake were pretty right on the spot. \n\nOverall, if you are in Vegas, go see Anna in the Lounge for business meeting or to chill with friends. Food, you can save more money going to somewhere else, but probably not as good."

Mainly a little less then average place, just to have something to eat and not much to really look at, except the other booth of people around you. But Peppermill, proved me wrong about 24 hour restaurants, and looks more then an average place. Now this was an ideal 24 hour restaurants, that I wish it could take over Denny's. Then I would be coming there all the time. \n\nLocated next to Riveria, its a very colorful restaurant on the strip. Of course I had my doubts about going here, but glad my wife twisted my arm and go. Outside, it may look a bit unsure on cause its close to downtown. But despite the fancy looks that you can see on the outside, inside, is a whole different story. The seating is not like no other picnic table booth, its basically a curved booth with nice, colorful seating. You don't have to worry about being smooshed against the wall anymore. Each booth is like curved like the letter \"C\", all over the restaurant. It has very nice lighting, and very wonderful arrangements, like your in the rainforest. Not like Rainforest Cafe, but a bit less elaborate then Rainforest Cafe. \n\nThe staff was wonderful, we were seated right away, we were served drinks, once we were seated. Our waitress was very nice as well. They all wore colorful uniforms and made the place interesting. She always made sure that we were okay. \n\nLooking over the menu, the pricing was a bit more then I expected. But once I got my food, I can see why. The food was in big portions. I ordered the New York Steak, and ordered it well done. I was amazed that it came out well done. I mean, no pink what so ever on that meat. Usually when I order steak, it doesn't seem well done, but this time around, it was. Made me think about next time I come here, I should order medium. I don't mind pink, but I thought like any other place I had a well done steak, it had little pink. But I really did enjoy my New York steak. It did come with a salad, and it came big. Also came with Onion rings that were big. Mainly everything was big, even my wife's coffee cup was big. As much as I wanted to try to finish it, I couldn't. I came so close though. Finish the salad, the steak, but threw in the towel with 3 onion rings left. \n\nIf your looking for a place to eat in the middle of the night. Peppermill will surely not disappoint. The pricing may be more then usual, but its well worth the price, especially when everything comes at you in big portions. Very well recommended 24 hour restaurant."

Or for the finale, pancakes that hang off all edges of your plate? \n\nPeppermill is definitely for the Adam Richman (Man Vs. Food host) in all of us. One would think with quantity, quality suffers but Peppermill definitely proves that adage wrong. Me and my sis always order pancakes, bacon, and the fruit&granola bowl: all are fantastic. The fruit&granola bowl is about the size of 2 banana splits. Pancakes are HUGE, over 12\" in diameter (at least) with a fluffy sweetness to them that beg for just a tiny amount of syrup when you dress them with the AWESOME \"stripper\" sugar sprinkles.\n\nI definitely love this place. The blue neon and comfortable seating and long raised walkways turned into foliage.........somehow makes me believe Peppermill used to be a strip club in a former life.......but who knows ;-). \n\nService is great here: quick, friendly, and very personable. It's reassuring to know that in a city built on transient party goers, at a place centered on the strip, people still remember your name.\n\nGive this place a try."

Pork was tender and shredded, but was a basic sandwich.\n\nBasically, I should have tried something that was more on the \"diner\" side (burgers, sandwiches) instead of something like a pulled pork sandwich that takes a lot of time to cook. Basically I learned not only from here, but from any place that serves \"BBQ\", if there's no pit and you don't smell it in the air, don't order \"BBQ\".  \n\nIn conclusion, Peppermill is more for nostalgia of earlier Vegas with Denny's type food.

This time (Tuesday morning) we sat at the counter after being seated at a booth. We didn't have a problem with where we were seated but wanted to enjoy a slightly different experience. What made this restaurant stand out, beyond just having quality food, is the fact that the manager made it a concern of hers to make sure there was nothing wrong with where we were seated.

The menu is pretty typical of a lot of the 24 hour diner options -- an expansive menu of appetizers, sandwiches, entrees, and breakfasts.  My French Dip was excellent especially with swiss cheese and mushrooms, both of which were extra.  The service was very typical of the Strip -- very attentive and a team of staff as opposed to one specific waiter.\n\nBy far, one of my favorite dining options and a rare remnant of the old school Vegas."

I can't remember anything else much like it.  For a 24hr diner, this is a decent choice.  The prices aren't that cheap for being outside of a casino, but it's still on the strip.\n\nThe servers were VERY friendly as well.\n\nI would only recommend this place for late night because there are better choices during more normal hours."

We sat at the counter each time and had the pleasure to talk with the daytime manager as well as several servers (Crystal, Elisha, and Al, to name a few).  Everyone was kind, hardworking, and friendly.  We had breakfast one day, a midday snack of a quesadilla and milkshake, and the appetizer sampler the last day.  I can't fit in my pants now that I'm back at work, but it was worth it."

On Sunday 21 July 2013, we were coming out of the Riviera casino (show \"Illusions\") and used the Yelp app on my phone to find a place to eat. Because of the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try the Peppermill Restaurant located next to the casino.\n\nThe reviews were right. The place is very unique with lots of neon lights and spacious tables. The food was great and the portions too big to finish. Service was great and prices very reasonable. It was later at night but the place was still very busy but we did not have to wait. If you are looking for a fun dining experience in a diner type restaurant, I highly recommend this place."

We had a large group, about 10, and it took a really long time to seat us, even though we seemed to be the only people waiting in the front. They finally sat us down with attitude after about 20 minutes when we complained. Then we were served by the most sassy waitress I've ever had, whose idea of asking for orders was, \"What you want?!\" After waiting for our food for a good bit we were all served our breakfast...cold. The Munch's Breakfast I ordered was literally thrown down on the table in front of me and was abysmal. The eggs tasted powdered or like they were sitting under a heat lamp for a while. The sausage had gross texture and flavor. Everything about the dish was sub-par, which was particularly annoying when one takes into account how EXPENSIVE the whole meal was. I know things in Vegas aren't cheap, but a simple egg scramble with some veggies and meat for like $14? Come on! For all 10 of us the meal came out to around $225. No one, and I mean no one, at our table enjoyed the dining experience at The Peppermill. The service was rude, the food was terrible and overpriced. My advice to someone looking for some good breakfast: go anywhere else. Hell, drive out to Primm and eat at a gas station- it'll be half the price and just as good."

Really???  You walk in to a restaurant and you see neon rainbow lights, slot machines, dogwood trees and waitresses dressed up in skittles colored uniforms.  The visual entertainment alone is enticing enough for me to go there time and time again.  Even the sugar on the table is rainbow colored.\n\nThe food portions are humongous and I think if you are an average eater, you can get one meal and split it with someone and both of you would walk out full and content.  The food is pretty good, I wouldn't say that it's the best--but again---you're paying for the experience.  The prices are a little bit higher than an average family restaurant but, hey---someone has to pay for the electricity that's used in lighting up those colorful neon lights.  =0)  The service has always been great every time that I've gone.  So, give the restaurant side a try.\n\nHowever--should you decide to pass the Peppermill Restaurant up---DO NOT pass up the opportunity to experience the Fireside Lounge.  Not everyone knows, but the Fireside Lounge was actually used in a scene for the movie Casino with Robert Deniro and Sharon Stone.  Apparently, Deniro hung out there during the filming of the movie and he liked it so much that they decided to use it as a scene in the movie.  Aside from the movie trivia attached to this lounge, the experience is truly unique.  I would say that it's quite romantic and great for dates and especially a first date.  If you end up getting a little toasty around the fire on the velvet red couches, there are other areas in the lounge that offer secluded areas for private conversation.  The area is pretty dim and it's got the nightlife feel to it.  So, give it a try!!  And take a few pictures for us!!!  \n\nYvette L. Brownstone from Ventura, CA"

One of my friends who is a born and raised Las Vegan said The Peppermill is a Vegas staple and we HAD to go because my other friend and I have never been. By the time we arrived it was around 2:30am. The restaurant was packed and there were at least three parties waiting ahead of us. We were starving so we asked if we could go into the lounge (located in a large room to the left of the main restaurant) and the hostess nodded, so we went and seated ourselves.\n\nThe ambiance is something else!! Probably the only positive about this place. Neon lights in a dark spacious room, with comfortable booths, a fountain, and surprisingly a lot of greenery. I felt like I was in a different decade.\n\nOur female server seemed annoyed and wasn't the friendliest when she greeted us. I don't think she smiled once. We ordered a few beers and appetizers as we could only order from the app menu in the lounge which we didn't mind. We got a round of blue moons and ordered crab cakes, ground beef nachos, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo chicken wings.\n\nA different server came by and asked if we wanted to start a tab. We closed out since we were mainly hungry and were good on our beers. It didn't take too long for the food to come out (20 min?) and we were excited to chow down. \n\n- Crab Cakes; Average, nothing special. I think we got 4 of them and they came with a creamy sauce \n- Buffalo Chicken Wings; Lukewarm but the buffalo sauce was delicious! Came with carrots and celery per usual\n- Nachos; HUGE portion. Had cheese, jalape\u00f1os, black olives on top. The cheese was cold and dry. They gave us a separate bowl of beans and another of the ground beef. Not sure why they wouldn't just top off the nachos with the two. Also came with guac, pico, and sour cream. \n-  Mozzarella Sticks; The most disturbing part of my experience. I bit into the cold mozzarella stick and out came a long strand of lighter hair. I was grossed out but know that these things happen. When I reacted to this hair in my mouth, my other friend laughed and said the one she bit into earlier had a hair in it too but just took it out. Hair in two mozzarella sticks out of five...?\n\nWe were having a fun night and didn't really want to take the effort to complain. The mozzarella sticks weren't good so if they offered to bring us a new batch, we would have declined. Also, I don't believe a single server came by to our table after we paid for our tab and received our food. Also not worth hunting down service.\n\nNeedles to say the food and service here is poor in my opinion, however, the ambiance in the lounge is very neat. If I were to ever come back, I would probably go for a drink at the bar in the lounge just to enjoy the neon lights."

The portion size is worth what you pay, though. \n\nThe atmosphere is typical Las Vegas. A lot of neon lighting and mirrors. Very \"glamorous\" motif as you would expect for Vegas. \n\nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience! I enjoyed my night out!"

Portions are definitely huge (especially pancakes) but prices reflect that so its not like you're getting some great deal.  Service was pretty slow with long waits to order and to get our food (simple breakfast stuff like french toast and omelets), food coming out at different times, and another wait to get the check.  Food was merely OK.  Our group had french toast (recommended by an employee, but nothing special at all), a fruit plate (very big), oatmeal (pretty good, but $11 for oatmeal?!?!), a caesar salad, and an omelet.  \n\nThe atmosphere is fine, but not as fun as I thought it might be from the other reviews.  \n\nNo one was impressed.  Big portions doesn't make up for mediocre food.  Maybe other food is better, but breakfast wasn't."

Homey, delicious, friendly.\n\nTHE DECOR:\nBeing inside is like stepping direcrly into a neon lined disco ball. There is disco glass all over the pillars and ceilings, only to be distracted by the giant TV screens and neon lighting lining everything. There is a cool lounge in the back area, but we opted for the bustling brunch in the restaurant in the front. Think Denny's on a flamboyant gay cruise in the 80's and you kinda have Peppermill, except with fantastic food and gigantic portions.\n\nI fell in love with the decor big time. Each table is a booth, which I love, and has big leather couches. It's arranged so you aren't hidden, but each table has their own little alcove. Like a buncha totally-visible secret gardens or something. Maybe i say garden because there are giant fake trees throughtout, and flowers and vines at each table draping down from the ceiling. Also, big flamingo Tiffany's -esque lamps hover over each table with a full moon, making it almost seem like you're watching a flock of flamingoes grazing at night. It's almost peaceful. \n\nTHE FOOD:\nThe coffee, so necessary after any 1/2-decent night out in Vegas, is Columbian and served in a big cup with free refills. All about it.\n\nMy friends and I shared:\n1) Munch's breakfast, which was saut\u00e9ed peppers, onions, and linguica sausage over hash browns with 2 eggs any way on top. It was good, and huge, but nothing to write home about.\n2) Maserati omelette - this is Meaty-tomato italian sauce, melted jack and cheddar cheeses, hasbrowns. Served with toast, a bagel, or a muffin. This was fantastic. I would never think that spaghetti sauce would pair well with an omelette, but this was excellent and worth ordering. \n\nWith your meal comes a free 4x6 photo souveneir -- so cheezy, so Vegas, so perfect. I loved it and treasure it as a memory of that weekend.\n\nFinally, there's colored sugar. I know, whoopee, but it just tells you what kinda place this is. It's vegas. there are no rules. have fun and roll with it!\n\nIn all, we spent $44 for 3 coffees and 2 breakfast meals and tip. A bit pricy but perfect for sopping up your last night and making you a functional human being again.\n\nWill definitely be adding this to my Vegas rotations."

Obviously, I can't give it higher than three stars because it's so cheesy, but I still love it. You enter through a standard diner (with pretty good cholesterol-heavy food) into a pink-and-blue-neon low-ceilinged room with a fire pit in the center. It's like passing from \"Alice\" into \"Fantasy Island\" to complete the '80s feel. I will give them points for the place always seeming very clean even though it's cluttered and hasn't been updated in an age (which is sort of the point). The plastic flower garland hanging everywhere isn't dusty and the cocktail servers in long black skirts slit up to the ying-yang are busy polishing the brass railings and plumping the cushions when not bringing drinks. The drinks aren't very good and tend to the sweet side on the cocktail menu. Hilariously, when I was last there, my buddy ordered a gin & tonic and the waitress asked, \"Would you like olives with that?\" He was a bit taken aback, but said, \"No, typically it comes with a twist. Gin and tonic, right?\" The waitress acknowledged the order and when she went to the bar, he turned to me and said, \"I will bet you money I'm about to get a gin martini.\" Sure enough, he got a giant glass of gin with a twist of lemon it in. Thus was born the new drink, a Gin & Tonic-Hold the Tonic. This was a pretty basic fail, but it only makes you love the place more. It's kind of like your slightly mentally-challenged child--you can't help but have affection despite its issues.\n\nSour note: Since smoking is allowed, when there are various trolls puffing away at the bar, the low ceilings can make the smoke pretty oppressive."

Lots of mirrors, plants, and neon lights. Beyond that there was nothing very special about his bar. Their signature giant drink was much smaller than its reputation. A limited bar menu is also available in case you don't want to drink on an empty stomac. It was relatively quiet insided so you didn't have to yell at the top of your lungs in order to have a conversation.\n\nI think there are better bars/lounges with better value, drinks, and food."

It's neon, but quiet and the other lights are low, so even in the heat of the day, you feel calmer just being inside the Peppermill.  I also love the colored sugar.  Call me crazy, but it's fun.  \n\nThe food is great here. I can count the number of BLT's I've liked in my life on one hand and the BLTA (avocado) at the Peppermil is one of them.  I get mine on rye, because rye is the best.  Fruit cups.  How many of us sigh at the fruit cup option?  They always suck, right?  Not here! The Peppermill fruit comes in a good sized bowl and includes strawberries, banana blueberries, grapes, and melon.  Yum!  Love the cottage cheese, love the chicken strips, love the Reuben.  \n\nIf you don't like any of these things, don't worry, the menu has a lot of options.  I'll bet you find something you like too."

I'm glad we did pop in and check them out, because this was a very positive experience. \n\nThe decor is much nicer than one would expect from just looking at the outside of the place, and it was full of patrons once you got into the dining area. Because this is Vegas, in addition to the normal waitstaff (busboy, and waitress) they also have cocktail waitresses who stop by your table to take any alcohol orders you might want to place. We went for breakfast, so it was a bit early for me- but hey, it's Vegas! Plenty of people were drinking at 9:30 in the morning. \n\nI had the oatmeal, which comes with a lot of toppings, and bacon. My wife had the two egg breakfast with bacon. We were both pleased with our meals, I will certainly plan on eating here again. They offer everything on their menu 24/7, so you can have breakfast, lunch, or dinner no matter time of day you show up. I like that. I like that a lot. \n\nThere is a very cool looking bar in the back with some very cool sunken seating areas. It looked very interesting, hopefully next time I come it will be at least noon so I can have a drink with a clear conscience!"

The retro feel is pretty cool too. We all got ourselves a French toast collage each and a big bowl of oatmeal to share cuz... why not? LOL! Huge portions here! Obviously, it was way too much food, but we stuffed ourselves anyway. Everything was prepared well, but the French toast wasn't the absolute freshest or softest I've ever had. Service is also kinda meh. What didn't help our hanger was them telling us it's a 20-25 minute wait and it becoming over an hour wait. We found out (the hard way) that they have two separate lists--one for small parties and one for large parties. We were a small party (3) and kept hearing other people being called, all the while they kept telling us there were only 2 parties ahead of us. That said, try to avoid peak times!!!"

The lounge had enough people to take up the chairs around the 1 fire pit they had but besides that, pretty much no one. The food if I may quote another yelper is like overpriced Denny's food. The service sucked in both the restaurant  and lounge. So in the restaurant they have the food runner ask your drink order but if you order alcohol then the waitress has to take that order. I guess the food runner's not allowed to serve alcohol or she just wasn't old enough to serve alcohol I'm assuming. Anyhow, that was kind of annoying. Not too mention the waitress took forever to actually come over to take that order, then forgot a drink. The lounge sucked too. Kind of dirty as in the couches you sit on and the floor. We went in and sat ourselves and waited and waited but no one asked if we wanted drinks. So I went to the bar and ordered our drinks which were kind of pricey and didn't have much alcohol in them. As I pull out my lil wad of money I could see the cocktail waitress standing to the left of the bar eyeballing and giving me a dirty look. Probably cause I went to the bar myself but hey, if you snooze you loose chick. Should have taken our order when we walked in. I gave em 2 stars cause it wasn't horrible and since it does serve food 24 hours a day. I just didn't feel it was worth my money or time. I really not sure why they have 4 stars on yelp. Maybe their breakfast is good I guess.  I more then likely won't be coming back unless I can't get any late night food somewhere else Vegas. Then maybe I'd think about it."

It's basically a large 1970's diner decorated in a \"disco Vegas\" style. \n\nThe menu is large, but many opt for the 24 hour breakfast. I ordered something called the San Jose breakfast bowl, though trough would be more appropriate, it is large and heavy and contains scrambled eggs, sausage, beef, onions, spinach, cheese served over hash browns. It was very tasty, especially the potatoes...I could only finish about 1/3 of it and was not hungry again all day. Interesting staff and nice melange of customers for people watching."

The highlight of this last trip to the Peppermill for me was the purchase of the rainbow turbinado sugar and sugar dispenser. I was asking the waitress about it when she informed me that I could purchase it! I WAS THRILLED! I got a 5 lb. bag of it complete with the dispenser. Best impulse purchase ever. The Fireside Lounge is also great to grab a drink while you wait for a table. The Peppermill is ALWAYS packed. Mimosas from the Fireside Lounge are on point! Must do."

Joseph, our driver, took us all over the strip and then down town. We were having such a great time getting to know our surroundings and chatting it up with our driver. He asked us if we wanted to see something really cool. We said \"Yes\". He pulled up in the back of a small parking lot by a dumpster and -I promise- for a split second I was worried he was some crazy dude that was going to harvest and sell our organs on the black market -delivering us in this poorly lit parking lot in the back of an old building that says PEPPERMILL in colorful neon lights to the corrupt doctors and bad guys and less than sterile extraction devices... But like any horror film, against our better judgement, we follow the leader through the back door of the puppymill PEPPERMILL...  we walk in through the back, enter this room filled with fake trees, bright pink couches and pillows and a smoking atmosphere... no, literally... you can smoke in here. There's a beautiful fire pit lounge with blue flames. The waitresses there are dressed in long black gowns and smiling faces. The cocktails are priced well-- the company was established 72 years ago... totally cool feel. It's like you're in an old movie with mobsters relaxing and sipping on gin... except most people are tourists in there. Beau and i didn't order any food, though I've heard it's perfect for late night snacks. Our drinks were great but the atmosphere was awesome. So perfect for the feel of the restaurant. You never would have guessed that the interior would have contrasted to greatly from the exterior. Super cool place. And then we thanked our driver that we got out alive... ;-)"

Saturdays and Sundays are only for the ones with time to waste as the wait can be an hour. Once seated they move it along pretty good.

It seems like on every episode of Holly's World they're hanging at The Peppermill. Unfortunately, she wasn't there when we went. BUT I'm sooooo glad we checked this train-wreck of a restaurant out. It's Denny's on crack. \n\nAfter going here, I can honestly say I know what being like Lindsey Lohan must feel like. Let me help you imagine this place a little better. Take your average Denny's or IHop, sprinkle in some meth and blow, add some 60 year old ex-strippers, angry foreign tourists, mirrored ceilings, neon lights and a haze from extra-smoky cigarette smoke.\n\nThe food is GIANT....you'll feel like you're on an episode of Pee-Wee's Playhouse when you get your food. The waitresses look like they hate their life and could give a flying F that you think your ice cream sundae is amazing! (Cheer up ladies....you work in a crazy place!)\n\nIf you want an amazing experience and crazy pictures to go along with it....go here. It's my new favorite place in Vegas.

I saw my idol Tony Bourdain meander his way here and I was hooked. I took my first glance of the Peppermill's interior and I was obsessed. Am I a coke-fueled old school glam slam Vegas princess? ...Maybe. But I sure do love this place!\n\nThe food is generally hit or miss, but believe you me the portions are GIGANTIC. You should either probably split a selection with somebody else in your party or prepare for a ridic amount of leftovers. You have been warned.\n\nMy two favorite dishes here are the seafood omelette (Mediterranean I think it's called) and the Corned Beef Hash with basted eggs and all the fixins. Again, we aren't talking Michelin-star quality, but the ingredients are definitely fresh, plentiful, and made to your liking.\n\nBut the absolute best part of the Peppermill? C'mon... the entire joint is draped in mirrors, fake foliage, year-round multi-colored Christmas lights, neon trim lighting, and a dark carpeting fit for a fab downtown casino floor. The lounge itself -- which looks deceivingly large thanks in large part to those mirrors -- is a trip, and definitely one of my top ten Vegas landmarks in my heart.\n\nThat single fire pit is captivating, sexy, mysterious, and gaudy all at once -- and I promise one glance and a slippery lil drink between your fingers, and you'll fall truly madly deeply in love like I have. Everyone is also very sweet, and although some have mentioned the spotty service, I've experienced nothing but the utmost courtesy and efficiency.\n\nDon't let the place fool you. Get in here, be prepared to eat, be especially prepared to fall head over heels for the Peppermill. My kinda Vegas."

We were very disappointed to learn that cigar smoking, as of recent, is no longer allowed in the Fireside Lounge (only low grade tobacco that you inhale through your lungs in the form of a cigarette is allowed). A friend in our party was informed of this after he had already lit up a fine cigar! Given this change in the smoking policy, I'm not sure we (or those we know) will be making a return to visit.

Actually we walked by it a few times (we stayed at the Hilton about a block away) and I did wonder what the story was with the place...there is something so non-descript and mysterious about it.  Curiosity solved - we came for breakfast on Sunday morning, whole place is packed with a crowd waiting at the slot machines. Wait doesn't take long though. Look around and everyone is drinking  Bloody Marys.  I had the Tequila Sunset and French Toast with fruit and boysenberry syrup - delish! My husband had the chorizo eggs with refried beans, also very good.  Overall, Peppermill is a great diner and the quintessential Vegas experience.

It's open 24 hours and serves three meals all day. \n\nThey have silly tropical cocktails which I didn't try. \n\nI was a bit adventurous and tried a salad with pear-cilantro vinaigrette which I didn't like. It was far too sweet. The chicken and blue cheese very good but I was in agonizing pain from being out with my luggage and unable to reach Vdara. \n\nIt reminds me a bit of Esau's in Santa Barbara at roughly the same price point.\n\nMen (or lesbians) will enjoy the outfits: it's kind of a Jamie Lee Curtis Trading Places Heidi get-up. \n\nP.S. I didn't go to the fire pit but everyone seems to enjoy that."

Boy, the pancake was huge and the whole meal was delicious.  The photographer comes around and take photos for free.  The 2 frames and photos are $20.00 which is a great deal.  By the time we finished there was a long line of people waiting for a table. I love this place."

The restaurant is like visiting a dark Denny's on acid, but with much better food. After you're full, you need to check out the Fireside lounge in the back. Cozy up on a red velvet couch and wait for a stripper to come sit on your lap, although if a girl does sit on your lap, it's probably not a stripper since the place only looks and feels like a boobie bar, but really isn't. I always make at least one late night trip to the Peppermill whenever in Vegas for grub and a cocktail or two..."

I had the NY steak and eggs so the portions that everyone was talking about didn't correlate with my meal since my steak is weighed.  Though, the hash browns seam a bit stingy now that I think about it.  My wife ordered a San Fran scramble.  That portion was big.  We took it home in box.  Our waitress was fast to take our order and serve us.  She asked if I needed a coffee refill and said it would be refilled.  I did't know this was done by someone else as I finished my meal to stop the young man, who also sat us, to refill me.  I was irritated by not having my coffee refilled during my meal.  A lady gave us a complimentary photo.  Another lady came by and asked if we wanted cocktails.  So, two things are preventing me from giving this place 4 stars which are:  small portion of hash browns and the wait for a coffee refill."

I can't hold too much against the place, but watching what had to be the most awkward romantic failures was somewhere between unbearable and utterly amusing.\n\nThe cocktails are another story. The Singapore Sling was fairly average. Some people might appreciate that, but I consider it a sin. Their gimlet tasted like drinking pure sweetened lime juice. The cocktails weren't horrifyingly expensive, but they were so weak and unimpressive that it just fell apart. The waitress was nice. Second star for her and the atmosphere."

Not too bad on drink prices as it was about $5 for a can of Guiness and $7 for a Mixed Drink. Since this place is a Vegas icon, it is worth stopping in to check out the firepits and some of their \"girly\" drinks are pretty famous as well. Entrees are expensive and you can only get appetizers at the bar area. The deserts are not homemade, but the carrot cake was a decent rendition. Worth the trip to see what life was like back in the Vegas glory days (AKA before the Ferris Wheels started arriving in town)."

            "review": "On Monday July 25 2016 at 12:30 pm, Myself along with four friends decided to dine at The Peppermill Lounge in Las Vegas. We are from Maryland and decided to visit this restaurant after seeing great online reviews. This is probably the only vacation we will have for the upcoming year so we wanted to indulge. We had no idea we would be so disappointed.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant it was quite busy, that was completely understandable due to the population. The hostess was taking names and party sizes to be placed on a waiting list. I asked another patron about the wait who advised it was at least 15 minutes. Once at the front of the line a friend and I waited patiently for the hostess to acknowledge us. After about 10 minutes, were still not acknowledged. However, a female patron approached the hostess while we were standing there waiting and she was acknowledged. I guess I was born the wrong sex. The hostess proceeded to ask the woman her name and party size. Before the woman could respond my friend spoke up and stated that we had been waiting to be put on the list for some time now, he stated his name and our party size.\n\nThe hostess then stared at us in a rude manner, as if we did something wrong. We patiently waited for her to acknowledge us but we had to be the ones to initiate the communication to be added to the list and seated.\n\nAfter waiting 30 minutes, our party of five was seated in the dining area. The server greeted us and delivered 3 waters to our table. Keep in mind, It was 98 degrees outside, a little warm in the room and we had a party of 5. We advised our server multiple times that we needed two more waters to accommodate our party of five. The server then immediately blamed the busboy. We were not trying to be confrontational, we just wanted 5 waters as we had a party of 5. Eventually after asking multiple servers and busboys we got the two remaining waters which took way too long.\n\nUpon resolving the initial hostess and water issue, we were approached by a bar attendant. The attendant asked us if we would like to order any alcoholic beverages, we replied Yes. \n\nI ordered a Pina Colada. When my drink arrived, I took one sip and instantly experienced a taste that reminded me of sour milk. After taking a sip of the unsettling beverage I called over the waitress.\n\nI explained my concerns with the drink, she then advised me that the drink could not be exchanged but they could attempt to fix the sour taste. She stated that there was nothing she could do and sent over a manager.\n\nThe manager, I believe her name was Peggy advised me that they could only attempt to fix the drink and could not make me anything different in exchange. She then chuckled as she said \"You knew what it would taste like\". I replied, I have never had a Pine Colada taste like sour milk. She then said she would be removing the drink from my bill, but wasn't very nice. I guess I was supposed to just deal with the taste of sour milk in the prepared Pina Colada.\n\nAfter getting that issue resolved our server delivered our food, but failed to accommodate our condiment request. We made six different request for syrup and by the time it was delivered our French toast and waffles were cold. In addition, three of our meals came with muffins which we did not get until we were ready to leave almost 45 minutes later. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had and will never forget the treatment we received.\n\nOverall, the food was ok, but it came out late and incomplete. I felt totally insulted by the manager who chuckled as she said \"You knew what it would taste like\" in regards to the Pina Colada. I've had many Pina Coladas and they've never tasted like sour milk or resulted in a stomach ache. I almost feel like there was malice behind it tasting the way it did, and that's unacceptable! \n\nI felt discriminated against when trying to be seated, as me and my party was overlooked by the host, but other parties were helped. 3 parties that arrived after us were seated before us to be exact. Not to forget about the attitude we received when we initiated the communication to be seated. As a restaurant goer, I am totally disappointed in The Peppermill Lounge and will make it my business never to return to this establishment. I will also spread the word to family and friends.\n\nIn addition my friends who also bought alcoholic beverages stated the drinks had a weird taste. They also wanted to return there drinks but due to the managers comment they just paid for them without drinking them."

My only gripe is that my salad wasn't removed after I finished it.\n\nI will surely return another day for more fine comfort food!"

I'm giving it 2 stars because it wasn't terrible, but it definitely was NOT good. \nMy girl friends and I stumbled into this place at 5 or 6am after my bachelorette party because our cabbie recommended it and it was right next to the Riviera where we were staying. \n\nUs: Can we walk back to Riviera in our heels from there?\nCabbie: Girl, you can CRAWL.\n\nNuff said. Let's go THERE.\nWe got a wide variety of stuff- corned beef & hash, biscuits & sausage gravy, buffalo chicken wrap, something else, and something else (sorry, the night was a bit hazy haha). We tried a bite of everyone else's food, and not one of us 5 girls were the least bit impressed. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'll go to the 24 hour Indian place inside Riviera if I'm hungry in the middle of the night/morning. Too bad I didn't find out about it until my last 2 hours there."

The twist comes from the funky mirrored/neon interior and the short skirted waitresses. The food was more expensive than the breakfast buffet at the hotel next door, but the staff was friendlier and the food significantly better. If you are not staying in the northern end of the Strip it is not worth the effort to go out of your way for the Peppermill. If you happen to have the 'good' fortune to stay at the Riviera, plunk you food dollars at the Peppermill."

I had read somewhere that this place was quintessential Vegas...and they were not kidding. Bright lights, booths, fire pits, 80's music, mirrors...and fake flower arrangements...it had it all!! We were also surprised that they had 1/2 price beer specials...so we took advantage of that and ordered some chicken quesadillas which were ok...on a pinch.

What I didn't like is that there is a cocktail waitress and a food waitress. You can't order drinks unless you order them through the cocktail waitress and her tail was nowhere to be found. We ordered the sampler platter and split it. It was HOT and the same quality of Applebee's (yes, put your nose in the air food snobs!) I was hungry and it hit the spot. Friendgirl thought it was really good, but I think that she was just hungry too, although she tends not have the discerning palette that I have. Would I come back, nope because Denny's is next door and I would have rather had that. It's okay if you just need something quick and inexpensive, but with so many restaurants on the strip......"

I usually ask what they would recommend, the responses have always been pretty good! At least the servers know which of  their food taste good!  \n\nDrinks are served by ladies in an evening dress!

But when I walked in, it was literally just a restaurant with a really small waiting area and a bar in the back. We came for brunch on a Sunday and it was packed...we waited around 30 minutes for our seats. \n\nRight when we sat down, a cocktail waitress came by and asked us if we wanted any drinks from the bar. And when you look around you, everyone's ordering cocktails or a drink from the bar. I'm guessing that's how they make their money. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor is definitely something else...super retro. With purple and blue and pink colored booths and table. After we got seated, our waiter didn't come by until 10 mins later. We got a crab cakes as an appetizer. I ordered the Joe's San Francisco Special and my boyfriend ordered the Pancakes with bacon and eggs. \n\nMy dish was definitely huge. It had scrambled eggs, spinach, sausages, onions, and a type of sauce. It was placed on top of a layer of hash browns. I think the dish was definitely overwhelming. Because everything just looked like a big blob of mess, I got full after eating 1/4th of the dish. The hash browns were definitely crispy and good! But the scrambled eggs and everything in it was too mushed together. I wish it was made separately rather than throwing it all in together. ($13)\n\nMy boyfriend's dish was good! The pancakes were a bit too crumbly. But other than that, the bacon and eggs were good! Like a regular breakfast plate. ($13)\n\nThe crab cakes were ok. Nothing too special. It came with a spicy mayo sauce. The display wasn't very nice. Looked like they just threw on a lettuce and put the crab cakes on and sprinkled it with some green onions. Not worth! ($9)\n\nAll in All, this place is ok. Its like a bit fancier than the Denny's right next door. And definitely not worth the wait."

Be patient. \n\nI've never felt rushed here, nor have I ever sent my food back for any reason. (but I don't generally do that anyhow.)\n\nThe portions are HUGE. (This is my only issue with the place, my sister actually asked them if they could give her a 1/2 portion on a TEN EGG OMELET and she'd pay full price (she just didn't want to waste food) and was told no, they won't cut portions, even if your paying full price.)\n\nI read a bunch of the reviews here before writing mine... Some of the complaints are really unfounded, like \"one dimensional\" Whats that about? Someone else said \"over priced\" Are you serious? Apparently we didn't eat at the same place. The food is very reasonably priced and I can't ever finish what I order.\n\nThe only thing I don't like? The Sausage gravy, but that's a personal preference, my guy really likes it.\n\nThe spicy bloody mary's are TO DIE FOR! I recommend going and getting one in the fire side lounge, they taste better when the bartender makes them for you rather than the cocktail waitress ordering them for you en mass. The bartender asks what kind of vodka, and how spicy and if we wanted salt, where as the cocktail waitress just asks if you want it spicy or not."

Yeah, I know what a bad margarita tastes like and I know at almost  $10 a pop that shit better taste good.  So I was really pissed when the server wouldn't take the drink back.  She said that's why they suggest the 50 cent upgrade when they take your order.  I'm sorry, shouldn't a $9 margarita taste pretty good to begin with?  I asked her if i decided to upgrade would the bartender just pour the shot on top of my already crappy margarita and she said YES!!!  At this point,(when i thought I wouldn't be getting my money back) I said sure throw some more tequila(and possible spit from the bartender) on my shitty drink.

She explained that it is their policy not to return drinks and that's how it is at most places on the strip, but she was kind enough(and seeing that i had barely touched the drink) to take the drink off the bill.  I don't want to write off the Peppermill because it is fun and kitschy.  I just know that i won't order  a margarita there."

I love how it's unique and is all about the neon lights. The food is so yummy and the portions are big. 3 of my friends and I started off sharing an order or nachos and WOW! Big portion. We didn't finish it because it was so much and had forgotten all about our individual entr\u00e9e. I ordered the Pesto Chicken sandwich. When I saw it I was full just by looking at it but of course I ate as much as I could and it tasted delicious. The service and vibe are great and everyone that eats there is friendly and fun. \n\nAfter dinner we went to check out the Fireside Lounge on the other side, my friend calls it the Swingers Lounge because it reminds you of something from the 70's with the dim lights, more neon lights and fire place. Different for sure.\n\nMake sure to stop by on your next Las Vegas visit."

Despite many trips to Vegas this was the first time I actually went in and had some food. I had forgotten there was also a location in Reno. It does always appear to be popular at all hours. I did find that all the bright colors and decorations did a lot to brighten my mood at 3am. I enjoyed some very large bloody mary's but despite the size they don't particulary stand out. This is a nice benefit over the all night places like this where I live, but I guess that's just a matter of state law. I was pretty happy with my bruschetta though, which is something that is not often on menus. My boyfriend enjoyed his food too, which I can no longer recall what it was, but I remember there was enough left over for us to share with the homeless man outside. It was a lively atmosphere and I will probably try it out again in the future. Good service even in the early morning."

We can here them. \"Its your turn!\" ... \"No, its your turn!\" ....  Im already getting a bad vibe.

The entire environment seemed to emit Vegas-style retroness with fake indoor palm trees, colorful sugar, and a disco-like vibe.\n\nSince I knew the portions would be huge, my boyfriend and I decided to share a meal. We decided to order the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (that comes with hash browns). In addition, since it was the morning and it looked like every other table ordered some, my boyfriend decided to order a BLOODY MARY to go along with the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. The cocktail waitress was very nice in explaining it to him since he didn't know how it worked. You actually get to choose the type of Vodka you would like in it and they use their own secret list of spices to be included. As for it being brunch time, in Vegas, you would have to be drinking every time of the day. \n\nMy cousin decided to order the PEPPERMILL SAMPLER (golden fried shrimp, breaded chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and batter dipped onion rings) for all of us to share. And that was the first thing that came out and man, did we have to share. The entire thing was huge. Sadly, I was only able to try the mozzarella sticks (which were very warm and gooey inside with cheese after being dipped into marinara sauce--yummy!) and an onion ring (I've had better elsewhere). The rest I left to the others in my group to try. \n\nMy boyfriend's BLOODY MARY came out next. Being his first time, it wasn't bad. I tasted it as well and it did taste like V8 with a little bit of Vodka with seasoning in it for better flavor. He actually finished the whole thing and was glad his first time was at Peppermill. \n\nFinally, our main entree came out, the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (with hashbrowns). It was super crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside and with that gravy on top made it even that much savory. The hashbrowns also had a nice top crunch to it which I love. \n\nOverall, we came out very stuffed. Luckily, since we shared, we were able to eat all of the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. I wouldn't have been able to if I went into this as a lone person. \n\nGreat first time experience. I can't wait to see what else Vegas has left for me."

At the conclusion of dinner the bill was presented at a certain amount. When at the cash registered the total amount then jumped significantly. They explained the late meal was never added to the check and that was the increase in price (indicating the meal was never sent to the kitchen, if that was the case the server should have honestly communicated and we would have canceled the meal.) nonetheless Marie the manager was a total bitch and insisted we pay which we did.

We had 4 (yes I'm not exaggerating) ask for our drink order from the bar! I get it that's a money maker. We order a bloody marry and it arrives 5 min later. It was ok. Nothing to write home about. \nOur waiter comes over and introduces himself (really laying it on thick for the tip no less) and again I get it! It Christmas and he's working so he might as well make money. But then he tells us to look over the menu and that hell be back in a few min! 20 min later after I've asked several of the bus boys to call over our waiter, he shows up and takes our order. I guess he could tell from my facial expression that I was pissed so he kept a smile on his face and took our orders fast. We order the appetizer sampler (fried shrimp, fried chicken fingers, onion rings, bruschetta, and cheese sticks), buffalo chicken wrap and nachos. The sampler was decent, the wrap too but the nachos were awful! I huge plate full of chips, a little bit of semi melted cheese, raw onions and a lot of black olives emptied from a can right on too!!!! It was just awful (baja fresh and la salsa have way better nachos). \nIt came with a side (small in comparison to how much chips was in the plate ) of sour cream and old (brown guacamole) for almost $16!!!!! \nSo we ate a little bit of this and that Just kind of picking on the plates and finally decided it was time to go! We asked for a few boxes and the check! The waiter comes back and is completely confused as to the drink we ordered. He kept asking us if we ordered a sunrise something and I kept telling him NO! That all we ordered was the bloody marry and it was still on the table. He tried to help us pack the nachos and just broke the chips by pushing it down to try to make it fit. On our check we were charged for the sunrise something and I wanted to flag the guy down and tell him but my husband was so over it that we just paid and left!\n\nAll in all, go here only if you're hungover, have the munchies or don't care AT ALL what you put into your body! I can't for the life of me figure out all these good reviews. I'm usually very easy going but that was one of the most awful experiences in a restaurant /diner that I've had with both food and service. You're only paying for the decorations/ ambiance! \nDon't waste your time and money here. There was way better local places to try! The 2 stars are for the ambiance and cute colored sugar on the table! That's it!!! Good luck!"

She wanted breakfast food, and I wanted something with meat and fries and maybe some greens to make me feel like I'm eating \"healthy.\" Not a problem. Peppermill's menu has a good amount of tasty options.\n\nTangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap: I ordered this wrap which comes with the choice of either curly fries, regular fries, and onion rings. I chose curly fries because I can't remember a time when I went to a restaurant where that was an option. I think wraps can be hit or miss, but this was a hit.  I was really diggin' the combination of the spicy chicken and the mixed greens and house made ranch dressing. The curly fries were crunchy, greasy, and delicious.\n\nThe service is decent, though slow. We waited quite a while for our food to arrive, but the wait is worth it considering how good the food is and the generous portions you receive. \n\nPeppermill's location is on the sketchy side of The Strip, but the parking lot is well-lit and there is security that patrols the area. \n\nThe prices here are more than the typical 24-hour diner-style establishments, but it's worth it.

You get one photo for free (a souvenir style with your photo placed amongst a collage of the Peppermill) and then you can purchase additional full size photos. As for our food, I truly enjoyed my steak. I asked for medium rare, and it was tasty, but could have used a bit less cooking - I enjoyed it though. Fettuccine was awesome.

The coffee is drinkable, and the waitresses were the usual skimpy outfits, which can kinda suck when the waitress really shouldn't be wearing skimpy outfits.  Oh yeah, and it's got neon lights, to distract you from the fact that it's still not much better than Kady's, which I gave 2 stars.  \n\nThe portions here are massive, so if you need a good hangover cure after a night of heavy drinking, this will surely fill you up and grease you up.  \n\nHowever, if it is possible to venture out a little further, and wait for a good meal, the nicer hotels tend actually have decent breakfasts, so long as you avoid the buffets."

What's NOT to like?!\n\nOk, maybe the Vegas locale, on the north end of the strip and away from the more posh atmosphere of Tao and a million Wolfgang Puck spinoffs, isn't for everyone. But then again, Peppermill is right across the street from Circus Circus and right next to the Riviera, and away from the worst of the Strip traffic.\n\nMy girlfriend and I went to Peppermill on the recommendation of a friend, someone who lives here in Las Vegas, always a good sign. Once you enter the place, you're immediately struck by a cunning mix of modern and retro, neon lighting in a darkened room, and waitresses in bright colours and miniskirts. \n\nWe were seated quickly and immediately introduced to our waitress, who was friendly and helpful, and soon followed by the cocktail waitress, dressed to the nines in a flowing black dress but still very comfortable. She helped us choose drinks and returned with them fast, checking on us several times throughout the meal.\n\nMy girlfriend got a grasshopper and I tried a Blue Hawaiian, big and fruity and bright blue - it also packed a good kick. No watering down here, I guess!\n\nFor our meals, she tried the pork chops and eggs, which came with a generous portion of hash browns and a muffin, while I tried the pastrami burger with (I was delighted to find) curly fries. We finished off with an \"Elegant Brownie,\" a positively massive dessert of warm brownie, hot fudge, and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and a cherry. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection - a little bit of pink in the middle of my medium burger, eggs with just slightly runny yolks, crispy fries and hashbrowns, and a delightfully messy dessert that was plenty for two to share.\n\nAnd the whole meal, drinks and dessert included, came in at just about $50 all told. Not bad at all for a wonderful experience and a whole lot of great food.\n\nIf you're in Vegas, you owe it to yourself...it may be a little off the main drag, but the Peppermill is well worth the trip. As for us, we'll be back!"

If the tables were bolted to the floor, you'd swear you were on the S.S. Celebration. And that's a good thing, in my book.\n\nWhen we first moved to Vegas in the late '90s, we would bring every out-of-town guest here. I'm not sure when that tradition fell by the wayside, but it's time to reinstate it.\n\nAlthough we probably haven't been back in five years or more, nothing has changed since my first visit. Same gaudy decor. Same '70s music. Same great diner food. And, as far as I can tell, same prices. It may be a bit steeper than other places in town, but the prices are a steal for the Strip and the portions are so huge that you can pull two or even three meals out of one entree.\n\nThat was certainly the case for my Cobb salad, which was just as big -- and delicious -- as I remember it. I ate a quarter of it for dinner and had leftovers for three more meals! My husband ordered The Conquest, which is a glorified roast beef sandwich, with a side of onion rings. I think they may have changed the recipe on the rings -- they seem to be more panko-y and less beer batter-y -- and the portion seemed bigger than in the past. But they were great, and as I said before, they may be the only thing that's changed since 1998.\n\nAfter dinner, we stopped in the lounge for a cocktail. Visiting the lounge is an event in itself. More mirrors, more neon, and a circular fire pit to entertain you and your date while you soak up the vibe. I usually get a mai tai, but I was so stuffed from dinner that I got something a little lighter: a Chambord lemon drop martini. It was a little sweet for my taste, but my husband's pineapple mojito was pretty tasty. And, once again, the prices were on par or lower than other bars on the Strip: less than $20 for both. \n\nDo yourself a favor and take a step back in time next time you're on the Strip. The Peppermill is open 24 hours, so this hot tub time machine is always ready for a party."

The cook went to the back and read the box, and said it was 75% fat. Haha, ok. That doesn't exist in real life, so I asked the waitress if she could please check, even though I correctly suspected they meant 25% fat. The kitchen staff appeared to be overly annoyed that I even asked, let alone requested a second look. Excuse me for caring about what I put into my body. At any rate, 75/25 chuck? Not exactly what I was expecting based on their trumped-up description on their menu.\n\nI ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries. It was good, until a large glob of what appeared to be someone's spit dripped out of the bottom of my wrap. My stomach turned and I couldn't eat another bite.

Thankfully I spotted it before I bit into that area of the wrap!!!\n\nI told the waitress, and she tried her best to act surprised. She told the manager, who came over to defend her staff, and tell me over and over \"they don't do that\" there. Right. Angry employees spit in food everyday in all types of restaurants. The manager offered something else (no thanks, don't need more spat-upon dishes). But, she didn't seem apologetic, nor was she able to explain what it was, if not spit. What ingredient in a grilled buffalo chicken wrap is the consistency and color of someone's nasal drip? None.\n\nNothing more was said, they just removed it from the bill.

Also because they serve a delicious 16 ounce bone-in ham steak. They throw it on the grill to give it some char and it kills anything you'd get at IHOP or Denny's. \n\nI guarantee you won't see waitresses in Von Trapp family costumes and cocktail servers in black prom dresses back home, noble tourist. You won't be able to wait for your breakfast table while drinking a tequila sunrise and seated in a smoky lounge on a red velour sofa in front of a small lake of fire, either. You can even cure a hangover here.\n\nIf you want a taste of \"old Vegas\" at breakfast, just go."

I was immediate greeted by an exceptionally friendly hostess and seated promptly.\n\nI ordered a sausage, Swiss cheese and onion omelet, which came with has browns and a blueberry muffin.\n\nAs always, the peppermill way, my omelet was GYNORMOUSE and mouthwatering delicious and even the hash browns were quite tasty especially considering the fact that I'm not into hash browns.\n\nThe bar area is fantabulous!!! Dark secluded and intimate with a big fiery pit centered in the middle surrounded by an engaging lounge couch area. It  definitely is something worth checking out! You haven't fully experienced Vegas to the fullest with out stopping here; really, you just have to make this a destination point!! Can't wait tell my next visit!!!"

There were a few of slot machines (of course) crammed in a small corner, neon lights, cheap plastic plants, and waitresses wearing orthopedic shoes. Because the Restaurant sells drinks, they have a \"cocktail waitress\" who was dressed as if she were going to the prom (on a budget). \n\nWe were finally seated after waiting 45 minutes, it was Saturday around noon, so it was to be expected. The service here was not good. The waitress was unattentive and forgetful, however the food is THE BOMB!!!!!! I ordered to Lorraine Omelet and my hubby ordered some sort of scrambler. The food was seasoned to perfection and the portion sizes were ridiculous. I literally ate on my food for 2 days and wound up throwing it away. I ordered a pancake on the side and it was literally the size of a 20' rim.\n\nIf you are looking for great food with large portion sizes, this is the place. Although the service sucks (the lady at the checkout counter practically ignored us for a couple of minutes when we were ready to pay our bill), they make up for it with their food."

The interior is romantically dark, but with low, florescent lighting spanning throughout. The mirrors on the walls and ceiling really make you want to rent a kinky hotel room and get it on. The foliage that envelopes the interior adds a lovely exotic touch. The \"tables\" are actually large, low to the ground coffee tables, surrounded by big, squishy couches pushed back against a wall, so everyone gets their own, private grotto. Shall I even begin to talk about the bubbling blue flame pool that you can sit around? Awesome!! \n\nAnd let us not forget the drink menu. Typical bars and lounges in Vegas will serve up trendy, funny named drinks where, you have no idea what's in it, but with a name like \"Mouthfuck\", you just HAVE to drink it. Not so at the Fireside. Not only are the cocktails reasonably priced and STRONG, but they're the CLASSIC drinks that you would expect in Vegas. Not only did I recognize all of the drinks on the menu, but there were some drinks that are so classic and vintage that no one my age (25) has ever had them, so they're sort of trendy again. I had my very first Old Fashioned, and then followed that up with my first (of many) Champagne Cocktail. Honestly, Champagne Cocktail is where it's at!!\n\nThen of course is the music. True to old Vegas style, they play Dean, Frank, Sammy, Bing, etc. And then, to appease their younger generation, they play Beyonce, Justin, and whoever else is popular these days. However, the song selection and sound level is hardly offensive; indeed, it's quite mellow and chill, thereby allowing you to suckle upon your champagne cocktail, or other drink of choice, and engage in verbal and social intercourse which might then, if you are lucky, lead to other kinds of intercourse. Really.. this place is friggin awesome.\n\nBTW: The pic above is NOT the lounge... it's the adjacent restaurant"

The portions were big though and the food wasn't bad, it's just not the reason you come here really. Decent enough though. \n\nThe main attraction is the restaurant decor itself. I LOVED IT! The restaurant is filled with cherry blossom trees all over the place with pretty branches of flowers hanging above you. Coupled with neon lights, this just makes a picturesque environment.\n\nThe Fireside Lounge was AWESOME! It's a separate room from the restaurant in the back. Dim mood lighting with pinkness everywhere! Big comfy pink couches with the cherry blossom trees overhead as well. Wish I was able to stay and grab a drink but we just had breakfast... Haha I'll definitely be back to enjoy this lounge. There's also a fireplace pit surrounded by water. So cool!! \n\nThis is a great place with all the Vegas flair. Kindy tacky, kinda over the top, super themed, but so fun! I recommend everyone checking it out!"

            "review": "SERVER:  Our waitress CJ was THE BEST and made ALL the difference in our experience here!!  She is very knowledgeable of the food they serve & was spot on with her suggestions. Although she was busy, she was very warm, friendly and attentive.\n\nFOOD:  Eggs Benedict (as CJ said) was yummy!  \n\nI ordered the Western fruit plate / platter that usually comes with banana bread & marshmallow cream sauce which 1) I did not want and 2) they did not have, so CJ asked if I wanted a muffin or something in lieu. Of my choices, I  chose the lemon muffin which CJ said was really good and it REALLY was! Loved it!  The only thing....CJ could have warned me of the large amount of fruit that I had unknowingly ordered. Yikes! But so yummy!\n\nESTABLISHMENT:  Came across Peppermill via Yelp, and its old school Vegas charm & good reviews made us pick it as our late breakfast / lunch destination.\n\nHaven't been to Vegas for nearly 9 years now, I  initially thought the low ceilings, neon lights & crowd made this to be a wrong choice on our part.\n\nEven at 2 in the afternoon, it was crowded with a steady stream of people.  We were greeted right away, the gal took our name, told us it was about a 20 minute wait and said we could wait in the bar if we'd like. \n\nThe bar is to the left, separated from the dining area itself.  Thank goodness cuz it was a bit too smokey for our taste.  Cool bar area though!  Just a little to early in the day for us for that atmosphere.  (Yes, we're a little older in age.  Oh and I'm a former smoker.)\n\nWe waited in the entry area instead which is kinda small, with slot machines on one wall & a big support beam towards another wall.\n\nWe waited about 10-15 minutes before being called for our table. Because the hostess called two parties & we both approached the hostess desk, there was a little confusion about who she was taking to be seated.\n\nThere was a gal walking around offering to take a \"complimentary\" picture of us, but we declined.  She was nice, not pushy, but....no thanks.\n\nThere was a gal dressed in a long black dress (wait staff, hostess, cashier had uniforms), asking us for any drink orders.  Nice & attentive, remembered to check on us.\n\nSUMMARY:  Cool place to check out. Our waitress made our experience exponentially better.  Other staff was nice.  Food was yummy.  \n\nWould we go back again? Probably not.  But this review comes from a near 50, partied hard in my younger days but now I'm more into the wine & chill scene, kind of person.  \n\nWould we suggest people go check it out at least once? Definitely....and ask to sit in CJ's section.  ;-)"

Food was good, I asked and was told they use for each omelette 8 - 10 eggs! That's insane!  The nachos can probably feed 5 persons, my Focaccia Chicken Sandwich was not that big of a portion. was good. I would go back to the place."

I genuinely believe that this place has got to at least be a contender for top five diners in the U.S.!\n\nThe first time I ever came here, as soon as I walked through the door, I gasped in delight. I couldn't help myself. This is the prettiest diner you have ever seen!!! It's so beautius. The faux foliage with lights, the neon, the dim lighting... It all works so well together, and creates an overall classic retro, yet modernized feel. They have these cool flat screen TVs on the wall at one booth that flash to different scenes around the world. Really nifty to watch while you wait for your food. This place is maybe where say, a pimp might bring his bottom bit*h out for a semi-classy meal at 3am. I mean that in a good way, seriously.\n\nIf you have read the other reviews, then you already know: This is the place to come for some after-bar people watching. They get all kinds up in these parts. But everyone is so soothed by the wonderful interior ambiance and happily munching away at num nums that the times I have been there, I have not seen the typical drunk and angry bickering here.\n\nThe food is more expensive than your usual diner fare, but it's worth it. Not only is it all pretty much delicious, but you get large portion sizes too. I also love that you are serviced by the waitresses from the Fireside Lounge at your table, so if you wanna keep boozin' it up, that option is open to you. \nSpeaking of waitresses, all the ladies who work in the diner are wearing the cutest outfits!! I almost considered temporarily getting a job there, jut to get the outfit!\n\nI have never actually been to the Fireside Lounge part, but it seems like a must-do thing the next time I stop by. I can't wait!"

After a failed trip to Tacos El Gordo for a quick bite before we left town Monday morning, we decided to hop over here.\n\nThe decor is...funktastic, like a 1970's disco party.  You were definitely transported back in time, like the menu says, to how Vegas used to be.  \n\nEven on a Monday morning, business was good.  Thankfully, there was no wait for us because we were both famished and in a hurry to get on the road.\n\nPuzzle:  A sexy cocktail server takes your alcoholic beverage order while a more normal one (still cute, just showing less cleavage) takes your food and juice orders.  Everything ends up on the same bill anyway.  Just thought that was kind of odd. \n\nFood:  Pretty yummy.  Breakfast portions were generous except hubby's NY Steak and eggs was normal sized.  I got corned beef hash and eggs and realized I didn't get any hash browns with it.  However, I noodled it over and reasoned that the corned beef already had potatoes in it.  Just so used to other places giving you a side of hash browns, this sort of made sense.  \nMy dish was pretty greasy...rather than a patty of corned beef hash, it was bowl of mushy stuff, sitting in a lot of butter.  I did enjoy my breakfast but it got pretty salty and I tried to avoid the parts sitting butter.  Hubby said his steak was ok and eggs were well cooked.\n\nCool stuff:  Sugar dispenser contained multi-colored crystals which resembled those tube-like beads you used to make jewelry.  I could resist taking a teaspoonful and eating it like a kid.  Downside:  The dispenser had some crusty old gunk on it so it was a little gross to handle.\n\nService was very friendly and on-par.

It was like the restaurant was stuck in the 70's but I quickly got accustomed to the lights. Since i was by myself and I didn't want to sit at one of the large booths I sat at the counter. The waitress came over quickly with water and the menu and the woman who delivers drinks (holy cow!) came over to ask if I wanted anything from the bar. No draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of Corona. As I watched the dishes passed over from the chefs I couldn't believe how large the portions were. I ordered the Reuben and potato salad and couldn't finish it all. The sandwhich was very good and the potato sald was (not as good as Mom's) but decent. I would def go back there again."

They were not stingy with the portion. Hubby had the Philly cheesesteak and good portion of filling to bread. Waitress was attentive and smiling all the time. Glad we went at 5pm, the place filled up with people waiting by the time we finished our meal. Looks like a popular local spot. It was $32 with a soda and ice tea.  Today is 9/22/2013. This could almost be rated a 5."

The portions at the Peppermill are your usual over-sized-Vegas-scale heaps and the quality is neither stellar nor unpalatable; this place is all about the atmosphere.  What a surreal experience.  This place is both trashy and elegant all at once and while the cocktail waitresses wear these wonderfully ironic evening gowns, the place is like a gussied-up diner.  Very Tarantino.  Finish your obscenely large meal (my \"side\" caesar and fettuccine alfredo could have easily fed 2.5 adults... not going to count how many day's calories went  down the hatch on that one), then mosey on into the Fireside for a cocktail in what feels like an early 1980s Central American druglords's den.  I loved it!  It felt like a strip club without the strippers.  The music got so loud at some point that no one sitting with me could actually communicate within a normal decibel range, but I'm pretty sure we were crashing a private party, so I guess I shouldn't complain.  This was definitely a highlight to my Vegas experience."

Perhaps salad is to Vegas as kryptonite is to Superman; I can not tell you how many nights I am driving around thinking: \"Man, I would love a good salad.\" (This is not an invitation for salad jokes. I am serious.)\n\nFollowing some research, my first trip to the Peppermill was actually in search of a good salad, but every subsequent trip has been for the rather special ambiance. The salads are impressive: huge, fresh, and creative for a diner-type joint. Plus, in my experience, they grill up the most perfect chicken breast. Still, even if the salads were iceberg blah, I would have to make the occasional Peppermill journey to savor the fabulous interior complete with artificial cherry tree grove. Yes, it is best described as a grove. From the booths to the blossoms, you definitely feel as if you are experiencing something best described as Vintage Vegas as the place opened in 1972. The friendly servers in their equally vintage uniforms complete the experience nicely.\n\nIn addition to salads, the Peppermill does dessert and dessert-inspired cocktails well. They have an oatmeal cookie drink that tastes 100% like an oatmeal cookie. Even if you are not hungry, who can pass up that concoction? Even better, you can sip on your cookie in The Fireside Lounge located in the back of the restaurant. It features, and I quote, a \"romantic flaming pool\", and hot pink is the design scheme. Might as well call it \"heaven\".\n\nInsiders tell me that around 5am is when the best people watching occurs, but if you can't find an excuse to go at 5am, you should still find an excuse to go sometime."

This is served with 3 eggs, toast and hash browns for just $15.25 but be hungry, very hungry!!!!!!\n\nThe interior is so welcoming with bright neons yet trees, flowers and greenery throughout. The service both times has been excellent. Each time we had a 15 minute wait so be prepared and they did seat us in less which is a complement to a well run restaurant. Nothing is worse than a \"hangry\" guest being told 15 and it being 30!!!! That doesn't happen here...

They have the purple and pink tubing running all thru the interior, with some artificial trees hanging over the boothes. It was pretty frickin cool! They have TV's set about the place with some screen shots of different locations around the world. This was a bit wierd as it went from Bahamas(sweet!) to weeds in Beatty, Nv (???). Didn't exactly make sense, but still kinda cool.\n\nWe are seated in our booth and a guy comes to get our drink order. I order a Sierra Mist and my friend a water. They very promptly bring us 2 waters.lol okay. The waitress chuckled when I told her this and brought out my soda. No harm, no foul. Waitress is very nice and very attentive, which is especially appreciated considering how slammed they are during this time.\n\nI ordered the Masarati Omelette(12.95) and my friend ordered the Peppermill Omelette(also 12.95). Those things were freaking huge! lol They both came with an order of hash browns and toast. Damn, they were really tasty! Mine had ham and musrooms and tons of american and peperjack cheese in it with some Marinara sauce on the top. It was very different from any kind of omelette I had ever tried before and I must say it was scrumptious! \n\nThis was such a great experience and I can't wait to come back and try different things on the menu and check out the Fireside Lounge one of these days!\n\n4 solid stars."

Umm...maybe that was too much information...\n\nThis place is definitely a 70's disco hall converted into restaurant.  With neon pink lights and plenty of mirrors all around, you walk in wondering if you might be seeing some platforms and bell bottoms with the Bee Gees performing on a stage somewhere.  Unfortunately, there were none of those things to be found.  However, what they do have is pretty good food at very generous portions.\n\nUnluckily for me, I was starting to become more and more hung over by the second by this point in the afternoon but I felt it would probably be a good idea to get something in my stomach.  Being 4:00 in the afternoon I decided that breakfast would probably be the best call so I ordered up what ended up being I gigantic plate of eggs, potatoes, sausage, and other vegetables.  I tried in vain to gobble this down but I was definitely feeling nauseous by this point.

If you have a waffle $8.95 and make it a combo. They charge $13.50. A $4.55 charge for the same combo as the pancakes. I brought this to their attention and I was told that its their pricing and couldn't do anything. They have other pricing discrepancy on the menu as well. The manger asked if my meal was OK. I told her the truth that it was less than. She didn't seem to care or offer to make it better. Pricing here is on the high side, but you get Vegas casino feel.. I could of ate next door at Denny's for half the price. What they do give you is much larger portion. 3 eggs instead to 2. And the sausage links were fat and juicy. I don't know if that justifies the cost. I did mention the lack of service to the manager when leaving. And once again no response, not even a \"I'm sorry to hear that\". She just rolled her eyes.

First, let me say that I don't like diner food, I detest \"breakfast\" foods (pancakes, waffles, maple syrup, sausages, etc.: OMG vom) and \"traditional\" \"American\" food barely qualifies as food IMO. (Pizza, burgers and chow mein: now THAT's American! Meatloaf and steak & eggs: ICK!) So to say that this is not the place for me is an understatement. It IS, however, open 24/7 and near-ish my hotel.\n\nFirst trip: I ordered fettucine alfredo with shrimp. The portion size was not as big as a lot of places, but that's OK because it was gross. The sauce was gummy and didn't taste fresh, the few shrimp were large, but a little tough, and the noodles were not what you'd call al dente. The garlic bread with \"cheese\" on it was revolting.\nMy mum ordered the Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta. Hers was better than mine, though her penne was also overcooked. The sauce was pretty good, the red pepper strips were, I swear, Mezetta brand right out of the jar (but I like those), and they were right on the money when they described it as chicken stuffed with herbs and cream cheese; it tasted just like Philadelphia Cooking Creme Italian Cheese & Herb flavour.\nSecond trip: I ordered New York steak and Shrimp Scampi. I ordered it cooked medium, it was definitely well done. The shrimp were, too. My mother ordered some icky breakfast foods, so I didn't taste them, but she said they were OK.\nI think if you like breakfast foods (served all day) and diner food, you'll like this place, but I will avoid it. The waitresses were cute and helpful, though. And the decor is amusing."

Prices for breakfast can be steep in the hotel restaurants. Peppermill is an economical option because they give you big portion, like food-coma-big-portion. And it's open 24/7.\n\nIt's a diner alright, but with tacky decor. Think purple neon lights and trees inside. Waitresses clad in Hawaiian-theme uniforms. This is the big-eater haven, the greasy-spoon diner where you go to soak up the alcohol. That said, I only come here for breakfast.\n\n*Fruit Plate with Banana Nut Bread ($13.25): This is literally a basket full of fresh fruit--cantalope wedges, honey dew wedges, pineapples, grapes, strawberries and kiwis. You get a mini loaf of warm banana bread!  Skip the marshmellow sauce if its too heavy.\n\n*Tostada Omelet ($13.50): It certainly tastes better than it looks. It's a big plate of messy omelet with black olives, zesty beef and diced tomatoes. Looks like nacho. It comes with hash brown AND tortilla chips.\n\n*Sausage and Three Eggs ($11.95): Probably the smallest plate in the house and you can substitute Canadian bacon or ham. My scrambled eggs were okay-fluffy and the sausages are of the low-grade. Very greasy and fatty. Instead of toast I requested a blueberry muffin for a taste. It was steamy hot but chewy. Not very good.\n\n*Extraordinary Oatmeal ($9.50): Sprinkled with raisins, walnuts, and banana galore. Healthy option. \n\nIt's so much food that most people pack it up and take it to-go. If you want to challenge yourself, get the French Toast Collage with four wedges of French toasts, two eggs, two strips of bacon and hash brown. Eat yourself to a coma. Quantity certainly supersedes quality here. It's not bad but nothing mind-blowing. Service is quick and friendly. It's a no-frill place on the strip north of Wynn between Encore and Riviera. Crowd range from divey to genteel retired. Get here early or be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes after 10."

There was some kind of mishap in the kitchen, though, with my dish taking the longest to arrive.  Our waitress was very good about getting the sandwich comped because of the delay and the head chef also came by our table to apologize.   \nDepending on the time of day you come, there will be a wait, so be prepared since this is a popular place.

So I looked on yelp and read your reviews and I figured yes we will eat here. Turned out it was close by and we walked over from the Hilton Resort. Turned out this place is like a Denny's but with tripple the price tag and the portions larger. We all ordered breakfast and I would say we all enjoyed our breakfast. The place had a few roudy people but it was a good place to hang-out. The only thing that I would recommend is to be able to move the table out a little because I felt I was in a tight booth.  \n\nAs we left the place I wanted to check out the pool of fire but that was in another section and it was cozy in there but there was way too much smoke in there.  maybe next time were in the hood we'll check out the lounge area and hang."

I asked for the meat sauce and the spaghetti sauce was spicy, I'm sure most kids don't want spicy food. The manager came and said yeah the sauce is kinda spicy so it was barely even eaten and I looked confuse because what restaurant feed kids spicy food. I told them to take the food cause my baby didn't want to eat it but I will still pay for it but they insisted that I don't have to pay for it. Then they came back rushing us out asking if we want a to go box, when we were still eating and drinking, how rude is that !! Our server was talking to her boyfriend a table just right in front of us and I have to try to get her attention every time we needed something. But the manager at that time was kind of pushing us to leave which was rude."

The cab driver mentioned Peppermill and since we have always heard great things decided to try it. Nothing was bad, but everything was just ordinary, except maybe the size of the plates. Peppermill burger was just ho hum, chicken fried steak and eggs - no different from anything else. The interior was cool, waitress was awesome.

Speaking of drinks, they have quite a few to choose from, lots of cocktails but unfortunately a rather poor beer selection, only Stella on tap, but they poor it well, so hard to complain. It's got two sides, diner with the full menu, then the \"lounge\" with the water/fire pit. I think your best bet is to go at the end of your night, when you're a little munchy, get a few appetizers and a nightcap then cab it home as the sun comes up."

By the time I get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. Thankfully, the Peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. It is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. It's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. Also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. She does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. \n\nI have ordered many entrees, both dinner and breakfast selections, some of which include the following:  Berry Spinach Salad, Crab Cakes, Omelettes, Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta, Swiss and Mushroom Burger, Creamy Chicken Dijon, Pesto Chicken Sandwich, Tomato Bisque, Chicken Noodle Soup. My favorite is the Creamy Chicken Dijon dinner. Two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the creamy dijon sauce.  It is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. I'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. The specialty drinks are excellent too. Cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the Fireside Lounge. I've ordered the Blue Hawaii a couple of times, and I have a friend that loves the Espresso Martini.\n\nAfter dinner, I usually get a couple of drinks in the Fireside Lounge. You get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. However, I have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines I've played at different locations in Vegas. You may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. All in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.\n\nI gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance."

It's great late night comfort food, especially when you've been drinking and partying all night...er.. when you DON'T have the kids, of course!\nOkay so my review is for May 2010 when we visited here. It was our first night in Las Vegas and a first time bringing a child and...me being 7 months pregnant (so no partying for me this time! I was craving steak and was VERY skeptical about ordering it at a place like this. I ordered the New York ! New York ! 27.95 (yes, the price is quite high) ***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: 12oz. hand-cut and trimmed, flame-broiled to perfection and served with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.*** Let me tell you that for someone that actually does NOT consider herself a red meat lover and eats it only on rare occassions (even though all my reviews seem to be centered on steak houses and burger joints LOL!), THIS WAS EXCELLANT EXCELLANT EXCELLANT! The kitchen staff really know their steaks! I thought there was a bone in it and kept eating around it...it was all cut with no bone! And being pregnant I had to order it more cooked than I would usually so I believe I got it Medium-Well...still amazing! Flavorful AND tender! So 5 stars there!\nOn another night (with our little one), we went just for dessert and ordered the Strawberry Shortcake 6.95\n***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: Moist slices of pound cake, a generous helping of strawberries and creamy French vanilla ice cream, all topped with real whipping cream.*** WHAT A TREAT! Fantastic! LOVED IT! We were all so tired and our little boy started getting cranky and fighting over bites and finally it ended up toppeling all over the table! Haha, it was a fun night. We love the Peppermill! ***Don't forget to wave to the kitchen staff on your way out. They REALLY appreciate that. :)\nFIRESIDE LOUNGE: When my man and I go to Las Vegas as adults, we LOVE the Fireside Lounge in all it's glowing ambiance! The drinks are fun, the hostesses are beautiful and elegant and they are always nice about taking our picture by the molten fire pit, hehe. The only thing I am sad about are the TV's they put in. They are  really distracting. If anyone knows the owners there, PLEASE tell them to take them out!"

So I said \"well I guess I'll sit over here since no one is going to clean this\" and sat in the empty space to my right.

Our taxi driver that took us there was crazy... i mean i think he smoked some crack before he was driving, but he was cool though.. he knew everything about the peppermill, and told me to get the fruit bowls.He said, \"It's the best fruit bowl you'll ever have in Las Vegas\" hahaha lol! Let me tell you... the fruit bowl was nasty. Don't order it.  Food was great, i love the stripper theme, that's always hot for a bunch of drunk people. The worst part about this place is that no taxi's will pick you up from here so beware... come here with caution if you're drunk!

Prices are reasonable comparing it to the portions you get. \n\nThe only downfall to this place which I feel doesn't take away from the rating is the long wait to get a table. Some suggestions are to call ahead, they are usually willing to put you on the list or hang out at the lounge and start out with cocktails. That's never a bad idea. \n\nWe came here for breakfast and the omelettes were huge. Probably made with 8-10 eggs and full with ingredients in every bite. \n\nWe will definitely comeback and bring lots of hungry friends."

There is a cocktail waitress who served good Bloody Mary's (heard the mimosas weren't that good).. and the food was large in portion but in my opinion.. not as good as Hash A Go Go.  Hash Browns were incredibly crispy and delicious.\n\nThe most amazing part is the fireside lounge where it's a round lounge around a fire that's on water.  It's truly amazing and reminds me of what a backroom of a strip club would look like if I were to go to those in Vegas (I haven't although I tried to once..

Remember when you would hit up Denny's and wreak havoc on their menus, staff and bathrooms? Well, when you're in Vegas, fuck Denny's. Peppermill is here.\n\nI don't know what kind of theme this place is going for. Everything about it screams cum stained strip club from the velvet seats to the neon ceiling lighting. I mean everytime I come here I seriously am anticipating fog to come out of one of the planters and up comes up Trixie the Tranny to start dancing. It's just reaaallly weird to be in this place but it's so exciting! Like I said, the place itself looks like a strip club, but the menus and the theme are completely different. I guess it's just bad marketing ideas for whatever they're trying to pull off.\n\nAside from the decor, the food is fantastic. Big plates of just pure American feast. And if you didn't know already, when you order their omelettes or anything with eggs, they use 10 eggs. Yeah. TEN. The hash browns are perfection. I highly doubt you'll ever finish your food, but if you do, you should enter yourself in an Eating Competition. And when you do finish your food, make sure there's a bathroom nearby that you can destroy. On top of all this, the staff is really nice! Kick ass staff and kick ass food in a kick ass strip club! Kick ass!"

Whether you're going for cocktails in the lounge or looking for a decent coffee shop in Vegas - you won't be disappointed. The giant omelettes are what the Peppermill are most famous for.

The cocktail waitresses wear these long, flowing black dresses and come into the restaurant from the lounge to take your drink orders. If you want to really get crazy with the drinks, order a Scorpion...it comes in a huge bowl with straws and is meant to be shared! You gotta see it to believe it! I shared one with my nephew and his wife and it was amazing. \n\nThe Fireside Lounge is a trip all by itself. It looks to me like something out of the 1970's: shag carpeting, and a main sunken seating area around a flaming fountain. There are video screens everywhere showing music videos.  I have come here numerous times on dates, with friends, after photo shoots, etc. Just kicked back and had a drink (or two or three) and ordered appetizers.

I dont think they make more creative and tasty omelettes.  Forget the IHOP, DENNY'S OR HOTEL OMELETTES! This place has out of the world, big and tasty omelttes.  My group had mediaterranean, veggie and this meat sauce one.  All tasty, good, blended well.\n\nFood here is tasty... and slightly pricy, but worth the while.  Great ambiance too!"

You can hang out in the sunken lounge if you want, that was kind of neat, and the drinks were good.  The dining area is a zoo, very busy.  That was my only critique; the waitress was so busy, our water glasses never got refilled.  The food was great and the portions were huge, think almost Hash House A-Go-Go big.  My omelet was the size of a football, and my buddy's pancakes were the size of a large plate.  Cocktail waitresses roam the floor as well, so drinks are available.  If you are on the north part of the strip, definitely stop by."

It is located by the Riviera & Circus Circus on the strip, so people are able to walk off their food afterwards because there is a lot of food coming your way!!!  \n\n1. Be prepared to wait-Giving any place in Vegas that is good and that does not have a reservation option, be prepared to wait.  There is not much seating areas up front so they will offer the lounge area to wait (highly recommended!) but usually everyone is waiting outside.\n\n2. There are large booths & typical bar seating-There is plenty of room to sit and the decor is straight up vegas style!  If I blinked twice I would have thought I was in a party bus with trees!  I loved the seating arrangement and everyone was in a good mood and can easily talk to the booth next to you!\n\n3. Waitresses were awesome (both times!) They let you know what is great on the menu and I did get everything in a timely manner...even though they were slammed!\n\n4. Food for Days- For the first round, I received the breakfast pancake platter and the size of everything is incredibly huge!  You pay around 13-14 dollars, but it is worth it (especially if your hotel room has a fridge, you will have leftovers!)  The second round I got the French Toast Ambrosia...this I highly recommend!! French Toast with a whole bunch of \"fresh\" fruit on top smothered in whipped cream (if you want) with blueberry sauce!!! YUUUMMM!\n\nThis place does not disappoint!! I cannot explain about how much I love this place and cannot wait to go back!"

The trashy specialty cocktails are humorous and I usually order one just to get in the Las Vegas spirit (I had the Bacardi O Dreamsicle last time). I recommend coming here for drinks and appetizers - the infamous fireside lounge is the coolest part of the building, if you can get a spot in there. It reminds me of something out of Fourside from the tripped-out Super Nintendo game Earthbound. You have to come here at least once as, from what I know, it is THE quintessential Las Vegas trash-diner... And it's open 24 hours! I hear there's quite the crowd at 4 AM ;)"

It was a little busy but nothing out of control and a few people waiting in the tiny \"lobby\".\n\nOnce we were seated it took AT LEAST 10min before our server WENDY came over to our table. How do you walk up to the customers who will be tipping you with sooo much attitude??! She asked what we wanted to drink, water and lemonade. We ordered the food while she was still standing there so we wouldn't have to wait again (which for some reason pissed her off to the point she felt the need to talk down to us). We told her what we wanted to her and she responded with, \"Yea, yea I got it..see I wrote it down. What else?\" Rude!\n\nThe lemonade never came out, so the bf waved down the next available sever. Our waitress came over within minutes to say, \"Soo..You ordered lemonade?\" We nod. She said, \"You ordered it from me?\". We nod again, and my bf told her she wrote it down. Instead of apologizing she rolls her eyes, walks away and someone else ended up bringing our drinks.\n\nI ordered the tostada omlet and the bf ordered the hamburger. It didn't take long for the food to get out, buuut I'm not sure why tables seated waay after us got thier food first?? (Maybe I'm being too picky??) \n\nThe food was just okay. Nothing I would ever come back or crave again. The hashbrowns were burnt on the outside and straight mush on the inside. Disgusting. I barely touched them. And OF COURSE she forgot to bring my side of toast.. whatever. I was already pissed off. Bf said his burger wasn't bad, but not worth the price. It came with fries but our shit server never gave us the option of onion rings, sweet potato fries etc. \n\nShe also thought it was okay to keep bending over so everyone could see her underwear up her skirt. Seriously?? GTFO. \n\nOverall..\nThis will have to be the last restaurant on earth for me to return. Shitty ass servers, boring food, poor management and waaay over priced for what you get.

Peppermill seemed to be the type of place I was looking for.  I was delighted to see free parking and their own parking lot and equally as delighted at the ridiculous decor inside! The menu is huge. My boyfriend had an omelet and I had a panini and fries and we were both stuffed. Glancing around it looked as tho all of the portions were just as big. Once we were done eating we ventured into the lounge and had a seat at the bar and eventually seats cleared out at the cozy fire pit which is surrounded by red rounded couches and lots of mirrors. We enjoyed big tropical drinks and people watched.  The Peppermill is the type of place where anything seems to go...exhausted travelers such as ourselves were welcomed during the week but an evening gown and tux would work just as well. IF you want some late night eats after a night out drinking in a really cool environment I would call this a must do."

I enjoyed the look of the place, and the lounge is small, but kind of cool.\n\nDon't know what all the 5 stars are for, perhaps for the look of the establishment, couldn't have been for the food.  The food was just okay.  I ordered eggs, sausage links and hash browns (they don't serve home fried potatoes - what a shame).  I was disappointed that the sausage links are turkey.  They also tasted like nasty.  My hash brown potatoes were cold.\n\nOur service was terrible.  Our waitress seemed to prefer spending more time at other tables than ours.  I never got that second cup of coffee I asked for during the meal, only when I asked for the check did she ask if I still wanted more coffee.  Really?  We also asked for extra napkins and condiments, and towards the very end of our meal they came.  \n\nOne last thing.  I ordered a Bloody Mary at the lounge while waiting to eat breakfast.  For the price, you'd think it would be fantastic.  Not.  Plain tomato juice and a splash of booze.  It tasted like I was drinking plain tomato juice.  I was very, very disappointed, sitting in those very, very uncomfortable chairs at the bar.\n\nMy overall opinion is to stay away from the place, as it serves up food just a notch below Denny's.  It's bloody Mary's are terrible.  Both the food and the drinks are overpriced for what you're receiving, especially compared to other restaurants.  The service was for me terrible, especially when noticing that how they treat you like shit, then dote on others around you.      If you're going to cook and serve food, at least cook and serve it the same for each customer.  Not specific ones.\n\nThey seem to pat themselves on the back for having a restaurant with a lounge that has survived there for awhile (just an observation from the menu).  All I have to say is people are idiots if they keep coming back.  Over priced food and drinks.  Underwhelming flavor.  Terrible service.  Trust me, you'd be better off at McDonald's."

I thought it would be in a casino, but from the outside it looks like an old Denny's complete with cheesy writing on the windows. But just ignore all the families waiting for a table as you bypass the restaurant and venture to the lounge for tropical drinks and shenanigans.\n\nThis is what a 70s pick up bar looks like in my dreams. Jack, Larry, Chrissy and Janet would love it! A dark jungle filled with couches and vines and touches of neon on the ceiling. Servers are lovely ladies in long black dresses slit to the hilt who join you on your lounge when taking your order. If you don't mind being part of the PDA show, sit on a loveseat in the firepit and become mesmerized by the bubbling electric blue liquid. Couples that want a little more privacy, should sit at one of the tables.\n\nThe majority of their cocktails are fruity tropical drinks and they pour heavy.  My early drinking days were filled with pina coladas and mai tais, but I've since transitioned to elegant cocktails. So it was like handing the reigns back to my early-20s self. I didn't have a care in the world here. They have a few beers, but nothing on tap. Prices are a bargain compared to other lounges on the Strip.\n\nI've got to admit that there are a few buzzkills to an otherwise ridiculously awesome Vegas experience. There are TVs everywhere and they play a continuous loop of bizarre music videos and performance pieces. For every bit of Vegas spectacle (Cher) there was something absolutely ridiculous (early Mandy Moore or really late Hall & Oats). About half of the acts couldn't even be identified. It was sort of like watching and listening to a slo-mo hair band audio car crash. The more significant issue was the continual interruption of the speaker announcing that tables were ready in the restaurant. \n\nBut if you can tune out those distractions, it is a swingingly good time. Mission accomplished!"

This place is a landmark and an excellent venue to escape the entertainment complex and enjoy a quality meal with a little 1960's charm. The female staff here are a bunch of old Vegas retiree dancers that wear tiny jumpers and shiny tights! (bow chica wow wow!) It's also got a kind of jungle decor to it, plus all kinds of shiny mirrors and neon lights - quite tacky. The food is great with enormous servings that can easily be shared between 2 and sometimes possibly 3 people. A good variety of breakfast choices 24/7. You'll definitely hit the food jackpot when eating here. Recommended to any Vegas visitor who want to enjoy a solid dining experience."

Highly recommend this restaurant.  Nice Vegas decor. Good for families.  Recommended by the locals as a place where they frequent."

            "review": "Huge portions. Decent food. After eating in their dining room one night, ordering take out the next night - I was told I couldn't order take out the following night b/c another customer ordered take out and didn't show up. That's like my business saying I had a customer who didn't pay an invoice once before, so I'm going to stop providing services to everybody now. You don't stay in business long with that mentality. \nAs a side note - both times I was in there - it was 90% empty."
