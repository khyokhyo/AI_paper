            "review": "We wanted to dine at other restaurants inside MGM, but they weren't open. Instead, we glanced at the menu, then decided on Emeril's. My friend & I shared the rib eye special and lobster bisque. The bisque was great, with lots of lobster taste, and some lobster chunks. The steak was aged 46 days, cooked medium rare, and served with saut\u00e9ed vegetables & mashed potatoes. The steak was super tender, and flavourful. The mashed potatoes were quite good, but the vegetables were meh. The service was also weird."

            "review": "A half empty restaurant on Friday night of Labor Day weekend should have tipped us off that this might not be a great experience. We have really enjoyed a few different Emeril restaurants in the past so we expected solid food. \nI was surprised after seeing their social media promotion of bourbon month that there were no featured cocktails or menu specials, other than the fresh sheet. But we ordered cocktails and a BBQ shrimp appetizer. I had to ask twice for the Pellegrino I had ordered instead of the tap water that was dropped at the table. Our cocktails took an incredibly long time. Did I mention the restaurant was half empty? Once they arrived they were really, really good. Bourbon smash and a peach tea - excellent drinks. Our shrimp came and we enjoyed it. The shrimp were smaller than I expected but tasty, and we really enjoyed the sauce. \nOur salad course arrived timely. The Caesar was described as having a Parmesan crisp, which was actually a thin slice of bread that was Parmesan crusted. It was incredibly hard and very difficult to break apart and enjoy in the salad. \nOur entrees arrived, again at a timely pace so that was good. My husband's shrimp boil was a massive plate of food. It was nicely flavored and was truly an overwhelming platter of shrimp. I did a fresh fish selection and it was perfectly fine, not awe-inspiring but it was alright. Once we were served our entrees neither of our two servers came back again. We had empty cocktails, and probably each would have enjoyed another has we been given the opportunity to order. \nWe finished eating, which when you are peeling shrimp actually takes quite awhile, and sat. And sat. And sat. There was a table of 8-10 in our section, and I would definitely cut some slack for that. However there were two people waiting on our table and one of them was virtually always just standing at the server station. One thing about Vegas is usually you get awesome service, and this was shockingly poor. I would have enjoyed being offered dessert, but after we sat and stared at our finished plates and empty glasses for so long we just needed to be done there. \nHaving really enjoyed restaurants in this group in the past it's tough to just write this one off. But between lackluster food and poor service it would be tough to give this one another shot."

            "review": "We had a corporate event here with open bar and ordering off the menu.  I can say all of us thought the food was very average and without any \"BAM\".  I could have gotten most of the menu items anywhere.  Service for our big group was poor.  The restaurant management assigned 2-3 servers for our big table which is not enough.  Took our table 30 minutes to get water, another 15 minutes to get wine, and another hour to get our food orders in.  It would have been OK except the food was all cool (no longer hot).  Menu is very limited and definitely not New Orleans style (and I have been to New Orleans).  There are better restaurants to go in the area.  The banana cream pie was pretty good."

The second one had tiled tables with a very casual atmosphere.  They told us that you would need reservations in order to be seated on the first section.\n\nPrice:\n\nAverage for a good fine dining restaurant.\n\nFood:\n\n- They give you three different types of complimentary bread which were not really my kind of taste.\n- The lobster bisque had amazing flavor and was the best I've tried so far.\n- Had Point Judith Calamari with salad for starters which tasted normal.\n- The color of the ribeye suggested it was cooked just right but the plating didn't look appealing and it reminded me that Fish Houses do not specialize in steaks.\n- Blue Crabmeat Stuffed Shrimp was amazing.\n- Pudding was good but nothing spectacular."

I asked the waitress first thing what items were dairy free and explained the situation to which she gave me a list of items and asked what my son, who is 2 likes to eat. She went back to the kitchen with the info I gave her and said they'd be happy to make a 4 oz filet of mahi and saut\u00e9ed asparagus for $12 with absolutely no dairy. She also put his order in right away so that we could get him set up before our food came out. Anyone with little ones knows how helpful that is. His food was delicious, he loved it! I had the \u00e9touff\u00e9e which was fantastic and my husband had the striped sea bass and loved it too. \n\nWe were delightfully surprised by both the great service and wonderful food!"

            "review": "Had dinner here last week to celebrate our last night in vegas. We came here before going to see Cirque show KA, so we had early reservations for 5 pm. The restaurant was not very full but the atmosphere was fun and the huge wine racks were fun to look at. \n\nI started with the green tea fizz cocktail and it was so light and refreshing, although it was a little bitter. Between the five of us we tried a lot of different things. I had the barbecue salmon and it was absolutely my favorite meal of the night. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was probably the best I've ever had. It paired great with the potatoes and sausage. The calamari was also top notch, you could tell his fresh it was because the finished product was so light and fluffy! The shrimp and grits meal was also good! The guys ordered the fishermans stew, they liked it but we're disappointed by the size. It wasn't worth the price so I would skip that meal. All in all it was a great experience!\n\nAnother notable factor, our waiter Rocco! He was outstanding and very personable!"

We did go in about an hour before closing, which usually means the staff is winding down and starting to prepare for closing. I ordered a whole fish entree-- it was delicious, but the bones were not easy to eat around. The bones usually stay in tact and you can pull them all out by the tailbone. No such luck. My fiance's seafood pasta dish was very bland. The seafood was fresh but the pasta sauce had no flavor at all. Great service, great wine, great chowder, but the whole fish entree was not easy to eat because the bones were too soft and just fell off the tailbone when i tried to remove it-- and I order whole fish from other places. The pasta dish was just not good."

Kick the chefs in the ass and promote the dessert guy because thanks to him the place got 2 stars instead of one.\n\nP.S. this place is not cheap.

Whoop-de-doo. \n\nBut his restaurants, on the other hand, actually showcase some of his cooking talents. I had a stomachache before coming here, so I was in no mood to eat a huge meal. I'm used to New Orleans gumbo (which is the best) and my mother's, so I'm spoiled, but this was definitely memorable. My date ordered the surf and turf, which was a filet mignon and crab dish with these great potatoes.

            "review": "My feelings are mixed.  Though I can be known to make a few snarky comments about  TV chefs, I have had 2 great meals at Emeril's restaurants in the past.  My expectations were probably tainted by an experience over 10 years ago at Emeril's in MGM.  Back then it had a much more fine dining vibe to it and the food was delicious.\n\nSo I was a little disappointed to arrive and find some of the staff dressed casually, the noise level loud and music more appropriate for their happy hour/bar area than for a dining room.\n\nFor the salad course, my guest sampled the \"Baby Romaine Hearts Caesar\" while I had the \"Seasonal Apple & Butter Lettuce Salad\".  The romaine was in no way \"baby\" as the sections of lettuce are served whole and reach from one end of the plate to the next.  The dressing was mediocre.  I did inquire about the seasonal aspect of the apples in my salad as it is June now in Vegas.  Please don't call something seasonal when it so clearly isn't.  I was surprised to get equal parts apple and lettuce.  The apple appeared to have been kept in water before being plated and not drained properly as the whole dish had an overall watery aspect to it.  This drowned out the dressing making it rather bland.\n\nFor starters I had the Judith Point Calamari which was quite good.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the peppers and olives served alongside.  Now might be a good time to warn other potential diners that aside from the atmosphere being too casual to be considered fine dining, the portion sizes are as well.  This isn't necessarily a problem, just something I like to be aware of.  At a nicer restaurant I often enjoy getting several courses to sample a variety of food.  The portions here are large and not designed for that.  I ended up leaving half of each course uneaten.\n\nMy main course was by far the best.  I had the Grilled Lobster with Chile and Lime.  Again, it was cooked perfectly and I liked the light flavor of chili with it.\n\nDessert was the famous Banana Cream Pie.  It was OK, but the \"cream\" part was not, in fact, creamy.  They had manipulated this element to allow the pie to be cut into huge, towering wedges that would hold a beautiful, upright shape.  This means texture and flavor were sacrificed for appearance by adding quite a lot of starch or some other thickening element that kept it from having the creamy, pudding texture I normally would associate with this.\n\nEach course was rather slow to come, but I am blame that on the kitchen, not the servers because each course was cleared promptly and water refills were plentiful.\n\nI probably would not be back.  If I am spending close to $300 for 2 people to dine I prefer a more refined setting where the food is more consistent.  However, the lobster was so good I might be tempted to order just that at the bar to satisfy any upcoming shellfish cravings."

Normally when I eat out there is always at least one dish that I don't really like but all of the ones we tried were spectacular, especially the perfectly prepared risotto (something that is really hard to find in the US) and the extremely tender, melt in your mouth beef tenderloin with a sauce to die for.  I'd recommend going for the prix fixe menu if you're hungry as all the selections were great and portions were very generous.  To top things off the bread and butter bread pudding was unbelievably creamy apple cinnamon deliciousness and the banana cream pie was light and fluffy but packing a rich banana cream flavor with a nice crunchy crust.

Man, Las Vegas has gone Manhattan.\nThe restaurant was very good overall. Sharply decorated and lit. The wait staff was very attentive and ready to get you anything. I had the seared ahi on top of endives and these white beans I forgot the name of. Very yummy. Oh yea, it was $34. My girlfriend had grilled white fish (I can't remember the name of it) with gnocchi. Very good as well. $36. They have smaller portions and I assume they assume you'll get a couple of appetizers. We only got a small salad to share. $10. Mojito $10. Glass of pinot grigio $7. Bill: $120 with tip. \nI would go back but I'll wait for when I hit big on roulette. I liked the hipster vibe there and appreciated the atmosphere which drew in a diverse crowd. \nThe wine list is actually a thick 60-page novel with quite a variety. \nGo here if you're looking for inventive dishes with excellent service. I did, however, find some of the menu options uninteresting. Half roasted chicken, casear salad. There were others that really didn't catch my eye. I was surprised since Emeril seems quite innovative. Speaking of Emeril, it seems that the restaurant just slapped his name on the place and ran with it. I really don't see what his influence is. There isn't much of a mention of him other than his trademark \"bam\" on the menu a couple of times."

It was very empty, but you would have thought they were slammed at how furious an 8 top table didn't have reservations. So then we get seated and our waiter asks for our drink orders. He was very irritated none of us ordered alcohol. A specific quote, \"8 adults and all I have is waters and 2 iced teas? Really people, start acting your age.\" It was not said in a joking tone and made several in the group very agitated. Then, he commented on the fact that we all ordered from the lunch menu and did not want any appetizers (\"You all are really watching the purse strings, huh?). We were so angry by the time our food came (did I mention it took forever??), we could not wait to leave. I would definitely never recommend it nor would I return."

They sat us quickly and kindly even though we didn't have a reservation. The service was impeccable and I would recommend the young man that waited on us have some type of promotion. I ordered from the preset menu because it seemed the best bang for your buck, and I was pretty darn hungry. The corn bread.. Amazing! Sounds bizarre, but that corn bread was to die for. For my first course, I ordered the clam chowder and no regrets there! By far the best clam chowder I have ever had, and I live on the coast. The scallops were beautiful, but unfortunately I could taste that they weren't fresh, but perhaps that's because I'm accustomed to having them fresh off the boat. They were also bland, which is to be expected from a scallop, however, the bed of beans and corn they laid it on did nothing to help the taste of the plate. That was the only let down of the evening, and it cost them a star. It's Emeril's restaurant, I expected better. The banana cream pie was rich, too rich for how full I was by that point! It was also very tasty. Huge thanks to our server for bringing out the bread pudding because he had overheard that I had never tried that dessert before. I loved it, a new favorite to be sure. Overall a positive, happy experience. I'll be back next time I stay at the MGM."

A big show is made out of the serving, bringing it in it's own little fancy pot to be then poured into your bowl. Interesting enough, but taste wise, hard to distinguish from canned clam chowder. It also tasted like the potatoes weren't quite cooked through.\n\nOur table had various sandwiches/burgers. I had a shrimp po'boy that was decent, the spices actually gave it a very nice new orleans kick.  It came with chips which I assumed would be homemade but instead was just given a bag of chips.  Seemed a little strange for a restaurant that is more towards the upscale side.\n\nI'm not a high-maintenance diner, however there were a number of service/execution issues here.  A couple burgers appeared to be undercooked, ordered as medium but instead borderline rare.  And we weren't offered refills or the check to settle up in a timely manner.  Our waiter seemed like a nice enough person, but unattentive.  Given that the lunch crowd was very light this day and it seemed the restaurant was fully staffed, it's harder for me to accept the poor service."

My wife and I shared a bowl of gumbo, sweet barbecued Scottish salmon, and pecan crusted Texas redfish. Every aspect of the service was absolutely outstanding. Shortly after we sat down, they brought us a small handout. Very tasty. Next came the gumbo. They were kind enough to split the gumbo in the kitchen. There was ample sausage, shrimp, and other goodies in the broth. It was good, but not great. The seafood restaurant in our local casino does an equally good job with their gumbo. I expected more from Emeril. The barbecue salmon had an andouille pork sausage and potato hash accompaniment. Delish!! The pecan crusted redfish came with pepper jack cheese grits and creole meuniere sauce. Yumm! Both fish dishes were terrific. So with excellent service and two main courses that were outstanding, why the 3 star rating? For me to give 4 or 5 stars, it has to be a restaurant that I want to return to soon. As a local, driving to the restaurant required parking at the MGM hotel. MGM has decided to add $15 to the cost of a meal at an MGM restaurant. Boy that pisses me off. I won't be going back soon. Hence 3 star review."

This was not out first choice but had enough people in it so it wasn't barren but still plenty of room.\n\nWe were seated and just kinda sat, I saw 2 servers keep looking at us while they were talking to others.  Finally one of the  2 came over for our drink orders.  Our friends after working, flying, dealing with airports/transportation and looking forward to a party were beyond ready.  So we sat finally our order was taken, after the order the drinks were delivered.  Shortly after the food was starting to be delivered.  This is when the problems started to occur.  The food was great like I said we only had a tasting of the menu.  \n\nKumamoto oyster, a small, sweet, briny, deep small shelled and a firmer textured oyster.  Probably the last shot for this one in the season, they were tasty!  Emeril's barbecued shrimp large prawn shrimp shelled and marinated in a zesty bbq sauce.  Good stuff we enjoyed it!  The Grand De Finale' Emril 3 Cheese Bacon Mac and Cheese need I say more?!  No. I didn't think so, but I will OMG I would come back drive to the strip and park and walk for this small piece of peace in the world it is the zen of mac and cheese I really had to hold myself back I could have easily gotten out of control.\n\nSo the food was great, the delivery of the food was great but the whole thing was just a huge mix match during the whole process that confused me.  As I said in the beginning 2 waiters were watching us as they took others orders.  The same 2 that tag teamed us all night.  1 would take a drink order the other would bring 1 but forget the other drink order.  The other would come check and ask about drinks and we would say we ordered but one was forgot?  The other would come back with the other drink.  You know what you drink and one of our friend drinks his drink on the rocks as soon as he got it he started to smack his lips and lick I said \"oh oh whats up?\" him \"it's not my drink but I will drink it\"  So basically the miscommunication and utter disarray screwed it up.\n\nNo biggie not the end of the world, but for such a well known Chef this is one place that is not doing his reputation well.  He needs to come in and check things out and get his staff back on track his food undeniably good but if it is not made to his standards, served properly in this town of amazing restaurants and top chefs you will fail."

The service when we were seated was good, ordered drinks.  Then waiters stayed on us to order.  After food was served they pretty much disappeared, weird.  Food was a disappointment, the gumbo was bland (surprisingly) and my shrimp and grits were very flat.  And food was lukewarm  maybe.  My boss had the ettoufee and he's a \"foody\" and he wasn't happy either.  Maybe this was an off nite but I won't go back.  Sorry!"

            "review": "After a night of drinking, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House was tossed out as a suggestion for lunch.  Six zombies and a baby wandered into a restaurant with grumbly tummies and a hunger for seafood.\n\nSweet Corn Bisque & Maine Lobster( $16), Pan Seared Fillet with hollandaise sauce and seafood risotto (forgot the price but it was a lunch special so it changes daily anyways), and Pecan Crusted Texas Redfish ($37).  I honestly wasn't feeling too well so I stuck with sharing just a few items.  \n\nThe Sweet Corn Bisque & Maine Lobster came out first.  It was everything I imagined it would be and it instantly made me feel loads better.  Sweet corn bisque that melds perfectly to delicious Maine lobster.  It had a couple chunks of asparagus and a cherry tomato.  The cherry tomato didn't offer much in terms to flavor to the soup so I'm thinking it was there for color and texture as were the asparagus.  It was smooth and creamy and was comfort in a bowl.\n\nMy main dish was the Pan Seared Fillet with hollandaise sauce on top of a seafood risotto.  After my disappointing ribeye at Aria, I was hoping this would hit the spot.  It did not.  The fillet was cooked perfectly but there was no seasoning and not even a nice char.  I pushed my plate away after eating a couple slices of the fillet and most of my risotto.  That was some really excellent risotto and the hollandaise was balanced beautifully.\n\nI also got to eat a good bit of the Pecan Crusted Texas Redfish (Anson Mills Pepperjack Cheese Grits, Garden Vegetable Ratatouille with Creole Meuniere Sauce).  The fish was amazing and flaky and those grits made my skirt flip.  While the garden vegetable ratatouille was fresh and flavorful, I could have done without this and had more cheese grits.  Hey, we're talking cheese grits here.  Can you blame a girl?\n\nService was excellent and everything was served with perfect timing and precision.  It's a beautiful restaurant and it wasn't too busy on a Saturday noon.  It's definitely worth taking a $10 Lyft from Bellagio to MGM for!"

            "review": "Emeril's style of cheffery is considered by many young chefs these days to be lazy and outdated. Though he probably was, at some point, an inspiration to most of them (they'll never admit it), his generation's approach to food and cooking seems to be a dying artform.\n\nBut there's something refreshing to his laissez faire, rustic kind of cooking. It's less scientific and more \"feel\". Less sous vide and more pan roasted. This is what I was looking for when I dined here.\n\nUnfortunately, the experience mostly seemed hackneyed and lazy. \n\nThe server was...well...weird. I couldn't quite read him. Maybe he was new. Either way, he did a satisfactory job and was at least friendly. \n\nWe started with the chilled seafood platter. I was excited because the menu said the shrimp and lobster was \"creole boiled\" and that there was king crab remoulade. And though, the shrimp and lobster were fresh and delicious, the were certainly no creole spices to be found anywhere. Not to sound like an elitist, but I lived in Louisiana for 8 years and have eaten lots of creole boiled whatnot and there was no spice at all in this seafood...and barely any flavor. (Ok, I guess I'm an elitist...sue me!)\n\nSecond course we received the gumbo and the barbequed shrimp. The former was rich and smokey, full of flavor and decidedly lukewarm. The other complaint about the gumbo is the homemade andouille: super garlicky...overwhelmingly so and whatever spices were in there weren't ground up enough because I was crunching on some stuff every other bite. The shrimp were superb. This is a classic Emeril dish that always delivers. I will say I would prefer a crustier, sturdier type of bread to serve with the dish. The rosemary biscuits, while fantastic, crumble when trying to dip into that beautifully rich and flavorful sauce.\n\nFor the main course, we split the grilled salmon with barbeque sauce, frizzled onions and brabant potato hash with tomatoes and andouille. Fresh fish, perfectly cooked to medium, yet a bit overwhelming. Lots of flavor doesn't always translate to balanced flavor. There was a lot going on in this dish and again, the homemade andouille just kind of overpowered my palate (not to mention my GI tract. I think I burped garlic for about a week).\n\nThe dessert was decent. We ordered the trio with bread pudding, banana cream pie and chocolatey something-or-other. The chocolatey-something-or-other was (obviously) not memorable. The banana cream pie was UBER rich but tasted good. The bread pudding was definitely the best part. \n\nMore is not always better. There was definitely a little too much BAM! and not enough thought put into these dishes. This seemed more like the cuisine of an upscale Claim Jumper than of a world class chef."

The person cooking your food was probably working at Popeye's last week. I ordered the gumbo but the portion was appetizer sized and the shrimp (not shrimps) was overcooked. On the positive side, it was very lively and looked out onto the hustle-bustle of the casino. I will not go back... not because it was bad, but because I can do better in a foodie town."

We shared the gumbo and the jambalaya (since almost everyone else in the restaurant was eating this). Both were very good, but tasted kind of similar. They also came out almost immediately so maybe there is a large pot in the back. It honestly worked out very well for us since we were on a time crunch. I would recommend getting the gumbo over the jambalaya since it is about half the price and almost the same thing (the gumbo is more of a soup poured over a bed of rice while the jambalaya was like a paella)."

            "review": "what a great meal!  first, every person who helped us--every person-- was a pro.  From the hostesses to the bus person to the two waiters--everyone was knowledgeable, eager to discuss, and friendly.  Our waiters--Christian and Dan--answered every question with amazing detail, whether the subject was food or wine.  I'm a foodie--and a former waiter--and I'm so often dismayed at the disinterest servers exhibit when I ask about the food.  Well, at Emeril's Fish House in LV, I never felt as though I was asking for too much detail (even tho i do ask for a crazy amount of detail, I admit).  Everyone was knowledgeable and very, very friendly.  \nOn to the food.  The oyster app was delicious.  Mind you--I have said on many occasions that I plan on dying before eating an oyster.  Dan or Christian convinced me to try it.  Despite my not feeling at all suicidal, this evening, I did try it.  Well, all I can say is, if this is your last meal, order the oysters.  lol.  O.k., suicide jokes (always a crowd fave) aside, the oyster app was very, very good.  Allow me to get a bit foodie-wonky for a moment.  First, it's very, very good. Order it.  The only complaint I have is that the oyster flavor was overpowered by the mushroom, bacon and panko crust--which were all extremely deelish.  Alas, the poor, introverted-in-flavor oyster part of the dish was practically eliminated. So, I'd recommend that this \"proportion\" issue be addressed.  The oyster sort of freshens this very, very excellent dish.  \nOn to the bbq shrimp.  The bbq shrimp app was really wonderful--bbq'd yet creamy, with a rosemary biscuit that was crunchy and absolutely PIPING HOT.  So good.  This is a signature dish and you should order it, as well.  \nThe bbq salmon was perfectly medium rare and the onion rings served with it were super crispy and just salty enough to so wonderfully accent the sweet bbq'd salmon.  Yum.  The mushroom and foix gras side I ordered was simple but wonderful.  \nI ordered the New Orleans dessert sampler.  The southern pecan pie tart with vanilla ice cream was totally over-the-top amazing.  It's hard to recall the others on the sampler dish because this was so good.  Who makes crusts out of corn meal?!?!?!?  I do--from now on. Corn meal and butter--what could be bad?  But I digress.  Where was I?   Ah, the other desserts.  So, Emeril's banana cream pie.  It's famous.  OK, it was a great dessert.  A little too heavy for my taste (the filling was very, very rich-- a bit too rich, imho)--but it was a great dessert in its own right--but not next to the pecan pie.  The bread pudding was very good, as well--particularly because it was unusually creamy and light and not too sweet--but again, imho, it paled in comparison to the pecan pie tartlet. \nOverall, this is a great restaurant.  If you're a foodie, go here.  This is what it's all about."

There really wasn't a whole lot of Butter Lettuce in the salad, but it did have an abundance of matchstick sliced Fuji Apples :) The salad was tossed with honey glazed almonds, celery leaves and shaved manchego cheese and dressed in a super light, citrusy, sweet and slightly sour dressing. I'm not a huge fan of celery, but the mild taste from the leaves was a nice refreshing accent. \n\nFor my main course I had the the Pan Roasted Flounder. It was a little...confusing? The fish was cooked perfectly, tender and flaky with a nice light \"crust\" from the sear. The part that I didn't love about the dish was the corn grits, it was a little too...gritty. It may have been the corn, but it felt a bit grainy when I was eating it. The Maine Lobster sauce that dressed the dish complemented it nicely.

A tad salty as you would expect from such a savory dish, but I would totally have it again.

We finally made it and they sat us in the worst possible seats... the area was also known as the 2nd kitchen, where they prepare everything before they serve each table. My food was actually REALLY good from what I remember. It was like a pecan crusted fish dish and crab bisque. Delish. I got super full too fast so I couldn't enjoy it as I wanted to.

We came here so often we had our favorite waiter that always took great care of us.\n\nFlash forward to even happier times. Happily divorced that is. I have family staying at The Signature condos connected by a looong walkway to the MGM where Emerils has been for 15(?) years. It's Super Bowl weekend and I figured most decent places would be maxed out. I called and successfully made rezeez for 5 about 10 days out. \n\nThe place has seen a remodel since I last visited and looks great. We were enthusiastically greeted and promptly seated exactly at our appointed time. My niece saw Stone Crab Claws and launched into an orgasmic squeal. \"OMG, I have to get those!\"  I replied, \"yeah we'll have to get one of those for the table.\"  She shot daggers my way...\"oh no way, I want an order to myself.\" Alrighty then.\n\nYep, you guessed it. Out of Stone Crab Claws. That'll teach her for been so greedy eh? So the meal didn't get off to the best start ever. We did order possibly the best ceviche I have ever had, and soon the claws that were not to be were soon forgotten. This ceviche made up of rock shrimp, fresh white fish, sliced avocados, and a generous helping of sliced jalapenos was a divine start to the meal.\n\nBonus pause: I spyed a great value for our wine: Dry Creek 08 Zin, $44. Deal. The wine list is extensive and there are more great buys to be found.\n\nThe food? Well I was that guy. The guy that ordered the worst choice of the table. I know this is a seafood place, but I was drawn to the braised pork shank. The red beans and mustard greens lent a nice southern authenticity to the meal, but most of the shank was just too dry. It was also lacking seasoning. Just kinda boring, until you got close to the massive bone. The meat nearest the bone was the definite payoff. Succulent and most satisfying, but one had to really work for the money shot. At $32 not a rip off by any means given the portion size, but I wish I  would have started at the bone and worked outwardly. Now you know.\n\nMy nephews filet was the envy of the night. Perfectly seasoned and oh so tender. Right up there with the best steak houses, although not a huge portion, but more than enough to satiate all but the most gluttonous diners.\n\nOur sever seemed to be a novice, but the ultra pro floor manager regaled us with amusing asides and some anecdotes of Emerils history. The gent knows how to work the room.\n\nIf staying on this end of the strip, this is a great option. It is semi-high end, but not outrageously so for current Vegas standards. It is a very relaxing room where you'll never feel rushed. A definite departure for most of Vegas."

With that being said everything I ordered was extremely salty.   I normally eat very salty, but this was too salty for me.

Last time I came here they were closed, so this time around I figured I'd be judicious and make a reservation with it being New Years and all. I didn't want to strike out again, so we nabbed a spot through Open Table. \n\nMy boyfriend was pretty psyched to try Emeril's Fish House. He believes New Orleans and Las Vegas (and NY) are among the top culinary capitals in the world - so we'd be getting a two-fer here!! We were a little surprised when we arrived and Emeril's wasn't flooded with people - we were expecting scores of people on New Years Eve. I guess many folks were jostling with the millions out on the LV Strip for the imminent countdown. \n\nService was fantastic! We were waited on by a trio of attentive, personable staff members that really made us feel so welcome and relaxed.\n\nWe started with the Chicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo and the Iceberg Wedge Salad. Great gumbo loaded with chicken, andouille sausage and vegetables in a strong-flavored broth.  We also ordered a few fine cocktails. I had the Expresso Martini to ensure I would be wide awake after all the dinner inhalation, er, I mean consumption, into 2012! My martini was smooth, aromatic with strong currents of Kahlua and expresso. \n\nFor our main courses, I had the BBQ Salmon with Andouille Sausage and Potato Hash, all topped with onion crisps. It was absolutely delicious! My big juicy salmon fillet was perfectly cooked with a nice slightly raw center.  It was classy with a little bit of sassy! I will definitely be partaking in this succulent salmon next time I come in. My boyfriend ordered the Seafood \u00c9touff\u00e9e. I don't know it is was his lofty expectations or his picky palette, but he wasn't blown away. I was hoping he'd be overcome with joy but such was not the case. He said it was good but he will try another selection next time. \n\nEmeril's Fish House is a wonderful place to come dine, with fresh salivating seafood and steaks, exceptional service, impressive wine list, decadent cocktails and beautiful decor. Come in and experience New Orleans inspired creations with creative Emeril Lagasse spin."

But the closest place he had was in LV. I just happened to be there in a month so I thought it would be a great idea to try his food as a special dinner for me and my bf because we only had one night in Vegas. \n\nWe ordered Crab Cake for appetizer. The cake itself was a bit salty for my taste but it was good. But I don't know why they put their deep-fried(almost burned taste), over-seasoned bread aside which came with the cake. I think it's too salty and too hard to go with the cake. When I bit off, it crumbled and fell on my skirt:(\n\nFor our entre, we ordered Mahi Mahi, which came surprisingly unseasoned comparing to the crab cake. It came on the top of mashed potato with no gravy or no taste what so ever... So I suppose I eat nearly unseasoned Mahi Mahi with unseasoned mashed potato...? I've never tasted anything like this before and I did not like it. The fish was too dry for my taste anyway.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered his famous banana pie. ...It wasn't bad but it wasn't extraordinary either. I've had much better ones before.\nOther than that, their customer service was very nice and professional. I loved their bread too.\n\nMaybe we didn't order the right meals. Maybe we are from different country with different taste. But I can tell you it did not worth the money I paid."

The service was fabulous and the waiters were well spoken, as well as generous (more on that later).\n\nThe four course RW meal had many choices. To begin with though we were brought a superb bottle of Riesling. I'm so sorry I missed what the name of it was! After our wine we were brought a bread plate that was full of tasty breads - most importantly, the pretzel bread! It was soft, warm, and had that salty pretzel taste.\n\nFor my meal I started off with the jalapeno cornbread heirloom tomato salad. It was incredibly filling. I would not suggest this for a starter when you are going to have more to eat! Although it was delicious, I was wishing for a bit more jalapeno kick.\n\nNext I had the Fall River Clam Chowder. All of our soups were poured simultaneously from the pots they were cooked in, into our bowls. I think the presentation adds a fun moment to the dining experience. As for the chowder, it was okay, but nothing amazing. I've had better chowder from a street vendor in San Francisco.\n\nFor the main course I opted for the Hoison glazed sea scallops and baby back ribs. I was slightly disappointed. When the first part of the meal says \"Sea Scallops\" I expected more of those and less of baby back ribs. But it was completely opposite. On the good side, the scallops were so good. Not chewy. They just melted in your mouth and they were BIG. I wish I had had more. I really only had a few bites of the ribs. I didn't think they were that great.\n\nLastly I had the banana cream pie. It is an absolute must. It was delightful. Somewhat fluffy, yet decadent at the same time. \n\nWe finished off two complimentary bottles of wine during the course of dining. Hmm, yes, well it helps to know people in the business. ;)\n\nOverall I can't give Emeril's 5 stars, but I am certainly a fan. I would love to return for more seafood on another visit."

Classy but not too stuffy. Waiter was awesome and even made some great recommendations. We had the frog legs ($15)as a appetizer. They were amazing! A must try! For the entrees we had the pork chop ($30) and the salmon ($34)with a side of mushrooms ($10). Portions were big and we left full. Definitely worth the higher price point. Overall we were impressed and surprised."

(Even though i can't finish the bowl, i don't care!) I always get the bowl!! (It goes great with the hot round bread) My bf loves the steak here. More than Del Monico(i know they are both owned by Emeril)!! When he orders a rare steak, unlike some places, they bring it out rare. He dislikes greens but when he gets steak from this place, everything on the plate disappears!! The wine selections are also great. We are no wine experts, so we ask the waiter or waitress what they might like to recommend. They bring out something that we might like, to figure out if we like it or not, and then brings out something that we will both love!! I can't wait to go to veags again!! I love Emeril's!! BAAAAM!!!"

To start, we had the \"fondue\" and soup special of the day. Fondue is a misnomer for this dish. It was more like crackers with an avocado relish and a cheese dip. But it was completely delicious; I scarfed down every last crumb.\n\nFor the main dish, I ordered the mixed seafood dish and my boyfriend got the steak sandwich. The seafood dish was almost like a paella -- fish mixed with shrimp and clams and mussels in a risotto-like rice. Thankfully, the flavors weren't overwhelmingly fishy. The steak sandwich is served cold with a warm au jus accompaniment. It was good but so are the sandwiches you get at the corner deli.\n\nWe ended our meal with the banana cream pie. When we ate at the Emeril's in New Orleans several years ago, the pie stood out in my mind so I had to order it again to see if it deserved the pedestal I had placed it on. It did. It was a massive piece of pie with a ton of fresh bananas. THE BEST banana cream pie I have ever had. \n\nIf you're willing to drop some dough on a meal, this is a good option.

The wines offered in the wine list are quite expensive, not many cheap options. Majority of the wines (per bottle) had a price tag of $150+.\n\nThe food had quite a good taste, very well seasoned and very rich in flavor. I had the Rib Eye which had great taste with a side of lobster tail which was quite small, seemed like a big shrimp for the price of $36 for just that.\n\nThe tab ended out at $1200 which averages about $100 per person which seems quite expensive when two of us shared meals with other people, we did have two $52 wine bottles but still i think it was quite expensive when there were just 5 appetizers ordered and 10 meals. The wait for the food was quite long as well id say we waited 45 mins for our food to arrive.\n\nGiving it a 3 because food was good, but the price, the wait, and the choices weren't too good."

The waitstaff and hostesses were super, super nice.  The lighting was nice and we definitely enjoyed being there and the conversation.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was kinda meh.  I got a shrimp po boy, and honestly, the one I got at the little dive bar right by the hotel in NOLA was WAY WAY better and about 1/3 the price.  Joel got fish tacos - and while what he got was tasty - it could barely be called a taco - it was more like a fish quesadilla without any cheese.  It wasn't *bad* at all.  It just didn't blow me away as I expected.\n\nI definitely want to give the one in NOLA a chance, but with so many other places in Vegas to eat, I don't think I'll be getting back here any time soon."

I loved the lively atmosphere of the space but, in the end, I wasn't won over by either the service or the food. I guess I expected a lot more \"BAM!\" from this James Beard award-winner celebrity chef but, instead, every dish out of the kitchen was fairly bland & unmemorable: from the gumbo, chowder, fish & meat dishes to the desserts (I got to try a little of everyone's dish).

Had a couple of HH drinks, their mojito and margarita. Good stuff.\n\nGot a couple of raw oysters. Not sure what I was thinking--should have ordered more. Very tasty.\n\nGot the fried oysters also. What in the world? These guys were mutant sized, like the size of my hand and almost an inch thick in some places. So good though! Get this!\n\nAlso got the HH crab cakes. Not too impressed. Don't bother with this. I think it was the blue crab cakes. Tiny. Decent taste, obviously not lump crab so stick with the oysters.\n\nDidn't have room or time for anything else. I had dinner to go to like in an hour. Vegas baby."

We had 3 kinds of wine and different mixed drinks. All came out quickly and tasted great. 3 of our party had the tasting menu. (I can't recall if it was 4 or 5 courses) Timing was great. Complimentary bread, salads and appetizers rolled out right on time and entrees directly after.(pretzel rolls were my favorite!)  We didn't have to rush thru anything to get to our entrees or wait for our entree. It was impeccable timing! Mushroom toast and bbq shrimp were both great. We had Caesar and apple salads with crunchy sweet toasted nuts..everything was so delicious we were all just passing around and sampling off each others plates. I had the fisherman's stew...DELISH! Light, fragrant broth, perfectly cooked shrimp and shellfish and flaky fish! We had 3 ribeyes, all cooked differently and all to perfection!  This is rare! The pork chop was charred on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. The butterfish was perfection! We sent an additional tip back to the cooks to show our appreciation and how thrilled we were with everything!   Entire time our waitress was attentive and on top of things but never bothersome... Then came desserts (yum) I believe we tried everything they had except the beignets. My favorite was the bread pudding by far! I will be recommending this place to anyone who makes makes the trip to Vegas for sure and I know my family will as well! Great job to the whole staff and Emeril Emeril and mgm! This is an outstanding restaurant!"

This time we ventured off our own hotel property to dine at Emeril's here at The MGM. We had a reservation for 500pm & were stuck in traffic on the strip and had to call and push back; not a problem; the staff was more than accommodating. If your coming from somewhere else, I highly recommend valet'ing your car; it's too far to walk from self parking and confusing. The MGM is also always packed and so large, it's a little hard to navigate. We arrived for dinner and were seated promptly. Again, I don't recommend not having a reservation. You can get a reservation from Open Table via the Yelp app; makes it super easy! We started by telling the waiter that someone in our party had less than an hour for dinner; the waiter suggested ordering quickly and was accommodating to his needs. The rest of us wanted to relish our dinner and enjoy the experience. We started with frog legs ( off the current prix fixe menu and priced separately) and andouille sausage gumbo. Loved the frog legs with house made ranch for dipping. You get 5 nice sized legs; fried just right and good to share. The gumbo was a bit salty, in my opinion; maybe because I was taught in the dirty south by a southern mama how to make it just right?! My water glass and lemon never went empty; just out of surgery this was a dry trip to Las Vegas. My fellow diners, however, had Cosmo Martinis and a southern beer called, TurboDog. Impressive wine list to couple the display of wines encased. I wish :) My next course was the filet and broccolini. It was cooked to perfection and spice rubbed with a blend of Emeril's pepper and various other Cajun type spices. There was a wine and mushroom reduction that went well with the meat and the smashers I ordered on the side; yummy mashed Yukon gold potatoes that easily served 3-4! My dining mates had the fish pan roast and crab cake; both were amazing ! The crab cake off the appetizer menu is very generous and not at all , typical . It was loaded with nice, fresh lump crab. Yummy. My boyfriend ordered the cornbread , which is literally a pan full! Afterwards, 3 of us split the $10 banana cream pie ; as if we were not full enough! It was a good 4 inches tall and so rich and delicious. The Fiori espresso is perfect to end with ... I was impressed by the staff and food ; the decor is getting dated for a place and Chef so amazing ; it's very late 90's and the dining music was very 'disco' ; if it's supposed to be a fine dining experience with the price tag to match ... Change up the music to match the class :)"

Our waiter was almost rude and didn't give very good recommendations when it came to the wine. He would also come and clear our plates while people would be in mid conversation - just butting in rather than waiting for the person to finish like most well trained waiters at nice establishments should and do. The food more than made up for this though. Although the menu is indeed not very extensive, I thought everything we tried was delicious. I came here with a fairly large group and since none of us could make a decision about what we wanted to order, we decided to just order a bunch of things and share them. This isn't really a \"family style\" type of place but it worked out just fine for all of us.... although the waiter was rude about it, huffing under his breath \"that won't be enough food\". He clearly wanted each of us to order three courses and drop more money. He was also visibily irritated when we didn't order multiple bottles of wine. Anyway, back to the food: for appetizers we ordered the braised short rib beef ravioli which was awesome. It came on top of a bed of celery root puree which had a really great flavor. We also got the fried calamari with pepperoncini, tomato and cucumber salad that had a really great spicy kick to it, and also the salad the of the day which had blue crabmeat, apple, and candied pecans which was also wonderful and light. For entrees we got the monkfish which was on the specials list which was delicious and buttery, the ribeye which was cooked perfectly and the chicken that was also delicious and flavorful and juicy. We got a side of jambalaya which was amazing and also the bourbon sweet potato puree which was amazingly rich. The desserts were what really made this meal though. We got a special white chocolate bread pudding which was really one of the best desserts I've ever had, along with an impressive cheesecake and a caramel pecan torte."

The interior was festive but collected and calm at the same time. Very tastefully done. \n\nWe went there specifically for the tasting menu, which my boyfriend had had before and loved. It was the most impressive meal I've had, not just because of the food but because we were served by a TEAM. There was the bread guy, the busser guy, the wine guy, and the main server. They could not have been more polite, attentive, or friendly. \n\nthinking we were jsut getting \"tastes\" of wine parings for each dish, we started out with a bottle of white but we sure didn't need it - each pairing was a full glass of the most perfect wine. The \"wine guy\" (our own personal sommolier) gave a description of each after pouring, and the only complaint was that he was soft spoken so we had a hard time hearing him. They were all probably a bunch of adjectives anyway, we're not wine snobs so we didn't care too much. I had to try real hard not to till up with each dish, knowing there was more to come - 8 dishes in all. God, it was SOOOOO good. After that i was so full of wine and stuffed with incredible food i just went back to our hotel and zonked out! ;-P\n\nFor anyone looking for a memorable dining experience, there's lots of celebrity chef restaurants out there but this one was really worth it.

(and I've never been disappointed)"

The staff is incredibly friendly, which is probably why I ordered everything that our server suggested.  I'll admit it.  I overdid it.  Now if you do not like to spend a good amount of money, this is not for you.  My stomach doesn't mind.  The salmon was so delicious, as was the crawfish etouffee!  But that sweet corn bisque and Maine lobster--I nearly fainted at the first taste!  The homemade fruit sorbet sealed the deal.  I was done.  I have no idea how I made it back to the hotel.  Thank you for another amazing dinner!"

While I don't find the food amazing at Emeril's, it's at least reasonable (although known for being too heavy handed with the salt shaker) and one of the best choices usually for lunch at MGM.... until last week.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were sitting at my usual spot at the bar.... it was only about 3/4 full having a bowl of clam chowder & wedge salad.... Not bad, but very, very average.  Our waiter was flirting with a customer at the bar about 5 people down from me.  He would go between the customer & his co-worker behind the bar, chuckling laughing & ignoring EVERYONE else at the bar.  Myself, my girlfriend and 2 other restaurant guests were trying to get his attention (he was 3 -10 feet away at all times) for 8-10 minutes, but despite all of us calling for him, he deliberately ignored all of us and kept talking to his co-worker, until we all collectively started yelling for his attention.  His co-worker turned to us and became very aggressive and told us they were busy.... Apparently he didn't realize we were actually there watching them not work, just joke with each other.\n\nI informed the manager and he said he would talk with him..... he walked over to him and gave him of those \"pretend I'm upset with you\" kind of speeches.  After the manager spoke with them, all we received were intimidating stares from the two behind the bar, with no remorse for their behavior... or even apologies for a misunderstanding, if there had been one.\n\nIn the end it showed that the service and the management at Emeril's have no passion or care for their food, their clients or their restaurant.... and in the city of Las Vegas there are many many other choices that will always be better.  I told 12 of my professional associates and I know the others that were subject to the behavior told others too.  None of us will ever return."

Each course was served with a glass of wine that was perfectly paired with the food we were enjoying.

Despite reading a bunch of Yelp reviews I was hoping our experience would somehow be different than the majority. It wasn't. \n\nLet's start on a good note: service was a bit overbearing, but otherwise great. (4/5 stars)\n\nEntrees: WOW I can't believe how freaking awful these were. At the price point they were (which btw, the prices have gone up compared to what they are on the website!!) they really should have been much better. \nSea bass with lobster ($42): How can you go wrong? Well somehow Emeril went very wrong on this pricey dish. First impression, the plate is VERY white with just a little bit of puke green. Imagine a white mushy flavorless \"potato cake\" swimming in a small sea of nasty pukeish green \"chile sauce\" topped with a tiny 4 oz piece of white sea bass and a tiny 2 oz piece of rubbery lobster. White mushy fish on white mushy potatoes? What idiot thought that pairing would work?? The components didn't work, the dish was executed poorly. Honestly no redeeming qualities to this hella expensive $42 dish. \nAhi Tuna special (off menu so not sure of the price): Yes the tuna was damn good, but it was swimming in a sea of TOMATO SAUCE with sausage ravioli? Seriously are the chefs here on crack? Red tuna + acidic red tomatoes = no bueno. \n\nSorry philosophically I think a well thought out entree should represent BALANCE. Red tuna + red sauce? White fish + white potatoes ? Aesthetically, and on a texture basis these dishes were epic fails. They tasted \"ok\", but at $40++ a plate it should taste way more than ok. \n\nAlright so now you're wondering why 3 stars instead of 1 or 2?? The desserts were f-ing AMAZING. Please follow the advice of me and several other yelpers and only come here for dessert. The beignets, bread pudding and banana cream pie were all spectacular. Emeril really does have the best banana cream pie in the entire world and it's worth a trip to the bar here to have a slice for yourself!"

My bf's family and I ordered too many appetizers so by the time we were done with that, I was completely stuffed. We started off with the clam chowder (with applewood bacon) and gumbo (spicy with rice, sausage, shrimp). Both the soups came in a tiny pot and was poured into a bowl in front of us by the waiter. Cool presentation :) The bacon wrapped scallops were amazing! I've never had scallops that HUGE before. Crabcakes were also really good with the apple slaw garnished on top. Mac n cheese was also good, but the cornbread was pretty mediocre. I also ordered a cocktail --New Orlean's Nectar which was very good. For the main course, I had the BBQ salmon. I wanted it cooked medium which was the perfect texture, but I was so full from appetizers that I couldn't enjoy the salmon that much.  I also tried my bf's lobster risotto which was a little bit too creamy and heavy for my liking, but they definitely did not skimp on the lobster. Meat lovers should definitely try their ribeye that came on the wood it was cooked on. For dessert, we had the tiramisu and banana creme pie. I am not usually a big pie fan, but the banana creme pie with fresh bananas was probably the pie i've had. The tiramisu was not good (compared to Shibuya's which I had the night before), so no need to try that. The meal came about to be $300 for a party of 4, so not bad-- worth a try."

My Dad's jambalaya was cold, my Mother's fish was undercooked and rubbery, not to mention they did not put her sauce on the side. The chicken that came with my salad was charred and dry. When the drinks finally arrived they were watered down. My bourbon smash was some odd colored mix of mint and lime juice. The quality of service, and food/drinks was absolutely unacceptable for the price. We'd have done much better if we had just eaten at the food court."

So I can't really compare. \n\nMade a reservation thru Open Table for 5pm on a Saturday, we were seated right away, as they had just opened. The ambiance is nice, loved the wine bottles displayed in the middle of the restaurant. Our server immediately came over and introduced himself and took our drink orders. \n\nMy eyes lit up when I saw the bread basket had pretzel bread in it, Joe's Stone Crab is my other spot that I usually fill up on their pretzel bread. Who knew this would be the highlight of my meal, actually my glass Sauvignon Blanc was a highlight. Anywho, this is what I ordered:\n\nCold Salmon Tartare-this was good, served with flat bread. Good flavor.\n\nHorseradish blue shrimp with cous cous-this was a huge let down. The dish had no hint of horseradish at all, it was more of a BBQ taste than anything else. I believe it was Isreali cous cous, so they are a bit larger and have a slightly different texture than regular cous cous. \n\nBanana Cream Pie-I can't really judge this as I guess I'm not a fan of banana cream pie, my guess is if this is your thing, it was probably delicious. I was trying to be different and order something I wouldn't normally order.\n\nI don't see myself ever coming back here or recommending to anyone to try, even if it's RW."

Emeril's menu seemed to have us covered, and during their happy hour (bar-only), it seemed fortuitous.  \n\nWe ate half a dozen oysters at their happy-hour prices, which were a good start.  The prie fixe menu - soup, salad, entree and dessert seemed like a good deal, as well.\n\nThe duck confit salad was surprisingly luxurious.  The clam chowder was sufficiently clammy and salty.  The entree of Sweet Barbecue Glazed Salmon was plentiful and filling, while also being more sweet than anything.  \n\nMy friend's entree of what looked to be Scallops in Spaghetti looked down right sad.  Barely a tiny bowl's worth of food, and it honestly looked like it came from a can.  Yes, spaghetti from a can, with tiny scallops added to it.  \n\nDessert came and went, the Bread Pudding being extremely buttery.\n\nThe service was courteous when they came by at the bar, but otherwise, they were really more interested in whatever else they were doing - maybe setting up for the rest of the night, filling table orders.\n\nAll in all - did I feel like my dinner was worth the $63?  Yes, it's a fair value for the strip.  My friends?  Not even close.\n\nI miss Seablue."

Lets just say it was very interesting to watch what people were wearing.. daisy dukes in a restaurant, please..  \n\nWe also had dessert, the brownie was light and fluffy, the walnut chocolate chip oatmeal cookie was very good but the best part was the cookies and cream ice cream that came with it. The coffee was also amazing.. \n\nThe service was good, they were very attentive, they better have been since we were a party of 6, they automatically added at 18% tip. \n\nI would say dinner for 2 for under $200 is a bit pricey but for a special occasion, well worth it.. \n\nNext time we just go for dessert.."

It just didnt have flare.\n2) Clam Chowder - good but tasted like any other place that serves chowder with bacon.  Find some clams with LESS SAND.\n3) I had a Special of the day Fish with Prawns (forgot what it was called).  The fish was cooked nicely.  The sauce was a litle overbearing (chipotle sauce).  And who the heck puts tortilla chips ON TOP of the fish?  Just doesn't work.\n4) Scallop Noodles: Somebody lay off the butter.  There was so much heavy cream and butter that it was totally inedible.  I know cajun dishes are heavy on butter/cream but c'mon.... this was just rediculous.  The scallops were cooked to perfection however.\n5) Crab cakes - Pure meat.  The crab was fresh.  However, it needs a little somethin.... what happened to the \"essence\" of emeril??? Gimme some more \"BAM\" seasoning\n6) Short ribs - TERRIBLE.  An overcooked piece of tasteless meat.  Try adding some wine, seasoning... ANYTHING!!!\n7) Jambalaya - pretty good.  Some more andouille sausage would be nice.\n8) Bread pudding - decent.  Nothing exceptional.\n9) Apple cobbler - TERRIBLE.  Tasted like sweet glue.  Someone needs to quality check the apples, I think they might be bad.  We told the waiter and he offered to exchange it for us but we didn't want anymore food.\n10) Had a bottle of Chianti The grapes were tasty, however, the wine kept making me sneeze.  It usually only happens when I drink cheap wine....I kept telling myself the bottle was 70 dollars.\n===========================\n\nAccording to my dad, he claims that the restaurant tastes WAAAAY better at lunch (much cheaper too) .  Service was decent, environment was nice.  There's the two stars.  The food certainly didn't match the price.  Why did you close down Commander's Palace (I sure hope it reopens soon)???

I've heard GREAT things about Emeril's other restaurants and thought that he would have interjected some of the same energy, etiquette and pointers on presentation to this location as well.  I guess what some say about him is true...he may be too busy with his celebrity to care about the food anymore.  What a shame. \n\nThis place was accommodating in that I waiting until the last minute to get reservations on a VERY busy Saturday night.  I was told 4 times they were booked solid but thought I would give it one more go in person and was helped by the manager. We had a group of 7 and only had to wait about 10 minutes at 9:00 PM. \n\nThe service was apathetic and while the appetizer of seared scallops tasted amazing...that's where the party ended. We ordered calamari to start for the table based on our servers recommendation and it arrived lumped and soggy in a small white bowl with soy sauce dipper bowls of cocktail sauce.  Others in my group ordered the lobster bisque and while it smelled intoxicating, none of what you smell registers when you actually taste it.  I've had MUCH better. 3 ordered the steak and at $45 you get a massive ROAST size lump of meat heaped on a flavor board...and once again, they used small white bowls to present their mashed potatoes.  They also ordered macaroni and cheese on the side for $11 each as they thought the server said it didn't come with a side and sadly, that was the best part of their meals. They did wrap the steaks to go...for their dogs. I had the pecan crusted Texas redfish with grits and while that was tasty I felt a little guilty looking around at the table of my friends with hopeful smiles for my benefit. We decided to forgo dessert but they brought a very small white bowl of mango sorbet with a candle to wrap things up...unfortunately it was so tart none of us could eat it.\n\nAs we were leaving we asked if they had any connection or if they could help us with passes for Studio 54 and were completely shocked with the blank response of  \"we're not part of the MGM so we have no affiliation with any of their entertainment venues\".  WHAT?! Aren't we sitting in the MGM at your restaurant??? Flippant attitudes need not apply.\n\nFor $130 each with one drink...I would have prefered to go anywhere else for less.  I used to be a huge fan and can honestly say I'll never be back. \n\nI don't like to end reviews on a bad note so I will say the decor was rich and modern and I loved the wine display cases...inspiring option for my own place."

They were going to place us on a tiny two-seater table (I know, restaurants like to use every chair efficiently). But when we requested the spacious booth close by, they gladly gave it to us, even though that booth could've seated a party of four. Our meal from beginning to end was served pretty flawlessly. Waters were filled, crumbs were discreetly brushed away, & I'm not sure I ever noticed this before, but each of our courses were placed in front of us individually. What I mean is when our course arrived, it was brought to us by two servers, and placed down at the exact same time. Not just one server bringing both our dishes one by one. I'm imagining that maybe very fine dining restaurants will do this, but I thought it was a nice touch. \n\nWhat did we think was just A-OK? The food. Everything was cooked accordingly, it's just nothing really wowed us. I could chalk it up to the fact that we don't eat much Louisiana-creole food. Maybe we can't appreciate it as much.\n\nThe desserts were the highlight of our meal. Emeril's Banana Cream Pie is to die for. I can't pass up eating this whenever I eat at any of Emeril's restaurants. The flourless chocolate cake was a bit too dark for me at first bite, then I had another with the cherry compote... YUM!

So I marked it as a place we had to stop off at.\n\nLet me just say that I do not hate Emeril the chef.  And while I can't stand to sit down and watch his cook show, I actually respect him as a cook, more importantly as a philanthropist, with the foundations he has set up and all the work he has done to repairing New Orleans.  That said I think I could have just given one of those foundations 200 bucks cash, and I think I would have been left feeling more satisfied then I did dinning and paying for the meal that I had here.\n\nSo let's begin with the evening, we started out all well and good, and we wanted to try the chefs tasting menu, my g/f who is much smaller then me didn't think she could handle eating four courses, so what we wanted to do was I would order the 4 course tasting menu, and she would pick out three dishes of her own, she was going to get a salad, soup and main and we were just going to split the dessert.  The server then told us we couldn't because the kitchen couldn't get the timing on the dishes going out to the table.  I then asked would it make it better if we ordered two desserts, to which he said no.  He then went and told us that if we each are sitting at the same table and wanted to do the chefs tasting menu we each had to order it.  I asked him, if I were to come alone would I be allowed to order the tasting menu, and he told me I could.  I couldn't figure out or understand why it would be different if two people were sitting at the same table.  Anywho we both got the tasting menu in the end.\n\nSalad:  Blue crab meat, red onion, carrot, cucumber & mixed greens tossed in sweet soy vinaigrette, with fried pickled ginger and sesame seeds.\n\nSimple clean flavors, the crab meat was cooked to keep it's natural sweetness and delicate texture which was great, however the vinaigrette was a bit strong for my tastes can seemed to overpower then entire dish.  It was an OK dish, it did seem like it was something I could go to any fusion-asian restaurant though.\n\nSeafood:  Sweet Barbecued Loch Duart Salmon on Andouille, sausage and potato brabants with spicy onion crust and Emeril's housemade Worcestershire.\n\nWith all the work and things that they did for this dish, it was ultimately forgettable at best, what ever was on the crust for flavor was long gone by the time I got to eat it and with all the elements that went into creating this dish I thought it would have had a bigger impact, additionally, with all the ingredients the presentation of the dish was sloppy.\n\nMeat:  Grilled Pork Tenderloin & baja shrimp on white cheddar, cheese and chive mashed potatoes with caramelized onion reduction and flash fried kale.\n\nWhat can I say about this dish?  This is where things went really down hill.  We got our dishes and first thing I notice is that the portion sizes are different, mine is smaller and more rectangular then hers, and even without cutting it open I knew my piece was way, overcooked, her's on the other hand was pretty questionably undercooked.  (Bloody pork.)  I thought the reason we did this all this was so they could get the cooking time right on the tasting menu!  I was dumbfounded and flagged a server, (ours was no where to be seen) she then looked at it and told us it was normal.  I told her it was the pork dish from the tasting menu not a beef dish.  She then took it back and the chef's went and re-fired her meat.\n\nDesert:  Apple Strudel with Caramel Sauce, Caramel ice cream and whipped cream.\n\nI really didn't get this dish, I thought it was supposed to be a warm strudel dish but that could be enjoyed with the ice cream and Caramel sauce, it was cold the entire dish was cold.  The pastry shell on top was soggy and cold throughout, it was actually frozen to the bottom of the plate.  It was inedible.  Two bites and we were done.\n\nSadly the one good thing that stood out from this night is the bread, it was the only thing that I could say was really good and memorable.  The rest of the menu was forgettable, poorly executed, and frankly a disappointment.  We saw our server only a few times that night, when he came to take our order, when he brought two of our four dishes and the check.  That was it, sadly, it was a very slow weekend, the restaurant was very empty and there was an abundance of wait staff, and bus boys, but for some reason they were all to busy to refill drinks.  The couples at the other tables next to us said they noticed the same thing.  \n\nSo sorry guys, Emeril's may have been a great restaurant at one time, but it wasn't when we were there, and with all the choices of restaurants in Vegas these days, there are plenty of other places I would rather spend my money."

We love cooking shows, so have always wanted to eat at a \"tv chef\" restaurant and we were on a mini-honeymoon--time to splurge!\nService was amazing!  Best....service...ever!  \nFor appetizer, we got the bacon-wrapped scallops.  The scallops were not great.  His was ice-cold in the middle and mine had grit in it.  However, they were on this magical substance that our waiter explained was celery-root puree.  It had asparagus and mushroom pieces in it and I wanted to ask them to forget my dinner and bring me a bowl of that.  It was one of the best things I have ever had in my life.  \nHubby got seared ahi over raviolis and I had the shrimp and lobster pasta.  The ahi was wonderful but didn't quite go with the ravioli.  They were much better eaten separately.  My pasta was fantastic with giant shrimp and big chunks of lobster.  Portions were very good sized surprisingly!  After all that we could barely breathe, but managed to find room for creme brulee made with Baily's.  It was worth squeezing in.  \nOverall, we had a wonderful dinner!  It was pricey but worth it.  We should have just stopped there as our lucky streak did not extend to the tables...."

When you park at the valet in the MGM and then go into the lobby, go left towards the casino and then right. There are signs all over that say \"restaurants\" but they do not say which restaurants. Just an arrow pointing you in different directions. Anyhoo - on to the food. Went in for oysters on the half shell. They had Fanny Bay oysters. Not too bad, but they are served on a bed of spices and salt, not on ice. So the oysters got to room temperature quickly...not a good thing for a fresh oyster. The saving grace was the desert, banana creme pie. That was one of the best deserts I have ever had. Delicious! So why only two stars you ask? Service. Service sucked. the manager seated us, didn't give us menus right away. We ordered just some water with lemon to start off as it was a hot day in Vegas and that took longer than you would have liked to arrive to the table. Then a waitress came back with menus. Just as I was about to say, \"We are just here for oysters\", she walked away. So we waited. Then she came back over to tell us that she would come back for our order in a second. That was a long second. We ordered the food, and an iced tea. The food came, the iced tea didn't. Then she remembered the tea and brought it along with an apology. No break on the bill though. So for 12 oysters an iced tea and one desert the bill was $50. That with the slow service means I can't recommend it."

But I've had some great meals at his NOLA home base, and one of my favorite chefs of all time, Anne Kearney, was an early protege of his.

I went with the New Orleans fare and found it consistently falling a tad short in execution. The crab remoulade had some very nice jumbo lump meat but was served on wilted romaine; the gumbo faintly echoed the flavors of a good one but was badly overcooked, with shrimp the consistency of marshmallows; the barbecue salmon and bread pudding presentations dated.\n\nIn its favor, the place has become a relative bargain as each new Vegas celebrity chef outpost strives to outdo (and out-price) the last.

            "review": "This restaurant is one of MGM Grand's many fine dining establishments. Reservations are required, but it's not too difficult to get one. Now, on to the experience.\n\nAs we are seated, we are introduced to our team of servers. We had 3 people helping a table of 3. I like the numbers already. I ordered a chocolate martini to start off the night. The martini was very strong. It was just an okay martini, not very special. I think the chocolate martini over at New York, New York's Gallagher's is better.\n\nBesides the normal menu, they offer a tasting menu of 7 courses that has been reduced to servings of 3-4 oz each course. The cost was $75 per person. If you wanted wine pairings to go with it, it was an extra $25 per person. Seemed lovely, but probably too much food for one person. We decided to just go for appetizers, entrees, and dessert.\n\nWe started the evening with an order of the Avocado and Blue Crab crabcakes with some sort of slaw. The slaw and the crabcakes made an excellent combination, as well as the avocado and the crab. There was tons of crab in the cakes and the avocado helped to bind the meat together very effectively. I liked it, but didn't love it. On the other hand, I loved the Seared Scallops over a frisee salad with bits of walnut. The bus boy brought a round of breads for each person. Each of us got a corn bread muffin and a piece of onion loaf. Each was delicious. The corn bread was perfectly sweet and moist while the onion loaf was flavorful and not overly strong. Perfect bread.\n\nMy mother ordered the Salmon with some sort of mango sauce. It was grilled perfectly - not overcooked and not undercooked. But salmon is pretty hard to mess up. My father had the fish of the day, which was a Hawaiian Spearfish (Hebi). It was also perfectly cooked. But I have to say, the fish was just fish. Not that crazy or anything. I, on the other hand, went for the Louisiana Cedar Plank Campfire Steak, which was Creole spiced (think: Emeril's Essence), served with Trinity (traditionally celery, carrots, onions), Warm Remoulade (gotta ask Emeril what the heck that is), and Country Smashed Potatoes. The steak was pretty good. I liked the Trinity over it. But I LOVED the mashed potatoes. Potentially the very best mashed potatoes I've ever had. Yeah. That good. Needless to say, I at only half of the steak and a few spoonfuls of the potatoes because I was pretty full already. I happily took a doggy bag home because I was saving room for dessert.\n\nI had some espresso to help wash down my food. My mother had plain coffee. The coffee was not spectacular. I think the buffet had better drip coffee. The espresso was just fine, but again not great. What WAS great was the dessert: Emeril's signature Banana Cream Pie with Banana Crust, Chocolate Shavings and Caramel Sauce. Heavenly. It was not too sweet. It was not too creamy. It was perfect. The crust was also delicious.\n\nOverall, I would say a 4 out of 5. However, the service was really excellent. They were on top of everything. As soon as you put your silverware on the plates, they came right away and knew you were done. They pull out the chairs for you and let you take your time without you feeling forgotten. So, I'd say the service alone pushes it to a 5 out of 5. I highly recommend the place.\n\nWe gave a hefty tip, and all in all, the total was $200 for 3 people (no wine, just 1 martini and 2 fountain drinks).\n\nUPDATE 8/17/2009: Went back a few times recently and the food was not that great. Not a lot of choices in fish - strange for a fish restaurant! Anyway, the banana cream pie was just as perfect as I remembered. I think the slice was smaller though. Must be the economy!"

The food was excellent and the lobster bisque was different from any we had ever had.  To be honest it was so good we started asking about it when we went back but they no longer served it that often.  We were told to call a few days ahead when we returned and they would make it for us.  Which we did but what we got the next time was just standard lobster bisque nothing like what we had the first time.   The food was still good but the service is a bit over the top.  However the last time we went there was hardly anyone there and the food was not as good.  We went at lunch and what really struck me as odd was the cheap rols they were serving.  These rolls where the same sweet ones you get at any discount store and frankly even I wont buy them.  I was rather insutling when the waiter served them with his silver tongs.   Cheap rolls are cheap rolls no matter how you serve them.  The rest of the food was good but not as good and I honestly do not know if the prices are worth a repeat.  We were one of only two tables there which says a lot right at the noon hour."

Loved the restaurant, the service and the experience so much that I asked my wife to marry me here 10 years ago. Last year we came in, and service was very poor, but we love the food so much that we decided to try it again on this trip. \n\nWe went for a late lunch and decided to sit at the bar for happy hour. After waiting a few minutes, we finally got menus and water but the bartender rushed away without saying a word. Another 10 minutes passed before I called the bartender over to ask if we could actually order a drink. She took our order, and then proceeded to seat and serve 2 other people next to us, and then served food to 4 people at the far end of the bar. She finally came over to say she is very busy. Mind you, we were 4 of 10 total people at the bar, and I counted at least 12 employees, not a single one doing anything, and the dining room had 2 tables. \n\nNext problem, everyone of our 4 drinks could not be made because their CO2 tanks were not working. So she disappeared again. I saw what I'm assuming was a manager because he was the only one in a suit, VERY nonchalantly finally come over and shake a wire, and then walk away. Still nothing. I finally get the bartender to take our food order while our 4 glasses of water sat empty, and we got 2 bottles of beer because apparently it was the only drink they could offer. \n\nFood arrives, BBQ shrimp is still absolutely amazing, even though the size of the shrimp seems to be getting smaller & smaller during every visit. Main course shows up.... shrimp po'boy. While the shrimp was very good, the bread was stale, & the lettuce and tomato seemed like leftovers from the day before at best. I got the sauce on the side because I've read that they tend to overdress it. I ate the shrimp and dipped in the Cajun sauce which gets 4 out of 5 stars from me but the complete sandwich would get a 2 if I was feeling generous \n\nI get the bill within seconds of asking for it, and not even an apology for the lack of being able to provide what we wanted, or for the poor service. I'm never one to want free stuff, but an acknowledgment of the failure on their part would have been nice. I'm typically at least a 20% tipper if not more if the experience is good, but She got a 5% tip, which was generous. Had they at least had 15-20 customers, the staff of at least 15 people been slightly busy, I could have over looked some of it, but this was just a complete lack of standards from the onsite manager down to our bartender. \n\nI really wish someone would go back and review the standards in this place because it used to be a destination that I went out of my way for, but at this point it is officially part of the past. Such a shame."

Emeril saved a little face with the large Carmel creme brulee, it was done just right, great balance between the sweet and bitter.

The drinks were far too weak for our tastes, but we went through a number (5?  7?  9?) of rounds of them because they were so incredibly cheap.  Like everywhere else in the MGM Grand, the bar staff was completely professional and on top of their game.  While this might warrant enough for a 4 star review outside of Vegas, competition is stiff for business within these hotels.  I simply think NobHill and Wolfgang Puck have a bit more to offer customers of the hotel."

My FIL's meal was exactly the same meal I had at Todd's a couple weeks ago (seared fish, Israeli couscous, lemony sauce).  Mashed potatoes with blue crab served as the \"surf\" in the hubster's \"surf 'n turf,\" though, to be fair, that was a student's menu contribution through one of Emeril's charities.  \n\nWe ordered the gumbo, which was delicious, and oysters to start.

The shank was so large that I easily had enough to bring home to use for soup.\n\nOverall it was a great meal and a good experience, but not necessarily the best I've ever had.\n\nOn second thought...the banana cream pie.

It was tender, falling apart with the lightest pressure, and the meat was just delicious. My main course was the BBQ salmon. The BBQ sauce was also top notch. The salmon itself was good, though just a *tad* overcooked, in that it was merely good instead of melt-in-your-mouth delicious. All in all, it was a worthy follow-up to an incredible appetizer.\n\nNow we get to the downsides: I went with Bananas Foster for dessert. The sauce was cold, the banana chunks far too small, and the whole twist on a classic New Orleans dessert just seemed to miss the mark. Disappointing. Our server was also... how shall I put it... obsequious. Rather than waiting for lulls in the conversation, he attempted to talk over several in our party, which resulted in him having to repeat the options multiple times. He went into ridiculous detail about how the wines tasted, but it seemed recited from memory rather than personal experience. Three times we ordered wines only to have him come back and inform us that they were all out. I asked if they had any lambic beers and was informed they did not; upon reviewing the beer list I promptly found Lindeman's Framboise. There were too many rookie moves, like serving some in our party with the wrong hand (if you're serving someone on their right, you need to use your right hand so that your elbow isn't in their space).\n\nMy 3 star rating is admittedly grading on a curve. For a restaurant like this I have pretty high expectations, particularly about the service. Would I come back again? Absolutely, if only for the crab cakes. Could it have been better? Yes."

The sauce drizzled on the side was tangy and perfect for the scallop and the spinach was to die for (was marinated in something delicious - I gobbled it all up). \n\nWe shared the GUMBO and being a southern gal myself, I have to say it was very good, not spicy though. I've had Gumbo many ways and enjoy most all ways but like it best when the Gumbo is not too thick. This was on the thick side but still great. \n\nI had ordered one of the new items on the menu, the FOIE GRAS with Blackberry jam, which came in small slices, drizzled in a bit of bb jam, a few crackers and a small bowl of blackberry jam on the side. I absolutely loved this, it was tender and flavorful and with the jam on top.. yum!!! This is not a regular menu item, so you may not find it.\n\nThen of course, desert... my husband had the KEY LIME MOUSSE which had the perfect amount of key lime flavor, was almost frozen it was so cold and it melted on your tongue like butter.\n\nI being southern, had to have the BANANA CREAM PIE, and no lie, it was light & fluffy, with wonderful curls of thin chocolate on top. \n\nThe SERVICE you ask?  The staff, was so friendly and wonderful, made sure we got out in time for our show and brought us bread & tea until we had to ask them to stop!\n\nALL IN ALL IT WAS THE BEST MEAL IN VEGAS!!!

            "review": "A return visit to Emeril's courtesy of Spring Restaurant Week 2013.  Their menu sounded interestingly enough as this one restaurant ended up being our only visit during RW.  What makes their RW menu a bit different from others is that they were offering a four course meal for $50.13 versus a three course.\n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday with reservations in hand.  This was a good thing because they were especially busy this night with lots of events going on at MGM.  We were advised that service would take longer than usual because of how busy things were.  We appreciated the upfront warning.\n\nOur menu choices:\n\n* Heirloom Tomato Salad \"Spanish Blue Cheese, Red Onion, Basil and Aged Balsamic\" - A bit disappointing.  The tomatoes were rather mushy, as in possibly overripe.  We usually love heirloom tomatoes, but we weren't loving this one.\n\n* Cold Smoked Salmon Tartare \"Crispy Flatbread, Whole Grain Mustard Aioli and Watercress\" - I'm afraid to say this, but it was underseasoned.  Yes, that's right.  Even with the freshly ground pepper, it just was blah.  I had to add salt and more pepper to wake up the dish.  The aioli was minimal, so it didn't really do much to enhance the fish at all.\n\n* Emeril's Fall River Clam Chowder \"Apple Wood Smoked Bacon & Potato\" - This soup was rich, hearty, and very flavorful.  It was one really good bowl of clam chowder soup.\n\n* Chicken, Shrimp, & Andouille Gumbo \"Long Grain Rice & Shaved Green Onion\" - This was some pretty good gumbo.  It had so much going on in terms of yummy goodness and a deep developed flavor.  We were very impressed.  (We recently had gumbo at another fine dining establishment and let's say their version does not come close to Emeril's.)\n\n* Grilled Double Cut Pork Chop \"Chive & Potato Puree, Fresh Pea Tendrils and Toy Box Charm Tomatoes\" - This was a very generous portion of protein after our first two dishes. It had a very tasty crust and probably should have been enjoyed during this seating.  It was just too much for myself and I had to take the rest to go.  The Husband made the mistake of eating the whole thing and couldn't eat much dessert after.  (His loss.)  The fresh pea tendrils literally looks like they just cut it from the garden.  It doesn't really do much to the dish beyond adding color.\n\n* New Orleans Bread & Butter Bread Pudding - I normally don't  order bread pudding but theirs is pretty good.  I was already so stuffed but couldn't stop eating it.\n\n* Emeril's Banana Cream Pie - Another dessert that I don't usually choose, but it's pretty good too!  It was fluffy and creamy, not overly chunky or heavy.  I think that's what we both liked - two desserts that we don't normally like but really enjoyed here.\n\nService was good overall.  Water glasses were filled and the staff were constantly moving.  Sure, there were some hit and misses throughout our meal, but it started off weak and built itself up and ended strong.  In the future, I know that their starters aren't their strongest suit."

In fact for the most part I don't like seafood and that may be where the problem lies. There wasn't much on the menu that wasn't seafood (this was not my choice to go here as I was with a group). The service was excellent and I have to say that the dessert (the bannana cream pie) was some of the best I have ever had and I would return just for dessert."

I recommend the steak from here as they marinate it for 21 days and cook it to perfection.  I don't recommend the chicken here, it was bland and ordinary, nothing was that great about it.  I loved the service, they offered \"share plates,\" so others at the table can try what you ordered.  The rolls were soft and really fresh/piping hot.  I recommend this restaurant if you are hungry and close to the MGM Grand."

My husband had Crab Slidders, which  weren't that great.  And I had the $27. Jumbalaya which should have been $8.  At least the carmel creme brulee was worth every penny.\nWe had three waiters which was excessive, and the atmosphere was nothing special.

Once reaching the hostess stand, we were greeted and immediately taken to a booth.  Despise the Valentine's Day rush, we were greeted almost immediately by our waiter Lawrence.  He was very professional and well knowledgable throughout the entire dinner experience. Never once were we rushed through our amazing dining experience.  Our drink order was taken immediately and was served with warm bread.  As we waited very shortly for our appetizers, a small bite sized tasting was placed before us. An absolute surprise that definitely started our night off right.  As appetizers, we had an apple salad and oysters. Absolutely amazing. Perfect portion size and flavor combinations.  We went with the barbeque salmon that was plated atop of vegetables, potatoes, and sausage. Piled on top of the salmon was a creole onion crust. My boyfriend ordered a medium-rare steak. It came out at the perfect temperature. The size was large, but that's what I expected from Emeril's.  Lawrence stopped by our table to deliver a rose.  His service was incredible and definitely exceeded our expectations.  The managers stopped by to assure that everything was taken care of to our liking, which is amazing to have that one-on-one interaction.  You can definitely tell they cared about this establishment.  We of course had to try the banana cream pie, their specialty. It was one-of-a-kind.  Along side was a great moscato to end the night right. Both waiters had wished us a great night and another thank you from another employee on the way out of the door.  All in all, an amazing experience with delectable food and service with a smile."

While the restaurants in the MGM hotel are \"open\" because you can see the gaggle of crowds walking by, this place still gives a nice intimate feel.  I came here with about 5-6 coworkers and we were able to have nice dinner conversation. \n\nWhat I ordered: \n-Seafood gumbo:  This had a nice kick to it and had a good amount of seafood and veggies to it.  I really liked it and wanted another plate, but decided not to.  \n\n-Seafood pan roast - a good amount of seafood and sausage. It wasn't the largest portion and I thought it could have been bigger, but everything went well together. From the fish to the mussels to the sausage, it was an explosion of flavours.\n\nOverall, if you have the budget, this is a great place to try in Vegas."

            "review": "Our lunch at the Fish House was interesting.  It was a Saturday, but the back half of the place was empty.  This is where our group of 5 was seated.  I don't know if they forgot about us back there, but the service left a lot to be desired.  We waited a long time on our food, and for the check.  So, that was a little annoying.\n\nI had the clam chowder, which was very good but lacked seasoning.  It is brought to you in a metal, maybe cast iron (I don't know), bowl.  Then, it's poured into your bowl to eat.  This kept the soup hot until the end, which I liked.  Good size pieces of clam and a lot of potatoes.  Certainly hearty.  But, like I said, lacked seasoning so I had to add salt and pepper.\n\nMy wife had the caesar salad.  This was 2 large slices of romaine with a good amount of dressing.  It was too acidic for my tastes.  There were 2 long cheese breadsticks that were good though.\n\nI had the fried shrimp po' boy for my entree.  I really liked this sandwich.  I took my first bite and found the bread overwhelming the meal.  So, I (like the other 2 at our table that ordered this) ate the remainder open faced.  This was the way to go.  It's a good sauce with some kick and plenty of shrimp.  Never had a bite without shrimp, which a lot of places skimp on in sandwiches.  I will definitely get this again.  It's served with creole fries.  These were long and thin and had seasoning on them.  They were also good, and I got so many I didn't come close to finishing them.\n\nThe shrimp and grits (which my wife ordered) was not as successful.  The shrimp were overcooked and the grits lacked flavor.  I think they needed more cheese.  Also, the sauce lacked heat that you would expect at a cajun/creole place.  So, we likely won't get this again.  But, the meal wasn't a bust for me, I recommend the shrimp po' boy."

First of all, the bacon and fontina macaroni and cheese was out of this world. Every bite was better than the one before it. For my entree, I ordered the All-American Angus burger (not exactly the most refined item on the menu, but I wanted to see how it tasted), and, as expected, was delicious. The fries it came with weren't very remarkable, but the sandwich... I'm the type of person to devour his food before his taste buds process its flavor, but I was doing everything in my power to make this meal last as long as possible. Also, our server that night was nothing short of incredible. Not only was he was polite, friendly and attentive, but he gave my girlfriend an employee discount on the check just because she works inside the MGM, and gave us a passion fruit sorbet to split because her birthday was 5 days before that night. If every other experience is like the one I had, I will DEFINITELY be back."

To be completely honest, the meal was somewhat of a downer. Without a doubt, the Mac-n-Cheese was the highlight of the meal. The cheese was so gooey and smokey. It was perfection! Conversely, the ribeye was pretty tough and bland, instead of being juicy and tender. The Scottish salmon was good, I enjoyed it, but I wasn't wowed by it. When you're spending $100+ for a meal for two, you expect to be WOWed by every single bit. And sadly, I wasn't."

It is decorated in soft blues, wave like wood accents and wavy metal sculptures with sand colored Walls and aqua leathers. \n\nService at the bar was quick and efficient.\n\nI started with the Chicken, Shrimp & Andouille Gumbo with Long Grain Rice & Green Onion.  It was excellent.  Just the right degree of spice and cooked perfectly.\n\nI also tried the Tequila and Lime marinated fish tacos.   there were nice pieces of fish on warm flour tortillas with a pico consisting of tomatoes, black beans some large pieces of avocado.  They were topped with a jalapeno sour cream. They were pretty good but lacking that expect Bam! (sorry, I couldn't resist)  However, a little of Emeril's green pepper sauce spiced the up nicely.\n\nThe gumbo, tacos and a glass of Merlot were just under $40 before the tip.

For starters I had the clam chowder bowl and I am not lying when I say, best clam chowder in my life! Very creamy and flavorful. As my entree I ordered the lobster ($38). Very tasty but a small portion for the price but I know that's how it goes when you try to be fancy. LOL. The sauce in the lobster and ricotta was very creamy and delicious! The bf ordered New York strip steak and received a huge portion. He was very satisfied and I quote \"the best steak in my life!\" We ended with dessert and took our waiters suggestion and got the banana cream pie!! TO DIE FOR!!! This is a must try!! Rich, but not too sweet and every bite was pure satisfaction! \n\nAn overall amazing experience. The service was friendly and prompt. I swear the water guy would fill up our glasses once we took a sip. I had to tell him I was Ok after the 5th refill. A must go-to restaurant if you're in Vegas and near the MGM."

This was my first time dining in any of Emeril's restaurants so needless to say I had high hopes for being blown away with flavor.\nWe figured what better time to try We came in on Wednesday during restaurant week.\nLike the smart people we are, we made reservations for an off time 9PM and were rewarded with quick seating at an awesome table near the servers desk (sense the sarcasm?)\n\nIt's funny you figure since we were close to the servers desk that we would not have to worry about flagging down or look for our waitress but sadly that wasn't the case. \nA little tip for the wait staff: you shouldn't talk crap about your tables or guests in front of the other guests. While it was entertaining, it's unprofessional. \n\n\nFood: \nWe ordered off of the restaurant week menu. \n\n\nThe shining dish of our dining experience was the pretzel bread! WOW I've had pretzel bread from other places but damn! this one is a winner! Salty hard pretzel exterior and soft bead guts. I asked them for at least 4 of these bad boys! 5* on the free bread!\n\nOur menu selections:\nRomaine hearts ceasar salad\nThis dish honestly failed to wow me in any way it felt like a lazy salad idea as it was plated with 3 romaine spears with cheese and dressing. I would've have preferred a \"normal\" ceasar salad over this version. \n\nClam Chowder\nEmeril's version of clam chowder was decent but didn't have any zing or \"bam!\" as the man himself would say. I could tell that the clams used were fresh as there was a bit of sand and grit at the bottom of my bowl (this is a good thing)\n\nHorseradish blue shrimp w/ cous cous and cauliflower.\nThis sounded awesome on the menu but sadly it did not come close to what was advertised. The shrimp was overcooked and were almost rubbery enough that you could bounce them like a basketball. Seasoning? There was not a single hint of horseradish to be found on the plate! I will say that the cous cous served were very interesting. they were light and fluffy and had a tobiko (fish egg) like texture to it. It's sad when that was the most memorable part of any of the dishes I ordered.\n\nBBQ Salmon\nI know I should've ordered this instead. A nice quality slice of fish with a hint of bbq marinade and smoke in the meat however I wish that they let the heavy coat of BBQ sauce caramelize a bit before serving it because by just slathering a coat on before it's served cheapens the dish up. It was the better of the 2 main entree's that we ordered. \n\n\nFlour-less Chocolate Cake:\nI respect an establishment that has yummies for the anti-gluten patrons. I am pro-gluten and pro-chocolate so sacrifices had to be made... Not a bad little chocolate cake, it could almost pass as a \"normal\" dry chocolate cake if I didn't know beforehand.\n\n\nAll in all, I would be lying if I said I would recommend this place to dine. For a mid-high end resort restaurant with a name brand chef's name attached to it I would expect better. None of the dishes had any sense of seasoning or beloved BAM in it that you would come to expect from Emeril and the only good thing that was memorable was the pretzel bread.... The Man himself needs to come to his restaurant before they have to recruit Robert Irvine to save this place...."

I've never had such good calamari in my life until now! \n\nMy friends all loved what they ordered. While I really liked the apple and butter lettuce salad that I asked for, I thought it wasn't worth the price paid for the portion size and what went in the dish. But that isn't important because my goal of coming here is to try the butter and bread pudding and with that aim, I did. The bread pudding came in a very small portion and at first, I thought that was strange since eyeing the enormous size of banana cream pie slice, I almost freaked out at how big it was. However, I think this bread pudding was meant to be savored little chunks at a time and savored it I did!!! Oh man, it was so warm and buttery and had just the right amount of sweetness. I literally felt a spike of happiness while eating this dessert. Apparently Emeril Lagasse knows bread pudding like a pro as well! \n\nIn the distant future, I will come back here for this bread pudding, after I work off the calories amassed tonight of course."

I'm not a fan of mojitos, but their Poolside Cruzan Mojito is really good! It's so much more refreshing than any mojitos I've ever had!\n\nTheir bar bites are $5-$9. They have a lot of interesting things like Po-Boy sliders, crawfish fritters, and ahi tuna tacos, but I didn't have any of that. I had their $1.50 oysters instead. It was so fresh like they just got their oysters from the ocean that day!\n\nMy husband was so in love with their oysters that we decided to come back before our flight back to San Jose. He said they were some of the best he ever had. With suitcases in hand, we practically ran here. We were 3 minutes late for happy hour and the hostesses insisted that happy hour was over. That was fair and that was fine, but I was a bit irritated when one of them said, \"We already have a long happy hour.\" At least she forced a smile on her snobby face when she said that."

Second time here had a Ranger which was much better.\n\nGarden salad is a bit on the tart side but has some pleasant flavors. Croutons, radicchio, bib lettuce, cucumber, and a couple other unfamiliar items. The seafood gumbo is alright. Could be hotter in temperature but on the spice side it has a nice little kick. Comes with sausage, shrimp, and okra. The rice is a tad too \"al dente\" for me.\n\nSecond trip. Corn bread still a home run. Trying the collard greens and bacon Mac n cheese. The mac n cheese is really tasty with a nice crust. Nice sharpness but not too sharp. Greens taste great. They are meant to be shared. The Mac is a bit smaller.\n\nStaff has been great."

Started off with oysters, 4 for 14 ( whatever, it's Vegas ). Came out at a warm temperature which can be dangerous for any patron. I asked the waiter if this was supposed to be like this? He's said no and checked with the manger/chef. Came back and comp the oysters ( thanks bud, coulda died for 14 dollars).\n\nMy buddy and i both ordered the same entree which was the Pan Roasted Black Bass with basil pesto, sicilian capitone sauce and crispy pancetta. Both dishes come out and mine is missing the pancetta. Really? Manager came over and apologized and brought out the side dish of the three miniscule pieces of pancetta. They should of left it off because it didn't even go well with the dish. \n\nWould i recommend Emeril's to friends and family? I rather defuse a bomb or sit at Le Bernardin and only order water. Of course i'll pick the latter."

They're out of it on a busy 3 Day Holiday weekend - Wah Wah....Thought about taking ANOTHER star off, but they bounced back and brought us the entire selection of desserts out fit for an army, and they were all great, especially the chocolate cake (even though Emeril is famous for the Banana Cream Pie - we got that too) - the cake - wow - we couldn't eat it all obviously - so they packed it up for us and we took it into the MGM arena...So overview - great spot - bring money - if we go back and we have bad service - I'm taking them down a couple of stars - You have been warned Emeril - BAM!"

The shrimp cocktail was good. The market oysters were teeny tiny, about the size of a quarter.\n\nWe then ordered the hot apps of charbroiled oysters and the crab cake. The charbroiled oysters were lukewarm at best, with absolutely zero seasoning, toppings, etc. Charbroiled or char grilled oystesrs in New Orleans are an amazing, unique flavor, topped with tons of garlic and Parmesan and smokiness from the grill. These were inedible.\n\nThe crab cake, supposedly a number one seller was disgusting. The sauce they served with it was so sweet, it distracted from the sub par crab cake. I was going to ask for remoulade (perfect with crab cakes) but decided to ask for a manager instead.\n\nThe manager came over, and I expressed my issues. He ended up comping off everything but the drinks and shrimp cocktail. We tipped the waiter 100% of the bill. Why the manager would not comp the entire bill when someone had such a disastrous experience with the food is beyond me. \n\nI travel to New Orleans at least twice a year, and Vegas twice a year as well. This restaurant is no more creole or cajun than an Applebees. I'm just assuming, I have never been to an Applebees."

Ambience - a five! This is my first visit since they've redone the place, and it soars above the previous incarnation.\n\n2. Service -- a five! It was impeccable. Every person we encountered did their job perfectly.\n\n3. Price -- a four. Ok...it's the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, so you have to expect to pay. The wine list, however, did seem a bit bloated with more one, two and three \"C-note\" bottles than necessary. I had to seak out the lowly $40 Chardonnay befitting my modest budget. The entrees also called for a %-age or two  more pain than might seem necessary.\n\n4. The drinks -- a three. A Hendricks martini with olives -- excellent....but why the additional price? It was good, but no better...and not any larger than the same elsewhere.\n\n5. The entree -- a four. The sea bass special was very good...not any better, however, than many other more moderately priced SB elsewhere.\n\n6. The dessert -- A ZERO. Bread pudding......?!?! Huh??? It was a load of warm, whiskey-hinted [not soaked] cream sauce with a few \"turdlettes\" of bread pudding bobbing to the surface now and then. I must admit, in candor, that I like my BP on the dry side, but even so....this was a tasteless exercise in disappointment. [For those of you who wander in and out of Claremont, CA -- try The Press's version. And you \"Emeril\" people might give it a try too!]\n\n7. The \"hot starter\": MINUS FIVE. Let me spell out what I ordered....so you can \"drink in\" the irony -- M-A-R-Y-L-A-N-D B-L-U-E C-R-A-B C-A-K-E.   This is a \"New Orleans\" restaurant, right?? And isn't blue crab a *specialty*? Well, I was EXPECTING an excellent version of the justly famous MBCC! What I got was something that your local Denny's might THROW AWAY as inferior!! Sure there were *some* flakes of Blue Crab in it....barely discernable from the breading! AND it was coated.....heavily coated with STUFF -- then deep fried!!!! Oh Emeril, Emeril, Emiril....whither goest thou?!?! I'm a devotee of *both* \"Live\" and \"Essence,\" and I know I've seen E himself prepare REAL MBCC's. I expected no less at his NOFH....but received far far far less!! [Just give me a pound or two of fresh lump and a can of Old Bay, and I WILL SHOW YOUR COOKS WHAT TO DO WITH IT.] Maybe the $8 per CC should have tipped me off....instead it just ticked me off!\n\nI'm from Baltimore and I know crab cakes....but these, Mr. Celebrity Chef, were no crab cakes."

It's a cream-based bisque that is really smooth and velvety.  Others ordered the bbq ribs, macaroni and cheese, and the chargrilled oysters as appetizers.  For dinner, I had the shrimp and sausage pasta.  The shrimp were pretty large and the sausage was very flavorful.  For dessert, the group shared the bread pudding (very smooth) and key lime pie.  The pie had a velvety smooth texture.  Not your usual key lime pie.  Both were amazing!  The restaurant's ambiance is modern and contemporary.  Even though we didn't have reservations, we were seated right away (there was only 4 in our party).  It was a Friday night around 7:30 pm and they weren't very busy.  It was also the Friday after Thanksgiving.  I think it was a slow season for Vegas.  Overall, the restaurant was superb.  A little pricey, but you are paying for the Emeril name.

Unfortunately, both our phones were out of batteries so I chose a place that wasn't super packed but was also a new experience, and it turned out better than I could've hoped for! I guess it was just a coincidence that Emeril was one of the main judges for the most recent Top Chef season...in New Orleans...\n\nFirst thing I noticed while walking past the bar towards our table was a trio of cheesecakes that I knew I had to order at the end. Since I'm not familiar with creole cuisine, we skipped the regular appetizers on the menu and went straight to the New Orleans appetizers. The bbq shrimp was good, and what made it special for me were the biscuits since it made it a genuine creole experience. The baked oysters were so tasty with tiny hints of bacon in them. A memorable start so far.\n\nSeeing as how this is ultimately a seafood restaurant, we shared the baked lobster and the barbeque salmon. First of all, the amount of lobster is not a joke. It's substantial and really really good. The balance between the flavors and heartiness of the lobster and the bbq salmon were wonderful. The salmon brought a lighter feel to the meal and had no complaints with the andouille sausage it was paired with. If you love lobster, you will not be disappointed here. \n\nWe sat next to a couple and the gentleman was celebrating his 60th bday coinciding with valentines day weekend and we shared a delightful dessert conversation.

Quail appetizer was quite nice.  Negatives: pork chop was dry, savory pudding side dish served with the pork was good but just a bit too salty for my taste.  And \"agast!\" the beignets were dry and hard...a cardinal sin for a New Orleans-style restaurant to mess up the beignets.  For shame!

But what really caught my eye was the specials they had one day - Lobster Bisque and Striped Sea Bass. That just sounded really really good. \n\nBefore I sat down, they asked me my name, which I thought was weird. But when the waiter came over and addressed me with Mr. B, I realized that is why they asked me. He asked me what I wanted to drink and all I could think of then was water. When he brought my water back, I ordered the lobster bisque and also asked what type of beer they had. They have a huge selection of wines - the bottles are all over the place. They also had a huge selection of beers. And, as I mentioned to the waiter, since this was Emeril's place, did they have Abita? Heck yeah, I ordered a Turbo Dog.\n\nNow, here is where the fun begins. Do you know when you see those people in the fancy restaurants on TV when they get a lot of people rushing towards your table with everything you need. Well, that is what happened when they brought my Lobster Bisque to me. The waiter put down my bisque, followed by the bread guy, and then followed by the beer guy. They just kept coming and coming. haha\n\nThe lobster bisque was amazing. The flavor of the lobster was, and this term usually means something bad but in this case it isn't, overpowering. By that, I mean there was lots of lobster flavor, yet you could still taste all of the individual ingredients. When chefs say that on TV, I always laugh. But in this case that is exactly what they did. \n\nNext up, the Striped Sea Bass. This was cooked with bell peppers, baby spinach, russet potatoes, and a rosemary garlic (BAM!) reduction. They also had a striped sea bass on the menu prepared differently, but this was the special so I got that. I ordered a second Turbo Dog when the sea bass got there. The combination of the two was fantastic. Perfect flavor combo. The rosemary garlic (BAM!) reduction was incredible with the fish. \n\nTo top off this perfect meal, I ordered a coffee and their Bread & Butter Bread Pudding with Warm Whiskey Sauce. \n\nAnd, I can't forget to mention the service. The service here rocked. My waiter was always around and they paid close attention to my \"fluid levels\" throughout the night. My water was always refilled quickly, as well as my coffee. The waiter knew the menu very well and was able to describe everything (I heard him describing some of the specials to the table next to me and he wasn't just delivering a \"script.\" He was describing things in great detail). All of my dishes and place settings were picked up promptly and the silverware was also picked up between the current courses.\n\nI always stay at the MGM when I go to Vegas, so this will become my \"regular\" place after my recent visit. Next time I'm going to try that Filet Mignon au poivre."

Park in the garage, walk in through the Star Lane Shops, go through the casino to the Studio Walk shops and there you'll find Emeril's New Orleans Fish House.  Well, I found out it's worth the pain.  I had a show at the Venetian at 8 PM, so I made a reservation with Open Table for 5:30 and I was seated immediately.\n\nThen began service that was equal to some of the finest restaurants at which I've eaten in this  town.  One of three people was always aware, in an unobtrusive way, where I was with any of the courses.  Within seconds of finishing a course, someone was there to ask if they could remove the dish.  When my iced tea was almost finished, a new glass was brought and replaced the old one without having to ask.  And, Emeril's passed my pink packet test with an A+ grade!  I began this review with the service first because I wanted it to be the stand out it was.\n\nFor the first course, I chose the Caesar salad with romaine hearts, parmesan cheese, roasted garlic grissini and a creamy house dressing.  Most of the description comes from the menu.  The dressing and shredded parmesan were outstanding.\n\nFor course two, I had to go with the gumbo.  After all, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House, isn't it a law you have to try the gumbo.  It was a mixture of shrimp, chicken and Andouille pork suasage with okra and rice.  The gumbo had the proper thickness and it was peppery spicy, not hot sauce spicy.  it was very good.\n\nFor the main course, I went with the sweet barbecued Atlantic salmon.  My waiter said the chef suggested medium rare cooking.  I told him it could be closer to rare and that's just the way it was.  As the menu states, accompanying the salmon were \"spicy Andouille pork sausage hash, crystal fried onion crust And Emeril's house made Worcestershire.\"  There were pieces of Andouille, cubed potatoes, and some fresh tomatoes.  The salmon was excellent and the barbecue cooking gave me the chance to try salmon prepared in a different manner.\n\nTo end this dinner, I chose an item not on their online RW Week menu but is on their normal menu.  It's the flourless bourbon chocolate cake with sweet cherry compote and peanut butter mousse.  What a combination!  Delicious chocolate cake with some peanut butter mousse and some cherries.  One forkful was a blast of different flavors.  This is a winner.  There were also some chopped, glazed nuts for texture.\n\nThis was an excellent beginning to my Restaurant Week. \n\nNote to M Life members.  If you take your receipt to the M Life club, they'll give you M Life points for the value of your dinner but you can't get it directly from Emeril's."

There was definitely potential here but the execution was about as lazy as I can recall from a major restaurant.\n\nThe tomatoes were too thick and kind of mealy, the bread was far too dense and unyielding, the shrimp, though well cooked, were sparse and kept falling out of the sandwich, and the Creole mayo was far too sparingly applied to make any impact.\n\nThe fries were good, at least. (But the corn bread that was served before the meal was dry and hard.)\n\nIt didn't help, either, that the table next to us had some issue with the menu so our waiter essentially ignored us once the food arrived. (I'd wanted to look at a dessert menu but gave up after 15 minutes.)"

Ordered appetizers frog legs and crab cakes, both were delicious -- actually the crab cake was exceptional. Frog legs was tender and the seasoning was good, similar to buffalo wings only it's the leg of frogs.  The kids even liked them. Next came the soups--two orders each of gumbo and clam chowder. Delicious on both counts: not salty, ingredients in the soup were not over or under cooked which can happen in gumbos and chowders. The entrees were 3 pan roast jambalaya and two seafood pasta (forgot actual name). Yeah it could have been more varied but everyone wanted what they wanted. Overall good taste and fresh (we have one in our party with shrimp allergy and was able to eat the shrimps without even a mild reaction meaning: fresh).  \n\nService was good. They use a tag team system so two servers attended to our table. Christian and Gil both did a solid job. We ordered five bottles of sparkling water but didn't consume the fifth. I mention this point bc they poured water for us and could have easily opened the last one but instead they were observant and automatically took it off the bill.  \n\nWe were too full for dessert but decided to order a beignet to share for the heck of it. Sauce was good but the fried dough was just ok. \n\nOverall it was a great experience. With gratuity the dinner came to just over $500. We read other reviews about how they felt their meal was pricey or not the value for the amount spent. It's a featured restaurant in a resort hotel folks .. so expect to pay more for the experience and adjust expectations accordingly.  We think it's a disservice to both the restaurant and future patrons to give the restaurant a good review for food and service then ding it down a star or two bc it was \"expensive\".  We budgeted well in advance for the dinner so when the bill came it didn't surprise us or disturb the good time we were having."

            "review": "Just got back from Vegas and had a nice dinner at Emeril's Fish House, which is just outside the MGM Grand Casino (btw, you won't find any signs leading to Emeril's from inside the casino).    \n\nWe had the 'petite prix fixe' four course dinner , $55.  The first course was a shrimp appetizer dish.  Peeled, succulent, BIG shrimp over some julienned veggies, surrounded by an intense balsamic vinegar reduction drizzled around the plate.  Very nice.\n\nSecond course was the lobster cassoulet.  Wow.  Delicious, savory, and elegant dish.  Tender baby lobster tail with a delicious broth, beans, and some diced veggies.  \n\nThird course was the main course - a thinly sliced ribeye over creamed spinach.  Here is where there was a small hiccup.  We ordered the ribeye medium rare but instead it came out rare.  Luckily we didn't mind, especially since the meat was of such high quality that it was still tender rare.  You know when the meat quality is top notch when rare steaks are not chewy.   This was the case at Emeril's.  Excellent dish yet again.  The creamed spinach had a subtle kick to it - I tasted a hint of horseradish.  At this point our stomachs were very satisfied and we were glad that we did not go for the full tasting menu which was something like another $20-30 for an additional 2 or 3 dishes.  Not sure how we were going to eat our way through the last course - dessert.\n\nDessert - choice of banana cream pie and bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  We had one of each and they were both excellent, especially the banana cream pie which is exceptionally noteworthy since I do NOT like banana cream pie at all and try to avoid it at all cost.  However, this was the best banana cream pie I have ever had.  Despite being full, we devoured both desserts fully and waddled out of there, very satisfied and felt like the $55 pp dinner was a very good deal indeed.\n\nA word about the ambiance - not much there.  We felt like the restaurant was nicely decorated, but it was too large of a space and therefore felt cold - not temperature cold, but lacking character.  Also, we noticed the service entrance was very stark and obvious - tables situated right next to openings to the kitchen, uncovered.  It cheapened the look of the place, in our opinion.  Didn't bother us too much but of course we value food over ambiance any day.\n\nService - excellent wait staff.  Before seating the host properly asked if we had a show to catch after the dinner (we did not).  Courses were served with a nice pace - not too slow, not too fast.  Total dining time was about 1.5 hours, which is about right for me. \n\nEmeril's was not full despite it being the day before new year's eve.  MGM has a LOT of nice restaurants in the casino and Emeril's is surrounded by competition (craft steak house, pearl asian restaurant, etc.).  I hope others give Emeril's a try.  We will definitely go back again."

Since we did not think to make reservations, we had to wait for a table and that wasn't even in the restaurant itself, but the outer part where people can see you when they walk by. Still, we did not mind seeing it was an opportunity of a lifetime to dine at one of Emeril Legasse's restaurants. The seasonal oysters with dipping sauces were great... as are fresh clams if they have them. Those were the highlights! Great sauces too accompanying them. If you prefer your seafood cooked, they have a big selection as well. For those of you who do not like seafood, well, there are things for you too such as chicken, pork chops, steak, but I highly recommend the seafood. There is gumbo as well, but I don't think it was THAT good. It wasn't bad, but not superb."

Because the size of our group we were split off in two tables. It did take a bit to get all the water, bread, and orders in. But that is understandable due to the size of our group.  Their corn bread was ok, a bit on the dry side but they did bring out a a side butter as well. I had the gumbo to start and it was delicious. BBQ salmon was my main course, it had onion rings on top and also diced potatoes and sausage as well. I had the salmon in medium but they usually cool to medium rare.

The soup of the day was butternut squash-- which doesn't sound particularly exciting but i was on a butternut squash kick at the time. Boy was I glad i got it! It was the BEST I've ever had. The reason? Somehow, they managed to incorporate meat into it. I could taste it- i SWEAR i could. But I couldn't actually make it out. I know.. sounds a mysteriously scary, but the best I can figure is that they perhaps minced or blended some pork or beef and brewed it with the soup. In any case, it was PERFECT and i could drink it for days! My bf who is strictly carnivore & cringed when i offered him a taste quickly changed his tune and kept asking for more. I will definitely be back, and this time I will be ready to throw down some heartier meals."

Just delicious!\n\nFor the main course I had the Ribeye. Perfectly cooked steak @ med rare. Good flavor and size. So compared to the Cowboy Ribeye at Beauty and Essex - it beat that one out. Compared to the ribeye I had a Golden Steer and New York that I had at Harvest - Not quite there. But still good nonetheless. The wife had the trout with crab meat. That was really good. I had a side of Jambalaya - which was one of the best I've had since being in New Orleans.\n\nFor dessert we shared a banana cream pie which was on point!\n\nThe ambiance and feel of the restaurant was very nice and the service was very good, as well! \n\nWould I go here again?

Next, had some savory large chunk lobster bisque with a delightful twist of sliced fresh tomatoes and crispy green beans- if this combination sounds strange to you- all I can say is that you need to try it- it works! However, I like my soup hot, so let me suggest that you request it that way as my only criticism is that it was warm.\n\nThe lettuce wedge was refreshing and what I had expected. The main courses were the halibut (fresh) and bar-b-qued salmon. Both were flavorful and cooked to perfection. I had the halibut seared and chose the garlic ponzu sauce- which I highly recommend. My fianc\u00e9e had the salmon and it came with a hash-type side dish- everything on his plate was eaten, enjoyed, with a statement of repeating the order next time come here. \n\nLast, but not least, the dessert! Cappacino lovers- make sure to order it to accompany your dessert, you won't regret it! The rolled chocolate cake has a raspberry filling in the center, the banana cream pie is full of fresh bananas, and the ice cream/sorbet literally melts in your mouth!

They brought out a bowl with 2 tiny pieces of lobster (I guess to prove that there was any) and then drowned them in an overly sweet corn puree... fail\n\nMy shrimp po'boy got sent back, as the shrimp were cold and the bread was rock hard... inedible... big fail.\n\nMy wife had the prosciutto flat bread... overcooked and uninspired... fail.\n\nService was also uninspired... pleasant enough, but my wife was never asked if she wanted a refill on her wine, we were never offered coffee or dessert.\n\nThe high point of the meal was the fact that they offered Pride Viognier by the glass... in fact the only thing this restaurant has going for it is the wine program.\n\nI have had similar poor experiences at Emeril's Delmonico restaurant.  Here is yet another celebrity chef that needs to spend more time at his locations and less time on TV."

Had the corn/lobster bisque which was good, but only two tiny pieces of lobster.  Then had the salmon and that was not good. Chewy and the potato hash it came with was soggy and overcooked. I forgot what my husband's dish was called but he did not enjoy any of it.  Came with mussels, two rubbery shrimp and \"fish medallions\" he couldn't eat.  With so many options at MGM, I would try something else."

First off, the best appetizer on the list is Emeril's BBQ shrimp. The shrimp were tender and prepared with a smoky sweet BBQ sauce. It was so delicious I would recommend this as a must try app. My next favorite app was the blue crab with remoulade. There were large chunks of cold crab meat on a lettuce bed, served with a delicious sauce. The mushroom risotto was not so great. The rice was a bit hard, could have used a few more minutes of cooking.\n\nNext up main courses-  you cannot go wrong with the lobster tail with beurre blanc! The lobster was fresh and tender.  My favorite part of this dish was the mashed potatoes. There were saut\u00e9ed sweet onions mixed in which took them to another level. Another delicious choice was the crab stuffed shrimp. The shrimp were marinated in a Cajun seasoning, served on a bed of succotash. They were not skimpy on the seasoned crabmeat stuffed inside. This is an all-around great place to have an excellent fine dining dinner!"

I was a little ambivalent about our choice since it was a Thursday evening during Spring Break and there was no wait, especially for a big group. \n\nWe ordered tons of food.  We split the crab cakes to start.  I also ordered Emeril's mouth watering, best tasting corn chowder ever!  It was a splendid blend of cheese (which I absolutely love), bacon and corn.  It was a nice size bowl of soup that I could just eat for days straight.  I had a glass of wine which was also to die for, unfortunately I don't remember the name.  \n\nAnd of course if the appetizers and soup are magnificent, one would expect their main course to be a complete bombshell.  Oh was I in for a disappointment, I ordered the Opah with Emeril's own seasoning.  I hate to say it but it was the driest piece of fish that I have ever tasted.  I was immediately disappointed and really just wanted to order another cup of my bacon corn chowder.  I would return purely for the bowl of heavenly soup.  Mmmm mmm...  So I'd say this place was definitely not worth the hype. There are tons of other restaurants in Vegas that are worth the dollar."

For non-sea food, the Pork Chop with Tamarind Sauce was very good.\n\nFor desert, of course the Bananas Rum Foster Bread Pudding is classic and very good.  Two warnings, first, if Creme Brulee is on the menu, avoid it, it is the one item I have had at Emeril's which was not very good; second, while coffee refills were frequent, the coffee was tepid, not hot; we did ask that they make sure the coffee was hot, and the servers did make sure we got hotter coffee from then on.\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant."

The first time we ate here we finally understood why Emeril is always so excited when he's cooking; his food is off the chart in a rich, gluttonously sinful way. I love the steaks here, if youre really lucky they are serving them with buttery lobster mashed potatoes. The BBQ'ed shrimp appetizer is unfortunately small but incredibly delicious, I dare you to not scrape every ounce of sauce off the plate and then wonder if its possible to order just some more sauce. Even though the appetizers and entrees are delicious I do my best to save room for the banana cream pie; its a challenge and I usually fail but luckily we always go at lunch time which gives me plenty of time to recover from a food coma before the nightlife begins. Never having been a banana cream pie, I was hesitant at first, but had absolutely no reason to be. This is a perfect example of really great ingredients coming together in a great way, the graham cracker crumb crust, the shaved chocolate, the caramel drizzle.....I'm getting excited just typing about it, but before I stop I will say, ask for extra caramel, you'll thank me!"

The wine selection was incredibly vast, so our waiter selected two bottles based on the type and price range I typically aim for - they were perfect.\n\nI had a tuna tartar and spinach salad (both very fresh, though the tuna portion was a little on the small side), and for the table, we ordered mac n cheese and mushrooms bourdelaine.

Great restaurants all over town offer a three course meal for 30 40 or $50 to benefit three square.  And we ended our national holiday with emerils. Emerils is located at the MGM Grand in a section called the district. I would've thought it was new but my friend said she had been coming here for years.  So Emeril gets extra points for having a $20 wine pairing. Not all of the restaurant week restaurants do this but Emeril did.  And they did not mind that I refuse to drink sweet wine and had to change out two of the three wines . However there are minus points for making the dessert on the restaurant week menu smaller than the regular dessert.  I started with the gumbo on the recommendation of a friend and it was really good . It was spicy it had a lot of shrimp and sausage . But the real star of the show was the Hawaiian butterfish. It was served exactly the way fish should be served in my opinion without skin and without bones. I am a true stickler on this. It was seared to perfection.  It was served with a spicy sauce but it was also served with an avocado cream sauce that really defies explanation. It was just so good. The fish was served on a bed of pickled veg and also with fresh cucumbers. The contrast was simply amazing.  When I'm in the mood to brave the strip I will definitely be back"

This is probably my favorite place to go for Restaurant Week and here's why:\n\nComes with a 3 course meal for $50.15.  I ordered the shrimp Andouille sausage gumbo, flat iron steak, banana creme pie, and a latte.  Also tried some seared ahi tuna, creole fries, broiled oysters with parmesan, and alligator meatballs for fun.   \n\nWe started off with cornbread and butter.  The cornbread was sweet, and I'm always happy when the butter I get is spreadable (because it doesn't happen often). \n\nTypically for Restaurant Week, venues provide smaller portions of their menu for you to try.  Not this place.  I had a full portion of gumbo to start.  Between the cornbread and gumbo, I thought I wasn't going to have any room for steak or dessert.  Somehow I managed.  :D   Anyways, the gumbo had the perfect amount of salt.  It includes shrimp, okra, rice, and andouille sausage.  Very savory, hearty, and delicious.  \n\nThe seared ahi tuna was drizzled in ponzu sauce and came with a side of creole fries.  \n\nWe also ordered broiled oysters with Parmesan.  It was cooked perfectly.  It was served on a bed of sea salt and red peppercorns, but the oysters were already seasoned enough.  Expensive ($3.50 ea), but it was very good.  \n\nThe alligator meatballs came with a small amount of collard greens.  Interesting flavor.  Wasn't bad.  I think it lacked some flavor.  \n\nWhen I ordered flat iron steak from the Restaurant Week menu, I was expecting small flat iron steak, but nooooo.  This steak was large, thick, and juicy!  It was cooked exactly how I wanted: medium rare.  The steak was drizzled in some red sauce and came with a side of sauteed onions, a couple of cloves of garlic, and fried mushrooms.  I wasn't a fan of the fried mushrooms, but the steak was very tender and juicy.  I only had room for half the steak.  \n\nLast, I got the banana creme pie.  OMG, this is probably my favorite dessert....right next to creme brulee!  Come to think of it, I think this banana creme pie outranks creme brulee in my book.  I inhaled it.  \n\nAlso finished with a latte.  They serve my favorite coffee brand: Illy.  Came in a cute cup that had the perfect portion of latte.  It was also served a little warmer than room temperature, but that's how I like my coffee/lattes anyway.  \n\nOverall, I had a great Restaurant Week experience here.  All the items in the Restaurant Week menu are also available on the regular menu.  It was awesome that they served them in full sized portions.  I am definitely a fan of Emeril's!"

I wish there was more than four on the plate, because i wanted to keep eating.\n\nFor the entree, my friend and I shared two dishes.  We got the BBQ Salmon and the Pan-Roasted Gulf Flounder.  Both were very well cooked.  The salmon had bolder flavors, while the flounder was milder in flavor, but had a richer sauce.  It was almost too rich for me.  We also order a side of the Asparagus and Roasted Paquillo Peppers with Goat Cheese, which was perfectly cooked.\n\nWhile I enjoyed all the things we order, none of it really stood out to me as super spectacular.  I guess I had high expectations for Emeril Lagasse to wow me, and he sort of didn't.

The decor is nice but unmoving with no view to the outdoors. The restaurant also lacks its own restrooms, so you have to use the casino's facilities located down the corridor--try explaining to your party why it took you so long to get back from the restroom...\n\nAs for the food, it is way over seasoned, be it the crab cakes, the Texan Redfish, the gumbo or the pork chops. The quality of the ingredients was also questionable. The pork chops were poor cuts, completely fatty, and cooked poorly (burnt on the outside and rare on the inside). \n\nFinally, this seemingly fancy restaurant is without a sommelier, although it boasts a comprehensive wine selection.  Our server recommended a white wine (as most of the dining party had fish) which was more of a desert wine that did not compliment any of the dishes.  With the food being salty, the wine tasted even sweeter. \n\nIn the end, great company, not the restaurant, made the dining enjoyable."

Everything came out really well it reminded me of McCormick and Schmicks. It was cooked to perfection. Also tried the Gumbo and it was spicy and good but I think the clam chowder is much better. They also make a great bloody mary, the spice was good but they came in short glasses."

That brings me to Emeril's.\n\nThe design of the restaurant serves to draw you in. It's sleek, chic and modern. I loved that. The bar is large enough that there most likely isn't much waiting for a seat. I really appreciate that. \n\nWhen I was there it was empty-ish. There were a few people around the bar, but no huge crowds. That is why I was perplexed that the service was slow. The bartenders seem well meaning, but somewhat loopy. I don't know why. Carbon monoxide leak? I was fine. Anyway. \n\nI ordered the oysters off the bar menu. It was that time right between lunch and dinner so I didn't want to stuff myself. They had the oysters at $1.25/pop. Let me tell you something. I may loathe the strip, but I would crawl across glass to get to these oysters. They were JUST the right size. The kind that you bite into and they aren't too big that you want to hurl, but not too small that you don't even realize you have them in your mouth. It was a Goldilocks moment, for sure. JUST RIGHT. The only issue I had was that they mixed so much horseradish in that my nose was on fire. I am a huge fan of spicy and hot, but not in my cocktail sauce, thank you. I swear I think I smoked the oysters with the fire from my nostrils. I asked for more sauce and they brought me out a huge bowl (overkill) and all was right with the world.\n\nI also ordered rock shrimp on a piece of lame lettuce. It sounded so enticing and then I got it. Nope. I'm a fan of shrimp, I'm a fan of creole shrimp, but I am not a fan of this shrimp. It tasted almost frozen then fried. It was really something I'd expect from a mall food court, seriously. And they had it piled on this lettuce that, on the menu, sounded so good. I was so visually let down that I felt like pushing it away and asking for the REAL rock shrimp. No bueno. \n\nSo, I love that they carry two kinds of Chimay (blue and red), but I dislike the $13 price tag when everyone else on the strip charges $12, but I do love the oysters! I can imagine I'll try this place again because, hey, oysters."

            "review": "We had a great meal at Emeril's. We let them know when we made our reservation that we wanted the chef to prepare a tasting menu for us. This was the fourth or fifth time we've done this and it is just a wonderful experience. As with any of the celebrity chef chain restaurants, the chefs normally need to follow the formula set out for them. By asking for the tasting menu, I think the chef gets the opportunity to be creative and in this case, James Richards ran with it. We also opted for a wine pairing and our sommelier, Scott McSimov, was great.\n\nWe started with a glass of Roederer champagne accompanied by oysters two ways - first chilled with a raspberry granita, lovely greens with a lemony dressing, followed by an oyster shooter which was slightly warm in a cream, bacon and tarragon sauce. The shooter was a standout for the evening.\n\nWe then progressed to a light white and I did not keep good track of the wines. We had a lake fish from Iowa accompanied by ramps in an onion vinegar dressing with a few roasted potatoes. It was very tasty, light and delicious.\n\nThe next course was a lovely perfectly cooked risotto with fresh peas and seared scallops. This was finished with manchego cheese and a dash of chardonnay vinegar to bring out the flavor of the wine pairing for this course.\n\nThe next course was a take on smoked salmon. It was salmon roasted on a cedar plank with some chopped egg and roasted tomatoes. I'm not a great fan of smokey flavors but the chef should get an A for effort and creativity. This was paired with a Pinot which worked well with the bolder flavor.\n\nThe final savory course was very unusually prepared using what I think was the Modernist technique. The ribeye was frozen solid, then seared with a blow torch (if I remember correctly), then cooked for hours. I think the intent is that it becomes very tender and remains rare throughout without the gray edge. This was paired with morels, mashed potatoes and a generous amount of very tasty foie gras. The accompanying full-bodied wine from Spain was a good match - Numanthia Termes. The steak was not as tender as I expected, but was very tasty.\n\nWe ended with a lovely dessert wine - Kracher from Austria - the famous banana cream pie and a turtle cheesecake.\n\nAll of the portions were very generous and we could really only have a bite or two of dessert.\n\nDuring dinner, we learned that there is a kitchen table where we can also have this experience. We may opt for that if there are more than two of us, but our corner booth was very comfortable and we consider this a not-to-be-missed dinner each time we visit Vegas. We finished the evening with a tour of the kitchen and an invitation to return at lunch the next day for the famous Po-Boy. We were in a food coma and passed on this, regretfully. The dinner was $90pp with $55pp for the wine pairing."

Without reservations, my party of 3 was seated instantly on an uneventful Tuesday night.\n\nMy dinner menu consisted of: Marinated Mozzarella & Serrano Ham, Gumbo, Warm Spinach and Lobster Salad, and Emeril's Banana Creme Pie.  First of all, cheese and ham is just cheese and ham.  Therefore my only comment on the Marinated Mozzarella & Serrano Ham is \"absurd!\"  The gumbo was good, but not great.  Actually, I think plain old Gumbo is too dull for Emeril's fancy menu.  My favorite dish was the \"salad\" because it wasn't really a salad.  It was a big fat piece of lobster meat that had warm spinach as a side.  YUMMY!  Then waiter's recommended Banana Creme Pie was a pleasant way to end the meal but it wasn't better than an ordinary Marie Callenders pie.  \n\nThis posh restaurant was placed in the right spot of MGM grand. \nThe concept of the decor was dimly complex that it boggle me on why he would portray New Orleans like this.  \n\nAll I have to say is Go Saints!  Next time I want to experience New Orleans, I better go to Louisana because Emeril failed to bring it to Vegas."

What was served was anything but. Dont know if they ran out or it was half baked, what we got was soggy and pasty -no where near what we have had before.

It's pricey, ~$150/person with the wine but well worth it!.  On my most recent trip to Emeril's, my boyfriend and I were celebrating my birthday and our chef tasting menu was as follows:\n\n1st couse - Stone Crab Claw Salad with shaved apples, honey-glazed marcona almonds and butter lettuce topped with machengo cheese - this was one of our favorite courses, the crab was so fresh!  Paired wine was a nice, dry champagne from France\n\n2nd course - Lobster Pappardelle Pasta with fresh mushrooms - so rich and delicious, I shouldn't have eaten so much and saved more room for later!  Paired wine was Pinot Grigio, cut through the richness of the pasta very nicely\n\n3rd course - Pan-Roasted Black Bass in basil pesto with a Sicilian capitone sauce and crispy pancetta - loved this dish too!  Paired wine was a white blend of viognier, grenache, marsanne and rousanne from Paso Robles, this was divine\n\n4th course - Cornmeal-crusted fried quail and corn hash, our least favorite, a bit too gamey for us. But the paired wine was Pinor Noir, my favorite, yum :)\n\n5th course - Cedar Plank Campfire Rib-Eye with with Louisiana-style shrimp etouffee and an andouille pork sausage - this was SO good but I was so full by this point that I couldn't finish.  All 3 components were awesome and the etouffee sauce on the rib-eye was excellent!  Paired wine was Cab Sav, so full-bodied and luscious\n\n6th course - New Orleans-style bread and butter bread pudding - to die for!  I was so full but this tasted so good I had to finish it.  Paired wine was Moscato di Asti, not too sweet and the bubbles were quite lovely\n\nThe service is impeccable.  We had two waiters who both new the food and wine backwards and forwards!\n\nIf you're in Vegas and want to spend some dough on dinner, head over to the MGM Grand, Emeril's does not disappoint!"

We went to the hostess to acquired a table for a party of 4 and we were told that they need a moment to set up the table. I peaked in the restaurant thinking, ok, there is a party leaving so that is where we are going to sit. About almost 10 minutes later, we are still standing there, I was still looking at that table, and it was still not cleaned up!! So I was telling my husband that they are SO slow in cleaning up....and setting up table..I will put it in my yelp review! The hostess must have heard me saying it because she came over and said, just 10 more minutes and your table will be ready. So approximately 10 min later, we were taken to the table that was further into the restaurant next to the bar and not the one that I was staring at...the first thing i think is, why on earth you need 20 min to set up a table that is already there??!!  \n\nSo the first thing was, we sat down and was given the menu from our guy and told us the water will come shortly. Guess what. The water never came. About 5-10 min later, the guy appear to take our water. One of us told him that we never got our water so he apologized and got some. So we order two chicken po-boy combo with gumbo and clam chowder and the desserts were banana cream pie and bourbon bread pudding.\n\nThe gumbo and chowder came pretty fast (that is about 10-15min after ordering). I didn't understand why would any one pour the hot gumbo into a cold plate right in front of us...the gumbo just became lukewarm and it is really a disappointment. So here comes the long long wait for our po-boy. We sat there for almost 45 minutes to a point where we were about to leave...We asked our guy about when the food is coming and he replied it will be soon. We also instructed that we would like the dessert to come at the same time because I really don't want to wait for another 30 min for a piece of dessert. So in between the waiting, I have observed something that is very interesting. So the bus boys bring the food to the kitchen and leave it on one of those \"temporary station\"!!! Then the waiters will then go and look at the food and try to figure out who is getting what! The end result is: everyone looks very confused!!! I really have never seen that...I don't think that would work well if it was a full night at all.\n\nAfter a while, the lo-boy finally arrived. I knew it was a combo so it would be smaller in size...but it was absolutely tasteless!!!! It was suppose to be some spiced up chicken!!!! There was barely any SALT on it AT all...that is the same on the fries. It was suppose to be \"cajun\" fries...and only the bottom ones have some kind of salt and cajun taste to it!! Totally disappointing!!! So we asked for the dessert to come at the same time right? It did not come!!!! But I did saw two banana pie sitting on that temporary station for the entire duration while we are eating our po-boy!! Finally, as we are finishing, I asked our guy politely about our dessert, then he went and fetch that banana pie that was sitting there and said, \"oh, the kitchen brought two banana pie so you will have to wait for your bread pudding.\" I was a bit pissed by that point because you need 15 min or so to make a bread pudding??!! So finally we finished the po-boy and the bread pudding arrived. That is a part where I was a bit pissed. I understand he has got his both hand full, one with my dish and another dish in the other hand. He put down my pudding and told me....I will come back for the plate...let me say, the plate was big and the table was small. So I was sitting there crammed between the plates and waiting for him to remove it....I saw him walking back and forth at least twice behind me with EMPTY hands....man...COME ON!!! You could not have taken my empty plate and put it on your temporary station??? So my bourbon pudding.....where is the bourbon??!!! Totally again a huge disappointment!!! No taste at all! not even really sweet?!\n\nSo in all, we spend over 2 hours here leaving with feelings of unsatisfied in service and food and I will NEVER recommend any ONE to dine here!!!"

I was somewhat disappointed... there was really nothing all that memorable about this meal.  Everything was mediocre to slightly better than average... that goes for not only the food, but also the decor and the service.  The best item we ordered was the steak, though \"medium\" was more close to \"rare\", which came with a big side of some of the creamiest mashed potatoes I've had.  Beware that most of the items on the menu are quite heavy.  The spicy seafood pasta dish was a slightly more sophisticated version of a jambalaya but it did have a nice flavor to it with a good little kick.  The most disappointing dish at this \"Fish House\" was the grouper we ordered.  The fish was overcooked and dry and if it weren't for the cream sauce they drenched the fish in, it really had very little taste.  The apple cobbler dessert was also a disappointment, maybe it would've tasted a bit better if it had been served warm.  Like most of the dishes we ordered, I got sick of this after a few bites.\n\nFor the price you'll be paying, you're best off going to many other better restaurants in Las Vegas.  \n\nAnd please, I plead everyone out there, let's stop with the use of \"bam\".  Our cute waiter was fine up until that point."

            "review": "Something fishy at Emeril's...\n\nI came here for dinner with a party of four a few months ago.\n\nOur meals were all pricey and were not really that great.  We got the calamari and the scallops for the appetizer.  Both of which were OK, but not that great.  For the entree, we had the salmon, steak, chicken, and pork chops.  I had the salmon and did not really care for the overpowering and almost offensive barbeque sauce it was covered in.  The other entrees were described as just \"OK\" and \"I've had better\". \n\nThe real trouble began when we got our bill.  The other couple my wife and I were dining with had cash and I had a credit card.  To make things easier, I asked the waitress to apply the cash to our bill and put the rest on my credit card.  Not that difficult of a request.  If my local diner can accomplish this task, why not a fancy Vegas restaurant.  I don't have the exact amounts in front of me, but let's say the bill came out to $300 and my dining partners contributed a $100 dollar bill.  The amount that should have been left over for the credit card is $200.  Well, the bill comes back to the table (dropped off by someone else this time) and it is a credit card receipt for $220.  Since when does $300 minus $100 equal $220?  We called the guy over who dropped off the bill and explained everything to him and he claims to have no idea what is going on and leaves to go get our waitress.  After a bit of a wait, she comes over and we explain everything to her.  She claims the bill is correct.  After explaining basic mathematics to her and her still saying the bill is correct we then ask to please see our original bill that was dropped off at our table a few minutes ago so that we can show more clearly that $300 minus $100 does not equal $220.  She says she can't do that because their computer system won't allow it.  WTF?!  We then say OK if the computer won't allow it, don't reprint it, just bring it to us since it was here just a minute ago.  She then says they don't keep the receipts.  Do they burn them upon payment?  What the hell is she talking about they don't keep the receipts from 10 minutes ago?  We then get pissed off and demand to know what happened to the receipt.  \"It must still be in the restaurant somewhere\", we tell her.  The waitress, now very annoyed and red-faced, says she will be back.  We waited for about 10 minutes as she and the guy who had dropped off the check were huddled around a computer screen.  The restaurant was closing at this point and we were the last customers left.  The waitress and waiter disappear into the back for another few minutes and then she comes out and rudely slaps down a waded up piece of paper which was our itemized receipt that was supposedly no longer available for us to see.  We then went through the whole math equation again with her and wanted to know where the extra $20 charge came from.  She then told a story about how their computer system automatically splits bills that way if you apply cash to a credit card payment.  We then say, \"so you overcharge every customer who pays this way by $20 because of a computer glitch?\".  Her story rambled on and on and never really made any sense.  She finally, rudely, brought us an adjusted bill after spending another 10 minutes at the computer.  Just to make sure, we pulled out the calculator and added it all up again and it was still overcharging us by about two dollars.  We did not really care about this small sum of money, but my wife pointed it out and wanted to know why we just can't get the proper amount to show on the bill.  The waitress then snaps at us and says \"If you really want the two dollars I'll give it to you, is that what you want!\"  We then just say \"No, we don't care about a couple dollars. We just want to know why it is so difficult to just charge us for the proper amount.  Why do you keep overcharging us.  It's just the point, whether it's $2 or $20\".  We then sign our receipt and she snatches it up.  When we finally left the restaurant, some of the workers were standing around giving us dirty looks like we had inconvenienced them or something.  Not sure if we were trying to be ripped off or if the whole rambling computer splitting bills that way story is true or not.  Either way, we would have given them an extra $20 had we not caught it.  I wonder if this is a common occurrence at the ol' Fish House and if this has happened to others without them knowing??? \n\nBased on the overpriced food that is not very good, the very rude and almost hostile service we received, and the very questionable billing situation we encountered, I will have to put this up there as one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.\n\nFish House....You Stink!"

I was not a member of Yelp during my vacation to Las Vegas 5 months ago, but my visit here is still fresh in my mind! When my boyfriend and I first arrived in Vegas, Emeril's was the place we wanted to go for lunch, after hearing about it on the Food Network. It wasn't very busy, so we got seated quickly with a view of the casino mall. My first desire was to try the infamous banana cream pie. But we thought we had better eat something substantial first, then dessert afterward. I started out with a fresh green salad and bowl of seafood gumbo that was perfectly seasoned! The bread basket contained hot, homemade assortments of breads & rolls. That was hard not to keep eating it all! Finally, the time came for the grand finale! Already, I was getting full, but I just HAD to at least split the banana cream pie with my boyfriend. Our waiter was wonderful and kept doting on us throughout our meal. We were feeling very special as he talked us into trying their famous bread pudding with whiskey sauce, along with the pie. So we split both desserts and thought we were in heaven! Then soon after, the waiter brought us samples of more desserts on the house. He wanted us to try their different flavors of sorbets. Other diners were looking at us like we were gluttons for dessert! Everything tasted outstanding! We finally waddled out of the restaurant so full, that we needed to get to our room for a period of rest & digestion. Too bad our friends who were supposed to meet us there, missed their plane! They really missed out on this memorable dining experience!"

The circular bar is at the entrance of the restaurant and the bar staff was pretty friendly.  I arrived early at around 7pm and the restaurant looked about half empty so I was a little confused to why a 7pm reservation wasn't available.. weird.  The decor was nice but you could get away with jeans and a polo; the two walls enclosing the restaurant were lined with bottles of wine.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the Calamari and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp.  The calamari was tender and crispy, but nothing spectacular.  The BBQ shrimp were wild blue shrimp-- again, very tender and the BBQ sauce wasn't too heavy. \n\nhttp://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H5u097W2ywgDx5evASoyRQ/l.jpg\n\nhttp://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WLv7aTEh8wDr6vfY_AlvjQ/l.jpg\n\nI knew I would order a fish entree since this is a fish house, and I freaking love fish! \n\nI was torn between the pan roasted sea bass, the whole grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass, and the whole grilled American Black Bass.  Our waiter Gus was really helpful and suggested the whole grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass.  The two Bass's were market price, so I knew they would both be pretty fresh.  \n\nI was pretty shocked when the fish came out because it was a lot bigger than I had anticipated-- the bass barely fit on my plate and it literally was the whole fish!  The grilled/charred criss-crossed skin looked great (I love charr!) and the bass was Citrus and Herb stuffed with Chardonnay Agrodulce.  The whole fish was perfectly cooked-- very juicy and flakey!  The best part were the cheeks, charred skin, and the belly (i love the fatty part).  I ate it all.\n\nhttp://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WAbM_0y6h2Q8OLy3BKLiLQ/l.jpg\n\nThe Wine menu was huge compared to the food menu so we had to ask the sommelier to help us out.  Our table ordered all different entrees: fish, etouffee, and steak, so he suggested we go with a Pinot Noir.  We ordered a bottle of the 2010 A.P Vin.  I was surprised that the wine wasn't corked; it was a screw top which I thought was odd.  The wine was pretty fruity and paired nicely with our entrees. \n\nFor Dessert, I had the Banana Cream Pie.  YUM!  I love how they use whole slices of banana instead of mashing the banana in with the filling.  The pie was garnished with caramel sauce and chocolate shavings.  The ratio of the pie was 50% banana, 50% cream, so I didn't feel too guilty about polishing it off. \n\nhttp://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dE08svm378CZOkRgk-Q5Fg/l.jpg\n\nI tried some of my co worker's Frozen Key Lime Mousse Pie.  If you like tart, you will love this!  The creamy part of the pie and the coconut cookies mellows out the tartness of the frozen lime.  It also comes with a Mandarin orange coulis(a pureed sauce) which helped balance out the sweet and sour-ness of the pie. \n\nhttp://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lLCza292bSMRstYxdqdt8Q/l.jpg\n\nI'm definitely coming back here to try the other seafood dishes!"

The seafood platter was quite small and was almost $60. \n\n **** If your in Vegas this is definitely a must go. You will enjoy it! Some of the best service i ever received!\n\n9-27-12"

As we sat down at our table, the hostess set our linen cloths on our laps for us.. Cool! I thought that was awesome! \n\nOur waitress was very kind and attentive and she answered all our questions. She was also quite informative about all the small details such as ingredients and what tastes best, and most importantly, she was very knowledgeable on the menu. I did not catch her name, but she had layered, brown hair with side bangs. Terrific service!\n\nThe basket of bread was to die for -- I ate probably around 5 rolls before my main dish. So, so, so good! \n\nI ordered the shrimp creole. It contained a plentiful amount of shrimp along with grits (amazing!!), beans, and a delicious tomato sauce. I loved what I ordered and savored every last bite.\n\nMy brother and mom enjoyed their meals too. Sadly, the three of us were too stuffed to order dessert, as I'm sure Emeril's dessert menu is to die for. Had I gotten dessert, I most likely would have given this restaurant the full, five stars.\n\nWe will be returning to this restaurant the next time we are in town."

Very good.\n*   Cream of mushroom soup.  Sister-in-law says it was delicious.\n*   Barbecue shrimp.  A signature dish.  Brother says it was very good.\n*   Grilled hebi (spearfish).  Medium to large filet, thick, grilled, with chive olive oil.  Served on a bed of potato pieces, orange, and onions.  Very good; brother also had this dish, and agrees.\n*   Pecan crusted Texas redfish:  SIL says \"very good.\"\n*   Banana cream pie with banana crust, chocolate shavings, and caramel sauce.  Tall wedge of pie.  Very dense, rich banana cream with pieces of banana.  Thick layer of good whipped cream.  All three of us thought it was excellent (and I'm not very fond of banana cream pie).\n\nMy brother has been to Emeril's before, and thinks very highly of the place.  I liked it a lot, but nothing knocked my socks off.  Still, it is one of the better restaurants I've tried - much better than I would have expected from a restaurant empire.  I may not return for a meal, but I'll be back for a piece of that banana cream pie!"

There's nothing traditional barbeque about these shrimp, there's just 3 shrimp sitting on a plate that have been cooked in the most flavorful reduced sauce ever. Save the rolls that are put on the table until the shrimp arrive so that you can mop up the sauce. You also can't go wrong with the Fried Oysters with Old Fashioned Remoulade and Apple Smoked Bacon Bibb Lettuce Tossed in Apple Cider Dressing and Cornbread Croutons. The oysters were cooked perfectly and loved the remoulade sauce with them. I did wish the oysters breading had a little more crunch and the cornbread croutons were a little less dry but I'd order this again.\n\nThe only disappointment, but it didn't keep me from eating them, were the Beignets with Powdered Sugar and Coffee Ice Cream. The beignets were not quite up to Caf\u00e9 du Monde status. My suggestion if you do need your beignets fix is to tear it in half and spoon the coffee ice cream into it."

The very good waiter suggested that the Salmon should be medium rare (just the way I like it).  What I got was cold fried potato chunks with cold dry sausage chunks underneath an over cooked salmon.  The so-called homemade Worcestershire sauce didn't appear to  be anywhere.  A sweet, unpleasant barbecue sauce was scattered around the plate.  To top it off, the \"onion crust\" was cold, soggy onion strings.  I don't know how all of the items that need to be fresh off the grill could be so cold and soggy while the Salmon was over cooked.  Yuck!  At least the Willamette valley Pinot Noir was excellent.\n\nMy wife had one of the worst crab cakes that she has ever had to go along a very boring salad.\n\nWe won't be back."

With many choices I decided on Emeril's. What a mistake.\n\nWhen dinning alone, I prefer to eat at the bar. I have found throughout my travels that if good food and service is provided at the bar you've truly found an outstanding establishment, or in this case, not.\n\nFirst off, I wasn't offered a wine list. With a very large wine room they don't have a sommelier. When I asked the bartender to pair wines with my meal all he could do was ask \"do you want white or red?\"\n\nI started with crab cakes which were so over seasoned that I couldn't tell if it was crab or white fish. Next was Gumbo. That is good but I think the shrimp had been frozen. Main course was Blacken Wild Sea Bass that was over cook served with a vegetable melody swimming in worchestier sauce. I wasn't offered a dessert menu.  \n\nAny other restaurant would ask if there was a problem when they clear the plate away and find most of the food had not been eaten. Not here as they just don't care. $85 later and I left The Strip vowing never to return again."

No comparison to Robuchen's or Rick Moonen's RM seafood or even Shibuya or Wolfgang's.  I had better food at the fish and chip stand in NYNY.\n\nThe crab trio tasting was less than memorable.  The king crab was ok, the rest meh.\nThe oysters had so many loose shell shards in them, and they didn't give us any utensil to serve the condiments.\n\nWe are from boston, so maybe we are a little spoiled by proper lobster bisque.  But what we got was salty and less than tasteful.  It was made edible only after we asked for some cream fraiche.\n\nThe only thing that was somewhat decent was the grilled whole fish wife got, even if it was a bit overcooked.  My own entree was so unmemorable, I can't even remember what I had now.\n\nOh definitely skip the Creme Brulee or rather egg custard, we left ours after one spoon.\n\nThe service was terrible, from the hostesses to the waiter, felt like we were in a road side diner (actually that maybe an insult to some of the diners we had visited that had awesome and attentive service).  Amateur night is how I would describe it.\n\nWe had ordered a bottle of sparkling, which the server took away and did not bother to return and refill until end of our meal.\n\nWe had a show to rush to and when the waiter came to drop off the bill we even discussed it and he watched me put my card on the table.

I am a music person from Nashville and was in for the Country Music Awards show and the Film Production conference with a bunch of folks from Hollywood. We are well used to $125 plate meals. This is a $36-$40 a plate restaurant and it did not carry Emeril's inviting, warm personality to it at all.  You never know who you are seating so you should always make your guests feel warm and welcomed. This place felt hostile.  The service was so over the top. The staff was dictating our meal service by taking our plates away before we were done and did not listen when we asked them not to take plates away. Our utensils were in the correct positioning to convey this message. The staff really work hard here, but it was like they felt they were under a microscope. We won't be going back there because of the staff.\n\nThe guy that took our orders and checked on our table seemed annoyed with us for ordering water as we were dehydrated from traveling.

I kind of stared all around looking for a waiter.  Ok fine, you may be busy, but give us something when we sit so we don't twiddle our thumbs... We had a show to catch and wanted to make sure we had time to enjoy the dinner.\n\nAnywho, looked through the menu and I decided to get something off the dinner menu and the bf wanted to have the tasting menu. Sounds good yea? No. we can't do that.  The waiter came by and said we both had to do the tasting menu so the timing of the food would be the same.... Ok.... you couldn't have told us when you handed us the menus? Thanks! Let's spend another few minutes choosing. Well, since we weren't going to be in LV that often, we decided to spurge and both do the petite tasting menu for $65. Not bad for  4 courses. But I wasn't really digging the choices. \n\nMixed greens with crab meat in soy vinaigrette - Really soy sauce? not the flavors I was hoping for. Wasn't bad tho, tasty and sweet.\n\nSeared Salmon with potatoes and sausage - Nothing special, not memorable at all, but tasted ok. How unmemorable? Well, as I was waiting for my 3rd course to be RECOOKED, I could not recall this dish...\n\nPork tenterloin with cheesey mash potatoes -  Ok to be fair I wasn't looking forward to this dish because I already had an Awesome pork tenderloin the night before at Mesa Grill, so expectations may have been set a bit high... but my god I wasn't expecting this. Since we both had the same dish, you'd expect them to be executed the same. Nope, never assume. \nI first took a bite of the mash potatoes and noticed it was cool, so I touched the plate but it was kinda luke warm. The pork sauce was cold. The meat was more on the rare side of medium rare, tho I asked for medium. Who cooks pork rare? Do I look like I wanna take a gamble for a tapeworm?  The bf's was medium so I had a piece of his. Flavors were decent, but once again nothing special. Back to my rare piggie... \nWe called for a waiter who asked what's wrong. I told him my pork was raw and he called another waitress to help. She asked if it was ok if she brought out another one. So I agreed and they took my raw one away. Lo and behold I get my 3 but pieces back.  Are they suppose to recook the same pieces?  At least the mash potatoes were warm this time. I actually didn't know there was cheese in it the first time since it was so cold, the cheese wasn't stringy. Took 2 bits and called it quits. It was still a little too pink for me.\n\nBy now I really just wanted to leave, but we still had dessert. They had apple strudel listed. Confused, but hoped for the best because for a restaurant of this caliber if they have something this simple, it must be good! Once again, do not assume... (I don't gamble, this is why: I suck at it)\n\nApple strudel with ice cream- Strudel was pale white, ice cold, chewy, doughy and just plain uncooked.  The plating of the items was also not centered.  (Please see picture) What a lovely way to end the evening. \n\nIf you are coming here, I do not recommend the tasting menu. \n\nThere was one thing I did like tho, the dinner roll. It was light, fluffy and fresh. I recommend that. I had 2."

(about $40 per entr\u00e9e.)\n\nWe arrived at 8:30pm and there barely was a wait.  The greeter was courteous.  When we first sat down, they promptly took our cocktail order and told us that water and bread would follow.  \n\nThe good:  I had just ordered the same cocktail for dinner the night before at the Voo Doo Lounge.  The one at the other place was nothing to write home about, even though it was the same exact cocktail.  I don't know what they did differently, but the one I had here was truly spectacular.  I'd give it a 10.  I ordered a dirty martini using Grey Goose vodka.\n\nThe place was nicely decorated, on the main traffic isle to the concert arena (good for people watching), and was clean.\n\nThe bad:  They came around with bread, and you get just one piece of bread, the size of a garlic knot (not very big).  One of my dinner companions was very hungry and after asking, they finally came around with a plate full of bread, but the visual just served just as a tease.  She thought he was just gonna leave the whole plate.  Instead, he gave her just one, and moved on to other tables to pass out the other rolls and acted like it was the last bread on earth and he could only spare just one.\n\nThe wait for dinner was very long.  I didn't time it but I'm gonna guess to say it was 45 minutes.  I realize the kitchen might be backed up or something, but our waiter never came by to say he knew we were alive and we were up in 2 more tables (or whatever).  There was plenty of staff, in fact, they told us they were fully staffed that night gearing up for the exiting crowd (not until 11pm) from that night's AC/DC concert.  We were there during a non-busy time, as the restaurant was only about 75% to capacity and virtually no wait.\nFor a $40 entr\u00e9e, I want my waiter to be on top of things and attentive.  Not only did we have a waiter, but we had a waiter's helper/busboy who came by with water refills and the like.  There really was no excuse I could think of to ignore us that long.\n\nI had heard that the food here was so amazing that I simply couldn't wait to try it.  I ordered the Grilled Hawaiian Swordfish.  It was overcooked, very dry, and there was nothing special about it.  To me, the mark of good food is food combinations, seasoning, and the sauce.  Anyone can make fish, chicken, and steak.  It's what you pair it with and the sauce that floats my boat.  Anyway, there were no such good comments I could make.  There was no sauce or special flavors and the food pairings were nothing unusual.  How about you put together some Cajun seasonings or regional Louisiana cooking, for Pete's Sake?  I felt like I could have had the same fish for $10 at a local diner.  It was plain Jane and dried out.\n\nIt came with Coucous.  The coucous was very good, but hey, it's coucous.  Who can get excited about coucous?  It's like saying you got excited about rice.\n\nThe vegetable was asparagus.  I guess they put it on the grill as well.  It was so overdone that it brought back scary memories of my mom's generation when they used to boil vegetables to death.  It was completely wilted and also had no flavor or distinctive seasoning.  If you're gonna wilt it, then use some spices to rev up our palates.  If you're gonna make it plain, then serve it somewhat al dente so we can at least get in all our nutrients.\n\nI ordered the Beignets.  The last time I was in New Orleans, I am ashamed to admit, I bypassed breakfast and instead ate beignets every day for breakfast along with my robust French coffee.  Those beignets made a lifetime lasting impression on me.  While La Gasse's beignets were edible, they weren't light and fluffy and were certainly forgettable.\n\nI'm giving the restaurant a poor score for non-existent service (when they clearly weren't busy) and a meal that was no better than Denny's.\nDT"

            "review": "NOT A FAN.  I only refrained from giving one-star because the Ahi Tuna is probably one of the prettiest dishes I've seen (take a look at my pic NOW haha)\n\nLuckily I didn't go in super high expectations, but I can't imagine this standing up to many of the other restaurants within 20 feet walking distance.  We ordered the Crusted Ahi Tuna and the Pecan Crusted Redfish.  Appearance was awesome!  The Ahi Tuna's taste was alright, and I just didn't enjoy the Redfish.  I understand that tastes/types of food differ and this many not have been the spot for me, but my complaints come from the service.\n\nProblem number one is that we had two waiters through the night, which is already confusing.  Maybe they got their game plan confused:  They each asked us \"how we were doing\" once during dinner.  They asked within a minute of each other, immediately after we received food and before we started eating.  Awesome.\n\nProblem number two is possibly related to how young I look (or maybe I'm looking into it too much).  The waiter dropped off the menu when he seated us.  After our meal he didn't ask if we wanted dessert and dropped off our check.  Now, this normally wouldn't bother me too much.  I started getting pissed when our same waiter (the one that gave us our menu) seated an older couple right next to us.  He proceeded to give a detailed explanation of their specialty dishes, recommendations, as well as explaining the option of a pricey prix-fixe tasting menu.  I'm not saying I would have ordered differently if I did get the speel, but still....give it regardless!  Also, I was peeking around at all the desserts passing by -drool-...but not like we had the opportunity to order anyways.\n\nI felt pretty neglected (we all just need some love right?) especially for a restaurant that wasn't even half-full.  It's one of the only instances that I've walked out and complained directly to the host.  He seemed very sincere which was nice...but didn't offer for us to give them another chance, if you know what i mean ;)"

Not gonna happen.\n\nThe food is excellent -- yet not even the best food in the world can compensate for service that I can only describe as wretched. I've been here five times. Two times (including tonight) I've had to walk out without ordering anything at all after being ignored by the servers at the counter. \n\nHere's the deal. The people who work at the counter/bar absolutely despise their jobs. I've never seen such resentment and contempt toward customers in my life. Plenty of restaurants have bad service. Nothing earth-shattering about that. But believe me, no restaurant employee in my forty years of dining has come close to matching the level of visible disgust that oozes from the Emeril's counter staff. You can see it in their eyes. You can feel it when they speak to you. They don't want to be there, they don't want YOU to be there, and they'll do whatever it takes to avoid serving you. The only thing they do with any degree of consistency is speak to each other in Spanish about how much they hate working there.\n\nI want to make one thing clear. This review only applies to the counter/bar staff. Perhaps the wait staff in the main dining areas aren't so full of bile and resentment, and if so, that's great.\n\nIf I could give the management one piece of advice it would be this: Fire the counter staff immediately. All of them. Replace them with trained personnel that know how to interact with customers without copping such a horrible attitude. Keeping these bad apples around is going to create a toxic environment for both your employees and customers.\n\n***\n\nUPDATE [7/25/12]: I waited three months and then returned to see if Emeril's had gotten their act together. They hadn't. The management hasn't made a single change. The counter/bar staff are still as inattentive and bitter as ever. This is without a doubt the worst dining establishment I've ever encountered.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague. If for some reason you truly feel compelled to dine here, your best bet is to avoid the counter/bar area, sit at a table, cross your fingers, and hope for the best. Good luck."

The soup was creamy with chunks of sausage, but it must not have been that phenomenal or putrid, because I don't remember what it tasted like.\n\nI move on to order the crab cakes... I figure this is a famous dude's New Orleans kitchen, so the crab cakes would be sublime.... I was SO WRONG.  They were so fishy, I could not finish them.  To give you some insight, I cannot tolerate even the fishiest of an aftertaste..... salmon is out, sea bass, as is red snapper... pretty much EVERYTHING except for tuna (albacore), shrimp, and crab.  I loathe that pungent seafood taste with all of my being... maybe I was a fish in my past life??  Anyhow, crab is usually very tolerable to me, but this just grossed me out.  I felt like I was eating the dirtiest part of the ocean out, and she hadn't showered for a week.\n\nUgh.  Well, you see the four stars... you want to know why?

In fact, my cousin was right.... this is this restaurant's Saving Grace.

Many MGM dining does not open until 5:30.... this restaurant was a few it was open when we get there.  We looked their menu at the front desk and it was what I like.  After we were seated, we realized the menu we saw at the front desk was a happy hour menu.  So we moved to the bar area, grab one of a bar table it was available without any napkins and utensils. When a server (female) came, I asked her we want to order from a happy hour menu and she said okay and gave us a happy hour menu.  Later, a different server (male) came and took our orders.  I was pointed at couple of items from the happy hour menu and 1 item from a regular menu.  If you are ordering mojito, make sure which mojito you are ordering.   I said \"mojito\" meaning that the mojito in a happy hour menu, \"Fish House mojito ($7)\" but the server asked if I am ordering the \"tropical mojito\"? which cost you $15, he did not explain the difference in between my mojito and the tropical mojito so I've got an impression that he just attempted to sell higher priced item.  Nothing wrong with the tropical mojito, it is sounds like a nice mojito if you would like to spend extra money and sugar for experiment. \n\nWe finished everything, everything was amazing.

More over, a bar table, I mean a small round high table (with no napkins or utensils) in a bar area normally considered to be a bar, eligible for a happy hour menu at least in Seattle.   \n\nAnyway, he fixed the price to a happy hour menu price (except one item which I could have mentioned but I didn't).  \n\nI would give them 5 stars if I did not have confusing experience about their happy hour system and the server did not attempted to sell me a higher price mojito."

He told me it was straight lychee flavored vodka!  Yikes! Had I known that...I wouldve gotten something more wussy than a lychee martini.  ironic huh!"

The fresh oysters, shrimp, scallop cerviche and king crab tasted very sweet.  \n\nFor our first course, we had the clam chowder  - Wow! one of the bests in Vegas (I always order clam chowder and compare it to others) and I had the ceasar salad which I enjoyed.  The dressing was nice and light.\n\nFor our main course, my father had one of Emeril's signature dishes, the Seafood Pan Roast.  It had shrimp, muscles and andouille sausage on top of perfectly spiced rice.  We all tried it and loved it.\n\nI had the blue crab crabcakes and it was heavenly.  Lightly seasoned with a beautiful sauce - and only enough so that you can enjoy that  sweet blue crab taste.\n\nMy mother had the tasty Rib-Eye with the smoothest, most delicious red potato mash.  We were tasting and enjoying each other's entrees very much.\n\nLastly, we topped the night off with \"Taste of New Orleans\" dessert sample which had smaller samplings of  Southern Pecan Pie, Bread and Butter Bread Pudding and Creamy Banana Pie.  We polished off that plate!\n\nAll in all,  the great food was surpassed only by the attentive service.  In total, I think 5 people waited on us and it really made for such a wonderful dinner.  Kudos to the chefs in back and thank you to the servers and wait staff - you made me a hero in front of my parents and  you guys rock!!"

Only complaint food-wise was portion size and the strawberry sorbet (for the anniversary with the boyfriend)tasted like it was ice with a nasty and thick strawberry syrup. I'm sure it was house-made like they said, just not my taste. \nOk so what really was the issue??\nI made a reservation for 8:15. We are staying at the MGM grand and saw that this restaurant was in our price point and thought the food and service would be excellent based on the name attached to the restaurant. Wrong. \nWe were seated promptly for a slow Tuesday night. After that moment, service was slow/non-existent. As someone who works in both the hotel and food service industry I consider myself pretty understanding when it comes to mishaps or slow service based on uncontrollable circumstances. This time, I couldn't see a single one. The restaurant was over-staffed. I was given THREE possible waiters names that we could have had after a menu was dropped(10 minutes after we were seated)Quite honestly I wouldn't even know which one I had, he never introduced himself. We perused the menu for another 20-25 minutes which gave us plenty of time to pick an appetizer, read the lengthy wine list, entrees AND make selections on all of them. I am an incredibly indecisive person so I find it odd when I haven't been bothered at least twice before I finally make my decision on a meal. Boyfriend is a way more impatient person than I am. I tried to be understanding about the length of the wait for menus, water, drinks, appetizer, and entrees. But when my waiter doesn't even stop by the table in the middle of my waiting period to ensure my food was on it's way and a guesstimate of the time is alarming. Even the managers looked they had jacks**** to do. What ever happened to manager table-touching? I manage I know what's up! Also thank you for making me feel like I was 6 years old while taking my drink order! I understand I look young and need my ID  to order drinks.\n\nSafe to say we payed the bill as quickly as possible didn't question and badger boyfriend about tip size, because I was pissed too, and left. Wouldn't recommend until management gets their stuff together and re-trains their wait staff to be personable and attentive to the guests regardless the night and estimated age group. Good service should be consistent and I think the rest of the yelp community would agree with me!"

Mahi is pretty much a perfect creation as it is, and there's no need to do much to it.The rest of the entree was absolutely fantastic though - I loved loved loved the orzo and mushrooms and the mussels we ordered were tasty too.\n\nOne slight annoyance was that they wouldn't split the entrees for us so we had to do it ourselves. I know that may not be the \"classiest\" thing to do at a white-tablecloth restaurant, but we each wanted to try more than one thing and we didn't want to spend 100 bucks on lunch alone. It seemed like an easy enough request to accommodate but whatever. \n\nAs others have mentioned, the best part of the meal by far was the banana cream pie! If you go, you must try it. It was completely decadent without being too heavy or too sweet. The pie alone is worth the trip."

That's a shame, because my experience was fantastic.\n\nWe had a 6:45pm reservation (made months in advance) and had to wait 30 minutes when we arrived. The manager personally came out to apologize to us and offered us drinks and dessert on the house for the entire evening. I've been to plenty of places where they sort of shaft you on the amount of alcohol - not here. I ordered a Jack & Coke with a lime wedge to start off with and the bartender, on his own, made it with Gentleman Jack and it was stiff to say the least. Nice crushed ice served in a very unique high ball glass. All night long, they made sure that a fresh high ball glass of our drinks were following as soon as one was empty. \n\nWith what I thought was a proper handling of the table situation, we waited for our table to open, sipping drinks and admiring the scenery. Once seated, we ordered the Port Judith Calimari and the seared yellowfin tuna for starters. Both were outstanding. I'm a harsh judge of calimari and Emeril's did not disappoint. Still not the best I've ever had, but definitely up there. I ordered the pecan crusted Texas redfish, pepper jack potato rosti, creole meuniere sauce and grilled vegetable ratatouille. It was absolutely delicious. The smash across the face you received from the melody of flavors was incredible. I don't recall what my friend ordered but he was raving about it.\n\nFor dessert, we were told by our waitress if there is one dessert you must try, it is Emeril's Banana Cream Pie. Words fail to describe how delicious and filling this was. It was served in a nice warm cast iron skillet, with gorgeous chocolate shavings nestled on top.  \n\nThe service: top notch. Our waitress was prompt, courteous, full of recommendations and explanations of flavors on each dish, and never far from us. Zero complaints. I never once had to ask for anything - it just appeared. \n\nThe interior d\u00e9cor: well thought out, with a nice earth tone color scheme which is accentuated by a wide variety of brilliant sapphire blues, yellows, purples, reds, and silvers at the bar and around the restaurant. It has a very trendy, but authentic New Orleans flare to it. The bar at the center has a nice feel to it, with nicely back lit liquor shelves to showcase Emeril's offerings. There is a ridiculous amount of wine racks all around the exterior of the restaurant, giving patrons quite the selection from which to choose.\n\nThe price: frankly, I thought the prices on the menu were fair for the caliber of restaurant such as Emeril's in a city like Vegas. My entr\u00e9e was $28, and when I got the bill, much to my surprise, the manager had also comped our appetizers. So all we ended up paying for was our entr\u00e9es. Really, that is going above and beyond to correct a mistake.\n\nThe manager paid us a visit once at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, apologizing once again for the delay, and asking us if we would come back. The answer was a resounding yes. We thanked him for his hospitality and his drive to make our visit the best it could be.\n\nI am sure sorry if Emeril's at the MGM Grand has gone downhill since I visited a few years back. But I stand by my review. When I was there, they treated us incredibly well and made a faux pax on their part with our reservation right."

Came straight to the MGM from the MCcarran Rental Car Center because I wanted to take advantage of the lunch menu. My server didn't seem to enthused to see a solo diner in her section. It was very obvious because she focused all her attention on the tables directly in front of me and those on the side. She treated me as if my money was no good...that's too bad blondie because I am usually a VERY good tipper but you pissed me off. I really wish I had that overly accommodating friendly gentleman waiter because that would have given me a better overall dining experience. I would have given Emeril's 4 stars for the food. However, I had to deduct 1 star because the service needs a serious overhaul. Overall, the food was really good. Here's what I ordered: \n\nGumbo $7.00 - \nVERY disappointing! It had precooked skimpy shrimp and pea sized andouille sausage that you need a microscope to see. Honestly, it tasted straight out of a soup can. Campbells makes a better gumbo than this. Sorry Emeril, I suggest you go back to the drawing board on the gumbo. \n\nPan Roast $24.00 - \nTwo small medallions of fish, shrimp and I believe pea sized andouille sausage in Cajun spices over rice). DELICIOUS! I was a bit skeptical after that boxed gumbo experience, but the pan roast was phenomenal. I added Emerils Kicked Up Green Pepper Sauce for an extra kick. loved the sauce so much that I purchased some to take back home. \n\nEmerils Kicked Up Green Sauce $2.80. The bomb!!! \n\nButter Bread Pudding in Warm Whiskey Sauce - Comped because their was a glitch with my reservation. They even included a scoop of delicious cinamon ice cream. OUT OF THIS WORLD! \n\nIce Tea $3.00 \n\nGrand Total - $39.54 before tip \n\nIf you love Emeril and you just have to check Emeril's New Orleans Fish Hose off your list, consider going for lunch."

The front is very open to the shopping/food court area of the hotel which made it too loud and less intimate for fine dining. The decor was just plain ugly, with random wall pieces, prints of onyx (which looks like either bread or intestines, depending on your perspective) and streamers?\n\nThe food was even worse. I had the mixed grill, which was scallops, shrimp and crab claws. The scallops were cooked well, but the shrimp were definitely not. They were severely overcooked. Nothing on the plate had any seasoning at all, nor sauce, butter or garnish..nothing..just a plate of a few dry shrimp, bland scallops and plain, boiled crab claws. The presentation was so bad that I couldn't believe the place bears Emeril's name. I would love to see him judge the plate I was served on Top Chef!!\n\nTied for worst thing about this place was the house wine. While they have an impressive wine list, there is relatively little by the glass. We each had a glass of the house white. Oh my.. It is soooo bad. Rarely do we find a wine we can't drink a glass of..this is on the list. Maybe this is the punishment for not buying a nice bottle...blech..\n\nSave your money, plenty of good places to eat in Las Vegas. This isn't one of them."

Emeril Lagasse is an American celebrity chef, whose specialty includes Cajun, Creole and French. And did I mention that he is also a James Beard Award winner and have semi-regular appearances on Bravo's Top Chef? Now you know why we came here.\n\nFor starter, we had the Maine Lobster Bisque and the Gumbo. The decision to order the Gumbo was self-explanatory. We were at a Cajun restaurant after all. I found the gumbo to be a bit salty and a bit too peppery, although my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I ordered the lobster bisque because, well, it is one of my favourite dishes of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed the lobster bisque, it had fantastic lobster flavours... briny and savoury. It was the perfect consistency, not too thick, not too thin. However, it had little white clumps throughout the bisque, likely undissolved corn starch or flour, whatever they used to thicken the bisque. They also could have put in a few more chunks of lobster... It's okay, I understand, lobsters don't grow on trees, do they now? Despite the flour clumps and the lack of chunky lobsters, the bisque was excellent. I would order it again in a heartbeat.\n\nFor the main course, we had the Crystal Fried Shrimp Po Boy and Emeril's Barbecued Shrimp. I found both dishes to be on the salty side. Unfortunately the Shrimp Po Boy, which I was so looking forward to, turned out to be a disappointment. The saltiness covered all other flavours.  Not ideal. The upside is that the portion sizes were humongous. Come here on an empty tummy!\n\nI documented my whole Las Vegas trip on my blog, please come and visit for reviews on other restaurants and loads of pictures! ;)\n\nhttp://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/08/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-mgm.html"

This was Emeril's first restaurant in Vegas before Delmonico steakhouse and Table 10 (both very good as well).  \n\nThis restaurant has a selection of not only cajun inspired seafood dishes like po boys and etouffe, they also offer more diversity with dishes like asian inspired ribs and salads.\n\nOn this visit, we were feeling quite ambitious.  We started off with the cerviche- there was a mix a fish and shrimp, marinated in a tomato sauce and topped with avocado and chiles.  This was served with tortilla chips.  This was a pretty mellowed down cerviche as it wasn't overwhelmingly citrus-y.  We also got a few raw oysters that were served with cocktail sauce and the traditional mignonette sauce.  Can't go wrong with these as they were very fresh.\n\nFor entrees, the bf got the rock shrimp po boy.  It was pretty good although I have to say the breading was a little thick.  The cajun fries that came with it were wonderfully flavorful.  I had a house salad and the gumbo.  The salad was simple- dressed with lemon and olive oil which was very refreshing.  The gumbo was as good as ever- served over rice and even more amazing with some hot sauce.\n\nFor dessert, you can't skip the banana cream pie.  This has always been my favorite dessert and I'm not even that big of a fan of sweets.  I had tried to get this at Table 10 last time but was sad they didn't make the banana cream pie.  Anyways, this slice of pie is $8...but I think it's worth it.  It's decadent and ridiculously rich...but you only live once.  The pie has a great graham cracker crust and a wonderful vanilla custard surrounding fresh slices of banana.  It's topped with thick whipped cream and drizzled with caramel sauce and a few chocolate curls for garnish.  My favorite thing at Emeril's for sure!!!\n\nThis place would normally get 5 stars from me but the service was lacking.  I originally had reservations here but the bar looked empty and we were early.  However, after ordering, the bar filled up and our service was pretty much non existent.  We had to flag someone down to get our food after someone from the kitchen delivered it to the counter for the bartenders.  It wasn't the bartenders' fault that it was so busy but overall the place felt understaffed.  I recommend getting a reservation for this place as table service would probably be a lot better.  Lastly, this place is pricey but for the quality and flavor of the food I think it's worth it."

Even with $80 chewy lobster, I still adore him and hope one day I get the chance to tell him face to face how he and his shows made a terrible time in my life so much better."

I had to convince her it wasn't a good idea to dig her teeth into the waiter who was quite appetizing.  And how tacky to let people into Emeril's with foot long plastic Hurricane Slurricane cups spilling over  with extra dollar shots of 151.  We got them at Coyote Ugly, I think?  It must have been celebrity night because the Devil himself, his Angelic wife, Mount Rushmore and Little Bo Peep dined at the next table.  It was all so surreal.  It could only have been better if Emeril himself stopped by to say hello.  Maybe next time."

Pork sliders pair perfectly with a pale ale. They serve Firestone which happens to be my favorite brewery.  Also tried the barbecue shrimp and really liked the sauce. Shrimp cocktail was ok and gumbo not too spicy.

First off, the bread they bring you is out of this world. I think I would have been fine paying for a bucket of that for my meal instead of what I actually got. Not that the cornmeal fried oysters or po' boy were bad, they just didnt do anything for me. The po' boy especially seemed to be all bread, I don't even recall at this point...and I have a memory like an elephant...what the hell was in it. The one thing about Vegas I wish would change is that more high end restaurants would be open during lunch hrs so people can try there fare for 'fairer' prices, even if its still expensive, heck...I'm on vacation...and it;s better than having to settle for another one of Emeril's crappy restaurants."

I don't want to say this experience was not good but I feel some entrees could have been better. The service in this place is very attentive, wish they were the same on the meals they are dishing out.\n\nFor starters we tried the Calamari, short ribs, my date tried the Rosemary & Balsamic Poached Chicken Breast & I had the Barbecued Salmon and for our side dish we decided on the Truffle Mac & Cheese.\n\nThe Calamari was good, but after a while it became overwhelming with the spices the breading contains, good thing they offer two dipping sauces to change it up a bit, as for the Chicken, it had no flavor what so ever, not sure if Emerils Kitchen had a off day or they are not good in making a chicken dish, I want to think that maybe they forgot something. The Barbecued Salmon was delicious; the BBQ sauce gave it a taste I have never experienced before. I think the Mac & Cheese was good, my date thought it was salty, taste buds right...\n\n\nI hope to come back and try other items soon and hope some of those items will be great and not just good.\n\nIf you want to save some cash try out the 4 Tix places to get a 20% discount on your meal, the wallet will not hurt as bad if you are disappointed in some meals like myself and some other yelpers on here.\n\nTry it out for yourself and I hope you enjoy your meal."

The restaurant has a $25 corkage fee which we though was reasonable and they were more than accommodating with our champagne. The interior was cool, the bar area had some neat decor and overall had a pretty inviting atmosphere. \n\nHighlight of the night: Michael, our server. Great guy, great recommendations and genuinely a good dude! Chat him up if given the opportunity, he's got some tales to tell!\n\nOverall, food was good. The sashimi grade scallops were done to perfection, literally melted in your mouth. We were going to do the crab cakes, but Michael recommended the scallops... so glad he did! They were delicious. Then we had the BBQed salmon and some white-sauce/shrimp/pasta dish that I can't remember the name of at the moment... the salmon was done perfectly, the prawns and pasta were smothered in garlic (overwhelming or nauseatingly delicious, depends how much you like garlic!), the andouille sausage and potato hash was great... only problem was the onion rings that came with the salmon. They were SO over-seasoned that it was difficult to enjoy them with the other components of the dish. Granted, southerners tend to season a little more liberally than others... stereotype? I don't know, after watching some TV shows on southern food I think it's probably true! Regardless, we were happy with out meals.\n\nSecond highlight of the night: the banana cream pie!!!!! If you're like me, it doesn't sound all that appetizing. Until you see it!! Man, what a dessert... so tasty, we debated seconds for 10 minutes!"

I noticed that Fall River Clam Chowder was served. I was excited about this and shared with the hostesses that I was born and raised in Fall River and Emeril actually lived next door to my grandmother. They seemed completely disinterested. I mean...how many times has a guest been actually from Fall River??? I asked if it was possible to place a take-out order of the chowder and they indicated yes with no problem. So, we left and I tried to keep this is an option for later. I returned the next day, same hostesses, same poor disposition. However, I really wanted to order the chowder and they have nothing to do with that. When I inquired about the ordering, they said I needed to order at the bar. I went to the bar and placed an order for 2 Fall River Clam Chowders to go. My husband, being from the midwest, wants nothing to do with any seafood, so he had picked up something else from the food court. He met me at the bar while I waited for my order. After about 15 minutes, I had to ask for a glass of water. No offer of water or any other beverage was offered to me. Another poor bat at service. Then after my water was brought to me, the bartender told me that they were out of containers and could not fulfill my take-out order. So, my husband asked...trying to be kind to me, if he could eat his food there if I changed to dine-in. They said no. So strike 1, 2 and 3. Never got my Fall River Clam Chowder! And I will likely not ever in the future as this experience has left me completely dissatisfied and will not recommend or return. Wicked BAD all around."

This time, we came with another couple friend and shared our entrees so that we could try a variety of dishes they had.\n\nDuring our 2nd visit, we decided to order frog legs; it was the first time all four of us tried frog legs.  Honestly, I had no expectations on this dish at that time since I wasn't feeling well.  When I first saw it, I thought it was shrimp tempura and it took a while to figure out that it was actually frog legs.  It tasted pretty yummy and the meat was very tender!\n\nDuring our meal, I noticed that the staff changed out our used utensils and plates after each \"course\" we ate.  They were also very kind and observant; they gave us extra small plates since they seemed to know that we were sharing our food.  Also, the staff provided us with a complementary blackberry-something sorbet to help celebrate my husband's birthday!  It was extremely nice of them!  Plus, it was soooooo good!!!!  A perfect finish to our lunch meal!\n\nKorean Elvis' turn:\nYes, the food and service was superb as was the last time we dined here two years earlier. Also yes, the frog legs were my choice since I wanted the food that might to be authentically Cajun. \n\nThe food was as delicious as before. We got the gumbo, a steak dish, a fish dish, and yes; the frog legs. In my history eating at celebrity chefs' restaurants were always hit or miss. For example, eating at Mario Batali's Carnevino was awesome while Wolfgang Puck's restaurants in Hawaii was a total waste of money and expectations. However, this place is up there in all of the restaurants I have been to in Vegas. \n\nAs the wife had said, they changed our utensils before every course. This is called pre-bussing and I have only seen it done in less than a handful of restaurants in Hawaii: Morton's among a few others. This shows the level of service which is met in these restaurants. We went there the day of my birthday, and the restaurant provided a sorbet to commemorate! That was going above and beyond what I expected in this place!\n\nIf you're looking for great service that doesn't break the Vegas budget too much with great Cajun food, I wholeheartedly suggest this eatery in the MGM. Happy yelping everyone!"

We were there on a Sunday, so the waits people were complaining about didn't effect us...althou we were warned when someone ordered the pork chop they take a long time to cook...\n\nDue to the $$$ and being on a work expense budget, my pals and I had to stay away from the bar items, and stuck with plain old beer. The bread and whipped butter was fantastic thou! \n\nI had the house salad for 12 bucks and a deep fried salmon sushi roll of sorts...I have had better sushi rolls in my life. I liked it better than one of the other people there with me...I actually ate the whole thing. My salad was pretty good...the white cheddar in it made it better off than an average house salad...dressing had a good flavor to it. \n\nEveryone seemed to think their meals were ok, nothing great, nothing horrible....most of us got 2 appetizers as opposed to a crazy expensive entree. I am sure at places like this it varies by the night...but to be honest I didn't really catch on to the \"New Orleans' theme of the dishes either."

            "review": "I hesitate to give this place 5 stars due to the mixed reviews, but my experience here was just that.\n\nI did have my doubts in the beginning, especially after reading a considerable amount of 1-3 star reviews and the fact that I was able to easily reserve a table for 10 at 7:30p on a Saturday night - I did it on Open Table around 3:30p that same day!\n\nReason #1 - my uncle called me last minute to tell me that 2 more people were coming so had to adjust our reservation of 10 to 12.  They said no problem.  We still had to wait maybe 15 minutes passed our reservation time since we had to wait for the party before us to finish their dinner, which was not a big problem.\n\nReason #2 - our server was nice (don't remember his name) and pretty much everything came out in a timely manner.  If anything, our entrees took a little bit longer than our drinks and appetizers.\n\nReason #3 - from the bread basket to our desserts, food was really good!  The bread basket consisted of pretzel rolls and onion rolls, both were warm and soft and oh-so-yummy.  The gumbo ($14) and clam chowder ($13) were good, the apple & butter lettuce salad ($13 for small) needed more flavor though.  I got the BBQ'd Atlantic salmon ($34), and it was so tasty that even my petite mom who ordered the same thing finished her entire plate.  Hubby's rib eye steak ($49) was big and juicy, and the mac & cheese ($12) was creamy and cheesy.\n\nBTW, there was no kid's menu obviously, so my older one got the clam chowder and side of basil & spinach fettuccine ($9), and little one just got the side mac & cheese and they were fine with that...my little one ended up eating half of my salmon anyways (more mac & cheese for me!).\n\nAlthough we were all so stuffed, I really wanted to try their bread pudding (I LOOOVE bread pudding) so I ordered that ($11) and my older one got the fruit sorbet ($6).  Holy Creoley (ba-dum-tsss) it was one of the best bread pudding I've ever tasted!  More soaked and moist than what I'm used to (looked kind of like oatmeal), but warm with a hint of whiskey (very very subtle)...ohhh yeahhh.  The fruit sorbet came in three scoops (was expecting just one) and the flavor was mild and smooth.  It's homemade and sure tasted like it :9\n\nThe prices here are definitely not proportionate to the amount that you get, but rather proportionate to the taste?  Maybe my group came on a good day or something, but we all certainly left with happy bellies."

So, that's the reason I wanted to go to this restaurant.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor wasn't impressive, it was pretty manly looking (fish statue, fish scale design). The hostess was very nice (I made a reservation on open table). The waiter was very nice and knew the menu very well. I had never heard of red fish, he told me all about it. I don't eat red meat so I asked if there was any meat in the grits, he went and made sure and I ended up not getting the sauce because it had veal stock. He brought me a side sauce, but I liked my meal better without it. \n\nThe red fish was breaded. It was served on top of grits and sauteed mushrooms (I think). Everything was delicious. The fish was amazing, the mushrooms were perfect, and the grits were yummy! My mom tried it and she thought it was delicious too. I practically licked the plate! I wish I could eat it all again right now!\n\nMy mom ordered the stuffed Shrimp and that was also delicious. It was served with a little black pea salad that was amazingly tasty.\n\nYou also get cornbread as you wait, oh my gosh it is so good! It was the best bread basket I ever had in Vegas. I had to refrain from eating it all because I wanted to save room for my meal.\n\nThe meal came pretty quickly too. The server was very attentive. Overall best restaurant I've been to Vegas, and maybe ever!\n\nI liked this place way better than Mesa Grill (sorry Bobby)."

Like a lot of these places in Las Vegas they're in a casino, this one is in the MGM Grand.  I wonder how involved Emeril Lagasse really is in this place.

Then I sat and expected my tastebuds to be amazed, but to no avail - they were only teased.\n\nEmeril's Sweet Barbecued Scottish Salmon Andouille Sausage & Brabant Potatoes with Spicy Onion Crust and Emeril's Homemade Worcestershire: a very tender piece of salmon, but clearly not worth the $33 something price. I've had the same exact salmon many times. Nothing made his dish unique nor worth it's price. 3 stars because it did nothing for me to justify being at Emeril's.\n\nPan Roasted Free Range Chicken Gruyere Cheese, Onion & Potato Gratin, Baby Fris\u00e9e & Cherry Tomatoes Horseradish Brandy Demi Glace: my friend ordered this and it was very tasty.

Obviously unable to rate the restaurant experience as a whole considering the fact that our 26 menu items were served almost exclusively by Chef Heath and the kitchen staff, there is little doubt in my mind that Emeril's New Orleans Fish House is as good today as it ever has been."

            "review": "I agree with Virginia Y's review about the bam factor.  Almost everything I had was waaay too salty for my liking!  Even the rosemary bread - though pretty tasty... again, the salt factor spoiled it for me... \n\ni suppose I shouldn't be too surprised by how the dishes were overly 'seasoned'.  I mean, have you seen the amount of salt Emeril 'bams' his bloody way through his shows?  Apparently, the chef that day was also doing his take on his boss's style.  I like Emeril - as a tv entertainer behind his fancy little kitchen in the studio... studio in the kitchen?  Anywayz, he makes people laugh and unlike Bobby Flay, i don't find him sickening and annoying.  But I honestly don't see him as a chef.  I mean, how many gazillion dishes can you put the same bloody seasoning on?!    \n\nTo start, I had the shrimp remoulade salad - nothing special.  I wish they'd given me some extra remoulade sauce on the side... it was barely enough to taste - however, the little I tasted, it made me want more - the one bloody thing they don't give me more of is the sauce I want - of course!  It was good but it could have been far better.  My husband had the blue crab and bell pepper fondue - he loved it and said it was very well executed, whatever that means.  Think he's also been watching too much Top Chef :)  We got the seafood gumbo to share - yes we were being complete pigs!  Shit, we were being comped $100 by the casino for our meal so don't think we were going to be coy and not take full advantage of it :)  ...surprisingly, the gumbo was very tasty!  I've had my share of bad gumbo (even in New Orleans!) so I must say, I was nicely impressed.  \n\nFor entrees, we had the seafood pan roast with jambalaya and the fish special of the day; striped bass with corn macque choux.  Both the jambalaya and the corn macque choux were absolutely delicious.  As for the the fish in both dishes, they were omg way too salty!  ...so was the butter sauce on the pan roast.  Insane!  Nice thing was, when I brought it up to our second waiter, he was very good about it and actually offered to get the kitchen to redo my dish.  No, I didn't let them - after all, by that time, I had enough food in me to last me another week!\n\nOur first waiter (unlike our second one) was the most depressing looking service person on the job.  When he was serving us and telling us the specials, he never once smiled nor looked like he wanted to be there... but when he was either standing with his other colleagues chatting away or when he was standing by himself talking (to himself) - I kid you not - he looked like he'd taken some serious happy pills!  It was quite funny - especially when it looked like he was at a stand-up comedy routine all by himself.  Yes he was laughing!  Ok, I was obviously a little too distracted by this guy...\n\nIf it wasn't for the saltiness of the food, I would have given it at least a 1/2 more star... the weird waiter didn't bother me too much.  It was just funny to me.  Will I go back to Emeril's?  Sure... especially if the casino would like to pay our way again.  Our tab that day (before tipping) came up to a whole dollar over the $100 comped :D"

As many of you know, I'm on the hunt for \"real, original, great looking and tasting\" appletinis and I finally found it at Emeril's!  However, it was only because I spoke to the bartender personally about the ingredients he would used and asked him to substitute \"sweet and sour\" with Midori.   With that settled, I receive the beautiful, bright green appletini with that burst of flavor only Pucker & Midori can deliver.   I asked for another (not realizing my bartender had changed) and he brought me the cheap, sweet & sour, dirty-martini-looking drink and I told him that was not what I had previously and then had to tell him how to make it).  At least I held my ground and didn't just drink it to be nice.   At $17 to $20 a pop for cocktails in Vegas - get what YOU want, not what you are SERVED!!!   We had such a good time at this bar.  It is absolutely gorgeous and the crowd was fun.  We even had the Neil Diamond look-alike sitting three chairs away from us.  It was too funny - he looked just like Neil did in the 70's!  He, He.

That can happen just shows that staff may need some training. Our large group had almost same feeling that it was Ok but not up to overall standards of other Vegas establishment. Michael Mina's pub is 50 feet away - much better. Trattoria is 50 feet the other direction too. Decor is Ok. Somewhat diner like atmosphere yet prices are not diner like."

We had a 11:30am reservation and was seated immediately....there were only 2 other tables being occupied at that time.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and attentive as well as patient while we decided on what to chow down on.  We started with lobster bisque and gumbo, followed by sharing a wedge salad.  Lobster bisque did not look very appealing, but it was so tasty!  Gumbo had a nice kick to it and was very filling.  Their wedge salad didn't come with blue cheese, but ranch dressing instead...which was different.\n\nI had the Seafood Etouffee and he had the Shrimp Po Boy as entrees.  We both enjoyed every bit.  They were quite large portions for lunch and we were stuffed, but had to split the Banana Cream Pie for dessert.  CANNOT leave Emeril's without the Banana Cream Pie!!!  It is delicious!\n\nWe had a great meal here and it was a great start to our foodcation in Vegas!  We would definitely go back."

The clam chowder is amazing, thick, creamy and full of clams, not to mention HUGE! The blue crab meat spread is also very delicious. Both the sea bass and salmon entrees are flavorful and fill you up! The chicken comes in a large portion and is pretty good too.

It had wonderful lump crab meat. Other than that, it tasted average at best. Not your typical crab cake. \n\nWe split a Caesar salad. It was a romaine heart cut in half.

They bring enough servers to be able to place everyone's dishes in front of them simultaneously which I thought was pretty cool (I know, I'm a dork).\n\nThey start off by giving you a dinner roll and a piece of cornbread. Though they weren't bad, I expected more from Emeril. Of course I wouldn't downgrade a restaurant just because of bread but I love bread and good bread can certainly make a difference in your opinion of the restaurant.\n\nThe rest of the food, from the appetizers to the main course (we didn't have room for dessert, though I regret not trying the banana creme pie), was extremely flavorful. The gumbo had a nice little kick to it but it wasn't overpowering. The baked scallops on the half shell (3 per order) and the fried blue crab cakes were both quite tasty.\n\nI ordered the barbecued salmon (I know, I never imagined joining those two things together) and I thought it was delicious. I usually prefer salmon raw because restaurants tend to overcook them and dry them out, but this one was cooked just right: tender, moist and full of flavor.\n\nThe prices were a bit higher than usual but that's what you get for eating at a place with a big name attached to it.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed this meal. But I should mention... as flavorful as I thought the food was, I thought everything was a bit salty (if you're Korean, the more accurate word would be 'jjah') so keep that in mind when you go."

We were staying at the MGM and didn't want the hassle of waiting in line to cab it to and from another hotel and this was the first time any of us would be eating at an \"Emerial\" restaurant.  I made same day reservations, on a Saturday, without any issue.\n\nOur reservation was at 9pm. Once seated and settled, we asked our server about entree recommendations. The items that our server recommended, in the exact order: 1) \"Cedar Camp Fire Plank Steak--16 ounce Black Angus Ribeye, Warm Remoulade Sauce, Emeril's Worcestershire and Country Smashed Potatoes,\" \n2) \"Cider Brined Double Cut Pork Chop--Rosemary & Chive Potato Puree, Savoy Cabbage and Natural Reduction,\" 3) \"Emeril's Barbecued Atlantic Salmon--House Made Andouille Pork Sausage, Brabant Potato Hash, Sweet Barbecue Sauce and Crispy Onion Crust\" and 4) the Diver Scallops. I was surprised to hear that the steak and pork chop were among his recommendations since this was a seafood restaurant.\n\nOUR ORDER:\n**Sides: Andouille Sausage Jambalaya & Port Wine & Foie Gras Sauteed Wild Mushrooms\n**Entrees: The Halibut for me; the Diver Scallops for my mom; and the Cedar Camp Fire Plank Steak for my sister\n**Dessert: the Banana Cream Pie\n\nThe sides were very good, especially the Wild Mushrooms. It was very rich, probably due to the foie gras. Between the 3 of us, there were leftovers because after while the richness of it all was too much.  My halibut looked good as it was presented over a bed of beans, small veggies, and nuts mixed in a red tomato type sauce. However it was a bit salty and overcooked. My mom's scallops were very good, 4 large ones on a plate along with asparagus and small side of the same wild mushrooms.  My sister's steak was surprisingly very good, which made me understand our sever's recommendation. Cooked well, seasoned well, with a combo of textures from the steak to the mashed potatoes.  \n\nNow the best thing out of the entire meal was dessert. Again we asked our server for his recommendation and he couldn't stop raving about the banana cream pie. Now I'm not a fan of banana flavored bread, cakes, cupcakes, pudding, including pie. However, because he was spot on about the steak I decided to take a leap of faith and get on board with my mom and sister who both wanted the banana cream pie.  The pie came and went...we devoured all of it. Light, fluffy, with a hint of banana it wasn't as bad as I had imagined it to be. I'd go so far as to say this was the best banana cream pie I've ever had...definitely made with quality ingredients. \n\nSo overall, my 1st time at an \"Emeril\" restaurant was ok. The side of wild mushrooms; the cedar plank steak; and the lovely banana cream pie were the food highlights of the meal. I doubt I'd come back if it were up to me, but I'm definitely glad I tried it."

We were so looking forward to barbecue shrimp with grits for dinner so we walked all the way over from The Venetian cutting short our gambling and skipped eating at one of their restaurants for convenience.  The andouille gumbo and clam chowder were fantastic.  The barbecue shrimp was disappointing compared to the same dish at his NOLA restaurant in New Orleans.  There were no grits and the shrimp was spice-rubbed resulting in a very spicy taste which we didn't expect.  Now I adore spicy foods, but was looking forward to the same dish served at NOLA.  But the lack of grits really upset me as a southern girl myself.  Bring back the original dish with grits!  Service was excellent, but we left after finishing our entrees so we could indulge at a Chinatown bakery to soothe our disappointment."

My drink of choice for the entire evening was a belvedere with 7 and a lime. \n\nThe first course we had a Caesar (nothing special) and a kale salad with walnuts & a raisin vinaigrette (loved it). Next course was some alligator balls (wasn't into the texture) and BBQ shrimp with a warm mini biscuit (delicious). Next came out the main courses, I had the BBQ salmon which was really good & my man had a steak with rosemary mashed potatoes (amazing). Our last course which was dessert was my least favorite of the evening. The banana cream pie was ok, and my chocolate lava cake was paired with some cherry sauce & a scoop of peanut butter marscapone (weird combo) the cake itself was very good. My night ended with a cappuccino & overall we had a great time."

The service was on par and the waiter was very attentive.  I had the fisherman's stew and it lacked flavor. The jambalaya was better, but kind of dry and even though it was a side it could have been an entree with such a large portion. My friends had the salmon and seemed to enjoy it much better than I enjoyed mine. I probably wouldn't go back again. It wasn't worth the money, in my opinion."

I am not a big seafood fan especially anywhere not in New England where I am from, but I agreed.\n\nThe staff was nice and polite, my drinks were excellent. Myself and my friends husband both got the \"Maine\" lobster carbonara. It was awesome! Real Maine lobster, ( not the weird kind of lobster they have on the West coast). Big chuncks and list if it, they did not skimp. Lots of bacon and snap peas and just the right ammount of sauce. Not dry or soup, perfect! I don't remember what my friend got but she loved it. We were so full from dinner, we just got coffee and skipped desert.\n\nI would definately reccomend it and will go back again. The only negative is that it is kind of pricy, but its Vegas and everything there is expensive."

            "review": "A few dishes warrant three stars, but the majority? Meh.\n\nOn our fourth day of Restaurant Week, we dined at Emeril's Fish House. It's one of the few restaurants I've never experienced at MGM Grand. We had 6 o'clock reservations and we were seated promptly. All three of us chose the Restaurant Week menu for $50.13. We started with salads: the Heirloom Tomato Salad - Spanish Blue Cheese, Red Onion, Basil, Herb Vinaigrette and Aged Balsamic Vinegar and the Caesar Salad - Romaine Hearts, Parmesan Cheese, Roasted Garlic Grissini and Creamy House Made Dressing. The tomatoes weren't as hearty as we'd hope, but the blue cheese was high octane and really stellar. I had hoped the Caesar house dressing would be like what's offered at Delmonico. Unfortunately, it wasn't. This romaine was overdressed and the dressing was too sweet for my liking. \n\nOur second course was Shrimp & Andouille Pork Sausage Gumbo - Okra & Long Grain Rice and Chef Emeril's Fall River Clam Chowder - Apple Smoked Bacon & Idaho Potatoes. I was torn between the two but went with the Gumbo since we were in Emeril's house. The chowder, however, was the better choice. It was velvety and the clams were perfectly tender. The Gumbo lacked \"Bam!\" it was really mild. Though, not overly salty like many I tried in New Orleans. \n\nWe sampled each of the options for the third course: Horseradish Grilled Blue Shrimp - Patty pan Squash, Zucchini & Pearl Couscous and Preserved Meyer Lemon, Chef Emeril's Sweet Barbecued Atlantic Salmon - Spicy Andouille Pork Sausage Hash, Crystal Fried Onion Crust and Emeril's House made Worcestershire and Grilled Double Cut Pork Chop - Chive Blossom & Yukon Gold Potato Puree, and Wilted Spinach.\n\nThe shrimp was the winning dish. It was well seasoned and not a bit overcooked. I wish I had ordered it, instead I had the BBQ Salmon. I ordered it since \"fish house\" is in the name and I've never had salmon barbequed. In short, I was very underwhelmed. It was underseasoned and lacked pizazz. The sweetness hid the natural salmon flavor. The hash was so overly salty I couldn't eat it. The double cut pork chop was prepared medium. It was cooked to order, but it was tough! And also terribly bland. Yet, the spinach was so salty it was inedible.\n \nI welcomed dessert and when it was delivered our server said \"and now, for the best part!\" Sadly, it was the best part. The didn't have the Lemon & Angel Food Cake Trifle that was posted online. So, I decided to give Emeril's Banana Cream Pie another chance. I had it before at Delmonico and it was served frozen. Thankfully, this was one was ice crystal free. It seemed to have more cream than banana; it was nothing I'd rave about or even order again, but it was pretty good. The guys chose the butter and bread pudding. This was the highlight of the night. Tender, gooey bread, and slightly sweet. \n\nService was attentive. However, I found dinner service a bit odd. Each course was brought out on an enormous tray with each dish covered and then placed on a stand. The covers were removed and then the food would sit until a few servers could gather to serve all dishes at the same time. It looked like a parade of room service, then you see the food sitting there and you're left thinking \"serve it to me or I'll serve it to myself.\" I don't know if it was amplified because we sat at the table next to their prepping area - we saw this process for every diner in our back corner of the room. I can't recall ever paying such attention to the manner in which food was served. I was annoyed with the distraction.\n \nWe were on such a roll with our Restaurant Week meals I knew it was too good to last. At least, we helped out Three Square. Emeril's Fish House is a one and done experience. Frankly, it is sad that this place remains but Seablue was replaced. They had stellar seafood. I miss it."

Two stars is generous. Seriously disappointing. Emeril put his signature on a tourist trap.Honestly, pick a different restaurant."

I love experiencing a chef's vision and was really excited to finally see Emeril's come to life. We chose this spot because they had a large bar and a TV and hoped to catch some football before continuing on with our night's festivities and get some tasty bites. \n\nUnfortunately, this experience has made me think twice about not only my fixation about going to a \"mainstream\" chef's restaurant but also my admiration for Emeril. \n\nFirst, when we arrived there were two people at the bar and approximately twenty or so employees that appeared to be setting up for dinner service. The hostess up front greeted us and after explaining that we wanted to try to watch some football, suggested we sit at the bar. Perfect, so far so good. We were seated at the bar and waited....and watched as the bartenders and bar backs moved back and forth. Not one person greeted us for ten minutes...I understand that there is a certain amount of prep work required before the dinner service, but not acknowledging patrons is inexcusable. Once we finally were able to flag a bartender, we politely asked if we would be able to switch the channel on the TV to one that showed the game. The bartender said that he would have to ask the other patrons if that was fine which made sense but he was so dismissive that it automatically got my defenses up. Apparently, we were bothering him by asking him to change the channel on the TV. There were only two other patrons at the bar and thought that it wouldn't be an issue, but apparently it was for this bartender. Luckily, he made himself useful and actually got the channel changed but not after asking the other patrons which were more than obliging but then he told us that he would have to ask his manager...huh? Five minutes previous, he said that if the other patrons were OK with it then he would change it...now, we had to wait for his manager to approve? I thought restaurants were all about hospitality seeing that their business is contingent upon their patrons happiness and satisfaction. It was clear how our dinner experience was going to be after this....\n\nSo, we did this dance for about twenty minutes until we were asked what we wanted to order....He got the gnocchi and I ordered the Sea Bass....I inquired about an ingredient in the Sea Bass that I wasn't familiar with and instead of telling me he didn't know what it was, the bartender made up some lame answer about the ingredient. He told me it was something like a \"crustini\". I'm no trained chef, but I know my way around a kitchen and have a good concept about tastes and ingredients. Not being satisfied with his answer, I googled it and low and behold, it was NOTHING like a crustini but an ingredient that included pork....huh? Do the servers in this place not know anything about the food? What a wasted disappointment. And unfortunately, we can't agree with the Banana Cream Pie either....bake sale banana cream pie would've be comparable. \n\nWorst service that we have experienced in a very long time. To be housed at the great MGM Grand, I would've expected better. I think we would've had a better experience at the food court. \n\nThe food was passable.....not good...not great and definitely what I would've expected from Emeril. I'm not going to waste more time and energy by going on a continued rant but I will say that every minute I sat in Emeril's establishment was a waste of my life. \n\nThe BFF's two cents on the experience? \"Douchy bartenders, slow service, no eye contact, food was meh, banana cream pie lacked flavor-tasted nothing like cream and overpriced\". Sums it up completely,"

The gumbo was average, I've had much better before at other places. The crab melt appetizer was disgusting- I ordered it based on the recommendation of the waitress. It is crab in some mayonnaise like sauce that you are supposed to spread on these crostinis that they give you. The sauce didn't taste very good- too sweet- and the crab tasted fishy. \n\nOverall, the only redeeming thing about the meal was the famous banana cream pie. I overheard the waitress telling other people that some people go here just to have that alone. I was thinking- what a great idea- that is what I should have done! So keep it in mind."

The wait staff was top notch from start to finish, not only were they all super attentive but also very informative about everything on the menu. I planned our first anniversary dinner here as a married coulpe because my husband is orginally from Louisana and it did not dissapoint. We each ordered a bowl of soup before our meal, the clam chowder for my other half and gumbo for the creole in me. And we both were pleased on both our choices. I spiced mine up with a little Tabasco sauce and it was delish. I knew I wanted seafood for my main course here but  all the choices were endless and had a hard time deciding. I pointed out the surf n turf to my husband and we both planned on ordering the same dish. Our waiter pointed out that part of our check would be donated to one of Emeril's Foundations because this dish was created for this menu. The steak was as big as the plate and perfectly cooked. It was the most tender and flavorful steak we have ever had and you could forget the A1 sauce tonight because here it is not needed.  I have never had a dry aged steak before in my life and no im hooked. It was served with a pile of blue crab maded potatoes and grilled asaragus, which were all done perfectly. Then we decided to order the banana cream pie as it is the most requested for dessert and no disapointments here. Real whipped cream, fresh banana slices (not brown, a stand up pudding and a crust that was super flakey. I enjoyed a glass of Moscato wine from Nivole to end the night. All in all this was the best dinner date that we have ever been on and would love to come back here next time were in Las Vegas. Hats off to the staff and chef's here again :)"

Emeril's fits exactly into that category-- the food was solid, but the service was a bit spotty.  \n\nI dined with a family friend of mine who had just returned from a trip to Alaska.

            "review": "Mmmmm. Went here for dinner on one of our last nights in Vegas. I'd never been to a Emeril restaurant, so i was pretty excited. (and after reading all the yelp reviews about the banana cream pie....)\n\nWe were seated and handed a wine list...no...make that a wine novel. We were instructed that if we wanted wines by the glass, to turn to page 52. No lie.  This was a little daunting, so we just went with sodas. To start, we shared a blue crab bake that came with creole spiced crostinis. My husband is still drooling over this. I'm afraid to mention it again in case for fear of him packing his bags and flying back to Vegas just to get some. It was THAT good. \n\nFor an entree he got the tamarind glazed pork medallions that came with some stuffing and on top of a little dollop of sweet potato puree. I had a bite, and it was so good.\n\nI had the Ribeye steak, which came with a side of mashed potato. It was cooked some sort of \"emeril's special\" steak sauce. It was very very good. \n\nLast  but not least, the desserts. Our waiter started walking over with the dessert menu, and i said no thank you, i don't need a menu, i'll have the banana cream pie. It was probably the most scrumptious thing i've ever eaten. (well, dessert wise, anyhow). My husband got the s'more tart, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nOur waiter, Doug, was very attentive and an overall nice guy. Also, I bought a tshirt (gotta get some emeril-abilia) and it wasn't rediculously priced like i thought-- only 9.99! Thanks Emeril!"

The pizza tasted like one of those 5 dollar pizzas you get from the grocery store.  Actually it was worse.  The dough was unpleasant.  I took one bite and didn't even want a second one.\n\nThe shrimp aren't on the menu and I enjoyed them even though my friend thought they were terrible.\n\nI dont know...I guess I was just really dissappointed.

I just wish the table bread was more suitable for soaking up that great sauce.\nFALL RIVER CLAM CHOWDER: sounds pretty basic right? This wasn't my choice, but it ended up being one of my favorite dishes. BF called it the best clam chowder he can remember. Great creaminess, punch of seafood flavor, really comforting.\nSHRIMP, OKRA, AND ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE GUMBO: The main dish I was looking forward to, but underwhelmed by. I've had a lot of gumbo in my day and this one was solid but not the awesomeness I anticipated. Good subtle build-up of heat, lots of sausage, good value. \nALLIGATOR MEATBALLS: I've had alligator before, and I don't dislike the slight gaminess to the flavor, but I was unimpressed by the 'balls here. The creole aioli mustard was a slight drizzle, felt this dish didn't have much flavor. The most expensive dish we ordered, $4/ball, was not the same great value as the other dishes.  I wouldn't get this again.\n\nHH prices only valid in bar area, recommend seating by the raw bar to watch the chef put together seafood dishes.

We finally made it back for a happy hour & it wasn't too happy, happy this time. The service is mostly why. We rolled up to a full bar & took the last two available seats & waited to be acknowledged with a happy hour menu. Then waited some more & some more. We watched as the bar staff mixed cocktails, cleared plates, cashed out tabs etc etc & finally had one member ask if we needed a menu? Um yeah after waiting 10 minutes for any acknowledgement we were a bitt fussy & said sure... why not? I think he got the hint & grabbed some waters too. Felt like a real movie star at this point. The service vastly improved from there Thank You Sweet BABY JESUS! But in their defense so did the bar clear out as it was getting close to the end of happy hour. We ordered the for lack of correct turn the ham & cheese flat bread off the regular menu & the Fried Crystal Shrimp from the happy hour menu. I really loved the pretzel bread which staved off my eating my hubs fingers while waiting for everything to happen. The shrimp were plump, crispy & had some awesome sauce. The flat bread was there in no time. The ingredients were very fresh & tasty however the flat bread was obviously re-heated because the edges were like rock. Very disappointed with that. I expect that at Olive Garden not Emeril's not at 5:45 p.m. The drinks were the saviors. We had the French 75 & Sammy's Rum Punch & both were excellent. So what did I learn? Stick to the happy hour menu at the bar & come with the idea I'm going to be waiting at happy hour for everything...."

So hard to rate this experience, because Las Vegas is as different from New Orleans as a desert is from a bayou...\nBut I must say I was disappointed to find the d\u00e9cor in Emeril's Fish House to be so very...Vegas.  I was hoping to escape the MGM chaos for an evening of Big Easy jazz, and instead the restaurant was glitzy and glam, complete with glass walls so that the parade of attention-grabbing casino-walkers distracted from the experience all evening.\nThat being said, I can comment only on the salad, dessert, and service, since my long drive through the desert found me filling up on snacks and fast food such that I was unable to partake in an entr\u00e9e on this particular Saturday night at Emeril's.\nThe salad, a daily special with arugula, grilled mushrooms and asparagus, was subtle. A little TOO subtle. I should have passed on the black pepper, because it so overpowered the salad that I detected little other flavor.  It was mildly disappointing with what I've come to expect from Emeril.\nMy server was of course, not the top-rate personality that you would find in NOLA, but I tried to keep an open mind since the cities are so very different.  My only complaint with the waitress (other than our very different tastes as evidenced by her recommendations which I wouldn't re-order), was that she became scarce in the latter half of my meal, and I had to wait too long to order dessert, and had to order my coffee from another server I happened to flag down.\nI reallllly wanted to try the huckleberry cobbler, but the waitress raved of their signature banana cr\u00e8me pie; so I went with the dessert trio of banana cr\u00e8me, pecan pie, and bread pudding.  The bread pudding was to die for.  Or kill for.  The pecan pie was great (but I haven't met too many of those that weren't), and the banana cr\u00e8me pie was somewhat dry in my opinion. I left half on my plate.\nI'll have to go again next time I'm in town to give it my full attention, complete with entr\u00e9e. \nBut with the stiff competition in Sin City...maybe not."

It wasn't my choice and I was pretty sure it was going to be bad, but it was disgusting. Forget the service, the decor, the drinks, I'm just going to stick to reviewing the food. Stone crab claws were obviously not available so we weren't able to try those, but I'm confident they would have been gross just like everything else. We started with 2 dozen oysters, a dozen of each kind on the menu. It's pretty hard to mess up oysters, but these were dry and smelly, a clear sign that they weren't fresh. Next we ordered the chopped salad which was one of the most disgusting things I can recall having eaten in my entire life. The dressing was bland and tasted like they sprinkled some water with a touch of salt and pepper and the quality of the salad and vegetables itself was pathetic (frozen maybe???). Everything was just soggy and tasted like these rinsed everything under a faucet and plated it. I immediately sent it back and didn't bother to order anything else. For our entree we had a grilled whole white fish which was the least offensive item of the evening, but still wasn't that good and it could have been fresher and better prepared. I am typically pretty forgiving of restaurants for making a mistake or trying something that didn't quite work, but this restaurant was consistently bad every step of the way and it's clearly a place that lacks quality ingredients and staff who care about the food they cook and serve. Please please don't go here, you will be utterly disappointed. Emeril you should be ashamed to have your name on this restaurant."

There were a few at the MGM, so it was hard to decide which one to choose. It basically came down to the fact that we were starving and wanted immediate seating.\n\nNo regrets though.  For example, I never order chicken in a restaurant.  Never.  I think my local supermarkets make delicious $5 rotisserie chickens and every time I order it at a restaurant its dry.  But I'll get to that later.\n\nAtmosphere: Pleasant.  Felt a little underdressed wearing t-shirts and hoodies because there were linens on the table and the servers were well dressed.  The location of the restaurant in the reference to the hotel was just outside the food court area so it kinda felt like the restaurant was in a mall, but hey its Vegas, there's gonna be commotion wherever you go.\n\nService:  Awesome, I didn't catch our servers name, but he was attentive and wasn't overly aggressive.\n\nMenu: Being a fish house, we probably should have had something from the sea.  However my date was from Hawaii, he's got plenty of access to some fresh fish.  Besides you've got lay down a substantial foundation before drinking heavily and fish just isn't going to cut it.\n\nWine list: Absolutely phenomenal.  The list was about the size of my high school yearbook.  Holy crap.\n\nFood-Appetizer-braised short rib and polenta: Good stuff, but at this point we were starving, so who knows?  There was a baked crust on the polenta and the short rib was nice and tender.\n\nFood-Chicken: I had the lemon herb chicken and it was juicy, but of course I attacked the dark meat and was too full to finish the breast.  I want to attack with my hands, but had to knife and fork it due to the classiness of this place.  My entree came accompanied with a wilted frisee salad, which really isn't my thing.  Ate all the tomatoes though.  There was a potato gratin that was crusted with gruyere.  The cheese was good, but I kinda felt like potatoes were a little al dente for my taste.\n\nDate's Food-Pork porterhouse:  Who knew such a cut even existed?  Pork is another thing that I never order because it's usually overdone.  It was a little pink in the middle and was actually really good.  I think there was some apple reduction sauce, but to be honest I was too involved with my chicken and wine to really investigate his dish.  Besides he looked like he was enjoying his dish.  The last thing I'd want to do is interrupt a man while he's eating.  \n\nOverall experience: Awesome.  Would I return?  Don't think I'll be returning to Vegas anytime soon.  Besides there are a million in one restaurants there...so there's really no need to eat at the same one twice."

We have been to NOLA in New Orleans and absolutely fell in love with it so we had high hopes. Initially we were pretty impressed, but by the end of the meal it was a disaster. Here is the low-down:\n\nI started with the spinach, nectarine, and blackberry salad with maple buttermilk dressing. This was a sophisticated take on a Southern summer salad. It was delicious and well balanced; I really enjoyed it! My husband had the heirloom tomato, jalapeno cornbread, and avocado salad. It was also pretty good, but the cornbread croutons were oversized and completely overtook everything else in the salad. \n\nNext, I had the clam chowder which was so creamy and perfectly balanced. The potatoes were just a touch undercooked, I am not sure if this was intentional or not, but it was a nice touch that added a little bite to the dish. My husband had the gumbo. The gumbo was at first bite underwhelming, but the more you ate the better it got. There was a nice touch of heat that continued to build with each bite.\n\nEverything up to this point was good, but the moment our entrees hit the table I was concerned. I chose the pecan crusted trout, which is served with the head on and with a giant bed of slaw on top of it. It is not a visually appealing dish in the least, in fact I didn't even want to eat it. The moment I took a bite I immediately regretted it as it was so aggressively salted that I almost spit it out. It was borderline inedible and the slaw on top had absolutely no flavor and added nothing to the dish. It was one of the weirdest things I have ever been served. My husband had the scallops and baby back ribs, what a weird combination in the first place! I am not a fan of scallops so I won't even go there, but the baby back ribs had a bit of a sweetness to them and weren't too bad. I ate some of those and pushed my fish to the middle of the table. The waiter took the queue and asked if he could bring me something else, I turned him down because at this point I was getting full anyway and we still had dessert!\n\nI had to try the banana cream pie for dessert and was expecting a fluffy, creamy cloud. Dessert was probably my favorite course in New Orleans, so I again had high hopes. Unfortunately, there was nothing creamy about the banana cream pie. It was so thick and almost entirely made of slices of bananas that it was more like a bad version of banana cheesecake. I took 2 bites and wanted to throw my hands up in the air and scream, come on Emeril I know you can do better than that! \n\nOverall, we were pretty disappointed. The service was fantastic, but the trout was probably one of the worst dishes I have ever been served and dessert was such a let down. I know that Emeril can make amazing food, I've had the pleasure of eating it, so what is going on here?"

Other than cupcakes, I think fish is way up there in the \"in love\" department.  It's healthy and when cooked well, it's divine!\n\nOur stay in Las Vegas was about to be filled with numerous celebratory activities and to start off or long weekend of shenanigans we, oy, the birthday girl ;o) , chose Emeril's New Orleans Fish House for her birthday.  We arrived on time and were seated promptly, albeit next to the kitchen, but promptly. \n\nIt was nice a fancy here, a wee bit more fancy than anticipated, yet we kept our optimism on high ground.  This was a good and a not so good thing.  As our order were taken and waters were being brought out, and the bread, we were already famished.  Granted, we were a large party and the waiters were doing their best to attend to tables as fast as they could, we couldn't help but notice a few of our table's missing waters several times throughout our dining experience.  It took awhile for our appetizers to come, but when it did, we were delighted.  Like some other reviews have stated, the calamari was pretty delicious.   And I'm not particularly a calamari fan.  \n\nOur meals finally got to comin' and I went the safe route: salmon.  It was no ordinary salmon though, it was Emeril's Barbecued Salmon with andouille & potato hash - crispy onion crust - Emeril's Worcestershire sauce:  $32 .\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og?select=85w_lWKGU8buRpmWaaLuQg\n \n I really did enjoy this dish, and so did the bf.  He and his bro ordered this pasta which they loved.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og?select=SVLhDRMNBQ8xqPhX2WTtPg\nDessert:  My BF and I ordered the Butterscotch creme brulee with two sugar cookies. This was the highlight of our dinner! It was just marvelous! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og?select=-8VEbYBrsB1nR6AgMVfWcg\nSo the three stars doesn't come from the food, it was definitely delicious.  A bit pricey, well no, it WAS pricey for what we got, but it was good.  It unfortunately goes to the service.  The MIA water refills for some of our party, and the very very long wait to find our waiter so we can pay our bill.  That was a little bit of a downer too.  The food is worth trying here, perhaps I would come for lunch though, so I won't be breaking my bank account and wishing I bought a new dress instead of an expensive dinner. \n\n*side note: they do give a little somethin' somethin' for someone who is there to celebrate a birthday.

We were running late for lunch and decided to sit at the bar and get something to eat.... Big Mistake....\n\nWhen we sat we were the 3rd party to sit at the bar.  We waited at least 7 minutes to even get acknowledged and be given menus.  I knew we were off to a bad start, but we hung in there for more abuse.  \n\nMore guests started sitting and the next thing you knew - the bar was pretty full with over 25 guests sitting at the bar all waiting to be serviced.  The really retarded part of this deal was there was only ONE bartender trying to service the 25 people.... H E L L O....\n\nThere were 4 servers standing on the side talking, a host and a manager taking at the podium and another manager in a suit talking to the servers.  What kind of team work is this???  The poor bartender was doing his best, but the guy was clearly overwhelmed.  \n\nWhen the food runners bring the food out, they just drop it at the bar and don't help out by placing it in front of the guest.  The food sits at the bar as the bartender is busy and can't get to the food to deliver it to the guests.  So retarded and ridiculous.  This is really poor service.  The managers are really good for nothing - why are they not helping out to insure their guests get good service???The managers still did not help out when the bar was full of people - No one helped out.  Unbelievable.  It was stressful watching the bartender - i wanted to get up and help the poor guy.  \n\nWe ordered a chowder and a gumbo.  To our surprise the bartender whips it up himself and serves the soup from inside the bar.  Strange....There is 2 soup terrines in the bar - one for chowder and the other is gumbo.  Of course, the soup is not poured nicely - there are spills on the side of the dish and he whipped the bowls in front of us.  I would think the Chef would at least like to service the soup.  Not nice at all.  Soup was okay, but the gumbo at Table 10 at the Palazzo was much better.\n\nI think all the cooks, except for one, stays after 2p, as the rest of the food was bad.  Definitely not what you would expect from Emeril.  Sad in fact...  The ceviche was poorly seasoned and tasted awful.  \n\nThe sausage sliders were okay and the frog legs were mediocre.  Overall a really bad experience.  I will never go to this location again.  Too many other places to spend my money."

I would like to say that the reason I'm scoring this restaurant so low was just because of the hectic and very unorganized service. Could be attributed to the preparation for their party in the evening. But the food was also just very poor. After waiting forty minutes, we started with oysters which were not prepared correctly and the wedge salad, which lacked flavor entirely. I then had the BBQ shrimp which were overcooked and came with nothing else but a tiny, silver dollar size hard biscuit. My husband had the crusted tuna/ahi sand witch. The fish was awful, mushy, cut incorrectly and lacked flavor. Even if the service had been better, I still would not recommend this restaurant and won't be eating here again. Big disappointment."

We didn't give this place much thought because as much as I love seafood, my boyfriend can't stand it. Luckily they offered steak and a burger entree so he was okay with it. Even luckier, they were able to seat us within 15 minutes. We had two waitresses and like three other people waiting on us (removing corn bread baskets, emptying plates and refilling water) it was kind of confusing and I could tell my boyfriend was getting annoyed by the constant refilling of water and the fact that the waitress didn't mention the beer he was getting was non-alcoholic even though he asked what the percentage of alcohol was (it should've been on the menu). I almost gave my first 5 star rating if it weren't for these little discrepancies. My boyfriend got the all American Angus burger which he said was decent. I got the seafood pan roast which consisted of chef's selection of fish medallions, mussels and gulf shrimp, seafood and andouille pork sausage jambalaya with lemon butter sauce. OH MY GOODNESS. Best combination of seafood I've ever had. The fish (I don't even know what kind of fish it was) melted in my mouth. Everything was seasoned perfectly and I enjoyed every single bite. The wait was well worth it and I'm happy we randomly ended up here. It was the seafood God's will."

It was a fine experience, thankfully devoid of the man himself, but I wasn't blown away.\n\nHusband really liked his gumbo, with spicy, smoky andouille.  My oyster and rock shrimp po' boy -- which wasn't listed on the menu, but the waiter mentioned I could combine the two options if I so desired in a sandwich cleverly named, \"The Peacemaker.\" -- was quite good.  Light, crunchy cornmeal batter, *tons* of fresh, lovely seafood, and a chewy, crunchy-exteriored homemade baguette.  But they were accompanied by a bag (literally, they were still in the celo) of Zapp's Tabasco chips.  You can't make your own, Emeril?  I get they're a Gulf Coast delicacy, but they just seemed out of place at this semi-swank eatery next to my $16 sandwich.\n\nMy dining companions weren't as lucky with their meals.  Two ordered the flank steak salads with medium-rare meat -- but the meat was *so* rare it was practically mooing.  Another ordered a burger medium-rare, and encountered the opposite problem.  It was *so* cooked air escaped when she bit into it.  She sent it back only to have the second one come out with a pulse.  Sent it back for round three, and it finally came out right.  Dinner rolls before the meal were totally dry and tasted like they'd just been picked up at the grocery store in the day-old section.\n\nAt the recommendation (repeated insistence) of a friend, tho, we tried the banana cream pie.  Ridiculous.  The best thing we ate.  By far.\n\nCocktails were good, ambiance pleasant, and our server was great -- really personable and chatty, and quite attentive.

My friend had the grilled ahi tuna with heirloom tomatoes she mentioned to our waiter that she was allergic to tomatoes and asked if something else can be substituted for it.

Thankfully, she was only allergic to fresh tomatoes and not the cooked so was still able to have it  which she said was delicious.  The tuna however was a little salty (they gave her a salad instead) without the tomatoes, but she was thankful at the fact that the waiter cared enough to check on the food allergy.\r\nOverall the rest of the entrees that we had were decent at best.

As we went through the rest of the meal (I'll edit the review and post the menu, but I don't have it in front of me right now) our servers introduced each wine and each course with confidence.  They really knew a lot about the wines and how they complimented each course.\n\nEverything tasted amazing, except for the striped sea bass with gnocci and red wine braised leeks.  The sea bass tasted amazing by itself, but was overpowered by a gorgonzola sauce and fresh tomato paste.  The leaks were grey/pink and the gnocci was gray and bland.  As a whole the dish was visually unappealing, lacking in texture, and the flavors were way out of balance.\n\nAfter dessert and coffee, I noticed we were the only table left in the restaurant and the Manager and Chef were sitting at the bar.  We asked for the check--we were not presented the check until we asked for it, a very nice touch considering we were lingering, sipping coffee, and conversing after every other table left."

The view from outside in unimpressive and looks more like an indoor strip mall or, dare I say, a Food Court.\n\nThe hostess was friendly and guided us to our table without issue.  We were seated near the rear of place toward the kitchen.  They have a really cool light fixture above the expo window and a see through glass to the kitchen.  The waiter comes directly to the table and laughs at me for looking toward the kitchen and says \"no he is not here\" assuming that I was looking for Emeril. But then he adds \"in fact he is never here\".  This is not my first trip to a restaurant run by a famous chef, and I was not looking for Emeril, but I am sure that this would be lost on this arrogant jerk, so I said \"oh, I was just looking at the kitchen\" to which his response was \"you can do whatever you want\".  My wife adds \"cool, can we go back and cook\" and he replied \"I am sure you wouldn't be any worse than those guys\".  I thought this was an odd statement but after the meal I realized it was an honest account of how bad the food really is here.\n\nMy wife got the baby spinach and blackberry salad.  The dish came out and was she just ate the berries and nectarines.  The dressing had absolutely no flavor so the spinach was ruined,  The dish just didn't seem to come together; however, it was miles better than the heirloom tomato and avocado salad that was placed in front of me.  This flop of a dish was nothing more than a poor way for the kitchen to reuse yesterday's stale cornbread, I picked through the tomatoes and avocado and left 85% of the dish in tact.  The waiter cleared the plate away without asking any questions.\n\nFor the next course, i decided to take a chance and try the trio of chilled summer soups.  I am usually not a fan of cold soup, but with Emeril's reputation of nailing flavors, I thought this might be an interesting way for the kitchen to show off some cajun flavor.  I was wrong.  The tangy tomato soup was gross.  The avocado lime was palatable but boring.  The roasted pepper soup (that had Emeril's initial on it) tasted like sink water after soaking red bell peppers.  \n\nMy main course arrived and the meat was cold, all four little strips of meat on the plate.  Of course this was no surprise because of the odd service style of this place.  The food runners take food only as far as the servers area then your food just sits and waits for you.  So we sat ten feet from our food and basically watched it get cold.  The meat sat atop a small mountain of oddly fried potatoes that were rubbery as though they had been fried yesterday and reheated.\n\nThe bread pudding was more like a bowl of day old Quaker oats that had congealed.  I took some of the chocolate shavings from the banana cream pie topping and rescued this disaster of dessert.  For a chef that is known for kicking flavors \"up a notch\"  this place was several notches below acceptable."

Started with a Seafood & Andouille pork sausage with shrimp and steamed rice. Jut what a Gumbo should be, thick and flavorful. The dish has that cajun bite that adds just enough kick but not to make you scream for a glass of water. Josie had the Tuscan Kale Salad with Raisin Vinaigrette, toasted Pecans and Queso Mahon Cheese. She stated kale was crisp and fresh vinaigrette had a good flavor no long aftertaste.\n\n Second course. Josie had the seared scallops with Bacon, corn summer vegetable succotash with a herb caper butter sauce. I had a bite of these and they were melt in your mouth good. perfectly cooked and the succotash was flavorful. I had Fisheman's stew. Littleneck Clams, Mussels and Shrimp. I was not impressed with the dish and was hoping for more sauce. Had a crustini for dipping but with the lack of sauce it seemed pointless. I know it is a stew but the overabundance of stewed tomatoes took away from the overall taste.\n\nDessert. Bread and butter pudding and Banana Cream Pie. The bread pudding has this flavor you want, a buttery melt in your mouth without the mush taste that some bread puddings offer. Small Banana cream pie square with whipped topping, chocolate shavings and caramel sauce. Great ending dessert adding a touch of soft flavor after the spices we had in the meal itself.\n\nOverall a good dinner. Not sure if I will be back. They did offer a wine tasting for 20 dollars that sounded nice if we had the fortitude for that on this evening. 3 stars for tonight. Ambiance was not great and noise was loud. I know it is a prix fix menu but I have seen better efforts on restaurant week that would make me want to return and try a full menu pairing. Again I don't get the $4.50 a glass for a diet drink. Hope someone can tell me why this is a restaurant pricing standard in Vegas. Again my glass was never empty, bonus there. Staff was attentive and present when needed. Maybe I have high hopes for a restaurant put together by a star like Emeril. So 2 seafood places this restaurant week and RM Seafood would be the winner."

What a rip off.  In New York a 15 dollar salad gives you 5 times the portion of this.  Service was super slow.  Took over 1 hr to get that Caesar salad which obviously takes much preparation.   If you want to pay a lot for low quality, please make this the first restaurant of your choice at MGM grand."

The food was to die for and the service was exceptional!  I just can't say enough.  \n\nI had the halibut, it was cooked perfectly and my mouth still waters thinking about it!   We tried a few appitizers and our servers brought us a free appitizer of Ahi Tuna w/some sort of peanut butter sauce and some sort of wasabi somthing - sounds strange but it is soooo good!  \n\nNow, besides the food - the service was great!  I think the servers names were Anthony (or Antonio, really wish I could remember) and Rocky.  They did such a great job.  They were very attentive and answered our questions quickly.  My glass was never empty and I loved that we were all served at exactly the same time, like they brought out 3 extra people each placing the plate at the same time (sounds silly, but it made for a fun experience).  All this and it was a crazy busy Saturday night."

Having been to New Orleans many times and throughout the South for Cajun an Southern food the food fell short of our \"best we've ever had expectations. Honestly, this was one notch up from the Cheesecake Factory, not alongside Brennan's, etc. And, at $200 for three people (our bill) it needs to be better. If the bill was $125 I would have given in a 5-star. But, if you are going to charge a premium, we better leave telling stories about how good it was. \n\nAnd, again, the food was darn good, just not best we've ever had. Not even close, in fact. The three of us travel more than often for work and have eat much, much better, for far, far less. \n\nThe apps, were pretty good. The Cajun BBQ Shrimp was tasty and the sauce it came in was good. The calamari wasn't tender, wasn't greasy and we demolished it. In fact, both were fairly priced. \n\nTwo of us went with the Pecan crusted redfish, which was well done. Is it the best redfish I've ever had? Not even close, but it was good and the fixings came in strong, too. I've had much better redfish (for half the price) on the Gulf Coast, however, but we also need to take into account that this is Vegas and it costs a bundle for rent here. Still, the flavor could have been a notch higher. \n\nI personally didn't eat the pork chops. A friend did. He was thrilled with the portions and flavor, but mentioned it was a 3.5 not a 5. (And, he's had that dish at similar priced spots across the US. \n\nThe biggest letdown came with dessert. I ordered the pecan pie, which I'm a huge fan of and the pecan pie I've had at Pappadaux (a lower priced chain) blew this away. The crust was great, but the pie tasted like it was just thawed."

The fish was cooked to a juicy heavenly perfection and coated in a fantastic crust of pecans on a bed of grilled veggies and topped with crispy potato stings. They have different variations of this dish in a few of the other places.

The hostess informed me that HH is only at the bar and they didn't have servers for the tables (my little girl is six and can't sit at the bar,which I totally agree) \nI asked her to see what she could do, if not we would go elsewhere ...no biggie , but I had to feed my hungry kid ASAP. She came back and said the bartender wound serve us at a table....yay\nMy princess ordered Parmesan truffle fries....yum\nWe had a slider trio (pulled pork.) and it came with amazing slaw\nAnd of course I had to have the shiishito peppers...I think there was a Hugh percentage of fire ones.\nI had the French 75 to drink x2 ...soooo good\nThey bartender even loaded my daughters water with cherries so her drink would look like mummy's.\n\nVery happy all around.  We didn't finish everything so they boxed it up and we had a delish snack later on"

My favorite drinks are the Bam Drop and Sammy's Rum Punch.  For food I like the clam chowder, gumbo and fried shrimp.  They have scaled back the happy hour menu recently.  They have taken off the fried oysters and bbq shrimp which were my fave.  Service is usually good but have had a few hiccups.  Issac the bar manager is wonderful.

They are some of the most courteous servers that I've ever encountered. \n\nA group of 4 friends and I during our first trip to Vegas, made this our grand dinner location and that it was. From the amazing appetizers to our fabulous entrees of succulent red fish, and scrumptious steaks, to mouth water shrimp and scallops, everything was perfect. This is some of the most seasoned and well-flavored food I've ever tasted. You won't be disappointed. Each dish is made with such care and every plate is distinct with it's own sense of flavors and personality. \n\nI live in New York City and have frequented many restaurants of the culinary bad boys, Batali, Flay, Morimoto, and Lagasse; and this is definitely one of those great restaurants that puts Emeril on that list. \n\n**Deal Seeking Diva tip** Secure yourself a reservation. You can do this even before you head to Vegas. Check out OpenTable.com and book your reservation. You can do this months or even days before you come to make sure you secure a spot at one of the most sought after tables."

Next I had herb crusted sea bass with potatoes and green beans. The different textures and blending of flavors made it very clear to me that this was the reason Emeril is a master chef. The entree portion was pretty large. With tip, my bill came to $52. It was a little pricey for lunch, but well worth the quality and experience."

As far as the food goes, we will definitely be back.  The salmon was done perfectly - I asked for mine to be cooked on the drier side.  There was just enough barbecue sauce - not too overpowering.  Dessert was beignets with chcolate orange sauce - didnt like the dipping sauce, but that's just me.  Wonderful restaurant!"

I made a couple notes about this in my reservation I requested two glasses of champagne at our table.\n\nWhen we arrived at the hostess she welcomed us and wished us a happy anniversary.  We were seated at a booth table which was very nice.  The waitstaff came with the two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary.  He was very kind and let us know that he was going to be working with a team to serve us for the night.  \n\nThey served us complimentary salmon tar tar appetizers as another special note for our anniversary.  Emeril's did a tremendous job making us feel special and truly making the night a romantic one.  I selected Emeril's because it has a New Orleans influence.  I had the gumbo which was phenomenal.  The presentation is great as they bring out a bow with rice and a hot pot with the gumbo in it.  They pour the hot gumbo into your bowl right in front of your eyes.  Really nice.  I don't remember what the name of the seafood plate I had was but it was very good.  \n\nTo finish of the night we go dessert and they presented it by again wishing us a happy anniversary.  It wasn't only that they kept the theme of the night but they truly cared about our night and seemed genuinely interested in our night.  Emeril's is a personal experience that has service that outdoes any other that I have ever had. \n\nThanks Emeril's and I look forward to coming back when I am back in Vegas."

The BBQ Shrimp is supposed to be a specialty of the restaurant--think peanut butter BBQ on slightly tough shrimp, and you get the idea--perhaps other people like that, but it's not my taste.\n\nKeep looking if you're after a special restaurant while in Vegas."

My guess is that people who aren't from areas boasting fresh, abundant seafood might believe the fish they serve here to be \"delicious.\"  The atmosphere tried wayyyyyy too hard to be chic without delivering (not unique menu offerings, nor inspired cocktails).  The appetizers were a joke!  We ordered the shrimp and were presented with 3 for approximatley $18 .  They weren't particularly special...grilled with overpoweringly spicey sauce.  I ordered a bowl of the fish stew (bland city) and a side of calamari (mostly tenticles). My order, without drinks or tax or tip, came to about $65 .  No one in the group enjoyed their meal.  For about $100/person, you could enjoy a much finer vegas dining establishment."

Had a reservation, so table was ready immediately, or should I say tables; they split our party into two tables of 7...There was enough room for 20 people at one of those tables, I spread my arms out fully in both directions and did not touch either neighbor. Hostess did not make any attempt to change the arrangement. Restaurant was dead, I think we were one of only 5 tables at 12:30. One waiter brought us water, 15 min later a diff waiter brought us 1 cocktail menu for 2 tables to share...10 min later 4 people of our group walked out since the service was so slow, so we consolidated to 1 single table. After about 30-45 min our drinks were served and he took our order. The food was pretty awful. We're from Texas and spend plenty of time in NOLA, so we know what the food was supposed to taste like...The only decent dish was the oysters, but that's pretty hard to screw up. How can you make red beans and rice so awful?! The chicken was probably tossed into a pot of boiling water and then drizzled with so-so bbq sauce. For over $400 we expected, at least, decent service and decent food. I never complain and this time I felt like I had to, the manager did nothing. We finally escaped at almost 3 PM. I have no idea why the service was slow, it was absolutely dead in there. I really shrunk this down, but needless to say not 1 single person from our group was happy. It was a huge disappointing way to follow a once in a lifetime occasion. Never ever again. Not even the one in NOLA. Don't waste your time or your money. What a let down, Emeril."

We ordered the menu set for both my husband and me, with the wine pairing for him, and a delicious mojito for me. I don't know what the bartender did different with the mojito, but it was the best I ever had, and even the server told me that it was one of the best! It was a bit small, but worth every penny.\nWe started off with fried rock shrimp and picked carrots and radish (kind of an asian flavor to it) in a lettuce cup with a caviar vinaigarette. The rock shrimp was seasoned just right, and I just picked up the lettuce cup and ate the whole thing like a wrap. Both the hubby and I loved it. \nThen we had a broiled oyster that was not so good. It was cooked with a creamy sauce with onions, the sauce was good, but I hit a chunk of shell on my first bite, and that ruined it for me. \nThe pan cooked salmon on a black-eyed peas/yams salad was okay. The salmon was a little tough, but the crunchy salad had an interesting texture and tangy flavor to it that added a few points to the fish.\nThe black cod with mixed mushrooms and a wheat-berry vegetable melange was awesome. The mixed mushrooms were cooked together in a sherry or wine sauce, yet retained their individual flavors. The cod was tender and went with the sides quite well.\nThe filet was juicy but the shrimp on top was a little over-seasoned. The bleu cheese was a nice touch, but you have to be careful to taste just a teensy bit with the food, or it easily overpowers the meat.\nThe dessert, bread pudding with warm cream and whisky reduction was heaven. When I told the server the bread pudding was awesome, he smiled and confessed that it was his favorite of all times.\n\nThe husband liked the wine pairing, though most of it were white wines (for the seafood), and he's not a fan of white wines."

With the exception of my brother's cooking, it feels like months since the last time I had a meal this delicious. \n\nNot wanting to set myself up for disappointment, my expectations were fairly low. No one really seemed excited about this place, and Emeril's appeal has sort of worn off. But our entire experience here was outstanding. We came at 10:00pm, and frankly, I'm glad we were here late, although it was still quite busy when we first arrived. \n\nI liked the inside of the restaurant. Due to the high ceiling and the way the tables were set up, it created an illusion of intimacy and spaciousness, even though there were quite a few people there. (Chihuly is everywhere, I can't escape him!)\n\nOur server was such a kick. We didn't get any Emeril schtick from her, just genuine New Orleans service (she was from there). She was so attentive and kind, she even took us by the arm to escort us to the restrooms. \n\nShe did a fantastic job of explaining the menu and pointing out the notable dishes. Vince and I went with the tasting menu, while the others weren't quite so hungry.\n\nI have to say that this was right up there with the best tasting menus I've ever had, but what really blew me out of the water was the perfection of the wine pairings. Every single last one of them was brilliant.\n\nFor your drooling pleasure, our meal consisted of:\n- Achiote marinated & grilled jumbo gulf shrimp w/mixed baby green & orange segments tossed in a cumin vinaigrette, toasted pine nuts and queso tetilla; paired with a Spanish white.\n- Seared Maine sea scallop with caramelized onion & sweet potato bread pudding w/ bacon braised southern greens and apple brandy reduction; paired with a New Zealand chard.\n- Sweet BBQ Atlantic salmon on a homemade andouille sausage and Brabant potato hash w/ spicy onion crust and Emeril's homemade Worcestershire sauce; paired with an Oregon pinot.\n- Pecan crusted mahi mahi with grilled vegetables, stone ground grits and creole meuniere butter sauce; paired with a California sangiovese.\n- Grilled filet of beef on lobster & sweet corn risotto with sauteed haricot vert and charred tomato reduction; paired with a Washington merlot. \n- Tiramusu, paired with a vintage port, which we subbed out for another dessert wine that I don't remember.\n\nAll of this deliciousness was only $70, plus $50 for the wine pairing. I think that's pretty reasonable for what we got, plus it's about the same as what we paid for similar tasting menus in Sonoma County. The tasting menus at the other restaurants at the MGM were all much, much more than that (but also of a much higher caliber, I suppose). \n\nLike Vince mentioned in his review, it's pretty incredible that they were able to come up with wine pairings for a lot of these dishes, since there is such a crazy mix of flavors (the salmon in particular), but not only did they pull it off, they did it very well. \n\nI slowed down toward the end and took most of my steak to go. I was thrilled when I ate it the next day for lunch and it was so tender and bloody, just the kind of perfect steak I've been craving, and that lobster risotto with it was delicious. \n\nI would definitely come here again, plus I want to check out some of these other tasty looking restaurants at the MGM. \n\nSumming up: Awesome.\n\n--11/15/06 update--\nToday in the mail I got a handwritten note from our server thanking us for our visit and inviting us back again. A simple gesture, but much appreciated!"

When we got our meal I was so disappointed that  I tad to send it back.  They offered us another meal but we refused.  The main reason is that the service had been less than gracious, in an almost empty restaurant we were seated at the service entrance.  I had made Reservations  2 months in advance.  After we sent our meals back we left an appropriate tip and left."

            "review": "We went to Emeril's for lunch with the idea of splitting a salad, having some gumbo, and basically making dessert our main course.  The salad was fresh and we were given an adequate portion.  The salad dressing was good without being overwhelming.  Next we ordered the gumbo (being where we were it seemed like the thing to order) which was good even though the portions were not anything to write home about.  Next came dessert.  We were planning on each ordering the banana cream pie but the waiter talked us into an order of banana cream pie and an order of bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  We shared them and they were both awesome.  Then the waiter brought us three different flavors of sorbet on the house that were outstanding.   I know we did not try anything really challenging but I was completely satisfied with the service and the food and definitely would go back again."

I waited a full year to have it again, so I was disappointed that it wasn't in the menu anymore. I got a stuffed Iobster dish instead... It was good, but not what I'd waited a year for. I also had issues with cork being in all of our wine... even when they took it back to try again... Twice!\nIf I had reviewed for my first visit it would've been 5 stars, but my most recent visited bumps it down to 3."

            "review": "Disappointing client dinner. In short: fantastic appetizers, disappointing main courses, horrible service. I expected much more, especially after my experience with Emeril's restaurant in New Orleans. 2 stars for appetizers and desserts. \n\nWe at at Emeril's New Orleans Fish House on 4/14 to entertain clients. We were seated immediately - next to the kitchen door (disappointment #1). After we were seated, we ordered cocktails. It took 40 minutes to get our cocktails. It really stalled the conversation, sitting at the table with just our water, waiting for anyone to stop back by the table. \n\nOnce the cocktails arrived, we ordered appetizers. Those took about 20 minutes to come out of the kitchen. We had:\nShrimp Cocktail - delicious\nBay Scallop Ceviche - amazing.\nOysters on the half shell - good.\nAlligator meatballs - good.\n\nThe entrees came out faster than we expected but it still took a while. I'll give the servers credit, they did remove our plates promptly. :/\n\nEntrees:\nSeafood Pan Roast - disappointing - small amount of seafood, loaded with \"filler\"\nTexas Redfish - good.\nShellfish Pasta - Disappointing- no flavor. \n\nThere were a few other entrees but they were not noteworthy. \n\nThe desserts were amazing, though! We tried 4 different desserts and they were all amazing. \n\nOverall, I would never go back unless we are only eating appetizers. Our entire meal took 3 hours. THREE HOURS."

It was pretty empty and although the HH says at the bar only, there were so many tables we asked if we could sit at the table with the HH menu and they happily said yes.\n\nComp starter, cornbread. Which was DRY and overly toasted on the outside. Must've been sitting out there for a while. I was excited for them but just had one and already felt sad. \n\n**From the HH menu: \n\n-PORK BELLY SLIDERS (3): TERRIBLE, one of the three was 80% fat not to mention they were still too tough to bite through. As you pull it back, it would fall apart. \n\n-SHRIMP AND SAUSAGE GUMBO: MEH. Major okra slime, salty, forgettable, shrimp was a mush as soon as you bite it. Another disappointment. \n\n-4 Oysters $6: average, not freshly sweet as it should be. \n\n**NON-HH menu: \n\n-LOBSTER ROLL $23. WORST LOBSTER ROLL i have ever had. Full mayonase, zero lobster flavor, presentation subpar (see picture). \n\nService was great, too bad it doesn't match the food. \n\nI would not recommend this place. Please go to PUB 1842 which is ten steps from here and have a decent meal there."

Of course they are never around to manage quality control as they are busy doing their shows on Food Network and endorsing overpriced merchandise.\n\nLet's just say I don't remember what I ordered but do remember that it was fish (mahi mahi I think) and it was very dry and the sides were overcooked and dull in color. The service was polite and quick. More than anything, I remember the fun conversation and boisterous laughs I had with my friends and family."

No salmon, no catfish, no hush puppies...UGH. We both got the seafood salad with jambalaya and collards as sides.  I didn't recognize some of the seafood in the salad...they claimed it was from a lobster, but it wasn't a tail or claw or legs...hhhmmm...looked like intestines.   $4.50 for ice tea...UGH.  Very salty pretzel bread.  We won't be back."

Unfortunately we had neither at this location.  We went for brunch on Sunday and the menu was very limited.  When I really didn't see what I wanted, I asked if they could just make an omelette.  I don't eat wheat or dairy and this seemed the easiest way to accomplish this.  They told me they couldn't do it.  What high end restaurant can't make an omelette?(I can make one so they should be able to since I saw all the ingredients in other dishes on the menu).  So I was left to order the crab and shrimp in lettuce cups, no sauce.  There was supposed to be avocado on it, but that was missing too.  very tasteless.  My husband's braised hash was just OK-nothing special.  We had eaten at Buchon in Beverly Hills a couple weeks before and the hash there was so much better.  Really disappointing when we know the experience could have been so much more."

Service was very polite and friendly, but the kitchen was painfully slow. 3 different kinds of oysters but our waiter couldn't tell us the difference between them. The frog legs were tasty but very oily. The crawfish and trout was really salty. My boyfriend got the ribeye fillet and couldn't finish more than a few bites because the reduction was way too rich and pungent. \n\nBest part were the pretzel rolls, wasn't worth a $140 bill"

We had a planned to order a little bit of everything but when the appetizers came...they were marginal at best and we couldn't bring ourselves to order anything else.  The clam chowder tasted like it was out of a can!  There was no garnish and how the heck could you not even put any New Orleans spices?!!??  The poke had to be returned because it was old and a manager didn't even come over to check on us after the return.  We finally just aid and went to the steakhouse next door to eat.  It was phenomenal!!!  Way to end what otherwise would have been a bad night!  Stay away from Emiril's I really think you'll be dusapo"

As amazing as that meal was, our lunch at Emeril's was just as good, and that's sayin' somethin'. My hubby had the clam chowder and I had the scallops with risotto for an appetizer. We could have split the scallops, it was a really large portion for an appy and SO DELICIOUS. I forget the type of cheese it was made with, but it was creamy with a touch of spiciness which I LOVED. I ordered the Scottish salmon with the andouille hash--again, this was spicy and sooo delicious. Hubby ordered the sea bass with orzo and I sampled his and it was excellent. The fish was cooked perfectly, everything was seasoned so wonderfully and I loved the spicy Creole heat to the dishes. By then we were so stuffed that dessert wasn't an option. This was my favorite meal of our Las Vegas trip. The only complaint was that since it was lunchtime, the waiter was a little too intrusive (and a bit weird to be perfectly honest), but with such great food, that's easily overlooked. This is a must-dine on your next trip to Vegas.  I would recommend going for lunch since it's less $$ too."

The food tasted as ordinary as something I can eat at the Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday's. And I don't know why I even bothered dressing up. Their patrons show up in swimsuits and flip-flops. Gross! I have higher expectations for an establishment that serves $40/plate dishes."

Very fresh, ice cold.   I had the signature sweet BBQ salmon.   Different and delicious.  My husband had the seafood pan roast that was quite good.  But the very best was the Huckleberry cobbler.  Real berries, fabulous crust.   All in all a very good dining experience.  There is ongoing construction that detracted from the ambience, but won't last forever."

I had read the reviews and while my normal go to was chicken, and I don't really do fish, this seemed like a good pic. We started off with appetizers (ceviche and crab claws were good), and a few drinks. The service was good, though we were one of the few tables in at the time. \n\nThe entrees came out and I was pretty impressed by my place. I nice rib eye on a cedar plank, and a side dish of potatoes. However, I was sad to hear most of the rest of the table rave about how spicy and flavorful their dishes were, while mine was pretty \"meh\". Maybe that's what I get for ordering steak at a fish house, but I can't say I would recommend this place to others."
