Prakash was helpful, polite and accommodating. It's Full Halal by the way so Mum can eat anything she wants. The Goat curry, Dhaal, Chili Chicken and everything else on the menu was Delicious! Oh by the way, that Garlic Nun was our fave. So soft and yummy!. Thanks Prakash and all the crew for a job well done. Superb customer service. See you all soon!!"

The vegetable samosas were okay. But all the other food came out cold. The rice also looked like it was reheated."

            "review": "Contrary to these rave reviews, I had quite a different experience here. I'm a huge fan of Indian food, and have had my fair share. I came here with a frequent patron who claimed this place is the best in Vegas, and even she said that the food didn't taste how it normally should. The flavor profiles were all off. \n\nChicken tikka masala- 1 star. The curry didn't taste right. no richness, not much buttery or creamy flavor. \n\nPaneer saag with chicken (spinach dish)- 1star. I wasn't too impressed. Nothing too special about this dish.\n\nAloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower) - 1 star. Cauliflower was overcooked, mushy, and lacked flavor. \n\nGarlic naan- 1 star. The dough was undercooked in certain areas. \n\nSamosas with minced lamb-2 stars. \nI've always gotten potatoes or vegetarian so lamb was a first. Inside was good, but the breading was really strange. It was super doughy and over-fried making the texture almost as crunchy as biting into a rock. Not like I know what that's like...\n\nService- 5 stars. Our glasses were constantly full, they are on top of their game. \n\nThe highlight of my dinner was the green sauce and tamarind sauce they give you at the beginning with some fried stuff. That's about it. I'm a bit afraid to give this place a second shot after my experience as I was really looking forward to it."

I am glad that I did.\nI called ahead and ordered take-out. 30 minutes later when I arrived it was not ready.  It took almost 10 more minutes.  OK.  Now I know, so that is fine.  I ordered the lamb korma and garlic naan.  Woah.  Portions are for sharing.  I saved some for the next day and it was even better.  The large chunks of lamb (which I had to cut in half) were tender and tasty.  The sauce made me realize how much I missed Indian food.  The jasmine rice was perfectly done.  The garlic naan - delicious!  I saw there is a lunch buffet and plenty of seating. Maybe another day I will do the lunch buffet......   thanks to everyone who yelped on this spot.  I found a new Indian take-out spot."

            "review": "I stumbled across this place when we were looking for a new Indian place to try. The place looks a bit sketchy on the outside as the building used to be a Burger King and is in a somewhat run-down plaza. However the food is very yum! The buffet is not the most extensive, but the price is so cheap, especially for Indian food, and the dishes that are available taste pretty good. I am always on the lookout for some good vegetarian Indian dishes, and the 2 times that I have eaten here, there have been always several excellent choices. The palak paneer and the malai kofta were especially good, and their raita and chutneys are excellent accompaniments to the meal. The service is pretty good, too. The manager or owner is pretty friendly and always makes sure to fill up your water glasses. He also drops off a warm basket of fresh naan within minutes of seating you at your table and makes sure to ask if you need more naan. All in all, this is an excellent choice for Indian buffet."

We love Indian buffets, but in the Midwest the quality level can vary quite a bit.  Mount Everest hits it out of the park.  Price was incredibly reasonable (10-15$), they had just about every Indian food I've ever had available, and the taste was sublime.  Mouth-watering delicious.  The staff was polite and friendly too.\n\nThe bus ride was very reasonable.  We bought a Deuce Bus 24 hr pass ($8) which was also good for the city bus, so we were able to hop one from the strip over to there.  Its a pretty quick ride and the neighborhood seemed fine.  I've snagged the Duece pass each time I've been in Vegas and despite being slow at times its one of the best ways to save money when out on the town.\n\nIf you are an Indian Buffet lover, this is my favorite of all the ones I've had, so definitely make the time and give it a stop."

My friend and I went to Mount Everest for dinner on Sunday night after seeing good reviews on Yelp. \n\nThe only downfall of the restaurant is the location. It's in a sketchier place in Las Vegas, but luckily there are large enough windows in the restaurant to keep an eye out on our car. The service was great to start. We ordered a chicken tikka masala and chicken vindaloo, with some naan, and a mango lassi. Every order was authentic, fresh tasting, great portion, and awesome quality. Definitely will come back here and recommend for anyone looking for good Indian food."

I felt dubious at first. What the hell are these copper colored balls floating in a steamy translucent mixture? It looked like something out of Alien. But I was proven wrong. They were sweet, fragrant, and the perfect size. It was like a sponge donut soaked in a sweet sauce. So good! They were the perfect end note after a hearty meal. \n\nThe ambience is cute, too: white linen tables, nice glasses and silverware and a television showing Indian pop culture. Fabulous. Plenty of parking around the restaurant and the service was excellent throughout. I will gladly come here again if a pang for Indian food sparked."

When I arrived a few minutes after my friend, we already had a basket of fresh Naan and waters. The naan was fluffy, tasty, crispy, and just so scrumptious.\n\nThe selection was awesome!! The dishes that stood out for me were the Basmati Rice, Vegetable Korma (vegetables in creamy sauce), Vegetable Samosa (baked pastry with spiced potato mix), and Tandoori Chicken (roasted chicken marinated with spices). My absolute favorite dish had to be the Chicken Makhani (chicken in creamy tomato based gravy); oh my goodness, it was so, so delicious! Amazing flavor and it went well with EVERYTHING. The naan, rice, and even the samosas! I really liked the samosas as well because the pastry was extremely tasty and wonderfully crunchy. The potato mixture inside was also delightful. We also tried the Chicken Curry and Goat Curry, both prepared with the respective meats, tomatoes, and spices. Good, but overshadowed by the amazing Makhani! The Aloo Baingan (eggplant with potatoes) was tasty and prepared very well, but not something I loved. The last item I tried was the Chili Chicken (chicken with garlic, green chili, and onion), but I didn't like it; plus, it was way too spicy for me.\n\nService was really great too! Our waters were refilled quickly and frequently. We also received a Naan refill promptly. I was extremely pleased with the whole experience! This is seriously great food and I can't wait to go back!"

My craving for the Indian buffet had not been satiated by my visit to Mint and so I was determined to have a good experience today. \n\nAfter extensive research on Yelp I decided to try Mt. Everest. A co-worker of mine agreed to join me (ditching his diet) thanks to the fact that Shari S had described the Naans here as being \"billowy.\" We made the long 10 mile trudge to Mt Everest from the office. \n\nThis buffet is seriously amazing. For a little tiny place charging 8.99 per person, it seriously hit every craving and made us happy campers. There is an extensive vegetarian selection in the buffet: soft Basmati rice with peas, Palak Paneer, Punjabi Kadi, Malai Kofta, Dhal, Cauliflower and Potato Stirfry, Sambar, Idly, Samosas, Pakoras and a myriad of chutneys, yogurt, salad and dips. I have only good things to say about every single dish on the buffet. Tasted good and the ingredients were all fresh. Indian buffets frequently omit primo dishes like Paneer (indian cottage cheese cubes), Kofta (indian dumplings in gravy), Samosas and fresh (not frozen) veggies in their food. Mt. Everest did no such thing...they spared no expense and made this buffet experience fantastic. \n\nMy co-worker who eats meat couldn't stop raving about the creamy Chicken Makhani, Lamb Curry and the Samosas (he went pretty crazy with all the chutneys). \n\nAnd yes, the garlic naans that came with the buffet (we asked for garlic) were billowy. And extremely tasty. \n\nMy only gripe with Mt. Everest is the dessert selection. They had sweet rice...which really is a cop-out dessert. But I settled for their fresh fruit selection (oranges and watermelon). I would give these guys a 4.5 stars (taking off a half star for the dessert) but since I can't on Yelp, they get a four. Next time, if they serve Gulab Jamun I will be more than happy to up it to a no-questions asked 5 star review.\n\nIt's truly heartwarming to see an Indian buffet keep it's quality consistent even after being open a while. Mt. Everest really did warm my heart and brought back some of my lost hope in the Indian buffet genre in Las Vegas. \n\nThanks to all the Yelpers that did a wonderful job describing this place. You guys were spot on!"

From the reviews I read I noticed that many customers suggest increasing the heat that comes with many of the entr\u00e9es. I was afraid so I picked mild. I had tried the chicken vindaloo and I'm so glad I did. The spices were very well represented in this dish. It wasn't over whelming on your palate. And this dish comes with potatoes and a assortment of flavors. The sauce was tomato based and creamy. It came with rice, and if I could, I would eat it all day. There was no worrying about heartburn or indigestion having it mild. The waiter, the busboy and the manager are very professional. The manager, Prakash whom I shook hands with has such a kind heart and I look forward to coming back again. Before I forget, try the kilfi which is  ice cream with saffron and pistachia flavors that is very well represented. This is a must go to restaurant if you're in Vegas for a visit."

We ordered a bottle of wine and a few various dinners and naan, which we did wait a little while to actually receive, but it was so worth the wait. Everything was amazing! I had the Chicken Tikka Masala, which I would surely order again.

Now, probably three years later and 20 lbs heavier, the owner won't let me forget it Haha. To b honest it's kind of funny seeing as I'm also 7 months pregnant. But every time I go in he's gotta say something about my weight. I don't think he knows I'm pregnant because I'm just so shocked he'd treat anyone like that, much less a customer. But then again... Weird creepy foreigner vibe... Am I right ladies ? \nSo I just stopped spending my money here all together. due to the fact hed treat me the way he has it makes me wonder how he actually handles what's going behind the kitchen.\n\nBtw the buffet is crap."

Perhaps this was just an \"off\" day for their lunch buffet.\n\nLet me explain that we were not treated badly, we were just ignored for the most part.  I tried almost everything on the buffet and I enjoy eating Indian food and was looking forward to lunch here since the day before since I had never been.\n\nThat said... \n\nI have been to several different Indian places here in town and after reading other reviews I didn't know exactly what to expect.\n\nThe service was barely there and the lunch buffet (about an hour and a half into service) was messy.  The steam table was occasionally being \"refilled\" instead of changed out.  At least, theoretically, the food that was there at the beginning would only last till the end of the lunch hours. There were a few other cleanliness issues but I'll leave it at that.  \n\nThe tap water served in the cloudy glass could not be overlooked. \n\nThe items on the lunch buffet itself, some overcooked, were just okay at best.  Other items bear only slight resemblance to the preparations I've had at other Indian places.  I really do enjoy Indian food and I really went into this WANTING to like this place.   \n\nThere are a lot of Indian lunch buffets in Las Vegas and if you have the means to go to a different one... *sigh* ...go."

At first we found it interesting how the restaurant seemed like a renovated Burger King but that didn't matter as at least the building was being re-used instead of sitting empty or knocked down.\n\nWe were taken aback by how wonderful the food was. The Lamb Saag, Chicken Vindaloo & a vegetable dish is always our main staple. Every time we go in the owner (I think it's the owner) Prakash greats us and recognizes us. It's very nice to know he cares about his guests and treats them with respect and makes us feel special.\n\nWe've tried several other Indian establishments, and although they are good and offer a nice experience we always seem to compare them to Mt.

Overall, the food was poor from the very dry Samosas to the Chicken Tikka which had an embarrassingly small amount of chicken. Also, a carafe of water on the table would be a great idea considering the dryness of the food.  I  went in with an open mind, but quickly realized this was just not a good restaurant."

The menu will only frustrate, as everything looks great. I went with the vindaloo (lamb), an order of naan, and $5 glass of merlot. The merlot was about what you can expect for $5. The naan was a scoach undercooked and bland. The vindaloo was damn-near perfect. The waiter simply asked if I like spicy (no number game), and the dish was the just the right amount to get your tongue tingling, but not overwhelming. Sure the decor maybe flavorless and the staff unprofessional (a busser/assistant in a stocking hat?), but the spices are dead on. I plan many 'o follow-up at the summit of Everest."

While we can't comment on the buffet, we can say that dinner there was superb.  We started with the complementary papadum.  The mint sauce it came with was thick and spicier than we're used to, which we preferred, and the tamarind was just right.  For an appetizer, we ordered the keema samosas, which are filled with ground lamb, peas and spices.  They were so flavorful.  The shell was crispy, and wasn't covered in salt like we've had at other places, and they were as filled as they could have been.  We ordered 3 plates, which was enough for the two of us to take half home for the next day.  The sauce on the chicken tikka was better than we had in restaurants in London's Brick Lane.  We ordered it at spiciness level 6, and were pleased that it wasn't as diluted with cream as we've had elsewhere.  The lamb vindaloo (level 7) was great.  The lamb was lean, and there was plenty of it.  Nice to find lamb with potatoes, instead of potatoes with lamb.  Sometimes, all we taste is the heat and salt, but this vindaloo was layered with flavors.  Our third plate was baingan bharta.  It was delicious, with complex subtle flavors.  We enjoyed mango lassi with our meal (and took home 2 to have the next day with our left-overs).  They were so thick that our glasses were filled to the brim and the waiter didn't spill a drop.  The service was very attentive, friendly, and professional, without being overwhelming.  We loved that they were playing Indian music - it made a pleasing background, and didn't drown out our conversation.  Even though it's not in the best of neighborhoods, we felt safe.  Our only negative comment is that they use Styrofoam take-out containers, which aren't eco-friendly.  We will definitely be returning soon."

This restaurant is about 2 miles west of the strip near Palace Station Casino (The Casino where OJ finally got arrested).

The naan bread was soft and just amazing. Except the palak paneer ( spinach and Indian cheese) I think everything was made to perfection. The carrot halwa ( carrot pudding) was good too. The yellow daal tasted homemade, just how my mom would make. The butter chicken and goat curry were good too. \nI always get excited when I see momos ( Nepalese Indian dumplings) on any menu.

We passed by Chinatown because she could not eat anything in that vicinity. \n\nRunning short on time we were not able to get to our original destination. While on Sahara we passed by this place and good thing because my heart was set on Indian. Seeing that most of my friends has written so highly of this place, it was worth giving a try. For $10.99, the lunch buffet is one amazing deal. \n\nI wasted no time, got a plate and created a mountain that would give Everest a run for its money. Saag Paneer will always be my favorite. I spooned some onto my plate and was elated with the large cubes of cheese swimming in my spinach. The sweet rice can be eaten on its own as a dessert like the similarly florescent orange rice found in Vietnamese eateries or used to balance out the spice in your favorite curry. I ate it with my meal and it contributed a nice contrast to everything else on my plate. The Aloo Gobi was seasoned well, but did not have much cauliflower. The Goat Curry was tender and did not possess the gaminess that people normally complain about. The stew did contain many small bone. I spent some time picking through to be safe. The tandoori was dry on the outside and moist on the inside. I have never seen that before, so it was not a total bust. If there was an aspect to complain about, it was that I was not at the table to order garlic naan. Plain naan just doesn't do anything for me anymore. The Gulab Juman are delicious, but more than two of these fried milk balls and I am sure to become diabetic."

I usually like to order off the menu at places like this but for some reason it seems like Indian places in Vegas prefer to do buffet only for lunch. After seeing a bunch of positive friends' reviews of this place we figured it was a fairly safe and solid choice\n\nGiven the time we arrived, I'd say the buffet was still fairly full since the lunch buffet ends at 3 pm, however, we never saw it refilled while we were there. On my first plate I tried a little bit of everything which meant I had a pretty full plate to work through. The stand outs were the curry chicken, tandoori chicken, and chili chicken, which had a little kick to it. The veggie samosa and sweet basmati rice were ok...and are probably an acquired taste. Fresh naan was brought to our table and it was warm and delicious! Not burnt, old, or cold like some other places. After the first plate I was already pretty full and just got seconds of the chicken dishes I liked.\n\nWe wanted to try their milky balls =P for dessert but they were all gone by the time we were done eating so we had to settle for the sweet rice pudding instead, which I believe is called kheer? For $10.99 for an AYCE buffet the food was decent and I would come back the next time I have a craving for Indian food."

My go-to is the Saag, but I usually eat off of my friends' plates as well and it's all been delicious. The customer service here is unparalleled, and I always feel like my business is appreciated. Often it is the owner serving us. The only downside I'd have to say is that the food is so yummy I usually accidentally over-eat to an uncomfortable level... But I guess that's my own fault!"

The tikka was ok, big chunks of tender chicken, but the sauce was too sweet. The palak paneer was very good, although I like it a little spicier. The lamb vindaloo was excellent. Big, juicy chunks of lamb perfectly spiced. I'm usually not a big fan of lamb, but i really liked it. The chicken korma was excellent as well. Again, big chunks, perfectly spiced, delicious. Garlic nann was perfect. Two pieces were plenty for the four of us (with all the rest we ordered.) \n\nThe service was exceptional. Very prompt, polite, and helpful. No one at our table had ever tried goat, and my brother-in-law was asking our server about it. The server was a very nice young man and tried to describe the flavor, texture, etc. Anyway, we ended up with the lamb vindaloo instead. Later, the server came by with a sample of the goat curry. He didn't have to do that, it was very nice. And, I found out I love goat! Absolutely delicious. He also brought fresh rice to take home with our leftovers. I felt he went above and beyond. We'll eat here again next time we're in Vegas!"

We reach there and as we try to push the door open, the door pushes back !! After a couple of minutes of intense trying and my worst Hulk imitation the door yields and we see a huge crowd in front of us. Just like back in India:( \n\nWe wait for a few min to see if there is a chance to give our name to someone and then decide to order takeout. We suspected that the take out would be sooner than waiting to be seated. It's a small place not equipped to handle the crowd. People ended up waiting next to others table mentally wishing them to Finish soon so we can grab their seat!\n\nWe placed our order and got it about 90 min later. The chili chicken was average. The samosa had the distinct flavor of being refried. The oil from the veg noodles dripped out in the plastic and the chicken biryani was palatable.. Barely. For good measure they threw in some cut onions and lemon just before we left that was previously refused by a customer!\n\nNow I understand why they call it Mount Everest. The effort needed to get in and eat the food with the ambiance provided makes the name quite apt. Wish Yelp had a no star option :/"

When we got there around 830, the place was ratehr quiet. Its a spacious restaurant but when its not packed (on a Saturday night), you start to wonder. It took a few moments before they got our table ready and a little coaxing for them to come an take our order. Although we were in no particular hurry, they did not seem to be anxious to serve us. I must confess the staff were in uniform and when they finally got to us, they were very pleasant.\nThe best part was the food. We ordered Shahi Paneer and Bhindi Masla. (we were vegetarians). The food was delivered by someone who seemed like an important person (could have been one of the owners - he was not wearing a uniform) and in an almost ceremonious manner !! The flavoring was very balanced (we asked for medium), tasteful, well presented, hot and in adequate quantity for two. The Naans were fluffy and fresh. My acid test for North Indian restaurants is the paneer tikka masala but the shahi panner gave me enough evidence that the chef knew what he was doing. We finsihed our meal leisurely and just as we  were finsihing up, we noticed the other tables were filling up. After it was Las Vegas and perhaps we were there a little early.\nEnjoy this nondescript, off the strip authentic Indian cuisine. You should not be disappointed."

Then bring them down to Mount Everest!\n\nI don't know why, but my husband and I always order our \"staples\" when we go to an Indian restaurant and we can be pretty particular about them.  Things were no different here.  Our staples are: Saag Paneer (called Palak Paneer here), Vegetable Korma, Mango Lassi, and Garlic Naan.  Because we had a restaurant.com coupon, we were also able to order Paneer Tiki Masala and Vegetable Samosas.\n\nNormally at other Indian restaurants this would be a ton of food for us which (sadly) we can finish if we are hungry enough (but we are giant pigs).  Mount Everest takes the cake for largest serving sizes in the valley.  We had two boxes of leftovers!  You are definitely getting your money's worth here.\n\nNot only are the portions huge, but this is some of the best Indian food I've had.  They have given my beloved Mint a run for their money.  The Paneer Tiki Masala had great flavor and lots of paneer.  Plus the paneer was fantastic- it was denser than most paneer and had a very mild flavor.  I could be wrong, but it seemed like it was made fresh.  The Vegetable Korma was mildly spiced (in a good way) and was loaded with a large variety of fresh vegetables.  The Saag Paneer was a little different than what I'm used to, but I still enjoyed it.  It was a little milder, had a lot of cream, and the spinach was well-blended.  All these dishes we ordered medium, but they were pretty mild on the spice.  I think we could have could have ordered spicier and been ok.\n\nThe free Papadums were good and I enjoyed the mint and tamarind sauces.  The mango lassi, while having a very interesting intense orange color I'm not used to, was very good as well.  The vegetable samosas were gigantic but a little bit on the greasy side.  The garlic naan had every inch covered in garlic (hooray!) but seemed a little uncooked in the middle.  \n\nThe service was very friendly but a little slow at times, especially when the place began to fill up.  The building may be a little iffy on the outside (what is that, an old Pizza Hut?) it was very nice on the inside and very clean.  Plus they play Bollywood movies!\n\nOh, and did I mention that they gave us an extra giant order of rice for all our leftovers?  For free?\n\nOverall, this is a great place to enjoy some delicious Indian food.  Just be prepared to take some home!"

As usual I was skeptical of any Indian place with good reviews but decided to give it a try hoping to be proved wrong. Mount Everest is located on Sahara Avenue not too far from the strip and has sufficient parking so location and accessibility is fine.\n\nWhen we entered at peak lunch hour on Sunday the place was packed which I took as a good sign. As the restaurant is small and tables are cramped close to each other so seating is very uncomfortable and navigating to and from the buffet is painful as you void bumping into other diners.\n\nThe dishes were standard fare that you will find in any Indian buffet. The appetizers included tandoori chicken, samosa and some fried potato dish. Butter chicken, saag, chili chicken and mutton curry were entrees. Then there was steamed rice and dal and lastly gulab jamun and sweet rice for desert.\n\nTaste wise what stood out to me was that every dish was bad. Not just one or two items but everything that I ate was the text book definition of bad Indian food. Tandoori chicken seemed to be boiled and then doused with a lot of color as it lacked any flavor at all and was stone cold. The samosa seemed to be undercooked. The pan fried potato were limp and seemed to be days old. The butter chicken was barely edible. Chili chicken tasted gross and the goat in the mutton curry was undercooked so was chewy (not one person in our entire group could eat the goat). The naan provided at the table was thin and overcooked so it felt like a crispy flatbread. We asked for garlic naan which was better but it came at the fag end of the meal so it was almost useless. The gulab jamun was one of the worst that I'd ever had and the sweet rice was forgettable. I also noticed that there was no biryani in this buffet.\n\nService was also slow. As mentioned garlic naan was provided at the end of the meal. Plates were not cleared quickly so we ended up stacking them in one corner which made the small table feel even more cramped. Even stacked plates did not prompt quick service and at one time we were scared that the plates would topple over and cause a mess but that did not deter our servers from ignoring them.\n\nAt the end of the meal I was happy to be out of this small, cramped, claustrophobic place with terrible food. A sentiment echoed by each and every member of our group that ate here.\n\nPrice wise it was $10.99 which is typical for Indian buffet's but what I can't get is the high ratings for this place. unfortunately another Indian restaurant that did not live up to its sky high ratings. Obviously won't make the mistake of returning again."

He suggest foods we weren't going to originally  order and customized  foods based off what we told him we liked. He demanded we try and dessert which was beyond amazing. Great family restaurant with 5* food. Next time we are in Vegas, we will definitely be back."

The naan was amazing and there was an orange colored rice that was to die for.\nI was not in love with any of the food but I am a very picky eater.  My 4 stars was because the people I went with enjoyed all of the food very much and all have had Indian food prior to visiting Mount Everest.  They said it was one of the best Indian restaurants in Las Vegas!"

I've only had Mount Everest's buffet, and I was really impressed by it. When my sister was in town we decided to check this place out. We came for dinner around 7:30PM. \n\nThe restaurant wasn't that busy at that time. We were seated immediately. We ordered Samosa Chat for appetizer. The chat was ok, it was covered into much yogurt and there was no tamarind sauce on it. The dinner order was Vegetable Navarattan Korma, Daal Makhani, and Chicken Tikka Masala with Garlic Naan. The curries come with rice, which is a plus.  The curries were delicious and there was plenty leftover food for next day. The naan was fresh and tender. I really like this restaurant for their food, with the exception of appetizer this location is almost as good as Mint."

The reason this is not a solid 5 stars is one thing - ambiance. To give a 5 stars I'd like a better ambiance. Don't get me wrong, the place is clean, smells amazing, and plays lively music...it just needs maybe a little something extra for the solid 5th star. We make the drive from Henderson without hesitation to stuff ourselves with the tastiest Indian dishes around. If you are not a local, do not let the neighborhood deter you from going in. Go in! You will not regret it.\n\nThe Chicken Tiki Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Palak Paneer, the Chili Chicken, the Vegetable Pakora, and the fresh naan are all amazing every time we go. The people are super polite. The place is clean. Great job Mount Everest!"

Everest. At $10.99 for a lunch buffet of a pretty good spread that would please just about any palate:\n\nBasmati and Sweet Rice, Jhukuni Aloo, Vegetable Samosas, Punjabi Kadi, Palak Paneer, Mattar Paneer, Gajar Halwa, Chicken Curry, Goat Curry, Chili Chicken, Chicken Makhani, Tandoori Chicken, Salad Bar, Assorted Chutneys, Naan, and Rice Pudding. I tried every offering once, then went back for seconds and thirds of my favorites, the sweet rice, goat curry, punjabi kadi, and both paneer dishes. Honestly one of the best lunch deals in town.\n\nService was great, water glasses and our naan basket was replenished quickly, and you can watch and listen to some Bollywood action while enjoying your meal. Looking forward to returning, and this time, no need to wait for that blue moon!.....ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uu  4.5\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(38/365) \"Bomb Bites And Bollywood Beats\""

The quality of the food is comparable to Gaylord's but you get more food and pay a lot less.  The people that work here are very nice and friendly.  They have Bollywood videos on at all times.\n\nThey give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces.  We started of with samosa (they're like potato-filled empanadas with ginger and spices) and aloo tikki (fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick pea batter).\n\nMango Lasi:\nCreamy mango shake. 5/5\n\nVeggie Samosa:\nYou get two pieces for $4.  The crust was the right thickness and wasn't too doughy.  You can definitely taste the spices.  I had to use the tamarind sauce to tone down the heat a bit. Very filling. 4/5\n\nAloo Tikki:\nYou get 2 patties for $4. Crispy deep-fried mashed potatoes.  Very filling as well.  Great flavor. 5/5\n\nPalak Paneer:\nI was looking for the cheese on top since that's what I'm used to.  4/5\n\nGarlic Naan:\nI love this stuff.  We had 2 orders. Hot, garlicky and buttery bread to scoop/dip saucy dishes with. 5/5\n\nChicken Tikka Masala:\nMy favorite Indian dish.  We ordered mild but it was still quite spicy...but it burned so good. 5/5\n\nKulfi:\nA mild cheesy ice cream and you can see pistachio bits. 4/5\n\nGulab Jamun:\nMy favorite Indian dessert. They're like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup. 5/5\n\nI honestly wasn't expecting the food to be that good.  This is my new favorite in Vegas!  They also have a lunch buffet from 11am-3pm for $10-11.  I'd come back here for that!"

I will give it another shot if I am in the area, but I don't see myself driving out of the way to eat here. Their buffet is fairly limited and most of the food lacked ANY spice factor. It was almost bland and some of it was overcooked. My favorite part was the rice and the naan. I did finish my small plate and had no desire for seconds. The meats were fatty and low quality and the buffet was not exactly cheap at $10.99 + tip. The owner seems like a nice gentleman and recognized my friend who worships this place. The service however was close to non existent and toward the end we felt rushed. I am a fan of Indian food and have sampled several places around town, and this would probably stack somewhere in the middle. I would be interested in trying their dinner items to see how they stack up in that category. Overall, just an okay Indian buffet with not much separating it from the rest of the pack other than the owner who seems to care about his return patrons."

Upon walking into the restaurant, I noticed the buffet in the back corner looking sad and unsanitary. I sat down and shortly after we were brought out the papadum and were asked what we wanted to order. The papadum and sauces just weren't good and to top things off the basket it was in was not cleaned. I shouldn't have overlooked this but I did because I was craving Indian food. I ordered two mango lassi's, garlic naan, malai kofta, chicken makhani their speciality, and basmati rice. The mango lassi's were brought out instantly. This one was not made well, was overly sweet, tasted artificial, and was not thick enough. I was able to stomach mine but my dining partner wanted to send hers back. I asked the Asian man if we could send it back and he giggled and said no. Then our Indian waiter comes over laughs and says Mango Lassi's our supposed to be sweet and I said I know I have had my a Mango Lassi before but but this overly sweet, he begrudgingly took it back. \n\nOur entrees come and the portions are huge. Both of the curries had that artificial taste and reminded me of curry at a food court. The chicken in the chicken makhani was dry and the fat was not trimmed off properly. The veggie balls in the malai kofta were extremely hard on the outside and not very moist on the inside. The garlic naan was tasty but once again it was brought out in a basket that was not clean. \n\nThe Indian food here is mediocre and I question how well things are cleaned."

Everest is quite a distance from where we live, we hadn't been back in over a year.  But I missed the place, and felt bad that the owner had always been so nice and accommodating to us, and didn't think we were being upstanding citizens by not rewarding his hospitality.\n\nNot only did he remember us, he even remembered the fact that I hate overly salty food!!\n\nI ordered a glass of the house Woodbridge Riesling, and for $5 got something rare: a FULL glass.  We thought we'd order a mulligatawny soup to share, in addition to the Mt. Everest thali that we were also going to share, but the owner talked us out of it, saying I'd find it too salty.  Now that's service!  He suggested the Chau Chau soup instead, which has noodles, onion, cilantro, and tomato.  It had just the right amount of kick and was very tasty.  And not salty.  \n\nHaving the thali was definitely like coming home again.  A large appetizer platter of  goodies, including a delicious samosa, tandoori chicken, beef kebab, and lots of pakora filled me up before the piece de resistance, the large silver tray with my favorite - palak paneer - which had a goodly amount of the paneer, lentils, chicken tikka, lamb curry, raita, and the dessert, kheer.  We had asked for kulfi instead of the kheer, and for it to be served at the end of the meal, since it's frozen.  No problem - we got the kulfi, and were told to keep the kheer anyway.  Everything was excellent, except for the lamb, which was tough.  I could have said something, but who needed more food?  We took some leftovers home anyway.\n\nWe're not going wait another year before going back to Mt. Everest.  It's that good!"

So after a couple months of persuading, my two friends who aren't so adventurous in cuisines as much as I am, finally decided to accompany me to Mt. Everest. I'd admit the venue is a bit sketchy but I just kept pulling the two inside. I already know my favorite Indian dishes, so I ordered for my friends since they don't know what dishes are what. We went for Chicken Tikka Masala, Korma, and tandoori. I thought those dishes were the most \"friendly\" to those who've never had Indian food before, so yeah. We also got garlic and regular naan combination, and mango lassi (my favorite!). I liked every dish we ordered, especially the Korma. I can't stop dipping my garlic naan into it. And the lassi was just perfect. I wanted to drink a whole pitcher if I could. The service was very friendly and he didn't hesitate to help us with any questions regarding the dishes. In past experiences with Indian restaurants, I felt like the service have been quite rushed and somewhat rude, but Mt. Everest's server was quite congenial.

It's soft and thick, rather than the tortilla-bread-like naan you find at some places.\n\nThey also have basic potato samosas and vegetable pakora. \n\nSadly, I don't get to come as often, because I don't work nearby anymore. :("

He gave wonderful beer and food recommendations, checked on us numerous times, and brought us a small bite of dessert on the house before calling us a cab back to the strip.  What a wonderful evening!  A must-dine restaurant for anyone adventurous enough to get away from all the typical tourist traps.

Based on Yelp, we decided to check out Mt Everest India's Cuisine for a lunch brunch buffet on a Thursday afternoon.  I believe it was only $9.99 per person (clearly I did not pay) and it was delicious!!!  The food was absolutely fantastic.  The lamb did not have that gamey lamb taste and several of us who do not normally eat lamb went back for seconds (and thirds??).  The samosas were the best I have ever tasted (my husband is Indian) because they were not overwhelmed by potatoes.  You could actually eat one and still have room for the rest of your meal.  The service was excellent and based on the variety of different customers we saw enjoying their lunch Mt Everest India's Cuisine is clearly a favorite and worth the short cab trip from any Vegas hotel.  (They even called us a cab with a wonderful driver who had us laughing all the way back to our hotel!)"

            "review": "I never thought anyone could take the title away from Tamba on the Strip, but this is my favourite Indian restaurant, be it buffet or dinner, in Las Vegas.\n\nI'm a vegetarian, so I can only comment on the meat-free dishes, although my husband the carnivore seems to end up using all of the same adjectives I do: subtle, complex, smooth, consistent, rich, plentiful, varied, fresh...\n\nWe've been visiting Mt. Everest since it opened over a year ago, but it was only last weekend that I got to try their Navratan Korma. A-ma-zing. Buttery, spicy, and not stingy at all with the paneer.\n\nOne thing I should confess is that I do love paneer dishes, save for that one most people love (sag paneer), so when I encounter an Indian buffet with only vegetable dishes, those vegetables better be pretty special to win me over. Mt. Everest is one of the few buffets where the vegetables are so tasty that I don't need a paneer offering to feel satisfied. (That said, Mt. Everest always has some sort of paneer dish, and when it's my nemesis sag paneer, they usually also have a kofta (dumpling) dish. Also, they always serve pakora, so I never lack for a \"hearty\" item on the plate.) I especially recommend their bombay aloo and any dal dish. One vegetable I've never seen at Mt. Everest is mushrooms, but otherwise the veg section is often a surprise.\n\nAnother point in Mt. Everest's favour, per my own tastes, is that they always offer samosas (small, light, pleasant) and vegetable pakora. Again, I like an Indian buffet that doesn't leave the more substantial offerings to the meat eaters. I also appreciate that the pakora is of the \"funny shapes\" variety, which I prefer to the greasier \"pressed patties\" you sometimes find elsewhere. (I'm looking at you, Bollywood and Samosa Factory.) The pakora tend to be small enough to not get overly dense, but - unlike my former fave Tamba - Mt. Everest never leaves you with tiny pakora \"droppings.\"\n\nThe dessert selection is certainly smaller than on some other buffets - almost always a sweet rice and a type of rice pudding (the names escape me). They're both solid fare, but I seldom seem to save room, so it's a bit of a non-issue for me. (It's saying a lot when I can love a buffet that doesn't offer pappadums or gulab jamun.)\n\nThe naan is billowy and brought hot to the table. When we finish, we are always offered more. (Sometimes we are also often offered garlic naan, although after reading others' reviews that may just be a perk for the regulars. No worries - if you come here once, you too will be a regular soon enough.)\n\nMost of my comments above pertain to the buffet. If you like the buffet, dinner at Mt. Everest will not only impress you, it may spoil you for all other Indian places in town. How can something so delicious for lunch be even better at dinner? Perhaps it's being able to get exactly the dish you want spiced just how you like, but somehow they exceed expectations with care that goes into individual dishes. I particularly recommend the shahi paneer. It is now the gold standard by which I measure all \"creamy + nutty\" sauces.\n\nI realize this review is very gushy, so I'm racking my brain for some sort of flaw lest someone think I'm on the payroll. I could pick on the location - a former Burger King in the Mariana's supermarket parking lot - but you know what? It's so nice inside that you'll never notice. The decor is simple but comfortable and fastidiously clean. It's not an ultralounge. It's not a reimagining. It's just a restaurant with terrific food and the occasional Bollywood video playing on the corner television.\n\nService is always very friendly. You will never want for ice water, and the staff takes a genuine interest in how you are enjoying your meal. The only way they could make me happier is to offer cooking classes. (Please? Please?!) \n\n\nOh, wait, I do have a criticism! Sometimes, I think the mattar paneer is just a teensy bit too full of peas... yeah, that's the best I can do. Sorry. Mt. Everest is simply rather wonderful In fact, it is the sort of restaurant for which Yelp should offer a sixth star. Mmmm..."

I was glad that the outward appearance of the restaurant had been mentioned, as it may have kept me from going in if I had just been driving by. Once you enter though, it's a great environment with the white tablecloths and napkins. As someone dining alone, I particularly enjoyed the Bollywood playing in the corner. It kept me entertained while I was waiting for my food, which was an excellent break from the standard of playing with my phone. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is my basis for judging a restaurant (much like Pad Thai at a Thai restaurant). The sauce was amazingly creamy, and had a slow burn to it, which I find the hallmark of a good sauce. I want the spice, but not at the expense of the flavor. The naan was perfect with a crispy edge and soft center. Ideal for sopping up the sauce. \n\nBut even more than the food, the service was phenomenal. Everyone is very friendly, but give you your space. My water never got below half-way full, and I can put away water like a camel, so that's impressive. And when I had a problem, they were endlessly gracious and worked with me while I figured it out. Few restaurants would take the time or effort to come up with a mutually satisfying solution the way that they did.\n\nEnd result: If I lived here, I'd weigh a million pounds because I would eat here all the time. As it is, I'll have to settle for stopping in every time I'm in town."

The best dish, however is a toss up between their chili chicken and rice pudding dessert. For very different reasons each dish is Tasty. The chili chicken has heat and a delectable blend of spices. The rice pudding is just sweet enough and a refreshing end to a meal filled with spicy goodness. If you're a fan of Indian cuisine or first timer, I'd suggest you try this place. There is something for everyone. And if it counts for anything, my Indian coworker says Mt Everest is better than mint and India Marsala."

I took my girlfriend there a few months ago for her birthday as she's never had Indian food before but always wanted to try it. The restaurant is in what looks to be a former Pizza Hut or maybe a KFC and they set up the buffet trays where the cash registers used to be. Despite the former use of the space, they managed to create a very nice ambiance inside, dark and with banging Bollywood songs on the TV. Those were some great music videos and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the actors/signers and movies being shown and was happy to share. \n\nAs for the food, as I already said it is some of if not the best Indian food I've ever had, and I'm no novice. I found that if there's  something not  on the menu that you'd like, ask and they'll make it. I'm partial to goat vindaloo which they didn't have on the menu but were more than happy to make. My girlfriend got chicken tikka masala. Both our curries were a 10 (which was a tad  ambitious for her) and the spice was very good. The vindaloo was done perfectly as was the chicken. I've found a lot of places when you order a 10, they just dump a bunch  of cayenne to heat it up, but it was clear it was an across the board spice increase  and you could taste the difference. My girlfriend also had  a mango lassi  and while I'm not as familiar with them as I  am curry, it seemed really really good. \n\nAs I mentioned, my girlfriend was  a bit overzealous in ordering a ten and while she managed to eat it, it was still a bit too spicy. The manager  must have noticed she was having issues because he offered  us a free serving of gulab jamun for her troubles. They definitely earn top marks for service as well as food."

The chicken korma was all sauce, no chicken to be seen and of the rest of the dishes, some were sparse, some were old looking with sauces separated and the Tandoori chicken was only dark meat and not nearly crispy enough on the outside nor cooked well enough for me inside.

The chili chicken was tasty but also very greasy and the vegetable korma was good and I enjoyed the spiciness of the food, it packed a heat punch. Naan was just okay, I would have ordered garlic naan if given a choice but service was sluggish and we were fairly ignored. My daughter needed water since all of us had empty water glasses and no one refilling so I got up and poured all of us a glass of water from pitchers they had sitting nearby.

Their plain naan is warm a perfect pairing with their many curries.  \n\nI have never had a problem with finding a table, even at peak hours.  Also their service is also super attentive and friendly.  I don't think my cup of water ever went empty.  It is easy to say that will continue come back here to satisfy future Indian food cravings."

Their prices seem to be slightly lower than India Palace and their portions were definitely much larger.\n\nWe had the vegetable samosa to start- it was a tad salty but with the two chutneys, they really balanced out.\n\nWe also had:\nChili Naan- was good, not spicy at all\n\nChicken Tikka- same as tandoori chicken but boneless. It was good, some pieces were a little dry but overall pretty good.  I don't understand the french fries on top though...that kinda threw me off..hmmm.\n\nLamb Vindaloo- delish.  Lamb were actual pieces of lamb, not the ground lamb like some places use.  Very flavorful, not too gamey.\n\nAloo matter- potatoes and peas in a sauce, again, large portion and large chunks of potatoes\n\nOverall- everything was excellent, medium spice still gave all the entrees a little kick.  I just asked for hot sauce on the side to add to my food since I really like it spicy.\n\nWill definitely be back, next time with my daughter as I know she will really enjoy it!  No butter chicken on the menu but think I'll try the chicken korma next!"

When we pulled up, it looked a little shady.  But some of the best places are holes in the wall, though, right?\n\nWhen we went inside, it was nice and clean.  White table clothes on the tables and we were seated immediately by a nice man who turned out to be the owner.  The menu has plenty of selection and it was hard just settling on one thing for myself.  I had two other people with me and we ordered the garlic naan, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, and lamb curry.  I also wanted shrimp curry, but I thought it best to not let my eyes exceed my stomach.  Our food arrived quick enough and the portions were huge.  We all shared what everyone ordered, as that is how it arrives...typical of Indian cuisine establishments that I've been to.\n\nThe garlic naan was excellent and so was everything else.  We ordered the mild spice level on everything, mostly because of my wife.  I could have handled it a bit hotter, but I'm okay with mild.  Everything was excellent.  The chicken tikka masala was the biggest winner of the night and the best I've had anywhere.  It was seasoned perfectly.  The biryani was amazing, too, and I've only had better in one other place (Amber India in San Francisco).\n\nWhen we were all stuffed, we still had leftovers.  Our drinks were always kept full and the staff and owner were very nice.  The owner offered us dessert but we were simply too full to eat any more.  He insisted and gave us some besan ladoo (I think that's what it's called) on the house!  They were very good.  We were impressed and appreciated the gratitude he showed us.\n\nI'm in Vegas about twice a year or so and this will DEFINITELY be a place I come back to every time I'm in town."

When you enter this restaurant it's clear that it is Nepali with the Buddhist prayer flags, photos of Nepal, and the drape of Swayambunath temple image of Buddha's eyes hung up on one of the walls. Although, many of the dishes are Indian and the lunch buffet has many Indian dishes, a significant portion of the restaurant's menu is pure Nepali food. Being a Nepali, it's disappointing that the restaurant needs to be advertised at 100% Indian to retain and bring business. I just wish customers would recognize that it's both Nepali and Indian. They are two different countries with similar cuisines. \n\nAnyway, hope some readers found that educational! \n\nNow for the FOOD! As a lover of Nepali and Indian food, this restaurant is top notch. Definitely one of the best I've been to the in the United States. It rivals restaurants in Queens, New York which probably has the highest density of Nepali restaurants anywhere in the states. My partner actually thinks its even better than our favorite place out there. \n\nWe came here twice in two weeks when we were in Vegas for rest stops during our epic road trip. We both focused on entirely on the Nepali food side which is on the left. Their chicken chilly is AMAZING - so on point with the flavor. Perfect amount of onions, bell peppers, and loaded with tender and fresh chicken. \n\nTheir goat meat is as good as my mama makes it,  especially the gravy. A lot of Nepali restaurants tend to under cook or have really tough pieces of goat meat, but everything is so tender here, it's incredible! Chicken curry also absolutely delicious. The second time we were there, they had toor daal, so I had a traditional plate of dal, rice, meats, and vegetables and even ate with my right hand. The very traditional way of enjoying Nepali cuisine to the max! \n\nAlso, my partner and I bought a bunch of orders of Nepali momos to go, which they have on their menu outside of the lunch buffet. Simply delicious. So authentic. Loaded with tasty meat filling! Loved having it later at our leisure. \n\nI also tried all their Indian dishes and they're just as amazing. I especially like the vegetarian kofta. Each dish is perfect. I typically find that restaurant's that have both selections master one or the other. Mt Everest is a slam dunk at South Asian cuisine. \n\nWhether you live in Vegas or are stopping through as a tourist, get your behind off the strip and come here for amazing Nepali and Indian food."

I came here based on Yelp reviews and left highly disappointed, not because it was bad (it wasn't, it was just pretty good) but because of the notion that this is as good as it is supposed to get in Vegas.  Granted it was only for the lunch buffet, but I guess I don't know if it will get any more than marginally better for made-to-order entrees.\n\nNow, the food in itself is pretty good - decent flavors, ample choices for buffet.  But it's not very spicy.  At all.  That's actually a big deal because I think part of what makes curry & masala what they are is the distinct kick they produce.  \n\nService is spartan due to the buffet nature, but is pleasant when provided.  Place wreaks of herbs, so I'm thinking maybe they need a bit more ventilation.  Area is a bit fishy, but out in the open so not too worried about safety.\n\nIn all, it's a fine place for Indian food but you'll leave wanting to see if there is something better.  \n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  Not sure for dinner, but I felt it would be just fine sitting alone for a bite."

I don't normally like goat but they cooked it here to taste like beef which was very nice. The naan was the BEST naan I ever had!!!!!! It was just plain naan and I wasn't expecting much but man I was wrong. It was the perfect piece; slightly sweet, chewy, salty, and so perfect. I would order fifty of these when I come back. It is a hole in the wall place that isn't well lit and it's also in a sketchy part of town, but other than that lunch buffet is a must try. And eat the naan."

This place really reminded me of home cooked food. The owner and the servers were really attentive and made sure we always had naan and water on our table. They cleared out plates as soon as we were done. Because it was new years, the owner came and gave me and my friend a rose stem each and wished us a happy new year. It was a great gesture!

            "review": "Have eaten the lunch buffet here at least 15-18 times over the course of 3 years, and I must say that Mt. Everest is finally in it's prime. I immediately sensed a new chef 2 visits ago, and my guess was confirmed by the owner. The owner was visibly excited about the new chef's contributions, smiling and describing all of the new dishes. Tastewise and lookswise, the buffet has never been better. It costs $1 more than before, but it is worth it. \n\nThe Sambar soup is perfectly seasoned, the new dishes (Chicken Chili, Vegetable Korma) are colorful and tasty, and the overall spice level is kicked up one notch closer to a straight-up medium. The Chicken Mahkani is masterful and complex - as good as some of the best Chicken Tikka Masala-type curry I've tasted. The Dal Mahkani is a 3 or 4-bean variety and is much improved over the previous chef's version. Great Samosas and Aloo Vegetable varieties. Very importantly, the buffet console is boiling hot so all of the food is steaming hot and remains hot on your plate several minutes after you sit down at your table. This is a huge detail that can make or break an Indian buffet. Mt. Everest nails it - keep it up! \n\nBusiness seems better than ever, which is a good sign that I'm not the only one who feels like this food has gotten really good. Typical to an Indian lunch buffet, the fresh-baked naan and roti are complimentary, but the whole wheat roti is especially good here - one would expect it to come out traditionally thin and flat, but the Mt. Everest version can be mistaken for a puffy naan bread - a nice surprise. Whole wheat roti has taken the place of white basmati rice in my Indian lunch diet.\n\nBuffet plates and bowls are clean and shiny. Water glasses are refilled constantly, every single visit. Finished plates are picked up quickly. Overall service is great. My only warning is you may smell like Indian food for the rest of the afternoon, so if you are on your way to an important meeting in a small office space, maybe bring a change of clothing if you are self-conscious about that kind of thing. I guess this is proof that when you eat the lunch buffet at Mt. Everest, you are immersed in a cauldron of Indian deliciousness.\n\nGo now and get it while it's hot! I've waited this long to write a review because if I really care about a place I want to make sure it's right before friends go try it for the first time. (see my Cravin' Cajun review)."

I thought the only way to get my fix was to fly back to the Bay to get it, BUT then I came across this place!\n\nI have probably driven passed this place a billion times before I considered to try it and honestly, it wasn't until I saw the awesome ratings from Yelpers before I decided it was a GO. Boy am I happy I did! EVERYTHING on their menu is so flavorful and rich! My boyfriend and I LOooOoOOOove this place. It's inside of what used to be a Burger King in front of the Mariana's Supermarket. The area isn't aesthetically pleasing, but don't you dare judge a book by it's cover! Their service is hospitable, kind of quiet and shy, but hospitable nonetheless. \n\nTheir Mango Lasse is amazeballs. Their chai is alright, probably wouldn't order it again though. The Papadams (spelling?) and the little sauces that get served before you order are so dainty and delicious! \n\nIf you ever come for their Lunch Buffet, don't plan on eating for the rest of the day, haha! They have an awesome selection and everything is fresh! We're so excited that we found this place. The boyfriend and I were talking about how we don't know why Indian food has such a negative social stigma when it's actually delicious. But I guess we don't really mind. MORE FOR US! :)"

It was mostly delicious, a little under-seasoned. One of the first things that is brought out is some kind of sausage (?), some battered veg and a pakora. That part of the meal was underwhelming. The sausage was very dry and the battered veg was just ok. Neither was too tasty. \n\nThere was a variety of 4-5 V and NV curries that were served along with rice and plain naan. The naan was incredible and had a bit of a crust which I've never seen before.

I had the chicken curry and my friend had the chicken tikka masala.  We also had an order of garlic na'an and cheese na'an.  First off, the garlic na'an was tremendous on its own, with great garlic taste.  The cheese na'an really shined in the masala sauce.  \n\nAs for the entrees, both were full of flavor and well spiced.  Plenty of chicken, and the sauces were great!  We both ate more than our fair share, and that was before dessert.  \n\nI really appreciate the warm atmosphere, the great food, and the fantastic taste of this place and would return in a heartbeat."

Stumbled upon this place on yelp and due to the great reviews I decided to give this place a shot. We were greeted and sat immediately. The food on the buffet looked pretty good so we went with that. Oh boy, what a good life decision that was! Just about everything I put on my plate was above average in flavor. Usually at an indian buffet there are at least 2 items that get left on my plate...Not here, the only thing I didn't care for was the potato samosas, and that's strictly due to the too thick, not crispy pastry surrounding the well spiced potato filling. The butter chicken was good,made with a mix of white and dark meat,and had a nice deep flavor throughout the chicken and sauce.  The paneer palak was wonderful and flavorful with a kick of chilies, My partner in crime enjoyed the veggie Korma greatly, as did I, it was creamy, with well rounded flavors and tasted very unique compared to other veggie kormas I've had. Heck it put mine to shame! They didn't shy away from spice or heat as some indian places do to adapt to American palates and I dig them for it. Service was a bit slow, plates weren't cleared as fast as I would've liked them to be, and my water glass was parched a few times but I'll cut them some slack for being a bit short staffed the day we went. Overall it was great!"

I went to both lunch buffet and dinner so I could just write a single review. I recommend going to dinner and ordering everything separately because I felt the food was extremely filling and although the it's only $11, you could only eat so little (1-2 plates). To me, it seemed like the dinner also had a little better quality but everything was still really good.\nIf it's your first time, I recommend going to a dinner first to get a meal that you are expecting and want. I don't recommend the lunch buffet for the first time because the food will not be as fresh or made with quality and that may ruin your view on the restaurant.\nHope you guys are apply to enjoy this restaurant as I did."

And the best part is they are not afraid of actually giving some heat to their dishes unlike some of the other Indian spots in vegas. \n\nThe food:\n\nFinally some heat with my lunch buffet food. The food here isn't too spicy it has just enough heat to get the job done. You start in the vegetarian section which has some amazing dishes then move your way to the meats. I love the chicken dishes and the goat curry is one of my favorites. You then move onto condiments and desert. Make sure to grab some plain yogurt and chutney to dip your naan into. \n\nService: \n\nIf anything is low just let the owner know and he has them cook it right away. Service is excellent water or soda glasses are kept full. If you come in after they stop cooking for the buffet the owner will let you know when you walk in. He will also ask you to go take a look at what he has out to make sure you would like to stay. \n\nAlso don't forget if you are just driving by during the lunch buffet hours you can grab a to go box and load it up for the same price as the lunch buffet. \n\nThis place is one of my favorite las vegas Indian food spots. It doesn't quite hit the same level as mint for me but it is up there."

Prakash and the fellas serve up some of the tastiest Indian cuisine I've ever had. \n\ndon't let the neighborhood (it's quite safe) or the former pizza hut exterior deter you, as soon as you walk inside it feels like an oasis. and the delicious smells of curry and tandoori greet you.\n\nthe chicken tikka, served sort of fajita-style, was tender and delicious, and spiced to perfection. the saag paneer, one of my favorite indian dishes, was savory and so inviting that i kept going back to it as i \"filled in the corners\" at the end of the meal, when i'd already eaten too much. we also had their lamb curry which was not a ground lamb curry but featured a generous portion of cubed lamb shoulder perfectly cooked and tender.\n\nthis is my new go-to spot in this ridiculous town.

Tandoor oven). In the 3 years, that I lived here I have yet to find an Indian restaurant that blows me away, but Mt. Everest is one of the \"better\" ones. \n\nCame here on a Saturday night around 7:00 PM. Not the best looking place from the outside, but still hopeful this was a diamond in the rough. The parking lot was full however, surprisingly there were only two other tables filled. However, towards the end of our meal the restaurant filled out.  My husband and I got there before the other couple joining us (it is one of their favorite restaurants).  The staff immediately greeted and seated us.  We had a few moments to look around...decor is a bit dated with the dark green upholstery, but well kept.  We ordered a bottle of wine from the limited but reasonably priced popular wines.  Once the other couple arrived, they were immediately recognized as familiar faces by the staff.  \n\nPrior to ordering we were served complimentary papadoms with the tradition mint and tamarind chutneys. We ordered Tandoori Chicken as an appetizer. This is a great value given there were atleast 8 pieces.  It came out sizzling hot, serve on a cast iron skillet.  I wanted to love it as its sight and sound captured my senses, but it was missing that aromatic smell.  That is right, it was not aromatic or flavorful...kind of bland for Tandoori, but nothing offensive and definitely well prepared.  Still worth getting, because it comes out fresh and sizzling, just spritz with lemon and sprinkle  salt it is more than fine.  \n\nShortly after our main dishes came out--palak paneer, chicken tikka, rogan josh, garlic naan, and a side kachumber salad.  First off, the portions were plentiful, and more than enough to feed four hearty adult appetites and two for lunch the next day.  The palak to the palak paneer makes that dish silky, creamy and very comforting, but could use a bit more spice although it was ordered at a level 6 on spice scale (1 to 10).  The chicken tikka was tasty and familiar in the sweet, tomatoey style...I prefer it slightly less sweet, but again, well made and worth trying.  The rogan josh's flavor was complexly layers and my favorite dish; it almost like my moms!  However, we ordered it at a level 10 spiciness, but it was much milder than expected.  Although I don't eat bread, according to my fellow dinners the garlic naan was fresh, warm and soft.   The kachumber salad was standard.  \n\nThroughout our meal,  the manager/owner(?) kept checking to make sure we were satisfied and of course, asking if we wanted more wine once we finished the bottle we order.  He gave us generously filled glasses for $5, and we had a friendly conversation.  \n\nOverall, the food was prepared with quality ingredients and with care, but lacked a bit of seasoning.  I haven't returned to many Indian restaurants in Vegas, but I am sure to return to Mt. Everest because the food is good, well priced, and the manager and staff is friendly... a special combination lacking in most Indian restaurants."

When we asked where the prawns were, the waiter tried to tell us there were large and small prawns, and these were small ones. LOL"

Yelp led us to a different Indian restaurant but because it was New Year's Eve and there was a ton of traffic crossing Las Vegas Blvd, we opted to go here instead.  We were happy with our choice!\n\nMy favorite Indian dishes are Tikka Masala and Palak Paneer with naan.  However, we saw that there was a dinner buffet line.  We asked, and to our surprise, it was only $10.99!  Sold.\n\nTypically, dinner buffets at restaurants have a limited selection.  At Mt. Everest, pretty much all of their entrees are included in the buffet.  I can't remember everything, but I know they had about 8 different main dishes (including my two faves above, and about 3 different curries), samosas, dessert, and fresh fruit.  They bring unlimited fresh naan to your table.\n\nEverything was so good.  We are definitely coming back next time we're in town.\n\nDefinitely worth the $11!\n\nI came here on New Years Eve and at the end of the night, the server gave me a rose.  How sweet!"

Fell sick after eating this food and that ruined my whole trip. Please don't take people's health for granted. I wish I could give minus stars.\nNow let's describe this in detail. First they served complimentary papad which was soggy. After all it was complimentary.\nThe vegetable korma had literally big pieces of vegetables. Ok option is you cut it and eat. What if the potatoes are not cooked, well in that case u can't cut. The cauliflower pieces were so big that I wondered whether they even had a knife in the kitchen to use it.\nNow the next was goat biryani. It had sweet corn in it, who puts sweet corn in a goat biryani. Well they just used the ready to use cut vegetables and that has corn. Plus they had all kinds of dry fruits which was never mentioned, people can be alergic to some kinds of nuts. Now the million dollar question, how was the goat. Answer is amazing and normal human being teeth can't chew it. It was so hard that I literally had to throw away most of the goat pieces. It seems that they thought that they had to simply put goat pieces in the rice. FYI the goat has to be cooked well before putting it in the rice. I can go on and on but never mind, all I can say I will remember this place for a long time."

For dessert gulab jamun and chai tea.  We did not really get what was on the menu as we didn't get salad or our dessert but Kheer rice pudding instead. I didn't realize this until looking at the online menu for this review. Either way- it's alot of food but would have been nice to get what we ordered. \n\nThe mix appetizer was some grilled sausage, chicken tikka pieces, a samosa and little papadam bites. It was a very big plate and was super filling. The main dishes were decent with the paneer being my favorite. My one thing was that the paneer and the dal needed a bit of salt, but still good. Raita was more tangy and watery than most I've had, but was good to dip my naan in. The kheer was very nice and not too sweet.\n\nChicken Korma ($12.99)- entrees come with rice. It was decent, but was more yellow curry flavor than other kormas I've had. \n\nWe also got some garlic naan ($2.99) thinking that there might not be enough naan with the mixed plate but if we didn't order this the plain naan would be more than enough. \n\nThe amount of food for two people with that is crazy. We had leftovers which I had for two separate and still very sizable lunches. We would have been very full and satisfied with just the mixed plate, but we had a restaurant.com certificate to use. \n\nService was okay. They started off good with drink refills when they came to drop off food. After a while they were doing tasks and seemed to be really into it towards of our meal so we sat there for a while needing things. \n\nOverall, the food here isn't my favorite Indian but decent. It definitely is the most value large portions than any others I've been to."

Complaints include: we finished a full plate of food before getting the opportunity to ask for naan (they didn't bring any to us), our booth was in a weird corner you had to squeeze into, and their women's bathroom wasn't super clean (although I imagine that was from a recent customer and not due to a general lack of cleanliness).

All the workers there were very kind, and quickly assisted us with whatever we needed.  We tried out their lunch buffet.  My family knew what they wanted to eat, I, on the other hand, was taking my time as to not knowing what I was eating nor I didn't know half of what the dishes were.  So, I kept it plain and simple and had the chicken tendoori, basmati rice, and also tried their stew.  All was good.  My family enjoyed each dish they got and loved every meal they ate.\n\nI came back again the second time around this time with a friend.  We actually both enjoyed our meals.  I kept it simple again, ordering the usual, the tendoori chicken with basmati rice.  My friend ordered some chicken curry dish also with rice.  We both had the plain naan and it was very good.  My friend and I would come back again to Mount Everest and perhaps try other dishes that they have to offer."

It was virtually empty when we arrived, and we were seated immediately.  I mentioned our coupon for $25 off with a purchase of $45 or more.  So we had to eat a lot!  Easy enough!  Our waiter, who I think was also the owner/manager, suggested the Tandoori chicken to start as an appetizer,  Eat a few pieces and take the rest home , which is what we did.  The chicken was that awful red color that you find on most tandoori chicken, but it was very moist and delicious as were the onions and peppers served along with the chicken.  Side note:  We have only had tandoori chicken at one other restaurant in town that wasn't that awful red, and it was the best ever.  But I digress.  \n\nWe ordered two kinds of naan, garlic naan and lamb filled naan.  The lamb filled naan was OK, but didn't have a real lamby taste, but the garlic naan - OMG  I could have made a meal on just that.  I wanted a lamb dish for my entree and Rogan Josh was suggested, and it was delicious.  Very tender and the sauce was perfect.  Put some on my lamb, the rice and scooped up some with naan.  My husband got a fish curry.  It seemed to me to be very much the same sauce that was on the lamb but with fish chunks in it.  I wasn't crazy about it, but he really enjoyed it. We also had a cauliflower and potato dish that we really enjoyed. I forgot to order raita, which I usually love with Indian food.\n\nWe too got a complimentary rice pudding dessert , which unfortunately we were too full to finish.  But it was delicious too, so next time I'll make room for it.\n\nI didn't notice the neighborhood.  It's in a strip mall with a large Mariani's supermarket behind it.  It's not inexpensive, but definitely not over-priced.  While it is number two on our list of favorites, it is somewhat less expensive and definitely closer to home than our number one, so we will definitely be returning very soon!"

Food is hot, fresh, and tasty.  You get both plain and garlic naan as part of the meal, all for $10.\n\nDinner is great as well.  Lamb and chicken dishes were quite tasty.  The only dish which has disappointed was the tandori which was flavorful but overcooked and dry.  I've tried it twice with the same result so I'm sticking with the curries."

Ordered Garlic Naan (Aweome ! sooperb), jeera rice (just too much of Jeera felt bit uncomfortable wile chewing), Mushroom masala and Paneer tikka masala along with Pakora - all prepared with perfect authentic propositions. Few of my friends tried Lamb Briyani and they said it was hard to bite. But on the whole we had a perfect diinner for our evening. Hall is very spacious and have very less  wait time is 1-4 mins.  -  Must try if you are in need to tasty good Indian food in LV"

Even though I was alone I was given a booth and made to feel at home despite the restaurant being crowded. \n\nI ordered lamb biriyani, keema, plain rice and garlic naan. Everything was amazing! It was far too much for me alone but I like to take leftovers home for the next few days. The biriyani was particularly flavorful and with lots of meat which is lovely! It's really hard to find keema in the USA at restaurants and this was a treat for me so I added as an extra... Tastes wonderful and authentic! And the portions are an excellent size. \n\nI had both rice pudding and gulab jaman for desert and both were delicious. It's really unusual for me to be so pleased with every aspect of the meal, but this was above and beyond what I was expecting. \n\nThe restaurant is clean and tidy and the staff are kind and attentive to your needs. The owner, Prakash was very keen to receive feedback and see if there was anything he could do to improve my meal. There wasn't! It was really a perfect meal and I'm a curry snob / takes a lot to please me!!! Oh before I forget I highly recommend the garlic naan! Very fresh and fluffy and tastes just like it should. \n\nI will be a regular customer, I am pleased to have been recommended!!"

Momos are like spicy xiao long bao with thick skins, or if you know real authentic Mongolian food (not those food court type places that basically reheat a pile of Americanized Chinese dry noodles for you), it's closer to a spicy buuz than an XLB.\n\nThis is Nepalese, not Indian. Our first time the owner took the time to explain some regional differences. It was clear that he is passionate about and proud of the food and culture of his people.\n\nAside from the owner, everyone was also attentive, polite, and good with refilling our waters.\n\nWe enjoyed everything we ordered here, not just the momos (though we liked those the best), and, what with the generous portions, ended up with enough leftovers to feed ourselves for days after. Mango lassi is pretty good here, not the best but nowhere near the worst.\n\nPROTIP: Never bother with the buffet, not just here but anywhere. Everything is much better (though more expensive) if you order it off the menu because they make it for you to order instead of it sitting out congealing for the entire service.\n\nUnfortunately you have no choice but buffet at lunchtime. It wasn't bad for a buffet. The tandoori chicken especially was tender and juicy, surprisingly not dried out. Some of the dishes even had a bit of kick for a buffet! (Usually buffets are pretty mild to cater to the lowest common spice denominator.) Favorites were the palak paneer (saag paneer), some aloo (potato) dish, tandoori chicken, vegetable samosas (relatively crisp considering they are sitting out on a buffet), chicken curry, and gulab jamun for dessert. Naan was also good and moist, not hard and dried out. Chicken tikka masala is on the sweet side. The goat curry was really tough, which was strange because it has been pretty tender when we've ordered it a la carte for dinner."

We arrived for the lunch buffet  which runs from 11 to 3pm for $10.99 per person.   They also serve dinner from 5 to 10pm.  For me, a buffet is the best way to experience food you are not familiar with.  Trying to guess what will look and taste good by reading a menu can be next to impossible.   \n\nI thought the Everest crew did a great job during my visit today.  The staff was efficient and friendly and it looked like only two people running the front of house of 30 tables or so.   The food selection was a good variety of one side that had all vegetarian options and another with meat offerings.   They featured about 12 different menu items including basmati rice, tandoori chicken, chicken Tikka masala, lentils, and one of my favorites was the pancake like balls soaked in syrup.   All of the offerings were hot and flavorful.   Once again a good reason to experience the buffet is because the food always comes out fresh, hot and often when you have a full restaurant. \n\nOnce we were seated the server brought out a fresh basket of Naan bread.  So happy they brought this to the table the bread was hot and had a perfect char on the exterior for extra flavor. Yum! Speaking to server on the way out he said they change some of the buffet offerings daily so you might have a different experience each visit. I plan on going back to Everest very soon and I recommend you try it also."

We were on the road and we were hungry.it definitely was not bad at all. I liked the salad bar and. The tamarind chutney. Just not spicey enough for me, alot of the vegetarian items on the buffet are made with cream, or butter. So i end up eating the few items that dont have dairy.even though it was not my favourite i would come back. What food they have was good, and the soup and salad are a welcome part of the buffet. Service was nice very attentive and friendly ++ on that"

We showed up and got seated right away. Very small, quiet place. All the employees were very nice and our server was very helpful with suggestions. There were 5 of us so we just got a bunch of different things to share. This dish I chose was the lamb masala! AMAZING!! Very sweet/spicy sauce and that lamb was cooked perfectly. By the end of the meal everyone was so full and the bill was very reasonable. Overall great experience and will definitely be back to try the lunch buffet!"

The exterior doesn't shout yummy Indian food; but the interior was nice and clean. I always check the restroom to see how well it is maintained before dining somewhere. It also was quite clean. There are booths against the walls & windows with round  tables in the center. There were several families and a few couples dining. \n\nWhat I really noticed was that everyone seemed to be having a good time and the conversations from the other tables could not be heard from where we were sitting. I thought that was a plus because you could have a private conversation or laugh at jokes without disturbing anyone else. They did an excellent job at seating their customers throughout the restaurant.\n\nAll in all, we were impressed with the quality, portions and price of the food. For starters, you get a basket of papadum with two little dipping sauces. We ordered Lamb Vindaloo (classic spicy lamb w/potatoes), Chicken Jel Frenzi (chicken with bell pepper, onions, mushrooms in sauce), Aloo Kauli (potatoes & cauliflower), and two orders of naan (garlic & keema/lamb). The dishes had wonderful sauces with excellent consistency for sopping up with naan. Everything was fresh, hot and yummy. \n\nThe service was good. The waiter never let our water glasses get empty. And the food came out as ordered in a timely manner. I will definitely put Mt. Everest at the top of my list for non-franchised Indian dining."

There was channa masala, palak panneer, dal, brinjal masala and couple more. I liked only the palak panneer. My wife is a vegetarian and to her, the vegetarian spread was just ok and naan was fine too. She was not very impressed. I moved on to the chicken items like tandoori chicken, chilli chicken, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry and goat curry.

A few reviewers have mentioned the sketchy surroundings, but I say if you can throw some carpet, a few tablecloths, and the drapes from an old bordello into a defunct Burger King and come up with a perfectly comfortable dining room, more power to ya! \nI have loved Indian food since I first discovered it during a brief sojourn in London, when it seemed that the only options were steak and kidney pie or starving to death. (I chose the latter. Valar Morghulis)! Anyway, as a person who considers curry to be more of a drug than a food, I'm usually prepared to like what I get in Indian restaurants, which is a little meat floating in a sea of delicious sauce which you happily sop up with some fluffy, toasty naan, and fill up on the rice.(I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it). The difference here was that there was plenty of tender, juicy meat in that sauce; apparently a side benefit of keeping the rent low. Hope they don't get too big for their britches and move to Summerlin. Goodbye, meat! \nI adore Chicken Korma and theirs was perfect; rich creamy sauce with just a little sweetness and those complex, spicy undertones that keep you coming back for more bites long after you're full. Chicken Tikka and tandoori were both served sizzling and still moist and juicy. The favorite appetizer, in a unanimous vote, was the lamb samosas. They were golden little pockets of pastry stuffed with seasoned, finely ground lamb, but the best thing was what wasn't there: My sister didn't find a hard thing. Mind you, if there is ground meat involved, be it burgers, sausage, meatballs, whatever, she ALWAYS gets the hard thing, and the rest of us have to suffer along with her. It's one of life's little miracles that she didn't, and practically worth a sixth star.\nWill definitely return to try the lunch buffet, but don't be surprised if they raise the price after our visit."

While the buffet is certainly worth the price I love coming for dinner so that I can order exactly what I want! \n\nThe garlic naan is a MUST. And I recommend it with some plain yogurt on the side! For main courses I really love the lamb (or vegetable) korma and the chicken tiki masala. I get both on medium (5) level and it still has a good amount of spice!! I'd say those two sauces are my favorites since I've tried others that are not as memorable to me. I don't love the chicken tikka but probably only because I'm a big sauce girl! I also really enjoy the okra vegetable dish! Full of flavor!\n\nThough the talk of slow service is true I'd say the food is too good to pass up and don't mind the service. I also like to finish my meal with a chai tea at the end. Overall great place eating so many delicious spices just makes me feel very warm and calm on the inside I would definitely consider this \"comfort food\""

Being pregnant, hungry and soon to be chubby, I ordered two main dishes. I love saag and I love masala sauce so I ordered both. My chicken tikka masala was good and made to order. My friend got that as well and liked hers. The hubby liked his curry, too. We had exceptional service that night. Where they get downgraded is that they without a doubt served me leftover saag from the lunch buffet. The spinach was browned like it had been left under a heat lamp all day, it had tell-tale paneer in it that they missed removing even though I ordered it plain, and it was spicy as hell even though I ordered it mild. So disappointed in this place for trying to pull a stunt like this. Even though I feel this place may still be the best in town...I'm now on the hunt for my new favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas."

My in laws had been to this restaurant before but this was the first time for my husband and I. We were not disappointed. The food was very tasty (but not oily at all), the buffet selection was wonderful (lots of chicken and non-vegetarian choices along with vegetables and dessert and salad). The service was excellent and the atmosphere was perfect.  My father in law does not eat naan and the restaurant offered to make him roti's instead at no charge. They are so kind!\n\nThe best part? At 9.99 per person for lunch, this is the best deal you can get! I wish they had a location where I live in California. I plan on visiting this restaurant everytime I come to Las Vegas.\n\nPlease visit this place next time you are in Las Vegas. I have nothing bad to say at all."

I'd definitely pass the place if I saw it since it looks very plain and the buiding is aging.  \n \nFirst, the price is great at under $8 for the lunch buffet. The manager and staff were very nice and attentive. We were seated right away, so no wait around 12pm.\n\nI tried everything, the chicken curry, chicken korma, veggie korma, palik paneer, dahl, soup, rice pudding, etc. with a hot Indian chai.The veggie korma was very creamy and seemed even better than the chicken, though the chicken was really good. This isn't diet food and we had a very light dinner since we were full all day. I saw some people get the buffet to go, which seemed like a good idea. At $8, you meet or beat the price of most other lunch spots.\n\nOther stuff: chai was as it should be. Nothing super special, but I'd order again. The garlic naan was different, but we prefer regular naan. The garlic changes the flavor of the food too much. Regardless, it's nice having warm, fresh naan brought to your table instead of having it sit on the buffet . \n\nDue to our complete, total satisfaction, the price and friendliness of staff, I'm giving a rare 5 stars."

I am a meat eater and my wife is a vegatarian, but there is so much for both of us. \n\nThe Chicken Makhani and Chicken Tikka Masala (these two rotate so you will get either one of the other) are both wonderful and there's always a few delicious vegetable dishes that are cooked and seasoned to perfection. Vegetables that I would never consider eating elsewhere are somehow transformed into pure delights.\n\nAlso excellent is the selection of pakora and the large, delicious Samosas (I usually manage to polish off three of these).\n\nFreshly cooked naan (so fresh you almost burn your hands if you aren't careful) is so good you could make a meal out of it and some of the sauce from the buffet alone. Our hosts usually offer us our choice of plain or garlic naan - or even both. They are eager to please their customers here at Mt Everest.\n\nQuite often I can tell when an Indian restaurant is going to be good by the number of Indian people eating there - Mt Everest attracts a diverse mix of clientele, yet does not fall into the trap of becoming too westernised.\nIf I have one small criticism it is that Gulab Jamun (a personal favourite) never seems to appear as the dessert on the buffet, but this is an extremely minor complaint.\n\nThe dinner menu is extensive with as many as ten options for each base type of food (veg, chicken, lamb etc). At dinner you get a free serve of papadums along with well priced servings that were a good 30% cheaper than in some of the local competitor restaurants and possible TWICE the size - Extremely good value and the dinner time Butter Chicken could be the best I have ever tasted.\n\nNote: You might want to look over all 1 star reviews of Mount Everest (and for that matter, all Vegas Indian restaurants) with a critical eye. You'll notice they are often from people who have written no other real reviews. I strongly suspect there's some \"review wars\" going on between different establishments. You'll notice they will always claim that staff are \"rude, disrespectful, etc\" - There isn't an Indian restaurant in Vegas I have been to where the staff have been anything short of gracious to the point of humble and Mt Everest is no exception. Don't believe the bogus reviews that claim otherwise."

I often find that single diners don't get the same quality of service as larger parties - I've always thought that this is due to the lower expected tip - who knows.   In this case I ordered an appetizer, soup, and main course, but the soup came out first and while I was about 3 spoonfulls into the soup, the appetizer and main course arrived.  Of course, by the time I got to the main course it was cold.  When the manager visited the table to ask me how things were, I told him how the food had been served and his response was to smile and walk away.  Otherwise, the service was prompt and pleasant.\n\nI had lamb filled samosa for appetizer which was overcooked and the meat dried out.  The Dahl (lentil soup) was watery and tasteless, and the $12 dish of lamb curry had about 7 small chunks of meat hidden in a lot of sauce.   For $2 extra I got about 2 tablespoons of chutney and another $2 for an equal amount of spiced pickles.  The best part of the dinner was the onion stuffed naan.\n\nMount Everest could be mistaken, both inside and out, for a fast food joint, except for the white cloth napkins and tablecloths.\n\nAgain, if 3 stars means A-OK, then this place should be 2 1/2 stars for Just OK."

Service is good and nice. With that out of the way lets talk about the food. Simply put...not good and not made with care. Samosas was searing hot on the exterior but had very cold spots inside. When it comes within 2 minutes of ordering...you know its microwaved and simply recycled from the lunch buffet. Mango lassi tasted like a bland artificial blend that was premade the day before. Mixed grilled platter was bland. Chicken was DRY, shrimp was overcooked, lamb was ok however. Chicken tikka masala was dry in terms of meat, the sauce tasted good but nothing noteworthy. The naan was NOT naan. It was too doughy, undercooked, and lacked in flavor. Lamb biryani tasted pretty good however and that's the only thing I can say I actually enjoyed compared to the other dishes. \nWould not recommend. I've tasted real indian food and this place is simply NOT it."

My only previous experience eating Indian was when I lived in nyc for 20 years. There is probably 2 million indian restaurants there....one for every cab driver. Let me tell you my friend, even the best one there could not compete with mt. everest. I remember the last place i used to eat at, called CHOLA. Supposedly it was great. Always packed with indians. Their food was always greasy and made me feel tired afterwards (probably from chemical, or cheap quality?)\n\nMt. everest is NOT like any other indian restaurant you have eaten in. The food is NOT greasy!!! The quality of the ingredients is fresh, and of high quality. I don't know how they do it...EVERY dish at that buffet is a solid TEN. \n\nI wish they would raise their buffet price to keep all the riff-raff like you yelpers out. Sadly, this place gets jam packed at lunch. \n\nThe best part is that a corona is only $3.50. I really appreciate it when restaurants don't try to RAPE customers on liquor prices.

I ordered the chicken Tandoori tiki, (hope I got that right... as I don't have my handy-dandy Asian Indian food guide close by...) and my wife, ordered the okra, which comes with basmati rice. We also ordered garlic nan, and for a specialty beverage, the mango lassi; a mango-yogurt drink. I'll say up front; \"Everything was very good, and the mango drink was very much like what we drink, Brasilian style, mixing papaya, mango or passion fruit, with various forms of yogurt, ice cream, or condensed milk. \n\nI bet I've passed this place twenty five times over the past few years when in Vegas on business. The building is old looking, near the bus stop at the front of an older strip center, and in an older section of West Vegas. But once you walk inside, see a relatively nice interior, and see the many regulars we saw, you're probably going to have the same high level of confidence we had.\n\nWhile service is stereotypical-etchnic restaurant-slow and spotty......... the food does deliver. It will never be as good as homemade, if you cook Indian at home, but then, as a Brasilian family, we rarely find stateside restaurants that meet our standards. That's to be expected. But having enjoyed Indian cuisine over the years, I'm comfortable recommending this restaurant.   \n\nI've added Mt. Everest to my \"black book\" of off-strip restaurants. If it's good enough for the many Indian clients I saw there tonight, then I'm sure it'll be good enough for you. Remember that Indian clients could go anywhere in town, but there was a good number of couples and foursomes dining in tonight. This alone told us it must have passed their test for authentic and good-enough-food/preparation quality to compete with their own home cooked meals.\n\nSo as they say in Vegas....... \"I'm in......\" at least for this Indian restaurant."

We went in for dinner although they do have a lunch buffet which I definitely plan on going to. We had the owner as our host who recommended their 4-course (I think) special. Came with papadums, chicken appetizers, a sampler selection of entrees, and pistachio ice cream. After talking with the owner and getting to know him he let us try the rice pudding which was absolutely wonderful too. The place was almost packed within 30 minutes of opening, and for good reason!"

            "review": "I woke up seriously wounded, defeated, +hungover on Saturday, and in a fit of hunger, I decided that my boyfriend and I needed to check this Indian buffet out. The price is right, at $10.99 per person. I also like how the lunch buffet is served every day from 11am - 3pm, which allows me enough time to catch up on my beauty rest on the weekends.\n\nTo my surprise, it was above average, very enjoyable; but mind you, not out of this world mind blowing. Plus, a small ounce of hatred flowed through me when I found out that they no longer served garlic naan for the lunch buffet...Man! I was really looking forward to that! \n\nI appreciated their authenticity in the spice department. Whew! They don't mess around. Some of the items on the buffet such as the veggie samosas and the malai kofta, had some shocking heat and I loved it! I didn't care for every dish they had available on the buffet - Some were too starchy or dry, but no worries, there were more than enough options to get me stuffed silly. \n\nHere are my favorites! \n- Fresh Baked Garlic Naan Bread - they were on top of refilling our basket and making sure we had hot, crispy, fluffy and fresh naan throughout our meal.\n- Sweet Rice (basmati rice sweetened with honey) - It had a very faint sweetness and flavor of honey, plus I loved the color!\n- Saag Paneer - The cheese curds were a little on the overcooked and hard side, but the spinach curry was very deep and flavorful. \n- Malai Kofta - It was interestingly sweet and packed full with flavorful spices, I loved the spicy kick it had. I really enjoyed dunking my naan in this one. \n- Chicken Tikka Masala - The curry flavor was rather weak on this one, but it was very rich and creamy. The chicken was very tender as well. \n- Tandoori Chicken - The chicken was tender and moist. \n- Veggie Samosa - Spicy city! I loved the unexpected spices that came through in each bite. It woke my taste buds up! \n- Mint and Tamarind Chutney - Refreshing and sweet. They both paired perfectly with all of the dishes and the naan. I especially enjoyed them with the samosa and the spicy curries! \n- Raita - Very refreshing and cooling for the heavy and spicy curries. \n- Rice Pudding - We loved the sweetness and the consistency with this rice pudding.\n\nI'll Pass: \n- Pakora - very dry\n- Aloo Baingan (eggplant and potato) - wasn't too flavorful or memorable. \n- Curry Chicken - boring flavor\n- Chili Chicken - dried out\n- Yellow Dal - too thick and flavor was not exciting \n- Chana Masala - not memorable on the spices and flavor \n- There were many other buffet items that just didn't stand out to me.\n\nAfter our lunch I had a minor stomach ache - but I'll blame that on my hangover and all that alcohol that was in my belly. Tsk tsk naughty."

I personally prefer vegetarian Indian dishes, and they did not disappoint. Aloo gobi was the best I'd ever had. The potatoes and cauliflower were cooked to the perfect tenderness and  had the perfect seasoning. The palak paneer was unique and savory. Chana masala was more acidic and fragrant than I am use to, but it was a welcome change. Don't get me started on whatever that sweet rice is called, it's orange, and is made with magic and cashews.\n\nThe non vegetarian dishes were quite good as well. The chicken tikka masala was creamy without being heavy. The goat curry was delicious, savory and perfectly cooked. The flesh fell off of the bone and was more tender than I thought possible of goat meat. \n\nAfter I mopped up the delicious remnants of my meal with the fresh crispy naan brought to my table, I realized not once did I find my water glass empty. The hosts were very friendly, and checked on us often at our table. Prakash, the benefactor of the restaurant, stopped by to make sure the food was to our satisfaction. After asking about taking some gulab jamun (a must try) to-go, he brought some over free of charge. Beautiful man. \n\nIf you want to eat Indian while in Vegas, THIS is where you need to go."

They did not tell us it was gonna be a long wait, and the couple that got arrived 30 mins after we did ate before us! They kept glancing over at us in pity since we had a hungry two year old. My daughter was very well behaved considering, so I don't know why they kept putting us off saying it was gonna take twenty more minutes for food. It happened at least three times. That's why we waited so long, because of the empty promises that our food would EVENTUALLY come out. I won't ever eat here again."

Prices are very reasonable: $8.99 and the selection is pretty extensive. There were at least 4-5 different vegetarian currey options and 3 different meat options.  \n\nAll the food was very fresh with tons of flavor. You're instantly smacked in the face with all the different aromas of the Indian spices as soon as you enter the restauarant. The service was also great. My water glass never got more than half empty before someone was by to refill it. I was very impressed. \n\nI think my favorite part of the whole experience was the Naan basket. They give you a basket of what looks like toasted pita bread, but it's so much better! It comes plain and with garlic and WOW the garlic naan was SOO good. I could probably just sit there and eat that all day. \n\nOverall, this was a good first experience. A little overwhelming since I didn't know what half of the food was, but it all tasted delicious."

I have ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala take out with Mt. Everest before and that sparked off my 'must have' mindset with which I now approach every trip to Las Vegas.\n\nI confess that I will easily come here more than once per single work week because that is how good the food is.

It was good but I'd probably try something different next time. Seems like it's made out of leftover samosas.\n\nWe also got raita which was good but a little tarter than I like. The garlic naan was yummy. \n\nFor main courses we had prawn biriyani and mateer paneer. The prawn biriyani was tasty though the rice was on the al dente side. The matter paneer had a nice sauce. \n\nThe dinner was good overall, but there are better Indian restaurants in town."

I was anticipating this place opening as soon as I saw the sign that it was an Indian restaurant AND had lunch buffet so when it finally opened, we had to go.\n\nIt did not disappoint! The lunch buffet is 8.99 and there is a great selection of food. It's not the BEST Indian that I've had but for the value, it is excellent!!\nThe thing I also appreciated was the naan was included with the meal and you didn't have to pay extra for it as I had at other Indian restaurants. They give you a choice of either plain or garlic so we went with garlice. It was awesome! Hot and fresh from the oven, had herbs and plenty of garlic to our liking.\n\nThe service was great as well as the servers attended to our table and made sure our drink glasses were never empty. They checked regularly to ask how everything was.\n\nAll of us left VERY full and happy with our experience at Mt. Everest. We will definitely be returning regularly for lunch."

I like that they have sweet rice, because that makes me think of my mom's sweet rice, and well nostalgia makes everything taste better. They have a nice selection of meats too. I've NEVER seen a lunch buffet serve goat meat. Gotta give the props on that one. The naan is fresh and fluffy. I like that they give you both plain and garlic naan. Their roti is decent.

To our disappointment, the drive-through window isn't operational.  Going inside, I expected fast-food furnishings and decor to match the outside of the restaurant.  No way!  White tablecloths and cloth napkins!  Waiters attending to the patrons.  And best of all, fragrant, delectable Indian cuisine - at a $10.00 lunch buffet!\n\nThe disappointment of the non-working drive through window was completely forgotten once we experienced the excellent food.  It was so good that we kept embarrassing ourselves, \"mmm!  Mmmma!  Oh my gosh this is so GOOD!\"  \n\nEvery dish was fresh, seasoned perfectly, not greasy, gamy or too salty.  Occasionally they even changed the food, putting out a completely different dish in place of something that was there before.\n\nThe naan was amazing.  I could go there just for the naan.  They offered more, but we had to say \"no thank you,\" because the rest of the food was so good.\n\nThe vegetarian dishes were at a separate warming table than the chicken dishes.  This speaks volumes for how they care for their customers, and I'm sure the vegetarian customers appreciate this.\n\nThe service was impeccable.  Our water glasses were kept full.  Even the water was good - no chlorine taste.  \n\nThey didn't bring a check so we paid on the way out.  But that might just be how they do it there, which is fine by us.  We gave the highest tip percentage that we give due to the fine service and quality of food.  We will definitely be back.  This is now officially our place for Indian food.\n\nWe just went back again today.  It was every bit as good this time.  And they offered an accommodation for our disabled son without our asking for it, which was very kind.  We'll be back again soon."

I was surprised, but didn't say anything.  \n\nThe restaurant itself was really dark inside, there were no lights turned on at all, just a little natural light coming from the small heavily curtained windows.  Nice surroundings and kind interactions make food taste better in my line of thinking, so this restaurant just failed in these respects.   \n\nThe buffet itself was fine, nothing was amazing nor was anything bad.  After we sat with our food, the same manager brought a basket of naan and actually TOSSED it down onto our table as he walked by without even making eye contact with us, still jabbering away on his phone.   My husband and I just looked at each other and laughed, it was that bizarre!\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back.

I can't remember when a Indian resturant got away with pulling that stunt off.

I've only recently discovered this hidden gem!\n\nI'm not experienced in Indian food, run-ins with curry and the occasional purchase of naan from Costco were about all I knew.  But wow...what a flavor bomb Mount Everest is!  Very unassuming restaurant on the outside..BAM!  Get your taste buds ready!\n\nIf you're very new to Indian food I urge you, start off slowly.  The multiple (and I mean multiple) spices used to make a majority of the food can be very overwhelming.  Indians are not shy with spices and they will throw everything in the book at you!  That can be a very good thing!  Wake up your senses!  Tastes from everywhere will be making your brain go BOING!  To be honest there must be a dozen or more critical spices used in Indian cooking, all present here at Mount Everest, I'll just name a few:\n\n*Cardamom\n*Clove\n*Black pepper\n*Cumin\n*Coriander\n*Nutmeg\n*Mustard seed\n*Fenugreek\n*Turmeric\n*Saffron\n\nAre you ready?  Thought I was but I really wasn't!  For your best options, go for the daily lunch buffet.  You get to try a little bit of everything that Indian food has to offer.  There are some definite familiar dishes along with a few that are great starting points for newbie Indian foodies.\n\nOnly a beginner?  Go for the tasty Chicken Tikka Masala over a bed of their Sweet Rice.  Sweet, spicy, but not too spicy!  Also go for the Tandoori Chicken, marinated in yogurt, garlic, ginger & herbs then grilled over charcoal.  Delicious!\n\nMore experienced?  Go get it with their Chicken Curry or their Goat Curry (yep), try a Veggie Samosa or Pakora.  Don't forget the dipping sauces!  Raita, Mango Chutney, and Tamarind are ready to accompany all of your entrees!\n\nVegetarian?  The buffet also offers a few good options like Palak Paneer - homemade cheese cooked with fresh spinach & herbs.  Or the Aloo Kauli - potatoes & cauliflower cooked with tomatoes, peas, cilantro, roasted cumin & coriander.  \n\nPlease, please, please don't look a gift horse in the mouth - each table comes with a basket of freshly baked naan bread!  This is critical!  The curries, Hell just about everything goes excellent with the naan bread!  It's sooooo good!  Sop up all the extra goodness off your plate with a piece of naan!  If you get a chance order a basket of the garlic naan as well.  Carbs be damned!\n\nMount Everest is possibly the best Indian buffet around currently.  If you go for the lunch buffet be prepared to wait.  Tables are often full with regulars!  But it is totally worth it for the flavor explosion you will be receiving.  The price isn't bad either, $10.99 a person...what a deal!  Eat to your heart's content!\n\nI've only been to Mount Everest for the lunch buffet, but I hear the dinner buffet as well as the regular menu is on fleek as well.  I will have to come back to give either of them a go.  But for right now I am happy with my lunch buffet for my Indian fix.  I will be back!\n\nEverybody in the world....SPICE UP YOUR LIFE!!"

I will round up to 4 stars overall.\n\nI was craving Indian food so decided to check out this place for their lunch buffet. The interior is a bit worn, but it is clean and the workers are all very friendly.\n\nThere were a decent amount of dishes in the buffet, but not all that many to be honest. All of the food was tasty, and there was a good variety. Chilli chicken made an appearance again, and I'm starting to think this Indo-Chinese dish is a Las Vegas Indian buffet staple. While chilli chicken is indeed a very popular Indo-Chinese dish, I never saw it in Indian buffets when I lived in California or in Virginia. \n\nThe meal comes with freshly baked naan, and there is no surcharge if you want garlic naan, though it does take a little longer to prepare and you have to ask for it. Water is included and served in cute mason jars, and the servers were pretty diligent about refilling waters and clearing used plates.\n\nOverall, at $10.99 for a lunch buffet, Mount Everest is a good value and has decent food. It is not the best Indian buffet I've ever had, and nothing particularly wowed me or stood out, but it is a solid restaurant for sure.\n\nP.S. I find it ironic that the restaurant is called Mount Everest India's Cuisine even though Mount Everest is located in Nepal. xD"

Worse Indian cuisine I've ever had, would not go back. Also it's located in a terrible part of town.

Perhaps in Las Vegas it may be considered one of the best but I've had many Indian cuisine experiences mainly in the valley of L.A. where theres many Indian places. But the food lacked somewhat here. The first thing I was surprised at was the garlic naan bread was not included for dinner, although it was good. First time I've ever seen an Indian restaurant not serve it as complementary. The chicken tandoori was a little dry and mostly smothered in bell peppers, onions, and cilantro. Cilantro??? Had I known about the cilantro I would have requested without it. No basmati rice either although it specified in the menu that it came served with rice. Tikka was exactly the same. Now that I know a couple things about this place I may try again but order carefully. I was with a party of 6 and everyone was eh so so about the food. We were all pleasantly surprised with the service."

I would say service was a solid 4 stars (although there was a bit of the soft upsell here on beer and extra side items like multiple orders of naan), but food was 2 stars, 2.5 stars tops.\n\nI really like the strong and bold flavors of Indian cuisine, and also the quality of the sauces, which tend to be very smooth, with supporting notes of texture like cashew or other items to provide some 'tooth' to a dish.  I found the sauces here to be very heavy, a bit 'gloppy' and just lacking in quality - the sauces just weren't inviting to me.  Actual taste of the sauces was ok - serviceable, but nothing great.  \n\nAlso, lamb was pretty tough, and chicken had small bones (the kinds that should not be in a dish, small enough to catch in one's throat and cartiledge - just unappetizing.  Paneer dish we had was one of the better items, but sauce still had that heavy and unpleasant texture.\n\nI have not yet found an Indian restaurant in Vegas that measures up to Origin India in its heyday."

            "review": "I've been there for lunch and I've been there for dinner. This is my favorite Indian food in Las Vegas. The flavors are all there, but it's not as expensive as many other Indian restaurants in town that I find to have less appealing food.\n\nAs far as buffets go, their lunch buffet is excellent. They always have several of my favorite Indian dishes available and they keep the warm, fresh, pillowy naan bread coming. The only problem I have is that I overeat every time I come here for the lunch buffet.\n\nLast night was my first time trying their dinner menu, and it was so delicious. We started with vegetable samosas which were cooked very well. The had a perfect crisp on the outside and beautifully seasoned potato filling inside. Then for our entrees, I ordered Lamb Vindaloo and my wife ordered Chicken Kurma, and we both ordered garic naan to go with it. (Unlike many other Indian restaurants in town, Mt. Everest doesn't charge extra for rice. I very much appreciated that.). The Lamb Vindaloo was the best I've had. So flavorful! The Kurma was very tasty, but a little too sweet for my tastes. My wife loved it though and couldn't stop raving about it the entire meal. She's already mentioned to me how much she's looking forward to eating her leftovers.\n\nSomebody in a previous review seemed to think the fact it's in a building where a Burger King used to be, and in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood is a bad thing. Me? I don't care where it is or what used to be there as long as delicious food and great service provided. This place has both. \n\nThe owner even brought us out a free rice pudding for dessert for us to try. I don't think that's standard for all guests, but it was delicious. I would recommend Mt. Everest India's Cuisine to everybody."

The selections were somewhat limited, but the food was pretty good.  They bring naan to the table.  Those who have eaten at other Indian buffets know that this is a nice touch, because it seems that you always have to wait and fight for the naan if it is on the buffet line.  The workers were friendly and efficient with water refills and plate removal.  Strangely though, they did not come to refill the soft drinks.  \n\nLike I said, this used to be a Burger King.  With that being considered, the decor was nice.  The white tablecloths are a nice touch.  The parking situation can be a bit dicey as it is located in front of a busy market."

For me that means no monkey business in the kitchen...you always assume there's not but I've seen too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares.\n\nThe goat was so-so...kinda fatty and lots of bones, was hard to find a good piece in the whole tray...for $10.99 perhaps that's not enough to cover a lamb substitute and maintain profit.\n\nI think what was missing today were my sweet monkey balls that seem to hit the desert spot and some beef korma...my favorite dish...I think they had it last time.\n\nDespite this not being as good as I first remembered...it's still the best Indian buffet I've tried (been to about 3)\n\nOverall a good spread and I will be back...call it 4.5 stars."

I dined solo and arrived around 1:00pm (buffet ends at 3pm). The food was still hot & delicious. The rice was still soft. And it wasn't too loud or too busy. The server and the manager were so incredibly polite. They periodically checked on me to make sure everything was to my liking and my water cup was always filled to the brim!\n\nThe food was awesome! A variety of lamb and chicken curry. A few vegetarian options. The samosas were on the salty side but still incredibly delicious. They had plain rice and a bright orange sweet rice which was awesome but I preferred to eat the plain rice with all the sauces and meats. The naan was fluffy and as delicious can be. ! I managed to scarf down a whole basked by myself!  Next time I'll be asking to try the garlic naan too.

This was a great balance of flavor amidst the kick in my mouth.  (I did ask for mild)\n\nI came here for dinner and not going to lie was a little turned off by the outside.  Very seedy looking place.  Then I stepped inside and saw that it was decorated in a comfortable manner.  Clean and efficient enough.  (at least for appearence's sake!).  They brought out some papadum and a couple sauces to go with it.\nI ordered the shahi paneer which was good, (not the best I've ever had but again i'm partial to homecookin). \nOne little complaint I had was that I needed to ask for water a couple times as I tend to drink a lot of it while eating.  This is usually a given at higher end places, but as there was only two people working and it was rather busy i'll give them benefit of the doubt.  Also when I asked the waiter if I should try the shahi paneer or the paneer tikka masala he said he didn't know because he didn't eat vegetarian food.  (in a slightly rude manner)\n\nOverall worth the trip and they provide a solid indian food experience."

It smelled like all the beautiful spices I miss from my Indian friends cooking for me back home in Chicago. \n\nWe were greeted and shown to a table, and told that we could go ahead and start on the buffet whenever we were ready.\n\nFor $10.99 per person, I thought that the buffet was nice.  \n\nLots of choices!  \nFirst round, I tried almost everything...I was a little stand-offish about the goat curry.  I've never had goat before and was nervous, but I did try it second round.  \nMy favorites: \nDaal (lentil soup):  really spicy and full of flavor.  Its good on its own or over the basmati rice. \nChicken Tikka Masala.  Uh.  YUM.  Tender chicken in a rich and creamy sauce...mmm.\nVegetable Samosas:  Delightful.  Lightly spiced, and delicious.  I went back for thirds of these, and they are really nice with the mint chutney.\nNaan:  I had hoped for the garlic Naan, but alas, we only got the regular.  That's ok.  It was AMAZING.  My fella's favorite of the day was the naan dipped in the tikka masala sauce.  SO delightful!\n\nI liked the Aloo Baingan (eggplant and potato), but it was just a tiny bit too spicy for me.\nI found the goat curry very thin/greasy looking in the sauce, and it was honestly hard to get a couple pieces of meat, as there were so many bones.  It was a little fatty for me, but the flavor and cook was good.  I would be willing to try it again.  \n\nThe tandoori chicken was just kind of \"meh\" for me.  My fella loved it.  I'm not usually a big fan of chicken on the bone though, so I know that had something to do with it.\n\nService was polite and quick.  Our water glasses were never empty, and we received our naan in a timely manner.  I loved the Bollywood music and videos playing too.  \n\nAll in all, this was a good experience for me.  It wasn't mind blowing, but I found the food very tasty.  I would definitely return, and recommend it to anyone looking for good Indian Food."

            "review": "Let me start by saying that the food is delicious (on most days). My review will be covering my lunch buffet experience only, so please keep that in mind when reading.\n\nPros:\nPlenty of variety - Chicken tikka, tandoori chicken, saag paneer and so forth. The naan is freshly made, but be sure to mention custom requests such as Garlic naan etc while you are being seated (or they assume you want it plain).\n\nCons\nWhile the food quality ranges from good to excellent, the customer service is lacking, depending on the season. The owner is a really chill guy, but he seems have 1 person working ALL the tables sometimes (which gets chaotic during lunch rush, and customer service suffers).  I've noticed he's hired more staff lately, but I suspect its only seasonal. My note to him - Keep your location well-staffed :) \n\nI love their carrot dessert (gajar halwa), which is light years better than the sugary Gulab Jamun. They have a salad bar, which is decent.\n\nMy advice to readers - You better make sure you are leading an active lifestyle, if Indian Buffet is your goto for lunch. Although the food here is tasty delicious goodness, its not really good for your body :/ Authentic Indian food isn't this greasy or creamy, and most Indian people don't eat like this.\n\nBecause of the health implications of eating such loaded items, I tend to go there once every 2 weeks...maybe once a month."

The sweet rice is the bomb. My water never went empty. I don't think it ever got even half empty because they were all over keeping it full. We both had the buffet, we shared a large beer, and it only cost us $40.... Including tip. We will for sure be back to dine here again. Thank you My Everest for a fantastic lunch!!"

I tried their vegetarian dishes and loved all of them. Kadhi pakoda was delicious as well as potato zucchini. Their dal tadka was ultimate. For an Indian like me, I thought their spice level was medium, not too mild like in other restaurants. They serve Naan on the table, which was hot and soft. Dal makhani could have been better. \nThe restaurant was also clean and we were served well. I would definitely go once again."

At lunch you can either have the buffet or order from the menu; at dinner you order from the menu.  Many of the items on the lunch buffet vary from day to day--some days there will be chana masala, some days vegetable korma, etc.  It's always great.  I actually like ordering from the menu better, though.  The owner is a very nice guy and works hard to make sure his customers have everything they need.

We came for the lunch buffet which was $10.99/person. \n\nBUFFET ITEMS:Vegetable korma, yellow daal, chana masala, vegetable samosa, sweet rice, basmati rice, vegetable pakora, chicken tandoori, chili chicken, chicken makhani, chicken curry, goat curry and the BEST part was that they had my favorite GULAB JAMUN!! \n\nThe chicken curry was very flavorful, it had a great balance of creaminess and spices. It also contained big chunks of chicken which is what most people tend to skimp on (abundance of protein is always a plus in a buffet dish). I was surprised that they had goat curry (gamey stuff is not my cup of tea so this one I did not try). The gulab jamun were little balls of perfection. \n\nSERVICE: our server was very attentive and quick to refill our glass of water.\n\nI subtracted a star b/c although the gulab was legit, they only had the gulab and rice pudding for dessert. There was no mango pudding or the carrot halwa the sweet carrot dessert, but I guess you can't have everything. I also wasn't a fan of their naan that they offered. A good naan has a little bit of crispiness and SOME flavor. This NAAN HAD NO FLAVOR whatsoever and was very thick and heavy. It was more of a PITA than a NAAN. \n                  \nFor $10.99, I would come again."

            "review": "I have been craving Indian food for a while. Haven't gone to any of the well known places in town until today. We were downtown  and close to a few Indian restaurants  and decided on Mt. Everest for lunch. \n\nThe minute I opened the door, the aroma of Indian spices welcomed me in. It brought back memories during my years in The UAE. The place looked clean, the staff were friendly, attentive and helpful....and the food was really good. They serve hot buttered naan with the meal. I requested garlic naan and they happily obliged. I excitedly went around the buffet to check what they had to offer. The first thing that caught my eye were the samosas. It was hot, freshly cooked and pretty good. More doughy than what I'm used to but still good. Then I see the chicken curry and goat curry in the very corner...boom! Be still my heart!  Those two dishes didn't disappoint at all. The goat pieces were so tender and the gravy was addictive. The chicken curry was equally good. I couldn't stop dipping my naan in the gravy. The chutneys totally complimented the curries. I also tried their chicken tikka and their chicken tikka masala. They were ok. They also had about 4 vegetarian dishes but everything pales in comparison to the curries. For dessert I tried kheer and gulab jamun. Their kheer was refreshing and not overly sweet  with a slight cardamom taste. Gulab jamun is good too but too sweet for my taste. \n\nThe place got pretty busy around 12ish. They had a lot of South Asian clientele which is a good sign. The owner, Prakash is nice and friendly. He was constantly making sure that our needs were met. We left happy and full. \n\nPrice for a lunch buffet : $10.99....definitely not bad! \n\nI wish they served biryani during lunch but no worries. This place is definitely worth trying. We will be back!\n\nOur verdict:\n\nService - 5*\nFood.    - 4.5*"

You get a bit of everything.\nLike previous reviewers, this place is owned by Nepalese. When you drive up it looks almost like it is dark, not open from the outside, but I think thats because of the glare stuff they have on the windows for the heat during the day time.\nThe service was great.\nWe ordered a vegetarian Thali and I ordered the Mt. Everest Thali, which came with lamb, tandoori chicken and butter chicken, along with the vegeterian options.\nNormally at other indian restaurants I never get appetizers with the Thali. This came with the usual Paperdums, which had both mint chutney and tamarind chutney, which was made fresh you could tell.  In addition to that we got pakoras, fried califlower, and appetizers size chicken pieces and lamb.\nOurs came with dessert. Rice pudding and Gulab Jamman. The best we have had thus far. The Gulab was nice and firm and the syrup was thick not watery like I normally have experienced. \nWe also ordered chai. It came in a big 32 oz cup, like a take-way, and was made fresh because it was pipping hot. My boyfriend wanted to go back the next day just for the tea!\nHighly highly recommend this, especiallyif you know your indian food, much better than Tamba on the Strip."

The buffet line itself wasn't very large, smaller than anticipated. The standouts for me were the samosas, chicken tikka masala, and goat curry. The goat curry was almost like a very tender beef pot roast. Unfortunately I think the tandoori chicken suffered from being on a hot buffet line because it was extremely overcooked and almost inedible, though you could taste the flavors. It was a bit of a shame.  There was also an eggplant and potatoes dish that was extremely tasty.  \n\nUnfortunately I got full quicker than I wanted to, and one plate for me was enough. Though I wanted to go back for seconds of the tikka masala. \n\nService was efficient, with several of the guys always pitching in to refill waters and take away used plates. Don't know if dinner time is different, but at lunch the employees seem to not wear any uniform and just wear casual clothing. Which there's nothing at all wrong with, but at times it was hard to tell who was an employee and who was a customer. \n\nMount Everest doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is some tasty food to be found."

The booth had white linen table cloth and white cloth napkins with better than the usual flatware and water goblet.  Unfortunately, lunch is ONLY the buffet for $10.99 [it is not clear if this is ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT].  A menu is only for dinner.\nThe buffet had a \"sneeze\" shield with sticky notes with handwritten names for whatever was under the shield.  The labels were for the Indian name of the dish; not very helpful if you're not an Indian speaker.\nThe \"wet\" items were soupy and the \"dry\" items were dry to an extreme.  The two best items, IMHO, were the chicken curry and the white rice, while the others were forgettable.  The condiments I normally associate with curry [like coconut, peanuts, grated onion, etc. were absent; although the chutney was present, but unremarkable as chutney].\nI would hazard a guess that those giving five stars are native speakers and are familiar with the food in the buffet.  Since I'm neither, this made things awkward."

I didn't think there naan was good, didn't try the sweet rice, and the samosas were overcooked.  \n\nWell, wow.  I have been back like, 7 times in the past month since that initial visit.  It is by far my favorite Indian lunch buffet place.  I had 3 in the running but Mt Everest is on top.  First, the price.  I believe it is 10.99... not bad.  Second, the choices.  It has the most choices I've seen!  What could make this place better?  If their labels were more specific.  I love the way some buffets put \"vegetarian\"; as a 75% vegetarian I like a quick reference guide to vegetarian options.  But... with my minor knowledge of Indian food I know what most of their dishes are.  If it were my first exposure to Indian food, however, I would be S.O.L!\n\nAlso another thing they could make better.  Their naan.  I don't like their naan.  I like buttery, garlicy soft guusy naan.  This is not my favorite place for naan (Saffron is).  If you like medium-textured, little buttered, barely garlic-ed naan then you would like it.  Other than that, it's so good!   Their choices are amazing.\n\nFinal thing (this is the Nutrition student in me):  They are so sanitary!  One of the only Indian buffets I've seen with in-place \"sneeze guards\" on their buffet.  Their buffet is actually buffet style so it has the coverings.  Furthermore, their bathroom has a sanitary spray above the handle.  How great!  So even if nasties don't wash their hands, I won't get their germs from when they open the bathroom door open.  Foodborne illness is no joke, yo.\n\nP.S.\nTry the sweet rice!  \n\nP.S.S.\nThe Bollywood they play on TV is a great compliment to the atmosphere."

(We went there yesterday and walked out immediately cause food dont look fresh) come to mt everest and experience a day of indian cuisine:)"

We grow up eating the stuff, there are more Indian restaurants in England than Mickey D's. Really! Would I embellish? Maybe but I don't think so in this instance.\n\nAnyway, Friday night and the kids ditched us. Outrageous I know, but gives Wifee and I a rare chance to eat what we want. \"Yuhi K. recommends a place down on Sahara\" I explain. \"Who is Yuhi K.?\" asks my leader. \" She knows about food\" I explain unconvincingly.\n\nIt is a long drive down W.Sahara from my hood and Wifee is viewing my choice with suspicion. \" It will be great\" I proclaim \"be patient\". \n\nMt.Everest sits in front of a slightly rundown strip mall but parking is easy and my expedition was a success.\n\nWe were greeted promptly and offered a table or booth. Booth. The greeter/server guy seemed to be the owner. He was great. Recommended a great beer, Taj Mahal, 1.5 pints of frothy cold delight, Wifee grabbed a nice cold Chardonnay.\n\nWe started with a mixed dish of samosa, kebab, chicken tikka and some other stuff. Fantastic and more than enough to share.\n\nMains: I had a Mushroom lamb dish, I am asked how spicy I would like. being a big shot expert Indian food eater , I asked for 7/10. Too hot! I'm such a wimp after many years away from Blighty, Really quite pathetic. I tell my server/owner/guy. No problem! He took it away and brought it back re done at a more acceptable spiceness. ( I'm pretty sure that's not a word, sorry). Delicious! Served with rice and a garlic naan. \n\nWifee has Chicken Saag, she ordered 6/10 on the heat scale. Perfect!\n\nWater was always topped up, drinks were offered frequently. Really great and we are going back. Often. \n\nThanks Yuhi K.!!!!!"

This opening line would work much better if you couldn't already see the 5 star rating I'm giving them.   Yes, this is that Sushi Mon all you can eat and then some, pants button undoing type of stomach pain, and not the having flashbacks of the Subway employee not washing his hands while making your Sweet Onion Teriyaki chicken sandwich type of pain.\n\nI wish I could describe what I ate in detail, but the truth is I have no idea.  On the first plate I tried everything on the right side of the hot buffet items, which resulted in a plate of rice and an assortment of deliciously spiced veggie and chicken dishes along with some Veggie Samosas and Pakoras.  After a while, sauces were blending into each other, pakora were getting smothered with various other items, left became right, black became white, and soon a harmonious melting pot had been achieved on my plate that rivaled any buffet experience I've had.  With each bite I had no idea which item(s) I were eating, but they were all fantastic.  Some of these bites provided quite a kick and the quickly refilled iced tea and water were much appreciated.\n\nI had no need for a 2nd plate.  I had no room for a 2nd plate.  Someone should have stopped me, but alas, they didn't.   Walking up to the buffet line, the only game plan I had was to try everything on the left side that I didn't try the first time.   Chicken Curry, Chicken something else, Chicken something else.  Done.  Unfortunately I also couldnt resist some more Daal, some more samosas, some more pakora.  3 bites in I knew I was in trouble.  12 bites in I started to hurt.  20 bites in I tapped out.   Now an hour later I'm finally starting to recover...\n\nYou may have won the battle Mount Everest, but I will be back to win the war."

They have a spice level system of 1 to 10, we get 7 since we like a good kick to the food.  I like it really hot and had 8 once, which was hot and good for me but too much for my wife. She still loved it but had to eat slower.  7 from now on!  Naan is super fresh with nice crispy and soft textures. Samosas are crispy in the outside but not overdone, and fresh.

            "review": "I have been eating Indian food since the 80's. At that time, in Nor Cal, there were no restaurants that I knew of, that served Indian food. I got my weekly fix at my BFF's house, courtesy of her mom. I drank chai almost daily as an after school treat. Her mom is vegetarian, so I always ate the same thing at her house: some type of dal, rice, yogurt and fresh made roti. Flash forward to today, and that is still pretty much what I eat when I go for Indian. \nWe have only been to the buffet, so I can only base my review on the lunchtime offerings. I highly suggest that as you are being seated, you ask for garlic naan, if that is what you want. I stress, WHILE you are being seated. They are fast at this location and you will end up with plain naan if you don't speak quickly. They encourage you to start right away and your water will be waiting for you when you bring your first plate to your table. The naan will quickly follow. The samosa is vegetarian, along with a few other dishes. I have only had samosa, dal, rice, tandoori chicken, garlic naan, yogurt mixture and kheer. They are delicious. The only thing I would like to see is plain yogurt. I am not fond of the yogurt mixture, but I eat it because I cannot imagine eating  Indian food without yogurt... naan and/or roti. My man loves this place so much that he does not want to go back to Mint. I think Mint is good, but have had a plate get cold while I waited for my naan.\nThe staff is pleasant and the place is small, but has air conditioning.\n\nEnjoy."

I dream about it. The owner is so down to earth and nice. He always recognizes me and my family and is so kind to us.

Which was a platter of mixed appetizer, papadam (Indian chips) chicken tikka masala, dal makhani, palak panner, lamb curry, chicken tikka (4pcs), rice, naan, raita. When the platter came out, I honestly didn't know which was what, but everything was SO good!\n\nWe also had the Tandoori Chicken. This was my favorite dish we ordered. It was chicken baked in a clay oven, marinated in yogurt, garlic, ginger, herbs, and spices on an onion and bell pepper bed on a skillet. All the dishes were so flavorful from the spices. And the portions were huge! We ordered a lot for just us two and only spent $43. But we had yummy leftovers to take home. :)\n\nService was quick and friendly; always kept our waters full.

I've been able to try many things that I would have never ordered (goat curry - yum!) but there are also always some of my favorites.  Their dinner menu is reasonably priced (especially with a Groupon) but the lunch buffet is definitely the deal to get if you're in the area at lunch time.\n\nThe first time I went the location was a little scary - it's on the corner next to a gas station and Mariana's supermarket and the outside is not super bright.  I was a little nervous, but as soon as I stepped inside I felt much better.  It is a cute place - tablecloths on the tables, well lit (not bright but definitely not \"shady\"), and the people are SO nice.

It was okay, cost was $10.99 for a buffet and space is a bit small. Server was right there to greet us when we came in and sat us down at a table and told us to go up to the buffet.  \n\nThe first part of the buffet was all vegetarian items and I tried the Chana Masala, which was peas and potatoes in some curry and it was nice and hearty, but did leave a peculiar aftertaste. Nothing bad, but nothing familiar and I've had a lot of Indian food in my life. The samosas were huge, but some were lukewarm and didn't like that the exterior didn't get as puffy as they can. The pakoras were somewhat stale and awful! Boo.\n\nAll the meat options at buffet were chicken with the exception of goat curry. Favorite was the chicken makhani (Butter Chicken). Very good aroma and flavor and the meat was well cooked. I didn't enjoy the piece of Chili Chicken I decided to taste. Overly sweet and not enough balance. The tandoori was okay, but nothing memorable. Was excited to try the goat curry hidden in the far left back corner of the buffet and the small pieces of meat I was able to extract from the pool of curry was good, but there wasn't enough. Obviously somebody came around before and scooped up all the delicious pieces of meat and left the curry all sad and alone :( Even sadder they didn't refill the pan with some fresh goat curry.\n\nGood food, but nothing amazing and I don't understand how this place got such high ratings. Too much good Indian cuisine in Sunnyvale has spoiled me, not to mention the months of Indian I feasted on while I lived in London. This was a letdown, but still an above average to good lunch buffet."

I and other members of my family have probably had everything on the menu but being a creature of habit, my favorites are: lamb saag, chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, mushroom mutter masala, keema naan.

I found it while going shopping at the Mexican market next door (didn't buy anything, kinda crappy selection, but I was looking for a horchata).  Anyway, it is not a large selection for a buffet.  But the items that they have are very good.  There is half for vegetarians and half for meat eaters.  I usually get a lot of the tandori chicken and lamb with curry. Their dessert rice pudding of some sort is pretty dang good too.  I think it is a staple of most Indian restaurants but they do it well here.  I usually grab 2 co-workers and use buy 2 get 1 free coupon and pig out once per month during lunch hours.  Dinner is the same but they dont have the buffet.\n\nThe place is clean and the nan bread comes out hot. I told my friends this was a hole in the wall, and it is on the outside, but inside is tastefully done.  On the wall is the obligatory Indian dramas who dance away the whole time you are eating."

All the workers there were very kind, and quickly assisted us with whatever we needed. My friends and I wanted to try different things and share, so we ordered a prawn curry, chicken biriyani, garlic naan, and a very very spicy chicken biriyani.\n\nWhen the food arrived, I felt like I was in heaven! Everything smelled so good and looked so flavorful, I immediately started to dig in. \n-The garlic naan was amazing, and felt like it just melted in my mouth. I even ordered another round because it was SO GOOD. \n-The prawn curry was the right amount of spicy for me and very delicious. It was big enough for us to split between 3 people.\n-The chicken biriyani was very flavorful and had tender chunks of chicken mixed inside. It was definitely something I would order again!\n\nMy first trip to an Indian restaurant was a good one. I hope to come back sometime soon and try out something new!"

As stated I can't tell you what you should try and get here because I'm ignorant on this cuisine .. I know from this visit that I love love their chicken Momo.. I also learned some dishes I don't like but that is trial by fire or if you dine here and the manager / server notices a pretty full plate he offers you something else to go which ... Hey  I don't know indian yet but I do feel I am very versed in good quality and amazing service ..\n\nPrice wise this place isn't cheap but I didn't find it expensive for what you get , overall it's worth the drive to come to Everest from the north side of town but if you're in the area and want some delicious yum Yum food like the masala or garlic naan check this place out !!!

We went there for the buffet on our first day in Vegas(they were packed). After the lunch experience, we made sure to visit on our last night for their dinner. Both my other-in-law and wife were impressed, and can be difficult for my mother-in-law. The quality of food was  every bit as good as many Indian cuisines I have paid much more for. The lunch buffet I would give 8/10. Options were more than the typical Indian buffet I visit. They are generous with their meat portions, and quality as well. The dinner steps up the class a bit from lunch but with reasonable pricing still. Some may find the Indian TV music station playing in the background a bit distracting, but we found that it added to the ambiance. The food quality and spice complexity was improved over the lunch selection. The portions were large. We shared an order of momo(dumplings) and 2 entrees between 3 people and had leftovers. The momo was just as good as we get in Nepal, but that makes sense as the place is owned and operated by a Nepali family. If you know anything about Nepal, you know the reputation they have as being kind and hospitable people."

A very good selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes.  Most everything I tried was absolutely delicious.  I went back for seconds and even thirds.  The next day, I came back for more!  \n\nThe restaurant was clean, the decor tasteful and comfortable.  The price was very good too. \n\nCareful though, all that curry can get to you.  ;)"

We had Chicken Tikka Masala (fabulous) we were eating the sauce by itself when the chicken was gone, Rogan Josh (lamb) was tender and NO FAT.  The Naan bread was fluffy and crispy.  I'm not a beer drinker but our server Prakass suggested that we try the Indian beer, Taj Mahal.  Loved it. The food portions are generous as well.   Will definitely return"

            "review": "Right off, I'm very stingy with giving out stars and I'm not likely to assign any value to the outside of any place.  This restaurant is not much to look at from the outside but is a medium to small restaurant that is pleasantly decorated inside with a friendly staff.  The lunch buffet is served in some of the nicest heated tables (one iced table for the cold menu) with covered chafing dishes.  The food is kept hotter than any other buffet with dishes refreshed regularly.  The one meat table is separate from the vegetable tables, a nice feature for vegetarians to avoid cross contamination.\n\nEvery dish was delicious.  Although I would have liked to have one main potato dish (there were potato samosas and a great mixed vegetable dish with potatoes) and would drop up to half a star for the menu selection, the food was fresh, perfumed, and not overly South Indian hot.  The obligatory Tandoori Chicken was both flavorful and moist.  I suspect that the heated tables and covered chafing dishes help maintain the quality of the food.  The pakora were a little crunchy, maybe not perfect, but tasty.  Given that there are no half-stars, the only negatives were not worthy of dropping to four stars considering our overall satisfaction.\n\nWe arrived for a late lunch, around 1:30, but the food was great and refreshed before the dish was emptied, keeping the quality up.  The plain naan arrived before we were back from the buffet and I would have liked to have garlic naan, but no one asked.  I guess it is important to ask right away for naan other than plain, but the plain naan was good.  The service was fine with dishes cleared and water refilled, but a little invisible and surprisingly shy.  For any questions, just call out for them -- they really don't want to disturb your meal.\n\nOverall, the fixtures were superior, the dining room was kept clean, and every dish on the buffet was terrific.  Not quite the huge selection found in some of the buffets in Silicon Valley, but it was all good.  Hard to believe that any other Indian buffet in Vegas will beat this spot for quality and value, this is now our go-to Indian restaurant for Vegas."

The restaurant seems like a family owned business and the customer service is wonderful!! They are super nice, friendly, and seem easy to get their attention if you need anything. There's also a TV playing in the corner with current Indian movies with plenty of bollywood dancing and hip current Indian music.  \n\nThe usual dishes we order are: \n - appetizers: vegetable pakora and samosas, thinly spiced cracker (don't know the name of it - sorry)\n - main dishes : tandoori chicken, palak paneer, chicken korma, chicken makhani, lamb curry (rogan josh)\n - sides: garlic naan and rice\n\nThe appetizers are very tasty and a good size that come with a mint jutney sauce and a spicier sauce.  All the main dishes are very good also.  Warning though, if you ask for spicy... these dishes can definately make you sweat like a banshsee!! just ask my bf!! I like them milder and ask for mild or a level \"3\" and they are delish.  Maybe \"5\" or higher will be too spicy and possibly not enjoyable... but up to one's palate.  The tandoori chicken comes out on a sizzling plate and the chicken is so tender and tasty, always a safe bet.  The chicken makhani (butter chicken) is my absolute favorite! The korma and curry are pretty rich in spices and have very distinct flavors to the dishes.  I think the palak paneer is alright but reminds me more of creamed spinach - so maybe a pass.  \n\nThis place is small and cozy but usually hopping with customers.  The food may come out a bit slower when they are busy but it's worth the wait.  Always happy with the food and service here that makes me keep coming back for my Indian food fix!!  I really need to come for the lunch buffet which looks like a great deal for the same food."

Prices are always very reasonable for the portions provided, and the staff is happy to tailor the level of spice to any palate without losing the key flavors. The atmosphere of the restaurant is always warm and welcoming with soft lighting and a real ceiling with better acoustics for a good talk over a meal (rather than the new fad at restaurants of a large cavernous warehouse ceiling and raucous noise requiring you to shout at your dinner companion.) My personal favorites are the momo, the butter chicken, the paratha, and the mango lassi, but every dish we have tried is of the highest quality and flavor. I highly recommend Mt.

I think it paired perfectly with the chicken curry.\n\nThe service was awesome, too! Being first timers, they were all very helpful.

My water was refilled once in the whole visit, but the check was promptly delivered before we finished eating. \n\nThe food quality is WAY down. I couldn't cut the chili chicken with a knife, it was dried to jerky. My favorite, richly flavored makhani is now a strangely over spiced lackluster sauce. \n\nThe overall quality has taken a major hit in the owner's absence.

It is an All You Can Eat Indian buffet with all sorts of Indian dishes for just $10.99.  Believe me when this very reasonable price of $10.99 is worth way more than the price you pay. Each time I've been here for lunch it's been packed with people spilling out while waiting for tables to free up.  There's even not a lot of parking.  Most of the time these are good signs of how delicious a place is and this was the case here. Is it authentic Indian? I wouldn't know but a few of my vo-workers from India like them too, though I haven't seen others from India dine here at the same time as me.\n\nI never asked what a dish was or what's inside so all I can say is that I enjoyed them all, the green stuff, the orange stuff, the yellow and brown stuff, the stuffed bread stuff, and the fried battered stuff, all very delicious. They were labeled but I don't remember what each was because I usually sample them all. There was a red chicken, not to be mistaken for char sui, and another meat dish. Ask for the Garlic Naan, the freshest right out of the oven?? the better.  They do have non-buffet options.\n\nIt use to be a Burger King so imagine that kind of space on the inside and they have a TV playing films from India. Customer service is usually fast and friendly so the only reason that I think there's a long wait is because they are very good and those there first are enjoying the goods."

(f.y.i i even checked before i left to see if it was refilled and still NOTHING.)\n\nservice wasn't all that great either. the owner was busy on the phone the whole time, didn't give much attention to his customers.\n\nwhat was good before WCAP (went cheap after popularity):\n+ we use to be seated and now he just points to a table for use to go to.\n+ we use to get our water refilled without having to ask and now i have to wave down the waiter. \n+ we use to get the bill brought to the table, now we have to go up to the cashier\n+ the rice pudding dessert use to actually have the consistency of pudding and now its super runny\n\nFINAL NOTE: you can try this place if you've never tried it before, its not horrible but it wasn't what it use to be. BUT if you have ate here before, stay away or you'll be just as disappointed in them as i was. (never going back, goodbye mt. everest)"

            "review": "This review is really for how they set their price point with regards to children. I've been a regular  here since my kids were 4 and 6 yrs old and now they are 6 and 8 yrs old. The problem I have is this, they don't tell you much kids pay for buffet. In the past I've only paid half so I thought that's okay,  when I came here this weekend I paid full price for both of my kids even though they did not eat as much as me and my wife and so I wondered. Any other buffet restaurants in Vegas they would have paid half price, since they are just kids. Most restaurants (casino or not) based their pricing on children's age, if your kid is over 11 or 12 they pay full and so on and so forth. I asked the guy who took my payment on why my kids pay full price when they are 6 and 8. He told me they based the price on how much a kid should pay based on much they eat, I say what??That is ridiculous, what if my kid is not a big eater, how can they assess this, by putting their plate on a weighing scale? I feel like I was scammed and for that this restaurant just lost a long time and loyal customer. It's misleading, I might even think of bringing a complain to BBB. Going somewhere else next time, for everyone else please be warn, if you bring your kids you don't know how much you will be paying. Should have went to SURA korean BBQ, half price for kids, more selections and cheaper overall!"

The awesome guy I order from called me out on it today -  considering how often I come to this joint,  it was time for their five stars.  \n\nAttentive service.  Solid Indian food.  Wonderful lunch buffet.  Great to-go service.  I'm never disappointed with my visit. Sad they simplified their menu.  It's super simple to point and order,  but I do miss seeing the full name of what I'm ordering."

Lol\n\nAnd all the food for only $10.99...is a steal. But I would recommend coming on a day that u are not working.  I'm at the gym now trying to get over the food coma trying to work off some of that yumminess. :D\n\nAnd yes there are no pics because I was too hungry to take pics.  So come on by and take your own pics.  Lol"

Bollywood movies play in the background as I wait, and then dine on my Chicken Mahkani  my 'go-to' meal when I come here. The Garlic Naan is bar none, and I could really just eat that as a mea,l in of itself. The Basmati rice is always cooked to perfection and a nice accompaniment to the entrees. Las Vegas' Best Kept lil secret! Who needs fancy deco when you can have fancy Indian food at an extremely reasonable price. Vegetarian options are always available.  A GREAT first date place..snd a GREAT Happily Ever After regular. LOVE this place!"

I threw out some suggestions and after long debate we all had our hearts set on Thai, we were quickly disappointed when we found out that our favorite thai restaurant was CLOSED for the day, and so were the 3 other Thai restaurants that I called :(! \n\nSo we went to choice number two which was Indian Food. I went onto my HANDY DANDY yelp app and found Mount Everest, I skimmed through some reviews and some people loved it and others didn't. \n\nMy father can be a serious food critic, and he is not afraid to voice his opinion so I was a little nervous and hesitant ... I called ahead and made sure they at least had some good beers, in case the food sucked .\n\n\nWe left my parents house at 4:27pm and We arrived at the Restaurant at approximately 4:45pm, my father was skeptical and kept telling me they were closed, I assured him it wasn't... \nI failed to informed him that I had called ahead of time to make sure they had alcohol . \n\nthe restaurant looked completely dark and there was not much Activity going on anywhere \n\nAnyways, \n \nafter sitting in the car for about 2 minutes my father got restless and wanted to stand outside, so we go outside and stand by the door in like 45 degree weather and within minutes all these people began to get out of their cars and coming from all different places ...\n\nThere were about a good ten people waiting behind us . I felt better ...... This seemed promising ! At exactly 4:58 they opened their doors, I know this because I kept looking at my phone because I was freezing! \n\nTheir dinner is from 5-10.\n\nWe were all greeted right away and we sat at a booth. They took our drink orders.\nThe restaurant was clean and pretty. It was very well staffed . \n\nWithin 30 minutes of opening every single table in there was full . \n\nI ordered a Mango Lasi\nMy father ordered a Taj Majal of course\nand my mother odered a Tea :)\nand a round of waters\n\nThe mango lasi and the beer came out first and then they informed us that the tea was going to be ready in about 15 minutes. \n\nThen we went onto order our food, we were famished so everything sounded absolutely wonderful. We ordered a variety of Vegeterian dishes because my mother does not eat meat and some meat dishes for my father an I.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nGarlic Naan \nPaneer tikka Masala \nRice \nAnother rice dish that I don't remember the name \n\nChicken tikka \nVegetable pakora \nAnd other stuff \n\nAnd for dessert we had kheer and gulab jamun :)\n\n\n\nI was not a fan of the vegetable pakora but my mother loved it . Everything else was delicious and warm ...\n\nAnd most importantly ... My father was a fan! \n\nAnd I'm also a fan!! \n\nI tried to take pictures of everything and label it correctly . \nBUT I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE FAILED !\n\n\n\nWe'll try to the lunch buffet . Hopefully it's just as wonderful . \n\nAlthough,\n\nRemember that tea my mother ordered ..... Well she never got the tea . They must have gone to India to pick the leaves or something ....\n  \nIt's ok though, the customer service and the food were Great"

I prefer the lunch buffet. \nIts hard to have Indian cuisine for lunch for me because most places seem more upscale and a dinner style establishment.\nNot here! They make it very inviting and laid back! \nThe buffet option gives opportunity to learn about most dishes you have never ordered before. It was great! Sample some of everything.\n\nMy favorite was the Palak Paneer. Spinach with homemade cheese. If i could eat this with every meal for the rest of my life I think i would!\nChili chicken is very good too!\n\nThe spice level was perfect for me, If it gets too hot try a mango lassi drink!\nI don't usually drink sweet stuff with my meal, but this drink actually compliments and cools the spice! Very good!\n\nI always suggest this place to friends. I will go anytime!!"

They bring out fresh naan for you and the service is always amazing. The young gentleman that is always there is so sweet and nice. The food is consistent every time I go there and they always keep the stations clean. Never been disappointed with the food nor the service. I even went on a day where the health inspector came unexpectedly! the place was so packed and busy and the young gentleman/server/cashier was able to keep up with everyone's needs, clean up and talk to the health inspector. Keep up the good work!!"

            "review": "Another lunch favorite!  I've been several times for lunch, and always eat at the buffet.  The food is delicious; there's various traditional options, including basmati rice, samosas, chicken dishes (e.g., chicken tikka), dal makhani, and other vegetarian dishes.  There's also fruit.  The buffet actually has a good variety of food.  \n\nMy absolute favorite is the sweet rice, which is orange colored and has peanuts (or cashews?) in it.  I have a sweet tooth and love rice, so this is the best of both worlds for me.  I'm not a huge meat eater, but am not vegetarian either so I end up loading up on the sweet rice.    \n\nMy runner-up favorite (or actually maybe tied) is the naan.  Whoa nelly, the naan is ALWAYS warm and soft.  We always get a basket that has plain naan and naan with garlic.  The garlic naan is super good.  Although I'm sure it's a huge faux pas, I love getting the orange marmalade from the buffet (for the fruit) and putting just a little on the naan.  That's my dirty little secret at Mt. Everest.\n\nOverall, it's a great place to have lunch.  It's generally busy or at least half way full.  I think it also feels a little nicer because the tables in the center of the restaurant have linen table cloths.  Oh! And another plus -- they usually have a Bollywood movie playing on a flat screen tv above the buffet.  The sound is not on or is low, but it's fun to watch nevertheless!"
